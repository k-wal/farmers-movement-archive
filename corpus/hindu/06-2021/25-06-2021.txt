25 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||PM backs delimitation exercise, grassroots democracy in J&K||Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated his government’s commitment to fostering grassroots democracy in Jammu and Kashmir during his meeting with 14 leaders of eight mainstream political parties even as he sought their cooperation in first completing the delimitation exercise for Assembly seats in the Union Territory, which would eventually lead to elections. He said this at the first outreach meeting between the Union government and mainstream political leaders of Jammu and Kashmir — a meeting, which by all accounts, was held in a cordial atmosphere. Both Mr. Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah reiterated their previous public commitments to restoring statehood, government sources said. The sources said in his address, Mr. Modi said, “ Dilli ki doori kam honi chahiye aur dil ki doori bhi ” (The distance from Delhi — the seat of central power — and the distance between hearts should both be reduced) to convey the spirit in which the meeting was called. While every party spoke about the restoration of statehood, the contentious issue of special status to Jammu and Kashmir, which was removed by the reading down of Article 370, was also raised but many parties spoke of it as a legal fight as the matter is being heard in the Supreme Court. After the meeting, Mr. Modi indicated that it was the first of such outreach efforts, tweeting: “Today’s meeting ... is an important step in the ongoing efforts towards a developed and progressive Jammu and Kashmir.” He added that “delimitation has to happen at a quick pace so that polls can happen and J&K gets an elected government that gives strength to its development trajectory.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/pm-backs-delimitation-exercise-grassroots-democracy-in-jk/article34959137.ece
25 June 2021||MANGALURU,||Life is returning to normal after Unlock 2||Life is returning to normal in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts after Unlock 2 with almost every activity being permitted to be conducted in a regulated manner. The lifeline of the districts — private stage carriage buses — however, are yet to commence their services in a full-fledged manner even as the Karnataka State Transport Corporation (KSRTC) has resumed services based on demand. While normal activities are permitted in Dakshina Kannada district between 7 a.m. and 1 p.m. (by 2 p.m. everything has to shut down), such activities go on till 5 p.m. in Udupi district. Owners and operators of non-essential services and shops have cleaned up their premises and are awaiting customers even as people are coming out cautiously to conduct routine business. KSRTC, said its Mangaluru Divisional Controller Arun Kumar, has deployed over 160 vehicles in Mangaluru and Udupi regions as on Thursday and operating services on important sectors, including Udupi-Mangaluru, Udupi-Karkala and Udupi-Kundapur, besides operating some long-distance services, including those to Bengaluru and North Karnataka regions, to their regular timetable. City buses in Mangaluru have started operations on important routes, he added. Operators of non-essential shops as categorised by the government, including textile, jewellery, stationery, electronic, home appliances, footwear and other similar items, have almost reopened in the two districts even though the footfall is fewer. While a few private bus operators have resumed services in Udupi district on skeletal basis, very few have deployed their buses in Dakshina Kannada district. Having surrendered bus permits after public transport was banned during the lockdown, the owners are now vary of resuming services at the end of the month considering the full road tax component. This, despite Deputy Chief Minister Lakshman C. Savadi announcing on Wednesday a 50% rebate in road tax for all public transport vehicles for June.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/life-is-returning-to-normal-after-unlock-2/article34959329.ece
25 June 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||Government cancels SSC, Intermediate Board exams||The State government has cancelled the SSC (10th Class) and Intermediate Board examinations. Education Minister Adimulapu Suresh told a press conference that following the Supreme Court direction to complete the entire process of the examinations, including the declaration of results by July 31, the State was left with no choice but to cancel the exams. The Minister said after reviewing the apex court’s ruling with the officials of the School Education Department and the Board of Intermediate Education, it was decided to cancel the exams. “We have only Intermediate final year practical exam marks of the students available with us. A high power committee will be constituted to evolve patterns to be adopted for evaluation and allocation of marks,” said the Minister. Responding to a reporter’s remark on government’s “indecisiveness” on conduct of the exams, Mr. Suresh said there was no ambiguity on the government stand on the issue from the beginning. ‘Always in favour’ “We were always in favour of conducting the examinations keeping in view the students’ academic future. We mentioned the same in the affidavit filed in the Supreme Court. But now that the apex court has fixed a deadline of 10 days and it is not possible to complete the entire examination process by July 31, we have decided to drop the exams,” Mr. Suresh said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ap-cancels-intermediate-ssc-exams/article34959113.ece
25 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Notify Class 12 assessment plan, SC tells State Boards||The Supreme Court on Thursday directed State Boards to notify their respective schemes for internal assessment of the final marks of Class 12 students within the next 10 days and ordered them to declare the results by July 31. A Bench of Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari refused to entertain a plea for a “uniform scheme” of assessment to be made applicable across Boards in the country. The court said each Board, whether the CBSE, ICSE or State Boards, was “autonomous and independent”. They could formulate their own schemes after consultation with experts. However, the Bench clarified that allowing Boards to form their own independent schemes did not preclude the court from judicially reviewing their correctness and validity when an occasion arose. By directing the State Boards to declare their results before July 31, the court ensured that students across the country get a level playing field in college admissions and other opportunities for higher studies. Earlier, the CBSE and the ICSE had agreed in the Supreme Court to announce the internal assessment results of their Class 12 students by July 31.

25 June 2021||KALPETTA,||More rosewood logs seized in Wayanad||The Forest Department on Thursday seized nearly 16 cubic metres of endangered rosewood logs from five sites in the district. The logs had been kept in private coffee plantations at Mukkamkunnu, Makkyanikunnu and Pakkam, near Vazhavatta, in Muttil South Village after felling it reportedly from revenue pattaya land, Forest Department sources said. “As measuring of the timber logs is under way, the exact figure can be ascertained only after the assessment,” a source said. Wood shifted However, 8.2 cubic metres of the wood was shifted to the timber depot of the department at Kuppady on the day and cases were booked against three persons as per the Kerala Forest (Prohibition of felling of trees standing on land temporarily or permanently assigned) Rules, 1995, sources said. The forest officials had also seized 202 cubic feet of rosewood illegally axed from revenue pattaya land under the village and shifted it to the Kuppady timber depot nearly four months ago. The massive rosewood-felling came to light after the Forest Department officials seized 54 pieces of illegal rosewood timber worth Rs. 60 lakh from a saw mill at Perumbavoor in Ernakulam district on February 9. The wood was transported from Wayanad to the saw mill without valid documents and the seizure was made on the basis of a tip-off.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/more-rosewood-logs-seized-in-wayanad/article34959390.ece

25 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Court flays govt. over plan to hold exams||The Andhra Pradesh government’s insistence to have its students brave the pandemic to attend Intermediate exams saw the Supreme Court adopt a hard line on Thursday, saying the State will be held responsible and even be made to pay Rs. 1 crore as compensation in case of deaths. A Bench of Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari asked the Andhra Pradesh government what it was trying to prove by risking lives when other States across the country had opted to cancel their State Board exams. “Are you trying to prove you are different? Nobody should try to prove anything here… This is about lives,” Justice Maheshwari addressed advocate Mahfooz A. Nazki, for Andhra Pradesh. “Unless we are convinced that you will be able to conduct exams without any fatality, we will not allow this exam to be held. When other Boards have cancelled their exam, you want to prove you can… are you trying to do that?” Justice Khanwilkar asked. Justice Khanwilkar said the “State will be responsible for any fatality… Remember, there are States which pay Rs. 1 crore to frontline workers, we will have to think something on those terms in your case”. The court grilled the State about the ambiguity of its eight-page affidavit on the why and how it plans to conduct the exams by July-end amid the pandemic. “Have you not seen there is a new variant of the virus called ‘Delta Plus’… The Centre has said that some States — Kerala, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh — are more prone to this variant… We don’t know how this is going to pan out… We cannot say, neither can you, what will happen by the end of July,” Justice Khanwilkar highlighted the uncertainty written large in Andhra’s exam plans. Seating The court asked the State to explain the statement in its affidavit that it would seat only 15 to 18 students in every exam hall. “You say you have 5.19 lakh students taking the Class 12 exams. Simple maths shows you will need 34,634 rooms if you seat 15 students to a class and 28,864 rooms for 18 students to a room. Do you have the space for that or are you planning to conduct exams in the open? Show us a screenshot of your records on the decision… The rooms, again, should be well-ventilated. Besides, you will need over 34,000 invigilators… You have made statements in the affidavit without showing us how you arrived at this decision or how you plan to carry it out,” Justice Khanwilkar told the State government side. The court asked whether the State had a “contingency plan” if the COVID situation got worse midway through the conduct of the exams. Justice Khanwilkar asked when the State would declare the results if it intended to conduct exams only by July-end. “Students in CBSE, ICSE and other Boards would get admissions, your students would be left out,” Justice Khanwilkar said. Mr. Nazki said he would take instructions on the issues flagged by the court. The Bench scheduled a hearing on June 25 at 2 p.m.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/supreme-court-pans-ap-govt-over-plan-to-hold-class-12-exams/article34959116.ece

The remaining 2,334 eligible beneficiaries have been vaccinated, and this is a model village for the State,” he told reporters on Thursday. He said that Tiruvarur MLA ‘Poondi’ Kalaivanan had taken up the initiative to achieve 100% vaccination and created awareness among the residents. This was the village where a memorial of former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi was coming up. At the national level, Weyan village in Bandipora district in Jammu and Kashmir had earlier achieved 100% vaccination coverage, Mr. Subramanian said. The Minister said that in every district, the government had decided to prioritise vaccination of persons residing in villages near tourism destinations where public converge and places where there are memorials. “Accordingly, work to vaccinate all tribals and tea estate workers in the Nilgiris is in progress. All of them will be vaccinated in 10 days,” he added. Similarly, the government was aiming to achieve 100% vaccination in districts with less population such as the Nilgiris and Ariyalur, he said.  On patients covered under Chief Minister’s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme (CMCHIS), he said from March 23, 2020 to May 6, 2021, a total of 1,466 persons were covered under the scheme with an approved amount of Rs. 6.95 crore. “After the DMK government took over on May 7, a total of 20,938 beneficiaries were covered under CMCHIS till June 23. The approved amount was around Rs. 266 crore. There was an appeal to include patients affected with mucormycosis under CMCHIS. Accordingly, a total of 423 persons affected with mucormycosis were treated under the scheme, with the approved amount being Rs. 1.27 crore,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/kattur-village-achieves-100-coverage-with-first-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine/article34959245.ece

Himself a Maintenance of Internal Security Act detenue in 1976, Mr. Singh cited how the Constitution was systematically subverted by the BJP. Farmer leader Prem Singh Gehlawat recalled how Prime Minister Narendra Modi had “deceived” the people with populist slogans before the elections and was now “blatantly serving the corporate sector at the cost of toiling people”. Satyawan, another farmer leader, said agriculturists from Haryana would assemble at Nadda Saheb Gurdwara before marching towards Raj Bhavan to submit the memorandum urging the President to prevail upon the Union government to amicably settle their demands.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/farmers-to-observe-save-democracy-day/article34959276.ece

25 June 2021||Navi Mumbai,||Thousands protest over naming of airport||Thousands of people from Raigad, Thane and Palghar districts of Maharashtra gathered on Palm Beach Road and staged a protest on Thursday demanding that the under-construction Navi Mumbai international airport be named after the late Peasants and Workers’ Party (PWP) leader and parliamentarian Dinkar Balu Patil, who was popularly known as D.B. Patil, by August 15. Protesters from Uran, Panvel, Thane and Mumbai converged on Palm Beach Road and near Killa junction outside the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation headquarters. The demonstrators, including project affected people, registered their protest over a proposal to name the airport after Shiv Sena founder late Bal Thackeray by dancing, playing musical instruments, and performing Vatt pooja. “The performances are part of our culture and it was showcased to display our unity against this decision. Just like our art and culture, D.B. Patil too is an integral part of our lives. Whatever we are today is because of his struggle for the project affected people of Navi Mumbai. We are the sons of the soil and the government cannot ignore our pleas,” said a protester from Uran. The protesters also raised slogans against the State-run City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO), which is executing the project. The core members of the All Party Action Committee visited CIDCO Bhavan and submitted a letter demanding scrapping of the proposal to name the airport after Bal Thackeray, which was sanctioned in its board meeting. The members threatened to stop construction of the greenfield project if the demand was not met by August 15. In December last year, State Urban Development Minister Eknath Shinde had written to the CIDCO, directing it to send a proposal to name the airport after the late Sena supremo. The proposal was subsequently granted sanction at a meeting of the CIDCO’s board members. On June 10, the State government also announced that the proposed airport would be named after Bal Thackeray. Dashrath Patil, president of the All Party Action Committee, said, “CIDCO is just a puppet and is doing what the government wants. We respect Balasaheb Thackeray, but this airport is coming up on the land of project affected people and it has to be named after the one who fought for their rights.” Heavy police deployment Till 4 p.m., the Sion-Panvel Highway and Palm Beach Road were barricaded by over 8,000 police personnel who manned the traffic and controlled the protestors. Deputy Commissioner of Police, Traffic, Purushottam Karad, said, “Traffic was diverted on Sion Panvel Highway and protesters were prevented from crowding the road, which was closed from 8 a.m. Heavy bandobast was deployed on Palm Beach Road and the stretch from NRI junction to Killa junction was shut. No untoward incidents were reported.” The protesters went ahead with the agitation even though the police had denied them permission and a curfew was imposed in the city. “It was D.B. Patil’s death anniversary and hence we had decided to carry out the protest on June 24. Now, we are giving time to the government, but only till August 15. If the government does not name the airport after D.B. Patil. then the sons of the soil will not allow any work to take place at the airport site,” Prashant Thakur, an MLA from Panvel, said.  We respect Bal Thackeray, but this airport is coming up on the land of project affected people and it has to be named after the one who fought for their rights Dashrath Patil President, All Party Action Committee||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/thousands-protest-over-naming-of-airport/article34959517.ece
25 June 2021||Mumbai,||Unlock without compromising safety: CM||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday asked District Collectors not to be hasty in lifting COVID-19 restrictions in their respective areas and take adequate steps to unlock only after conducting a detailed study of the situation. “We have yet not come out of the second wave of the pandemic and the third wave may hit us all soon. Even though we have given rights to the local administration to decide on unlocking, any decision should be taken without compromising safety,” Mr. Thackeray said in a meeting with the District Collectors of Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur and Hingoli. These seven districts continue to record higher test positivity rates and spikes in COVID-19 cases. Referring to the five levels of unlocking set by the State government, Mr. Thackeray said if people were going to use these levels as an excuse to go out and crowd market places, it would lead to an increase in the number of infections. “Do not rush to unlock. We have taken a hard hit in the second wave, especially due to the shortage of oxygen. Do make the necessary arrangements as well as medical equipment in urban and rural areas,” the Chief Minister said. State Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte said the seven districts could turn out to be a reason for worry for the entire State, and it was important to increase the number of COVID-19 tests and improve contact tracing. Raising oxygen supply Later in the day, Mr. Thackeray held a meeting with the representatives of medical oxygen production companies, setting a target to produce 3,000 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen every day. “Presently, we produce 1,300 MT oxygen and that has to be increased to 3,000 MT. Similarly, efforts need to be taken to enhance storage capacity. Steps have to be taken to ensure that oxygen is delivered to remote areas in the State as well,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/unlock-without-compromising-safety-cm/article34959519.ece
25 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC refuses to intervene in Class 11 exams||The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to intervene in a petition filed by students to cancel the Class 11 examinations in Kerala due to the COVID-19 pandemic and evaluate marks via an internal assessment scheme. A Bench of Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari gave the students the liberty to approach the Kerala High Court with their plea. Advocate G. Prakash, for Kerala, said Class 11 examinations were scheduled in September. Class 11 marks were not relevant for college admissions in 2021. These marks would only be considered in 2022 when they are combined with the Class 12 marks. Mr. Prakash said Kerala had already conducted the Class 12 examinations in April. Advocate Prashant Padmanabhan, appearing for the students, said holding Class 11 examinations later in the year, September as planned or later depending on the COVID-19 situation, would put students under unnecessary pressure. The court said the aggrieved Class 11 students were “free to file substantive writ petition before the High Court raising all contentions available to them. The same are kept open. The High Court may decide the grievance on its own merits.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-refuses-to-intervene-in-class-11-exams/article34959384.ece
25 June 2021||Kochi,||ED moves HC against judicial probe into bid to implicate CM||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday moved the High Court against the Kerala government’s decision to establish a judicial commission of inquiry to examine the alleged attempt on the part of the agency to implicate Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the diplomatic baggage gold smuggling case. The ED’s contention has set the stage for a legal wrangle between the Centre and State over the jurisdictional boundary in a federal set-up. The litigation has political overtones. Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh had said the bid to investigate a Central agency would weaken the federal structure. Mr. Singh had pointed out that Mr. Vijayan had sought a Central investigation into the crime in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In an explanatory note issued in May, the government had said the Customs and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had discarded professionalism and pursued a path of political partisanship to ensnare the Chief Minister in criminal cases. The officers had strayed from their original purpose of finding the source of the contraband gold, its intended recipients and those who facilitated and profited from the racket. Instead, it had coerced the accused to implicate Mr. Vijayan in the case falsely, the note said. ‘Overstepping limits’ The ED contended that the State government had overstepped its jurisdiction. It portrayed the commission as an attempt to stifle the ongoing investigation against those who had abetted the money-laundering aspect of the crime that primarily involved smuggling gold via the diplomatic channel of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram during the 2019-20 period. The ED pointed out that the former Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister was the fifth accused in the case. Earlier in April, the High Court had quashed two FIRs registered by the State police against ED officials on the charge of coercing the accused to give false statements against the Chief Minister and his office. An ED official said money laundering was a Union subject. Hence, the State government had overstepped its constitutional bounds by instituting a judicial probe against the ED. A State official said the terms of reference of the commissioner of enquiry did not cover the money laundering offence. It only looked into the conspiracy to implicate Chief Minister in the case. Law and order was a State subject, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ed-moves-hc-against-judicial-probe-into-bid-to-implicate-cm/article34959386.ece

25 June 2021||CHENNAI,||Mekedatu issue may figure at CWMA meet||The Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA)’s meeting, slated for Friday (June 25), is taking place coincidentally on the day the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal (CWDT) delivered its interim award 30 years ago. The interim award had larger significance than being a mere response to Tamil Nadu’s request for immediate relief then. For the first time in the country, a river water disputes tribunal gave an interim award which was, in turn, facilitated by a verdict of the Supreme Court. But, there prevailed a period of tension for about six months between the two major riparian States of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Since June 1991, Tamil Nadu realised, in 19 out of 30 water years, more than its share of water as stipulated by the tribunal and later, the Supreme Court. On an average, annually, the State received about 260 thousand million cubic feet (tmc ft). Its share was determined as 205 tmc ft in the interim award; 192 tmc ft in the final award (2007) and 177.25 tmc ft by the Supreme Court (2018). Since 2013, the Billigindulu gauging station of the Central Water Commission replaced the Mettur dam as the reference point for measuring water realisation by Tamil Nadu. Of the quantity realised every year, a little less than 150 tmc ft came during June-September (southwest monsoon). However, this was skewed by poor receipts in the first two months of water year (June and July). In all the 30 years, only on seven occasions in June and on eight in July, Tamil Nadu got more than the stipulated quantum of water. This had prompted the State to lodge its protest several times about the efficacy of the implementation mechanism. There was not much change in the situation in the last three years after the constitution of the authority. (Only July 2018 was an exception to this norm). Yet, Tamil Nadu did not complain much as the inflow in the subsequent months – August and September – was bountiful. This year, till June 22, Tamil Nadu recorded about three tmc ft against its due of 6.7 tmc ft. Out of 30 years, the receipts were higher in 18 years in August and in 15 years in September than the prescribed quantum of water. Today’s meeting is expected to discuss issues of immediate concern and discuss the rainfall pattern of the southwest monsoon in the last one month and the outlook for the coming weeks, Tamil Nadu is prepared to give a fitting reply if Karnataka raises the Mekedatu project issue.

Hearing a PIL over the woman’s death, a Bench of Justices M.S. Ramachandra Rao and T. Vinod Kumar instructed the Judicial First Class Magistrate of Aler to inquire into Mariamma’s ‘custodial death’. The Bench said the magistrate, if necessary, should secure the woman’s body which was handed over to her family members and get a second autopsy performed. This can be done under sub-section (1) of Section 174 of Criminal Procedure Code. The second post-mortem examination should be done as early as possible, the Bench said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-orders-judicial-probe-into-custodial-death/article34959354.ece
25 June 2021||CHENNAI,||Revoke consent to operate to HUL Kodaikanal factory, say activists||The State Department for Environment and Climate Change should direct the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) to revoke the consent to operate (CTO) given to Hindustan Unilever for non-compliance with the order of the National Green Tribunal and operating Kodaikanal thermometer factory without valid Hazardous Waste Authorisation, say environmental activists. In a letter to V. Meyyanathan, Minister for Environment, Climate Change and Youth Welfare and Sports Development, Nityanand Jayaraman of Chennai Solidarity Group and Navroz Mody, member of Local Area Environment Committee, Kodaikanal, requested the government to commission an extensive site assessment and ecological risk assessment study. In the letter, they said the company was engaged in unauthorised decontamination of mercury-contaminated soil at its factory site. “The operations are... in violation of the order of the NGT. In the interest of a full-and-final cleanup, it is essential to ensure full compliance with the NGT’s orders and to satisfy oneself that the quality of the operations protect the interests of the State. Unsupervised, unauthorised and unscientific intervention will leave Tamil Nadu saddled with a legacy contaminated site like Bhopal,” they said. HUL, however, said soil remediation was being carried out with permission from the NGT and the Supreme Court. All activities were being carried out as per guidelines, applicable standards and permissions issued by the NGT, TNPCB and the CPCB. The activists said HUL had been operating the plant since August 2020 without valid Hazardous Waste Authorisation. Even two years after the [NGT] order, a detailed site assessment and ecological risk assessment — which should not take more than two months — had not yet been done, they said. The company said the study got delayed due to the lockdown. “ The claim that the study could be completed in less than two months is incorrect,” HUL said. “Excavated soil with high mercury concentration has reportedly been stored in the open... If this is the case, mercury is being made available for release into Pambar Shola and Kodaikanal Wildlife Sanctuary,” the activists said, adding the case of Sterlite was being repeated here. HUL said utmost care was being taken to prevent any release of soil outside the factory boundary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/revoke-consent-to-operate-to-hul-kodaikanal-factory-say-activists/article34959484.ece
25 June 2021||GUWAHATI,||In Meghalaya, outrage over felling of heritage pine trees||The felling of several iconic pine trees for widening a road in Meghalaya capital Shillong has triggered outrage, forcing the State government to intervene. Most of these coniferous trees, among the hill town’s USPs, were more than 100 years old. Green activists said the National Highway Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) took advantage of the COVID-19 lockdown to chop the pine trees locals were attached to. But the government swung into action on June 23 after photos and videos of the logs lying beside the road from the town’s Rilbong Bridge to Upper Shillong went viral. This stretch of the road is part of the 71 km Shillong-Dawki four-lane project estimated to cost Rs. 1,251 crore. Dawki is a trade point on the border with Bangladesh. Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma asked the NHIDC to immediately stop felling the trees until the government found a better solution. His instruction coincided with an observation of the National Green Tribunal on a Goa bypass that the construction of a road may be a necessity but should not result in the destruction of biodiversity. The Meghalaya Forest Department said it had received orders to cut down 4,447 trees for the road widening project after it was cleared by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The State’s Forest Minister, James Sangma, said the trees on one side of the road were felled as it was “totally unavoidable”. He also said the right of way for the project had been reduced from the standard 45-60 metres to 24 metres in order to minimise the damage. Forest officials said 10 trees would be planted for each tree felled. But locals said this would hardly make a difference as the site chosen for compensatory afforestation is in another district. “We would like to know if the government followed the Indian Forest Act, Biodiversity Act and the Meghalaya Forest Regulation Act before the trees were hewn. Who gave the land for the project and who is funding the destruction? activist Agnes Kharshiing, president of Civil Society Women Organisation said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/in-meghalaya-outrage-over-felling-of-heritage-pine-trees/article34959444.ece

A Bench of Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari refused to entertain a plea for a “uniform scheme” of assessment to be made applicable across Boards in the country. The court said each Board, whether the CBSE, ICSE or State Boards, was “autonomous and independent”. They could formulate their own schemes after consultation with experts. However, the Bench clarified that allowing Boards to form their own independent schemes did not preclude the court from judicially reviewing their correctness and validity when an occasion arose. By directing the State Boards to declare their results before July 31, the court ensured that students across the country get a level playing field in college admissions and other opportunities for higher studies. Earlier, the CBSE and the ICSE had agreed in the Supreme Court to announce the internal assessment results of their Class 12 students by July 31.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/notify-class-12-assessment-plan-state-boards-told/article34959134.ece

Ms. Rekha, a two-time councillor from Chalavadipalya, was at her office supervising the distribution of relief material when she reportedly received a call asking her to step out. “This was an act of vengeance. The assailants called her out of the office and attacked her with a weapon multiple times following which she sustained serious injuries on her throat, neck, head, and shoulder. She tried to escape into a small lane, but the duo attacked her again and fled from the scene when she collapsed,” said a senior police official. She was rushed to Kempe Gowda Institute of Medical Sciences where she was declared dead at 11 a.m. According to police officials, this was a planned attack, as the accused were aware of her routine. “We found that the CCTV cameras outside the office were turned away.

25 June 2021||CHENNAI,||Don’t paint entire police force as barbaric because of one aberration: Madras HC||The Madras High Court on Thursday empathised with the family of a farmer who was beaten to death by a special sub-inspector of police in Salem on Tuesday. It, however, said the incident could not be used to paint the entire police force as brutal and barbaric. When the second Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and T.V. Thamilselvi commenced their proceedings for the day, advocate R. Krishnamoorthy sought permission to make a mention and cited the death of the farmer after the latter quarrelled with the police under the influence of alcohol. When the senior judge in the Bench pointed out that the government appeared to have paid solatium to the family, the advocate, facing suo motu contempt of court proceedings for accusing Justice M. Dhandapani of being biased in favour of the police in another case booked against a woman lawyer, said the police “atrocities” were increasing day by day. Not in agreement with him, Justice Kirubakaran said: “Don't say that. The police are only discharging their duty by questioning people who violate [COVID-19] lockdown restrictions. But people consider themselves to be powerful than the police and the government and enter into wordy duel with the men in uniform. Most of them don't obey law.” Referring to recent videos in circulation in the social media of lawyers threatening to strip policemen of their uniform on being questioned for violating lockdown restrictions, the judge said: “It is unfortunate that you behave like this.” Pointing out that the nomenclature lawyer itself contained the word law, the judge said: “You should be the first to obey law scrupulously. You should be a role model to others,” the judge added. At the same time agreeing that the death of the farmer was certainly an unfortunate incident and such aberration should be avoided by the police, the judge said the issue would be looked into if the advocate files an appropriate petition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/dont-paint-entire-police-force-as-barbaric-because-of-one-aberration-madras-hc/article34959242.ece

25 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Monsoon to be weak till July||The monsoon rainfall,40% above normal from June 1 to 18, has reduced to a trickle over the previous week. The latest update from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) computes the monthly rainfall until June 24 to be just 26% of the normal and there is unlikely to be a significant boost until the first week of July. As of Thursday, India had received 152 mm of rainfall as against the normal 121.2 mm. On Tuesday, the IMD said India is in the grip of a “weak monsoon spell.” The southwest monsoon has so far covered most parts of the country except parts of the northwest — Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab. Unusually, for this period, the monsoon has progressed to eastern, central and adjoining northwest India earlier than normal by seven to 10 days. However, further progress over the remaining parts of country is unlikely for the last week of June, the IMD noted. All the broad subdivisions have posted above normal rainfall so far. East and northeast India has posted 8% extra, northwest India 58%, central India 46% and the southern Peninsula 15%, according to data as of June 23. Rainfall activity is likely to increase over most parts of the country after the first week of July especially in peninsular and central India, which is also part of India’s core agricultural zone dependent on the monsoon for irrigation. “Fairly widespread to widespread rainfall with isolated heavy falls is also likely over most parts of northeast and adjoining east India during most days of the week [July 1-7],” the agency said based on weather models that assess the development of the monsoon system over the fortnight. The India Meteorological Department (IMD), on June 1, said it expects more rain in the monsoon months from June to September than its previous estimate in April. The monsoon rainfall was likely to be 101% of the Long Period Average (LPA) of 88 cm. On April 16, it said the monsoon rainfall would be 98% of the LPA. In the agency's parlance, this still constitutes ‘normal’ rainfall which is anywhere from 96-104% of the LPA.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/monsoon-to-be-weak-till-july/article34959062.ece
25 June 2021||New Delhi,||Cong. raises 5 demands on J&K||Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, who led the party’s delegation at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting on J&K on Thursday, said the party had placed five demands, including restoration of full Statehood, holding early elections, and the return of Kashmiri Pandits, but did not demand the restoration of Article 370. Mr. Azad told mediapersons after the meeting that in the new Bill for Statehood, the government should protect land rights through new domicile rules and guarantee employment for locals. The other demand by the Congress delegation, which included J&K Pradesh Congress Committee chief Ghulam Ahmad Mir and former Deputy Chief Minister Tara Chand, was the release of political detainees at the earliest. “In today’s meeting, from Congress’s side, we informed the Prime Minister why the State should not have been dissolved. The move was done without consulting elected representatives. But in the end, after saying all this, we have put up five big demands in front of the government. Statehood should be restored at the earliest was our first demand,” Mr. Azad said. “The Home Minister as well as the Prime Minister had assured on the floor of Parliament that Statehood would be restored [to J&K] at some point. There is peace now, ceasefire is also there and the borders are also quiet. There can’t be a better time to grant Statehood,” he added. “We had historic domicile rules and also rules regarding employment. The government should give a guarantee that they will bring Bills on land and employment [for J&K],” Mr. Azad said. Though the Congress did not directly refer to the restoration of the special provisions under Article 370, party leaders claimed that its demand for special land rights and job guarantees for locals would “have the same effect”. Specifically asked about the party’s position on Article 370, Mr. Azad said the matter was sub-judice. “For now, we will not talk about this. The people of J&K are in distress since the August 5, 2019 decision ...” Mr. Mir added. Recently, former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram talked about status quo ante by repealing the “offending laws” in the forthcoming monsoon session of Parliament.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-raises-5-demands-on-jk/article34959086.ece
25 June 2021||Chennai,||U.P. leads in number of shots given on Thursday||India administered 59.1 lakh (5.91 million) doses of COVID-19 vaccines until 9 p.m. on Thursday. Uttar Pradesh recorded the highest number of vaccinations (8.2 lakh) followed by Madhya Pradesh (7.3 lakh) and Gujarat (4.3 lakh). Between June 1 and 23, 37.2 lakh doses were administered daily in India on average. At the current rate, a total of 100.3 crore doses can be administered by December 31, 2021, which is around 87.7 crore doses fewer than those required to fully vaccinate all adults (188 crore doses). To fully inoculate all adults by the end of this year, 82.2 lakh doses need to be given daily on average in the country.

25 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Central Vista work on schedule’||Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Puri on Thursday said the work on the redevelopment of the Central Vista Avenue and construction of the new Parliament building was “on schedule”. After visiting the sites, Mr. Puri said in a series of tweets that the projects were progressing swiftly. “Delighted to interact with the workers giving shape to our future heritage. They come from different parts of the country. Pity that the Congress ecosystem wanted to snatch away the livelihood of these hardworking women & men. I thanked them for their sweat & toil,” he said in a tweet. In another tweet, he said, in an apparent reference to critics of the projects, “… Happy to inform the ‘Vidvaans’ that their ice cream evenings are going to get even better!” He added that the new look of the Central Vista Avenue was a “judicious mix of modern with traditional” and would “redefine the heart of the city”. The Minister also shared photos of the Jamun trees at the India Gate lawns and said the trees were standing tall as opposed to the rumours of them being uprooted. While the new Parliament building is scheduled to be completed in time for the winter session in 2022, the 75th year of Independence, the revamped Central Vista Avenue is expected to be ready for the Republic Day parade in 2022.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/central-vista-work-on-schedule/article34959054.ece
25 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Four students arrested in Israel Embassy blast case||The Delhi Police Special Cell has arrested four students from Ladakh in connection with the Israel Embassy blast case, the police said on Thursday. They were arrested from Kargil and taken to Delhi on transit remand, they said. The four students were identified as Nazir Hussain (26), Zulfikar Ali Wazir (25), Aiaz Hussain (28) and Muzammil Hussain (25). All of them are residents of Thang village in Kargil, Ladakh. The minor improvised explosive device (IED) blast took place outside the Embassy of Israel in Lutyens’ Delhi on January 29. There were no casualties. In an official statement, Delhi Police PRO Chinmoy Biswal said the Special Cell, in a joint operation with a Central intelligence agency and the Kargil police, detained the four from Kargil in connection with a conspiracy to execute terror activities in the national capital. A team from the Intelligence Bureau (IB) has reached the office of the Special Cell to question them. An investigation was underway to ascertain their role in the incident. “It was found that all four stayed at a rented accommodation near Delhi University area. On the day of the blast, their mobile phones were switched off. After a few days, they vacated the accommodation all of sudden and moved to Ladakh. We are finding out other locations where they stayed in Delhi,” said a police officer. Delhi Police’s Special Cell, probing the incident, registered a case of “conspiracy”. The Ministry of Home Affairs handed over the probe to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on February 2.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/four-students-arrested-in-israel-embassy-blast-case/article34959068.ece
25 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Army issues tender for 1,750 FICVs||The Army has issued a tender, or a Request For Information (RFI), for the procurement of 1,750 Futuristic Infantry Combat Vehicles (FICVs) to replace the Russian-origin infantry vehicles in service. Early this month, an RFI was also issued for the procurement of 1,770 Future Ready Combat Vehicles (FRCV) for the procurement of the next generation Main Battle Tank, with a planned induction from 2030. “The Ministry of Defence intends to procure an approximate 1,750 quantities of Futuristic Infantry Combat Vehicles (Tracked) in three versions,” the RFI published on Thursday said. Approximately, 55% of them should be gun version, 20% command version and 25% command and surveillance version. Within a week Vendors have been asked to express willingness within a week. “A three-stage induction model has been proposed by the Army and Indian vendors can collaborate with Foreign Original Equipment Manufacturers [OEMs] to supply FICVs within two years of the contract at the rate of 75-100 vehicles per year,” an officer said. This is the Army’s third attempt for the procurement of a new infantry vehicle. According to the RFI, the FICVs would be employed for cross-country operations, including amphibious operations in plain and desert terrain along the Western borders and high altitudes, up to 5,000 m, and mountain terrain along the northern borders in eastern Ladakh, the central sector and north Sikkim. They would replace the 1980s vintage Russian-origin BMP-2,  the officer said. Based on the responses to the RFI, the Army would finalise the specifications and also decide the procurement category. The main operational tasks that would have to performed by the FICV include destroying enemy tanks, armoured personnel carriers, combat vehicles, low-flying helicopters and other ground-based weapon platforms and positions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/army-issues-tender-for-1750-ficvs/article34959072.ece
25 June 2021||Ghaziabad,||RLD chief urges PM to end impasse on farm laws||In a fervent appeal to the Prime Minister to end the deadlock on the farm laws, Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) president Jayant Chaudhary said on Thursday that “policy measures can be termed as reforms only if they satisfy the larger social good”.  “It pains the nation that even after your statement, the government appears to have further withdrawn from engaging with the farmer organisations even as the farmers are waiting at Delhi’s borders,” Mr. Chaudhary said in a letter to the Prime Minister, written on the eve of the completion of six months of farmers’ protests against the farm laws. Referring to the Agriculture Minister’s statements suggesting that a rollback of laws was not possible, Mr. Chaudhary said he could understand that there was a fear in government circles that backtracking on these laws could become a precedent. “However, in the face of public sentiment, a sensitive government would not shy away from taking a step back in order to move forward.”  “It is not clear to the farmers how these laws improve their market position or pricing power,” he said.  He contended that the farmers’ agitation had a negative economic impact, but the failure to resolve the key issues had also hurt the pride of the nation’s agriculturists.  Meanwhile, Bharatiya Kisan Union spokesperson Rakesh Tikait said on Thursday that “the farmers would find their remedy in Parliament and the government would be treated in villages”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rld-chief-urges-pm-to-end-impasse-on-farm-laws/article34959075.ece
25 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||In contact with stakeholders on Afghanistan, says India||India on Thursday said it was in contact with “various stakeholders” in and around Afghanistan, confirming that South Block has adopted a broad-based approach to discuss the future of Afghanistan and the region around with various parties involved. The response came after National Security Adviser Ajit Doval addressed a meeting of his counterparts of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) held on Thursday in Dushanbe. “India supports all peace initiatives and has a long-term commitment towards development and reconstruction of Afghanistan. In this context, we remain in touch with various stakeholders, including regional countries,” said Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi. The comment has added more substance to the reports that India has held a round of secret talks with the members of the Taliban in Doha. Arguing in favour of stronger ties with Kabul, Mr. Bagchi said India has brought development to Afghanistan which was ravaged by violence inflicted by cross-border actors. “India has brought electricity, dams, schools, health clinics, roads and community projects to Afghanistan. The world knows what Pakistan has brought to Afghanistan.” The comments on dialogue with relevant stakeholders has also added to the officially unconfirmed reports of backchannel talks that India has been conducting with Pakistan through third parties. Mr. Doval attended the SCO NSAs meeting, which also saw the participation of his Pakistani counterpart Moeed Yusuf, who has been in the news over reports of backchannel talks. Sources said Mr. Doval argued for the “need to preserve gains made in the last two decades in Afghanistan and give top priority to the welfare of its people”. He also proposed an action plan against Pakistan-based terror outfits Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) as part of the anti-terror framework of the SCO and sought adoption of international standards to counter terror financing, including an MoU between the SCO and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Cross-border attacks against India by LeT and JeM have been at the centre of recent tensions with Pakistan. The issue was being discussed at the FATF on Thursday and a decision on greylisting of Pakistan is expected as early as Friday. Mr. Doval also called for monitoring of new technologies used by terrorists, such as drones, dark web, Artificial Intelligence, blockchain and social media.

25 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Full licence for Covaxin may take time||Bharat Biotech, the manufacturer of Covaxin, may not be given full licensure for its COVID vaccine just yet, said a senior health official, saying the vaccine will continue to be used under emergency authorisation. While the company refused to comment on the latest development, Union Health Ministry officials said the authorities have sought more data from follow up studies. The company earlier this week had submitted data from Phase 3 trials to the subject expert committee (SEC) of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO). The yet-to-be published data submitted showed that Covaxin had demonstrated a 77.8% efficacy in its Phase 3 trial, which was conducted on 25,800 subjects. “The proposal seeking full licensure for Covaxin, was looked into and we have sought more details. Till then Covaxin will continue to be available to public under the earlier emergency authorisation,” an official said. Meanwhile, the Health Ministry on Thursday denied allegations of non-transparent allocation of COVID-19 vaccines to States. Allocation of doses The Central government continues to allocate COVID-19 vaccines to States and Union Territories in a transparent manner, it said, adding that distribution of vaccines is based on population of a State, caseload or disease burden and the State’s utilisation efficiency. The Ministry noted that allocation is negatively affected by vaccine wastage. “India’s national COVID vaccination programme is built on scientific and epidemiological evidence, WHO guidelines and global best practices. Anchored in systematic end-to-end planning, it is implemented through effective and efficient participation of States and Union Territories and the people at large,” said the Ministry. It noted that information about the vaccine supply by Central Government, consumption by the States and Union Territories, unutilised vaccine doses available with them, along with vaccine-supply in the pipeline, is regularly shared in the public domain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/full-licence-for-covaxin-may-take-time/article34959088.ece
25 June 2021||Kolkata,||Calcutta HC reserves order on Mamata’s recusal petition||The Calcutta High Court on Thursday reserved its order on a recusal application filed by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee urging that the election petition filed in the Nandigram results be assigned to another Bench. Ms. Banerjee virtually participated in the hearing. Senior advocate A.M. Singhvi, who appeared for the Chief Minister, sought recusal of Justice Kausik Chanda on grounds of his association with the BJP as a lawyer. Reading from the recusal application, Dr. Singhvi said posts on various social media platforms suggested that Justice Chanda had a “close, pecuniary, personal, professional and ideological relationship with the BJP” and “close relationship with prominent leaders such as Dilip Ghosh and Tathagata Roy”. Justice Chanda asked why the recusal petition had not been presented on June 18, when the matter was brought before him for hearing. During the hearing, there had been cordial discussions between the parties, and Justice Chanda observed that when he had first appeared for the BJP as a lawyer, he had not known the full name of the party. Dr. Singhvi remarked that since then, the BJP has made large strides in West Bengal. He added that the judge would only be elevating his stature by recusing himself from hearing the petition. Dr. Singhvi pointed out that two judges of the Supreme Court had recused themselves from hearing matters related to West Bengal. Justice Chanda said while Dr. Singhvi was associated with the Congress, other counsel having links to the BJP were appearing for the Trinamool in the case. He also asked if he would not be giving in to a media trial if he recused himself. He added that he would think it over and reserved the judgment. Earlier this month, Ms. Banerjee had filed a petition alleging irregularities in the counting exercise of the Nandigram Assembly results.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/calcutta-hc-reserves-order-on-mamatas-recusal-petition/article34959079.ece
25 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Monuments see poor footfall in the first week of reopening||Some of the major Centrally protected monuments that reopened on June 16 after a closure due to the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic saw only about 1% to 7% of their average pre-pandemic daily footfall in the first eight days of the reopening, according to Archaeological Survey of India data. The Union Culture Ministry on June 14 ordered that all monuments under the ASI be opened to the public from June 16, subject to local administration rules, including State-wise weekend lockdown orders. The monuments, sites and museums of the ASI had been closed since April 15. From June 16 to Wednesday, Taj Mahal in Agra was open for five days due to the weekend lockdown in Uttar Pradesh. The daily footfall ranged from 2,128 on June 16 to 4,322 on Monday, according to ASI data accessed by The Hindu . In February 2020, before the pandemic, the UNESCO World Heritage Site used to receive 16,000 to 17,000 visitors on an average, with the numbers increasing on weekends and holidays, said an ASI official. Cap on tickets While tickets are sold only online to maintain crowd control and social distancing, the number of visitors at Taj Mahal was not limited, according to the official. In Delhi, however, tickets at each monument were capped between 7,000 and 10,000 a day. In Delhi, popular tourist destinations such as Humayun’s Tomb, Qutub Minar and Red Fort saw a few hundred visitors a day on an average, down from the thousands of visitors seen earlier. On average, Humayun’s Tomb had 631 daily visitors from June 16 to Wednesday, with June 20, a Sunday, seeing a spike with 1,770 visitors. The official said Humayun’s Tomb used to receive 7,000 to 8,000 visitors a day on average before the pandemic. Similarly, Qutub Minar had an average of 743 daily visitors, ranging from 432 on June 16 to 1,677 on June 20, which was around 7% of the 9,000 to 10,000 visitors on an average pre-COVID-19. Red Fort, which remains closed on Mondays, had an average of 152 daily visitors over seven days, around 1%-2% of its 7,000 to 9,000 daily visitors prior to the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/monuments-see-poor-footfall-in-the-first-week-of-reopening/article34959094.ece
25 June 2021||GUWAHATI,||Jab status linked to resuming of businesses in northeast||The COVID-19 vaccination status has been linked to the opening of shops and business establishments, operation of commercial passenger vehicles as well as the salaries of some government employees in the northeastern region. Besides, these are incentives such as free rice and cash offered by some local authorities to counter the reluctance or resistance to inoculation by people, many of whom believe that the vaccine induces infertility and genetic changes. On June 23, the High Court of Meghalaya directed all shops, commercial establishments, taxi, auto-rickshaw and bus operators to display the vaccination status of their staff. This followed the hearing of a petition challenging the orders of the State’s Deputy Commissioners asking shopkeepers, vendors, local cabbies and others to get vaccinated before they resume their business. The Bench of Chief Justice Biswanath Somadder and Justice H.S. Thangkhiew observed that the orders of the district heads should be seen as a “persuasive advisory” and not coercion. The court, however, pointed out that forced vaccination violates the fundamental rights of the people concerned while advising all shops, commercial centres and public commercial vehicles should prominently display the words “vaccinated” or “not vaccinated” to let their customers or passengers know about their status. “In the event, any shops/establishments/local taxis /auto-rickshaws/maxi cabs and buses flout the above directions, the authority concerned of the State shall immediately direct its closure/stoppage of plying,” the court ordered. The court, fixing June 30 as the next date of hearing, also said the authorities should immediately step in and proceed in accordance with the law if there was any attempt made by any person or organisation to spread misinformation regarding the efficacy of vaccines among the people of the State. The Assam government has directed all the departmental heads to ascertain the vaccination status of their frontline employees before releasing their monthly salaries. Chief Secretary Jishnu Barua, also the chairperson of the State Disaster Management Authority, Assam (ASDMA), issued the order after officials found out that many frontline government employees had not taken their COVID-19 vaccine shots. “Non-vaccination of such frontline government servants may give rise to the possibility of further spread of the virus, which in turn may endanger the lives of common citizens, especially the vulnerable groups like children, pregnant women, etc.,” the order said. “Direct all department heads to ascertain the vaccination status of such government servants before releasing the monthly salary/remuneration from the current month (June) onwards,” it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jab-status-linked-to-resuming-of-businesses-in-northeast/article34959097.ece
25 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Congress to combat vaccine hesitancy||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Thursday asked party colleagues to play an active role in ensuring vaccination coverage of 75% of India’s population by the year end and also address the issue of hesitancy with regard to COVID-19 vaccines. Following a virtual meeting of the general secretaries and All India Congress Committee (AICC) members in charge of various States with Ms. Gandhi, the party has decided to step up its COVID-19 outreach programme by visiting over 3 crore households across 736 districts in a span of 30 days. From July 1 to 17, the Congress will also hold protests against rising prices of petrol and diesel as well as food items by taking out protest marches, cycle yatras and signature campaign at petorl pumps, general secretary (organisation) K.C. Venugopal said. Addressing the AICC office-bearers, Ms. Gandhi said experts had pointed to the possibility of a third wave in a few months and the vulnerability of the children in such a scenario. “The second wave these past four months has been devastating for lakhs and lakhs of families all over the country. We must learn from this traumatic experience so that we do not have to experience it yet again,” Ms. Gandhi said. The Congress chief urged party leaders to disseminate the party’s white paper (released on June 22) that not only details the “failure” of the Narendra Modi government in handling the pandemic but also offers suggestions in aggressively vaccinating the majority of the adult population in the shortest possible time. Ms. Gandhi also talked about the ‘intolerable’ burden placed on the people because of the rising fuel prices and the skyrocketing prices of essential commodities like pulses and edible oils.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-to-combat-vaccine-hesitancy/article34959099.ece
25 June 2021||kollam,||Kerala women’s panel chief’s ‘you suffer’ remark draws flak||Kerala Women’s Commission chairperson M.C. Josephine has courted controversy for asking a domestic violence victim to “suffer” as she has not filed a police complaint. The video clip of a seemingly annoyed Ms. Josephine snapping at a victim created much resentment, with many demanding her resignation. Her rude remark to a distressed woman, who seemed a little hesitant to open up, also generated a volley of trolls on social media. When the woman said she was being abused by her husband and her mother-in-law, the chairperson asked if she had approached the police. The Ernakulam resident revealed she had not shared it with anyone and Ms. Josephine retorted with a curt “then you suffer”. Many prominent persons, including politicians, pointed out her behaviour as arrogant and demanded a more humane person as her replacement. Ms. Josephine, in her statement, said that her hard tone was due to the issues in audio quality and she had only taken a mother’s freedom with the woman. “It was my self-indignation over girls failing to come forward bravely with complaints, but on second thoughts I felt I could have avoided that comment. If my words have hurt her, I express regret,” she said. She further explained that she was totally clueless about the format of the programme. “I had tried to avoid that programme due to my busy schedule and health issues. I decided to go when they told me my response was necessary and the subject was dowry-related. Only after reaching there, I came to know that it was a call-in programme,” Ms. Josephine said. Cong. seeks her removal In Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president K. Sudhakaran slammed Ms. Josephine for slighting a victim of domestic violence. He said the woman had called Ms. Josephine as a last resort. However, the chairperson had slighted her. Mr. Sudhakaran demanded that Ms. Josephine resign. He said the government’s women helpline would offer no solace to victims, if Ms. Josephine’s public reaction were any indication. He said women were generally reluctant to stand in front of police stations for long hours to register their complaints.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-womens-panel-chiefs-you-suffer-remark-draws-flak/article34959451.ece
25 June 2021||GUWAHATI,||Outrage over felling of heritage pine trees for road in Meghalaya||The felling of several iconic pine trees for widening a road in Meghalaya capital Shillong has triggered outrage, forcing the State government to intervene. Most of these coniferous trees, among the hill town’s USPs, were more than 100 years old. Green activists said the National Highway Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) took advantage of the COVID-19 lockdown to chop the pine trees locals were attached to. But the government swung into action on June 23 after photos and videos of the logs lying beside the road from the town’s Rilbong Bridge to Upper Shillong went viral. This stretch of the road is part of the 71 km Shillong-Dawki four-lane project estimated to cost Rs. 1,251 crore. Dawki is a trade point on the border with Bangladesh. Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma asked the NHIDC to immediately stop felling the trees until the government finds a better solution. His instruction coincided with an observation of the National Green Tribunal on a Goa bypass that construction of a road may be a necessity but should not result in the destruction of biodiversity. Cleared by Centre A Meghalaya Forest Department official said it had received orders to cut down 4,447 trees for the road widening project after it was cleared by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The State’s Forest Minister, James Sangma said the trees on one side of the road were felled as it was “totally unavoidable”. He also said the right of way for the project had been reduced from the standard 45-60 metres to 24 metres in order to minimise the damage. Forest officials said 10 trees would be planted in lieu of each tree felled. But locals said this would hardly make a difference as the site chosen for compensatory afforestation is in another district. “We would like to know if the government followed Indian Forest Act, Biodiversity Act and Meghalaya Forest Regulation Act before the trees were hewn. Who gave the land for the project and who is funding for the destruction of the trees?” said activist Agnes Kharshiing, president of Civil Society Women Organisation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/outrage-over-felling-of-heritage-pine-trees-for-road-in-meghalaya/article34959287.ece
25 June 2021||Hyderabad,||315 MVA transformer at Mamidipally gutted||In a major accident that took place in the 400 KV sub-station of TS-Transco at Mamidipally village on the outskirts of the city, near Shamshabad, late on Thursday night, a 315 MVA transformer was gutted along with adjoining transmission system equipment. The engineers of the Transco stationed at the sub-station noticed the fire immediately after it was seen on the transformer around 10 p.m. and alerted the nearby fire stations and switched it off to prevent further damage and diverted the load to other transformers in the sub-stations. The fire tenders rushed there and put off the fire before it could spread to other equipment and transformers of the sub-station. Chairman of TS-Transco D. Prabhakar Rao rushed to the spot immediately after learning about the incident along with other higher officials and engineers of the power utility. When contacted, Mr. Rao said the immediate reason for the fire assessed to be internal problem developed within the 25-year-old transformer. He stated that there would not be any impact on power supply to the City and other area linked to the sub-station as three other transformers were there to take the load. At the time of the incident, the damaged transformer was bearing about 30% of the load and immediately on noticing the fire, the control room switched the load to other sub-stations in the transmission system. Officials of the Transco stated that the loss due to fire could be about Rs. 2 crore as per the preliminary assessment and it was not known whether the damaged transformer could be repaired for use again or had to be replaced. The authorities thanked the fire services department for rushing fire tenders immediately to limit the damage due to fire mishap.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/315-mva-transformer-at-mamidipally-gutted/article34959356.ece

25 June 2021||NEW DELHi,||NCB arrests key accused in Pak.-based drug ring||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Thursday arrested an alleged key member of a Pakistan-based drug trafficking syndicate in connection with the recent seizure of over 56.5 kg of heroin by the Border Security Force (BSF). The accused has been identified as Jasbir Singh, a resident of Hoshiyarpur in Punjab. Seized in Rajasthan The BSF had seized the contraband on June 3 at Bandali Khajuvala in Rajasthan, along the Indo-Pakistan border. The next day, the force arrested two accused persons, Rupa and Harmesh Singh, in Punjab, with the help of the local police. However, prime accused Jasbir Singh and his associate, Kali, fled the spot. “Both of them are habitual offenders under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, Indian Penal Code (murder), Excise Act, Arms Act and the Jail Manual Act,” said an NCB official. They had been absconding since 2019, the official added. Suspected supplier The case was handed over to the NCB’s Jodhpur unit. The agency identified one Malik Choudhary, a resident of Lahore in Pakistan, as the suspected heroin supplier and launched a hunt for Jasbir Singh. During the course of the investigation, three more accused — Rajvinder Singh, Sukhpreet Singh and Sunil Singh, all residents of Rajasthan — were arrested for harbouring Jasbir Singh and conducting recces along the border to facilitate heroin smuggling. Based on the findings, the NCB sleuths mounted surveillance and finally arrested the prime accused in Hoshiyarpur on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ncb-arrests-key-accused-in-pak-based-drug-ring/article34959058.ece
25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||PM backs delimitation exercise in J&K||He added that “delimitation has to happen at a quick pace so that polls can happen and J&K gets an elected government that gives strength to its development trajectory.” “The biggest strength of our democracy is the ability to sit across a table and exchange views,” he said. Government sources said Prime Minister Modi thanked all the participating leaders for making it to Delhi for the meeting and asked that they “express their views frankly.” National Conference leader Omar Abdullah, in a presser after the meeting said, “We told the Prime Minister that we don’t stand with what was done on August 5, 2019. We are not ready to accept it. But we won’t take law into our hands. We’ll fight this in court. We also told the Prime Minister that there’s been a breach of trust between the state and Centre. It is the Centre’s duty to restore it.” Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said “almost 80% of parties spoke on Article 370 but the matter is sub judice.” Both Mr. Azad and Mr. Abdullah stressed on restoration of statehood and reversal of many executive and legal changes related to land rights protection and restoration of a Jammu and Kashmir cadre in bureaucracy. Ms. Mufti’s take was somewhat different, when she spoke after the meeting. “The people of Jammu and Kashmir are in a lot of difficulties after August 5, 2019. They are angry, upset and emotionally shattered. They feel humiliated. I told the Prime Minister that the people of J&K don’t accept the manner in which Article 370 was abrogated unconstitutionally, illegally and immorally,” she said. BJP leader Kavinder Gupta said that any thought of restoring Article 370 should not even be considered. “Elections will be held after the delimitation process, and an Assembly constituted once again. The process will come into effect about which people are hoping that they’ll get representation. Article 370 has been abrogated. It should not even be thought that it will ever come back,” he said. Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who was present at the meeting, said the “delimitation exercise and peaceful elections are important milestones in restoring statehood as promised in Parliament”, making it clear that Assembly polls had to be a precursor to any talk of restoring statehood. Some political parties however did stress that statehood should be restored before polls can be held. Minister of State for the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), Dr. Jitendra Singh, in an official statement after the meeting, said the next step in strengthening democracy in J&K would be swiftly completing the delimitation process so that the Assembly polls could be held, and that the Prime Minister stressed the need for “constructive engagement” of all political parties with the delimitation process. Among those who attended the meeting were four former Chief Ministers of Jammu and Kashmir — Farooq and Omar Abdullah of the National Conference, Ghulam Nabi Azad of the Congress, and Mehbooba Mufti of the PDP. People’s Conference leaders Muzzaffar Baig and Sajjad Lone also attended as did Kavinder Gupta and Ravinder Raina of the BJP and Bheem Singh of the Panthers Party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-backs-delimitation-exercise-in-jk/article34959065.ece
25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Hope this is the beginning of a process, says Omar||NC president and Gupkar alliance chief Dr. Abdullah said building the trust is very necessary and restoration of full statehood will be the first trust building exercise from New Delhi. All the constituents of the Gupkar Alliance, including Dr. Abdullah and Peoples Democratic Party’s Mehbooba Mufti reiterated their demand to restore the special status of J&K, as it existed on August 4, 2019. Ms. Mufti said she complimented the PM for initiating dialogue with China and Pakistan and insisted that India should talk to Pakistan for peace in Kashmir. “We also sought security on land, jobs and minerals of J&K and an end to any kind of intimidation. We also demanded the release of political leaders,” she added. Kashmir-based Peoples Conference (PC) and J&K Apni Party also sought special provisions on the issue of land and jobs during the meeting, while describing the meeting as “cordial and dignified”. However, these two parties did not discuss Article 370, saying “it's sub judice”. “I did suggest to the PM to incorporate 35(A) (special provision to secure jobs and land for locals) under Article 371. There was a thrust on getting together in strengthening democracy in J&K and the majority of leaders demanded restoration of statehood. The PM did suggest elections after the delimitation process is completed and also promised on the restoration of statehood. After that other issues will be taken up,” PC's Muzaffar Hussain Baigh said. J&K Apni Party chief Altaf Bukhari said the meeting is likely to herald a new dawn for J&K. “Our party's paramount demands have been restoration of Statehood, early Assembly elections, delimitation on merit and constitutional mechanism that protects the rights of residents of J&K on their land, jobs and natural resources besides expediting the hearing of the Supreme Court on Article 370 and 35-A,” Mr. Bukhari said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hope-this-is-the-beginning-of-a-process-says-omar/article34959066.ece

During the hearing, Justice Khanwilkar orally remarked that the University Grants Commission should announce a cut-off date for admissions to prompt school Boards to declare Class 12 results on time. “There should not be any cause for uncertainty,” Justice Maheshwari noted. Most States have cancelled their Class 12 exams due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Assam informed the court on Thursday that it had cancelled its Class 12 exams and the assessment scheme was under formulation. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) also submitted that it had cancelled the exams for its students. The court has been, in every hearing, advising caution to States, saying children should not be exposed to the risk of contracting the infection. “We know how the second wave started and how quickly it panned out… Everything changed in a matter of 10 days… Now we don’t know how the third wave will unfold,” Justice Khanwilkar remarked on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/notify-class-12-internal-assessment-scheme/article34959070.ece

Mr. Roy had joined the Trinamool Congress earlier this month after being associated with the BJP for over three years. The development comes at a time when the BJP has written to the Assembly Speaker seeking Mr. Roy’s disqualification as an MLA. Mr. Roy contested and won the recently concluded Assembly election from the Krishnanagar Uttar Assembly constituency. “The Speaker’s decision is final in such matters. If anyone has an issue, there can be voting in the Assembly,” the Chief Minister said. The decision to appoint Mr. Roy the PAC Chairperson will not only help accommodate the veteran politician in a key post but also prevent a BJP legislator from occupying the post. Usually, the post is reserved for a member of the Opposition parties. On Wednesday, Mr. Roy filed his nomination for the post. The BJP leadership said the development proved that the Trinamool Congress did not follow Constitutional norms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/trinamool-to-back-roy-for-pac-chairperson-post/article34959081.ece
25 June 2021||PUNE,||Rahul’s Twitter attacks not enough: Saamana||The Shiv Sena, in an editorial on Thursday in its mouthpiece, Saamana, said former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Centre only on Twitter, and failed to produce a viable Opposition. “Mr. Gandhi attacks the Centre and its policies regularly, but that is on Twitter,” it said and exhorted Mr. Gandhi to join hands with Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar to get all Opposition parties on board against the ruling BJP. The Sena, which is in alliance with the Congress and the NCP in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, chided the Congress for failing to lead the United Progressive Alliance effectively and not having a proper national president even now. The editorial said, “He [Mr. Modi] knows the situation in the country has gone out of his hands and his body language has changed... But even so, and despite the ire of the general public, the confidence of the BJP and the Central government remains undiminished as they know that they face no threat owing to a weak and disunited Opposition.” The Sena’s less-than-charitable remarks towards its allies are particularly significant in the light of the heightened tensions between the three MVA partners. The Congress’s recent pronouncements of fighting polls alone and the Sena’s alleged frustration at being dominated by the NCP have led to speculation that the saffron party will once again gravitate towards the BJP. Elaborating on the nature of the Opposition, the editorial took a wry dig at Mr. Pawar. “The tea party called the ‘Rashtra Manch’ at Sharad Pawar’s Delhi home showed the true status of the Opposition. The two-and-a-half-hour meeting yielded nothing, despite being hyped by the media.” Earlier this week, Mr. Pawar hosted a meeting of the leaders of eight Opposition parties, including the Trinamool Congress, the Samajwadi Party, the Aam Aadmi Party, the Rashtriya Lok Dal, and the Left parties at his residence in Delhi, amid heightened speculation about the possibility of a ‘third front’ against the BJP. The unlikely coalition of the Sena, the NCP and the Congress came into being in November 2019 following the Sena’s acrimonious split with its partner of three decades, the BJP, owing to a bitter wrangling over the Chief Minister’s post.  The confidence of the Centre remains undiminished as they know that they face no threat owing to a weak and disunited Opposition Saamana editorial||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rahuls-twitter-attacks-not-enough-saamana/article34959083.ece

Josephine has courted controversy for asking a domestic violence victim to “suffer” as she has not filed a police complaint. The video clip of a seemingly annoyed Ms. Josephine snapping at a victim created much resentment, with many demanding her resignation. Her rude remark to a distressed woman, who seemed a little hesitant to open up, also generated a volley of trolls on social media. When the woman said she was being abused by her husband and her mother-in-law, the chairperson asked if she had approached the police. The Ernakulam resident revealed she had not shared it with anyone and Ms. Josephine retorted with a curt “then you suffer”. Many prominent persons, including politicians, pointed out her behaviour as arrogant and demanded a more humane person as her replacement. Ms. Josephine, in her statement, said that her hard tone was due to the issues in audio quality and she had only taken a mother’s freedom with the woman. “It was my self-indignation over girls failing to come forward bravely with complaints, but on second thoughts I felt I could have avoided that comment. If my words have hurt her, I express regret,” she said. ‘Totally clueless’ She further explained that she was totally clueless about the format of the programme. “I had tried to avoid that programme due to my busy schedule and health issues. I decided to go when they told me my response was necessary and the subject was dowry-related. Only after reaching there, I came to know that it was a call-in programme,” Ms. Josephine said. In Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president K. Sudhakaran slammed Ms. Josephine for slighting a victim of domestic violence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-womens-panel-chiefs-remark-draws-flak/article34959285.ece
25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Blissful atma swaroopa||In the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Yagnyavalkya explains to Maitreyi that the self or the atma alone is very dear to each one of us, though we may think we love and care for our kith and kin, etc, and our possessions. This is because the atma swaroopa is essentially blissful and each one longs to attain this bliss. In the grantha Satasloki, Adi Sankara alludes to the human tendency to get attached to people, objects, places, etc, and shows that this attachment is the real cause of sorrow, pointed out Sri K. Ramasubramaniam in a discourse. The acharya explains with examples to show that the self is dearer than anything else to each one of us. All objects are valued because we think they give us happiness though in reality no object can give sorrow or happiness always. Thus we shift between likes and dislikes throughout our existence. If some objects cause sorrow, they are discarded. Though one may say one’s wife, son or others are dear to him, they are not really the object of his desire. For, he will not hesitate to assert his rights and views in case differences of opinion may arise. Suppose the son refuses to act according to the wishes of his father or the wife chooses to make independent decisions that are not to one’s liking, then the choice would be to reject them in preference to his own wishes. If suppose a man’s hand is badly infected and the doctor advises amputation, the person surely will agree rather than endanger his life. He would not mind losing his hand though it had served him well until then. The idea is that all these are dear to a person only because he thinks he derives happiness from them. Ultimately it is one’s own self that is the real object of love and not others. Everything is dear only for one’s own sake.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/blissful-atma-swaroopa/article34959089.ece

25 June 2021||Mumbai,||Maharashtra Congress chief called to Delhi||While touring north Maharashtra to take stock of his party’s growth in the region, Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole was abruptly called to Delhi, giving rise to yet another round of speculation on the already shaky political ground of the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance in Maharashtra. However, the Congress said Mr. Patole’s visit to Delhi was for organisational reasons. “It’s likely that we will be electing an Assembly Speaker in the upcoming monsoon session. The leaders in Delhi needed to speak about this. At the same time, several BJP MLAs want to join the Congress. That issue also needs to be discussed,” said Mr. Patole, when asked about his trip to Delhi, due on Friday. He said he would be meeting former Congress president Rahul Gandhi. Mr. Patole dismissed the attempt to link his meeting with causing instability in the MVA alliance. “I am the president of the Maharashtra Congress and will naturally think about making my party stronger. But that does not mean I have problems with the other parties in the Maha Vikas Aghadi. Those who think that this government will fall should stop daydreaming. We will work for five years,” he said. Two days ago, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar held a meeting with the leaders of eight Opposition parties, resulting in speculation about a ‘third front’ against the BJP.

The remaining 2,334 eligible beneficiaries have been vaccinated, and this is a model village for the State,” he told reporters on Thursday. Tiruvarur MLA Poondi Kalaivanan had taken up the initiative to achieve 100% vaccination and created awareness among the residents. This was the village where a memorial of former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi was coming up. At the national level, Weyan village in Bandipora district in Jammu and Kashmir had earlier achieved 100% vaccination coverage, Mr. Subramanian said. The Minister said that in every district, the government had decided to prioritise vaccination of persons residing in villages near tourism destinations where public converge and places where there are memorials. “Accordingly, work to vaccinate all tribal people and tea estate workers in the Nilgiris is in progress. All of them will be vaccinated in 10 days,” he added. Similarly, the government was aiming to achieve 100% vaccination in districts with less population such as the Nilgiris and Ariyalur, he said.

Stalin on Thursday announced that special clinics would be set up in all government medical colleges, with specialist doctors to address post-COVID-19 complications. Despite the fall in cases, there had been complaints of post-COVID-19 issues among patients, he said. Replying to the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the Governor for his address in the Assembly on Thursday, Mr. Stalin said the Samathuvapuram [egalitarian habitat] project, first implemented by former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, would continue to be implemented. The Chief Minister said old Samathuvapurams would be renovated and new ones set up. Named Samathuvapuram (later renamed Periyar Ninaivu Samathuvapuram ), the erstwhile DMK government (1996-2001) had implemented a project to provide housing to beneficiaries from all communities to reside on the same premises, ensuring social harmony among them. Mr. Stalin announced that 100 temples would be renovated without altering their heritage value, at a cost of Rs. 100 crore, in this fiscal. Tanks and cars in temples would be renovated, and festivals held in these temples as part of implementing the DMK’s promise to allocate Rs. 1,000 crore for temple renovations, he said.  He announced that major industries would be set up in Cheyyar, Tiruvannamalai district, and Tindivanam, Villupuram district. They would provide employment to 12,000 and 10,000 people respectively.

25 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tamil Nadu gradually adding backlog deaths to its virus tally||Tamil Nadu has been gradually adding backlog COVID-19 deaths to its tally since the last week of May after the cases began to fall. At least 337 deaths added daily in the media bulletin since the last week of May had actually occurred at least a month before their reporting date, indicating that these deaths happened during the ascending phase of the second wave. However, it is difficult to ascertain how many such backlog deaths have exactly been reconciled as the media bulletin released daily included deaths reported with varying durations of delay. For instance, of the 287 deaths reported on June 18, 173 had occurred within three days before the reporting date, 44 had occurred between three days and two weeks, 27 had occurred before two to four weeks and 43 had occurred at least four weeks ago. Two of these deaths were, in fact, reported after a delay more than 50 days. If deaths reported with a delay of at least two weeks are considered, then the State had reconciled at least 937 such deaths since the last week of May. The reporting of deaths with delays has particularly increased since the second week of June. From June 1 till June 23, the actual number of deaths occurred were 5,598. In the same period, the State’s media bulletin reported 7,514 deaths, a difference of 1,916. In contrast, during the month of April and May, the reported deaths were lesser than the deaths that occurred. (Please refer to the infographic for more details). The government has a State-level deaths committee in place to periodically audit and reconcile deaths that were missed. A senior official from the Medical and Family Welfare Department said that the delays mainly happened at the level of local bodies (in case of deaths in home quarantine) or the private or occasionally government hospitals. “Once the death reports are received, we do a verification and add it to our daily reporting figures. We want to ensure that all the missed deaths are reported,” he said.  Once the death reports are received we do a verification and add it to our daily reporting figures.

25 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Duraimurugan questions EPS over river linking project||Minister of Water Resources Duraimurugan on Thursday questioned AIADMK leader Edappadi K. Palaniswami’s role as Chief Minister in implementing the Godavari-Gundar scheme, when the latter urged the new DMK government to take steps to implement it. During a debate in the Assembly, Mr. Palaniswami urged the DMK government to implement various water projects for the benefit of the State. Mr. Duraimurugan intervened to say, “We have just come to power and you are forcing us to do this and that. What were you doing for the last 10 years [of AIADMK government] if the projects were important?” The Leader of the House also prompted Mr. Palaniswami to list out the challenges faced by the erstwhile government in implementing the scheme. Acquisition of lands was a major challenge in implementing various schemes, Mr. Palaniswami said, adding that the erstwhile DMK government, between 2006 and 2011, did not acquire lands to implement various water projects. Mr. Duraimurugan said if that was the case, the AIADMK government could have implemented the scheme during its two tenures over a decade. “You could have at least linked rivers within the State. It was during our leader Kalaignar ’s [M. Karunanidhi] tenure that we brought Krishna water to Tamil Nadu,” he said. While Mr. Palaniswami chose not to respond, AIADMK deputy floor leader O. Panneerselvam said the agreement to bring Krishna water to Tamil Nadu was signed when M.G. Ramachandran was Chief Minister. “I am not denying that. But the AIADMK government only signed the agreement. It was only during the DMK government that the channel was laid,” Mr. Duraimurugan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/duraimurugan-questions-eps-over-river-linking-project/article34959226.ece
25 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Failure of DSE to verify claims caused Rs. 23.27 crore loss||The failure of the Directorate of School Education (DSE) and the Directorate of Elementary Education (DEE) in verifying the correctness of claims preferred by the Tamil Nadu Textbook Corporation resulted in avoidable expenditure of Rs. 21.85 crore, according to the report of the Comptroller of Auditor General (GAG) of India. The report also said that the failure of the Director of School Education in detecting errors in textbooks led to avoidable expenditure of Rs. 1.42 crore. The report tabled in the Assembly pointed out that the Tamil Nadu Textbook and Educational Services Corporation (TNTBESC), responsible for printing and distributing textbooks, had been including an additional amount of 5% on the cost of paper as handling charges. But it was not a component of the production cost, as approved by the State government, in an order issued in December 2010. The CAG report said on being pointed out by the audit, the corporation discontinued the levy in the consequent claim (May 2019) in respect of the academic year 2019-20. “But the DSE and the DEE failed to verify the correctness of the claim submitted by TNTBESC. Their failure has resulted in the excess payment of Rs. 21.85 crore during the period from2016-17to2018-19,” the report said. An additional avoidable payment of Rs. 1.42 crore was paid to TNTBESC for printing and supplying 6,36,900 copies of books for two subjects for 11th and 12th standards. According to the DSE, reprinting was necessitated by certain conceptual errors pointed out by the teachers. Errors found “Audit found that the conceptual errors were in the foreword and preface of the textbooks and in one to seven inner pages of these eight books. A total of Rs. 1.42 crore was paid to TNTBESC in March 2016,” the report said. The report added that even though a system was put in place from2017-18for the scrutiny of textbooks before ordering print, the DSE had not checked or reviewed them. The report also recommended the institutionalisation of a fail-safe rigorous checking of textbooks before mass printing.

25 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Govt. will put a full stop to COVID -19’||Due to the steps taken by the DMK government, the spread of COVID-19 has come down and even if the third wave strikes, Tamil Nadu has the strength to face it, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin said in the Assembly on Thursday. With everyone’s cooperation, the government will put a full stop to the pandemic, he said. In his reply to the debate on the Motion of Thanks on the Governor’s Address in the House, Mr. Stalin criticised the erstwhile AIADMK government for not having taken sufficient steps to counter the spread of COVID-19 in the State. Launching a tirade against former Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, Mr. Stalin said it was wrong to say that the AIADMK had controlled COVID-19, and went on to question Mr. Palaniswami’s functions as the Chief Minister, after the model code of conduct came into force on February 26. Referring to Mr. Palaniswami’s statement that since the code was in force, the Chief Minister could not personally oversee the COVID-19 situation, Mr. Stalin asked whether he had not undertaken any activity as Chief Minister since then. “Have you not undertaken any work after February 26? Did anyone tie the former Chief Minister’s [Mr. Palaniswami] hands so that he should not do anything to control COVID-19?” Mr. Stalin asked. He wondered whether the AIADMK had forgotten that it was still in power between February 26 and May 6. “The pandemic is not a political issue. It is not a dispute between parties. And it is not an issue facing the government. It is a people’s problem. The government will put a full stop to COVID-19 with the cooperation of everyone,” he said. Later, when AIADMK leader Edappadi K. Palaniswami spoke, he denied any lethargy on the part of his government and went on to list the steps taken by it. Due to the model code and since the Election Commission of India did not grant permission to oversee the COVID-19 situation, the Chief Secretary was managing governance during the period, he said. ‘Will fulfil promises’ During his concluding remarks, Mr. Stalin said, “We were patient for 10 years, and now we have come to power. We will fulfil the promises we have made. You need not have an iota of doubt over this.” Among those who commented on the Chief Minister’s reply was Leader of the House and Minister for Water Resources Duraimurugan, who compared Mr. Stalin’s leadership qualities with that of former Chief Ministers C.N. Annadurai and M. Karunanidhi. Three Bills that were introduced in the House were passed by voice vote. Later, Speaker M. Appavu adjourned the House sine die .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-will-put-a-full-stop-to-covid-19/article34959236.ece

25 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Rental bike, CCTV camera footage helped crack ATM case||CCTV camera footage of a bike used by a pair of suspects led the police to a breakthrough in the investigation into the SBI ATM thefts in the city. The gang from Haryana struck at 14 places between June 15 and 18. Similar offences were committed in other places across the country as well. Following initial reports, Police Commissioner Shankar Jiwal held an emergency meeting on Tuesday with bank officials and deputed a special team to nab the suspects, who had come from the northern states and committed the offence. During the course of the investigation, the special team arrested one Amir Arsh, of Ballabhgarh, Haryana, with help from the Haryana Police. During interrogation, the accused confessed, explaining the modus operandi of the group and provided other leads. Mr. Jiwal told The Hindu , “Immediately after the cases were reported, we deputed a special team and nabbed a suspect, who flew back from the city. Five or six more persons could have been part of the gang. The groups are interconnected and from different States. With help of other State police, we will try to locate and arrest them.” Explaining the events that led to a breakthrough in the case, a senior police officer said more than five groups had operated within the city limits. They came in pairs on motorbikes and stole the money from the ATMs. CCTV camera footage from one of the ATM kiosks showed a bike passing by at the time of occurrence. The accused were wearing helmets to avoid identification. The police checked the registration number of the bike and traced it to the owner, who was renting them out. He provided them with details of the person who rented the vehicle. From there, the team collected the phone numbers and photographs of the accused, and tracked the signal of a mobile phone used by one of them, who was moving toward the airport. They collected his ticket details and traced him to Delhi. Based on his information, the team gathered details about the other accused, an officer said. Details have been shared with the Haryana police. “We will try to secure the remaining accused soon,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rental-bike-cctv-camera-footage-helped-crack-atm-case/article34959208.ece
25 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Tangedco failed to levy Rs. 827.64 cr. damages’||The Tangedco did not levy liquidated damages of Rs. 827.64 crore on nine long-term suppliers who delayed the commencement of supplies from scheduled delivery dates during the previous AIADMK regime. It also paid enhanced tariff to eight long-term power suppliers, despite them not supplying power for the first two years of the agreement period, leading to an avoidable expenditure of Rs. 712.03 crore till 2018, the CAG report for the year ending March 2018 said. The CAG report, tabled in the Assembly on Thursday, also found that Tangedco did not follow the guidelines laid down by the Centre for phasing out the accumulation of ash on land, and accumulated 62.15 million metric tonnes in ash dykes in three thermal power stations, as on March 2019. “The continued dumping of ash on land resulted in the contamination of groundwater, the Buckingham Canal and the Kosasthalaiyar river,” the report said. On medium-term power purchase agreements, Tangedco did not claim liquidated damages of Rs. 24 crore from two suppliers for a delay in commencement of supply. “Instead, it procured the shortfall quantity at higher rates, resulting in the avoidable expenditure of Rs. 116.04 crore,” it said. The CAG also found that a delay in the completion of projects by central generating stations (CGS) had led to Tangedco bearing cost escalation of Rs. 2,381.54 crore, by way of additional cost in tariff, besides purchasing the shortfall quantity by incurring avoidable expenditure of Rs. 2,099.48 crore. As Tangedco was not drawing the entitled share of power from low-cost CGS and drawing the same quantity from other costlier sources, it incurred an avoidable expenditure of Rs. 349.67 crore. It also became liable for payment of higher tariff for purchasing solar power, resulting in excess expenditure of Rs. 605.48 crore, the report said. The purchase of power from co-generation plants, by terminating the existing agreements and purchasing the same through the short-term route, also resulted in avoidable expenditure of Rs. 93.41 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tangedco-failed-to-levy-rs-82764-cr-damages/article34959238.ece
25 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||UPSC calls for revised list of DGP candidates||Barely three days before the crucial meeting scheduled in New Delhi to finalise the panel of officers for appointment as Director-General of Police/head of police force, the Union Public Service Commission has called for a revised list of eligible officers from the Tamil Nadu Government. Tamil Nadu DGP J.K. Tripathy is retiring on June 30. While the names of seven qualifying DGP rank officers belonging to 1987 to 1989 batches of IPS was initially sent for empanelment, top sources in the police headquarters here said a revised list, including nine ADGP rank officers of the 1990 and 1991 batches, has been sent to the UPSC. The UPSC follows a prescribed format, guidelines of the Supreme Court in the Prakash Singh case and a 360-degree assessment to shortlist three or five names to be sent to the State governments for choosing one as head of the police force. The Supreme Court had fixed a minimum residual service of six months for consideration of appointment to the top post. C. Sylendra Babu belonging to the 1987 batch is the senior most IPS officer in the list followed by Karan Singha of the same batch. The third senior most officer is Sanjay Arora of the 1988 batch who is on central deputation and was on Wednesday posted as Special DGP, Central Reserve Police Force. Others in the batch are Sunil Kumar Singh and P. Kandaswamy. While the 1989 batch has Md. Shakeel Akhter and Braj Kishore Ravi, the fresh list sent to the UPSC comprises Shankar Jiwal, A.K. Viswanathan, Abash Kumar, T.V. Ravichandran (on central deputation), Seema Agrawal in the 1990 batch and Amraesh Pujari, M. Ravi, K. Jayanth Murali and Karuna Sagar of the 1991 batch. All these officers have the qualifying service of 30 years in IPS and are serving in the rank of DGP and ADGPs. Going by the Supreme Court ruling in the Prakash Singh case, an officer posted as DGP/head of police force in a State will hold office for a minimum two years irrespective of the date of superannuation. Though the UPSC cleared five names in 2017 and three names in 2019, the State government can insist on five names, going by provisions under the Tamil Nadu Police Establishment Act, sources said and added that the State Government can pick any one from the list sent by the UPSC to head the police force.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/upsc-calls-for-revised-list-of-dgp-candidates/article34959217.ece
25 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Excess procurement of fans, mixies, grinders resulted in Rs. 124.43 crore loss: CAG||The non-compliance to applicable codal provisions and deviations from financial propriety while implementing a scheme for the distribution of electric fans, mixies and grinders (FMGs) to women has resulted in a loss of Rs. 124.43 crore to the Tamil Nadu government [during the previous AIADMK regime], a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India has stated. The CAG report on the general and social sector for the year ending March 2018 (Report no. 1 of 2020), tabled in the Assembly on Thursday, said excess procurement was to the tune of Rs. 102.45 crore. Besides, the loss due to storage in uninsured godowns was Rs. 13.64 crore, and there was avoidable expenditure on pre-delivery inspection, which stood at Rs. 8.34 crore. The government of Tamil Nadu (GoTN) introduced the scheme in June 2011, and it was to be implemented in five phases. After the distribution of FMGs to all eligible beneficiaries in the fifth and final phase in March 2018, the Revenue Department held a huge stock of FMGs at its storage points. “Faced with surplus stocks, GoTN ordered [April 2017] the distribution of surplus appliances for free to police personnel, schools and anganwadis, among others, in contravention of the scheme’s guidelines,” the report said. “Further, GoTN did not assess the utility of domestic model mixies and grinders at noon meal centres in schools and anganwadis, which did not have grinding needs for items on their menu,” the report added. In reply to an audit query, the Collectors of Tirunelveli, Dharmapuri and Perambalur and the Tahsildar of Dharmapuri said the surplus stocks arose on account of deaths, permanent shifting, migration, bogus cards and the deletion of ineligible beneficiaries. The State government said the number of eligible beneficiaries was originally estimated at 1.85 crore, but it came down to 1.81 crore due to diligent monitoring of the distribution process. “The reply endorses the audit’s finding that the Department should have taken measures to verify the June 2011 data, especially in view of the surplus stocks, arising after distribution every year,” the CAG report added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/excess-procurement-of-fans-mixies-grinders-resulted-in-rs-12443-crore-loss-cag/article34959232.ece

This resulted in the avoidable expenditure of Rs. 1.69 crore to DoET. The distribution of laptops to students was made only after the close of the academic year,” the report said.  The CAG also found that ELCOT had allotted two acres of land required by Ford India to meet its green norms, without following due process. It allotted the land which belonged to Satyam Computer Services for the creation of a green belt by Ford, for which the IT company had already paid Rs. 1.01 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/elcot-faulted-over-laptop-purchase/article34959222.ece

25 June 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Folk artistes seek govt.’s attention to their plight||With their livelihood being hit for two consecutive years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, folk artistes staged a performance at Chinnavedampatti on the outskirts of Coimbatore on Thursday urging the State government to provide cash assistance to all the artistes. The event was held outside a temple in Chinnavedampatti, which saw the performances by nadaswaram and thavil players, besides those of folk arts. According to K. Nanjappan, vice-president of Coimbatore District Association of Stage Play, Folk Arts and Nadaswaram Artistes, the Tamil months of Panguni, Chithirai and Vaikasi (from mid-March to mid-June) is when the artistes get most of the employment opportunities through temple festivals, weddings and other events. “Through our earnings in these three months, we sustain our families for the remaining nine months and pay back our loans,” he told The Hindu . However, the nationwide lockdown in 2020 and the restrictions in April followed by the lockdown in May this year had robbed off their opportunities, causing financial distress to the artistes, he said. The 60-year-old Mr. Nanjappan, who has been playing the percussion instrument thavil for the past 45 years, said that they had petitioned Chief Minister M.K. Stalin and the Coimbatore district administration in May regarding their plight, but no response had been received, so far. His 32-year-old son N. Sathish, a fourth-generation thavil player, said that some of the folk artistes who were members of the welfare board received cash assistance of Rs. 2,000 last year from the State government. However, no cash assistance was provided to the artistes this year, he alleged. Many weddings that were held during the pandemic did not hire nadaswaram and thavil artistes despite these instruments being a part of weddings, he said. With no other employment opportunities at hand, the folk artistes resort to taking loans from known circles and even mortgaging jewellery, Mr. Nanjappan said. “We have to somehow survive,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/folk-artistes-seek-govts-attention-to-their-plight/article34959252.ece
25 June 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Greater caution advised while giving devices to children for online classes||A woman from Coimbatore rural approached the Cyber Cell of the Coimbatore District (Rural) Police two months ago after she found that around Rs. 30,000 was missing from her bank account without her knowledge. Though she had approached the Cyber Cell seeking an investigation into the loss of money, she returned home in shock after coming to know that it was her son studying in class X who had spent the money for online games. Officials at the Cyber Cell found out that the boy had been playing different games on the mobile which was given to him for online classes and he used the parent’s bank account for purchasing addons and gadgets in online games. The boy had made online payments of small sums on multiple occasions and the parent did not get alerts on the withdrawals. This is not an isolated case as many parents who lost money later identified from banks and from detailed account statements that their children themselves had used the money for various needs including gaming. According to Cyber Cell officers, parents must exercise greater caution while giving mobile phones, tablets and computers to children for online classes as chances are high for them to get attracted to online games, social media and video streaming platforms. T. Arulanandam, State auditor of Tamil Nadu High Higher Secondary School Graduate Teachers Association, said parents and elders should ensure supervision when children used mobile phones and tablets for classes. “Working parents should ensure that someone is there in the house to monitor them or enable parental control options in devices to check their activities,” he said. Rural Superintendent of Police S. Selvanagarathinam has urged parents to use parental control options in devices to restrict the content which children can access. This would also help in restricting obscene advertisements and pop-up advertisements while using browsers and streaming platforms. In the Android platform, parental control options can be enabled through the Google Play app (tap the profile icon at the top right-settings-family-parental controls-turn on parental controls). Parental controls can also be done in Android devices by choosing options in the ‘digital wellbeing and parental control’ section in settings. In iOS devices, parental control can be done by choosing various options in the ‘Screen Time’ section in settings. The app ‘Google Family Link for parents’ also offers advanced options of parental control of devices used by children and teenagers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/greater-caution-advised-while-giving-devices-to-children-for-online-classes/article34959265.ece
25 June 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Nod sought to reopen shops||The trade in Coimbatore district has appealed to the State government to relax lockdown restrictions and permit shops to reopen. The Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Coimbatore, has appealed to the District Collector G.S. Sameeran to recommend to the State government reopening of retail outlets from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and industries from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. in Coimbatore district. Chamber president C. Balasubramanian said in a release that because of lockdown restrictions since the first week of May, trade and industry had lost business. Customers preferred to buy goods from other districts or States because of restrictions here. This caused more damage to the regional businesses. Hence, the government should allow shops and industries to open shutters next week, he said.

V. Saravanan, 34, of Kambankudi near Aranthangi and his relative V. Ravichandran, 41, of Karaikudi were arrested on a complaint lodged by the bank’s branch manager. Police sources said Ravichandran who was employed in Oman returned to India in February and could not leave again due to suspension of fights in the wake of lockdown clamped to check the spread of COVID-19. Ravichandran apparently surfed the net and watched videos on ‘doubling money.’ He found a contact, an African, on the Net and left for Bengaluru in May-end. Ravichandran was asked to bring currencies in Rs. 2,000 denomination to double the money. Ravichandran handed over Rs. 50,000 cash to the African man who gave him a bag containing counterfeit cash for Rs. 60,000. Ravichandran tried in a vain bid to contact the African man and returned to Karaikudi knowing that he had been cheated. He narrated the incident to his relative Saravanan who took the currencies to the ATM in Aranthangi to deposit in his wife’s account. As he could not get the acknowledgement slip after depositing the cash, Saravanan contacted the bank’s branch manager. However, the manager found that the currency notes deposited in the machine were fake and lodged a complaint with the Superintendent of Police in Pudukottai a few days ago. The complaint was referred to the District Crime Branch which conducted inquiries with Saravanan after examining the video footage during which the entire crime came to light. Saravanan and Ravichandran were arrested and remanded to judicial custody.

Collector K V Muralidharan instructed the revenue authorities to create awareness in villages through ‘tom-tom.’ The officials said that they had captured images of deer and some wild pigs from the cameras positioned inside the forests during the last 24 hours. The villagers need not panic but stay indoors. Revenue and town panchayat officials here have distributed pamphlets to the locals to remain at their dwellings. Adequate measures have been taken to capture the leopard and they urged the villagers not to spread rumours. The Forest Department officials had captured a leopard from the Kailasanathar foot hills and let it off in Kannagi hills near Kumuli in 2017 after a similar incident.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cameras-installed-to-track-movement-of-leopard/article34959494.ece

25 June 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Liquid bio-fertilizer production begins||Large-scale manufacture of liquid bio-fertilizer, that nourishes soil health and consequently steps up crop yield, commenced in the State Government’s facility at Ettaiyapuram. The liquid bio-fertilizer, being prepared at Agriculture Regulatory Market godown in Ettaiyapuram, will be supplied to Virudhunagar and Kanniyakumari districts, besides meeting the requirements of Thoothukudi district. Under the National Agriculture Development Programme (NADP), the State Government established the solid bio-fertilizer unit at Ettaiyapuram in 2009 – 2010 and the product is being sent to various districts to be sold to the farmers through the Agriculture Extension Centres. Now, this facility has been upgraded for preparing the liquid bio-fertilizer from Wednesday onwards. “The objective behind establishing this facility is to encourage the farmers to use the bio-fertilizers to the maximum possible extent instead of using chemical fertilizers that poisons soil and the microorganisms living in the soil to facilitate crop growth and the yield. Manufacturing the liquid bio-fertilizer is an attempt to strengthen the soil health by supplying the nutrient to the farmers,” said Dr. Senthil Raj, who formally inaugurated the production of liquid bio-fertilizer. The annual capacity of this facility is a little over 50,000 litres. “While 37,500 litres are allocated for Thoothukudi district, Virudhunagar district will get 10,000 litres and the remaining 4,300 litres will be given to Kanniyakumari district. Moreover, this manufacturing unit will continue to produce 94.51 tonnes of solid bio-fertilizers to be sent to Thoothukudi, Virudhunagar, Tirunelveli, Tenkasi and Madurai districts,”he informed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/liquid-bio-fertilizer-production-begins/article34959496.ece
25 June 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Tangedco takes up maintenance work||The Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (TANGEDCO) has completed maintenance of 26 substations and 111 power lines during the last five days to ensure uninterrupted power supply to the residents during the pandemic. As maintenance work was not taken up in sub-stations during the last two months, it led to frequent interruption in power supply so that the TANGEDCO initiated steps for completing the exercise. Instead of clamping daylong power-cuts in the areas where the maintenance is being done, the TANGEDCO workers stopped power supply to the consumers only for 3 hours to complete the work. After inspecting the work near Muthaiahpuram on Thursday, Superintending Engineer J.A. Gnaneswaran said maintenance of relays, transformers, feeders, air releasing devices and aluminium bars in 26 sub-stations were completed between June 19 and 23. Moreover, the creepers grown on the transformers, electric poles, power cables and branches of trees coming in contact with the power cables were removed at 1,361 places during these five days. Reinstalled A total of 116 damaged and slant electric poles had been reinstalled in the right position while 301 damaged insulators were replaced. Moreover, 26 new electric poles had been installed in the places where the power cables were gradually drooping to pose a serious threat to the public and vehicles passing through these roads. “We’ve planned to complete this exercise by June 28 which will ensure uninterrupted power supply to the consumers in the coming days,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tangedco-takes-up-maintenance-work/article34959498.ece
25 June 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Bus stand plan brings STP revamp exercise to a halt||In the wake of a proposal to build an integrated bus stand at Panchapur on Tiruchi-Madurai highway on the outskirts of the city, the Tiruchi Corporation has decided to suspend its plan to revamp the Panjapur sewage treatment plant (STP). The Corporation constructed the 87 MLD plant as part of phase-I of the underground drainage project on a vast tract of its land in 1995. After processing, the treated sewage water is being let into the open land which was made as waste stabilisation ponds. However, out of the 87 MLD, the Corporation used only a portion of the land to process 57 MLD of sewage water. Another portion of the land remains unused. With the idea of bringing the unused land to use, the Corporation prepared a plan. Since the unused land is needed to be modified in accordance with the waste stabilisation pond method, it began the task of establishing the required infrastructure in January this year. It was one of the components of phase-II underground drainage project being under implementation in different parts of the city. It is learnt that the work has been stopped with immediate effect following the State government’s proposal to build an integrated bus stand here. The civic body owns about 570 acres of land in Panchapur. About one fourth of the land is being used for re-using the treated water from the sewage treatment plant. The Corporation plans to allot at least 50 acres of land for building the bus stand with all modern facilities. The move to stop the modification of unused land into waste stabilisation ponds is to enable the authorities to shortlist a suitable site for the bus stand project. “We are in the process of finding the best possible site for the bus stand. Hence, we have decided to stop the process to set up waste stablisation ponds,” says a senior corporation official. After a detailed study, the sewage treatment plant for the phase-II UGD project would be moved to a remote location of 570 acres of the land at Panchapur, the official added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bus-stand-plan-brings-stp-revamp-exercise-to-a-halt/article34959550.ece
25 June 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Akila gets its very own pond to have a splash||Splashing water on itself with its trunk and moving about freely and sometimes lying in the pool of water to beat the heat, 19-year-old Akila - the elephant of Sri Jambukeswarar Akilandeswari Temple at Tiruvanaikoil here thoroughly enjoyed its bath in the pond built exclusively for the pachyderm on the huge temple complex. Akila was in a joyous mood on Thursday afternoon during the nearly hour-long bath it had in the pond set up on the 1.5 acre Nachiarthoppu which is in close proximity to the elephant’s shelter. It was brought by its mahout and his assistant for the bath. The six-foot-deep pond is spacious so that the elephant can move about freely and relax itself in the pool of water, said the temple’s executive officer C. Mariappan. There is a ramp for the elephant to get inside the pond. From now on, Akila, the darling of devotees, will have its daily bath in the pond, created with substantial contributions from donors, Mr. Mariappan said. Earlier it used to be given a bath using a shower system near its shelter. A borewell has been sunk to fill the pond with groundwater which will be pumped out and used for the temple garden after the bath, Mr. Mariappan said. During the lockdown, 100 coconut tree saplings, 100 mango tree saplings and some jackfruit tree saplings were planted in the Nachiarthoppu so that there will be greenery around the pond. Walking track too Akila is used to be taken for a morning walk daily on the newly created mud track inside the Nachiarthoppu. The elephant, born in May 2002 in Assam, was brought to the Tiruvanaikoil temple in December 2011 after the demise of its predecessor Shanthi. The Tiruvanaikoil temple is situated on 19.5 acres and is a ‘pancha bootha sthalam’ representing one of the five elements - water.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/akila-gets-its-very-own-pond-to-have-a-splash/article34959545.ece
25 June 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Omni bus operators in a quandary||With the State government yet to permit operation of bus services, omni bus operators say they are struggling to stay afloat. On an average day, the omni bus stand here would be brimming with crowd, food stalls serving food to travellers, and passengers waiting to board buses. However, over the last few months, things have not been the same after the COVID-19 induced lockdown. The bus owners hope that the government would come to their rescue Speaking to The Hindu , R. Balakrishnan, president, Tiruchi Omni Bus Operators’ Association, said that the past year was one of difficult and trying times. “We are unable to pay bus drivers, cleaners and other staff. We also have hefty loans to pay off. We are unsure of how to go about it,” he said. The omni buses ply to Thanjavur, Kumbakonam, Nagapattinam, Puducherry, Madurai, and even as far as Chennai and Bengaluru. “Most of our customers were people travelling to Chennai and Bengaluru for work. There was not a single bus service which plied to Chennai and Bengaluru empty,” a bus owner said. In the last year, however, not a single trip has been satisfactory, Mr. Balakrishnan said. “If the bus went from here to a certain destination, it will return empty. These kinds of trips cause more harm than good as the costs of the trip double, with not enough income,” he said. A section of bus operators are firm on their decision that they would not begin ferrying passengers until the road tax was waived. “Members of our associations are going to meet the Transport Minister and also submit a petition to the Chief Minister. We cannot go on like this,” Mr. Balakrishnan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/omni-bus-operators-in-a-quandary/article34959552.ece
25 June 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Demand for English medium sections goes up in government schools||A combination of two factors, ‘Samacheer Kalvi’ and high fee structure in matriculation schools, seem to be working in favour of government and aided schools against the backdrop of the debilitating impact of COVID-19 on the economy, according to school heads who say they are getting lots of enquiries from parents in lower-middle class families for seats in English medium sections. Families where the breadwinners have lost jobs due to the pandemic and have been necessitated to relocate to their native villages are more inclined towards admitting their wards in the nearest government schools, the school heads say. Fee up and up Private schools, in general, collect more fee than the extent fixed by the Committee headed by a reired High Court Judge, parents complain. “I felt it was prudent to shift my children to a government school near my village since the private schools are anticipating a further upward revision of fee,” Kumaresan, who had to relocate to his village after losing his job in a fabrication unit in Thuvakudi, said, adding that in any case, there was no point staying in the town after losing the job. According to Rajamanickam, a headmaster of a government higher secondary school, students enrolled in English medium sections also enjoy the benefit of government’s welfare schemes: nutritious noon meal, textbooks, notebooks, laptop, uniform, footwear, school bag, crayons, colour pencils, geometry box, atlas, shoes, socks, bus pass and bicycles. There is a growing realisation among parents, particularly those in the lower-middle class category, that the quality of education in government schools is far better, he says. While the School Education Department’s policy note for 2020-21 states that the government has appointed sufficient number of teachers in government schools to ensure a comfortable Pupil Teacher Ratio - one teacher for every 30 students - a section of school heads seeks to point out that the sanction of teaching posts has to be increased in view of the rise in workload when English medium sections are started. As such, there are no separate teaching vacancies for English-medium sections, a senior official said. Though the strength of teachers is not an issue during the lockdown period, the shortage will be felt when the in-person classes resume, the school heads say.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/demand-for-english-medium-sections-goes-up-in-government-schools/article34959546.ece

According to the police, Shimul Gazi (30) approached Manikandan, a resident of Ammapalayam, to seek a house for rent in April. Introducing himself as hailing from Bangladesh, he claimed that he was employed as a tailor in a private garment company and that he could not produce photocopies of his documents such as passport and visa as the originals were with the company.

25 June 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Tourism hit in the Nilgiris||In the last one year since the COVID-19 pandemic, tourism industry in the Nilgiris has fallen by a staggering 80%. Based on statistics from the horticulture and tourism departments, which calculate the footfall to the Government Botanical Garden in Udhagamandalam as a barometer to gauge the tourist inflow into the district, the number of tourists to the Nilgiris fell from 28.92 lakh in 2019, prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, to 5.88 lakh in 2020. In 2021, only 63,850 visitors have been recorded. “Cumulatively, since the pandemic began, tourism has fallen by more than 80 %, as most of the visitors in 2020 had visited prior to the first cases being reported in Tamil Nadu,” officials from the horticulture department said. While the gardens and parks were opened once again during the last few months of 2020, the district once again closed to tourists earlier this year after the second wave of infections hit the State. John Bosco, a tourist guide and tour operator in Udhagamandalam, said there were around 120 tourist guides, out of whom 26 are certified guides, who help travellers find their way to popular tourist spots and also help arrange accommodation. “These guides would earn anywhere between Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 2,000 a day during peak season. But due to the pandemic, many are struggling to pay bills and provide for their families,” said Mr. Bosco. Similarly, boatmen at the Ooty Lake and Boat House have also had their livelihoods impacted. According to officials, there are around 40 boatmen at the Ooty Lake and Boat House, and they are paid based on the number of boat trips they make each day. “As the Ooty Lake and Boat House too has not been functioning for the large part of 2020 and 2021, their livelihoods too have been affected,” said an official from the State tourism department. The tourism department has written to the government to provide monetary relief to the boatmen, and officials say they hope that tourists would once again be allowed into the Nilgiris in the coming months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tourism-hit-in-the-nilgiris/article34959262.ece

According to officials, the estate in question, the Silver Cloud Estate, had applied for permission to fell 500 silver oak trees in 2018 and had been given the permission to do so by the district committee headed by the Collector. However, in November and December of 2020 and January of 2021, the estate had felled 200 native trees along with the 500 trees they had been given permission for felling. Illegal tree felling Recently, officials from Nilgiris Forest Division visited the estate and found that they had illegally felled the trees and booked a case under the Tamil Nadu Preservation of Private Forests Act. Disciplinary action had been initiated against two forest range officers, one forester and a guard who had since been suspended, forest officials confirmed. The four had been posted in-charge of the range when the illegal felling occurred. Illegal tree felling without proper permission has become a source of concern in the Nilgiris forest division. Recently, reports of private estate owners circumventing established procedures to obtain permission to fell trees by claiming them to be at risk of falling on houses led the department to set up a check-post in Kil Kotagiri to prevent illegal movement of timber from the area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/four-forest-staff-suspended/article34959273.ece

25 June 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Warning to cable TV operators||Collector J. Meghanath Reddy has warned local cable television operators and multi-system operators against promoting cable connections of private operators among subscribers of Tamil Nadu Arasu Cable TV Corporation. In a press release, he said that TACTV has so far distributed 1.47 lakh set top boxes through which subscribers get cable TV signal for a monthly charge of Rs. 140 plus GST. However, some operators were telling subscribers that TACTV signal would no more be offered. After getting the TACTV set top boxes from the subscribers they were providing set top boxes of private cable operators and were causing revenue loss to the State exchequer. The local cable operators who had taken such TACTV set top boxes from the subscribers had neither activated them nor handed them over to TACTV office for the last three months. The Collector warned of stringent action against such operators and MSOs. If the set top boxes developed technical snag or if the connection were snapped for non-payment of monthly subscription charges or if the subscribers had shifted from one place to another, they should hand over the set top box along with the adaptor and remote control device to the local cable TV operator. Subscribers who are forced to switch over from TACTV connections to private operators’ cable TV connections can lodge complaint over 04562-252257 or 94980-02598.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/warning-to-cable-tv-operators/article34959486.ece

The daily death toll had gone as high as 15, which was recorded on May 31. “Ever since, beds at Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai and Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital got filled up, the number of deaths in the district increased, especially at various Government Hospitals,” a health official said. However, as the demand for beds eased in the two tertiary hospitals, the number of deaths started to fall. The lockdown since May 10 also helped in containing the spread of the viral infection. The daily case tally that touched four digits – a maximum of 1,287 cases were recorded on May 22 – gradually declined since the last week of May. In the last three days, the number of cases has been in two-digits. On Thursday, the district recorded 82 fresh cases and 88 discharges. Madurai district recorded 112 new COVID-19 cases to register an overall case tally of 71,793. A total of 128 persons were discharged from hospitals and healthcare facilities in the district. The district recorded two fatalities, with which its total death count rose to 1,077.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/after-nearly-two-months-virudhunagar-records-no-death/article34959502.ece

25 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Distribution of dry ration kits gets mired in controversy||The State’s initiative to distribute dry ration kits to migrant construction workers at a cost of over Rs. 31 crore as part of lockdown relief has run into rough weather. While there are instances of legislators misusing the welfare measure to bolster their own image, there are also complaints of poor quality foodgrains, bought at a higher cost, reaching beneficiaries. The government has started distribution of kits costing Rs. 823 each containing 10 grocery items. This was after a nudge from the Supreme Court, High Court of Karnataka, and Karnataka Legal Services Authority which asked the government to ensure there are no hunger deaths. ‘Unfit for consumption’ As the kits have started reaching people, reports of poor quality grain being provided are emerging. “Many workers to whom we distributed kits in Bommanahalli area have complained that foodgrains are unfit for consumption,” Lingaraju, CITU district secretary, said. Across unions, members claimed that the best quality foodgrains were available in the open market for about Rs. 650. “Retail price of what is being distributed by the government has been estimated to be about Rs. 530,” said Mr. Lingaraju. However, Labour Commissioner and Chairman of the Karnataka Construction Workers Welfare Board Akram Pasha said Rs. 823 per kit had been approved by the Finance Ministry. About 3.8 lakh kits, costing Rs. 31.27 crore to the Karnataka Construction Workers Welfare Fund, are to be distributed across the State, and about 1.2 lakh kits have been distributed already, Labour Department sources confirmed. The unions, in a meeting on June 9 with Labour Minister A. Shivaram Hebbar, opposed the very idea of providing ration kits at this point and also questioned distribution method. They had, instead, sought Rs. 10,000 per month for three months starting from May for workers through direct benefit transfer. The cash bailout, the unions argued, would also spur the demand in the economy. Many felt it was too late in the day to distribute foodgrains since lockdown has been lifted. Sources in the department said that about 2 lakh kits were being distributed in Bengaluru through legislators, an issue unions have flagged. “The government is committed to providing 54,640 kits to be distributed through 13 trade unions. Even half of these have not been given yet,” said Muniraju Shamanna, AITUC Bengaluru district vice-president who took part in the June 9 meeting. Benefit to voters “We had put forth our condition not to involve legislators in the distribution, which was not agreed to by the government. The result is that most of the beneficiaries are voters of these legislators,” Karnataka State Building and Other Construction Workers Federation general secretary K. Mahantesh said. For unions such as INTUC, the assured food kits of about 10,000 are yet to reach, union president S.S. Prakasham rued. However, a senior official justified the involvement of legislators saying that the kits have been given to only those in whose constituencies large clusters of migrant workers are found. He, however, admitted it wasdifficult to ascertain if the kits given were the same as those given by the department since legislators were also distributing ration on their own. Mr. Pasha said that though legislators were involved, only registered workers will get kits. He said of about 7 lakh registered workers, 3.8 lakh would get benefits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/distribution-of-dry-ration-kits-gets-mired-in-controversy/article34959200.ece
25 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Suburban rail work to start in 3 months||After years of waiting, work on the 148-km suburban rail link for Bengaluru is slated to begin in three months. The State government has decided to invite the Prime Minister for the function, said Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Thursday, after reviewing progress of the doubling project between Cantonment and Heelalige. He travelled in a self-propelled inspection car for a distance of 31 km. The suburban rail project has four corridors: KSR Bengaluru – Devanahalli (41 km), Baiyappanahalli – Chikkabanavara (25.14 km), Kengeri – Whitefield (35.52 km), and Heelalige – Rajankunte (46.24 km). “I will request the Prime Minister to lay the foundation stone and I am 100% confident that he will come. The Union government has given approval for raising Rs. 7,000 crore loan for the project,” said Mr. Yediyurappa. Work will be taken up on the Baiyappanahalli-Chikkabanavara and Heelalige-Rajankunte corridors, and it will be completed in three and a half years, said a senior official. “Around 88% of the land required for the project is readily available. That is one of the major advantages we have with the project. The designing and financial modules have been approved. Tenders will be floated for construction work and in three months works will start,” said the official. The completion of elevated sections will be prioritised. “However, carrying out construction work on the same corridors where Indian Railways is operational is one of the major challenges,” he added. The suburban rail project is estimated to cost Rs. 15,767 crore. Both the State and Union governments will each bear 20% of the cost, while the remaining 60% will be raised through external sources. The State government has already released Rs. 400 crore. Doubling project The Rail Infrastructure Development Company (Karnataka) Ltd. (K-RIDE), which is executing the suburban rail project, has undertaken doubling work on two sections: Baiyappanahalli – Hosur and Yeshwantpur – Channasandra. The two doubling projects were sanctioned in the 2018-19, with 50:50 cost sharing by the State government and the Railways. The year 2023 has been set as the deadline to complete the work. The 48-km Baiyappanahalli to Hosur section line doubling is estimated to cost Rs. 499 crore. The State government has released Rs. 65 crore towards the project. Various factors during the second wave of COVID-19, from construction workers returning home to shortage of construction material, affected its progress. The doubling of the 22-km Yeshwanthpur-Channasandra section is estimated to cost Rs. 315 crore.  The designing and financial modules have been approved. Tenders will soon be floated for construction work GOVT. OFFICIAL||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/suburban-rail-work-to-start-in-3-months/article34959186.ece

Suresh Kumar has directed the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Chief Commissioner to relieve teachers from COVID-19-related duty. Mr. Kumar said teachers were needed to conduct admission campaigns and undertake work related to the upcoming board examination. “The list of teaching and non-teaching staff involved in examination work will be provided by the deputy directors of public instruction and they should be vaccinated on priority before the commencement of the SSLC examination,” Mr. Kumar said in his letter. The number of examination centres have been increased to 6,000 so that students can follow social distancing norms. “This will require more invigilators and teachers who will be deployed on SSLC examination duty,” stated a press release quoting the Minister. For college students The Higher Education Department will take a decision on whether physical classes can be conducted in July after all students above the age of 18, and teaching and non-teaching staff receive their first dose of vaccine. In a press release, Higher Education Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan said the department had decided to conduct vaccination drives at the college level. “The date of reopening of offline classes will be announced soon after the completion of the first dose of vaccination to all eligible students and staff,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/relieve-teachers-from-covid-19-duty/article34959202.ece
25 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Dormant Ward DETER Committees to be reactivated||The civic body is set to reactivate the Ward Decentralised Triage and Emergency Response (DETER) Committees for COVID-19 management. They had been constituted during the peak of the second wave of the pandemic for decentralised management, but barring a few most have become dormant. Senior officials of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) admitted that a few WDCs had not even met to discuss ward-level plans for COVID-19 management after they were constituted. With the outbreak of a third wave predicted in six to eight weeks, civic officials and civil society organisations have underscored the need to reactivate these committees. While there is no data readily available on the number of active WDCs, anecdotal evidence suggests the number is a low 20 of the total 198 committees constituted. Sapna Karim, head of civic participation, Janaagraha Centre for Citizenship and Democracy, said the active WDCs were driven by adept nodal officers working closely with volunteers. “It is important to strengthen this system to ramp up vaccination. With the caseload decreasing, this is the right time for capacity building and strengthening WDCs.” The WDC in Doddanekundi ward is one of the few that are active. Volunteers and members, who are also part of the ward committee, continue to closely monitor COVID-19 patients under home isolation and coordinate with the six testing teams deputed to different colonies and slum pockets in the ward. But that is not enough, according to urban expert Kathyayini Chamaraj from CIVIC. She said the committees should ideally work on four major roles — preparedness, response, mitigation, and recovery. “These committees are only active in the response role, ignoring the other three major roles. The WDCs should not be disbanded and should be constituted as and when the need arises,” she said. Concurring with civic experts, BBMP Special Commissioner (Health) D. Randeep told The Hindu that over the next two weeks, nodal officials would be directed to reactivate these WDCs. Committee members would also be directed to work with primary health centres and physical triage centres. “This way, there will be complete ownership of decentralised COVID-19management at the ward level,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dormant-ward-deter-committees-to-be-reactivated/article34959175.ece

The university also wrote to students last Tuesday stating that they could get in touch with their class counsellors, class teachers, mentors, and peer mentors if they needed psychological support.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/christ-deemed-to-be-university-to-probe-proctors-misconduct/article34959177.ece
25 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Murder of former councillor: eyewitnesses flee from scene||Four police teams have been formed to track down those who hacked 45-year-old Rekha Kadiresh to death in front of her office at Cottonpet on Thursday morning. The police are having a tough time getting people to come forward. “The attack was so brutal that although many people had gathered at the office and witnessed the murder, they ran away. No one is coming forward to give their statements,” a police officer said. Though the CCTV cameras outside the office had been turned away, the police have scanned footage from other cameras and have identified three men. “Two of the suspects were close confidants of the councillor. We have footage of them fleeing the scene on foot. The third suspect helped them escape,” said a senior police officer. The brutality of the attack and the fact that it was carried out in broad daylight has made this a high-profile case. Both Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai called Bengaluru Police Commissioner Kamal Pant directing him to crack the case at the earliest. ‘Politically motivated’ BJP city unit spokesperson N.R. Ramesh alleged political rivalry as the motive. “She was a popular leader in the area, and the party had decided to nominate her again and she was expected to win. With the council polls approaching, other aspirants desperate to win the seat from Chalavadipalya seem to have killed her,” he claimed. Mr. Ramesh, while expressing confidence that the police would arrest the accused, claimed there were larger forces at play. He cited the murder of the councillor’s husband, Kadiresh S., a rowdy-sheeter, who was hacked to death near Muneshwara Temple in Chalavadipalya. “There were bigger forces behind the murder of Kadiresh in 2018, which was never probed. The police were content with filing a charge-sheet against those who surrendered voluntarily,” he said. Though he did not make any direct allegation against him, Mr. Ramesh said Chamarajpet MLA B.Z. Zameer Ahmed Khan, in whose constituency Chalavadipalya lies, was encouraging “anti-social elements”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/murder-of-former-councillor-eyewitnesses-flee-from-scene/article34959179.ece

25 June 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Campaign to promote ‘Bili Bende’ in Udupi district||In a concerted effort by elected representatives, the Horticulture Department and a cooperative society, a campaign has been launched in Karkala, Udupi district, to promote the cultivation of a local variety, “Bili Bende” (white okra), involving 20,000 families under the brand name “Kaarla Bende”. Kaarla in Tulu means Karkala. Karkala MLA V. Sunil Kumar, who has taken the initiative, told The Hindu that the free seed distribution in his Assembly constituency covering Karkala and Hebri taluks began on June 1 and it went on for a fortnight covering 20,000 families. Though white okra is cultivated in other parts of the coastal belt, the type cultivated in Karkala and its surrounding areas grows to one feet in length. Hence, the campaign has been launched to make it a brand of Karkala. Its seeds have been procured from some local farmers and the Zonal Agricultural and Horticultural Research Station, Brahmavar, in Udupi district. The seeds were distributed through the help of gram panchayat members to three category of growers. They were given to those who sowed them within their compound walls in pots, growbags or in their kitchen garden; in about 10 to 15 cents of land; and to those who took up its cultivation in a large-scale manner on 25 cents of land and more. Stating that the “Bili Bende” began to yield in two months of planting, Mr. Kumar said that people will be urged to make any one dish out of it during functions and events in their houses to promote its vast use locally. Marketing link will be arranged to large growers to sell them in cities. A written material on how to cultivate the variety and its pest management was circulated on social media to reach out to people. Naveenchandra Jain, president of Parampara Multipurpose Cooperative Society, Karkala, which has also joined the campaign, said that the white okra has high fibre content. A variety of dishes can be made from it. Earlier, in January, the MLA had launched an initiative to promote the cultivation and marketing of a local variety of boiled rice under the brand name “Kaarla Kaje” which is being marketed by the same cooperative society. The MLA said that both the brand building activities have been taken up under “vocal4local” initiative. Mr. Kumar said that the cultivation of “Kaarla Kaje” will be promoted among 1,000 farmers in the current kharif season.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/campaign-to-promote-bili-bende-in-udupi-district/article34959346.ece

25 June 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Land deals: Sindhuri for comprehensive probe||The former Deputy Commissioner of Mysuru Rohini Sindhuri has called for expanding the scope of inquiry into the irregularities in land deals in the district to cover all technical issues, on the lines of the probe into construction of a swimming pool at the Deputy Commissioner’s residence in the city during her tenure. Ms. Sindhuri, who was transferred out of Mysuru following a public spat with the Mysuru City Corporation Commissioner Shilpa Nag, was embroiled in a controversy over the construction of the pool during the peak of the pandemic. After her transfer, Regional Commissioner G.C. Prakash was ordered to conduct an inquiry based on the complaint of a few JD(S) leaders and he submitted a report identifying six lapses. This included absence of approval from the technical department of the Public Works Department besides raising questions on the public utility of the pool. Responding to the report Ms. Sindhuri claimed the original allegations of misuse of COVID-19 funds for construction of the swimming pool were found to be false and hence the inquiry drifted away from it to raise only technical issues. Incidentally, the Regional Commissioner recently issued a clean chit to MLA for K.R. Nagar S.R. Mahesh on the construction of a choultry on a swathe of land in Mysuru which Ms. Sindhuri had flagged as illegal. She said a detailed inquiry trying to cover the widest breadth of even technical issues on the swimming pool issue was welcome. “But I wish the same detail and comprehensiveness is shown in inquiry into irregularities in land transactions by powerful politicians,” she added. The irregularities cited by her include land conversion in favour of Mr. Mahesh of nearly 1.39 acres in survey number 124/2, Lingambudhi village, Mysuru taulk, which was contrary to the Comprehensive Development Plan of Mysuru. But the inquiry into land irregularities was restricted to a single point — on whether it was constructed on a ‘rajakaluve’ or not – despite a list of multiple irregularities cited by her as the Deputy Commissioner of Mysuru, said Ms. Sindhuri. Meanwhile, Mr. Mahesh has threatened to initiate a breach of privilege motion against Ms. Sindhuri besides suing her for defamation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/land-deals-sindhuri-for-comprehensive-probe/article34959194.ece

This was confirmed by the lab at NIMHANS, Bengaluru, that carried out genome sequencing of the samples sent from the district. Mysuru District Health Officer K.H. Prasad confirmed to The Hindu the discovery of three more Delta cases, but he underlined that they were not Delta Plus variant. One Delta Plus variant was reported from Mysuru a few days ago. Out of the four Delta cases detected so far in Mysuru, three are Delta variants B1.617.2 and one is Delta Plus variant B1.617.2.1. “With the finding of more cases of Delta variants of the coronavirus, we have taken all necessary precautions,” he said. Dr. Prasad said the cases of Delta strains were detected in the same batch of 20 samples sent in May. These samples represented nearly 30,000 COVID-19 cases that were reported in that month, the DHO said, adding that samples from Mysuru are sent for genome sequencing once in 15 days. Another batch of 20-25 samples have been sent to the NIMHANS and the results are awaited, he said. None of patients, who are youngsters, infected by the Delta variants have shown any symptoms, with three of them who have recovered being in home isolation and one at a COVID-19 Care Center. “No deaths have occurred because of the variants and we are keeping tabs on their health status despite their being fully recovered,” the DHO said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/three-more-delta-variant-cases-of-covid-detected-in-mysuru/article34959176.ece

Shivakumar to become the next Chief Minister has peaked but they must understand that the BJP will again come to power in the State. He was speaking to reporters in Raichur on Thursday. Mr. Kateel said that Congress leaders will always show interest in and fight for power but not to protect and serve public interest. To a question, he replied that there is no groupism and differences among BJP leaders. “Minister C.P. Yogeshwar and MLA Arvind Bellad have not been involved in any dissident activities. They just met the Suttur seer in their personal capacity as they have liberty to visit any seer on their own,” Mr. Kateel said. When asked about the phone-tapping allegation, the BJP State president said that investigation is under way and the truth will come out after the completion of investigation. He defended MLA Ramesh Jarkiholi meeting the former Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and said that “nothing is wrong in meeting our leaders and Mr. Jarkiholi has not brought pressure to bear on us for a Ministerial berth.” Mr. Kateel also said that he will talk to MLC H.

The university will also need the nod of the government for continuing with these courses,” said Sabu Thomas, Vice Chancellor. An ordinance promulgated by the government as part of launching the open university had barred other universities from offering open and distance learning courses and private registrations. However, the delay on the part of the DEB in opening its web portal following the COVID-19 spread had affected SGNOU’s plans to offer the courses. Facilities ready Prof. Thomas said the varsity was ready to go ahead with the OLD courses, as it had the required infrastructural and academic facilities. The university has been offering open and distance learning courses successfully, he added. The UGC had permitted universities to offer ODL programmes if they had a minimum National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) score of 3.01 or figured among the top 100 ranks in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF). MGU is ranked 30 in the NIRF and has a cumulative grade point average of 3.24 under NAAC assessment . The government’s decision to bring ODL programmes under SGNOU had hit the revenue of varsities, as distance learning courses offered a steady revenue stream. Moreover, there were also many takers for the courses.  We have applied for permission from the Distance Education Bureau of UGC.

Josephine has said. The move comes close on the heels of the public outrage over the death of a 24-year-old woman at her in-laws’ house in Kollam on Monday, in a suspected case of dowry harassment. Her husband had been arrested and slapped with charges under Sections 498A (subjecting a woman to cruelty for dowry) and 304B (dowry death) of the Indian Penal Code. “The commission has consulted legal minds on the possible laws that could be initiated, and it will be presented before the government soon for follow-up action,” Ms. Josephine says. The commission has found that people continue to give dowry in various other names even though it is prohibited under law, and despite several incidents of dowry-related deaths and harassment. Several complaints Ms. Josephine says the commission has received several complaints alleging that the husband’s family has taken possession of the money and gold given to the bride by her parents. “There should also be a law to regulate expensive weddings in the State. We have to keep a ceiling on the expenditure and the commission will recommend it based on legal opinion,” she said. Kerala recorded 66 dowry-related deaths between 2016 and 2020 under the category of ‘crime against women’ as per the data with the State Crime Records Bureau.

25 June 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Children in five more districts to benefit from Kaval Plus project||Buoyed by the success of the pilot project in two districts, the Department of Women and Child Development in Kerala is set to expand Kaval Plus, an ambitious programme for lending holistic support to children in need of care and protection and survivors of sexual abuse, to five more districts. Since its rollout in Thiruvananthapuram and Palakkad districts in December 2020, the project has been able to reach out to nearly 300 and 150 children respectively. Now, the project is set to be implemented in Ernakulam, Idukki, Malappuram, Kozhikode, and Kannur. “The impact of the pilot project has been very good. While it covers both children at homes and child care institutes, we are also focussing on vulnerable children in the community outside the ambit of child welfare committees (CWCs) and other agencies,” said T. V. Anupama, director, women and child development department. The 15 children’s homes in Kerala account for nearly 500 residents, leaving nearly 96% of high-risk children in need of support unprotected in the community.  Identification "We are about to introduce an early identification system using community-level workers, including Asha and Anganwadi workers," said Kavitha Manoj, State Project Coordinator of Kaval Plus. The project is being implemented with the help of NGOs experienced in working with the children. Two NGOs each are selected in each district by a committee comprising the district child protection officer, CWC representative and protection officer (non-institutional care). The chosen NGOs, however, will not work in silos but closely in association with the child protection agencies. The beneficiaries of the project are usually identified from among the children produced before CWCs who in turn will hand them to the district child protection units for social investigation as per the Juvenile Justice Act. Based on those reports, cases found fit will be handed over to Kaval Plus. "NGOs will then have to make an evaluation and draw up individual care plan for each child. We then offer children a holistic psycho-socio, economic and educational support besides family strengthening sessions and group work.

Road-Thammanam-NH bypass road that the Kerala Road Fund Board (KRFB) would develop as a four-lane corridor holds potential to be developed as Kochi’s first bus-priority corridor, to encourage public transport buses to operate along the stretch and to lessen the influx of private vehicles into the city, urban transport experts said. The four-km road whose DPR is expected to be ready in a month, is expected to considerably augment east-west connectivity in the city, by lessening distance and commuting time to the city hub and back. The DPR would contain details like the precise alignment for the 22-metre-wide road and key components like an overbridge envisaged at Kathrikadavu in order to prevent traffic snarls at the junction and space for cycle tracks on either side. The CEO of WRI India and former urban transport specialist of World Bank O.P. Agarwal said that a bus-priority corridor or a bus-rapid corridor can be readied in a road which has six lanes. In this case, the average width of the road (Thammanam-Pullepady road and its extensions to M.G. Road and NH bypass) is less than two lanes in most areas. By widening it to four lane, its width would be more than doubled by adding space, unlike in the case of a pre-existing road from where extracting a lane for buses would mean taking away space, thus reducing its width. In the case of the upcoming M.G. Road-NH bypass stretch, one lane on each side could thus be set apart as bus-priority corridor, furthering the cause of public transport, he said.  Sources in the Kerala Metropolitan Transport Authority said that it is high time buses operated through routes which hitherto had little or no public transport. “Thus, buses from passenger-dense routes like West Kochi could operate through Kundannoor bridge or the upcoming MG Road-NH bypass corridor, providing direct link to hubs like Vyttila and suburban towns like Thripunithura and Kakkanad. Mini buses too could be tried out.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mg-road-nh-bypass-stretch-could-become-first-bus-priority-corridor/article34959408.ece

The 16th century structure, which was a place of worship for the Malabari Jews, has been in a dilapidated condition for over three decades. The Archaeology Department intervened after a portion of the roof of the synagogue and its facade collapsed in 2019 owing to heavy rain. The Kerala High Court had also directed the authorities to expedite measures to acquire land. On Thursday, local residents led by M.H.M. Ashraf, councillor of the Kochi Corporation representing Kochangadi division, stopped workers engaged by the Archaeology Department from clearing the overgrown weeds at the site. A similar protest was held at the site in October last led by T.K. Ashraf, councillor representing Mattancherry division and chairman of the corporation’s Health Standing Committee, alleging that declaring the structure a protected monument will bring with it restrictions on construction around it. E. Dinesan, Director of the State Archaeology Department, clarified that there are no restrictions on construction as the department declares a monument as protected under the provisions of the Kerala Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1969. The regulations on constructions are applicable for monuments declared as protected by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), he said. Mr. Dinesan said that the installation of the temporary roof to prevent the structure from crumbling further was initiated based on requests from various quarters. The process of acquiring land was also in its final stages, he said. Mr. T.K. Ashraf said that they have nothing against protecting the site but will oppose any move to declare it as a protected monument. “Even though the authorities claim that there will be no restrictions on construction around it, our fear is that it will come in place as the chances of ASI taking over the project were high,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/efforts-to-restore-synagogue-fail-again-as-residents-protest/article34959410.ece

25 June 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||He sends women free law books on domestic violence||The recent deaths of three young women allegedly owing to dowry-related violence seems to have scarred the collective conscience of Kerala society. While social media have exploded with hashtag campaigns reflecting the anger against dowry, a store owner in Kochi has embarked on a campaign with a difference. Abdul Latheef, who has been running a popular used-books’ shop near the Ernakulam Press Club for over a decade now, has offered to give the English and Malayalam versions of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act and Rules for free. “If you feel that someone will benefit from a copy of this book, WhatsApp me on 9895648013 the person’s name, address and PIN. Neither questions nor payment will be asked,” he posted on Facebook on Wednesday evening. ‘Disturbing reports’ Mr. Latheef said that it was a small token of solidarity with women trapped in toxic relationships, including marriages. “The reports of the deaths of these women were so disturbing. It is likely to linger in the psyche of all women trapped in such relations. Why would even educated young women keep on suffering? Why don’t they just walk away,” he asks. The book costs less than Rs. 100 and is available in lawbooks shops. Mr. Latheef hopes that the initiative will do its bit in creating awareness about the law for safeguarding women. Appreciation His post has evoked appreciation from women, with some even ringing him up to share their thoughts. Two men have also messaged him requesting the book for their women acquaintances. “Women, it seems, are reluctant to reach out on their own and share their addresses and contact numbers, which are necessary for sending registered posts. Hence, they are probably seeking the help of their male friends,” Mr. Latheef said. Flak too However, it was not all appreciation alone, as a male acquaintance called him to share his displeasure about the initiative, claiming that men too were on the receiving end.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/he-sends-women-free-law-books-on-domestic-violence/article34959431.ece

25 June 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||Experts warn of copycat incidents||Extreme exposure to a singular case of suicide can spark copycat incidents and the widespread media coverage can be counterproductive, say experts. Within two days of the death of Vismaya, a 24-year-old woman in Kollam, a handful of similar cases have been reported in the State and the overwhelming reportage has been pointed out as a reason for this spurt. “Generally, persons who share the same situation of the victim will have a tendency to identify with them. Distressed ones may feel inspired to end their life and it’s a known psychological phenomenon. These are impulsive decisions triggered by an immediate stimuli,” says Harish M.T., former president, Indian Psychiatric Society, Kerala branch. A ripple effect “After Vismaya’s death, similar cases have been reported from Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Alappuzha, and Idukki. It’s a sort of ripple effect as some girls struggling with domestic abuse will see it as an ideal option,” says Thampy Mathai, Director, Maithri, a Kochi-based NGO operating a suicide-prevention helpline for 25 years. Intimate details, video clips, and pictures of the victim on social media also increase the risk factor. Mr. Mathai points out media coverage given to families committing suicide as another example. “It will appear as a sensational story the next day. After most such incidents there will be a string of similar cases,” he says. In people facing mental health issues, this overdose of information can trigger suicidal thoughts. “It’s like putting them on a poisonous diet for a few days. They will start internalising all the negativity in the reports and see suicide as a solution,” says S. Smitha, psychologist. Guidelines for reporting Though the World Health Organisation has issued guidelines for reporting suicides they are rarely followed. “The intention of the media will be good, but their over-indulgence comes with a drawback. While the stories of survivors do not get much attention, suicides are celebrated for days. They should avoid glaring headlines and graphic details at least,” she adds.  Widespread media coverage of deaths by suicide can be counterproductive||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/experts-warn-of-copycat-incidents/article34959421.ece

Budget for NSS for this fiscal||The annual Budget of the Nair Service Society (NSS) for the financial year 2021-22 envisages an income and expenditure of Rs. 132 crore. The 107th Budget of the community organisation, presented by its general secretary G. Sukumaran Nair through videoconferencing here on Thursday, expects an income of Rs. 26.25 crore from the capital sector and Rs. 105.74 crore from the revenue sector. It has also earmarked an expenditure of Rs. 45.30 crore and Rs. 86.69 crore for the capital and revenue sectors respectively. The income expected in the capital sector is through grants under the RUSA projects to colleges; library and laboratory grants; and so on. The sources in the revenue sector, meanwhile, include the NSS development fund of Rs. 17.30 crore, Rs. 10.13 crore from the plantations and Rs. 37. 59 lakh from hospitals.  Under the capital expenditure head, Rs. 12 crore has been earmarked for construction and maintenance sector, of which a major portion will be utilised for the construction of the NSS convention centre at Perunna. While Rs. 3.61 crore has been set aside for construction and maintenance of aided schools and colleges, the health sector will get a cumulative assistance of Rs. 99 lakh. The Budget also announced two new working women’s hostels at Attingal and Thrissur. Dowry prohibition Meanwhile, the meeting adopted a resolution demanding a strong implementation of the Dowry Prohibition Act with relevant amendments. “While the Act defines all valuables transacted or agreed to be transacted between the two parties engaging in a marital relationship as dowry, the valuables gifted to a couple at the time of their marriage has been excluded from this definition. This indeed serves as a loophole to those awarding huge quantity of gold at the time of weddings. Hence, the Union government should amend the Act to include the offering of gold ornaments beyond a specific limit in the scope of dowry,” read the resolution. It also called for strong implementation of the Kerala Dowry Prohibition Rules - 2004, which enables the dowry prohibition officers to prevent the offences in connection with weddings. “Though the law empowers these officials to prosecute those violating the law, these are not being implemented strictly,” it observed.

25 June 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Ayurvedic drugs may turn dear in the State||Prices of Ayurvedic drugs in Kerala could go up very soon, with the pandemic-hit manufacturers feeling the pinch of high raw material costs and a drastic fall in business. Indications of this were evident in a recent survey conducted by the Kozhikode and Wayanad district committees of the Ayurvedic Medicine Manufacturers Organisation of India (AMMOI). Around 30 members were included in it. All respondents have sought an increase in medicine prices. Sixty-one per cent of them said raw materials were not available according to their needs, and 93% said they were buying them at a higher price. The cost of production becomes higher, after adding transportation charges. “Price rise of Ayurvedic drugs may be inevitable considering these circumstances. It has been two to three years since the prices were revised in the State,” Manoj Kaloor, AMMOI functionary, said. Dr. Manoj pointed out that over 80% of the 700-odd manufacturers in Kerala operate smaller units. The pandemic, especially the second wave, had a severe impact on them. Financial aid The survey said 54% of manufacturers reported a fall in business by 50%, and others reported a loss of above 50% or 25%. None reported normal business. Around 14.3% got help from banks or other financial institutions, and some of them were due to repay the amount. As much as 61% of respondents reduced their staff. Half of the manufacturers had expected a second wave of the pandemic. Over 60% of respondents said the Drugs Control Department should chip in to help them. Right now, drugs for government Ayurveda hospitals are being purchased from the State-owned Oushadhi. The manufacturers urged the government to buy medicines from other manufacturers as well. The government should also take steps to make available quality raw materials at a low rate. Dr. Manoj said a detailed survey involving more respondents across the State would be held soon. The manufacturers have also sought the setting up of a commission to study the problems facing the sector.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ayurvedic-drugs-may-turn-dearer/article34959392.ece

Overcrowded fish markets and wayside outlets cut a sorry figure on Thursday with long queues in front of them. A fish market near Nadakkavu even drew the attention of passers-by with a long queue of buyers. There was no one to enforce rules there. A few customers even justified the act. Though regulations are in force in critical containment zones, many came out of restricted areas and moved around. The police and other enforcement squads found themselves helpless in the face of the heavy turnout. Even children casually roamed with parents. “Very few taxi drivers complied with the district administration’s orders to limit the number of passengers in vehicles. As regards private vehicle owners, there was no self-regulation at all,” said a Rapid Response Team volunteer from West Hill. He added that the city roads remained crowded with the rise in non-emergency trips. A shop owner at CSI Junction said customers were lax in using hand sanitisers. Meanwhile, sources in the Health Department said sectoral magistrates appointed by the district administration had been asked to tighten checking. They added that the district administration was closely monitoring the situation, and that more curbs would be considered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kozhikode-witnesses-heavy-rush-in-public-places-markets/article34959395.ece
25 June 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Gold smuggling thrives through Calicut airport||Despite stringent action and surveillance, the Calicut International Airport has continued to be a conduit for smuggling gold even during the COVID-19-imposed flight restrictions. Sources said that the latest incident involving the Ramanattukara accident and the seizures of gold at the airport revealed that Dubai -based syndicates operated the intricate gold smuggling ring through a network across north Kerala. Gold smugglers with well-trenched moles get political patronage as well. "And this is not an unknown secret. Significantly smuggling syndicates have been operating in Mangalore and Kannur airports," officials said. On Monday, the Air Intelligence Unit of the Customs had seized 2.33 kg of gold worth Rs. 1.11 crore from Muhammad Shafeeque Melethil of Moorkkanad in Malappuram district. The gold was concealed inside a new coffee maker machine. Incidentally, the Customs officers, along with officials of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, had also made two seizures of gold weighing 4.8 kg and 2.47 kg totally worth Rs. 2.95 crore on Sunday. Nearly 138 kgs of gold was seized and 287 cases were registered in 2020. This year till June 15, the gold seized was 80 kg. About 60 cases were registered in connection with these seizures. As per rules, a passenger would be arrested if the value of the gold kept in possession was above Rs. 20 lakh, officials said. The sources said that the smuggling of gold thrived whether the policies on import duties changed or not. In 2019, the Centre raised import duty on gold to 12.55% from 10% but in February this year, the import duty was slashed to 7.5 % but imposed a 2.5 % cess that would effectively attract 10.75% tax. "Even then, a profit of Rs. 4.5-5 lakh can be made for a kg of gold smuggled into the country,” the sources said. Racketeers engage carriers individually or those flying in groups to smuggle gold. It is revealed that agents or carriers employ innovative methods to bring in contraband from abroad. “About 60% of the gold seized are in compound form,” an official said. From hiding the gold in specially designed clothes to tampered electronic devices, cutlery and footwear, carriers now resort to concealing gold pieces inside the rectum. To slip by Customs, carriers use the green channel and take drugs to circumvent visible symptoms when concealing the gold inside the rectum. Usually, eyes can become swollen and cause redness due to this, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/gold-smuggling-thrives-through-calicut-airport/article34959391.ece

This had become a vital cog in accreditation process of colleges, he said while inaugurating an online symposium on the National Assessment and Accreditation Council-accreditation process organised by the Loyola College of Social Sciences here on Thursday. Besides emphasising the role of technology-enhanced digital learning in the context of accreditation, Mr. Gurukkal said the accreditation process would hinge on the extent of networking within the campus as well as the use of customised, open-source learning management systems such as MOODLE. Higher education institutions should strive to transform themselves as entrepreneurial institutions with automated systems for recording student-teacher activities. ‘Be innovative’ The academician urged teachers to be mavericks who adopted an innovative and creative attitude towards technological advancements in pedagogy, even while striving to preserve quality.

Vehicles used by many of such sightseers have been impounded by squads. According to the Kozhikode Rural Police, many of those who were booked for the offence were unaware of the regulations. For them, the easing of lockdown regulations is seemingly a green signal for merriments in public places, the police said. Personnel from the Thamarassery police station said they were surprised to find as many as 18 motorbikes near a hill tourism destination at Amarad near Kattippara recently. Though the riders fled on seeing checking squads, all the vehicles were impounded and taken to the police station, they added. The unguarded eco-tourism spots at Vilangad and Nadapuram are also seeing an unhealthy rush of visitors. A number of unchecked interior roads turn safe routes for them. Since local tourism entrepreneurs are out of business following the COVID-19 outbreak, local vigil is on the decline. Station House Officers from rural stations said they had alerted the Tourism Department and local administrators to adopt stringent measures to discourage the trend. They made it clear that local people’s support would be sought to gather information about trespassers. A local body member from Nadapuram said there were incidents in which reckless sightseers were trapped in the middle of rivers following flash floods. “Recently, five youths had a narrow escape while bathing in the river near the Janakikadu eco-tourism spot,” he said. The Valayam police said the Thirikakkayam waterfalls near Vilangad attract youngsters. Over 15 persons were booked till Thursday, apart from impounding 12 vehicles, they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/police-patrol-ramped-up-as-people-throw-caution-to-wind/article34959393.ece

25 June 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||HC grants relief to Twitter India chief||In a temporary relief to Twitter India’s Managing Director Manish Maheshwari, the High Court of Karnataka on Thursday restrained the Uttar Pradesh police fromtaking any coercive action against him till June 29 on a criminal case related to the Ghaziabad incident of uploading a video related to assault on an elderly Muslim man. However, the court said the Loni Border police could question Mr. Maheshwari, who is residing in Bengaluru, through virtual mode till it decided the legal question of whether the High Court of Karnataka had the jurisdiction to entertain challenge to the notice issued by the Uttar Pradesh police. Justice G. Narendar passed the interim order on a petition filed by Mr. Maheshwari questioning the notice by the Loni Border police on June 18 asking him to join the investigation after he replied to their earlier notice indicating that he was prepared to cooperate with the investigation through videoconference. Earlier, Senior Advocate C.V. Nagesh had contended that Mr. Maheshwari was only an employee of Twitter Communications India Pvt Ltd., looking after marketing and sales and had nothing to do with the process of uploading of content, as it was controlled by Twitter Inc, U.S. It was also contended that though Mr. Maheshwari had been designated as Managing Director, he was neither the director nor a member of the Board of Directors as per the Companies Act, 2013, for holding him responsible on behalf of the company, which had been made as an accused in the First information Report. Mr. Nagesh pointed out that the Uttar Pradesh police on June 17 issued notice through email under Section 160 of Code of Criminal Procedure, which in law meant that they wanted his statement as a witness. Mr. Maheshwari on June 18 replied that he would be available to record statement through virtual mode. On June 21, Mr. Nagesh said, the Uttar Pradesh police issued a notice through e-mail under Section 41A of the Cr.PC, which meant that the police were now treating Mr. Maheshwari as an accused. It was also pointed out to the court that Mr. Maheshwari had not been arraigned as an accused individually in the FIR. Not allowing him to appear through virtual mode during the current situation was contrary to the apex court’s directions, Mr. Nagesh contended. However, advocate P. Prasanna Kumar, appearing for the Uttar Pradesh police, raised a preliminary objection stating that the petitioner could not invoke the jurisdiction of the High Court of Karnataka in view of Article 226(2) of the Constitution. Though the petitioner claimed to be a resident of Bengaluru city, in the email notice issued to him, the Uttar Pradesh police had mentioned his address as Mumbai, the counsel for Uttar Pradesh police said.  Six individuals, including journalists, Twitter, the news website The Wire, were among the nine accused named in the FIR by the Loni Border police over uploading and circulation of a video in which the elderly man, Abdul Shamad Saifi, claimed that he was allegedly thrashed by some young men after compelling him to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’ . The police claimed that the video was shared to cause communal unrest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hc-grants-relief-to-twitter-india-chief/article34959105.ece

The nodal officer had informed her of the order issued by the Disaster Management Authority (DMA), the sole exception being that she could appear before the investigating officer for interrogation. However, she travelled with a few others on a vehicle to reach the police headquarters for interrogation. Later, she mingled with people and visited the panchayat office and held discussions with many people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/aisha-sultana-violated-covid-norms-kerala-hc-told/article34959108.ece
25 June 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Filmmaker may return to Kochi||Model and filmmaker Aisha Sultana, who appeared before the Lakshadweep police for questioning in a sedition case over the week, is likely to return to Kochi on Saturday or Sunday. Akbar Kareem, her lawyer, told The Hindu on Thursday that Ms. Sultana, a resident of Kochi and a native of Chetlat island, was questioned by the police on June 20, 23 and 24 in connection with a case under Sections 124(A) and 153 (B) — sedition and assertions against national integration — of the Indian Penal Code. A case was registered against Aisha Sultana following a complaint made by Bharatiya Janata Party Lakshadweep unit president Abdul Khader against a statement made by her on the COVID-19 situation in the Union Territory during a news television debate early this month. Mr. Kareem, who accompanied Ms. Sultana to Kavaratti, said the police examined her social media accounts and connections, including if she had any links with any foreigner or an international grouping. “She has none,” he maintained. Meanwhile, Sharat Kumar Sinha, Superindent of Police at Kavaratti, said the investigation in the case was in progress and the interrogation was a part of it. He did not comment if the interrogation was over and at what stage the investigation had reached. While the Kerala High Court had granted her anticipatory interim bail in the case, District Collector of Lakshadweep Asker Ali the other day issued her a warning, accusing her of flouting COVID-19 standard protocol prevalent in the Union Territory.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/filmmaker-may-return-to-kochi/article34959109.ece
25 June 2021||KOLLAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Kerala women’s panel chief’s ‘you suffer’ remark draws flak||State Women’s Commission chairperson M.C. Josephine on Thursday issued a statement expressing remorse over her comment in a channel programme that drew widespread criticism. The video clip of a seemingly annoyed Ms. Josephine snapping at a victim of domestic violence and asking her to “suffer” if she could not file a police complaint had created much resentment, with many demanding her resignation. Her rude remark to a distressed woman, who seemed a little hesitant to open up, also generated a volley of trolls on social media. When the woman said she was being abused by her husband and her mother-in-law, the chairperson asked if she had approached the police. The Ernakulam resident revealed she had not shared it with anyone and Ms. Josephine retorted with a curt “then you suffer.” Many prominent persons termed her behaviour arrogant and demanded a more humane person as her replacement. Ms. Josephine said that her hard tone was due to the issues in audio quality and she had only taken a mother’s freedom with the woman. “It was my self-indignation over girls failing to come forward bravely with complaints, but on second thoughts I felt I could have avoided that comment. If my words have hurt her, I express regret,” she said. She said that she was clueless about the format of the programme. “I had tried to avoid that programme due to my busy schedule and health issues. I decided to go when they told me my response was necessary and the subject was dowry-related. Only after reaching there, I came to know that it was a call-in programme,” she said. KPCC demand In Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president K. Sudhakaran slammed Ms. Josephine for slighting a victim of domestic violence. He said the woman had called Ms. Josephine as a last resort. However, the chairperson had slighted her. Mr. Sudhakaran demanded that Ms. Josephine resign. He said the government’s women helpline would offer no solace to victims, if Ms. Josephine’s reaction was any indication.  I had only taken a mother’s freedom with the woman M.C.

25 June 2021||NEW DELHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||SC refuses to intervene in Kerala students’ plea||The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to intervene in a petition filed by students to cancel Class 11 exams in Kerala due to the pandemic and evaluate marks via an internal assessment scheme. A Bench of Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari gave the students liberty to approach the Kerala High Court with their plea. Advocate G. Prakash, for Kerala, said Class 11 exams were scheduled in September. The marks were not relevant for college admissions in 2021. They would only be considered in 2022, when they are combined with the Class 12 marks. Mr. Prakash said Kerala had already conducted the Class 12 examinations in April. Advocate Prashant Padmanabhan, appearing for the students, said holding Class 11 exams in September as planned or later depending on the COVID-19 situation would put students under unnecessary pressure. It would interfere with their studies and preparation for the Class 12 exams, which would start from March 2022. The court, at this point, asked Kerala whether they would give students time — 15 days to a month — to prepare for their Class 11 exams. Mr. Prakash orally said the State would be willing to do so. However, Mr. Padmanabhan said students would need at least three months to prepare. But the court finally decided not to intervene, saying it had wanted to help but would not like to delve into the issue of Class 11 exams any further.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sc-refuses-to-intervene-in-kerala-students-plea/article34959103.ece

He symbolically tilled a piece of land and patted, among others, farmer leaders V.V. Prasad, Pothula Narasimha Rao and P. Bhadri Reddy for organising the traditional cultural practice to mark the commencement of kharif cultivation. Tobacco Board Executive Director A. Sridhar Babu noted that the market prices for the bright and medium grade varieties were up to the mark, and promised to take up with the traders the growers’ demand for better price for the low-grade varieties.

Ranga Rao while leading a protest here on Thursday. “The past seven months during which 520 protesting farmers have died reminds us the period of the Emergency 46 years ago,” he added. During the coronavirus pandemic, while the other sectors slumped, farmers risked their lives and achieved a record farm production, All India Kisan Sabha district secretary Vadde Hanuma Reddy pointed out, adding that the Centre had forced the three farm laws upon the farmers which would be taken away farming from their hands, only to be handed over to coroporates. Farmers’ suicide Referring to the spate of farmer’ suicides, Andhra Pradesh Rythu Sangam district president P.

25 June 2021||RAJAMAHENDRAVARAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Six airports in A.P. may be privatised, says MP||Member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism, and Culture Margani Bharat on Thursday stated that the proposed Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (Amendment) Bill, 2021, was primarily intended to privatise the loss-making airports under the Airports Authority of India (AAI). Speaking at the meeting chaired by Standing Committee Chairman and MP T.G. Venkatesh in New Delhi, Mr. Bharat said, “The airports, including Vijayawada and Tirupati, will be privatised with the amendment. How can these two airports be privatised after investing nearly Rs. 950 crore on their modernisation and expansion?” “The amendment will enable privatisation of six loss-making airports in Andhra Pradesh by handing them over to the private players either through bunching or pairing after the Bill becomes an Act,” Mr. Bharat, who is Rajamahendravaram MP, said. “In Gujarat, nine airports, including the ones at Surat, Vadodara, and Rajkot, have reported losses. I do not think that there will be any move to privatise these airports. Strengthening the AAI appears to be a robust solution to register better results,” said Mr. Bharat. He further said that the Bill was against the guidelines of NITI Aayog, which mandates that not more than two airports should be given to the private developer in any State. “The idea of bundling the airports and handing them over to the private players will also be against the existing policies of the AAI and the Government of India,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/six-airports-in-ap-may-be-privatised-says-mp/article34959577.ece

25 June 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||CBI opens criminal inquiry in ISRO frame-up case||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has opened a criminal inquiry against a set of former law enforcement officials responsible for the police frame-up that led to the wrongful arrest, custodial torture and unjustified incarceration of Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) scientist Nambi Narayanan and others in 1994. Last month, the CBI had filed a First Information Report (FIR) marked as classified in the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate (Thiruvananthapuram) R. Rekha.  The FIR named Siby Mathews, who then headed the “ISRO Spy Case” Special Investigation Team (SIT), his deputies K.K. Joshua, and S. Vijayan and Thampi S. Durgadutt, and the then Deputy Director, Intelligence Bureau, R.B. Sreekumar as accused in the case initiated by the Supreme Court. The accused are now retired. SC order The Supreme Court (SC) had in 2018 ordered the Kerala government to pay Mr. Narayanan a compensation of Rs. 50 lakh for ruining his life and reputation. The apex court had also constituted a three-member committee under jurist D. K. Jain to identify those responsible for the wrongful incarceration of Mr. Narayanan. In April, the Union government requested the apex court to take cognisance of the Jain committee report and initiate suitable action. Consequently, it forwarded the judicial panel’s findings to the CBI stating that they were grave and merited a thorough investigation. The case The controversial page in the history of the police investigation and criminal prosecution in Kerala commenced with the arrest of two Maldivian women on the charge of overstay and infringement of the Official Secrets Act in Thiruvananthapuram in November 1994. Soon, the police arrested two ISRO scientists, Mr. Narayanan and D. Sasikumaran, along with two others. The Kerala Police claimed that the women were spies of a foreign power. They alleged that the foreign agents had entrapped the scientists into parting with secret space technology. The CBI took over the case in December 1994. It closed the case for want of evidence. The SC upheld the closure report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cbi-opens-criminal-inquiry-in-isro-frame-up-case/article34959112.ece

25 June 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Group-I Mains: APPSC member denies irregularities in selection of candidates||The selection of candidates in Group-I Mains examination was done in a transparent way, scrupulously following the rule book, said Shaik Salam Babu, member of the Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission (APPSC), here on Thursday. Addressing the media, Mr. Salam Babu dismissed as baseless the allegations of irregularities in the process being made against the APPSC, and said they only brought disrepute to the credibility of the commission. Referring to the allegation that 70 candidates had been selected under sports quota, he said there was no truth in it. Candidates of all the categories were given equal opportunities and the choice of language. He said the candidates were asked to upload their sports certificates, and first priority was given to a gold medal in the Olympics. The certificates were then ratified by the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh (SAAP). Speaking about the alleged exchange of booklets by the candidates at the examination centres in places such as Kakinada and Srikakulam, the commission member sought to clarify that as per the norms, damaged booklets were replaced with the buffer booklets. There was also no truth in reports that there were loopholes in digital valuation of the papers, Mr. Babu said, informing that the commission had closely studied the various aspects of digital valuation being followed in other States for two months and only after it was convinced that it was a fool-proof system, it decided to go ahead and implement it in the State. Replying to a query, Mr. Babu said the commission had discretionary powers to change the ratio of the selection of candidates. He said the result would always depend on the candidates’ efficiency and the exam pattern. “There have been cases of candidates who could not succeed in Group-III, but who cracked the Group-I exam and vice-versa,” he added. “The commission has been functioning in a most transparent way and it will always be ready to clarify doubts, if any. However, the norms do not allow revaluation of answer sheets,” he clarified. Job calendar Referring to the demand that the number of posts be increased in the job calendar released recently, Mr. Babu said since the commission did not have the power to do it, it had taken the issue to the notice of the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/group-i-mains-appsc-member-denies-irregularities-in-selection-of-candidates/article34959582.ece
25 June 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Five-member gang, which killed six senior citizens, arrested||The Penamaluru police arrested a five-member gang, which allegedly murdered six persons, and looted their houses. The accused reportedly planned the murders during the pandemic, as the victims’ family members would not get any doubt on their deaths. The police had picked up two persons as part of investigation into a case of attempt to loot an ATM at Poranki Centre. Based on the confessions of the suspects, they took into custody three more persons and during questioning, the accused reportedly confessed to the killings. The arrested were identified as V. Prabhu Kumar, S. Gopi Raju, P, Chakravarthy and M. Naga Durga Rao, all auto drivers, and M. Phaneendra Kumar, a painter.

They also allegedly killed a couple Nageswara Rao (85) and Prameela Rani (75) of Kanchikacherla in Krishna district in December. The accused allegedly killed Dhanalakshmi (58) of Tadigadapa in January this year, and Papamma on the city outskirts a few days ago, said Police Commissioner B. Srinivasulu at a press conference on Thursday. Modus operandi The modus operandi of the gang was to conduct ‘recce’ during day time, identify senior citizens and kill them during night. The gang reportedly entered the houses by opening the latches from outside, killed the victims by smothering them and escaped with gold and cash, Mr. Srinivasulu said. “Of the total six murders, only one case has been registered with the police and in other incidents their family members did not lodge complaints assuming that they died of COVID-19,” said Central Zone Assistant Commissioner of Police Y. Srinivas Reddy. “The gang conducted ‘recce’ in Tenali and Mangalagiri in Guntur district and in Vuyyuru, Kankipadu and Penamaluru on Vijayawada outskirts and planned to kill 12 more persons and loot their houses. Had the gang is not arrested now, they would have executed their plans,” said Penamaluru CI M. Satyanarayana. Besides, the gang allegedly committed thefts in many houses in the last 10 months.

25 June 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Power to regulate minor ports should be with the States, asserts Mekapati||Industries and Commerce Minister Mekapati Goutham Reddy has suggested that the States’ Maritime Boards should be vested with the powers of a Maritime Port Regulatory Authority (MPRA) as in the case of major ports. Participating in the Maritime States’ Development Council meeting held virtually on Thursday, he pointed out that the draft Indian Ports Bill, 2020, provides for the constitution of a single MPRA for all the minor ports, whereas there were 13 regulatory authorities for as many major ports under the Major Ports Regulatory Authority Act, 2020. “This is discriminatory,” he stated. Mr. Goutham Reddy said the legal department of Government of Andhra Pradesh was still reviewing the Bill, and that the regulation of minor ports could not be done by the Centre. The power to regulate the minor ports should be with the States as the subject fell in the Concurrent List. ‘Exempt existing facilities’ If the Central government intended to proceed to enact the Bill in spite of the objections raised by the States, it should consider exempting the existing operational ports and the ports under construction in the maritime States, Mr. Goutham Reddy appealed. The Minister further said that A.P. was developing three ports at Bhavanapadu, Machilipatnam and Ramayapatnam to realise the State’s potential for growth in the maritime sector. Besides, emphasis was laid on the development of the fisheries sector in which A.P. was ranked first in the country with a 24% share in the national production. A.P. contributes 1.61% of the global production. He said A.P. was looking forward to better road and rail connectivity to the seaports at Gangavaram, Krishnapatnam and Kakinada, and it was thankful to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways for sanctioning 32 road projects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/power-to-regulate-minor-ports-should-be-with-the-states-asserts-mekapati/article34959588.ece

25 June 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||JC to oversee process to select mutt pontiff||The Andhra Pradesh Dharmika Parishad, an autonomous body under the Endowments Department, has appointed Endowments joint commissioner Chandrasekhar Azad as the special officer to oversee the process to select the pontiff of the Brahmamgari mutt in Kadapa district. Endowments Minister Velampalli Srinivas Rao, on Thursday, said the parishad was asked to take necessary steps and resolve the issue at the earliest. Further, the parishad was asked to convene a meeting with seers and pontiffs to look into the matter and suggest a way out, he said. Endowments Department special commissioner and member secretary of the parishad P. Arjun Rao issued orders in this regard. After the erstwhile pontiff of the mutt Sri Veerabhoga Vasanta Venkateswara Swamy passed away last month, a dispute arose over his successor. It was said that the erstwhile pontiff had chosen his successor and wrote a will. But trouble broke out as the families of his first and second wives wanted a person from their respective lineage to be declared as the next successor of the mutt. Some Hindu spiritual leaders tried to resolve the deadlock amicably but in vain as both families refused to concede and held on to their respective demands.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jc-to-oversee-process-to-select-mutt-pontiff/article34959146.ece

Seventeen other PSA plants were in various stages of establishment. Submitting to the court a memo having details of the COVID-19 containment measures, the government said while the Centre would take care of the civil works and equipment, the electrical, generator and connection works were to be taken up by the State. Of the more than 17 sites identified, the State was yet to receive the PSA plants from the Centre for 12 locations. In the remaining five sites, plants had been received and the State was completing the other works. Regarding Mucormycosis (black fungus) cases, the government apprised the court that their number stood at 3,087 as on Wednesday, of which 1,327 had been cured and the patients discharged. There had been 232 deaths till date and 1,528 patients were undergoing treatment for the infections. Out of them, 697 were on Amphotericin-B injections, 495 on Posaconazole injections and 802 on Posaconazole tablets.

25 June 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Black fungus won’t be fatal if diagnosed in time, say doctors||The number of mucormycosis (black fungus) cases in Visakhapatnam are growing steadily even as the COVID-19 curve is on the downward trend. There are bright chances of recovery from the fungal infection if the symptoms are diagnosed and treated early. On an average, five new cares are being reported in the city every day. Symptoms like facial pain, blurring of vision, cheek pain, changes in skin colour and loosening of teeth in patients who have recovered from COVID-19 could be an early warning sign of mucormycosis. The special ward, opened at KGH nearly a month ago and the one at ENT Hospital, opened two weeks ago. A few notified private hospitals are also treating black fungus cases. “The second variant of COVID-19 has targeted the nasal defence system besides lowering immunity in patients. In addition to this, prolonged use of steroids, uncontrolled diabetes and other pre-existing conditions lead to an abnormal rise in mucormycosis cases,” says Dr. B. Ramachandra Rao, an Associate Professor at the Government ENT Hospital. “Though other medical specialties like ophthalmology and neurosurgery are also involved, ENT surgeons play a major role in the treatment. The fungus finds easy prey in those with low immunity levels, due to long-term steroid use for treatment of COVID-19, and those with uncontrolled diabetes. When there is eye intervention, the patients are referred to the special ward in KGH, where a full-fledged team is available,” says Dr. Ramachandra Rao. The very first mucormycosis surgery at the special ward in KGH was done on May 29. The fungus entered the maxillary sinus, from there to the eye and emerged out through the skin on to the cheek. Dr. P.V. Sudhakar, plastic surgeon and principal of Andhra Medical College, led the team, which successfully performed the surgery. Dr. Bharathi (plastic surgeon), Dr. M.V. Vijayshekar (neurosurgeon), Dr. M. Veer Kumar and Dr. Sudha (ENT) and Dr. Allu Padmaja (anaesthetist) were the other team members. “So far, over 70 mucormycosis surgeries have been performed at KGH and a majority of the patients responded well to the treatment. Some patients were brought to the Casualty ward with gasping and in such acute cases, fatalities are higher. Some patients are referred to KGH, after surgery at private hospitals, as those hospitals do not have adequate supply of antifungal drugs,” Dr. Vijayshekar says. Amphotericin-B costs Rs. 7,000 a vial and a patient has to be given six injections a day. Posaconazole costs Rs. 600 for each tablet and a patient has to be given three tablets a day. All these are being given free of cost at KGH,” says Dr. Vijayshekar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/black-fungus-wont-be-fatal-if-diagnosed-in-time-say-doctors/article34959592.ece
25 June 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Many tribal families wrongfully denied ration card in five ITDA limits: study||Gangulamma, a resident of Pinalovasingi in Luvasingi panchayat of G. Madugula mandal in the Visakhapatnam Agency, is a senior citizen and physically challenged too, as she lost both her legs during her childhood. She has no Aadhaar card, and hence not entitled for ration card, pension or, for that matter, any social welfare benefit. Her hamlet has considerable presence of the banned CPI (Maoist) and is not connected by any form of road. Arduous task To obtain an Aadhaar card, the residents of Pinalovasingi have to trek up two hills, cross a crocodile-infested stream to reach Balapam, and then travel 80-km to the nearest Aadhaar centre in Paderu. Given her age and physical condition, Gangulamma has to be carried all the way to the Aadhaar centre, a journey she cannot endure. The case of Vantala Balanna, a member of the Kondh tribe, a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG), is different. He has been denied ration card as he has failed the six-step validation process, one of which shows that he owns a four-wheeler. Balanna hails from a hamlet, an interior area of Paderu, that is not connected by any form of road. The village volunteers and other residents of the hamlet testify that he does not own a four-wheeler. “To correct the anomaly, Balanna has to go to the Road Transport Department in Visakhapatnam city, which is a Herculean task for him given his financial status,” say the village secretariat staff. These instances have come to light in a survey conducted by a team of LibTech India, a non-profit organisation, in the five ITDA limits of North Coastal Andhra Pradesh. The survey has come to the conclusion that many tribal families, ranging from 7,000 to 35,000, may have been wrongfully denied ration cards in these ITDAs, mainly due to the anomalies in the validation process. Glaring mismatch As per the Nava Sakham Survey of the State government, in the 28 tribal mandals across the five ITDAs, the number of families enumerated is around 3.86 lakh, but the number of ration cards issued is around 3.5 lakh, which indicates that more than 35,000 families have been excluded, says Chakradhar of LibTech India. Moreover, as per the 2019 database, the number of ration cards as on December 2019 in the mandals was 3.68 lakh. In March 2021, the number dipped to 3.6 lakh. “That is why, we can say that about 7,000 to 35,000 tribal families may have been wrongfully denied ration cards,” says Mr. Chakradhar. The LibTech team has interviewed over 50 village volunteers, digital assistants and CSO workers, who have confirmed the anomaly in the validation process. “The six-step process is cumbersome for the innocent and uneducated tribal people. It has to be disbanded in the tribal areas. Instead, the village volunteers may be asked to identify the families that do not have ration cards and issue the same to them as many still do not have access to Aadhaar,” says Mr. Chakradhar. According to him, in many tribal homes, two or more families live together, but only one ration card is provided, which does not serve the purpose. Timely help “Providing ration to the families excluded will not burden the State exchequer much. It should be considered at least for the next six months till the COVID-19 pandemic subsides,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/many-tribal-families-wrongfully-denied-ration-card-in-five-itda-limits-study/article34959575.ece

25 June 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Imerys launches sales from city||Imerys, a company that specialises in providing mineral-based specialty solutions to industries, announced the commencement of commercial sales of its new Calcium Aluminate plant, here on Thursday. It was commissioned remotely from Lyon, France. Imerys has invested Rs. 350 crore to set up the plant in Visakhapatnam and employs around 100 local, who have been trained in operation of the plant. The setting up of the plant will enable the company to serve domestic customers with products adapted to their local needs. This is being said to be a rare FDI in Andhra Pradesh since the onset of the pandemic. The new plant will supply to the refractory as well as the construction market with SECAR 70V, a calcium aluminate binder with controlled chemistry and optimised mineralogy for conventional castable applications, and SECAR 68V, a calcium aluminate binder dedicated to growing demand in low-cement castables. These products have been developed by Imerys scientists to meet the specific needs of the Indian refractory and construction industries and adapted to the climate of the sub-continent. The plant will also serve as a distribution centre of imported ready-to-use mortars and bentonite solutions to serve the fast-growing infrastructure sector. The city was chosen due to its access to the port. Imerys India today employs around 800 people, located in 16 industrial sites and eight sales offices. In addition to the production of calcium aluminate binders, the Group produces specialty solutions for ceramics, plastics, polymers and refractory products. “The opening of this new plant is a major milestone for Imerys. It is another proof that the Group continues to invest in growing markets and geographies, said Alessandro Dazza, Imerys Chief Executive Officer. Imerys, an MNC, deals with mineral-based specialty solutions for industry, with 3.8 billion Euro revenue and has around 16,400 employees globally.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/imerys-launches-sales-from-city/article34959600.ece

25 June 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Long stretches of roads are still in disrepair||As the monsoon sets in, long stretches of roads are still in a state of disrepair in Hyderabad affecting traffic flow and creating potential danger zones during heavy rains. Traffic is reduced to a crawl through the day during peak hours. The evening peak hour, with almost every establishment shutting down, is a test of patience, skill and auditory threshold. “It took me 31 minutes to deliver an order from Banjara Hills to Hyderguda, a distance of 6.5 km. Usually it takes only 12 to 14 minutes,” said Md Khaleel Baig, a food-delivery executive about the evening rush hour. “It is because of the PVNR Expressway we could reach home in 45 minutes. We are no longer able to use the Masab Tank flyover as it is packed through the day,” said another regular commuter about the traffic on the Jyothi Nagar-Rythu Bazaar stretch of road. Even at 7.15 on Thursday evening, large stretches of roads were in the red on real time online traffic maps. Near Raidurgam police station, it is the electricity department that has dug up a trench creating a block to traffic flowing towards Biodiversity Junction. Below the PVNR Expressway there is a gas pipeline company that has dug up trenches to lay a pipeline. The work had been going on from the beginning of summer and shows no end in sight. At Toli Chowki near Sabza Colony, the location of annual flooding in the western part of Hyderabad, the road has been dug up on one side for drinking water pipeline. “This drinking water pipeline work will get done in three days,” says the supervisor at the site near Toli Chowki about the 1400-mm pipeline. The work has been going on for the past few weeks and before that, box girders were laid by another utility. In Nalanda Nagar, the road has been dug up for laying a sewerage line. In Banjara Hills, near a well-known mall, work is in full swing on a foot-over-bridge. While the FOB might become very useful in future, currently motorists can see the massive crater that has been there for the past two months. Beside the Biodiversity Junction flyover, sewage flows on the road. What is likely to happen once it rains is easy to figure out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/long-stretches-of-roads-are-still-in-disrepair/article34959376.ece

25 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Fathullaguda waste plant launch today||City’s second treatment and processing plant for recycling of construction and demolition waste is all ready for inauguration at Fathullaguda of Nagole on Friday. Minister for Municipal Administration & Urban Development K.T.Rama Rao will launch the plant at an event presided by the Mayor Gadwal Vijayalakshmi amid a posse of other colleagues and dignitaries. The first such plant had already been launched by the Minister at Jeedimetla last November. It earned fame as the biggest C&D waste treatment plant in South India and fifth biggest in the whole country, GHMC claimed through a press statement. Other than Hyderabad, C&D waste treatment plants exist in New Delhi, Ahmedabad, Surat and Visakhapatnam The plant at Fathullaguda is equipped to treat 500 metric tonnes of debris per day. Thanks to the use of wet processing technology, the plant will not emanate any dust or pollutants, the note said. C&D waste can be used in its raw form as low level filling, and sub-base for road construction. Further processing of the debris could yield products such as sand, recycled bricks, paver blocks, parking tiles and footpath tiles. Construction debris to the tune of 13.35 lakh metric tonnes has been collected and dumped near Jeedimetla plant since April, 2018, while the Fathullaguda plant already has 7.97 lakh metric tonnes of accumulated waste for processing. It is estimated that the city generates over 2,000 tonnes of C&D waste per day, which was earlier being dumped recklessly on the roadside and in lakes. GHMC has organised special vehicles to collect such waste upon payment of Rs. 342 per metric tonne, so that it can be scientifically disposed of at the treatment plants, the note said. Proposals are pending for establishment of more such plants on all corners of the city, to ease the logistics. Kotwalguda of Shamshabad is one more location where another plant is being mulled.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/fathullaguda-waste-plant-launch-today/article34959377.ece

25 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Long queues due to reduced carrying capacity, says DMRC||Following long queues outside several metro stations since the resumption of services, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Thursday said that the current frequency of trains is similar to pre-pandemic times. The public transporter attributed the long queues to reduced carrying capacity of the Delhi Metro network due to government guidelines. Metro services resumed on June 7 after a hiatus of nearly a month due to the COVID-19-induced lockdown. Guidelines issued by the Delhi government stated that the metro can run only at a 50% capacity. Single-entry points DMRC spokesperson Anuj Dayal said, “The long queues are caused as only single-entry points are permitted at most of the metro stations, as in a mass transit system it is difficult to regulate the number of persons inside the system once entry is permitted. At present, the carrying capacity of the Delhi Metro as per existing guidelines is in the range of 10%-15% only.” The DMRC also said that 5,100 train trips were being run every day with a frequency of 2.5 minutes to 5 minutes on all major corridors. “This was the same frequency at which metro was operating during the normal pre-COVID times. The metro is thus, operating and running at its full frequency or capacity but with reduced carrying capacity owing to restrictions,” it said. According to government guidelines, passengers are required to sit on alternate seats and are not permitted to stand inside the metro coaches. The restrictions have resulted in each coach carrying approximately 25 passengers as opposed to the 300 it could accommodate without restrictions.  The long queues are caused as only single-entry points are permitted at most of the metro stations Anuj Dayal DMRC spokesperson||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/long-queues-due-to-reduced-carrying-capacity-says-dmrc/article34959302.ece
25 June 2021||New Delhi,||HC issues notice to Centre on harassment complaint by officer||The Delhi High Court has issued notice to the Centre on a petition by a senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, who has complained of sexual harassment against the Director General of the Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D), claiming that the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) in her case was not properly constituted. Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani also issued notice to BPR&D while posting the case for further hearing on June 25. In the meantime, the High Court asked if the parties involved, being very senior officers of a uniformed force, could attempt to resolve the issue on their own. Proceedings under way The High Court’s direction came on a plea by the senior IPS officer who said proceedings in her complaint are under way before the ICC constituted by BPR&D. Senior advocate Rebecca John, representing the senior IPS officer, argued that the petition was only concerned with the constitution of the members of the ICC, which was constituted by an order of May 21, this year. ICC members Ms. John contened that members of the ICC are subordinate in rank to the Director General against whom the sexual harassment complaint has been made. This, Ms. John submitted, was in the teeth of a verdict of judgments of the High Court. She explained that an internal complaints committee must not comprise members who are subordinate in rank to the person who is subject matter of the complaintbefore such committee. “This, it is submitted, vitiates the very constitution of the ICC and all proceedings being conducted before it; and is against the principles of justice and fair play,” Ms. John argued. In the meantime, Centre’s counsel Monika Arora suggested that considering that both the complainant and the person against whom ICC proceedings are pending, are very senior officers of a uniformed force, an attempt be made to resolve the issues that have arisen. Ms. John also did not oppose the suggestion. “Accordingly, counsel may attempt resolution of the matter, if possible; and report on the next date of hearing,” JusticeBhambhani said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-issues-notice-to-centre-on-harassment-complaint-by-officer/article34959296.ece

The lawyer representing the PMC said that there is no such proposal for additional garbage processing and assured through a statement that no fresh dumping of waste was taking place at the current site, which has already been bio-mined. The tribunal observed that as the PMC had already exceeded its stipulated time for clearing the site, it was liable to pay compensation for continued violation for “not clearing the legacy waste in the given time limit and in accordance with the statutory norms”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ngt-raps-pmc-over-waste-disposal-in-twin-villages/article34959324.ece
25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||The rise, fall and death of an antivirus software pioneer||Seventy-five-year-old John McAfee, the creator of the McAfee antivirus software who allegedly killed himself in a Spanish prison on Wednesday, called himself an iconoclast. His run-ins with governments saw him don the life of fugitive many a time in the final years of his life. In between all the running away, he found his political expression in the Libertarian Party, though he was unsuccessful in his attempt to be its nominee for the presidential election of 2016. He wanted to give it another shot in 2020 but pulled out eventually. “Decriminalise marijuana, bring our troops home, end the madness of our education system, reduce the size of government, hamstring the DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration), and let all people out of prison (who are there) for non-violent crimes.” McAfee said, in his 30-second introduction at the party’s presidential debate in 2016. “What we insert into our bodies or our minds is our own business,” he would go on to say. His death came hours after a court ordered his extradition back to the United States, where he is wanted for tax evasion. He was arrested last year at the Barcelona airport while he was reportedly about to board a flight to Istanbul. “The words ‘Arrested’ and ‘McAfee’ are frequently found together in the same sentence,” he once tweeted. He made his name and money in business. He was considered a pioneer in the field of security technology. His McAfee Associates, which sold anti-virus software, was started in 1987. And by 1994, two years after taking it public, he exited the company. It wouldn’t be until 2010 that Intel bought the then-avatar of this company, by which time, however, the McAfee name was starting to get controversial. Loss of wealth McAfee, it was reported, lost a lot of his wealth in the financial crisis of 2007. At that time, he had financial interests in the real estate sector. He could never replicate the success of his anti-virus software despite dabbling in many businesses — from an instant messaging platform to herbal antibiotics, from secure computer network devices to Bitcoin mining — over the years. His cryptocurrency business interest only got him more troubles from the authorities. His problems with law spanned many countries. He once ran away from Belize where authorities considered him a “person of interest” in connection with the murder of a neighbour. He was then arrested for illegally entering Guatemala. In 2019, he refused a court order that directed him to pay $25 million to the murdered neighbour’s estate. He tweeted, “I have not responded to a single one of my 37 lawsuits in the past 11 years.” On Twitter, his tryst with controversies continued — in the form of his posts on everything from masks during the time of coronavirus to the Deep State. He had pondered about getting killed as also, more recently, about death. On September 18, 2020, his last birthday, he tweeted, “75 years of a roller coaster ride between Heaven and Hell... Constantly passing ‘normal’ as a speeding train might pass an intersection. I would have it no other way.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/the-rise-fall-and-death-of-an-antivirus-software-pioneer/article34959051.ece
25 June 2021||COLOMBO,||Rajapaksa pardons 16 ‘political prisoners’||President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Thursday pardoned 94 persons, including 16 ‘political prisoners’ and one murder convict on death row, on the occasion of the ‘Poson Poya [full moon]’ day that bears religious significance, marking the arrival of Buddhism to Sri Lanka. While Tamil parties and human rights defenders welcomed the release of the suspects arrested under the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), government critics and lawyers slammed the release of former MP Duminda Silva, who was sentenced to death in 2016 for murdering a political rival. Significant start: TNA The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) welcomed the PTA detainees’ release before completion of their full jail terms. “This is a small yet significant start which we hope will soon be completed with the release of all political prisoners, including those against whom cases are still pending. Some cases have dragged for more than 10 years, with no end in sight,” TNA spokesman M.A. Sumanthiran said. Intervening in Parliament recently, Youth and Sports Minister Namal Rajapaksa, son of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, said at least 35 prisoners, including terror suspects from the years of war, had been in prisons longer than their sentences had called for, and sought justice for them. “Some of them have been in there for longer than my age [35]. No charges have been filed against them till today,” he said, highlighting what activists have, for long, cited while raising concern over arbitrary, prolonged detention enabled by the PTA. Around 100 Tamils arrested under the controversial law have been in custody for at least over a decade. While the government accuses them of being former LTTE cadres or supporters, the TNA has insisted they are “political prisoners” on the basis they allegedly committed crimes for the political objective of a separate state, a cause that ceased to exist after the civil war ended in 2009. In the last year alone, some 100 persons have been arrested under the PTA, including over “silly allegations” such as Facebook posts, Batticaloa MP Shanakiyan Rasamanickam recently told the Parliament. The year-long detention of lawyer Hejaaz Hizbullah and poet Ahnaf Jazeem under the PTA have also drawn international condemnation, including from the UN, and more recently the European Parliament, that have called for the repeal of the PTA. Murderer’s release Although the release of the 16 persons on Thursday was welcome, “the positive gesture has been marred by the President’s pardon to Duminda Silva, his close political ally who was convicted for murder,” Mr. Sumanthiran said. This is President Rajapaksa’s second pardon to a murder convict. In March 2020, he freed army man Sunil Ratnayake, who was on death row for killing eight Tamil civilians, including a five-year-old and two teenagers, during the civil war in the year 2000. The main Opposition party Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB, or United People’s Front) has called for withdrawal of the presidential pardon to the former MP, calling it a “violation” of the independence of the judiciary. Commenting on the development, the Bar Association of Sri Lanka asked on what basis the President took the decision to pardon Mr. Silva. While the President had the power and discretion to pardon, such discretion must always be “used judiciously”, and such power “must not be exercised arbitrarily and selectively,” the Association said in a statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/rajapaksa-pardons-16-political-prisoners/article34958878.ece

The protesters defied a ban on large gatherings instituted to fight a coronavirus surge that shows little sign of abating. It was their first large protest after a hiatus of about three months caused by the pandemic and the jailing of protest leaders, who have since been released on bail. The government of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha is facing criticism that it botched pandemic recovery plans by failing to secure adequate vaccine supplies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/thai-activists-march-against-government/article34959052.ece

These are unmarked graves.” He said that the graves may at one time have been marked, but “Catholic Church representatives removed these headstones,” adding that doing so is a crime in Canada and they were treating the gravesites “as a crime scene”. Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations chief Bobby Cameron described the finding as “a crime against humanity”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/over-750-graves-found-at-former-canada-school/article34958874.ece

Across the densely populated metropolis, people lined up early in the morning to buy the paper, which in recent years had become an increasingly outspoken critic of Chinese and Hong Kong authorities’ efforts to limit the freedoms found here but not in mainland China. The paper was gone from newsstands by 8.30 a.m. The newspaper said it was forced to cease operations after police froze $2.3 million of its assets, searched its office and arrested five top editors and executives last week, accusing them of foreign collusion to endanger national security. The paper printed 1 million copies for its last edition — up from the usual 80,000.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/apple-daily-sells-out-final-edition/article34958876.ece
25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Can the CBSE’s plan objectively assess students of Class 12?||The CBSE has prepared a tabulation scheme to determine the marks that students of Class 12 will be awarded in this pandemic year, upon completion of schooling. How reliable is such a scheme against the backdrop of the digital divide, and can it be improved? In a conversation moderated by G. Ananthakrishnan , Anita Rampal and Uday Gaonkar discuss the road ahead for assessing students. Edited excerpts:  Were the students adequately prepared for the assessment system proposed by CBSE? Anita Rampal:I know in Delhi, for instance, students who could not even access online classes. So, for them, it’s important that CBSE is looking at assessment over a longer period, not just this pandemic year, and what marks they got in Class 10 and 11. They have yet to see how their schools are going to be marking them for their internal assessment in Class 12. I have spoken to some who did not understand much of what happened in Class 12 because they barely had a shared phone between the siblings or not even that. This has been a very challenging year. I think this was the fairest that the CBSE could have worked out at the given moment, especially since it was done very late and under court orders. You would have a different experience in a rural setting, Mr. Gaonkar. What do you think? Uday Gaonkar:I’m working in a state-run school for Classes 8 to 10. Last year, only 80-85 days of physical classes were held. Normally, the academic year should have 200 working days. The syllabus was reduced by 30%. So, that is a mismatch: school days were reduced to 50% and the syllabus cut only by 30%. We were forced to teach hurriedly. Meaningful learning involves a lot of interaction between students, teachers and the community. In this scenario, we are just forced to complete the syllabus. The Government of Karnataka tried broadcasting classes: video classes were broadcast on Doordarshan and even on YouTube, but ours is a very remote location in a rural area. Only 30% students have smartphones. Others have keypad phones. Students found it very difficult to get access to those YouTube videos. On TV and the Internet, what’s their efficacy in terms of pedagogy? AR:Very poor. For decades, we have struggled to move beyond just chalk and talk and staring at the blackboard. That itself is not pedagogy. We seem to be losing a lot of the work that we may have done in the last few decades. Learning happens through discussions with others, through engagement with activities or with the world around you. Now, asking students to stare at a screen is worse than even staring at a blackboard. This is not learning; this is just a kind of coaching. You have learnt something, but you are told that you can have a person or a machine to help you revise it. Digital coaching has been pushed relentlessly by the industry of education technology. This time they really had it big. You can see the kinds of billionaires who have come out of this industry. For at least two decades, most educators in India have tried to resist the pressures of the computer industry which said that you must have smart boards and computers in the classroom. We have said that these can only be add-ons in places where there are essential resources for actual teaching and learning; they cannot be a substitute for activities and discussions among learners. The pandemic has not only devastated the lives and livelihoods of a majority of our children, but has exacerbated divides. During a board exam, we know that children from disparate backgrounds take the exam and are marked for the same questions, irrespective of the kinds of resources, schools and teachers they’ve had. Now, this is an added layer to that divide. And this digital divide seems to be overwhelming, so much so that the government is bringing out guidelines on home learning and homeschooling, almost putting the responsibility on the learner and the family instead of the system. That is going to be damaging. When the Right to Education (RTE) law was enacted, the Ministry had appended to the Act a significant note, a justification for each of the clauses. One important justification was that if a child is not able to learn, it is not the failure of the child but of the system. Today, what is going to happen when the system is going to take responsibility for all these lapses, for the inability to connect with our students? We need to not just push the syllabus, but also emotionally support their agency, give them the confidence to continue despite all the odds, because many students are going to drop out after the pandemic is over. So, it’s not just a matter of what marks we will give them for Class 12. What can feasibly be done this year? AR:All the State Boards should make sure they’ve looked at assessments, at what students have done. I don’t like the term ‘learning loss’ because again, it puts the responsibility on the student. I think the youngest children have learned a lot. They’ve learned the difficult lessons of life, so we shouldn’t be calling it learning loss. Boards are very distant, remote entities. Schools should really make that intimate and compassionate connect. First, look at students and support them, relieve them of their traumas and anxieties, and then assess them over a longer period. Look at their Class 10, Class 11, look at all the work and projects that they may have done, or can do even now, and then assess them. Of course, if students have not had online classes at all, the school will need to take a call on that: how do they do an internal assessment? I think they will have to be empathetic, careful and fair. The RTE Act says that up to age 14, there should be continuous and comprehensive assessment, but the system never heeded that. What it did, instead, was a poor substitute, what the CBSE called continuous assessment. We need a rethinking on continuous assessment. It’s not just a mark on a paper. It is the assessment of abilities — students’ expression, writing, observation, ability to critically think and experiment. During the pandemic how can you provide instruction to students? UG:Last year, the Bharat Gyan Vigyan Samithi (BGVS), most of them teachers, started Vatar Sala, a neighbourhood school [in Karnataka]. Students here interact even during a lockdown period and because they know each other, they interact, they share one playground. We thought that one teacher or volunteer will help the students learn. One activity that we have developed is for children to collect electricity bills from their friends in their neighbourhood and transfer that data into another table for that information to be tabulated. They use that information to get various inferences, for example, per capita electricity consumption in that area. We have developed worksheets and activity sheets this year also. The system is set around one school-leaving examination. Is the situation conducive to having a standardised exam, besides entrance exams? AR:Exams meant as entrance exams are selective. You have a large number of people, you have fewer seats. But a school exam does not have to be selective. It should be a school-leaving exam based on what you have learnt right through the period or right through two years. That is much more healthy. It does not have to be standardised, which is never a very good format for children because education is really rooted in a child’s environment. The more decentralised the assessment, the more rigorous and better it is, the more it discerns what students have learned. You could have a common textbook, but the best way to assess is to be more decentralised. The RTE Act says don’t take a centralised assessment for selecting/ admitting students into school or for any other purpose. All our assessment theories tell us that better assessment is done in a trusting environment. We have statistical ways of seeing that these are not unfair, or can be moderated in ways that do not get skewed towards any particular State or district or school. CBSE has stipulated results committees in schools. Is that a sound approach, with 40% of the marking at Class 12 level? AR:It is okay to have some external component of the committee, some people who can understand assessment and who also look at fair distributions. For instance, in our university assessment for the four-year B.El.Ed teacher education programme run by many colleges under our faculty, there is a large component of internal assessment. We have a good system of moderation, where all colleges actually look at samples of work, of their highest and lowest marks, and then decide whether they fall within a fair marking distribution. If some college marking is skewed, those marks are moderated by consensus. This is a challenging process, it needs time and patience and careful rigour, which could be developed within the school system.  Mr. Gaonkar, could you tell us about your report on education reform? UG:BGVS submitted a report last year to the committee set up by the government on online classes. Our experience with Vatar Sala was very helpful. We gave some data collected by a national sample survey about Internet access and availability of devices. We said that it is injustice to have online classes for school students because it will not reach all the students, and recommended some paper-based activity sheets. Even learning kits were tried. What did you find from the survey and recommend as remedy? UG:Of the 70% of the students living in rural areas, only 6%-7% or even 2% have computers at home — laptops or computers — and only 10%-12% know how to handle the computer and Internet. Students who don’t have a mobile phone have to share the phones of their friends. Most of the students have only basic keypad mobiles, no smartphones, and more than 20% of the students don’t have a mobile phone. So, we said that is unjust. Even though Chandana television reaches more than 60%-70% students, these are PPTs (power point presentations) without any interaction. That is not learning. If conditions don’t really improve for children to go back to physical classes, what would you do for 2022? AR:We should be prepared to run schools only when there are lean periods between COVID-19 waves when it is safe. And in that time, try and maximise the time to keep them engaged, not just give them memory-based information. More importantly, we need to keep in touch with them at home. Maybe give them some handouts, worksheets. Assessment should be closely tied to learning. UG:This year is an opportunity to look into this matter differently. Board exams made the schools tuition centres. Now, we can make schools learning spaces again by providing real experiences rather than virtual experiences. Students gather knowledge in a fragmented way, whether it is language or the sciences or maths. Classes are fragmented age-wise. We can club them as far as possible and children can learn with their elders’ help. It is time to rethink school education.  Most of the students have only basic keypad mobiles, no smartphones, and more than 20% of the students don’t have a mobile phone.

25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||The rural economy can jump-start a revival||The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic could be slowly receding with a decline in the official estimates of daily infections and deaths. The economy is also very gradually getting back to normal, with many States beginning to ease some of the restrictions imposed in their lockdowns. However, the challenge of an economic recovery is far more serious than the health pandemic despite official claims of there being an economic recovery. Last month, the National Statistical Office (NSO) released the estimates of the Indian Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth for the fiscal year 2020-21. The decline in GDP, at 7.3%, was slightly better than expectation, even though this is a gross underestimate of the reality given the methodological issue of underestimation of the economic distress in the unorganised sector. Making things worse But what makes economic recovery challenging is that this decline followed three years of sharp decline in GDP even before the novel coronavirus pandemic hit the country. Economic growth had already decelerated to 4% in 2019-20, less than half from the high of 8.3% in 2016-17. Since then, the slowdown in the economy has not only made things worse as far as economic recovery is concerned but also come at a huge cost for a majority of households which have lost jobs and incomes. The pandemic has only worsened an already fragile economic situation. The sharp decline in GDP was partly a result of the trend of a slowdown in economic activity since 2016-17. But a large part of the economic outcome in the first year of the pandemic is also a result of a mishandling of the economic situation. While a strict national lockdown certainly hit economic activity last year, what made matters worse was the less than adequate response from the Government in increasing fiscal support to revive demand in the economy. Many of the grand announcements remained largely on the monetary side without the enabling policy framework to help small and medium enterprises as well as the large unorganised sector which bore the brunt of the restrictions in economic activity. Agriculture, a key driver Despite the lack of fiscal support, an important contributor to the better-than-expected economic performance was the resilience of the rural economy, particularly the agricultural sector. While rural areas were the first point of refuge for a majority of migrants who walked back thousands of kilometres from urban metropolitan areas, agriculture was the only major sector (other than electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services) which reported an increase in Gross Value Added (GVA) in 2020-21. It not only provided jobs to returning migrants but also sustained the economy in the rural areas. Agriculture has not only been the biggest saviour during the period of the pandemic but has consistently been an important driver of the economy throughout the last five years which has seen the economy slow down sharply. The average growth rate in agriculture GVA in the last five years, at 4.8%, is significantly higher than the GVA growth of the economy as a whole, at 3.6%, in the last five years.  But can the rural sector play saviour again? Unlikely, in the present context. And it will not be due to any natural calamity such as drought but a result of the neglect and policy missteps by the Government. Even though the lockdowns imposed by the State governments at the beginning of the second wave were less severe when compared to last year, they did impact the non-agricultural economy as is evident from the high frequency data for the last two months. The expectation of positive growth in this fiscal year may suggest recovery. However, given that the economy has already suffered last year, any recovery will largely be a statistical artefact driven by the low base of last year rather than a real recovery. The fact that a majority of households have already suffered job losses and income decline which are yet to regain their pre-pandemic levels suggests caution in making any inference on an economic recovery. However, even the aggregate data are unlikely to capture the actual extent of devastation in the rural areas. While this is true for even the basic estimates of death and the health catastrophe caused by the pandemic, it is even more severe in its economic impact. Similar to the official statistics which have underestimated deaths due to the pandemic in most States — as has been brought out recently in several newspapers — the economic distress in rural areas is also largely unreported and underestimated. The second wave affected rural areas disproportionately, in terms of health but also in terms of livelihoods. Many households have lost an earning member and an equally large number have spent a large sum on private health care expenditure in dealing with the infection. It will not be surprising if rural areas now witness a sharp rise in indebtedness from non-institutional sources. However, the response from the Government has not been commensurate with the scale of the pandemic in rural areas. Unlike last year, the Government has not increased the allocation this year for the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS). For the country as a whole, despite an increase in employment demand in NREGS, the person-days generated in May 2021 was only 65% when compared to May 2020. While the free food-grain scheme has been extended this year as well, it does not include pulses as was provided last year. Similarly, there has not been any cash transfer to vulnerable groups, unlike last year. Decline in jobs, income The impact of declining incomes and job losses on demand is now visible even in rural areas. While real wages have continued to decline with the latest estimates of April 2021 showing a decline in rural non-agricultural wages by 0.9% per annum in the last two years, agricultural wages continue to stagnate. One indicator of declining demand is the decline in wholesale prices of most of the agricultural commodities. Cereals and vegetables, which together account for more than half of crop output, have seen prices decline on a year-on-year basis for more than six months now. This is happening at a time when international agricultural prices are at an all-time high. Some of this is reflected in the rise in inflation in pulses and oilseeds groups, both of which are largely imported. The net result is a peculiar situation where output prices for dominant agricultural commodities in the domestic market are declining while consumer prices of essentials such as edible and pulses are contributing to rising inflation. Inflation threat Rising inflation further threatens to reduce the purchasing power of the rural economy struggling with declining incomes and job losses. This is further compounded by the shift in terms of trade against agriculture which has put agricultural incomes under strain. The rise in input prices for diesel has already contributed to rising input costs but the recent increase in fertilizer prices for most of the complex fertilizers have also added to the misery of farmers. Rising inflation in international commodity prices also threatens the rural non-farm economy. A majority of the rural non-farm sector already struggling from low demand has now seen its profit margins getting impacted due to the increase in the cost of raw material. Despite these setbacks, the rural economy including the agricultural economy continues to remain crucial for any strategy of economic revival. But for that, it will require proactive intervention from the Government to protect the rural population by speeding up vaccination. Unfortunately, so far, the rural areas have been lagging behind in the overall rate of vaccination. At the same time, rural areas will also need greater fiscal support, both in terms of direct income support to revive demand in the economy but also through various subsidies and protection from the rising inflation in input prices. This urgent intervention is not just necessary to support economic revival but also prevent another humanitarian crisis, this time as a result of economic mismanagement.

25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Staging a comeback, re-energising India’s Africa policy||Africa is considered a foreign policy priority by India. The Narendra Modi government designed a forward-looking strategy to deepen relations with African countries. Its implementation was managed quite well, with much political will invested in expanding the multi-faceted engagement. Even as the COVID-19 era began in March 2020, New Delhi took new initiatives to assist Africa through prompt despatch of medicines and later vaccines. But now the policy implementation needs a critical review. The macro picture The latest economic data confirms what was apprehended by experts: India-Africa trade is on a decline. According to the Confederation of Indian Industry, in 2020-21, India’s exports to and imports from Africa stood, respectively, at $27.7 billion and $28.2 billion, a reduction of 4.4% and 25% over the previous year. Thus, bilateral trade valued at $55.9 billion in 2020-21, fell by $10.8 billion compared to 2019-20, and $15.5 billion compared to the peak year of 2014-15. India’s investments in Africa too saw a decrease from $3.2 billion in 2019-20 to $2.9 billion in 2020-21. Total investments over 25 years, from April 1996 to March 2021, are now just $70.7 billion, which is about one-third of China’s investment in Africa. COVID-19 has caused an adverse impact on the Indian and African economies. India’s top five markets today are South Africa, Nigeria, Egypt, Kenya and Togo. The countries from which India imports the most are South Africa, Nigeria, Egypt, Angola and Guinea. India’s top three exports to Africa are mineral fuels and oils (processed petroleum products), pharmaceutical products and vehicles. Mineral fuels and oils, (essentially crude oil) and pearls, precious or semi-precious stones are the top two imports accounting for over 77% of our imports from Africa. The composition of the India-Africa trade has not changed much over the two decades. Global competition These latest trends in bilateral economic relations should be assessed against two broad developments. First, COVID-19 has brought misery to Africa. As on June 24, 2021, Africa registered 5.2 million infections and 1,37,855 deaths. Given Africa’s population (1.3 billion) and what happened elsewhere (the United States, Europe and India), these figures may not have drawn international attention, but Africans have been deeply affected and remain ill-equipped. A recent World Health Organization survey revealed that 41 African countries had fewer than 2,000 working ventilators among them. Despite these shortcomings, Africa has not done so badly. Experts suggest that the strength of community networks and the continuing relevance of extended family play an important supportive role. Besides, Africa has some of the protocols in place, having recently suffered from Ebola, and managed it reasonably well. Sadly though, with much of the world caught up in coping with the novel coronavirus pandemic’s ill effects, flows of assistance and investment to Africa have decreased. Second, as a recent Gateway House study, Engagement of External Powers in Africa; Takeaways for India (https://bit.ly/3qoI4kv and https://bit.ly/3xOfFXE), showed, Africa experienced a sharpened international competition, known as ‘the third scramble’, in the first two decades of the 21st century. A dozen nations from the Americas, Europe and Asia have striven to assist Africa in resolving the continent’s political and social challenges and, in turn, to benefit from Africa’s markets, minerals, hydrocarbons and oceanic resources, and thereby to expand their geopolitical influence. A mix of competition and contestation involving traditional and new players, especially the United States, the European Union (EU), China, Japan and India, has attracted much attention from governments, media and academia. While China has successfully used the pandemic to expand its footprint by increasing the outflow of its vaccines, unfortunately India’s ‘vax diplomacy’ has suffered a setback. This came in the wake of the debilitating second wave of COVID-19 in the country and the shortage of vaccine raw materials from the U.S. Geopolitical tensions in Asia and the imperative to consolidate its position in the Indo-Pacific region have compelled New Delhi to concentrate on its ties with the United Kingdom, the EU, and the Quad powers, particularly the U.S. Consequently, the attention normally paid to Africa lost out. India’s role This must now change. For mutual benefit, Africa and India should remain optimally engaged. It was perhaps this motivation that shaped the substantive intervention made by External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on May 19 in the UN Security Council’s open debate on conflict and post-pandemic recovery in Africa. Touching on politico-diplomatic dimensions, he regretted that “the voice of Africa is not given its proper due” in the Security Council (https://bit.ly/3qle5Kl). He highlighted India’s role in peacekeeping in Africa, in lending support to African counter-terrorism operations, and contributing to African institutions through training and capacity-enhancing assistance. India’s aid for economic development in the African continent is set to continue, he assured. His visit to Kenya (June 12-14 ) has helped to re-establish communication with Africa at a political level. It is time to seize the opportunity and restore Africa to its primary position in India’s diplomacy and economic engagement. The third India-Africa Forum Summit was held in 2015. The fourth summit, pending since last year, should be held as soon as possible, even if in a virtual format. Fresh financial resources for grants and concessional loans to Africa must be allocated, as previous allocations stand almost fully exhausted. Without new commitments, India’s Africa policy would be like a car running on a near-empty fuel tank. Areas with promise The promotion of economic relations demands a higher priority. Industry representatives should be consulted about their grievances and challenges in the COVID-19 era. It is essential “to impart a 21st century complexion to the partnership with Africa”, as the above-mentioned study argues. This means developing and deepening collaborations in health, space and digital technologies. Finally, to overcome the China challenge in Africa, increased cooperation between India and its international allies, rates priority. The recent India-EU Summit has identified Africa as a region where a partnership-based approach will be followed (https://bit.ly/3wW1jUV). Similarly, when the first in-person summit of the Quad powers is held in Washington, a robust partnership plan for Africa should be announced. For it to be ready in time, work by Quad planners needs to begin now.

25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Protecting prisoners’ rights||The catastrophic surge in COVID-19 cases across India in April and May led to a great number of deaths (still being counted) and put an enormous strain on the healthcare system and governments. In the midst of the surge, prisoners were largely forgotten. The failure of the authorities to reduce severe overcrowding in prisons left thousands of prisoners at risk of infection and death. According to data, there are 12,715 inmates lodged in 11 sections of Tihar Jail alone as against the lodging capacity of 7,425. Out of them, 11,077 are undertrials. Violating human rights As was expected, given the poor state of prisons in India, hundreds of prisoners got infected during the pandemic and a number of them died. This vitiates a fundamental right derived from Article 21 of the Constitution. Overcrowded jails are a violation of the human rights of prisoners ( Re-Inhuman Conditions in 1382 v. State of Assam , 2018). As the court said in Charles Sobraj v. The Suptd., Central Jail, Tihar, 1978, “imprisonment does not spell farewell to fundamental rights”. The aim of imprisonment is not merely deterrence of crime but also reformation. Apart from risking the lives of inmates, ignorance of the poor conditions of prisons has also added to the misery of the families of those in jail. Since physical meetings between the inmates and family members were suspended, many families have been unaware of the conditions of their loved ones in prison. While the Supreme Court ordered that prisons adopt video conferencing technologies to overcome the lack of physical meetings, this has not been properly implemented, according to Amnesty International. A report of the organisation noted that prisoners in Jammu and Kashmir were allowed a phone call to their family only once in 15 days. In May, prominent Hurriyat leader and chairman of Tehreek-e-Hurriyat, Mohammad Ashraf Sehrai, died in detention in Jammu. Sehrai had been jailed under the Public Safety Act, a detention law that allows detention of any individual for up to two years without a trial or charge. He had tested positive for COVID-19 posthumously. His son said that Sehrai had complained of ill-health when the family had spoken to him 10 days earlier but there had been delay in his treatment till death became inevitable. Sehrai’s death has exposed the condition of prisons in Jammu and Kashmir. It has also exposed the condition of political prisoners who often languish in jail for years and are rarely convicted. Political prisoners Ever since the pandemic outbreak, human rights activists have demanded the immediate release of political prisoners on humanitarian grounds but this has fallen on deaf ears. There are several Kashmiris kept in preventive detention in jails in Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, and other parts of India. A number of them are undertrials. According to Article 14 (3)(c) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, an accused has the right to be tried without undue delay. The state is bound to provide legal assistance to prisoners, ensure their safe and timely release and safeguard their rights to a fair and speedy trial ( Hussainara Khatoon v. Home Secretary, State of Bihar, 1979). But this is not the reality for a large number of prisoners. Taking cognisance of this issue, the Supreme Court directed the States to examine releasing inmates, convicted or facing trial on non-serious charges, from jails either on regular bail or on parole. It also directed them to provide transport facility to the prisoners to reach home. It is hoped that States will comply. Some have said that they have begun reviewing prison occupancy. Given that States have started vaccinating prisoners too, the situation may improve soon. But India cannot ignore the problem of overcrowding, pandemic or no pandemic.

25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Stopping the surge||After a debilitating second wave of COVID-19, cash-strapped State governments have responded to falling cases with a swift unlock programme in most districts. Some States have opted to open the floodgates, allowing dine-in restaurants, gymnasia, most shops and religious centres in areas with low test positivity rates for the coronavirus. Lockdown-weary citizens, on their part, have greeted the reopening with road trips to tourist centres, even travelling across inter-State borders. This is not surprising, considering that the country has gone through weeks of anguish, when death and misery touched the lives of millions. The déjà vu moment, worryingly similar to the misplaced optimism following the first wave, is a time for caution and to avoid the missteps that produced the deadly second wave. Already, Maharashtra has expressed worry that there is a noticeable rise in cases in just a week; the experience of other States will soon be known. There is a lot to be concerned about, since the highly transmissible delta variant of the virus that overran cities and rural areas in April-May continues to threaten unvaccinated populations, senior citizens and people with weak immunity in particular. The likely risk for children also causes apprehension. That it has morphed into a delta plus variant through a fresh mutation underscores the need for greater vigilance. With the unprecedented knowledge base created in just over a year on COVID-19, governments have the resources to plan finely tuned reopening strategies. The current consensus on preventing spread, as WHO points out, is to avoid the three Cs — crowded places, close-contact settings and confined and enclosed spaces. The intersection of these is the most dangerous, and relaxations given by some States fall within this red zone: dine-in restaurants, cultural performances, shops, and social events in enclosed spaces. A significant number of people are unwilling to wear masks and adhere to distancing, making it difficult to stop transmission, including on trains and buses. Neither have State governments moved to provide certified masks to the public liberally, to be able to insist that they be worn. The insurance and banking sectors have made slow progress in enabling employees to work from home using real time platforms that can reduce crowding in offices. It is clear that until vaccines are freely available and cover every individual, the economy can reopen with a modicum of safety only with strong leadership. A record vaccination rate on a given day may encourage more people to come forward to be immunised, but there are not enough doses available, and data show rural areas are doing badly compared to cities even for the first dose. The Centre is cautious this time, warning of a third wave, but the imperative is to open windows of activity gradually without dropping the ball on safety.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/stopping-the-surge/article34958856.ece
25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Deserving winners||The sun, after playing hide and seek with the clouds, finally shone in all its glory at Southampton and the inaugural ICC World Test Championship summit clash had its closure on the reserve sixth day. New Zealand emerged as deserving winners with skipper Kane Williamson leading from the front through knocks of 49 and an unbeaten 52, both outings buttressed by patience and a steely resolve to counter a strong Indian bowling unit. The Black Caps won by eight wickets and Virat Kohli’s men had to draw solace from being second-best. They had to accept that the opposition was stronger in English conditions akin to New Zealand backyards unlike the tropical heat and abrasive pitches seen in India. Williamson also relished his luck at the toss and immediately elected to field with the damp weather and moist air further enhancing his pace-attack’s potency. Even while the seniors Tim Southee and Trent Boult did their nagging lines, tall Kyle Jamieson, the man-of-the-final, extracted bounce and lateral movement and shackled the tentative Indian batsmen nibbling outside the off-stump. In a Test spiced by the elements, a low-scoring slugfest was in order and once New Zealand snatched a 32-run first-innings lead and reduced India’s second dig to just 170, barring a miracle Kohli’s men were down for the count and the meagre 139-run target hardly stretched the eventual champion. India’s cricketing nostalgia is infused with the glories of ‘Indo-Pak’ rivalry, the 1983 World Cup final against the mighty West Indies or the battles against Australia right from the miracle of Eden Gardens in 2001. But it has to be admitted that matches involving India and New Zealand have also acquired a mystique of their own. In recent ICC duels, New Zealand held the edge and it continued in Southampton. During the 2019 World Cup semifinal at Manchester, New Zealand prevailed and even that face-off spilled into the reserve day. The tale back then was one of swing and dark skies and the same backdrop was present at Southampton. New Zealand has often ended up as the bridesmaid in premier tournaments but a corner was turned over the last few days and it augurs well for cricket’s health while new champions step up. India, which last won ICC silverware — the Champions Trophy — in 2013, did well in the run-up to the latest final and its rousing triumph in Australia earlier this year was the stuff of dreams. The squad has the right mix and after a break, it will be time to get back into the bio-bubble and then play the five-Test series against host England from August 4. A battle of attrition awaits India while New Zealand flies back with the champion’s halo.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/deserving-winners/article34958857.ece
25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Of Anand, simultaneous chess and the cheating controversy||Anticipation was in the air that bright October afternoon in 1987 at Pala, a bustling town in central Kerala known for its rubber plantations. Some 40 young chess players had come from across Kerala for the State junior championship. For some of us, it was our first big tournament. So, the fact that we were playing at such an event was cause for excitement. But there was another reason why we were so excited that afternoon: we were to meet Viswanathan Anand, who had recently been crowned the world junior champion in the Philippines. The State’s chess association was felicitating him. Anand had come along with his mother, who used to accompany him for tournaments those days. He also took part in an exhibition event called simultaneous display, a term that has now become familiar because of a recent controversy following an online fundraiser. In simultaneous chess, a strong player takes on several less talented opponents, ranging from 15 to 50 mostly, at the same time. There have been instances of Grandmasters playing against hundreds, too. In fact, Iran’s Ehsan Ghaem Maghami set a world record in 2011 when he took on 604 players at Tehran (for the record, he won 580 of them, drew 16 and lost eight). Usually the number is much lower. The player makes a move on one board and then goes to the next one. While the multiple participants get plenty of time, the strong player has to make his calculations quickly. But as the statistics from Maghami’s simultaneous display suggest, the Grandmaster wins most of the games. Grandmasters can defeat a large number of opponents even while playing blindfolded. At Pala, if I remember correctly, Anand won all games but two. He did, in due course, go on to win games more important than that in a career that has had few parallels in world sport. As a reporter of The Hindu , I have written on some of his finest moments over the years. I have also been privileged to interview him on several occasions, including a memorable one at his residence in Chennai three years ago. He greeted me with the same friendly smile which I first saw in Pala three decades ago. It was a pleasure listening to him talk for well over two hours. Anand is one of the greatest minds of our time. The entire chess world – and those who have come across him anywhere – would agree that he is an incredibly nice, polite, humble gentleman, on whose head sit lightly five world championships and the credit for single-handedly revolutionising chess in India. It is little wonder then everyone felt bad when news emerged earlier this month that some of Anand’s celebrity opponents had cheated, using the computer, during the simultaneous display organised by chess.com to raise funds for COVID-19 relief. It would count among Indian sport’s great fiascos. Anand didn’t deserve to be treated like that. The celebrity event featuring film stars, singers and businessmen was supposed to gain publicity for chess, which isn’t as popular in India as other sports like cricket or football. It generated publicity alright, but of the negative kind.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/of-anand-simultaneous-chess-and-the-cheating-controversy/article34958866.ece
25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||High cost of secrecy From an editorial||The U.S. government has been fighting a losing battle with the press, which has published secret official documents about the origin and escalation of the war in Vietnam. As the Government took the New York Times to court and got the publication of the documents stopped, the task of publication was taken up in turn by the Washington Post , the Chicago Sun-Times and the Boston Globe . The Government got a further jolt when some of the judges held that the newspapers did nothing seriously wrong in publishing the documents, since the consequences might be to preserve national security, rather than endanger it. Though the war in Vietnam continues and American troops are fighting there, it should be pointed that the Pentagon documents concern the decisions of past Presidents like Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson and their advisers. They do not refer to current operations, except in a historical context. Americans have recently begun to ask: “How did we get into this war? Why did we send half a million soldiers there?” The official papers have supplied the information which the public needs in order to evaluate the policies which led to deep American involmement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/high-cost-of-secrecy-from-an-editorial/article34958865.ece
25 June 2021||MUMBAI,||Reliance to invest Rs. 75,000 crore in ‘new energy’||Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) on Thursday announced plans to invest Rs. 75,000 crore in its ‘new energy’ business. RIL aims to set up four large manufacturing units involving an investment of Rs. 60,000 crore in three years at Jamnagar, Gujarat. “We have started work on developing the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex on 5,000 acres in Jamnagar,” CMD Mukesh Ambani told shareholders at the company’s 42nd annual general meeting. “It will be among the largest such integrated renewable energy manufacturing facilities in the world.” He said the four factories would make and fully integrate all ‘critical components of the new energy ecosystem’. “We will build an integrated solar photovoltaic module factory. We will build an advanced energy storage battery factory, an electrolyser factory, and for converting hydrogen into motive and stationary power, we will build a fuel cell factory,” he said. “Reliance will thus create a fully integrated, end-to-end renewables energy ecosystem,” he added. Mr. Ambani said the Jamnagar complex would offer infrastructure and utilities to make ancillary material and equipment so that all critical materials were available in time. “We will invest an additional Rs. 15,000 crore in value chain, partnerships and future technologies, including upstream and downstream industries.” ‘Affordable smartphone’ Mr. Ambani also announced that the Google and Jio teams had developed an ‘ultra-affordable’, fully featured 4G smartphone — Jiophone Next. The phone would support applications from both Google and Jio as well as from the Android PlayStore. Developed for the Indian market, the phone would be commercially available from September 10. RIL also announced that Saudi Aramco’s chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan would join the board as an independent director, adding that the RIL-Aramco deal would be formalised in 2021. In 2019, RIL had said it would sell 20% in its oil-to-chemicals unit to Saudi Aramco for $15 billion. On the partnership with Facebook, Mr. Ambani said an initial set of integrations between WhatsApp and JioMart had been introduced on a trial basis. “Our joint teams are developing the full new commerce solution linking merchants and consumers,” the RIL CMD said. The firm planned to unveil these over the next few quarters. He added that RIL had tested Jio’s 5G solutions in India and had demonstrated “speeds well in excess of 1 Gbps... we are confident of being the first to launch full-fledged 5G services.” ‘Threefold growth’ The firm’s subsidiary Reliance Retail would grow at least threefold in the next 3-5 years, he said. The unit, which aims to be among the top 10 global retailers, would create employment for more than 10 lakh people in three years, he added. Reliance Retail would continue to acquire businesses to heighten its offering, sharpen omnichannel capabilities, and drive operating efficiencies, Mr. Ambani said.

25 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Ensure GST cuts reach users’||The National Anti-Profiteering Authority (NAA) has directed GST officials across the country to ensure that the tax rate cuts notified on some COVID-19-related essentials are passed on to consumers. Complaints from end users about lack of price reductions commensurate with the tax cuts, are to be treated on a priority basis and forwarded to the State-level Screening Committees and Standing Committees on Anti-Profiteering, the NAA Secretary A.K. Goel said in a memo posted on its website on Thursday. At its last meeting on June 12, the GST Council had waived the indirect tax levied on two critical drugs, Tocilizumab and Amphotericin B, and reset the tax rate to 5% on 14 COVID-19 essentials. On June 14, the Finance Ministry had notified the revised rates, which are applicable till September 30. “The suppliers are required to commensurately reduce the prices of each of the supplies of Goods and Services made by them so that the benefit of the reduction in tax rates and/or of input tax credits is passed on to the recipients/consumers,” the NAA emphasised. Tax experts said that producers of items ranging from ambulances to pulse oximeters and oxygen concentrators would need to ensure retail price reductions were effected soon and paperwork filed to justify the extent of reductions, in order to avoid action under the anti-profiteering framework. “Businesses dealing with medical supplies that have undergone a GST rate reduction need to ensure that they have adequate documentation to demonstrate that the rate cuts have been passed on to the consumers,” said M.S. Mani, senior director at Deloitte India. Suppliers or firms who had not got the benefit of input tax credits on account of cuts in the GST rate could also file complaints, with the anti-profiteering apparatus.

25 June 2021||MUMBAI,||‘88% of SMBs yet to avail stimulus benefits’||As much as 88% of self-employed, small and micro businesses (SMB) were yet to avail any benefit under the stimulus schemes unveiled by the Centre, the findings of a survey by the Consortium of Indian Associations (CIA) and its 40 partner SMB associations show. Also, 82% of the more than 81,000 self-employed, micro/small businesses (SMBs) surveyed opined that the Union and State governments were not taking care of their interests. The respondents included manufacturers (49%), service providers (15%), self-employed (14%) besides consultants, start-ups, traders, food and hospitality units. The COVID-19 first wave and second wave “induced lockdowns over the last 15 months have severely crippled the sector, as disclosed by the findings of the report,” the CIA said in a release on Thursday. As per the findings, 73% of SMBs had not made any profit during the last fiscal and 42% were unable to decide on retention of employees; 59% said they had reduced/sacked/removed their staff compared with the pre-COVID period. ‘Pain points, solutions’ “Over the past year, CIA has provided vital suggestions on several initiatives taken by the Central and State governments for the benefit of MSMEs,” said K.E. Raghunathan, convenor, CIA. “We realised a data-backed survey would help consolidate the feedback from this sector, to bring out the pain points and provide solutions and a way forward to revive the sector, ” he added. The findings suggest the need for a three-pronged approach by exempting SMBs from statutory compliances, penal actions and litigation; protecting them from high interest burden, price wars, high cost of raw materials, losing employees, penalties, and late fees, and supporting them by giving liberal loans, clearing pending dues, offering moratorium with interest waiver and not declaring sectoral NPAs for a year. CIA proposed that the Centre amend the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006, to strengthen State facilitation councils. It also suggested collecting data on self-employed, MSME units from banks, which could help in correct classification of businesses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/88-of-smbs-yet-to-avail-stimulus-benefits/article34958839.ece

25 June 2021||PATIALA,||Last chance to punch a ticket to Tokyo||The 60th National inter-State athletics championships starting here on Friday will be the last chance for Indian athletes to book a ticket to the Tokyo Olympics and quite a few would be hoping to either attain the elusive qualificaton standard or improve their ranking. Among those aiming for automatic qualification at the five-day meet will be javelin thrower Annu Rani, who has been consistently improving over the last one year and is within sight of the 64m mark. Her personal best of 63.24m is not too far off and the reigning National champion will be hoping to go the distance this time around. Sprint showdown On the track, the much-anticipated showdown between Dutee Chand and Hima Das in the 100m and 200m sprints will be the highlight although the duo has managed to avoid it so far with either withdrawing from at least one event over the past one year. While Dutee came agonisingly close to the 100m qualifying time at the recent Grand Prix 4, she is comfortably placed in the rankings which is not the case with Hima, who has to clock 22.80s in the 200m to qualify. The spotlight will also be on the women’s 4x100m and the men’s 4x400m relay squads with the former hoping to better its National record and the latter aiming to consolidate its position in the rankings, placed precariously at 16th and final qualification spot.  Also hoping to improve his position on the Road to Tokyo rankings will be high jumper Tejaswin Shankar, competing at home after almost two years and coming with a series of NCAA wins under his belt in USA. Tejaswin has also entered in triple jump in keeping with his recent attempts at multiple events and it will be interesting to see how the youngster measures up here. Shot-putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor and discus thrower Kamalpreet Kaur will be high on confidence after their impressive performances in IGP 4 couple of days ago but the pressure will be on veteran thrower Seema Antil who skipped the Grand Prix. Javelin thrower Shivpal Singh, unable to fly abroad for training or competition, will also be in action for the first time since March but steeplechaser Avinash Sable and quartermiler Dharun Ayyasamy have given the event a miss.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/last-chance-to-punch-a-ticket-to-tokyo/article34959156.ece
25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Williamson & Co. soak up the top-of-the-world feeling||After leading his side to its first ICC Trophy in 21 years, Kane Williamson said it was finally good to end up on the right side of a final after losing the last two 50-over World Cup finals in 2015 and 2019. “2019 was a great occasion and a brilliant game of cricket, as well. But obviously, a slightly different feeling being on the right side of the result for us. Also, a part of a great game of cricket and a great occasion where it was the first, I suppose, official World Test Championship, and this is a really good feeling,” said Williamson. Praise for Taylor On his partnership with Ross Taylor, Williamson, who made an unbeaten half-century, said, “... fantastic to be part of a contribution and a partnership like that. Obviously, with Ross, our most experienced player and leader in the group, it was nice that we were able to soak up some of the pressure and then sort of score a few together, although it was really difficult to come by. But having an experienced hitter like Ross out there was certainly helpful. “You know, a really special feeling to be there at the end together and tick those runs off. Even though it was 130-odd on that surface, you never felt comfortable. It was nice to soak up some of that pressure and put together a partnership,” he said. During the post-match presentation, Williamson also credited his team for sticking to its beliefs and style of cricket.  “We know we don't always have the stars and we rely on a few other bits and pieces players to try and stay in games and be competitive. And I think we saw that in this match, we saw a lot of heart, a lot of commitment, what's important to our group and the commitment to the style of cricket we held strong, which was great,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/williamson-co-soak-up-the-top-of-the-world-feeling/article34959123.ece
25 June 2021||Chennai,||A pace battery firing on all cylinders||In his heyday, he earned the sobriquet Sultan of Swing. Now, in the evening of his life, his words carry immense wisdom. The second Test of the 2019-20 India-New Zealand series was in progress at Christchurch, Sir Richard Hadlee’s eyes scan the ground, his steely gaze picking up little things. In the middle, the Indians were crumbling, and the man doing the damage was Kyle Jamieson, all of 6’8”. “We never had someone like him before. Perhaps in the ’50s, but none after that. Nobody with his height and natural bounce,” Hadlee was speaking to The Hindu . “He adds another dimension to the New Zealand bowling,” said Hadlee. The legendary bowler’s words were ringing in the ears when Jamieson pinned the batsmen on the back foot with his lift and, with their footwork disrupted, consumed them with fuller length and swing to scalp five in the Indian first innings of the ICC World Test Championship final at Southampton. And then he opened up the Indian batting on the final day, setting Virat Kohli up with deliveries moving into him and taking him out with one that left the right-hander. Soon, he had Cheteshwar Pujara snapped up in the slips. New Zealand’s pace was always probing, but Jamieson has lent it the cutting edge with his pace, lift, off-stump line, seam movement and swing. And, he changes his length so adeptly. With the arrival of Jamieson, New Zealand’s pace attack is complete. After all, you have the left-right combination of Trent Boult and Tim Southee, who between them, have over 600 Test wickets. They come from varying angles, pitch the ball up, allow it to swing and dare the batsmen to go after them. So confident are they of defeating the batsmen with their movement. The ever-evolving Southee has added the delivery that straightens and holds its line or comes in, to his trademark outswingers. Ask Rohit Sharma who was bamboozled by one such delivery in the second innings. And, Boult is a bag of tricks. The left-armer bowls with equal control from over and round the wicket, can take the ball away from the left-hander from over the wicket and angle it across the right-hander and bring the odd one back. The talented Boult can get the ball to deviate both ways from round the wicket. He is a serial scalp-hunter. Then there is the never-say-die Neil Wagner, all heart, effort and commitment, whose barrage of accurate short-pitched bowling is mixed cleverly with fuller length left-armer's swing whether angling it across or bringing it back. New Zealand, clearly, has the pace attack to be at the acme of Test-playing nations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/a-pace-battery-firing-on-all-cylinders/article34959121.ece
25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Kohli expresses reservation on format||India captain Virat Kohli believes that the World Test Championship (WTC) final should ideally be contested over the course of a three or five-Test series. Speaking after India lost to New Zealand in the one-off WTC final at Southampton on Wednesday, Kohli stated that the current format does not accurately reveal a true champion. “I’m not in absolute agreement with deciding the best Test side in the world over the course of one game. It has to be a test of character over three Tests — which team has the ability to come back into the series, or totally blow away the other team. Hard grind “It can’t just be pressure applied over two days of good cricket. It has to be a hard grind. At the end of three matches, there’s effort, ups and downs, situations changing throughout the course of the series, a chance to rectify things you’ve done wrong in the first game… Then you can really see who’s the better side,” Kohli said at the post-match media interaction. “If you saw the way this game went, why wouldn’t you want to see two more Tests of the teams battling it out to eventually win the WTC? “Historically, all the great Test series’ are remembered for being three or five matches long. I think this definitely has to be brought in. I’m not saying this because we’re not on the winning side. For this (WTC final) to be absolutely memorable, I think it has to happen over three games at a minimum,” said the Indian skipper. “We are not too bothered by this result because we understand what we’ve done over the last three-four years as a Test side. This (WTC final) is not a measure of who we are as a team, and the ability and potential we have had for so many years,” he said. On the team’s batting struggles in the summit clash, Kohli said, “We definitely need to work out better plans in terms of understanding how to score runs. We have to stay in sync with the momentum of the game. and not let the game drift away too much.”  The one-off factor does bring a unique dynamic and makes it [final] exciting. On any given day, anything can happen Williamson    Captain Kohli in   ICC tournaments   2017 Champions Trophy: Lost to Pakistan in the final  2019 World Cup (50-over): Lost to New Zealand in the semifinals  2021 WTC final: Lost to New Zealand in the final||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kohli-expresses-reservation-on-format/article34959128.ece

25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Uzbekistan Open results annulled||World swimming’s governing body FINA has invalidated the results from the Uzbekistan Open Swimming Championship held in April in Tashkent, two months after India swimmer S.P. Likith had alleged that timings were tampered with to suit home swimmers. The competition was an Olympic qualification event where two Uzbek swimmers were declared to have sealed their berths for Tokyo 2020. India’s Srihari Nataraj had clocked 54.07s in the 100m backstroke event, a best Indian performance, just 0.22s short of the mark for Tokyo. His timing of 25.11s in the 50m backstroke was also a new high. Rich haul Indians, in general, had come away with a rich haul of medals (18 gold, seven silver and four bronze), including two in the breaststroke events for Likith. On Thursday, Monal Chokshi, Swimming Federation of India (SFI) secretary, confirmed that the timings clocked in Uzbekistan were annulled after objections from various quarters. But he said that the SFI had no role in this.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/uzbekistan-open-results-annulled/article34959163.ece
25 June 2021||Geneva,||ITA alleges doping corruption in weightlifting||A culture of alleged corruption among international weightlifting officials was detailed on Thursday in an investigative report of covered-up doping cases for athletes who won Olympic and world titles. Three of the sport’s long-time leaders — former International Weightlifting Federation president Tamas Ajan, vice president Nicolae Vlad and executive board member Hasan Akkus — were charged with a range of complicity and tampering offences under the World Anti-Doping Code. Unresolved cases Alleged misconduct for a decade up to 2019, including 146 unresolved doping cases, was laid out in a 50-page document. The investigation was run by the International Testing Agency (ITA) which manages anti-doping programs for Olympic sports. Reasons for the failures to prosecute some doping cases ranged from “chaotic organisational processes” and errors to “outright negligence, complicity, or — at worst — blatant and intentional cover-ups,” ITA investigators wrote. A total of 29 cases cannot be prosecuted due to destroyed evidence or expiring statute of limitations. Ajan and Vlad were implicated in allowing a woman from Vlad’s home country Romania whom they knew was implicated in doping offences to compete and win a gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics. The lifter, Roxana Cocos, was stripped of her medal years later when re-tests revealed her steroid use. Four-year ban for Akkus The ITA has proposed lifetime bans for Ajan and Vlad, while Akkus has been offered a four-year ban. If they don’t accept the bans, the ITA will prosecute the charges at the Court of Arbitration for Sport’s anti-doping tribunal. Vlad was a gold medallist at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and long-time ally of Ajan at the IWF. Ajan was ousted after 20 years as IWF president in the fallout of the allegations first aired by German broadcaster ARD in January 2020. The ITA investigation also details how weightlifting officials evaded World Anti-Doping Agency scrutiny over several years. WADA said on Thursday it had in the past “limited powers to act against International Federations that engaged in the sort of behaviour that is alleged.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ita-alleges-doping-corruption-in-weightlifting/article34959468.ece
25 June 2021||TOKYO,||Japan’s emperor ‘worried’ about hosting Olympics amid pandemic||Japan’s Emperor Naruhito is “extremely worried” that the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics could accelerate the spread of the coronavirus, the head of the Imperial Palace said on Thursday with the Games opening in one month. The games will bring thousands of foreign athletes, officials, sponsors and journalists to Japan during a pandemic, despite caution raised by experts about the risk of infections and the public’s persistent calls for cancellation or further postponement. Yasuhiko Nishimura, grand steward of the Imperial Household Agency, told a news conference that the Emperor has voiced concerns. “His majesty is extremely worried about the current situation of the COVID-19 infections,” Nishimura said. “While there are voices of unease among the public, I believe (the emperor) is concerned that holding the Olympics and Paralympics may lead to the expansion of the infections.” Nishimura also urged the organisers to “take every possible anti-virus measures so as not to cause the spread of the infections at the Olympics and Paralympics, where the emperor serves the Honorary Patron.” The emperor is the symbol of the state with no political power. But like his father, Naruhito has gained broad popularity and his words are highly respected. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is determined to hold the Olympics despite concerns from the public and public health experts. Ugandan tests positive Adding to their concern, officials in Izumisano, a western Japan town hosting the nine-member Ugandan Olympic team for training, said a second member of the team tested positive for the virus. The first, reportedly a coach, was detected upon arrival Saturday in Tokyo. The rest of the team have been isolating at an Osaka hotel. Suga eased a third state of emergency in Tokyo that had been in place since late April and switched to less-stringent measures focusing on shorter bar and restaurant hours. But experts said on Wednesday that infections are already bouncing back in the Tokyo region and could accelerate in coming weeks. Naruhito, 61, also expressed his concern about the pandemic in his speech at an academic award ceremony Monday: “In order to overcome this challenge, it is important for all of us, in and outside of Japan, to bring our hearts together and cooperate.” Naruhito was scheduled to declare the start of the Olympics at the opening ceremony, but details, including his presence at the Games, are yet to be finalised, palace officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/japans-emperor-worried-about-hosting-olympics-amid-pandemic/article34959472.ece
25 June 2021||Paris,||The stage is set for a Tadej Pogacar vs Primoz Roglic rematch||Not so long ago, Tadej Pogacar was a just a promising outsider still learning the ropes of cycling’s biggest race. His rise to become the second-youngest winner of the Tour de France in September last year has changed everything: the 22-year-old returns to the three-week event as the odds-on favourite to defend his title. Going from an ambitious Tour rookie to defending champion in such a short time could have been an unsettling experience. But Pogacar has perfectly dealt with his sudden rise to stardom, linking his Tour triumph with victories this season at the UAE Tour, Tirenno-Adriatico and the prestigious one-day classic Liege-Bastogne-Liege. Since his remarkable feat on the slopes of the Planche des Belles Filles where he snatched the coveted race leader’s yellow jersey in a high-drama time trial, Pogacar has kept improving. He looks even stronger this year, backed by a powerful squad entirely at his service. Pogacar’s biggest rival last year was another rider from Slovenia, Primoz Roglic. The Jumbo-Visma team leader wore the yellow jersey for 11 days on last year’s Tour and had victory in sight only to crack on the eve of the final stage in a spectacular reversal of fortunes. Such a turnaround could have undone his morale for good. But Roglic has recovered in style, very quickly, and is once again among the top contenders. Right after the Tour last year, he won Liege-Bastogne-Liege and the Spanish Vuelta. In April he was stronger than Pogacar at the Itzulia Basque Country and has privileged training at altitude in recent weeks in order to arrive fresh on the starting line, ready to tackle the 3,414 kilometres of three-week odyssey across France. Delayed by a few months last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Tour starts one week earlier than usual so as not to clash with the Olympic Games in Tokyo. The race was initially set to start from Copenhagen, with Denmark hosting its first-ever start. But Copenhagen has been pushed back to 2022 because of the pandemic. The route is less mountainous than last year and features two long individual time trials totalling 58 kilometres. However, some extremely tough ascents in both the Alps and the Pyrenees are on the program, notably on Stage 17 featuring the Col de Peyresourde and another tough climb on Val Louron-Azet before ending up Col du Portet — a 16-kilometre slog with a gradient close to 9%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/the-stage-is-set-for-a-tadej-pogacar-vs-primoz-roglic-rematch/article34959478.ece
25 June 2021||Kolkata,||ATK MB ropes in Finland midfielder Kauko||ATK Mohun Bagan made a big recruitment this season by signing in attacking midfielder Joni Kauko, who played for Finland in the ongoing Euro Cup. Kauko, who signed the contract with ATK MB on Thursday, will be one of the star attractions in the eighth edition of the Indian Super League, which is likely to start later this year. “Many star footballers have played in the ISL, but it is rare for a footballer to sign a contract with an Indian club within three days of playing in the Euro Cup,” said a release from the club while announcing its big acquisition. Multiple roles The 30-year-old can play multiple roles in the midfield and will have a prominent place in head coach Antonio Lopez Habas' attack plans. Kauko is expected to join ATK MB ahead of the club's campaign in the AFC Cup, which is scheduled to be played in the third week of August. Kauko, who played the previous three seasons for the Danish club Esberg FB, is the first foreign signing for ATK MB this season. The club will be announcing its full roster of foreigner soon. Changes are expected as ISL will see a reduction in the number of foreigners from five to four in the playing eleven from this season.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/atk-mb-ropes-in-finland-midfielder-kauko/article34959470.ece
25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||No wasted motion, no needless surround-sound||India’s losing streak in Tests at Southampton got its third extension when Ross Taylor struck New Zealand’s winning runs on Wednesday evening. If the previous two defeats came in series involving host England (2014, 2018), the latest melt-down happened in a bigger contest invested with a larger meaning — the World Test Championship final. New Zealand had also stymied India’s World Cup ambitions in the 2019 edition with a stunning triumph in the semifinal at Manchester and it still remains a festering wound. Skilled unit Virat Kohli’s men again ran into the same opponent thriving on the eternally calm Kane Williamson, a set of handy batsmen ranging from fresher Devon Conway to veteran Taylor and an array of swing bowlers pitching it on a penny and also using the elements as a wonderful ally. Once Williamson won the toss and the fickle English weather kept ushering in a damp curtain, Indian batsmen never felt at ease, even if in the first dig openers Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill strung a 62-run partnership. New Zealand maximised its advantage and with Kyle Jamieson bowling with seductive precision, edges were taken. New Zealand played the percentages better and with Williamson being the batting glue in both outings, the eventual champion always stayed ahead of India. And when the chase commenced on the sixth and final day, the sun was out, the outfield dried up and shots carried to the fence unlike the previous days when the ball seemed arthritic. The winning side also had the advantage of having played two Tests previously against England while Kohli’s men only had intra-squad warm-ups. It was brave of India to step in with five bowlers while expecting Rishabh Pant, Ravindra Jadeja and R. Ashwin to serve as a bridge between the top-order and a weak tail. India needed runs on the board but what emerged proved inadequate and there was not much cushioning for the bowlers when they stepped out with their boots.  India ran into a better side and there is no running away from that fact. Williamson has shaped a unit that works with rigour, is quick to change strategy and all done with remarkable finesse while the on-field behaviour is always one of poise. This was cricket without needless surround-sound but it had a purity and smartness that would have made the late Martin Crowe proud, obviously watching his wards from the skies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/no-wasted-motion-no-needless-surround-sound/article34959124.ece
25 June 2021||LONDON,||Ramkumar fights hard, but falls in the final qualifying round||A spot in the main draw of a Grand Slam eluded Ramkumar Ramanathan yet again, as he lost to Australia’s Marc Polmans 3-6, 6-3, 6-7(2), 6-3, 9-11 in the final qualifying round at the Wimbledon championships, here on Thursday. Showing nerves of steel, Ramkumar saved four match points but eventually fell at the end of a three-hour, 30-minute contest. After the duo split the first two sets, Ramkumar had multiple opportunities to break at the start of the third but squandered all, before losing the set in a tie-break. The 26-year-old, however, raced to a 3-0 lead in the fourth set and kept his level up to take it 6-3 and even the match. In the decider, he was down a match point while serving at 4-5, but survived. Three more match points in game 12 were also saved as he stretched the contest. But the Australian broke his tenacious rival in the 20th game and punched his ticket for next week's main draw. Thiem pulls out World No. 5 Dominic Thiem withdrew from Wimbledon on Thursday after suffering a wrist injury in Mallorca earlier this week. “I’m sorry for pulling out of the upcoming three tournaments I had in my calendar — Wimbledon, Hamburg and Gstaad,” the 27-year-old Austrian wrote on Twitter. “I am determined to come back stronger.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ramkumar-fights-hard-but-falls-in-the-final-qualifying-round/article34959126.ece
25 June 2021||Patiala,||Focusing on reaching quarterfinals: Marijne||The Indian women’s hockey team will be appearing in its second consecutive Olympics at Tokyo and coach Sjoerd Marijne insists the team’s focus is firmly on realising its optimum potential. “The team’s focus has grown in the last few years, but the really important moments were the matches against Argentina. It’s not just about the mindset but also about good results. Against Argentina, I showed them that we entered more in their circle and created more opportunities but they scored more. “I am not making things up, only showing them the reality that we were creating more chances than Argentina. Their confidence has grown and there is belief that we are going to the Olympics not just to participate but to achieve something,” the Dutchman said during a virtual interaction on Thursday.  But while expectations are high, Marijne also believes in tempering them with reality. “If we are realistic, only three teams are ranked below us at the Olympics, so I don’t know what the expectations are based on. Probably because we have done well in the last four years. We are focusing on reaching the quarterfinals and from there anything can happen. “That doesn’t mean we are not good enough, just that we are realistic.” “At the same time, if we do not make the quarters, I will not be disappointed in the girls. I will be only disappointed for them because I see how much they put in every day,” he said. Staying calm Asked about handling the pressure of Olympics, captain Rani Rampal said the team had got used to it. “Pressure is always there, even on those who may have already won Olympic medals, but now we have learnt to handle it. Janneke (Schopman) has been working with us to stay calm and in control and it has helped a lot,” she said. Marijne was also categorical about his team selection. “Picking a team for the Olympics is not about the last 3-4 months, but the past four years. I don’t think a few extra matches would have done much to change my mind about the team.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/focusing-on-reaching-quarterfinals-marijne/article34958855.ece

During a practice session seven years ago, Sachin Tendulkar told him, “You have to believe in yourself, you have to believe you can do miracles.” The words from the great man meant so much to Raina that he tattooed the word ‘Believe’ on his right bicep the same day.  Believe (published by Penguin) also happens to be the title of his recently released autobiography. Through the book, Raina, with the help of sports writer Bharat Sundaresan, looks back at his life — 13 years of which he spent playing international cricket. He speakson the people and moments he cherishes the most in this journey. M.S. Dhoni Mahi bhai has played a very important role in my life. I will forever be grateful that I got a chance to play with him, under his guidance. I still remember back in 2005, when I first met him for the Duleep Trophy. Though I didn’t get much of a chance to interact with him, I resonated in a lot of ways with him. He was from one of the small towns hoping to make it big in cricket, and so was I. When we started playing, we had the same bond on and off the field: We are both desi in style. He was always down to earth. He didn’t change even when he got into the limelight. For me, he will always be a legendary captain and a fantastic leader. World Cup 2011 Memories of World Cup 2011 still feel so fresh. I missed the World Cup 2007 because of my injury so I had to make sure that I gave my best for 2011, also it was being played in our own country. I was in my best shape during that time and kept working on my fitness. Though I was not the first choice, I didn’t let it get to me. Finally I got a chance to play and contribute to the tournament. It is not a one-day effort that goes behind a tournament but a culmination of a lot of months and the team effort behind it. We were just like a family who wanted to win this trophy. Chennai Super Kings I was making a comeback after my injury when the IPL auctions happened in 2008. I was happy to know that I was with the Chennai Super Kings. All the more reason for my happiness was to know Mahi bhai was in the same team with other great players. I knew this would definitely strengthen our team. Mahi bhai and I bonded more in CSK since we used to explore Chennai in our own way. The people in Chennai started referring to me as ‘ Chinna Thala ’. I also got an opportunity to captain for CSK when Mahi bhai got injured. Yellow is something I wear with a lot of pride and is very close to my heart. Priyanka C. Raina Priyanka and I go a long way back. Our families had known each other before either of us were born. We hadn’t been in touch since school, then in 2008, we met at Mumbai airport. From there our friendship rekindled. She was working overseas but still decided to come back to India for me. She has been an absolute pillar in my life. She has stood by me through all the highs and lows. I draw inspiration from her since she has established herself really well both in her personal and professional life. Marrying her was the best decision I made.  (As told toPraveen Sudevan)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/raina-reminisces/article34959435.ece
25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||What made Umrao Jaan iconic||The cult status of Kamal Amrohi’s Pakeezah (1972) intimidated filmmakers so much that many did not even want to attempt making a film on the life of a courtesan. But nine years later, in 1981, Muzaffar Ali rose to the challenge and adapted the 1905 Urdu novel Umrao Jaan Ada on celluloid, to create his magnum opus, Umrao Jaan . Withstanding inevitable comparisons, the film managed to hold a candle to Pakeezah in every aspect, including art direction, costume design, choreography, music, acting, and direction. Some even assert that it shines brighter. Exquisite work For those who haven’t watched this exquisite work of art, Muzaffar Ali’s period film is a connoisseur’s delight that demands to be visited and revisited. The film tells the story of the eponymous courtesan from Lucknow and portrays her eventful life. In 1840, a girl named Amiran is abducted as a teenager from Faizabad and sold to Khanum Jaan (Shaukat Kaifi), the madam of a brothel in Lucknow. Renamed Umrao Jaan (Rekha), Amiran is trained in all the arts to captivate men of wealth and taste. She experiences love and happiness for a brief period in the company of Nawab Sultan (Farooq Shaikh), but when he is compelled to marry someone else to please his family, it leaves Umrao heartbroken, from which she never recovers. Rekha’s National award-winning performance as Umrao Jaan remains the crowning glory of her career. Her range as an actor is on full display; she portrays shyness, love, affection, seduction, compassion, and pain with utmost ease. Her dance, mannerisms, and expressions in the song sequences continue to be discussed among actors, film scholars and critics. It is believed that she drew upon the turbulent phase in her life at that time for her performance. The painter in Ali accentuated Rekha’s beauty through some mesmerising visuals, juxtaposing pathos with beautiful costumes and jewellery of mid-19th century Lucknow. Ali’s then wife Subhashini (former MP from Kanpur) was in charge of getting the costumes and look right. The immaculate set design and backdrops stand out in Umrao Jaan, for which it won the National Award for Best Art Direction. The attention to detail can be seen in the colourful lanterns, carpets, curtains, furniture and the interiors of the brothels, which brought alive the Nawabi era. Ali was also fortunate to have for reference some great period films like Satyajit Ray’s Shatranj Ke Khilari (1977) and Shyam Benegal’s Junoon (1978), which too had the revolt of 1857 as their backdrop.  Umrao Jaan is remembered to this day primarily for its melodious and soulful ghazals. Regarded as one of the best soundtracks in Hindi cinema, Khayyam won the National Film Award for Best Music Direction. Aided by Shahrya’'s sublime poetry, who first collaborated with Ali in his debut Gaman (1978), the trio are responsible for some of the most cherished songs on screen. Khayyam deserves special mention for introducing ghazal singer Talat Aziz to film music through the love ballad ‘Zindagi jab bhi’. Asha Bhonsle, as the playback voice of Umrao Jaan, immortalised the songs through her heart-wrenching renditions. She received her first National Award for the film’s song, ‘Dil cheez kya hai’. Films like Umrao Jaan are epitomes of art created once in a lifetime. It came at a time when ghazals were making frequent inroads into Hindi film music. The same year came Jagjit Singh’s acclaimed composition ‘Hontho se chu lo tum’ from Prem Geet.  The following year, in 1982, Jagjit mesmerised audiences again with his heart-rending ghazals in Mahesh Bhatt’s Arth and Raman Kumar’s Saath Saath . And Khayyam went on to replicate his success in Sagar Sarhadi’s Bazaar (1982), with its beautiful ghazals like ‘Phir chidi raat’ and ‘Dikhayi diye yun’, among others.  Unfortunately, ghazal in films has become a rarity now, but songs like ‘In aankhon ki masti ke’ has kept the legacy of yesteryear music and classics like Umrao Jaan alive.

25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Music on his own terms||Growing up in the 1980s was not really a great experience — there were shortages of all kinds. But there was one joy that we had in abundance — listening to Maharajapuram Santhanam live. At a time when Carnatic music, like much else in India, was going through something of a decline, he was perhaps the most stellar among a handful of musicians who held the art aloft. Santhanam was born in 1928 as the younger son of Maharajapuram Viswanatha Iyer and Visalakshi. Being the son of a genius is not a passport to success. The father was known for his brilliance and being a true torchbearer of the Umayalpuram school but his career progress had been chequered at best. Santhanam had to carve a space for himself. In any case, it is never easy to scale the same heights as a parent in any profession, more so in the performing arts. While Santhanam began early enough with performances at Tiruvaiyyaru, the Music Academy and elsewhere, he did not make waves. In the 1950s, it was not easy for a young musician to make a name for there were enough stalwarts around. But as was to be characteristic of him, he did something out of the ordinary — established a Sabha! He was keen that there should be one in the T. Nagar area, even though the Thyaga Brahma Gana Sabha was already functioning. The Sri Krishna Gana Sabha came into existence in 1953 with Viswanatha Iyer as its president and Santhanam as the secretary. In later years, he passed on the running of the sabha to R. Yagnaraman, but continued to have a close relationship with the organisation right through his life. The turning point came in 1959-60, when while on a concert tour of Sri Lanka, Viswanatha Iyer was requested to stay back and become the Head of the Department of Music at the Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan College of Music in Jaffna. He suggested his son be given the job. It was there that Santhanam truly evolved, teaching and introspecting on music for five years, between 1960 and 1965. It was still not easy to make a name upon return, and Santhanam dabbled in business. But by the early 1970s, his career had taken off and it would be another four or five years before he became the sensation that we recall.  The Santhanam style had many aspects that attracted audiences and made them adherents. His choice of songs was perhaps the first — while he included many of the weighty pieces from the Umayalpuram stable — he brought in a whole new repertoire that became associated with him. Some of these may not have been great compositions by themselves, but Santhanam gave them a polish that made them popular. He also included a few of his own compositions, which were known for their melody. The audience connect While adhering to the concert format, Santhanam gave the post-Pallavi elements due weightage. He knew that many in the audience came to listen to these lighter songs, but this was never at the cost of the main pieces, that were presented in all their grandeur. This approach drew him closer to rasikas. His was possibly the most pleasing male voice of the time. Santhanam eschewed harsh and loud renditions and when it came to the higher octave modulated his voice to the point where his critics, of whom there were plenty, accused him of crooning. But the audience loved it. I have seen men and women overcome with emotion during these moments in his performances. His raga alapanas and swaras were precise and well structured. And his niraval was an emotional experience for many. Gradually, Santhanam ensured he had a new set of rasikas, who came to listen to the tukkadas and began to enjoy the very format of classical music. Another aspect of Santhanam’s music was the sheer joy that permeated the concert platform. The accompanists and audiences were made to feel part of a happy experience. Santhanam kept the humour flowing. When singing ‘Vilaiyada Idu Nerama’ he would look at his watch. In a tillana with the line ‘Kumara Vaa,’ he would beckon to his son. In one concert, where the requests kept pouring in through chits, he picked one and announced — ‘this person has asked me to sing Mangalam’. As a speaker he was excellent, and humour was his biggest strength. His father’s wit was as famous and when he brought out a commemorative volume on Viswanatha Iyer, he ensured that the pages, apart from laudatory articles, carried a collection of his non-Rabelaisian jokes. He also established a trust in his father’s name that still awards musicians. At the Music Academy, where he received the Sangita Kalanidhi in 1989, it became customary to spread rugs in the car park so that the dozens who could not get into the auditorium were able to watch his concert on the CCTVs outside. As his career rose to great heights, Santhanam demanded and obtained fees that were commensurate with his star status. In this, he was doing a favour to the Carnatic world, which had long suffered (and still suffers) from low remuneration — compensations began to go up because of his intervention. This was attacked tooth and nail by critics, most notably by N. Pattabhiraman of Sruti magazine, who branded him ‘Mahamoney Vidwan’. To detractors such as these, it was a virtue for a Carnatic artiste to remain poor. Anyway, Santhanam was unperturbed. On one memorable occasion, when asked to sing longer, he announced in Tamil that time was up. He used the word ‘mani’ and made a counting gesture. Everyone burst into laughter. “When he was a child, I have carried him around,” said Semmangudi at a felicitation function. Then, looking at Santhanam seated by his side, he said, “Now I cannot even imagine that.” There was laughter but none louder than Santhanam’s. When he died in a car accident on June 24, 1992, it came as a shock to the Carnatic world. He is still missed.     The Chennai-based author, a historian,writes on music and culture.

25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Expanding the movement vocabulary||There is a firm belief among some practitioners of dance in India that a comprehensive and holistic approach to the study of dance is also a multidisciplinary one. The International Bureau of Education defines a ‘multidisciplinary approach’ as one that “focuses primarily on different disciplines and the diverse perspectives they bring to illustrate a topic, theme or issue.” A multidisciplinary curriculum is one “where the same topic is studied from the viewpoint of more than one discipline.” Such an approach to dance, therefore, would include perspectives from more than one movement art. Dance, as is well known, has two dimensions, one bodily or physical and the other mental. So, the multidisciplinary approach to dance is also best viewed as a two-pronged one. First, it concerns the dancing body. Here ‘multidisciplinary’ could mean understanding the bodily aspects of one’s primary dance form through the additional learning of other dance styles or movement disciplines. Learning other forms expands the body’s physical vocabulary and increases its versatility since different dance forms lay stress on different aspects of muscle strength and offer different kinds of body conditioning in terms of flexibility, balance, reflexes, instinctive awareness, breathing, and so on. Several dancers have used this approach to better understand their bodies, strengthen and prepare them for dance, and to expand their vocabulary. Among the earliest would be Uday Shankar, who added elements of European theatre, folk and tribal dances to his innovative style. Sitara Devi and Rukmini Devi studied ballet in addition to their primary disciplines of Kathak and Bharatanatyam, respectively. Chandralekha turned to yoga as early as the 60s in order to “heal” her “dance ravaged” body and later weaved martial and movement arts into her practice. Cross-cultural dancer Uttara Asha Coorlawala and Kathak dancer Daksha Sheth are other prominent dancers to work with yoga and other movement forms. Infusing Kathak with yoga When asked about why she turned to other movement vocabularies, Daksha said, “Kathak was in my body for 20 years” before she saw Chhau and wanted to explore it. “But for a person who has never squatted — we use totally different muscles in Kathak — my body was not capable.” Through injuries, she realised that she needed awareness, conditioning and strengthening. “When I saw a Kalaripayattu demonstration, I thought, this is what I should be learning for a holistic conditioning of my body”. She eventually infused her Kathak choreographies with yoga, Kalaripayattu and Mallakhamb. The second ‘prong’ of the multidisciplinary approach concerns the dancer’s mind. This involves, in a sense, the ‘fitness’ of the mind. When I speak of the mind, I include intellect, but also mindfulness, emotional intelligence, and other aspects — all crucial for dance. This is best done through a process of informing dance with meditative techniques, but also with disciplines like literature, theatre, music, art, philosophy and so on. As I had asserted in an earlier article for this paper written in  2012, “for any kind of dancing, both body and mind must be exercised equally, and used creatively.” Hereditary dancers or ‘devadasis’ definitely appear to have approached their art in a ‘multidisciplinary’ fashion. They were rigorously trained in dance but were also expected to have a significant degree of mastery in other arts, be it music (vocal and instrumental), poetry, languages or literature. These past masters of dance knew that learning multiple disciplines can only enrich their dance and inspire creativity. Like Chandralekha, who drew widely upon sculpture, painting, poetry, literature and philosophy for her dance, Daksha has explored multiple disciplines to create a distinctive contemporary body of work that has been staged to critical acclaim. Recognising the value of such is crucial to classical dance, particularly its pedagogy, especially if the notions that existed when I was a student of dance persist today. With the exception of music, which was considered complementary to dance, true dedication invariably meant a singular focus on the particular form. A deviation into theatre or sport, for instance, was considered an unwarranted distraction. I remember hearing of heartbroken 12-year-olds who were removed from dance productions because they had enrolled into a weekend theatre class or were led to believe that learning another style of dance or performance would contaminate or dilute their ‘pure’ classical training. As understandings of dance, the body, inspiration and creativity evolve, my sincere hope for the Indian classical dance world is that it embraces the most holistic of approaches — a multidisciplinary one. I strongly believe this is the most effective way to transformatively enrich one’s body, mind and practice. This confidence comes not just from my own experience as a dancer and choreographer, but from just a cursory glance at how some legendary artistes used this approach to their advantage. In fact, it may have been the secret to their genius.  The dancer and choreographer is the founder-director of Bangalore-based ‘Vyuti’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/expanding-the-movement-vocabulary/article34959035.ece
25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Evoking the navarasa||Priyadarsini Govind’s ‘Rama Navarasa’ was a restrained and dignified presentation. It stayed in the mind long after the online session was over. In Sri Rama Karnamrtam, the poet describes how Rama experienced Sringara when he saw Sita, felt valorous when he broke the bow, was surprised when the monkeys built the bridge, and angry over Ravana’s evil deeds. Priyadarsini brought out all these emotions clearly, communicating more through her eyes. Priyadarsini, dressed in a grey Kanjeevaram sari, did the abhinaya sequences seated on the floor and with masterly understatement. One could understand and experience Rama at every point. This is what good art is all about — getting the perspective right. The webinar series on Navarasa was conducted for members of NavaDarshana. Rasa in the audience is created through Vibhava (determinants), Anubhava (voluntary responses) and Vyabhichari Bhava (transitory emotions such as stories, etc) — tools of abhinaya used to communicate the sthayi bhava of the composition. An experienced dancer will go beyond the theory to understand a composition and interpret it. Priyadarsini says that a dancer not only expresses but also experiences rasa within. Expressing it right What we think we are expressing may not always be so, as what we think may be different from what we express. Since Bharatanatyam uses a stylised, perhaps even exaggerated, vocabulary of expressions, this is an important point to remember. To highlight another interesting point that we perhaps know intuitively is that what is expressed may be different from what is received, which is the difference between the sthayi bhava and the rasa. Priyadarsini gave an example from the Purananooru , the Sangam poems that speak of kings and warriors. The warrior community sends their children to the battle — veera is the sthayi bhava here, but what the audience experiences is shoka (sadness). Or how sometimes an artiste may do something funny or humorous, but it may invoke shoka in the audience, as Kamal Haasan does in the film Sadma . She repeatedly pointed out that the sthayi bhava should not be seen in isolation and is not generic; it needs shading, with reference to the situation, character, and other factors to add fullness and depth. This is how an artiste builds up the blank canvas of the stage. The dancer demonstrated a few songs, mainly the pallavis, to show how an idea can be conveyed in different ways. ‘Yaarukkagilum bhayama’ is about a woman who is not arrogant but not afraid to be open about her relationship with the king. There was more reticence in ‘Sakhi he,’ where the heroine tells her friend how much she loves Krishna, and an overflowing vatsalya bhava in ‘Thumaka chalata Ramachandra’ between a mother and her son. Thanks to the virtual medium, one could get a clearer view of her nuanced expressions. The crowning glory of Priyadarsini’s presentation was the Rama navarasa sloka, ‘Shringaram kshiti nandini’ from the Sri Rama Karnamrtam , sung by Rithvik Raja in an evocative ragamalika. Her emotions were contained, befitting Rama. Her abhinaya was like a seamless narrative, creating visual poetry.  The Chennai-based author writes on classical dance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/evoking-the-navarasa/article34959040.ece
25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||The portrait of a singer||Shankar Mahadevan of the successful composer-trio Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy and the voice behind many super-hit songs actually trained to be a veena artiste in childhood. While teaching him to play a kriti, his veena guru told him to also sing it in order to execute it well on the veena, thereby setting his singing career in motion. Hitherto unknown facets, such as this, of Shankar's life are what make Decoding Shankar interesting. The documentary, directed by Kochi-based Deepti Pillay Sivan, won Best Biographical Film Award at the Toronto International Women Film Festival, 2021. “The award couldn’t have come at a better time. Like so many others, I was going through a low phase having lost a close relative to COVID. It has instilled hope in me,” says Deepti. Coming from a family that prioritised academics over artistic exploits, Deepti often found herself mentioning Shankar Mahadevan’s example. The singer left a lucrative career in software to pursue his passion for music. “I thought the best way to drive home my point was by making a film on him. Shankar’s mother played an important role in nurturing his talent. If not for her, the world would not have known Shankar Mahadevan the singer,” says Deepti. Not a biopic Deepti’s film is as much Shankar’s biography as it is about decoding playback singing. Once ridiculed by the West, it is now seen as a uniquely Indian cultural phenomenon. In the documentary, Shankar talks about the classical notes that shape a song. He chooses some popular songs composed by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy to demonstrate how they are rooted in classical music. Unlike other biographical films, Deepti chose to have the story narrated by the protagonist himself. So Shankar holds forth on his childhood, the dilemma he faced before quitting his job, entering the world of jingles and, finally, making it as a musician. Shankar’s mother recalls how her husband insisted he complete his engineering degree, while she encouraged him to pursue music, sometimes even carrying his veena so that he could attend class after school. Shankar’s wife Sangeetha, his junior at school, recalls the initial days of their marriage and says they struggled to find time for themselves as Shankar would often be recording without a break. Casting coup It was nothing less than a casting coup when Deepti roped in Amitabh Bachchan, Gulzar, Javed Akhtar, Farhan Akhtar, Aamir Khan, Zakir Hussain, Shreya Ghoshal, Sachin Tendulkar and top admen Prahlad Kakkar and Prasoon Pandey to talk about their association with Shankar, along with Ehsaan and Loy. “I wanted to have on board people whose work has been impacted by Shankar’s music. Sachin and Shankar share a great bonding as Shankar had composed and sung a poem written by Sachin’s father.” Deepti’s husband Sanjeev Sivan is the brother of cinematographers Santosh and Sangeeth Sivan, and he staunchly supported her work. “I consider Sanjeev my guru,” she says. “Considering I belong to a family of acclaimed technicians, my husband made sure the film remained my own, with no assistance from any of them. He offered to take care of the children while I was busy shooting.” Deepti took two and a half years to complete the film, and delivered her third child during its making. Versatility and verve A management and law graduate, Deepti held varied roles in the media and entertainment industry, and also acted in the Malayalam film Kalippattam .  Decoding Shankar was screened at the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) at Goa and other festivals, including Stuttgart in Germany; Jecheon International Music and Film Festival, South Korea; and DC South Asian Film Festival, Gaithersburg. . While talks are on to release Decoding Shankar on an OTT platform, Deepti is planning a web series with Sanjeev on the Padmanabhaswamy temple and a film on the defence forces.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/the-portrait-of-a-singer/article34959049.ece
25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||The art and science of tambura||You take an unassuming piece of wood and attach strings to it, and with the right kind of care, construction, and cultural evolution, it can come to produce a resonance that mirrors the very substratum of existence — like molecules, planets, and humans live and flourish on the nurturing gravy of eternal space, so do swaras, ragas, and melodies dance on the auditory fabric woven by the tambura’s mesmeric drone. When classical vocalist Ranjani Sivakumar logged on to the call to delve into the “exceptional qualities of this ancient and sonorous instrument” in a brief and enriching meeting organised by Dhvani Ohio, she had an entire narrative planned, she says. But that went for a toss when she saw the demographic of the attendees. The subject matter of the lecture-demonstration, ‘The Song of the Tambura’, promised to be a highly technical and academic one, involving at least a dozen references to psycho-acoustics, Quasi Helmholtz motion, and Pythagorean Commas. But her audience of around 40 participants was largely youngsters. And so, her tone and delivery took on a cherubic and tender quality as she slowed it down to ensure that the kids first made friends with the bulbous instrument before being introduced to its nitty-gritties, its “art and science”. “I had made extensive notes. I saw many children, so I quickly changed it. I wanted them to retain a sense of wonder around sound, instrument, and music. So many theoretical aspects fall into place naturally as they are being curious,” explains Ranjani, who has taught music at outdoor camps and alternative schools. Ranjani got hands-on, picking up a 4kg Miraj tanpura and thrusting every nook and cranny of the giant instrument into the web-cam lens to point out how the sound from the plucked strings travels from the peg-laden Langot all along the giraffe-like Dand to the mediating Guruch and bounces into the scooped-gourd belly of the Thumba after being amplified by the Jeev thread on the sound board. Just shows how important it is to incorporate intimacy and engagement in didactic methods for effective transfer of knowledge and cultivation of interest. Subtle dynamics No foray into the instrument’s nature can be made without an elucidation of its subtle string dynamics. Its unique sound is strongly influenced by minor physical aspects you could easily deem acoustically insignificant. Using a lid and rubber bands of varied tautness, Ranjani demonstrates the relationship between pitch and string tension. Once the fundamental concept has landed, she swiftly proceeds to talk about more nuanced facets. The instrument’s rich timbre and buzzing vibrance, called Jawāri , is produced by a tiny little thread that makes the strings have a “grazing contact” with the surface of a bridge made of materials as free-ranging as wood, ebony or camel bone. Sir C.V. Raman’s curiosity was kindled by the spectral auditory hues, called harmonics or overtones, that formed around each fundamental note and differentiated its effervescent tonality from that of most other plucked lute-like string instruments. One cannot say that Ranjani was able to plumb the depths of the instrument during the session. After all, one-and-a-half hours is hardly enough to scratch the surface of an instrument with a history as eclectic, a design as intricate, a presence as essential, and a musicality as quintessential as the tambura’s. While most of its genealogical cousins — the Uyghur Tambur, the Kurdish Tembur, or the Persian Tanbur — have grown into standalone and accompanying instruments that play melodies and tunes of their own, the Indian subcontinental version has retained a gravitas about it, deigning only to provide a weighty harmonic backdrop to Hindustani and Carnatic compositional forms . There’s something very compassionate and spiritual about a sound that wishes to tell no stories of its own, but only be the canvas for a myriad tales. A little like the Internet — that great digital canvas that has sustained and nestled most of human activity as COVID-19 roams the great outdoors. Ranjani is cautious but sanguine: “We must be grateful for an online option to fall back on, and surely we have learned enough to adapt — small concert spaces have mushroomed and offer recording options. The shift has made it possible to reach any corner.” Then again, she stresses that we need the organic benefits of music — between laments of several artistes switching to electronic tambura because the bulky instrument calls for care, maintenance, and painstaking tuning, and today’s listeners sipping concerts from their tinny phone speakers and miss out on the true live experience, she also emphasises the meditative properties of music that can be accessed only with focussed and non-superficial engagement with the music.

25 June 2021||CHANDIGARH,||No let-up in infighting within Punjab Cong.||There seems to be no let up in the infighting within the Punjab Congress as the controversy surrounding government jobs for children of two Congress legislators on ‘compassionate grounds’ by the State government refuses to die down. Congress MLA Fatehjang Singh Bajwa on Thursday turned down the government job offer for his son Arjun Pratap Singh Bajwa, saying that the family decided to decline the job offer amid the ‘petty politics’ being played on the issue. He alleged that the opposition parties and some members of the Congress were playing cheap politics. “Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa’s (Minister) son is the Gurdaspur zila parishad chairman, Sukhbinder Sarkaria’s (Minister) nephew is the chairman of the Amritsar zila parishad and Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar’s nephew is the chairman of the Punjab State Farmers’ Commission,” he pointed out. Last week, the Punjab Cabinet as a special case, gave approval to appoint Arjun Pratap Singh Bajwa as an Inspector in the Punjab police. The Cabinet said the applicant is the grandson of ex-Punjab Minister Satnam Singh Bajwa, who laid down his life in 1987 for the sake of peace and harmony in the State. Mr. Arjun is son of Fatehjang Singh Bajwa, the Congress MLA from Qadian. The Cabinet also gave the nod to the appointment of Bhisham Pandey, the grandson of Joginder Pal Pandey who was gunned down by terrorists in 1987, as a Naib Tehsildar in Revenue Department. Mr. Bhisham is son of Rakesh Pandey, MLA from Ludhiana. ‘Policy to continue’ Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had stated that children, grandchildren of such people would continue to be considered by his government for compensatory appointment on case-to-case basis. Rubbishing questioning by the ‘Bajwa family’ on appointment of Ajay Vir Jakhar as chairman of Punjab State Farmers’ Commission, Mr. Jakhar said that Ajay Vir did not draw any salary or other emoluments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/no-let-up-in-infighting-within-punjab-cong/article34959292.ece
25 June 2021||New Delhi,||‘24 containment zones out of 4,340 have active COVID-19 cases’||Delhi has 4,340 active containment zones but only 1,797 active COVID-19 cases, according to government data till June 22. The number of such zones is higher as an area can be removed from the list of containment zones only after a 28-day period of no new COVID-19 cases being reported from the same place, as per officials. “We can delist a containment zone only 28 days after the last positive case as per Central government rules. So, even if currently there are no active cases, we cannot delist that area. But we start de-escalation process after 14 days from the last positive case and people can start moving in and out of the containment zone after 14 days,” an official said. A district-wise breakup of data showed that there was a total of only 998 active cases. The government did not explain why it is less than the official bulletin data of 1,797 active cases. Of these 998 active cases, the Central district has the highest number of containment zones — 2,253 containment zones for just 37 active cases — while the east district has the lowest, just one containment zone for 29 active cases, as per the data. “Presently there are only 24 containment zones with active COVID-19 cases and the rest have zero active cases. But these can be delisted only 14 days after recovery of the last case in the respective containment zone [roughly 28 days from last case being reported]. That is why active containment zones are more than the active cases,” a Delhi government official said. The official said almost all containment zones are “micro containment zones” and in many cases one or two houses. “In the beginning of the pandemic, we used to make very large containment zones, but for the past many months the focus is on micro containment zones and in many cases, it is just one house,” the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/24-containment-zones-out-of-4340-have-active-covid-19-cases/article34959315.ece

He also laid special emphasis on the deployment of an emergency response team comprising Chief Engineers and Superintendent Engineers who will draft special task plans for critical areas under their jurisdiction in consultation with area MLAs and site visits. “These plans will then be submitted to Member [Water] for verification and further necessary action. On execution of this plan, it is expected that the number of complaints that DJB receives will reduce,” Mr. Chadha said. “All Chief Engineers are required to visit their respective areas that are facing problems, along with the area MLAs, and formulate a working plan to sort out all the water issues and submit weekly reports to the Vice Chairperson’s Office regarding the ongoing development,” he added. Mr. Chadha said a road map for water supply in the Capital based on the “supply-demand model” on important parameters such as population and per capita usage is the key for maximum consumer satisfaction. “We need to find a way to supply the available raw water in an equitable way either through a piped network or additional tanker trips. Delhi Jal Board’s officers need to ensure that the complaints received are redressed promptly without fail,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/set-up-emergency-response-team-to-resolve-complaints-chadha-to-officials/article34959313.ece
25 June 2021||New Delhi,||Man serving jail term in POCSO case allowed to attend brother’s wedding||The Delhi High Court permitted a man, serving a 10-year rigorous jail term in a Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) case, to attend a wedding ceremony. Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani directed that the applicant be taken in custody by jail or police officers in plain clothes to let him attend the marriage function of his elder brother from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Thursday. Advocate Aishwarya Rao, representing the man, argued that though this application was moved earlier, it has been listed now since he has approached the court through the jail-visiting counsel of the Delhi High Court Legal Services Committee. The Additional Public Prosecutor argued a pre-verification of the ground cited for interim suspension of the sentence was made and it stands confirmed that the man’s elder brother is scheduled to be married on June 24. The Additional Public Prosecutor, however, submitted that verification from the to-be bride’s family could not be completed as the man’s father dissuaded the police officer from conducting verification from her family, saying if they find out that the applicant is in prison, they may not go ahead with the marriage. With the Additional Public Prosecutor citing no objection to the arrangement, the court allowed the man to attend the wedding. He is yet to serve 7 years and 8 months jail term. The court had earlier dismissed his interim bail application on the ground that he had furnished wrong information.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/man-serving-jail-term-in-pocso-case-allowed-to-attend-brothers-wedding/article34959305.ece
25 June 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi court denies bail in gang-rape case, terms allegations ‘very grave’||A Delhi court on Thursday denied bail to an accused in a gang-rape case, saying the allegations against him were grave and he may flee if allowed to come out of jail. Accused Ajay Gupta allegedly lured a woman hailing from Rajasthan with a gold chain and earrings, took her to a hut of a co-accused where six people took turns to rape her, Delhi Police said. Junking his bail plea, Additional Sessions Judge Rajesh Malik observed, “Gravity of the offence is reflected from the fact that she was spotted by the accused and they took her to their jhuggi. They made her drink and took turns to rape her. The allegations are very grave.” The judge also said there was likelihood that the accused may influence prosecution witnesses or flee from justice considering the serious nature of allegations, and hence no case to release him on bail is made out. Counsel for the accused submitted that there are contradictions in woman’s statement and that a false story has been cooked up to frame his client. “Her husband contradicted her by stating that they had reached Delhi by bus, whereas, she mentioned in the FIR that she had reached Delhi by train,” the counsel said. He also said the woman had no injury mark at the time of her medical examination, whereas, she alleged that she was raped.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-court-denies-bail-in-gang-rape-case-terms-allegations-very-grave/article34959307.ece
25 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Notices served to Google to remove certain apps||Delhi Police’s Cyber Cell served notices to Google to remove apps from the play store that are being operated from outside the country and offering multiple financial investments with high returns, said an officer on Thursday. The officer said an FIR was registered against the apps — Power Bank and EZPlan. This comes after the police on June 10 busted a syndicate run by a group of Chinese nationals who cheated more than 5 lakh Indians of over Rs. 150 crore via fake investment apps. “We had arrested the person responsible for sending pre-activated Indian SIM cards to China for the scam. More than 50 digital devices used in the offence have been seized,” said the officer. He added that during probe, it was found that more than Rs. 13 crore have been moved out of the country through Cryptocurrency via Cryto Currency Exchanges. The apps identified in the scam have been found linked to Chinese servers and seven Chinese nationals — part of the scam — have been identified. “The gang sued to contact and recruit random people over WhatsApp and Telegram. In a similar way, several other apps are operating and luring small investors. They used the Multilevel marketing (MLM) model for cheating and approaching people on various social media platforms. Several other virtual bank account addresses have been traced, which were linked with the crypto exchanges and money was transferred through those accounts as well. Details are being sought from Crypto Exchanges. We are tracing money trail to identify more accused involved in the scam,” said the officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/notices-served-to-google-to-remove-certain-apps/article34959320.ece
25 June 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||CM Patnaik announces aid for dairy farmers||Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Thursday announced COVID-19 assistance for dairy farmers registered under the Odisha State Cooperative Milk Producers’ Federation (OMFED). According to the State government, 1,20,000 farmers would receive a maximum Rs. 6,000 each towards fodder costs resulting in Rs. 11 crore expenditure. During the lockdown, the farmers suffered a lot as sweetmeat shops, restaurants and tea shops, which are major end users of milk, remained closed. Farmers were seen pouring milk on roads protesting against non-procurement. “The pandemic has adversely impacted the economy of the world and Odisha is no exception. While all sectors fared badly, agriculture and allied sector sustained the economy. Farmers continued their work without giving up,” said Mr. Patnaik in a statement. Dairy farming plays an important role in the rural economy contributing to livelihoods of small and marginal farmers, he said. “Since demand for milk has come down drastically, it had impacted the livelihood of dairy farmers in a big way. Keeping this in mind, it has been decided to provide financial assistance to dairy farmers,” he said. The Congress had earlier demanded monthly assistance of Rs. 6,000 to every milk farmer during the lockdown period. Procurement, which was around 5.45 lakh litre per day, ranged between 3.75 lakh LPD and 2 lakh LPD at one point of time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cm-patnaik-announces-aid-for-dairy-farmers/article34959289.ece
25 June 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||NHAI seeks Odisha govt.’s nod for coastal highway||The National Highway Authority of India has sought Odisha government’s consent for the 384 km ambitious coastal highway project, which will connect Odisha’s Tangi with West Bengal’s Digha. Six years after the project was first mooted, the proposed coastal highway under Bharatmala Pariyojana has not made much headway. The major hurdle was environmental concerns. The road was initially planned through ecologically sensitive Chilika, Balukhanda Konark Wildlife Sanctuary, Bhitarakanika Sanctuary Area and some of the important Olive Ridley turtle nesting sites. After environmentalists raised an alarm, a long bridge proposed over Chilika was shelved, and subsequently Chilika was struck off from the plan. The highway, which was initially planned from Gopalpur of Ganjam district, will now begin from Tangi in Khordha district. Greenfield project “We have carried out a realignment to avoid disturbance to coastal biodiversity zones. The road is a green-field project. Some portions of the existing roads near Puri will be part of the highway, otherwise we will have to acquire both private and government land for the project,” said Ram Prasad Panda, Chief General Manager of NHAI, Bhubaneswar. “Some portions the highway project will require approval under coastal regulation zone guidelines,” Mr. Panda said. Presentation on realignment of the proposed road was presented before the State government earlier this week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/nhai-seeks-odisha-govts-nod-for-coastal-highway/article34959290.ece
25 June 2021||Special Correspondent,||Cong. leader’s remarks against Shekhawat create flutter||The remarks of Congress Chief Whip in Rajasthan Assembly Mahesh Joshi describing Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat as a ‘fugitive’ created a flutter in the political circles here on Thursday. In its sharp reaction, the Opposition BJP said the ruling party’s leaders were touching a new low in politics in the State. Mr. Joshi, who was summoned by the Delhi police crime branch to appear before it for questioning in a phone-tapping case registered on Mr. Shekhawat’s complaint, said it was the Union Minister who was running away from giving voice samples to the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) for a probe into the audio clips of conversation about toppling the State government last year. “If Mr. Shekhawat is clean, why is he running away? He is a fugitive on moral grounds. He should appear before the ACB and give his voice samples,” Mr. Joshi told reporters outside the PCC headquarters here. After his remarks, the Congress workers started raising slogans against Mr. Shekhawat, calling him a ‘bhagoda’ (fugitive). Mr. Shekhawat is the Lok Sabha MP elected from Jodhpur. Mr. Joshi has refused to appear before the crime branch in Delhi, saying he was not named in the FIR registered in March this year, while the matter related to the jurisdiction of the case was pending before a court in the national capital. He said the notice of the crime branch was “legally untenable” because no person above 65 years of age could be called to a police station for recording of statement. The audio clips of alleged telephonic conversations between Mr. Shekhawat and Congress leaders had surfaced during the political crisis in July last year, when then Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot, along with 18 MLAs supporting him, staged a rebellion. Mr. Joshi had lodged the cases with the ACB and the Special Operations Group of the Rajasthan police on the basis of the audio clips. ‘Indecent remarks’ State BJP president Satish Poonia said Mr. Joshi's “indecent remarks” had shown that the Congress leaders, who had stooped to a new low, were not interested any more in ideological fights in politics.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cong-leaders-remarks-against-shekhawat-create-flutter/article34959294.ece

He said this at the first outreach meeting between the Union government and mainstream political leaders of Jammu and Kashmir — a meeting, which by all accounts, was held in a cordial atmosphere. Both Mr. Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah reiterated their previous public commitments to restoring statehood, government sources said. The sources said in his address, Mr. Modi said, “ Dilli ki doori kam honi chahiye aur dil ki doori bhi ” (The distance from Delhi — the seat of central power — and the distance between hearts should both be reduced) to convey the spirit in which the meeting was called. While every party spoke about the restoration of statehood, the contentious issue of special status to Jammu and Kashmir, which was removed by the reading down of Article 370, was also raised but many parties spoke of it as a legal fight as the matter is being heard in the Supreme Court. After the meeting, Mr. Modi indicated that it was the first of such outreach efforts, tweeting: “Today’s meeting ... is an important step in the ongoing efforts towards a developed and progressive Jammu and Kashmir.” He added that “delimitation has to happen at a quick pace so that polls can happen and J&K gets an elected government that gives strength to its development trajectory.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/pm-backs-delimitation-exercise-grassroots-democracy-in-jk/article34959137.ece

The lifeline of the districts — private stage carriage buses — however, are yet to commence their services in a full-fledged manner even as the Karnataka State Transport Corporation (KSRTC) has resumed services based on demand. While normal activities are permitted in Dakshina Kannada district between 7 a.m. and 1 p.m. (by 2 p.m. everything has to shut down), such activities go on till 5 p.m. in Udupi district. Owners and operators of non-essential services and shops have cleaned up their premises and are awaiting customers even as people are coming out cautiously to conduct routine business. KSRTC, said its Mangaluru Divisional Controller Arun Kumar, has deployed over 160 vehicles in Mangaluru and Udupi regions as on Thursday and operating services on important sectors, including Udupi-Mangaluru, Udupi-Karkala and Udupi-Kundapur, besides operating some long-distance services, including those to Bengaluru and North Karnataka regions, to their regular timetable. City buses in Mangaluru have started operations on important routes, he added. Operators of non-essential shops as categorised by the government, including textile, jewellery, stationery, electronic, home appliances, footwear and other similar items, have almost reopened in the two districts even though the footfall is fewer. While a few private bus operators have resumed services in Udupi district on skeletal basis, very few have deployed their buses in Dakshina Kannada district. Having surrendered bus permits after public transport was banned during the lockdown, the owners are now vary of resuming services at the end of the month considering the full road tax component. This, despite Deputy Chief Minister Lakshman C.

The logs had been kept in private coffee plantations at Mukkamkunnu, Makkyanikunnu and Pakkam, near Vazhavatta, in Muttil South Village after felling it reportedly from revenue pattaya land, Forest Department sources said. “As measuring of the timber logs is under way, the exact figure can be ascertained only after the assessment,” a source said.

The forest officials had also seized 202 cubic feet of rosewood illegally axed from revenue pattaya land under the village and shifted it to the Kuppady timber depot nearly four months ago. The massive rosewood-felling came to light after the Forest Department officials seized 54 pieces of illegal rosewood timber worth Rs. 60 lakh from a saw mill at Perumbavoor in Ernakulam district on February 9. The wood was transported from Wayanad to the saw mill without valid documents and the seizure was made on the basis of a tip-off.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/more-rosewood-logs-seized-in-wayanad/article34959390.ece
25 June 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||Government cancels SSC, Intermediate Board exams||The State government has cancelled the SSC (10th Class) and Intermediate Board examinations. Education Minister Adimulapu Suresh told a press conference that following the Supreme Court direction to complete the entire process of the examinations, including the declaration of results by July 31, the State was left with no choice but to cancel the exams. The Minister said after reviewing the apex court’s ruling with the officials of the School Education Department and the Board of Intermediate Education, it was decided to cancel the exams. “We have only Intermediate final year practical exam marks of the students available with us. A high power committee will be constituted to evolve patterns to be adopted for evaluation and allocation of marks,” said the Minister. Responding to a reporter’s remark on government’s “indecisiveness” on conduct of the exams, Mr. Suresh said there was no ambiguity on the government stand on the issue from the beginning. ‘Always in favour’ “We were always in favour of conducting the examinations keeping in view the students’ academic future. We mentioned the same in the affidavit filed in the Supreme Court. But now that the apex court has fixed a deadline of 10 days and it is not possible to complete the entire examination process by July 31, we have decided to drop the exams,” Mr. Suresh said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ap-cancels-intermediate-ssc-exams/article34959113.ece
25 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Notify Class 12 assessment plan, SC tells State Boards||The Supreme Court on Thursday directed State Boards to notify their respective schemes for internal assessment of the final marks of Class 12 students within the next 10 days and ordered them to declare the results by July 31. A Bench of Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari refused to entertain a plea for a “uniform scheme” of assessment to be made applicable across Boards in the country. The court said each Board, whether the CBSE, ICSE or State Boards, was “autonomous and independent”. They could formulate their own schemes after consultation with experts. However, the Bench clarified that allowing Boards to form their own independent schemes did not preclude the court from judicially reviewing their correctness and validity when an occasion arose. By directing the State Boards to declare their results before July 31, the court ensured that students across the country get a level playing field in college admissions and other opportunities for higher studies. Earlier, the CBSE and the ICSE had agreed in the Supreme Court to announce the internal assessment results of their Class 12 students by July 31.

25 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC refuses to intervene in Class 11 exams||The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to intervene in a petition filed by students to cancel the Class 11 examinations in Kerala due to the COVID-19 pandemic and evaluate marks via an internal assessment scheme. A Bench of Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari gave the students the liberty to approach the Kerala High Court with their plea. Advocate G. Prakash, for Kerala, said Class 11 examinations were scheduled in September. Class 11 marks were not relevant for college admissions in 2021. These marks would only be considered in 2022 when they are combined with the Class 12 marks. Mr. Prakash said Kerala had already conducted the Class 12 examinations in April. Advocate Prashant Padmanabhan, appearing for the students, said holding Class 11 examinations later in the year, September as planned or later depending on the COVID-19 situation, would put students under unnecessary pressure. The court said the aggrieved Class 11 students were “free to file substantive writ petition before the High Court raising all contentions available to them. The same are kept open. The High Court may decide the grievance on its own merits.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-refuses-to-intervene-in-class-11-exams/article34959384.ece
25 June 2021||Kochi,||ED moves HC against judicial probe into bid to implicate CM||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday moved the High Court against the Kerala government’s decision to establish a judicial commission of inquiry to examine the alleged attempt on the part of the agency to implicate Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the diplomatic baggage gold smuggling case. The ED’s contention has set the stage for a legal wrangle between the Centre and State over the jurisdictional boundary in a federal set-up. The litigation has political overtones. Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh had said the bid to investigate a Central agency would weaken the federal structure. Mr. Singh had pointed out that Mr. Vijayan had sought a Central investigation into the crime in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In an explanatory note issued in May, the government had said the Customs and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had discarded professionalism and pursued a path of political partisanship to ensnare the Chief Minister in criminal cases. The officers had strayed from their original purpose of finding the source of the contraband gold, its intended recipients and those who facilitated and profited from the racket. Instead, it had coerced the accused to implicate Mr. Vijayan in the case falsely, the note said. ‘Overstepping limits’ The ED contended that the State government had overstepped its jurisdiction. It portrayed the commission as an attempt to stifle the ongoing investigation against those who had abetted the money-laundering aspect of the crime that primarily involved smuggling gold via the diplomatic channel of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram during the 2019-20 period. The ED pointed out that the former Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister was the fifth accused in the case. Earlier in April, the High Court had quashed two FIRs registered by the State police against ED officials on the charge of coercing the accused to give false statements against the Chief Minister and his office. An ED official said money laundering was a Union subject. Hence, the State government had overstepped its constitutional bounds by instituting a judicial probe against the ED. A State official said the terms of reference of the commissioner of enquiry did not cover the money laundering offence. It only looked into the conspiracy to implicate Chief Minister in the case. Law and order was a State subject, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ed-moves-hc-against-judicial-probe-into-bid-to-implicate-cm/article34959386.ece

25 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Court flays govt. over plan to hold exams||The Andhra Pradesh government’s insistence to have its students brave the pandemic to attend Intermediate exams saw the Supreme Court adopt a hard line on Thursday, saying the State will be held responsible and even be made to pay Rs. 1 crore as compensation in case of deaths. A Bench of Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari asked the Andhra Pradesh government what it was trying to prove by risking lives when other States across the country had opted to cancel their State Board exams. “Are you trying to prove you are different? Nobody should try to prove anything here… This is about lives,” Justice Maheshwari addressed advocate Mahfooz A. Nazki, for Andhra Pradesh. “Unless we are convinced that you will be able to conduct exams without any fatality, we will not allow this exam to be held. When other Boards have cancelled their exam, you want to prove you can… are you trying to do that?” Justice Khanwilkar asked. Justice Khanwilkar said the “State will be responsible for any fatality… Remember, there are States which pay Rs. 1 crore to frontline workers, we will have to think something on those terms in your case”. The court grilled the State about the ambiguity of its eight-page affidavit on the why and how it plans to conduct the exams by July-end amid the pandemic. “Have you not seen there is a new variant of the virus called ‘Delta Plus’… The Centre has said that some States — Kerala, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh — are more prone to this variant… We don’t know how this is going to pan out… We cannot say, neither can you, what will happen by the end of July,” Justice Khanwilkar highlighted the uncertainty written large in Andhra’s exam plans. Seating The court asked the State to explain the statement in its affidavit that it would seat only 15 to 18 students in every exam hall. “You say you have 5.19 lakh students taking the Class 12 exams. Simple maths shows you will need 34,634 rooms if you seat 15 students to a class and 28,864 rooms for 18 students to a room. Do you have the space for that or are you planning to conduct exams in the open? Show us a screenshot of your records on the decision… The rooms, again, should be well-ventilated. Besides, you will need over 34,000 invigilators… You have made statements in the affidavit without showing us how you arrived at this decision or how you plan to carry it out,” Justice Khanwilkar told the State government side. The court asked whether the State had a “contingency plan” if the COVID situation got worse midway through the conduct of the exams. Justice Khanwilkar asked when the State would declare the results if it intended to conduct exams only by July-end. “Students in CBSE, ICSE and other Boards would get admissions, your students would be left out,” Justice Khanwilkar said. Mr. Nazki said he would take instructions on the issues flagged by the court. The Bench scheduled a hearing on June 25 at 2 p.m.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/supreme-court-pans-ap-govt-over-plan-to-hold-class-12-exams/article34959116.ece
25 June 2021||GURUGRAM,||Farmers to observe ‘Save democracy day’||The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a coalition of hundreds of farmer unions, will observe June 26 as “Save Agriculture and Save Democracy Day” to mark the 46th year of Emergency and seven months of their ongoing agitation against the Centre’s farm reform laws. Making this announcement at a press conference in Rohtak on Thursday, the SKM leaders said that farmers across the country would protest outside Raj Bhavans on June 26 and submit a memorandum to President Ram Nath Kovind through the Governors. Swaraj India national president Yogendra Yadav, addressing the press conference, said under the Narendra Modi government Emergency has become the new normal and it has become imperative for the farmers’ movement to save democracy along with seeking the repeal of the three laws and guarantee for Minimum Support Price. ‘History repeating itself’ All India Kisan Sabha, Haryana, vice-president Inderjit Singh said history is ironically repeating itself as the same BJP leaders, who had been projecting themselves as victims of Emergency all these years, are now running the country under “undeclared Emergency”. Himself a Maintenance of Internal Security Act detenue in 1976, Mr. Singh cited how the Constitution was systematically subverted by the BJP. Farmer leader Prem Singh Gehlawat recalled how Prime Minister Narendra Modi had “deceived” the people with populist slogans before the elections and was now “blatantly serving the corporate sector at the cost of toiling people”. Satyawan, another farmer leader, said agriculturists from Haryana would assemble at Nadda Saheb Gurdwara before marching towards Raj Bhavan to submit the memorandum urging the President to prevail upon the Union government to amicably settle their demands.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/farmers-to-observe-save-democracy-day/article34959276.ece
25 June 2021||Chennai,||Kattur village achieves 100% coverage with first dose of COVID-19 vaccine||All eligible residents of Kattur village in Tiruvarur district have been vaccinated against COVID-19, making it a model village for Tamil Nadu, Minister for Medical and Family Welfare Ma. Subramanian said. All 2,334 eligible beneficiaries of the village have received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccines. “The village in Koradacheri block has a total population of 3,332. A total of 998 persons were excluded - persons aged less than 18 years, pregnant women and those who cannot take the vaccine on the basis of medical conditions. The remaining 2,334 eligible beneficiaries have been vaccinated, and this is a model village for the State,” he told reporters on Thursday. He said that Tiruvarur MLA ‘Poondi’ Kalaivanan had taken up the initiative to achieve 100% vaccination and created awareness among the residents. This was the village where a memorial of former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi was coming up. At the national level, Weyan village in Bandipora district in Jammu and Kashmir had earlier achieved 100% vaccination coverage, Mr. Subramanian said. The Minister said that in every district, the government had decided to prioritise vaccination of persons residing in villages near tourism destinations where public converge and places where there are memorials. “Accordingly, work to vaccinate all tribals and tea estate workers in the Nilgiris is in progress. All of them will be vaccinated in 10 days,” he added. Similarly, the government was aiming to achieve 100% vaccination in districts with less population such as the Nilgiris and Ariyalur, he said.  On patients covered under Chief Minister’s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme (CMCHIS), he said from March 23, 2020 to May 6, 2021, a total of 1,466 persons were covered under the scheme with an approved amount of Rs. 6.95 crore. “After the DMK government took over on May 7, a total of 20,938 beneficiaries were covered under CMCHIS till June 23. The approved amount was around Rs. 266 crore. There was an appeal to include patients affected with mucormycosis under CMCHIS. Accordingly, a total of 423 persons affected with mucormycosis were treated under the scheme, with the approved amount being Rs. 1.27 crore,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/kattur-village-achieves-100-coverage-with-first-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine/article34959245.ece
25 June 2021||Navi Mumbai,||Thousands protest over naming of airport||Thousands of people from Raigad, Thane and Palghar districts of Maharashtra gathered on Palm Beach Road and staged a protest on Thursday demanding that the under-construction Navi Mumbai international airport be named after the late Peasants and Workers’ Party (PWP) leader and parliamentarian Dinkar Balu Patil, who was popularly known as D.B. Patil, by August 15. Protesters from Uran, Panvel, Thane and Mumbai converged on Palm Beach Road and near Killa junction outside the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation headquarters. The demonstrators, including project affected people, registered their protest over a proposal to name the airport after Shiv Sena founder late Bal Thackeray by dancing, playing musical instruments, and performing Vatt pooja. “The performances are part of our culture and it was showcased to display our unity against this decision. Just like our art and culture, D.B. Patil too is an integral part of our lives. Whatever we are today is because of his struggle for the project affected people of Navi Mumbai. We are the sons of the soil and the government cannot ignore our pleas,” said a protester from Uran. The protesters also raised slogans against the State-run City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO), which is executing the project. The core members of the All Party Action Committee visited CIDCO Bhavan and submitted a letter demanding scrapping of the proposal to name the airport after Bal Thackeray, which was sanctioned in its board meeting. The members threatened to stop construction of the greenfield project if the demand was not met by August 15. In December last year, State Urban Development Minister Eknath Shinde had written to the CIDCO, directing it to send a proposal to name the airport after the late Sena supremo. The proposal was subsequently granted sanction at a meeting of the CIDCO’s board members. On June 10, the State government also announced that the proposed airport would be named after Bal Thackeray. Dashrath Patil, president of the All Party Action Committee, said, “CIDCO is just a puppet and is doing what the government wants. We respect Balasaheb Thackeray, but this airport is coming up on the land of project affected people and it has to be named after the one who fought for their rights.” Heavy police deployment Till 4 p.m., the Sion-Panvel Highway and Palm Beach Road were barricaded by over 8,000 police personnel who manned the traffic and controlled the protestors. Deputy Commissioner of Police, Traffic, Purushottam Karad, said, “Traffic was diverted on Sion Panvel Highway and protesters were prevented from crowding the road, which was closed from 8 a.m. Heavy bandobast was deployed on Palm Beach Road and the stretch from NRI junction to Killa junction was shut. No untoward incidents were reported.” The protesters went ahead with the agitation even though the police had denied them permission and a curfew was imposed in the city. “It was D.B. Patil’s death anniversary and hence we had decided to carry out the protest on June 24. Now, we are giving time to the government, but only till August 15. If the government does not name the airport after D.B. Patil. then the sons of the soil will not allow any work to take place at the airport site,” Prashant Thakur, an MLA from Panvel, said.  We respect Bal Thackeray, but this airport is coming up on the land of project affected people and it has to be named after the one who fought for their rights Dashrath Patil President, All Party Action Committee||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/thousands-protest-over-naming-of-airport/article34959517.ece
25 June 2021||Mumbai,||Unlock without compromising safety: CM||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday asked District Collectors not to be hasty in lifting COVID-19 restrictions in their respective areas and take adequate steps to unlock only after conducting a detailed study of the situation. “We have yet not come out of the second wave of the pandemic and the third wave may hit us all soon. Even though we have given rights to the local administration to decide on unlocking, any decision should be taken without compromising safety,” Mr. Thackeray said in a meeting with the District Collectors of Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur and Hingoli. These seven districts continue to record higher test positivity rates and spikes in COVID-19 cases. Referring to the five levels of unlocking set by the State government, Mr. Thackeray said if people were going to use these levels as an excuse to go out and crowd market places, it would lead to an increase in the number of infections. “Do not rush to unlock. We have taken a hard hit in the second wave, especially due to the shortage of oxygen. Do make the necessary arrangements as well as medical equipment in urban and rural areas,” the Chief Minister said. State Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte said the seven districts could turn out to be a reason for worry for the entire State, and it was important to increase the number of COVID-19 tests and improve contact tracing. Raising oxygen supply Later in the day, Mr. Thackeray held a meeting with the representatives of medical oxygen production companies, setting a target to produce 3,000 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen every day. “Presently, we produce 1,300 MT oxygen and that has to be increased to 3,000 MT. Similarly, efforts need to be taken to enhance storage capacity. Steps have to be taken to ensure that oxygen is delivered to remote areas in the State as well,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/unlock-without-compromising-safety-cm/article34959519.ece
25 June 2021||CHENNAI,||Mekedatu issue may figure at CWMA meet||The Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA)’s meeting, slated for Friday (June 25), is taking place coincidentally on the day the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal (CWDT) delivered its interim award 30 years ago. The interim award had larger significance than being a mere response to Tamil Nadu’s request for immediate relief then. For the first time in the country, a river water disputes tribunal gave an interim award which was, in turn, facilitated by a verdict of the Supreme Court. But, there prevailed a period of tension for about six months between the two major riparian States of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Since June 1991, Tamil Nadu realised, in 19 out of 30 water years, more than its share of water as stipulated by the tribunal and later, the Supreme Court. On an average, annually, the State received about 260 thousand million cubic feet (tmc ft). Its share was determined as 205 tmc ft in the interim award; 192 tmc ft in the final award (2007) and 177.25 tmc ft by the Supreme Court (2018). Since 2013, the Billigindulu gauging station of the Central Water Commission replaced the Mettur dam as the reference point for measuring water realisation by Tamil Nadu. Of the quantity realised every year, a little less than 150 tmc ft came during June-September (southwest monsoon). However, this was skewed by poor receipts in the first two months of water year (June and July). In all the 30 years, only on seven occasions in June and on eight in July, Tamil Nadu got more than the stipulated quantum of water. This had prompted the State to lodge its protest several times about the efficacy of the implementation mechanism. There was not much change in the situation in the last three years after the constitution of the authority. (Only July 2018 was an exception to this norm). Yet, Tamil Nadu did not complain much as the inflow in the subsequent months – August and September – was bountiful. This year, till June 22, Tamil Nadu recorded about three tmc ft against its due of 6.7 tmc ft. Out of 30 years, the receipts were higher in 18 years in August and in 15 years in September than the prescribed quantum of water. Today’s meeting is expected to discuss issues of immediate concern and discuss the rainfall pattern of the southwest monsoon in the last one month and the outlook for the coming weeks, Tamil Nadu is prepared to give a fitting reply if Karnataka raises the Mekedatu project issue. According to Tamil Nadu, there is no need for a dam in Mekedatu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cwma-to-meet-on-june-25/article34959243.ece
25 June 2021||CHENNAI,||Revoke consent to operate to HUL Kodaikanal factory, say activists||The State Department for Environment and Climate Change should direct the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) to revoke the consent to operate (CTO) given to Hindustan Unilever for non-compliance with the order of the National Green Tribunal and operating Kodaikanal thermometer factory without valid Hazardous Waste Authorisation, say environmental activists. In a letter to V. Meyyanathan, Minister for Environment, Climate Change and Youth Welfare and Sports Development, Nityanand Jayaraman of Chennai Solidarity Group and Navroz Mody, member of Local Area Environment Committee, Kodaikanal, requested the government to commission an extensive site assessment and ecological risk assessment study. In the letter, they said the company was engaged in unauthorised decontamination of mercury-contaminated soil at its factory site. “The operations are... in violation of the order of the NGT. In the interest of a full-and-final cleanup, it is essential to ensure full compliance with the NGT’s orders and to satisfy oneself that the quality of the operations protect the interests of the State. Unsupervised, unauthorised and unscientific intervention will leave Tamil Nadu saddled with a legacy contaminated site like Bhopal,” they said. HUL, however, said soil remediation was being carried out with permission from the NGT and the Supreme Court. All activities were being carried out as per guidelines, applicable standards and permissions issued by the NGT, TNPCB and the CPCB. The activists said HUL had been operating the plant since August 2020 without valid Hazardous Waste Authorisation. Even two years after the [NGT] order, a detailed site assessment and ecological risk assessment — which should not take more than two months — had not yet been done, they said. The company said the study got delayed due to the lockdown. “ The claim that the study could be completed in less than two months is incorrect,” HUL said. “Excavated soil with high mercury concentration has reportedly been stored in the open... If this is the case, mercury is being made available for release into Pambar Shola and Kodaikanal Wildlife Sanctuary,” the activists said, adding the case of Sterlite was being repeated here. HUL said utmost care was being taken to prevent any release of soil outside the factory boundary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/revoke-consent-to-operate-to-hul-kodaikanal-factory-say-activists/article34959484.ece
25 June 2021||GUWAHATI,||In Meghalaya, outrage over felling of heritage pine trees||The felling of several iconic pine trees for widening a road in Meghalaya capital Shillong has triggered outrage, forcing the State government to intervene. Most of these coniferous trees, among the hill town’s USPs, were more than 100 years old. Green activists said the National Highway Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) took advantage of the COVID-19 lockdown to chop the pine trees locals were attached to. But the government swung into action on June 23 after photos and videos of the logs lying beside the road from the town’s Rilbong Bridge to Upper Shillong went viral. This stretch of the road is part of the 71 km Shillong-Dawki four-lane project estimated to cost Rs. 1,251 crore. Dawki is a trade point on the border with Bangladesh. Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma asked the NHIDC to immediately stop felling the trees until the government found a better solution. His instruction coincided with an observation of the National Green Tribunal on a Goa bypass that the construction of a road may be a necessity but should not result in the destruction of biodiversity. The Meghalaya Forest Department said it had received orders to cut down 4,447 trees for the road widening project after it was cleared by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The State’s Forest Minister, James Sangma, said the trees on one side of the road were felled as it was “totally unavoidable”. He also said the right of way for the project had been reduced from the standard 45-60 metres to 24 metres in order to minimise the damage. Forest officials said 10 trees would be planted for each tree felled. But locals said this would hardly make a difference as the site chosen for compensatory afforestation is in another district. “We would like to know if the government followed the Indian Forest Act, Biodiversity Act and the Meghalaya Forest Regulation Act before the trees were hewn.

Hearing a PIL over the woman’s death, a Bench of Justices M.S. Ramachandra Rao and T. Vinod Kumar instructed the Judicial First Class Magistrate of Aler to inquire into Mariamma’s ‘custodial death’.

A Bench of Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari refused to entertain a plea for a “uniform scheme” of assessment to be made applicable across Boards in the country. The court said each Board, whether the CBSE, ICSE or State Boards, was “autonomous and independent”. They could formulate their own schemes after consultation with experts. However, the Bench clarified that allowing Boards to form their own independent schemes did not preclude the court from judicially reviewing their correctness and validity when an occasion arose. By directing the State Boards to declare their results before July 31, the court ensured that students across the country get a level playing field in college admissions and other opportunities for higher studies. Earlier, the CBSE and the ICSE had agreed in the Supreme Court to announce the internal assessment results of their Class 12 students by July 31.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/notify-class-12-assessment-plan-state-boards-told/article34959134.ece

She tried to escape into a small lane, but the duo attacked her again and fled from the scene when she collapsed,” said a senior police official.

Ms. Banerjee virtually participated in the hearing. Senior advocate A.M. Singhvi, who appeared for the Chief Minister, sought recusal of Justice Kausik Chanda on grounds of his association with the BJP as a lawyer.

Justice Chanda asked why the recusal petition had not been presented on June 18, when the matter was brought before him for hearing.

25 June 2021||CHENNAI,||Don’t paint entire police force as barbaric because of one aberration: Madras HC||The Madras High Court on Thursday empathised with the family of a farmer who was beaten to death by a special sub-inspector of police in Salem on Tuesday. It, however, said the incident could not be used to paint the entire police force as brutal and barbaric. When the second Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and T.V. Thamilselvi commenced their proceedings for the day, advocate R. Krishnamoorthy sought permission to make a mention and cited the death of the farmer after the latter quarrelled with the police under the influence of alcohol. When the senior judge in the Bench pointed out that the government appeared to have paid solatium to the family, the advocate, facing suo motu contempt of court proceedings for accusing Justice M. Dhandapani of being biased in favour of the police in another case booked against a woman lawyer, said the police “atrocities” were increasing day by day. Not in agreement with him, Justice Kirubakaran said: “Don't say that. The police are only discharging their duty by questioning people who violate [COVID-19] lockdown restrictions. But people consider themselves to be powerful than the police and the government and enter into wordy duel with the men in uniform. Most of them don't obey law.” Referring to recent videos in circulation in the social media of lawyers threatening to strip policemen of their uniform on being questioned for violating lockdown restrictions, the judge said: “It is unfortunate that you behave like this.” Pointing out that the nomenclature lawyer itself contained the word law, the judge said: “You should be the first to obey law scrupulously. You should be a role model to others,” the judge added. At the same time agreeing that the death of the farmer was certainly an unfortunate incident and such aberration should be avoided by the police, the judge said the issue would be looked into if the advocate files an appropriate petition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/dont-paint-entire-police-force-as-barbaric-because-of-one-aberration-madras-hc/article34959242.ece

25 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Monsoon to be weak till July||The monsoon rainfall,40% above normal from June 1 to 18, has reduced to a trickle over the previous week. The latest update from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) computes the monthly rainfall until June 24 to be just 26% of the normal and there is unlikely to be a significant boost until the first week of July. As of Thursday, India had received 152 mm of rainfall as against the normal 121.2 mm. On Tuesday, the IMD said India is in the grip of a “weak monsoon spell.” The southwest monsoon has so far covered most parts of the country except parts of the northwest — Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab. Unusually, for this period, the monsoon has progressed to eastern, central and adjoining northwest India earlier than normal by seven to 10 days. However, further progress over the remaining parts of country is unlikely for the last week of June, the IMD noted. All the broad subdivisions have posted above normal rainfall so far. East and northeast India has posted 8% extra, northwest India 58%, central India 46% and the southern Peninsula 15%, according to data as of June 23. Rainfall activity is likely to increase over most parts of the country after the first week of July especially in peninsular and central India, which is also part of India’s core agricultural zone dependent on the monsoon for irrigation. “Fairly widespread to widespread rainfall with isolated heavy falls is also likely over most parts of northeast and adjoining east India during most days of the week [July 1-7],” the agency said based on weather models that assess the development of the monsoon system over the fortnight. The India Meteorological Department (IMD), on June 1, said it expects more rain in the monsoon months from June to September than its previous estimate in April. The monsoon rainfall was likely to be 101% of the Long Period Average (LPA) of 88 cm. On April 16, it said the monsoon rainfall would be 98% of the LPA. In the agency's parlance, this still constitutes ‘normal’ rainfall which is anywhere from 96-104% of the LPA.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/monsoon-to-be-weak-till-july/article34959062.ece
25 June 2021||New Delhi,||Cong. raises 5 demands on J&K||Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, who led the party’s delegation at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting on J&K on Thursday, said the party had placed five demands, including restoration of full Statehood, holding early elections, and the return of Kashmiri Pandits, but did not demand the restoration of Article 370. Mr. Azad told mediapersons after the meeting that in the new Bill for Statehood, the government should protect land rights through new domicile rules and guarantee employment for locals. The other demand by the Congress delegation, which included J&K Pradesh Congress Committee chief Ghulam Ahmad Mir and former Deputy Chief Minister Tara Chand, was the release of political detainees at the earliest. “In today’s meeting, from Congress’s side, we informed the Prime Minister why the State should not have been dissolved. The move was done without consulting elected representatives. But in the end, after saying all this, we have put up five big demands in front of the government. Statehood should be restored at the earliest was our first demand,” Mr. Azad said. “The Home Minister as well as the Prime Minister had assured on the floor of Parliament that Statehood would be restored [to J&K] at some point. There is peace now, ceasefire is also there and the borders are also quiet. There can’t be a better time to grant Statehood,” he added. “We had historic domicile rules and also rules regarding employment. The government should give a guarantee that they will bring Bills on land and employment [for J&K],” Mr. Azad said. Though the Congress did not directly refer to the restoration of the special provisions under Article 370, party leaders claimed that its demand for special land rights and job guarantees for locals would “have the same effect”. Specifically asked about the party’s position on Article 370, Mr. Azad said the matter was sub-judice. “For now, we will not talk about this. The people of J&K are in distress since the August 5, 2019 decision ...” Mr. Mir added. Recently, former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram talked about status quo ante by repealing the “offending laws” in the forthcoming monsoon session of Parliament.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-raises-5-demands-on-jk/article34959086.ece

The seven-day rolling average of daily vaccinations in the country continues to increase. It stood at 51.6 lakh on June 23, which is more than the 32.6 lakh recorded a week ago (June 16). It was also significantly higher than the average daily doses recorded a month before (May 23) which was 18.8 lakh. About 26.8% of adults in India, 46% of those aged above 45, and 48.8% of people aged above 60, have got at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. However, only 3.9% are fully vaccinated. The figures are based on the estimated population in 2021. India recorded 47,755 new COVID-19 cases until 9.15 p.m. on Thursday, taking the cumulative caseload to 3,01,29,934.

25 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Army issues tender for 1,750 FICVs||The Army has issued a tender, or a Request For Information (RFI), for the procurement of 1,750 Futuristic Infantry Combat Vehicles (FICVs) to replace the Russian-origin infantry vehicles in service. Early this month, an RFI was also issued for the procurement of 1,770 Future Ready Combat Vehicles (FRCV) for the procurement of the next generation Main Battle Tank, with a planned induction from 2030. “The Ministry of Defence intends to procure an approximate 1,750 quantities of Futuristic Infantry Combat Vehicles (Tracked) in three versions,” the RFI published on Thursday said. Approximately, 55% of them should be gun version, 20% command version and 25% command and surveillance version. Within a week Vendors have been asked to express willingness within a week. “A three-stage induction model has been proposed by the Army and Indian vendors can collaborate with Foreign Original Equipment Manufacturers [OEMs] to supply FICVs within two years of the contract at the rate of 75-100 vehicles per year,” an officer said. This is the Army’s third attempt for the procurement of a new infantry vehicle. According to the RFI, the FICVs would be employed for cross-country operations, including amphibious operations in plain and desert terrain along the Western borders and high altitudes, up to 5,000 m, and mountain terrain along the northern borders in eastern Ladakh, the central sector and north Sikkim. They would replace the 1980s vintage Russian-origin BMP-2,  the officer said. Based on the responses to the RFI, the Army would finalise the specifications and also decide the procurement category. The main operational tasks that would have to performed by the FICV include destroying enemy tanks, armoured personnel carriers, combat vehicles, low-flying helicopters and other ground-based weapon platforms and positions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/army-issues-tender-for-1750-ficvs/article34959072.ece
25 June 2021||Ghaziabad,||RLD chief urges PM to end impasse on farm laws||In a fervent appeal to the Prime Minister to end the deadlock on the farm laws, Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) president Jayant Chaudhary said on Thursday that “policy measures can be termed as reforms only if they satisfy the larger social good”.  “It pains the nation that even after your statement, the government appears to have further withdrawn from engaging with the farmer organisations even as the farmers are waiting at Delhi’s borders,” Mr. Chaudhary said in a letter to the Prime Minister, written on the eve of the completion of six months of farmers’ protests against the farm laws. Referring to the Agriculture Minister’s statements suggesting that a rollback of laws was not possible, Mr. Chaudhary said he could understand that there was a fear in government circles that backtracking on these laws could become a precedent. “However, in the face of public sentiment, a sensitive government would not shy away from taking a step back in order to move forward.”  “It is not clear to the farmers how these laws improve their market position or pricing power,” he said.  He contended that the farmers’ agitation had a negative economic impact, but the failure to resolve the key issues had also hurt the pride of the nation’s agriculturists.  Meanwhile, Bharatiya Kisan Union spokesperson Rakesh Tikait said on Thursday that “the farmers would find their remedy in Parliament and the government would be treated in villages”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rld-chief-urges-pm-to-end-impasse-on-farm-laws/article34959075.ece
25 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||In contact with stakeholders on Afghanistan, says India||India on Thursday said it was in contact with “various stakeholders” in and around Afghanistan, confirming that South Block has adopted a broad-based approach to discuss the future of Afghanistan and the region around with various parties involved. The response came after National Security Adviser Ajit Doval addressed a meeting of his counterparts of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) held on Thursday in Dushanbe. “India supports all peace initiatives and has a long-term commitment towards development and reconstruction of Afghanistan. In this context, we remain in touch with various stakeholders, including regional countries,” said Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi. The comment has added more substance to the reports that India has held a round of secret talks with the members of the Taliban in Doha. Arguing in favour of stronger ties with Kabul, Mr. Bagchi said India has brought development to Afghanistan which was ravaged by violence inflicted by cross-border actors. “India has brought electricity, dams, schools, health clinics, roads and community projects to Afghanistan. The world knows what Pakistan has brought to Afghanistan.” The comments on dialogue with relevant stakeholders has also added to the officially unconfirmed reports of backchannel talks that India has been conducting with Pakistan through third parties. Mr. Doval attended the SCO NSAs meeting, which also saw the participation of his Pakistani counterpart Moeed Yusuf, who has been in the news over reports of backchannel talks. Sources said Mr. Doval argued for the “need to preserve gains made in the last two decades in Afghanistan and give top priority to the welfare of its people”. He also proposed an action plan against Pakistan-based terror outfits Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) as part of the anti-terror framework of the SCO and sought adoption of international standards to counter terror financing, including an MoU between the SCO and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Cross-border attacks against India by LeT and JeM have been at the centre of recent tensions with Pakistan. The issue was being discussed at the FATF on Thursday and a decision on greylisting of Pakistan is expected as early as Friday. Mr. Doval also called for monitoring of new technologies used by terrorists, such as drones, dark web, Artificial Intelligence, blockchain and social media.

25 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Full licence for Covaxin may take time||Bharat Biotech, the manufacturer of Covaxin, may not be given full licensure for its COVID vaccine just yet, said a senior health official, saying the vaccine will continue to be used under emergency authorisation. While the company refused to comment on the latest development, Union Health Ministry officials said the authorities have sought more data from follow up studies. The company earlier this week had submitted data from Phase 3 trials to the subject expert committee (SEC) of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO). The yet-to-be published data submitted showed that Covaxin had demonstrated a 77.8% efficacy in its Phase 3 trial, which was conducted on 25,800 subjects. “The proposal seeking full licensure for Covaxin, was looked into and we have sought more details. Till then Covaxin will continue to be available to public under the earlier emergency authorisation,” an official said. Meanwhile, the Health Ministry on Thursday denied allegations of non-transparent allocation of COVID-19 vaccines to States. Allocation of doses The Central government continues to allocate COVID-19 vaccines to States and Union Territories in a transparent manner, it said, adding that distribution of vaccines is based on population of a State, caseload or disease burden and the State’s utilisation efficiency. The Ministry noted that allocation is negatively affected by vaccine wastage. “India’s national COVID vaccination programme is built on scientific and epidemiological evidence, WHO guidelines and global best practices. Anchored in systematic end-to-end planning, it is implemented through effective and efficient participation of States and Union Territories and the people at large,” said the Ministry. It noted that information about the vaccine supply by Central Government, consumption by the States and Union Territories, unutilised vaccine doses available with them, along with vaccine-supply in the pipeline, is regularly shared in the public domain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/full-licence-for-covaxin-may-take-time/article34959088.ece
25 June 2021||Kolkata,||Calcutta HC reserves order on Mamata’s recusal petition||The Calcutta High Court on Thursday reserved its order on a recusal application filed by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee urging that the election petition filed in the Nandigram results be assigned to another Bench. Ms. Banerjee virtually participated in the hearing. Senior advocate A.M. Singhvi, who appeared for the Chief Minister, sought recusal of Justice Kausik Chanda on grounds of his association with the BJP as a lawyer. Reading from the recusal application, Dr. Singhvi said posts on various social media platforms suggested that Justice Chanda had a “close, pecuniary, personal, professional and ideological relationship with the BJP” and “close relationship with prominent leaders such as Dilip Ghosh and Tathagata Roy”. Justice Chanda asked why the recusal petition had not been presented on June 18, when the matter was brought before him for hearing. During the hearing, there had been cordial discussions between the parties, and Justice Chanda observed that when he had first appeared for the BJP as a lawyer, he had not known the full name of the party. Dr. Singhvi remarked that since then, the BJP has made large strides in West Bengal. He added that the judge would only be elevating his stature by recusing himself from hearing the petition. Dr. Singhvi pointed out that two judges of the Supreme Court had recused themselves from hearing matters related to West Bengal. Justice Chanda said while Dr. Singhvi was associated with the Congress, other counsel having links to the BJP were appearing for the Trinamool in the case. He also asked if he would not be giving in to a media trial if he recused himself. He added that he would think it over and reserved the judgment. Earlier this month, Ms. Banerjee had filed a petition alleging irregularities in the counting exercise of the Nandigram Assembly results.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/calcutta-hc-reserves-order-on-mamatas-recusal-petition/article34959079.ece
25 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Monuments see poor footfall in the first week of reopening||Some of the major Centrally protected monuments that reopened on June 16 after a closure due to the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic saw only about 1% to 7% of their average pre-pandemic daily footfall in the first eight days of the reopening, according to Archaeological Survey of India data. The Union Culture Ministry on June 14 ordered that all monuments under the ASI be opened to the public from June 16, subject to local administration rules, including State-wise weekend lockdown orders. The monuments, sites and museums of the ASI had been closed since April 15. From June 16 to Wednesday, Taj Mahal in Agra was open for five days due to the weekend lockdown in Uttar Pradesh. The daily footfall ranged from 2,128 on June 16 to 4,322 on Monday, according to ASI data accessed by The Hindu . In February 2020, before the pandemic, the UNESCO World Heritage Site used to receive 16,000 to 17,000 visitors on an average, with the numbers increasing on weekends and holidays, said an ASI official. Cap on tickets While tickets are sold only online to maintain crowd control and social distancing, the number of visitors at Taj Mahal was not limited, according to the official. In Delhi, however, tickets at each monument were capped between 7,000 and 10,000 a day. In Delhi, popular tourist destinations such as Humayun’s Tomb, Qutub Minar and Red Fort saw a few hundred visitors a day on an average, down from the thousands of visitors seen earlier. On average, Humayun’s Tomb had 631 daily visitors from June 16 to Wednesday, with June 20, a Sunday, seeing a spike with 1,770 visitors. The official said Humayun’s Tomb used to receive 7,000 to 8,000 visitors a day on average before the pandemic. Similarly, Qutub Minar had an average of 743 daily visitors, ranging from 432 on June 16 to 1,677 on June 20, which was around 7% of the 9,000 to 10,000 visitors on an average pre-COVID-19. Red Fort, which remains closed on Mondays, had an average of 152 daily visitors over seven days, around 1%-2% of its 7,000 to 9,000 daily visitors prior to the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/monuments-see-poor-footfall-in-the-first-week-of-reopening/article34959094.ece
25 June 2021||GUWAHATI,||Jab status linked to resuming of businesses in northeast||The COVID-19 vaccination status has been linked to the opening of shops and business establishments, operation of commercial passenger vehicles as well as the salaries of some government employees in the northeastern region. Besides, these are incentives such as free rice and cash offered by some local authorities to counter the reluctance or resistance to inoculation by people, many of whom believe that the vaccine induces infertility and genetic changes. On June 23, the High Court of Meghalaya directed all shops, commercial establishments, taxi, auto-rickshaw and bus operators to display the vaccination status of their staff. This followed the hearing of a petition challenging the orders of the State’s Deputy Commissioners asking shopkeepers, vendors, local cabbies and others to get vaccinated before they resume their business. The Bench of Chief Justice Biswanath Somadder and Justice H.S. Thangkhiew observed that the orders of the district heads should be seen as a “persuasive advisory” and not coercion. The court, however, pointed out that forced vaccination violates the fundamental rights of the people concerned while advising all shops, commercial centres and public commercial vehicles should prominently display the words “vaccinated” or “not vaccinated” to let their customers or passengers know about their status. “In the event, any shops/establishments/local taxis /auto-rickshaws/maxi cabs and buses flout the above directions, the authority concerned of the State shall immediately direct its closure/stoppage of plying,” the court ordered. The court, fixing June 30 as the next date of hearing, also said the authorities should immediately step in and proceed in accordance with the law if there was any attempt made by any person or organisation to spread misinformation regarding the efficacy of vaccines among the people of the State. The Assam government has directed all the departmental heads to ascertain the vaccination status of their frontline employees before releasing their monthly salaries. Chief Secretary Jishnu Barua, also the chairperson of the State Disaster Management Authority, Assam (ASDMA), issued the order after officials found out that many frontline government employees had not taken their COVID-19 vaccine shots. “Non-vaccination of such frontline government servants may give rise to the possibility of further spread of the virus, which in turn may endanger the lives of common citizens, especially the vulnerable groups like children, pregnant women, etc.,” the order said. “Direct all department heads to ascertain the vaccination status of such government servants before releasing the monthly salary/remuneration from the current month (June) onwards,” it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jab-status-linked-to-resuming-of-businesses-in-northeast/article34959097.ece
25 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Congress to combat vaccine hesitancy||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Thursday asked party colleagues to play an active role in ensuring vaccination coverage of 75% of India’s population by the year end and also address the issue of hesitancy with regard to COVID-19 vaccines. Following a virtual meeting of the general secretaries and All India Congress Committee (AICC) members in charge of various States with Ms. Gandhi, the party has decided to step up its COVID-19 outreach programme by visiting over 3 crore households across 736 districts in a span of 30 days. From July 1 to 17, the Congress will also hold protests against rising prices of petrol and diesel as well as food items by taking out protest marches, cycle yatras and signature campaign at petorl pumps, general secretary (organisation) K.C. Venugopal said. Addressing the AICC office-bearers, Ms. Gandhi said experts had pointed to the possibility of a third wave in a few months and the vulnerability of the children in such a scenario. “The second wave these past four months has been devastating for lakhs and lakhs of families all over the country. We must learn from this traumatic experience so that we do not have to experience it yet again,” Ms. Gandhi said. The Congress chief urged party leaders to disseminate the party’s white paper (released on June 22) that not only details the “failure” of the Narendra Modi government in handling the pandemic but also offers suggestions in aggressively vaccinating the majority of the adult population in the shortest possible time. Ms. Gandhi also talked about the ‘intolerable’ burden placed on the people because of the rising fuel prices and the skyrocketing prices of essential commodities like pulses and edible oils.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-to-combat-vaccine-hesitancy/article34959099.ece
25 June 2021||kollam,||Kerala women’s panel chief’s ‘you suffer’ remark draws flak||Kerala Women’s Commission chairperson M.C. Josephine has courted controversy for asking a domestic violence victim to “suffer” as she has not filed a police complaint. The video clip of a seemingly annoyed Ms. Josephine snapping at a victim created much resentment, with many demanding her resignation. Her rude remark to a distressed woman, who seemed a little hesitant to open up, also generated a volley of trolls on social media. When the woman said she was being abused by her husband and her mother-in-law, the chairperson asked if she had approached the police. The Ernakulam resident revealed she had not shared it with anyone and Ms. Josephine retorted with a curt “then you suffer”. Many prominent persons, including politicians, pointed out her behaviour as arrogant and demanded a more humane person as her replacement. Ms. Josephine, in her statement, said that her hard tone was due to the issues in audio quality and she had only taken a mother’s freedom with the woman. “It was my self-indignation over girls failing to come forward bravely with complaints, but on second thoughts I felt I could have avoided that comment. If my words have hurt her, I express regret,” she said. She further explained that she was totally clueless about the format of the programme. “I had tried to avoid that programme due to my busy schedule and health issues. I decided to go when they told me my response was necessary and the subject was dowry-related. Only after reaching there, I came to know that it was a call-in programme,” Ms. Josephine said. Cong. seeks her removal In Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president K. Sudhakaran slammed Ms. Josephine for slighting a victim of domestic violence. He said the woman had called Ms. Josephine as a last resort. However, the chairperson had slighted her. Mr. Sudhakaran demanded that Ms. Josephine resign. He said the government’s women helpline would offer no solace to victims, if Ms. Josephine’s public reaction were any indication. He said women were generally reluctant to stand in front of police stations for long hours to register their complaints.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-womens-panel-chiefs-you-suffer-remark-draws-flak/article34959451.ece
25 June 2021||GUWAHATI,||Outrage over felling of heritage pine trees for road in Meghalaya||The felling of several iconic pine trees for widening a road in Meghalaya capital Shillong has triggered outrage, forcing the State government to intervene. Most of these coniferous trees, among the hill town’s USPs, were more than 100 years old. Green activists said the National Highway Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) took advantage of the COVID-19 lockdown to chop the pine trees locals were attached to. But the government swung into action on June 23 after photos and videos of the logs lying beside the road from the town’s Rilbong Bridge to Upper Shillong went viral. This stretch of the road is part of the 71 km Shillong-Dawki four-lane project estimated to cost Rs. 1,251 crore. Dawki is a trade point on the border with Bangladesh. Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma asked the NHIDC to immediately stop felling the trees until the government finds a better solution. His instruction coincided with an observation of the National Green Tribunal on a Goa bypass that construction of a road may be a necessity but should not result in the destruction of biodiversity. Cleared by Centre A Meghalaya Forest Department official said it had received orders to cut down 4,447 trees for the road widening project after it was cleared by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The State’s Forest Minister, James Sangma said the trees on one side of the road were felled as it was “totally unavoidable”. He also said the right of way for the project had been reduced from the standard 45-60 metres to 24 metres in order to minimise the damage. Forest officials said 10 trees would be planted in lieu of each tree felled. But locals said this would hardly make a difference as the site chosen for compensatory afforestation is in another district. “We would like to know if the government followed Indian Forest Act, Biodiversity Act and Meghalaya Forest Regulation Act before the trees were hewn. Who gave the land for the project and who is funding for the destruction of the trees?” said activist Agnes Kharshiing, president of Civil Society Women Organisation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/outrage-over-felling-of-heritage-pine-trees-for-road-in-meghalaya/article34959287.ece
25 June 2021||Hyderabad,||315 MVA transformer at Mamidipally gutted||In a major accident that took place in the 400 KV sub-station of TS-Transco at Mamidipally village on the outskirts of the city, near Shamshabad, late on Thursday night, a 315 MVA transformer was gutted along with adjoining transmission system equipment. The engineers of the Transco stationed at the sub-station noticed the fire immediately after it was seen on the transformer around 10 p.m. and alerted the nearby fire stations and switched it off to prevent further damage and diverted the load to other transformers in the sub-stations. The fire tenders rushed there and put off the fire before it could spread to other equipment and transformers of the sub-station. Chairman of TS-Transco D. Prabhakar Rao rushed to the spot immediately after learning about the incident along with other higher officials and engineers of the power utility. When contacted, Mr. Rao said the immediate reason for the fire assessed to be internal problem developed within the 25-year-old transformer. He stated that there would not be any impact on power supply to the City and other area linked to the sub-station as three other transformers were there to take the load. At the time of the incident, the damaged transformer was bearing about 30% of the load and immediately on noticing the fire, the control room switched the load to other sub-stations in the transmission system. Officials of the Transco stated that the loss due to fire could be about Rs. 2 crore as per the preliminary assessment and it was not known whether the damaged transformer could be repaired for use again or had to be replaced. The authorities thanked the fire services department for rushing fire tenders immediately to limit the damage due to fire mishap.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/315-mva-transformer-at-mamidipally-gutted/article34959356.ece

25 June 2021||NEW DELHi,||NCB arrests key accused in Pak.-based drug ring||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Thursday arrested an alleged key member of a Pakistan-based drug trafficking syndicate in connection with the recent seizure of over 56.5 kg of heroin by the Border Security Force (BSF). The accused has been identified as Jasbir Singh, a resident of Hoshiyarpur in Punjab. Seized in Rajasthan The BSF had seized the contraband on June 3 at Bandali Khajuvala in Rajasthan, along the Indo-Pakistan border. The next day, the force arrested two accused persons, Rupa and Harmesh Singh, in Punjab, with the help of the local police. However, prime accused Jasbir Singh and his associate, Kali, fled the spot. “Both of them are habitual offenders under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, Indian Penal Code (murder), Excise Act, Arms Act and the Jail Manual Act,” said an NCB official. They had been absconding since 2019, the official added. Suspected supplier The case was handed over to the NCB’s Jodhpur unit. The agency identified one Malik Choudhary, a resident of Lahore in Pakistan, as the suspected heroin supplier and launched a hunt for Jasbir Singh. During the course of the investigation, three more accused — Rajvinder Singh, Sukhpreet Singh and Sunil Singh, all residents of Rajasthan — were arrested for harbouring Jasbir Singh and conducting recces along the border to facilitate heroin smuggling. Based on the findings, the NCB sleuths mounted surveillance and finally arrested the prime accused in Hoshiyarpur on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ncb-arrests-key-accused-in-pak-based-drug-ring/article34959058.ece
25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||PM backs delimitation exercise in J&K||He added that “delimitation has to happen at a quick pace so that polls can happen and J&K gets an elected government that gives strength to its development trajectory.” “The biggest strength of our democracy is the ability to sit across a table and exchange views,” he said. Government sources said Prime Minister Modi thanked all the participating leaders for making it to Delhi for the meeting and asked that they “express their views frankly.” National Conference leader Omar Abdullah, in a presser after the meeting said, “We told the Prime Minister that we don’t stand with what was done on August 5, 2019. We are not ready to accept it. But we won’t take law into our hands. We’ll fight this in court. We also told the Prime Minister that there’s been a breach of trust between the state and Centre. It is the Centre’s duty to restore it.” Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said “almost 80% of parties spoke on Article 370 but the matter is sub judice.” Both Mr. Azad and Mr. Abdullah stressed on restoration of statehood and reversal of many executive and legal changes related to land rights protection and restoration of a Jammu and Kashmir cadre in bureaucracy. Ms. Mufti’s take was somewhat different, when she spoke after the meeting. “The people of Jammu and Kashmir are in a lot of difficulties after August 5, 2019. They are angry, upset and emotionally shattered. They feel humiliated. I told the Prime Minister that the people of J&K don’t accept the manner in which Article 370 was abrogated unconstitutionally, illegally and immorally,” she said. BJP leader Kavinder Gupta said that any thought of restoring Article 370 should not even be considered. “Elections will be held after the delimitation process, and an Assembly constituted once again. The process will come into effect about which people are hoping that they’ll get representation. Article 370 has been abrogated. It should not even be thought that it will ever come back,” he said. Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who was present at the meeting, said the “delimitation exercise and peaceful elections are important milestones in restoring statehood as promised in Parliament”, making it clear that Assembly polls had to be a precursor to any talk of restoring statehood. Some political parties however did stress that statehood should be restored before polls can be held. Minister of State for the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), Dr. Jitendra Singh, in an official statement after the meeting, said the next step in strengthening democracy in J&K would be swiftly completing the delimitation process so that the Assembly polls could be held, and that the Prime Minister stressed the need for “constructive engagement” of all political parties with the delimitation process. Among those who attended the meeting were four former Chief Ministers of Jammu and Kashmir — Farooq and Omar Abdullah of the National Conference, Ghulam Nabi Azad of the Congress, and Mehbooba Mufti of the PDP. People’s Conference leaders Muzzaffar Baig and Sajjad Lone also attended as did Kavinder Gupta and Ravinder Raina of the BJP and Bheem Singh of the Panthers Party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-backs-delimitation-exercise-in-jk/article34959065.ece
25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Hope this is the beginning of a process, says Omar||NC president and Gupkar alliance chief Dr. Abdullah said building the trust is very necessary and restoration of full statehood will be the first trust building exercise from New Delhi. All the constituents of the Gupkar Alliance, including Dr. Abdullah and Peoples Democratic Party’s Mehbooba Mufti reiterated their demand to restore the special status of J&K, as it existed on August 4, 2019. Ms. Mufti said she complimented the PM for initiating dialogue with China and Pakistan and insisted that India should talk to Pakistan for peace in Kashmir. “We also sought security on land, jobs and minerals of J&K and an end to any kind of intimidation. We also demanded the release of political leaders,” she added. Kashmir-based Peoples Conference (PC) and J&K Apni Party also sought special provisions on the issue of land and jobs during the meeting, while describing the meeting as “cordial and dignified”. However, these two parties did not discuss Article 370, saying “it's sub judice”. “I did suggest to the PM to incorporate 35(A) (special provision to secure jobs and land for locals) under Article 371. There was a thrust on getting together in strengthening democracy in J&K and the majority of leaders demanded restoration of statehood. The PM did suggest elections after the delimitation process is completed and also promised on the restoration of statehood. After that other issues will be taken up,” PC's Muzaffar Hussain Baigh said.

During the hearing, Justice Khanwilkar orally remarked that the University Grants Commission should announce a cut-off date for admissions to prompt school Boards to declare Class 12 results on time. “There should not be any cause for uncertainty,” Justice Maheshwari noted. Most States have cancelled their Class 12 exams due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Assam informed the court on Thursday that it had cancelled its Class 12 exams and the assessment scheme was under formulation. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) also submitted that it had cancelled the exams for its students. The court has been, in every hearing, advising caution to States, saying children should not be exposed to the risk of contracting the infection. “We know how the second wave started and how quickly it panned out… Everything changed in a matter of 10 days… Now we don’t know how the third wave will unfold,” Justice Khanwilkar remarked on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/notify-class-12-internal-assessment-scheme/article34959070.ece

Mr. Roy had joined the Trinamool Congress earlier this month after being associated with the BJP for over three years. The development comes at a time when the BJP has written to the Assembly Speaker seeking Mr. Roy’s disqualification as an MLA. Mr. Roy contested and won the recently concluded Assembly election from the Krishnanagar Uttar Assembly constituency. “The Speaker’s decision is final in such matters. If anyone has an issue, there can be voting in the Assembly,” the Chief Minister said. The decision to appoint Mr. Roy the PAC Chairperson will not only help accommodate the veteran politician in a key post but also prevent a BJP legislator from occupying the post. Usually, the post is reserved for a member of the Opposition parties. On Wednesday, Mr. Roy filed his nomination for the post. The BJP leadership said the development proved that the Trinamool Congress did not follow Constitutional norms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/trinamool-to-back-roy-for-pac-chairperson-post/article34959081.ece
25 June 2021||PUNE,||Rahul’s Twitter attacks not enough: Saamana||The Shiv Sena, in an editorial on Thursday in its mouthpiece, Saamana, said former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Centre only on Twitter, and failed to produce a viable Opposition. “Mr. Gandhi attacks the Centre and its policies regularly, but that is on Twitter,” it said and exhorted Mr. Gandhi to join hands with Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar to get all Opposition parties on board against the ruling BJP. The Sena, which is in alliance with the Congress and the NCP in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, chided the Congress for failing to lead the United Progressive Alliance effectively and not having a proper national president even now. The editorial said, “He [Mr. Modi] knows the situation in the country has gone out of his hands and his body language has changed... But even so, and despite the ire of the general public, the confidence of the BJP and the Central government remains undiminished as they know that they face no threat owing to a weak and disunited Opposition.” The Sena’s less-than-charitable remarks towards its allies are particularly significant in the light of the heightened tensions between the three MVA partners. The Congress’s recent pronouncements of fighting polls alone and the Sena’s alleged frustration at being dominated by the NCP have led to speculation that the saffron party will once again gravitate towards the BJP. Elaborating on the nature of the Opposition, the editorial took a wry dig at Mr. Pawar. “The tea party called the ‘Rashtra Manch’ at Sharad Pawar’s Delhi home showed the true status of the Opposition. The two-and-a-half-hour meeting yielded nothing, despite being hyped by the media.” Earlier this week, Mr. Pawar hosted a meeting of the leaders of eight Opposition parties, including the Trinamool Congress, the Samajwadi Party, the Aam Aadmi Party, the Rashtriya Lok Dal, and the Left parties at his residence in Delhi, amid heightened speculation about the possibility of a ‘third front’ against the BJP. The unlikely coalition of the Sena, the NCP and the Congress came into being in November 2019 following the Sena’s acrimonious split with its partner of three decades, the BJP, owing to a bitter wrangling over the Chief Minister’s post.  The confidence of the Centre remains undiminished as they know that they face no threat owing to a weak and disunited Opposition Saamana editorial||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rahuls-twitter-attacks-not-enough-saamana/article34959083.ece
25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Blissful atma swaroopa||In the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Yagnyavalkya explains to Maitreyi that the self or the atma alone is very dear to each one of us, though we may think we love and care for our kith and kin, etc, and our possessions. This is because the atma swaroopa is essentially blissful and each one longs to attain this bliss. In the grantha Satasloki, Adi Sankara alludes to the human tendency to get attached to people, objects, places, etc, and shows that this attachment is the real cause of sorrow, pointed out Sri K. Ramasubramaniam in a discourse. The acharya explains with examples to show that the self is dearer than anything else to each one of us. All objects are valued because we think they give us happiness though in reality no object can give sorrow or happiness always. Thus we shift between likes and dislikes throughout our existence. If some objects cause sorrow, they are discarded. Though one may say one’s wife, son or others are dear to him, they are not really the object of his desire. For, he will not hesitate to assert his rights and views in case differences of opinion may arise. Suppose the son refuses to act according to the wishes of his father or the wife chooses to make independent decisions that are not to one’s liking, then the choice would be to reject them in preference to his own wishes. If suppose a man’s hand is badly infected and the doctor advises amputation, the person surely will agree rather than endanger his life. He would not mind losing his hand though it had served him well until then. The idea is that all these are dear to a person only because he thinks he derives happiness from them. Ultimately it is one’s own self that is the real object of love and not others. Everything is dear only for one’s own sake.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/blissful-atma-swaroopa/article34959089.ece

25 June 2021||Mumbai,||Maharashtra Congress chief called to Delhi||While touring north Maharashtra to take stock of his party’s growth in the region, Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole was abruptly called to Delhi, giving rise to yet another round of speculation on the already shaky political ground of the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance in Maharashtra. However, the Congress said Mr. Patole’s visit to Delhi was for organisational reasons. “It’s likely that we will be electing an Assembly Speaker in the upcoming monsoon session. The leaders in Delhi needed to speak about this. At the same time, several BJP MLAs want to join the Congress. That issue also needs to be discussed,” said Mr. Patole, when asked about his trip to Delhi, due on Friday. He said he would be meeting former Congress president Rahul Gandhi. Mr. Patole dismissed the attempt to link his meeting with causing instability in the MVA alliance. “I am the president of the Maharashtra Congress and will naturally think about making my party stronger. But that does not mean I have problems with the other parties in the Maha Vikas Aghadi. Those who think that this government will fall should stop daydreaming. We will work for five years,” he said. Two days ago, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar held a meeting with the leaders of eight Opposition parties, resulting in speculation about a ‘third front’ against the BJP. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray also slammed the Congress for its stand on contesting the next State polls alone.  Those who think that this government will fall should stop daydreaming.

In Asia, China and India are the most frequently mentioned countries linked to shipment of drugs sold on the 19 major darknet markets analysed over 2011-2020. “Access to drugs has also become simpler than ever with online sales, and major drug markets on the dark web are now worth some $315 million annually. Contactless transactions, such as through the mail, are also on the rise, a trend possibly accelerated by the pandemic,” it said. Although this is a “tiny fraction” of overall drug sales, the trend of using dark web on the rise, with a fourfold increase in annual sales from the beginning of the 2010s to more recent years.

Replying to the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the Governor for his address in the Assembly on Thursday, Mr. Stalin said the Samathuvapuram [egalitarian habitat] project, first implemented by former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, would continue to be implemented. The Chief Minister said old Samathuvapurams would be renovated and new ones set up. Named Samathuvapuram (later renamed Periyar Ninaivu Samathuvapuram ), the erstwhile DMK government (1996-2001) had implemented a project to provide housing to beneficiaries from all communities to reside on the same premises, ensuring social harmony among them. Mr. Stalin announced that 100 temples would be renovated without altering their heritage value, at a cost of Rs. 100 crore, in this fiscal. Tanks and cars in temples would be renovated, and festivals held in these temples as part of implementing the DMK’s promise to allocate Rs. 1,000 crore for temple renovations, he said.

25 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tamil Nadu gradually adding backlog deaths to its virus tally||Tamil Nadu has been gradually adding backlog COVID-19 deaths to its tally since the last week of May after the cases began to fall. At least 337 deaths added daily in the media bulletin since the last week of May had actually occurred at least a month before their reporting date, indicating that these deaths happened during the ascending phase of the second wave. However, it is difficult to ascertain how many such backlog deaths have exactly been reconciled as the media bulletin released daily included deaths reported with varying durations of delay. For instance, of the 287 deaths reported on June 18, 173 had occurred within three days before the reporting date, 44 had occurred between three days and two weeks, 27 had occurred before two to four weeks and 43 had occurred at least four weeks ago. Two of these deaths were, in fact, reported after a delay more than 50 days. If deaths reported with a delay of at least two weeks are considered, then the State had reconciled at least 937 such deaths since the last week of May. The reporting of deaths with delays has particularly increased since the second week of June. From June 1 till June 23, the actual number of deaths occurred were 5,598. In the same period, the State’s media bulletin reported 7,514 deaths, a difference of 1,916. In contrast, during the month of April and May, the reported deaths were lesser than the deaths that occurred. (Please refer to the infographic for more details). The government has a State-level deaths committee in place to periodically audit and reconcile deaths that were missed. A senior official from the Medical and Family Welfare Department said that the delays mainly happened at the level of local bodies (in case of deaths in home quarantine) or the private or occasionally government hospitals. “Once the death reports are received, we do a verification and add it to our daily reporting figures. We want to ensure that all the missed deaths are reported,” he said.  Once the death reports are received we do a verification and add it to our daily reporting figures.

So would the cases filed against those who had protested against the methane project, the neutrino observatory project, the Kudankulam nuclear power plant project and the Chennai-Salem expressway. Replying to some members’ requests to withdraw cases filed over other issues, Mr. Stalin said the cases that had been filed when the AIADMK was in power were being scrutinised and action would soon be taken in respect of the cases filed over other issues. Tamizhaga Vazhvurimai Katchi leader T. Velmurugan (Panruti) requested that cases filed against those who had protested over the Cauvery water issue be withdrawn. Congress whip S. Vijayadharani (Vilavancode) urged the Chief Minister to withdraw cases registered against locals who had protested against the location of State-run liquor shops. Several women were among those who had been booked. CPI(M) member Nagai Mali (Kilvelur) requested Mr. Stalin to look into the cases registered against students who had taken part in the protests against the Sterlite plant in Thoothukudi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cases-filed-over-various-protests-to-be-withdrawn/article34959240.ece
25 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Duraimurugan questions EPS over river linking project||Minister of Water Resources Duraimurugan on Thursday questioned AIADMK leader Edappadi K. Palaniswami’s role as Chief Minister in implementing the Godavari-Gundar scheme, when the latter urged the new DMK government to take steps to implement it. During a debate in the Assembly, Mr. Palaniswami urged the DMK government to implement various water projects for the benefit of the State. Mr. Duraimurugan intervened to say, “We have just come to power and you are forcing us to do this and that. What were you doing for the last 10 years [of AIADMK government] if the projects were important?” The Leader of the House also prompted Mr. Palaniswami to list out the challenges faced by the erstwhile government in implementing the scheme. Acquisition of lands was a major challenge in implementing various schemes, Mr. Palaniswami said, adding that the erstwhile DMK government, between 2006 and 2011, did not acquire lands to implement various water projects. Mr. Duraimurugan said if that was the case, the AIADMK government could have implemented the scheme during its two tenures over a decade. “You could have at least linked rivers within the State. It was during our leader Kalaignar ’s [M. Karunanidhi] tenure that we brought Krishna water to Tamil Nadu,” he said. While Mr. Palaniswami chose not to respond, AIADMK deputy floor leader O. Panneerselvam said the agreement to bring Krishna water to Tamil Nadu was signed when M.G. Ramachandran was Chief Minister. “I am not denying that. But the AIADMK government only signed the agreement. It was only during the DMK government that the channel was laid,” Mr. Duraimurugan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/duraimurugan-questions-eps-over-river-linking-project/article34959226.ece
25 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Failure of DSE to verify claims caused Rs. 23.27 crore loss||The failure of the Directorate of School Education (DSE) and the Directorate of Elementary Education (DEE) in verifying the correctness of claims preferred by the Tamil Nadu Textbook Corporation resulted in avoidable expenditure of Rs. 21.85 crore, according to the report of the Comptroller of Auditor General (GAG) of India. The report also said that the failure of the Director of School Education in detecting errors in textbooks led to avoidable expenditure of Rs. 1.42 crore. The report tabled in the Assembly pointed out that the Tamil Nadu Textbook and Educational Services Corporation (TNTBESC), responsible for printing and distributing textbooks, had been including an additional amount of 5% on the cost of paper as handling charges. But it was not a component of the production cost, as approved by the State government, in an order issued in December 2010. The CAG report said on being pointed out by the audit, the corporation discontinued the levy in the consequent claim (May 2019) in respect of the academic year 2019-20. “But the DSE and the DEE failed to verify the correctness of the claim submitted by TNTBESC. Their failure has resulted in the excess payment of Rs. 21.85 crore during the period from2016-17to2018-19,” the report said. An additional avoidable payment of Rs. 1.42 crore was paid to TNTBESC for printing and supplying 6,36,900 copies of books for two subjects for 11th and 12th standards. According to the DSE, reprinting was necessitated by certain conceptual errors pointed out by the teachers. Errors found “Audit found that the conceptual errors were in the foreword and preface of the textbooks and in one to seven inner pages of these eight books. A total of Rs. 1.42 crore was paid to TNTBESC in March 2016,” the report said. The report added that even though a system was put in place from2017-18for the scrutiny of textbooks before ordering print, the DSE had not checked or reviewed them. The report also recommended the institutionalisation of a fail-safe rigorous checking of textbooks before mass printing.

25 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Govt. will put a full stop to COVID -19’||Due to the steps taken by the DMK government, the spread of COVID-19 has come down and even if the third wave strikes, Tamil Nadu has the strength to face it, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin said in the Assembly on Thursday. With everyone’s cooperation, the government will put a full stop to the pandemic, he said. In his reply to the debate on the Motion of Thanks on the Governor’s Address in the House, Mr. Stalin criticised the erstwhile AIADMK government for not having taken sufficient steps to counter the spread of COVID-19 in the State. Launching a tirade against former Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, Mr. Stalin said it was wrong to say that the AIADMK had controlled COVID-19, and went on to question Mr. Palaniswami’s functions as the Chief Minister, after the model code of conduct came into force on February 26. Referring to Mr. Palaniswami’s statement that since the code was in force, the Chief Minister could not personally oversee the COVID-19 situation, Mr. Stalin asked whether he had not undertaken any activity as Chief Minister since then. “Have you not undertaken any work after February 26? Did anyone tie the former Chief Minister’s [Mr. Palaniswami] hands so that he should not do anything to control COVID-19?” Mr. Stalin asked. He wondered whether the AIADMK had forgotten that it was still in power between February 26 and May 6. “The pandemic is not a political issue. It is not a dispute between parties. And it is not an issue facing the government. It is a people’s problem. The government will put a full stop to COVID-19 with the cooperation of everyone,” he said. Later, when AIADMK leader Edappadi K. Palaniswami spoke, he denied any lethargy on the part of his government and went on to list the steps taken by it. Due to the model code and since the Election Commission of India did not grant permission to oversee the COVID-19 situation, the Chief Secretary was managing governance during the period, he said. ‘Will fulfil promises’ During his concluding remarks, Mr. Stalin said, “We were patient for 10 years, and now we have come to power. We will fulfil the promises we have made. You need not have an iota of doubt over this.” Among those who commented on the Chief Minister’s reply was Leader of the House and Minister for Water Resources Duraimurugan, who compared Mr. Stalin’s leadership qualities with that of former Chief Ministers C.N. Annadurai and M. Karunanidhi. Three Bills that were introduced in the House were passed by voice vote. Later, Speaker M. Appavu adjourned the House sine die .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-will-put-a-full-stop-to-covid-19/article34959236.ece

25 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Rental bike, CCTV camera footage helped crack ATM case||CCTV camera footage of a bike used by a pair of suspects led the police to a breakthrough in the investigation into the SBI ATM thefts in the city. The gang from Haryana struck at 14 places between June 15 and 18. Similar offences were committed in other places across the country as well. Following initial reports, Police Commissioner Shankar Jiwal held an emergency meeting on Tuesday with bank officials and deputed a special team to nab the suspects, who had come from the northern states and committed the offence. During the course of the investigation, the special team arrested one Amir Arsh, of Ballabhgarh, Haryana, with help from the Haryana Police. During interrogation, the accused confessed, explaining the modus operandi of the group and provided other leads. Mr. Jiwal told The Hindu , “Immediately after the cases were reported, we deputed a special team and nabbed a suspect, who flew back from the city. Five or six more persons could have been part of the gang. The groups are interconnected and from different States. With help of other State police, we will try to locate and arrest them.” Explaining the events that led to a breakthrough in the case, a senior police officer said more than five groups had operated within the city limits. They came in pairs on motorbikes and stole the money from the ATMs. CCTV camera footage from one of the ATM kiosks showed a bike passing by at the time of occurrence. The accused were wearing helmets to avoid identification. The police checked the registration number of the bike and traced it to the owner, who was renting them out. He provided them with details of the person who rented the vehicle. From there, the team collected the phone numbers and photographs of the accused, and tracked the signal of a mobile phone used by one of them, who was moving toward the airport. They collected his ticket details and traced him to Delhi. Based on his information, the team gathered details about the other accused, an officer said. Details have been shared with the Haryana police. “We will try to secure the remaining accused soon,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rental-bike-cctv-camera-footage-helped-crack-atm-case/article34959208.ece
25 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Tangedco failed to levy Rs. 827.64 cr. damages’||The Tangedco did not levy liquidated damages of Rs. 827.64 crore on nine long-term suppliers who delayed the commencement of supplies from scheduled delivery dates during the previous AIADMK regime. It also paid enhanced tariff to eight long-term power suppliers, despite them not supplying power for the first two years of the agreement period, leading to an avoidable expenditure of Rs. 712.03 crore till 2018, the CAG report for the year ending March 2018 said. The CAG report, tabled in the Assembly on Thursday, also found that Tangedco did not follow the guidelines laid down by the Centre for phasing out the accumulation of ash on land, and accumulated 62.15 million metric tonnes in ash dykes in three thermal power stations, as on March 2019. “The continued dumping of ash on land resulted in the contamination of groundwater, the Buckingham Canal and the Kosasthalaiyar river,” the report said. On medium-term power purchase agreements, Tangedco did not claim liquidated damages of Rs. 24 crore from two suppliers for a delay in commencement of supply. “Instead, it procured the shortfall quantity at higher rates, resulting in the avoidable expenditure of Rs. 116.04 crore,” it said. The CAG also found that a delay in the completion of projects by central generating stations (CGS) had led to Tangedco bearing cost escalation of Rs. 2,381.54 crore, by way of additional cost in tariff, besides purchasing the shortfall quantity by incurring avoidable expenditure of Rs. 2,099.48 crore. As Tangedco was not drawing the entitled share of power from low-cost CGS and drawing the same quantity from other costlier sources, it incurred an avoidable expenditure of Rs. 349.67 crore. It also became liable for payment of higher tariff for purchasing solar power, resulting in excess expenditure of Rs. 605.48 crore, the report said. The purchase of power from co-generation plants, by terminating the existing agreements and purchasing the same through the short-term route, also resulted in avoidable expenditure of Rs. 93.41 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tangedco-failed-to-levy-rs-82764-cr-damages/article34959238.ece
25 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||UPSC calls for revised list of DGP candidates||Barely three days before the crucial meeting scheduled in New Delhi to finalise the panel of officers for appointment as Director-General of Police/head of police force, the Union Public Service Commission has called for a revised list of eligible officers from the Tamil Nadu Government. Tamil Nadu DGP J.K. Tripathy is retiring on June 30. While the names of seven qualifying DGP rank officers belonging to 1987 to 1989 batches of IPS was initially sent for empanelment, top sources in the police headquarters here said a revised list, including nine ADGP rank officers of the 1990 and 1991 batches, has been sent to the UPSC. The UPSC follows a prescribed format, guidelines of the Supreme Court in the Prakash Singh case and a 360-degree assessment to shortlist three or five names to be sent to the State governments for choosing one as head of the police force. The Supreme Court had fixed a minimum residual service of six months for consideration of appointment to the top post. C. Sylendra Babu belonging to the 1987 batch is the senior most IPS officer in the list followed by Karan Singha of the same batch. The third senior most officer is Sanjay Arora of the 1988 batch who is on central deputation and was on Wednesday posted as Special DGP, Central Reserve Police Force. Others in the batch are Sunil Kumar Singh and P. Kandaswamy. While the 1989 batch has Md. Shakeel Akhter and Braj Kishore Ravi, the fresh list sent to the UPSC comprises Shankar Jiwal, A.K. Viswanathan, Abash Kumar, T.V. Ravichandran (on central deputation), Seema Agrawal in the 1990 batch and Amraesh Pujari, M. Ravi, K. Jayanth Murali and Karuna Sagar of the 1991 batch. All these officers have the qualifying service of 30 years in IPS and are serving in the rank of DGP and ADGPs. Going by the Supreme Court ruling in the Prakash Singh case, an officer posted as DGP/head of police force in a State will hold office for a minimum two years irrespective of the date of superannuation. Though the UPSC cleared five names in 2017 and three names in 2019, the State government can insist on five names, going by provisions under the Tamil Nadu Police Establishment Act, sources said and added that the State Government can pick any one from the list sent by the UPSC to head the police force.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/upsc-calls-for-revised-list-of-dgp-candidates/article34959217.ece
25 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Excess procurement of fans, mixies, grinders resulted in Rs. 124.43 crore loss: CAG||The non-compliance to applicable codal provisions and deviations from financial propriety while implementing a scheme for the distribution of electric fans, mixies and grinders (FMGs) to women has resulted in a loss of Rs. 124.43 crore to the Tamil Nadu government [during the previous AIADMK regime], a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India has stated. The CAG report on the general and social sector for the year ending March 2018 (Report no. 1 of 2020), tabled in the Assembly on Thursday, said excess procurement was to the tune of Rs. 102.45 crore. Besides, the loss due to storage in uninsured godowns was Rs. 13.64 crore, and there was avoidable expenditure on pre-delivery inspection, which stood at Rs. 8.34 crore. The government of Tamil Nadu (GoTN) introduced the scheme in June 2011, and it was to be implemented in five phases. After the distribution of FMGs to all eligible beneficiaries in the fifth and final phase in March 2018, the Revenue Department held a huge stock of FMGs at its storage points. “Faced with surplus stocks, GoTN ordered [April 2017] the distribution of surplus appliances for free to police personnel, schools and anganwadis, among others, in contravention of the scheme’s guidelines,” the report said. “Further, GoTN did not assess the utility of domestic model mixies and grinders at noon meal centres in schools and anganwadis, which did not have grinding needs for items on their menu,” the report added. In reply to an audit query, the Collectors of Tirunelveli, Dharmapuri and Perambalur and the Tahsildar of Dharmapuri said the surplus stocks arose on account of deaths, permanent shifting, migration, bogus cards and the deletion of ineligible beneficiaries. The State government said the number of eligible beneficiaries was originally estimated at 1.85 crore, but it came down to 1.81 crore due to diligent monitoring of the distribution process. “The reply endorses the audit’s finding that the Department should have taken measures to verify the June 2011 data, especially in view of the surplus stocks, arising after distribution every year,” the CAG report added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/excess-procurement-of-fans-mixies-grinders-resulted-in-rs-12443-crore-loss-cag/article34959232.ece

This resulted in the avoidable expenditure of Rs. 1.69 crore to DoET. The distribution of laptops to students was made only after the close of the academic year,” the report said.  The CAG also found that ELCOT had allotted two acres of land required by Ford India to meet its green norms, without following due process. It allotted the land which belonged to Satyam Computer Services for the creation of a green belt by Ford, for which the IT company had already paid Rs. 1.01 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/elcot-faulted-over-laptop-purchase/article34959222.ece

25 June 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Folk artistes seek govt.’s attention to their plight||With their livelihood being hit for two consecutive years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, folk artistes staged a performance at Chinnavedampatti on the outskirts of Coimbatore on Thursday urging the State government to provide cash assistance to all the artistes. The event was held outside a temple in Chinnavedampatti, which saw the performances by nadaswaram and thavil players, besides those of folk arts. According to K. Nanjappan, vice-president of Coimbatore District Association of Stage Play, Folk Arts and Nadaswaram Artistes, the Tamil months of Panguni, Chithirai and Vaikasi (from mid-March to mid-June) is when the artistes get most of the employment opportunities through temple festivals, weddings and other events. “Through our earnings in these three months, we sustain our families for the remaining nine months and pay back our loans,” he told The Hindu . However, the nationwide lockdown in 2020 and the restrictions in April followed by the lockdown in May this year had robbed off their opportunities, causing financial distress to the artistes, he said. The 60-year-old Mr. Nanjappan, who has been playing the percussion instrument thavil for the past 45 years, said that they had petitioned Chief Minister M.K. Stalin and the Coimbatore district administration in May regarding their plight, but no response had been received, so far. His 32-year-old son N. Sathish, a fourth-generation thavil player, said that some of the folk artistes who were members of the welfare board received cash assistance of Rs. 2,000 last year from the State government. However, no cash assistance was provided to the artistes this year, he alleged. Many weddings that were held during the pandemic did not hire nadaswaram and thavil artistes despite these instruments being a part of weddings, he said. With no other employment opportunities at hand, the folk artistes resort to taking loans from known circles and even mortgaging jewellery, Mr. Nanjappan said. “We have to somehow survive,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/folk-artistes-seek-govts-attention-to-their-plight/article34959252.ece
25 June 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Greater caution advised while giving devices to children for online classes||A woman from Coimbatore rural approached the Cyber Cell of the Coimbatore District (Rural) Police two months ago after she found that around Rs. 30,000 was missing from her bank account without her knowledge. Though she had approached the Cyber Cell seeking an investigation into the loss of money, she returned home in shock after coming to know that it was her son studying in class X who had spent the money for online games. Officials at the Cyber Cell found out that the boy had been playing different games on the mobile which was given to him for online classes and he used the parent’s bank account for purchasing addons and gadgets in online games. The boy had made online payments of small sums on multiple occasions and the parent did not get alerts on the withdrawals. This is not an isolated case as many parents who lost money later identified from banks and from detailed account statements that their children themselves had used the money for various needs including gaming. According to Cyber Cell officers, parents must exercise greater caution while giving mobile phones, tablets and computers to children for online classes as chances are high for them to get attracted to online games, social media and video streaming platforms. T. Arulanandam, State auditor of Tamil Nadu High Higher Secondary School Graduate Teachers Association, said parents and elders should ensure supervision when children used mobile phones and tablets for classes. “Working parents should ensure that someone is there in the house to monitor them or enable parental control options in devices to check their activities,” he said. Rural Superintendent of Police S. Selvanagarathinam has urged parents to use parental control options in devices to restrict the content which children can access. This would also help in restricting obscene advertisements and pop-up advertisements while using browsers and streaming platforms. In the Android platform, parental control options can be enabled through the Google Play app (tap the profile icon at the top right-settings-family-parental controls-turn on parental controls). Parental controls can also be done in Android devices by choosing options in the ‘digital wellbeing and parental control’ section in settings. In iOS devices, parental control can be done by choosing various options in the ‘Screen Time’ section in settings. The app ‘Google Family Link for parents’ also offers advanced options of parental control of devices used by children and teenagers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/greater-caution-advised-while-giving-devices-to-children-for-online-classes/article34959265.ece

Kasthurirangaian, chairman of Indian Wind Power Association, nearly 85 % of the energy generated is evacuated. However, the wind mills face grid drops. The State is having one of its peak windy months and the winds are high this year.

25 June 2021||PUDUKOTTAI,TAMIL NADU||Two held for depositing fake currencies in ATM||The District Crime Branch here arrested two persons on Thursday on a charge of depositing counterfeit currencies in the denomination of Rs. 2,000 to the tune of Rs. 60,000, with the knowledge that they were fake notes, in a public sector bank’s ATM at Aranthangi recently. V. Saravanan, 34, of Kambankudi near Aranthangi and his relative V. Ravichandran, 41, of Karaikudi were arrested on a complaint lodged by the bank’s branch manager. Police sources said Ravichandran who was employed in Oman returned to India in February and could not leave again due to suspension of fights in the wake of lockdown clamped to check the spread of COVID-19. Ravichandran apparently surfed the net and watched videos on ‘doubling money.’ He found a contact, an African, on the Net and left for Bengaluru in May-end. Ravichandran was asked to bring currencies in Rs. 2,000 denomination to double the money. Ravichandran handed over Rs. 50,000 cash to the African man who gave him a bag containing counterfeit cash for Rs. 60,000. Ravichandran tried in a vain bid to contact the African man and returned to Karaikudi knowing that he had been cheated. He narrated the incident to his relative Saravanan who took the currencies to the ATM in Aranthangi to deposit in his wife’s account. As he could not get the acknowledgement slip after depositing the cash, Saravanan contacted the bank’s branch manager. However, the manager found that the currency notes deposited in the machine were fake and lodged a complaint with the Superintendent of Police in Pudukottai a few days ago. The complaint was referred to the District Crime Branch which conducted inquiries with Saravanan after examining the video footage during which the entire crime came to light. Saravanan and Ravichandran were arrested and remanded to judicial custody. A case under IPC section 489 B (using as genuine, forged or counterfeit currency-notes or bank-notes) has been registered against the accused.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/two-held-for-depositing-fake-currencies-in-atm/article34959553.ece

25 June 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Tangedco takes up maintenance work||The Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (TANGEDCO) has completed maintenance of 26 substations and 111 power lines during the last five days to ensure uninterrupted power supply to the residents during the pandemic. As maintenance work was not taken up in sub-stations during the last two months, it led to frequent interruption in power supply so that the TANGEDCO initiated steps for completing the exercise. Instead of clamping daylong power-cuts in the areas where the maintenance is being done, the TANGEDCO workers stopped power supply to the consumers only for 3 hours to complete the work. After inspecting the work near Muthaiahpuram on Thursday, Superintending Engineer J.A. Gnaneswaran said maintenance of relays, transformers, feeders, air releasing devices and aluminium bars in 26 sub-stations were completed between June 19 and 23. Moreover, the creepers grown on the transformers, electric poles, power cables and branches of trees coming in contact with the power cables were removed at 1,361 places during these five days. Reinstalled A total of 116 damaged and slant electric poles had been reinstalled in the right position while 301 damaged insulators were replaced. Moreover, 26 new electric poles had been installed in the places where the power cables were gradually drooping to pose a serious threat to the public and vehicles passing through these roads. “We’ve planned to complete this exercise by June 28 which will ensure uninterrupted power supply to the consumers in the coming days,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tangedco-takes-up-maintenance-work/article34959498.ece
25 June 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Bus stand plan brings STP revamp exercise to a halt||In the wake of a proposal to build an integrated bus stand at Panchapur on Tiruchi-Madurai highway on the outskirts of the city, the Tiruchi Corporation has decided to suspend its plan to revamp the Panjapur sewage treatment plant (STP). The Corporation constructed the 87 MLD plant as part of phase-I of the underground drainage project on a vast tract of its land in 1995. After processing, the treated sewage water is being let into the open land which was made as waste stabilisation ponds. However, out of the 87 MLD, the Corporation used only a portion of the land to process 57 MLD of sewage water. Another portion of the land remains unused. With the idea of bringing the unused land to use, the Corporation prepared a plan. Since the unused land is needed to be modified in accordance with the waste stabilisation pond method, it began the task of establishing the required infrastructure in January this year. It was one of the components of phase-II underground drainage project being under implementation in different parts of the city. It is learnt that the work has been stopped with immediate effect following the State government’s proposal to build an integrated bus stand here. The civic body owns about 570 acres of land in Panchapur. About one fourth of the land is being used for re-using the treated water from the sewage treatment plant. The Corporation plans to allot at least 50 acres of land for building the bus stand with all modern facilities. The move to stop the modification of unused land into waste stabilisation ponds is to enable the authorities to shortlist a suitable site for the bus stand project. “We are in the process of finding the best possible site for the bus stand. Hence, we have decided to stop the process to set up waste stablisation ponds,” says a senior corporation official. After a detailed study, the sewage treatment plant for the phase-II UGD project would be moved to a remote location of 570 acres of the land at Panchapur, the official added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bus-stand-plan-brings-stp-revamp-exercise-to-a-halt/article34959550.ece
25 June 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Akila gets its very own pond to have a splash||Splashing water on itself with its trunk and moving about freely and sometimes lying in the pool of water to beat the heat, 19-year-old Akila - the elephant of Sri Jambukeswarar Akilandeswari Temple at Tiruvanaikoil here thoroughly enjoyed its bath in the pond built exclusively for the pachyderm on the huge temple complex. Akila was in a joyous mood on Thursday afternoon during the nearly hour-long bath it had in the pond set up on the 1.5 acre Nachiarthoppu which is in close proximity to the elephant’s shelter. It was brought by its mahout and his assistant for the bath. The six-foot-deep pond is spacious so that the elephant can move about freely and relax itself in the pool of water, said the temple’s executive officer C. Mariappan. There is a ramp for the elephant to get inside the pond. From now on, Akila, the darling of devotees, will have its daily bath in the pond, created with substantial contributions from donors, Mr. Mariappan said. Earlier it used to be given a bath using a shower system near its shelter. A borewell has been sunk to fill the pond with groundwater which will be pumped out and used for the temple garden after the bath, Mr. Mariappan said. During the lockdown, 100 coconut tree saplings, 100 mango tree saplings and some jackfruit tree saplings were planted in the Nachiarthoppu so that there will be greenery around the pond. Walking track too Akila is used to be taken for a morning walk daily on the newly created mud track inside the Nachiarthoppu. The elephant, born in May 2002 in Assam, was brought to the Tiruvanaikoil temple in December 2011 after the demise of its predecessor Shanthi. The Tiruvanaikoil temple is situated on 19.5 acres and is a ‘pancha bootha sthalam’ representing one of the five elements - water.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/akila-gets-its-very-own-pond-to-have-a-splash/article34959545.ece
25 June 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Omni bus operators in a quandary||With the State government yet to permit operation of bus services, omni bus operators say they are struggling to stay afloat. On an average day, the omni bus stand here would be brimming with crowd, food stalls serving food to travellers, and passengers waiting to board buses. However, over the last few months, things have not been the same after the COVID-19 induced lockdown. The bus owners hope that the government would come to their rescue Speaking to The Hindu , R. Balakrishnan, president, Tiruchi Omni Bus Operators’ Association, said that the past year was one of difficult and trying times. “We are unable to pay bus drivers, cleaners and other staff. We also have hefty loans to pay off. We are unsure of how to go about it,” he said. The omni buses ply to Thanjavur, Kumbakonam, Nagapattinam, Puducherry, Madurai, and even as far as Chennai and Bengaluru. “Most of our customers were people travelling to Chennai and Bengaluru for work. There was not a single bus service which plied to Chennai and Bengaluru empty,” a bus owner said. In the last year, however, not a single trip has been satisfactory, Mr. Balakrishnan said. “If the bus went from here to a certain destination, it will return empty. These kinds of trips cause more harm than good as the costs of the trip double, with not enough income,” he said. A section of bus operators are firm on their decision that they would not begin ferrying passengers until the road tax was waived. “Members of our associations are going to meet the Transport Minister and also submit a petition to the Chief Minister. We cannot go on like this,” Mr. Balakrishnan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/omni-bus-operators-in-a-quandary/article34959552.ece
25 June 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Demand for English medium sections goes up in government schools||A combination of two factors, ‘Samacheer Kalvi’ and high fee structure in matriculation schools, seem to be working in favour of government and aided schools against the backdrop of the debilitating impact of COVID-19 on the economy, according to school heads who say they are getting lots of enquiries from parents in lower-middle class families for seats in English medium sections. Families where the breadwinners have lost jobs due to the pandemic and have been necessitated to relocate to their native villages are more inclined towards admitting their wards in the nearest government schools, the school heads say. Fee up and up Private schools, in general, collect more fee than the extent fixed by the Committee headed by a reired High Court Judge, parents complain. “I felt it was prudent to shift my children to a government school near my village since the private schools are anticipating a further upward revision of fee,” Kumaresan, who had to relocate to his village after losing his job in a fabrication unit in Thuvakudi, said, adding that in any case, there was no point staying in the town after losing the job. According to Rajamanickam, a headmaster of a government higher secondary school, students enrolled in English medium sections also enjoy the benefit of government’s welfare schemes: nutritious noon meal, textbooks, notebooks, laptop, uniform, footwear, school bag, crayons, colour pencils, geometry box, atlas, shoes, socks, bus pass and bicycles. There is a growing realisation among parents, particularly those in the lower-middle class category, that the quality of education in government schools is far better, he says. While the School Education Department’s policy note for 2020-21 states that the government has appointed sufficient number of teachers in government schools to ensure a comfortable Pupil Teacher Ratio - one teacher for every 30 students - a section of school heads seeks to point out that the sanction of teaching posts has to be increased in view of the rise in workload when English medium sections are started. As such, there are no separate teaching vacancies for English-medium sections, a senior official said. Though the strength of teachers is not an issue during the lockdown period, the shortage will be felt when the in-person classes resume, the school heads say.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/demand-for-english-medium-sections-goes-up-in-government-schools/article34959546.ece

According to the police, Shimul Gazi (30) approached Manikandan, a resident of Ammapalayam, to seek a house for rent in April. Introducing himself as hailing from Bangladesh, he claimed that he was employed as a tailor in a private garment company and that he could not produce photocopies of his documents such as passport and visa as the originals were with the company.

25 June 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Tourism hit in the Nilgiris||In the last one year since the COVID-19 pandemic, tourism industry in the Nilgiris has fallen by a staggering 80%. Based on statistics from the horticulture and tourism departments, which calculate the footfall to the Government Botanical Garden in Udhagamandalam as a barometer to gauge the tourist inflow into the district, the number of tourists to the Nilgiris fell from 28.92 lakh in 2019, prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, to 5.88 lakh in 2020. In 2021, only 63,850 visitors have been recorded. “Cumulatively, since the pandemic began, tourism has fallen by more than 80 %, as most of the visitors in 2020 had visited prior to the first cases being reported in Tamil Nadu,” officials from the horticulture department said. While the gardens and parks were opened once again during the last few months of 2020, the district once again closed to tourists earlier this year after the second wave of infections hit the State. John Bosco, a tourist guide and tour operator in Udhagamandalam, said there were around 120 tourist guides, out of whom 26 are certified guides, who help travellers find their way to popular tourist spots and also help arrange accommodation. “These guides would earn anywhere between Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 2,000 a day during peak season. But due to the pandemic, many are struggling to pay bills and provide for their families,” said Mr. Bosco. Similarly, boatmen at the Ooty Lake and Boat House have also had their livelihoods impacted. According to officials, there are around 40 boatmen at the Ooty Lake and Boat House, and they are paid based on the number of boat trips they make each day. “As the Ooty Lake and Boat House too has not been functioning for the large part of 2020 and 2021, their livelihoods too have been affected,” said an official from the State tourism department. The tourism department has written to the government to provide monetary relief to the boatmen, and officials say they hope that tourists would once again be allowed into the Nilgiris in the coming months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tourism-hit-in-the-nilgiris/article34959262.ece

According to officials, the estate in question, the Silver Cloud Estate, had applied for permission to fell 500 silver oak trees in 2018 and had been given the permission to do so by the district committee headed by the Collector. However, in November and December of 2020 and January of 2021, the estate had felled 200 native trees along with the 500 trees they had been given permission for felling. Illegal tree felling Recently, officials from Nilgiris Forest Division visited the estate and found that they had illegally felled the trees and booked a case under the Tamil Nadu Preservation of Private Forests Act. Disciplinary action had been initiated against two forest range officers, one forester and a guard who had since been suspended, forest officials confirmed. The four had been posted in-charge of the range when the illegal felling occurred. Illegal tree felling without proper permission has become a source of concern in the Nilgiris forest division. Recently, reports of private estate owners circumventing established procedures to obtain permission to fell trees by claiming them to be at risk of falling on houses led the department to set up a check-post in Kil Kotagiri to prevent illegal movement of timber from the area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/four-forest-staff-suspended/article34959273.ece

Meghanath Reddy has warned local cable television operators and multi-system operators against promoting cable connections of private operators among subscribers of Tamil Nadu Arasu Cable TV Corporation. In a press release, he said that TACTV has so far distributed 1.47 lakh set top boxes through which subscribers get cable TV signal for a monthly charge of Rs. 140 plus GST. However, some operators were telling subscribers that TACTV signal would no more be offered. After getting the TACTV set top boxes from the subscribers they were providing set top boxes of private cable operators and were causing revenue loss to the State exchequer. The local cable operators who had taken such TACTV set top boxes from the subscribers had neither activated them nor handed them over to TACTV office for the last three months. The Collector warned of stringent action against such operators and MSOs. If the set top boxes developed technical snag or if the connection were snapped for non-payment of monthly subscription charges or if the subscribers had shifted from one place to another, they should hand over the set top box along with the adaptor and remote control device to the local cable TV operator. Subscribers who are forced to switch over from TACTV connections to private operators’ cable TV connections can lodge complaint over 04562-252257 or 94980-02598.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/warning-to-cable-tv-operators/article34959486.ece

25 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Distribution of dry ration kits gets mired in controversy||The State’s initiative to distribute dry ration kits to migrant construction workers at a cost of over Rs. 31 crore as part of lockdown relief has run into rough weather. While there are instances of legislators misusing the welfare measure to bolster their own image, there are also complaints of poor quality foodgrains, bought at a higher cost, reaching beneficiaries. The government has started distribution of kits costing Rs. 823 each containing 10 grocery items. This was after a nudge from the Supreme Court, High Court of Karnataka, and Karnataka Legal Services Authority which asked the government to ensure there are no hunger deaths. ‘Unfit for consumption’ As the kits have started reaching people, reports of poor quality grain being provided are emerging. “Many workers to whom we distributed kits in Bommanahalli area have complained that foodgrains are unfit for consumption,” Lingaraju, CITU district secretary, said. Across unions, members claimed that the best quality foodgrains were available in the open market for about Rs. 650. “Retail price of what is being distributed by the government has been estimated to be about Rs. 530,” said Mr. Lingaraju. However, Labour Commissioner and Chairman of the Karnataka Construction Workers Welfare Board Akram Pasha said Rs. 823 per kit had been approved by the Finance Ministry. About 3.8 lakh kits, costing Rs. 31.27 crore to the Karnataka Construction Workers Welfare Fund, are to be distributed across the State, and about 1.2 lakh kits have been distributed already, Labour Department sources confirmed. The unions, in a meeting on June 9 with Labour Minister A. Shivaram Hebbar, opposed the very idea of providing ration kits at this point and also questioned distribution method. They had, instead, sought Rs. 10,000 per month for three months starting from May for workers through direct benefit transfer. The cash bailout, the unions argued, would also spur the demand in the economy. Many felt it was too late in the day to distribute foodgrains since lockdown has been lifted. Sources in the department said that about 2 lakh kits were being distributed in Bengaluru through legislators, an issue unions have flagged. “The government is committed to providing 54,640 kits to be distributed through 13 trade unions. Even half of these have not been given yet,” said Muniraju Shamanna, AITUC Bengaluru district vice-president who took part in the June 9 meeting. Benefit to voters “We had put forth our condition not to involve legislators in the distribution, which was not agreed to by the government. The result is that most of the beneficiaries are voters of these legislators,” Karnataka State Building and Other Construction Workers Federation general secretary K. Mahantesh said. For unions such as INTUC, the assured food kits of about 10,000 are yet to reach, union president S.S. Prakasham rued. However, a senior official justified the involvement of legislators saying that the kits have been given to only those in whose constituencies large clusters of migrant workers are found. He, however, admitted it wasdifficult to ascertain if the kits given were the same as those given by the department since legislators were also distributing ration on their own. Mr. Pasha said that though legislators were involved, only registered workers will get kits. He said of about 7 lakh registered workers, 3.8 lakh would get benefits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/distribution-of-dry-ration-kits-gets-mired-in-controversy/article34959200.ece
25 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Suburban rail work to start in 3 months||After years of waiting, work on the 148-km suburban rail link for Bengaluru is slated to begin in three months. The State government has decided to invite the Prime Minister for the function, said Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Thursday, after reviewing progress of the doubling project between Cantonment and Heelalige. He travelled in a self-propelled inspection car for a distance of 31 km. The suburban rail project has four corridors: KSR Bengaluru – Devanahalli (41 km), Baiyappanahalli – Chikkabanavara (25.14 km), Kengeri – Whitefield (35.52 km), and Heelalige – Rajankunte (46.24 km). “I will request the Prime Minister to lay the foundation stone and I am 100% confident that he will come. The Union government has given approval for raising Rs. 7,000 crore loan for the project,” said Mr. Yediyurappa. Work will be taken up on the Baiyappanahalli-Chikkabanavara and Heelalige-Rajankunte corridors, and it will be completed in three and a half years, said a senior official. “Around 88% of the land required for the project is readily available. That is one of the major advantages we have with the project. The designing and financial modules have been approved. Tenders will be floated for construction work and in three months works will start,” said the official. The completion of elevated sections will be prioritised. “However, carrying out construction work on the same corridors where Indian Railways is operational is one of the major challenges,” he added. The suburban rail project is estimated to cost Rs. 15,767 crore. Both the State and Union governments will each bear 20% of the cost, while the remaining 60% will be raised through external sources. The State government has already released Rs. 400 crore. Doubling project The Rail Infrastructure Development Company (Karnataka) Ltd. (K-RIDE), which is executing the suburban rail project, has undertaken doubling work on two sections: Baiyappanahalli – Hosur and Yeshwantpur – Channasandra. The two doubling projects were sanctioned in the 2018-19, with 50:50 cost sharing by the State government and the Railways. The year 2023 has been set as the deadline to complete the work. The 48-km Baiyappanahalli to Hosur section line doubling is estimated to cost Rs. 499 crore. The State government has released Rs. 65 crore towards the project. Various factors during the second wave of COVID-19, from construction workers returning home to shortage of construction material, affected its progress. The doubling of the 22-km Yeshwanthpur-Channasandra section is estimated to cost Rs. 315 crore.  The designing and financial modules have been approved. Tenders will soon be floated for construction work GOVT. OFFICIAL||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/suburban-rail-work-to-start-in-3-months/article34959186.ece

Suresh Kumar has directed the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Chief Commissioner to relieve teachers from COVID-19-related duty. Mr. Kumar said teachers were needed to conduct admission campaigns and undertake work related to the upcoming board examination. “The list of teaching and non-teaching staff involved in examination work will be provided by the deputy directors of public instruction and they should be vaccinated on priority before the commencement of the SSLC examination,” Mr. Kumar said in his letter. The number of examination centres have been increased to 6,000 so that students can follow social distancing norms. “This will require more invigilators and teachers who will be deployed on SSLC examination duty,” stated a press release quoting the Minister. For college students The Higher Education Department will take a decision on whether physical classes can be conducted in July after all students above the age of 18, and teaching and non-teaching staff receive their first dose of vaccine. In a press release, Higher Education Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan said the department had decided to conduct vaccination drives at the college level. “The date of reopening of offline classes will be announced soon after the completion of the first dose of vaccination to all eligible students and staff,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/relieve-teachers-from-covid-19-duty/article34959202.ece
25 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Dormant Ward DETER Committees to be reactivated||The civic body is set to reactivate the Ward Decentralised Triage and Emergency Response (DETER) Committees for COVID-19 management. They had been constituted during the peak of the second wave of the pandemic for decentralised management, but barring a few most have become dormant. Senior officials of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) admitted that a few WDCs had not even met to discuss ward-level plans for COVID-19 management after they were constituted. With the outbreak of a third wave predicted in six to eight weeks, civic officials and civil society organisations have underscored the need to reactivate these committees. While there is no data readily available on the number of active WDCs, anecdotal evidence suggests the number is a low 20 of the total 198 committees constituted. Sapna Karim, head of civic participation, Janaagraha Centre for Citizenship and Democracy, said the active WDCs were driven by adept nodal officers working closely with volunteers. “It is important to strengthen this system to ramp up vaccination. With the caseload decreasing, this is the right time for capacity building and strengthening WDCs.” The WDC in Doddanekundi ward is one of the few that are active. Volunteers and members, who are also part of the ward committee, continue to closely monitor COVID-19 patients under home isolation and coordinate with the six testing teams deputed to different colonies and slum pockets in the ward. But that is not enough, according to urban expert Kathyayini Chamaraj from CIVIC. She said the committees should ideally work on four major roles — preparedness, response, mitigation, and recovery. “These committees are only active in the response role, ignoring the other three major roles. The WDCs should not be disbanded and should be constituted as and when the need arises,” she said. Concurring with civic experts, BBMP Special Commissioner (Health) D. Randeep told The Hindu that over the next two weeks, nodal officials would be directed to reactivate these WDCs. Committee members would also be directed to work with primary health centres and physical triage centres. “This way, there will be complete ownership of decentralised COVID-19management at the ward level,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dormant-ward-deter-committees-to-be-reactivated/article34959175.ece

The proctor allegedly used an inappropriate word to instruct students when he was invigilating an online even-semester exam last week. A two-member committee of faculty members has been set uto look into allegations made by students and students’ organisations, said Fr. Dr. Abraham V.M., Vice-Chancellor.

The university also wrote to students last Tuesday stating that they could get in touch with their class counsellors, class teachers, mentors, and peer mentors if they needed psychological support.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/christ-deemed-to-be-university-to-probe-proctors-misconduct/article34959177.ece
25 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Murder of former councillor: eyewitnesses flee from scene||Four police teams have been formed to track down those who hacked 45-year-old Rekha Kadiresh to death in front of her office at Cottonpet on Thursday morning. The police are having a tough time getting people to come forward. “The attack was so brutal that although many people had gathered at the office and witnessed the murder, they ran away. No one is coming forward to give their statements,” a police officer said. Though the CCTV cameras outside the office had been turned away, the police have scanned footage from other cameras and have identified three men. “Two of the suspects were close confidants of the councillor. We have footage of them fleeing the scene on foot. The third suspect helped them escape,” said a senior police officer. The brutality of the attack and the fact that it was carried out in broad daylight has made this a high-profile case. Both Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai called Bengaluru Police Commissioner Kamal Pant directing him to crack the case at the earliest. ‘Politically motivated’ BJP city unit spokesperson N.R. Ramesh alleged political rivalry as the motive. “She was a popular leader in the area, and the party had decided to nominate her again and she was expected to win. With the council polls approaching, other aspirants desperate to win the seat from Chalavadipalya seem to have killed her,” he claimed. Mr. Ramesh, while expressing confidence that the police would arrest the accused, claimed there were larger forces at play. He cited the murder of the councillor’s husband, Kadiresh S., a rowdy-sheeter, who was hacked to death near Muneshwara Temple in Chalavadipalya. “There were bigger forces behind the murder of Kadiresh in 2018, which was never probed. The police were content with filing a charge-sheet against those who surrendered voluntarily,” he said. Though he did not make any direct allegation against him, Mr. Ramesh said Chamarajpet MLA B.Z. Zameer Ahmed Khan, in whose constituency Chalavadipalya lies, was encouraging “anti-social elements”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/murder-of-former-councillor-eyewitnesses-flee-from-scene/article34959179.ece

25 June 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Vaccination on people’s doorsteps begins in Dakshina Kannada||Though she wanted to get vaccinated against COVID-19, 85-year-old Agnes Quadros, a resident of Bethany Convent’s Mother Martha Memorial Senior Citizens Home in Attavar in Mangaluru, found it difficult to go to the nearby government health centre as she had difficulty in walking. However, on Thursday, she came down from her room with a walker to the designated place in the Home to receive a dose of Covaxin. Similarly, 83-year-old Amy Correa and Irene Cuvello (73), who stay near the Home, were also inoculated. These three were among the 40 senior citizens to be inoculated at the Home as part of the drive taken up by the Dakshina Kannada district administration to vaccinate elderly persons and bed-ridden people on their doorsteps. As many as seven elderly persons, including a couple who are bed-ridden, with dementia staying in Susheg Jivith Care Centre, also in Attavar, and 13 other elderly residents in that locality received the vaccine at the care centre. The district administration commenced the drive on Thursday and this is being done in association with the Indian Red Cross Society, Dakshina Kannada, the Rotary Club of Mangaluru and the Bank of Baroda. Secretary of Indian Red Cross Society S.A. Prabhakar Sharma said that the portal of the district administration has received more than 1,500 requests for vaccination on people’s doorsteps. “We are classifying them based on their areas of residence and are holding camps at a location that is closer to them,” he said. Health workers of the urban primary health centres concerned inoculate the beneficiaries at the chosen location. Of the 22 residents of the Home, 20 came forward to take the vaccine. Administrator of the Home Sister Sangeeta said that swabs of all residents were recently checked and they returned negative for COVID-19. The vaccination process started 10 a.m. and ended at 11.30 a.m. Vaccination at the Susheg Jivith Care Centre started at noon. Lavina M. Noronha, a trustee of Susheg Charitable Trust, said that all the seven residents of the centre have reported negative for COVID-19. Care was taken to calm down anxious recipients before inoculating them at the care centre. Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra and MLA D. Vedavyas Kamath, who visited the Home, said that steps are being taken to strengthen door-to-door vaccination drive. Mayor Premanand Shetty and councillors Jecintha Vijaya Alfred, Divakar and Shailesh Shetty were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vaccination-on-peoples-doorsteps-begins-in-dakshina-kannada/article34959344.ece
25 June 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Campaign to promote ‘Bili Bende’ in Udupi district||In a concerted effort by elected representatives, the Horticulture Department and a cooperative society, a campaign has been launched in Karkala, Udupi district, to promote the cultivation of a local variety, “Bili Bende” (white okra), involving 20,000 families under the brand name “Kaarla Bende”. Kaarla in Tulu means Karkala. Karkala MLA V. Sunil Kumar, who has taken the initiative, told The Hindu that the free seed distribution in his Assembly constituency covering Karkala and Hebri taluks began on June 1 and it went on for a fortnight covering 20,000 families. Though white okra is cultivated in other parts of the coastal belt, the type cultivated in Karkala and its surrounding areas grows to one feet in length. Hence, the campaign has been launched to make it a brand of Karkala. Its seeds have been procured from some local farmers and the Zonal Agricultural and Horticultural Research Station, Brahmavar, in Udupi district. The seeds were distributed through the help of gram panchayat members to three category of growers. They were given to those who sowed them within their compound walls in pots, growbags or in their kitchen garden; in about 10 to 15 cents of land; and to those who took up its cultivation in a large-scale manner on 25 cents of land and more. Stating that the “Bili Bende” began to yield in two months of planting, Mr. Kumar said that people will be urged to make any one dish out of it during functions and events in their houses to promote its vast use locally. Marketing link will be arranged to large growers to sell them in cities. A written material on how to cultivate the variety and its pest management was circulated on social media to reach out to people. Naveenchandra Jain, president of Parampara Multipurpose Cooperative Society, Karkala, which has also joined the campaign, said that the white okra has high fibre content. A variety of dishes can be made from it. Earlier, in January, the MLA had launched an initiative to promote the cultivation and marketing of a local variety of boiled rice under the brand name “Kaarla Kaje” which is being marketed by the same cooperative society. The MLA said that both the brand building activities have been taken up under “vocal4local” initiative. Mr. Kumar said that the cultivation of “Kaarla Kaje” will be promoted among 1,000 farmers in the current kharif season.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/campaign-to-promote-bili-bende-in-udupi-district/article34959346.ece

25 June 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Land deals: Sindhuri for comprehensive probe||The former Deputy Commissioner of Mysuru Rohini Sindhuri has called for expanding the scope of inquiry into the irregularities in land deals in the district to cover all technical issues, on the lines of the probe into construction of a swimming pool at the Deputy Commissioner’s residence in the city during her tenure. Ms. Sindhuri, who was transferred out of Mysuru following a public spat with the Mysuru City Corporation Commissioner Shilpa Nag, was embroiled in a controversy over the construction of the pool during the peak of the pandemic. After her transfer, Regional Commissioner G.C. Prakash was ordered to conduct an inquiry based on the complaint of a few JD(S) leaders and he submitted a report identifying six lapses. This included absence of approval from the technical department of the Public Works Department besides raising questions on the public utility of the pool. Responding to the report Ms. Sindhuri claimed the original allegations of misuse of COVID-19 funds for construction of the swimming pool were found to be false and hence the inquiry drifted away from it to raise only technical issues. Incidentally, the Regional Commissioner recently issued a clean chit to MLA for K.R. Nagar S.R. Mahesh on the construction of a choultry on a swathe of land in Mysuru which Ms. Sindhuri had flagged as illegal. She said a detailed inquiry trying to cover the widest breadth of even technical issues on the swimming pool issue was welcome. “But I wish the same detail and comprehensiveness is shown in inquiry into irregularities in land transactions by powerful politicians,” she added. The irregularities cited by her include land conversion in favour of Mr. Mahesh of nearly 1.39 acres in survey number 124/2, Lingambudhi village, Mysuru taulk, which was contrary to the Comprehensive Development Plan of Mysuru. But the inquiry into land irregularities was restricted to a single point — on whether it was constructed on a ‘rajakaluve’ or not – despite a list of multiple irregularities cited by her as the Deputy Commissioner of Mysuru, said Ms. Sindhuri. Meanwhile, Mr. Mahesh has threatened to initiate a breach of privilege motion against Ms. Sindhuri besides suing her for defamation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/land-deals-sindhuri-for-comprehensive-probe/article34959194.ece
25 June 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Three more Delta variant cases of COVID detected in Mysuru||Three more Delta variants of COVID-19 have been detected in Mysuru. This was confirmed by the lab at NIMHANS, Bengaluru, that carried out genome sequencing of the samples sent from the district. Mysuru District Health Officer K.H. Prasad confirmed to The Hindu the discovery of three more Delta cases, but he underlined that they were not Delta Plus variant. One Delta Plus variant was reported from Mysuru a few days ago. Out of the four Delta cases detected so far in Mysuru, three are Delta variants B1.617.2 and one is Delta Plus variant B1.617.2.1. “With the finding of more cases of Delta variants of the coronavirus, we have taken all necessary precautions,” he said. Dr. Prasad said the cases of Delta strains were detected in the same batch of 20 samples sent in May. These samples represented nearly 30,000 COVID-19 cases that were reported in that month, the DHO said, adding that samples from Mysuru are sent for genome sequencing once in 15 days. Another batch of 20-25 samples have been sent to the NIMHANS and the results are awaited, he said. None of patients, who are youngsters, infected by the Delta variants have shown any symptoms, with three of them who have recovered being in home isolation and one at a COVID-19 Care Center. “No deaths have occurred because of the variants and we are keeping tabs on their health status despite their being fully recovered,” the DHO said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/three-more-delta-variant-cases-of-covid-detected-in-mysuru/article34959176.ece

Shivakumar to become the next Chief Minister has peaked but they must understand that the BJP will again come to power in the State. He was speaking to reporters in Raichur on Thursday. Mr. Kateel said that Congress leaders will always show interest in and fight for power but not to protect and serve public interest. To a question, he replied that there is no groupism and differences among BJP leaders. “Minister C.P. Yogeshwar and MLA Arvind Bellad have not been involved in any dissident activities. They just met the Suttur seer in their personal capacity as they have liberty to visit any seer on their own,” Mr. Kateel said. When asked about the phone-tapping allegation, the BJP State president said that investigation is under way and the truth will come out after the completion of investigation. He defended MLA Ramesh Jarkiholi meeting the former Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and said that “nothing is wrong in meeting our leaders and Mr. Jarkiholi has not brought pressure to bear on us for a Ministerial berth.” Mr. Kateel also said that he will talk to MLC H. Vishwanath to discuss his repeated remarks over the Chief Minister and party as well.

The university will also need the nod of the government for continuing with these courses,” said Sabu Thomas, Vice Chancellor. An ordinance promulgated by the government as part of launching the open university had barred other universities from offering open and distance learning courses and private registrations. However, the delay on the part of the DEB in opening its web portal following the COVID-19 spread had affected SGNOU’s plans to offer the courses. Facilities ready Prof. Thomas said the varsity was ready to go ahead with the OLD courses, as it had the required infrastructural and academic facilities. The university has been offering open and distance learning courses successfully, he added. The UGC had permitted universities to offer ODL programmes if they had a minimum National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) score of 3.01 or figured among the top 100 ranks in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF). MGU is ranked 30 in the NIRF and has a cumulative grade point average of 3.24 under NAAC assessment . The government’s decision to bring ODL programmes under SGNOU had hit the revenue of varsities, as distance learning courses offered a steady revenue stream. Moreover, there were also many takers for the courses.  We have applied for permission from the Distance Education Bureau of UGC.

Josephine has said. The move comes close on the heels of the public outrage over the death of a 24-year-old woman at her in-laws’ house in Kollam on Monday, in a suspected case of dowry harassment. Her husband had been arrested and slapped with charges under Sections 498A (subjecting a woman to cruelty for dowry) and 304B (dowry death) of the Indian Penal Code. “The commission has consulted legal minds on the possible laws that could be initiated, and it will be presented before the government soon for follow-up action,” Ms. Josephine says. The commission has found that people continue to give dowry in various other names even though it is prohibited under law, and despite several incidents of dowry-related deaths and harassment. Several complaints Ms. Josephine says the commission has received several complaints alleging that the husband’s family has taken possession of the money and gold given to the bride by her parents. “There should also be a law to regulate expensive weddings in the State. We have to keep a ceiling on the expenditure and the commission will recommend it based on legal opinion,” she said. Kerala recorded 66 dowry-related deaths between 2016 and 2020 under the category of ‘crime against women’ as per the data with the State Crime Records Bureau.

25 June 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Children in five more districts to benefit from Kaval Plus project||Buoyed by the success of the pilot project in two districts, the Department of Women and Child Development in Kerala is set to expand Kaval Plus, an ambitious programme for lending holistic support to children in need of care and protection and survivors of sexual abuse, to five more districts. Since its rollout in Thiruvananthapuram and Palakkad districts in December 2020, the project has been able to reach out to nearly 300 and 150 children respectively. Now, the project is set to be implemented in Ernakulam, Idukki, Malappuram, Kozhikode, and Kannur. “The impact of the pilot project has been very good. While it covers both children at homes and child care institutes, we are also focussing on vulnerable children in the community outside the ambit of child welfare committees (CWCs) and other agencies,” said T. V. Anupama, director, women and child development department. The 15 children’s homes in Kerala account for nearly 500 residents, leaving nearly 96% of high-risk children in need of support unprotected in the community.  Identification "We are about to introduce an early identification system using community-level workers, including Asha and Anganwadi workers," said Kavitha Manoj, State Project Coordinator of Kaval Plus. The project is being implemented with the help of NGOs experienced in working with the children. Two NGOs each are selected in each district by a committee comprising the district child protection officer, CWC representative and protection officer (non-institutional care). The chosen NGOs, however, will not work in silos but closely in association with the child protection agencies. The beneficiaries of the project are usually identified from among the children produced before CWCs who in turn will hand them to the district child protection units for social investigation as per the Juvenile Justice Act. Based on those reports, cases found fit will be handed over to Kaval Plus. "NGOs will then have to make an evaluation and draw up individual care plan for each child. We then offer children a holistic psycho-socio, economic and educational support besides family strengthening sessions and group work. Children with mental health issues will be referred to district mental health authorities," said Ms. Manoj.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/children-in-five-more-districts-to-benefit-from-kaval-plus-project/article34959406.ece
25 June 2021||Kochi,KERALA||M.G. Road-NH bypass stretch could become first bus-priority corridor||The M.G. Road-Thammanam-NH bypass road that the Kerala Road Fund Board (KRFB) would develop as a four-lane corridor holds potential to be developed as Kochi’s first bus-priority corridor, to encourage public transport buses to operate along the stretch and to lessen the influx of private vehicles into the city, urban transport experts said. The four-km road whose DPR is expected to be ready in a month, is expected to considerably augment east-west connectivity in the city, by lessening distance and commuting time to the city hub and back. The DPR would contain details like the precise alignment for the 22-metre-wide road and key components like an overbridge envisaged at Kathrikadavu in order to prevent traffic snarls at the junction and space for cycle tracks on either side. The CEO of WRI India and former urban transport specialist of World Bank O.P. Agarwal said that a bus-priority corridor or a bus-rapid corridor can be readied in a road which has six lanes. In this case, the average width of the road (Thammanam-Pullepady road and its extensions to M.G. Road and NH bypass) is less than two lanes in most areas. By widening it to four lane, its width would be more than doubled by adding space, unlike in the case of a pre-existing road from where extracting a lane for buses would mean taking away space, thus reducing its width. In the case of the upcoming M.G. Road-NH bypass stretch, one lane on each side could thus be set apart as bus-priority corridor, furthering the cause of public transport, he said.  Sources in the Kerala Metropolitan Transport Authority said that it is high time buses operated through routes which hitherto had little or no public transport. “Thus, buses from passenger-dense routes like West Kochi could operate through Kundannoor bridge or the upcoming MG Road-NH bypass corridor, providing direct link to hubs like Vyttila and suburban towns like Thripunithura and Kakkanad. Mini buses too could be tried out.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mg-road-nh-bypass-stretch-could-become-first-bus-priority-corridor/article34959408.ece

The 16th century structure, which was a place of worship for the Malabari Jews, has been in a dilapidated condition for over three decades. The Archaeology Department intervened after a portion of the roof of the synagogue and its facade collapsed in 2019 owing to heavy rain. The Kerala High Court had also directed the authorities to expedite measures to acquire land. On Thursday, local residents led by M.H.M. Ashraf, councillor of the Kochi Corporation representing Kochangadi division, stopped workers engaged by the Archaeology Department from clearing the overgrown weeds at the site. A similar protest was held at the site in October last led by T.K. Ashraf, councillor representing Mattancherry division and chairman of the corporation’s Health Standing Committee, alleging that declaring the structure a protected monument will bring with it restrictions on construction around it. E. Dinesan, Director of the State Archaeology Department, clarified that there are no restrictions on construction as the department declares a monument as protected under the provisions of the Kerala Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1969. The regulations on constructions are applicable for monuments declared as protected by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), he said. Mr. Dinesan said that the installation of the temporary roof to prevent the structure from crumbling further was initiated based on requests from various quarters. The process of acquiring land was also in its final stages, he said. Mr. T.K. Ashraf said that they have nothing against protecting the site but will oppose any move to declare it as a protected monument. “Even though the authorities claim that there will be no restrictions on construction around it, our fear is that it will come in place as the chances of ASI taking over the project were high,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/efforts-to-restore-synagogue-fail-again-as-residents-protest/article34959410.ece

25 June 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||He sends women free law books on domestic violence||The recent deaths of three young women allegedly owing to dowry-related violence seems to have scarred the collective conscience of Kerala society. While social media have exploded with hashtag campaigns reflecting the anger against dowry, a store owner in Kochi has embarked on a campaign with a difference. Abdul Latheef, who has been running a popular used-books’ shop near the Ernakulam Press Club for over a decade now, has offered to give the English and Malayalam versions of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act and Rules for free. “If you feel that someone will benefit from a copy of this book, WhatsApp me on 9895648013 the person’s name, address and PIN. Neither questions nor payment will be asked,” he posted on Facebook on Wednesday evening. ‘Disturbing reports’ Mr. Latheef said that it was a small token of solidarity with women trapped in toxic relationships, including marriages. “The reports of the deaths of these women were so disturbing. It is likely to linger in the psyche of all women trapped in such relations. Why would even educated young women keep on suffering? Why don’t they just walk away,” he asks. The book costs less than Rs. 100 and is available in lawbooks shops. Mr. Latheef hopes that the initiative will do its bit in creating awareness about the law for safeguarding women. Appreciation His post has evoked appreciation from women, with some even ringing him up to share their thoughts. Two men have also messaged him requesting the book for their women acquaintances. “Women, it seems, are reluctant to reach out on their own and share their addresses and contact numbers, which are necessary for sending registered posts. Hence, they are probably seeking the help of their male friends,” Mr. Latheef said. Flak too However, it was not all appreciation alone, as a male acquaintance called him to share his displeasure about the initiative, claiming that men too were on the receiving end.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/he-sends-women-free-law-books-on-domestic-violence/article34959431.ece

25 June 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||Experts warn of copycat incidents||Extreme exposure to a singular case of suicide can spark copycat incidents and the widespread media coverage can be counterproductive, say experts. Within two days of the death of Vismaya, a 24-year-old woman in Kollam, a handful of similar cases have been reported in the State and the overwhelming reportage has been pointed out as a reason for this spurt. “Generally, persons who share the same situation of the victim will have a tendency to identify with them. Distressed ones may feel inspired to end their life and it’s a known psychological phenomenon. These are impulsive decisions triggered by an immediate stimuli,” says Harish M.T., former president, Indian Psychiatric Society, Kerala branch. A ripple effect “After Vismaya’s death, similar cases have been reported from Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Alappuzha, and Idukki. It’s a sort of ripple effect as some girls struggling with domestic abuse will see it as an ideal option,” says Thampy Mathai, Director, Maithri, a Kochi-based NGO operating a suicide-prevention helpline for 25 years. Intimate details, video clips, and pictures of the victim on social media also increase the risk factor. Mr. Mathai points out media coverage given to families committing suicide as another example. “It will appear as a sensational story the next day. After most such incidents there will be a string of similar cases,” he says. In people facing mental health issues, this overdose of information can trigger suicidal thoughts. “It’s like putting them on a poisonous diet for a few days. They will start internalising all the negativity in the reports and see suicide as a solution,” says S. Smitha, psychologist. Guidelines for reporting Though the World Health Organisation has issued guidelines for reporting suicides they are rarely followed. “The intention of the media will be good, but their over-indulgence comes with a drawback. While the stories of survivors do not get much attention, suicides are celebrated for days. They should avoid glaring headlines and graphic details at least,” she adds.  Widespread media coverage of deaths by suicide can be counterproductive||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/experts-warn-of-copycat-incidents/article34959421.ece

Budget for NSS for this fiscal||The annual Budget of the Nair Service Society (NSS) for the financial year 2021-22 envisages an income and expenditure of Rs. 132 crore. The 107th Budget of the community organisation, presented by its general secretary G. Sukumaran Nair through videoconferencing here on Thursday, expects an income of Rs. 26.25 crore from the capital sector and Rs. 105.74 crore from the revenue sector. It has also earmarked an expenditure of Rs. 45.30 crore and Rs. 86.69 crore for the capital and revenue sectors respectively. The income expected in the capital sector is through grants under the RUSA projects to colleges; library and laboratory grants; and so on. The sources in the revenue sector, meanwhile, include the NSS development fund of Rs. 17.30 crore, Rs. 10.13 crore from the plantations and Rs. 37. 59 lakh from hospitals.  Under the capital expenditure head, Rs. 12 crore has been earmarked for construction and maintenance sector, of which a major portion will be utilised for the construction of the NSS convention centre at Perunna. While Rs. 3.61 crore has been set aside for construction and maintenance of aided schools and colleges, the health sector will get a cumulative assistance of Rs. 99 lakh. The Budget also announced two new working women’s hostels at Attingal and Thrissur. Dowry prohibition Meanwhile, the meeting adopted a resolution demanding a strong implementation of the Dowry Prohibition Act with relevant amendments. “While the Act defines all valuables transacted or agreed to be transacted between the two parties engaging in a marital relationship as dowry, the valuables gifted to a couple at the time of their marriage has been excluded from this definition. This indeed serves as a loophole to those awarding huge quantity of gold at the time of weddings. Hence, the Union government should amend the Act to include the offering of gold ornaments beyond a specific limit in the scope of dowry,” read the resolution. It also called for strong implementation of the Kerala Dowry Prohibition Rules - 2004, which enables the dowry prohibition officers to prevent the offences in connection with weddings. “Though the law empowers these officials to prosecute those violating the law, these are not being implemented strictly,” it observed. Re-elected The meeting re-elected P.N.

25 June 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Ayurvedic drugs may turn dear in the State||Prices of Ayurvedic drugs in Kerala could go up very soon, with the pandemic-hit manufacturers feeling the pinch of high raw material costs and a drastic fall in business. Indications of this were evident in a recent survey conducted by the Kozhikode and Wayanad district committees of the Ayurvedic Medicine Manufacturers Organisation of India (AMMOI). Around 30 members were included in it. All respondents have sought an increase in medicine prices. Sixty-one per cent of them said raw materials were not available according to their needs, and 93% said they were buying them at a higher price. The cost of production becomes higher, after adding transportation charges. “Price rise of Ayurvedic drugs may be inevitable considering these circumstances. It has been two to three years since the prices were revised in the State,” Manoj Kaloor, AMMOI functionary, said. Dr. Manoj pointed out that over 80% of the 700-odd manufacturers in Kerala operate smaller units. The pandemic, especially the second wave, had a severe impact on them. Financial aid The survey said 54% of manufacturers reported a fall in business by 50%, and others reported a loss of above 50% or 25%. None reported normal business. Around 14.3% got help from banks or other financial institutions, and some of them were due to repay the amount. As much as 61% of respondents reduced their staff. Half of the manufacturers had expected a second wave of the pandemic. Over 60% of respondents said the Drugs Control Department should chip in to help them. Right now, drugs for government Ayurveda hospitals are being purchased from the State-owned Oushadhi. The manufacturers urged the government to buy medicines from other manufacturers as well. The government should also take steps to make available quality raw materials at a low rate. Dr. Manoj said a detailed survey involving more respondents across the State would be held soon. The manufacturers have also sought the setting up of a commission to study the problems facing the sector.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ayurvedic-drugs-may-turn-dearer/article34959392.ece

Overcrowded fish markets and wayside outlets cut a sorry figure on Thursday with long queues in front of them. A fish market near Nadakkavu even drew the attention of passers-by with a long queue of buyers. There was no one to enforce rules there. A few customers even justified the act. Though regulations are in force in critical containment zones, many came out of restricted areas and moved around. The police and other enforcement squads found themselves helpless in the face of the heavy turnout. Even children casually roamed with parents. “Very few taxi drivers complied with the district administration’s orders to limit the number of passengers in vehicles. As regards private vehicle owners, there was no self-regulation at all,” said a Rapid Response Team volunteer from West Hill. He added that the city roads remained crowded with the rise in non-emergency trips. A shop owner at CSI Junction said customers were lax in using hand sanitisers. Meanwhile, sources in the Health Department said sectoral magistrates appointed by the district administration had been asked to tighten checking. They added that the district administration was closely monitoring the situation, and that more curbs would be considered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kozhikode-witnesses-heavy-rush-in-public-places-markets/article34959395.ece
25 June 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Gold smuggling thrives through Calicut airport||Despite stringent action and surveillance, the Calicut International Airport has continued to be a conduit for smuggling gold even during the COVID-19-imposed flight restrictions. Sources said that the latest incident involving the Ramanattukara accident and the seizures of gold at the airport revealed that Dubai -based syndicates operated the intricate gold smuggling ring through a network across north Kerala. Gold smugglers with well-trenched moles get political patronage as well. "And this is not an unknown secret. Significantly smuggling syndicates have been operating in Mangalore and Kannur airports," officials said. On Monday, the Air Intelligence Unit of the Customs had seized 2.33 kg of gold worth Rs. 1.11 crore from Muhammad Shafeeque Melethil of Moorkkanad in Malappuram district. The gold was concealed inside a new coffee maker machine. Incidentally, the Customs officers, along with officials of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, had also made two seizures of gold weighing 4.8 kg and 2.47 kg totally worth Rs. 2.95 crore on Sunday. Nearly 138 kgs of gold was seized and 287 cases were registered in 2020. This year till June 15, the gold seized was 80 kg. About 60 cases were registered in connection with these seizures. As per rules, a passenger would be arrested if the value of the gold kept in possession was above Rs. 20 lakh, officials said. The sources said that the smuggling of gold thrived whether the policies on import duties changed or not. In 2019, the Centre raised import duty on gold to 12.55% from 10% but in February this year, the import duty was slashed to 7.5 % but imposed a 2.5 % cess that would effectively attract 10.75% tax. "Even then, a profit of Rs. 4.5-5 lakh can be made for a kg of gold smuggled into the country,” the sources said. Racketeers engage carriers individually or those flying in groups to smuggle gold. It is revealed that agents or carriers employ innovative methods to bring in contraband from abroad. “About 60% of the gold seized are in compound form,” an official said. From hiding the gold in specially designed clothes to tampered electronic devices, cutlery and footwear, carriers now resort to concealing gold pieces inside the rectum. To slip by Customs, carriers use the green channel and take drugs to circumvent visible symptoms when concealing the gold inside the rectum. Usually, eyes can become swollen and cause redness due to this, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/gold-smuggling-thrives-through-calicut-airport/article34959391.ece

This had become a vital cog in accreditation process of colleges, he said while inaugurating an online symposium on the National Assessment and Accreditation Council-accreditation process organised by the Loyola College of Social Sciences here on Thursday. Besides emphasising the role of technology-enhanced digital learning in the context of accreditation, Mr. Gurukkal said the accreditation process would hinge on the extent of networking within the campus as well as the use of customised, open-source learning management systems such as MOODLE. Higher education institutions should strive to transform themselves as entrepreneurial institutions with automated systems for recording student-teacher activities. ‘Be innovative’ The academician urged teachers to be mavericks who adopted an innovative and creative attitude towards technological advancements in pedagogy, even while striving to preserve quality. The programme felicitated Rajagiri College of Social Sciences, St. Teresa’s College (both autonomous), Nirmala College and St. Thomas College - all of which got the A++ NAAC grading in their fourth cycle of re-accreditation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/technology-key-to-accreditation-gurukkal/article34959460.ece

Remains of high-capacity explosives were found during search by Forensic Department officials at the blast site. Earlier, it was suspected that detonators used for fishing in the pond in the abandoned quarry had caused the blast. Fish farming is done in the pond. Since the quarry owners have units at Chelakkara in Thrissur, officials are investigating whether the explosives had been kept for use in those quarries. The Crime Branch team led by Assistant Commissioner of Police P. Sasikumar visited the blast site. It is investigating how high-capacity explosives reached the quarry, which had been abandoned. It is learnt that the licence of the quarry had expired in 2018. The probe team will check whether illegal quarrying was done there. Meanwhile, the special team took statements of two of the injured.

Vehicles used by many of such sightseers have been impounded by squads. According to the Kozhikode Rural Police, many of those who were booked for the offence were unaware of the regulations. For them, the easing of lockdown regulations is seemingly a green signal for merriments in public places, the police said. Personnel from the Thamarassery police station said they were surprised to find as many as 18 motorbikes near a hill tourism destination at Amarad near Kattippara recently. Though the riders fled on seeing checking squads, all the vehicles were impounded and taken to the police station, they added. The unguarded eco-tourism spots at Vilangad and Nadapuram are also seeing an unhealthy rush of visitors. A number of unchecked interior roads turn safe routes for them. Since local tourism entrepreneurs are out of business following the COVID-19 outbreak, local vigil is on the decline. Station House Officers from rural stations said they had alerted the Tourism Department and local administrators to adopt stringent measures to discourage the trend. They made it clear that local people’s support would be sought to gather information about trespassers. A local body member from Nadapuram said there were incidents in which reckless sightseers were trapped in the middle of rivers following flash floods. “Recently, five youths had a narrow escape while bathing in the river near the Janakikadu eco-tourism spot,” he said. The Valayam police said the Thirikakkayam waterfalls near Vilangad attract youngsters. Over 15 persons were booked till Thursday, apart from impounding 12 vehicles, they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/police-patrol-ramped-up-as-people-throw-caution-to-wind/article34959393.ece

25 June 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||HC grants relief to Twitter India chief||In a temporary relief to Twitter India’s Managing Director Manish Maheshwari, the High Court of Karnataka on Thursday restrained the Uttar Pradesh police fromtaking any coercive action against him till June 29 on a criminal case related to the Ghaziabad incident of uploading a video related to assault on an elderly Muslim man. However, the court said the Loni Border police could question Mr. Maheshwari, who is residing in Bengaluru, through virtual mode till it decided the legal question of whether the High Court of Karnataka had the jurisdiction to entertain challenge to the notice issued by the Uttar Pradesh police. Justice G. Narendar passed the interim order on a petition filed by Mr. Maheshwari questioning the notice by the Loni Border police on June 18 asking him to join the investigation after he replied to their earlier notice indicating that he was prepared to cooperate with the investigation through videoconference. Earlier, Senior Advocate C.V. Nagesh had contended that Mr. Maheshwari was only an employee of Twitter Communications India Pvt Ltd., looking after marketing and sales and had nothing to do with the process of uploading of content, as it was controlled by Twitter Inc, U.S. It was also contended that though Mr. Maheshwari had been designated as Managing Director, he was neither the director nor a member of the Board of Directors as per the Companies Act, 2013, for holding him responsible on behalf of the company, which had been made as an accused in the First information Report. Mr. Nagesh pointed out that the Uttar Pradesh police on June 17 issued notice through email under Section 160 of Code of Criminal Procedure, which in law meant that they wanted his statement as a witness. Mr. Maheshwari on June 18 replied that he would be available to record statement through virtual mode. On June 21, Mr. Nagesh said, the Uttar Pradesh police issued a notice through e-mail under Section 41A of the Cr.PC, which meant that the police were now treating Mr. Maheshwari as an accused. It was also pointed out to the court that Mr. Maheshwari had not been arraigned as an accused individually in the FIR. Not allowing him to appear through virtual mode during the current situation was contrary to the apex court’s directions, Mr. Nagesh contended. However, advocate P. Prasanna Kumar, appearing for the Uttar Pradesh police, raised a preliminary objection stating that the petitioner could not invoke the jurisdiction of the High Court of Karnataka in view of Article 226(2) of the Constitution. Though the petitioner claimed to be a resident of Bengaluru city, in the email notice issued to him, the Uttar Pradesh police had mentioned his address as Mumbai, the counsel for Uttar Pradesh police said.  Six individuals, including journalists, Twitter, the news website The Wire, were among the nine accused named in the FIR by the Loni Border police over uploading and circulation of a video in which the elderly man, Abdul Shamad Saifi, claimed that he was allegedly thrashed by some young men after compelling him to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’ . The police claimed that the video was shared to cause communal unrest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hc-grants-relief-to-twitter-india-chief/article34959105.ece

It’s necessary to ascertain whether or not there are any violations of NGT directions as being pointed out by Telangana repeatedly,” a senior official of the river board told The Hindu . In a letter addressed to the Secretary of Water Resources Department of AP a couple of days back, member of the river board H.K. Meena has drawn Andhra Pradesh’s attention to a recent letter written to it by Telangana in the matter and attached a copy of it along with a few pictures on the work reportedly being done at the RLIS site on the foreshores of Srisailam reservoir in Kurnool district. The KRMB member said in order to implement the directions of NGT, the board had constituted a team to visit the site of the proposed RLIS. “Accordingly, the team leader and member of the board had requested Andhra Pradesh government several times to nominate a nodal officer and facilitate the visit of the team to the project site.” However, the board pointed out that Andhra Pradesh government has not facilitated the visit of the team to the project site so far “citing various reasons.” The board directed Andhra Pradesh government one more time not to take up construction of the project until the detailed project report (DPR) is submitted and appraised by the KRMB and the Central Water Commission (CWC) -- and sanctioned by the Apex Council.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/krmb-faults-state-for-not-facilitating-visit-to-rlis-site/article34959574.ece

Josephine on Thursday issued a statement expressing remorse over her comment in a channel programme that drew widespread criticism. The video clip of a seemingly annoyed Ms. Josephine snapping at a victim of domestic violence and asking her to “suffer” if she could not file a police complaint had created much resentment, with many demanding her resignation. Her rude remark to a distressed woman, who seemed a little hesitant to open up, also generated a volley of trolls on social media. When the woman said she was being abused by her husband and her mother-in-law, the chairperson asked if she had approached the police. The Ernakulam resident revealed she had not shared it with anyone and Ms. Josephine retorted with a curt “then you suffer.” Many prominent persons termed her behaviour arrogant and demanded a more humane person as her replacement. Ms. Josephine said that her hard tone was due to the issues in audio quality and she had only taken a mother’s freedom with the woman. “It was my self-indignation over girls failing to come forward bravely with complaints, but on second thoughts I felt I could have avoided that comment.

She said that she was clueless about the format of the programme. “I had tried to avoid that programme due to my busy schedule and health issues. I decided to go when they told me my response was necessary and the subject was dowry-related. Only after reaching there, I came to know that it was a call-in programme,” she said.

25 June 2021||NEW DELHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||SC refuses to intervene in Kerala students’ plea||The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to intervene in a petition filed by students to cancel Class 11 exams in Kerala due to the pandemic and evaluate marks via an internal assessment scheme. A Bench of Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari gave the students liberty to approach the Kerala High Court with their plea. Advocate G. Prakash, for Kerala, said Class 11 exams were scheduled in September. The marks were not relevant for college admissions in 2021. They would only be considered in 2022, when they are combined with the Class 12 marks. Mr. Prakash said Kerala had already conducted the Class 12 examinations in April. Advocate Prashant Padmanabhan, appearing for the students, said holding Class 11 exams in September as planned or later depending on the COVID-19 situation would put students under unnecessary pressure. It would interfere with their studies and preparation for the Class 12 exams, which would start from March 2022. The court, at this point, asked Kerala whether they would give students time — 15 days to a month — to prepare for their Class 11 exams. Mr. Prakash orally said the State would be willing to do so. However, Mr. Padmanabhan said students would need at least three months to prepare. But the court finally decided not to intervene, saying it had wanted to help but would not like to delve into the issue of Class 11 exams any further.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sc-refuses-to-intervene-in-kerala-students-plea/article34959103.ece
25 June 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Tobacco farmers urged to go for farm mechanisation||Adapting to the new normal during the COVID-19 times, the farmers should go in for farm mechanisation in a big way as part of cost cutting and adopt best agronomic practices to stay afloat, according to Tobacco Board chairman Y. Raghunatha Babu. Taking part in ‘Eurvaka Pournami’ festival organised by the growers coming under the Ongole II auction platform, he exhorted the progressive farmers to take the lead in adopting innovative farm techniques and spreading them among fellow farmers.

He symbolically tilled a piece of land and patted, among others, farmer leaders V.V. Prasad, Pothula Narasimha Rao and P. Bhadri Reddy for organising the traditional cultural practice to mark the commencement of kharif cultivation. Tobacco Board Executive Director A. Sridhar Babu noted that the market prices for the bright and medium grade varieties were up to the mark, and promised to take up with the traders the growers’ demand for better price for the low-grade varieties. Tobacco Board Vice-Chairman G. Konda Reddy said it was the right time to grow green manure crops. Southern Black Soil regional manager B. Manjunath observed that overnight rains augured well for the farmers to start cultivation. SLS regional manager D.

Leading the protest, Prakasam District Congress Committee (DCC) president Eda Sudhakar Reddy said instead of providing all the BPL families Rs. 7,500 per month as suggested by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to tide over the COVID-induced economic crisis, the BJ-led NDA government at the Centre made their lives miserable. “All sections of the society are reeling under the impact of recurrent increases of fuel prices which has crossed the Rs. 100-mark,” he lamented and demanded that the Centre and State governments immediately reduce the taxes on fuel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cong-holds-protest-against-fuel-price-hike/article34959570.ece

Ranga Rao while leading a protest here on Thursday. “The past seven months during which 520 protesting farmers have died reminds us the period of the Emergency 46 years ago,” he added. During the coronavirus pandemic, while the other sectors slumped, farmers risked their lives and achieved a record farm production, All India Kisan Sabha district secretary Vadde Hanuma Reddy pointed out, adding that the Centre had forced the three farm laws upon the farmers which would be taken away farming from their hands, only to be handed over to coroporates. Farmers’ suicide Referring to the spate of farmer’ suicides, Andhra Pradesh Rythu Sangam district president P. Hanumantha Rao said more than 4 lakh farmers were forced to end their lives owing to mounting debts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/farmers-to-observe-black-day-tomorrow/article34959568.ece
25 June 2021||RAJAMAHENDRAVARAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Six airports in A.P. may be privatised, says MP||Member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism, and Culture Margani Bharat on Thursday stated that the proposed Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (Amendment) Bill, 2021, was primarily intended to privatise the loss-making airports under the Airports Authority of India (AAI). Speaking at the meeting chaired by Standing Committee Chairman and MP T.G. Venkatesh in New Delhi, Mr. Bharat said, “The airports, including Vijayawada and Tirupati, will be privatised with the amendment. How can these two airports be privatised after investing nearly Rs. 950 crore on their modernisation and expansion?” “The amendment will enable privatisation of six loss-making airports in Andhra Pradesh by handing them over to the private players either through bunching or pairing after the Bill becomes an Act,” Mr. Bharat, who is Rajamahendravaram MP, said. “In Gujarat, nine airports, including the ones at Surat, Vadodara, and Rajkot, have reported losses. I do not think that there will be any move to privatise these airports. Strengthening the AAI appears to be a robust solution to register better results,” said Mr. Bharat. He further said that the Bill was against the guidelines of NITI Aayog, which mandates that not more than two airports should be given to the private developer in any State. “The idea of bundling the airports and handing them over to the private players will also be against the existing policies of the AAI and the Government of India,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/six-airports-in-ap-may-be-privatised-says-mp/article34959577.ece

25 June 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||CBI opens criminal inquiry in ISRO frame-up case||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has opened a criminal inquiry against a set of former law enforcement officials responsible for the police frame-up that led to the wrongful arrest, custodial torture and unjustified incarceration of Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) scientist Nambi Narayanan and others in 1994. Last month, the CBI had filed a First Information Report (FIR) marked as classified in the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate (Thiruvananthapuram) R. Rekha.  The FIR named Siby Mathews, who then headed the “ISRO Spy Case” Special Investigation Team (SIT), his deputies K.K. Joshua, and S. Vijayan and Thampi S. Durgadutt, and the then Deputy Director, Intelligence Bureau, R.B. Sreekumar as accused in the case initiated by the Supreme Court. The accused are now retired. SC order The Supreme Court (SC) had in 2018 ordered the Kerala government to pay Mr. Narayanan a compensation of Rs. 50 lakh for ruining his life and reputation. The apex court had also constituted a three-member committee under jurist D. K. Jain to identify those responsible for the wrongful incarceration of Mr. Narayanan. In April, the Union government requested the apex court to take cognisance of the Jain committee report and initiate suitable action. Consequently, it forwarded the judicial panel’s findings to the CBI stating that they were grave and merited a thorough investigation. The case The controversial page in the history of the police investigation and criminal prosecution in Kerala commenced with the arrest of two Maldivian women on the charge of overstay and infringement of the Official Secrets Act in Thiruvananthapuram in November 1994. Soon, the police arrested two ISRO scientists, Mr. Narayanan and D. Sasikumaran, along with two others. The Kerala Police claimed that the women were spies of a foreign power. They alleged that the foreign agents had entrapped the scientists into parting with secret space technology. The CBI took over the case in December 1994. It closed the case for want of evidence. The SC upheld the closure report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cbi-opens-criminal-inquiry-in-isro-frame-up-case/article34959112.ece

25 June 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Group-I Mains: APPSC member denies irregularities in selection of candidates||The selection of candidates in Group-I Mains examination was done in a transparent way, scrupulously following the rule book, said Shaik Salam Babu, member of the Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission (APPSC), here on Thursday. Addressing the media, Mr. Salam Babu dismissed as baseless the allegations of irregularities in the process being made against the APPSC, and said they only brought disrepute to the credibility of the commission. Referring to the allegation that 70 candidates had been selected under sports quota, he said there was no truth in it. Candidates of all the categories were given equal opportunities and the choice of language. He said the candidates were asked to upload their sports certificates, and first priority was given to a gold medal in the Olympics. The certificates were then ratified by the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh (SAAP). Speaking about the alleged exchange of booklets by the candidates at the examination centres in places such as Kakinada and Srikakulam, the commission member sought to clarify that as per the norms, damaged booklets were replaced with the buffer booklets. There was also no truth in reports that there were loopholes in digital valuation of the papers, Mr. Babu said, informing that the commission had closely studied the various aspects of digital valuation being followed in other States for two months and only after it was convinced that it was a fool-proof system, it decided to go ahead and implement it in the State. Replying to a query, Mr. Babu said the commission had discretionary powers to change the ratio of the selection of candidates. He said the result would always depend on the candidates’ efficiency and the exam pattern. “There have been cases of candidates who could not succeed in Group-III, but who cracked the Group-I exam and vice-versa,” he added. “The commission has been functioning in a most transparent way and it will always be ready to clarify doubts, if any. However, the norms do not allow revaluation of answer sheets,” he clarified. Job calendar Referring to the demand that the number of posts be increased in the job calendar released recently, Mr. Babu said since the commission did not have the power to do it, it had taken the issue to the notice of the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/group-i-mains-appsc-member-denies-irregularities-in-selection-of-candidates/article34959582.ece
25 June 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Five-member gang, which killed six senior citizens, arrested||The Penamaluru police arrested a five-member gang, which allegedly murdered six persons, and looted their houses. The accused reportedly planned the murders during the pandemic, as the victims’ family members would not get any doubt on their deaths. The police had picked up two persons as part of investigation into a case of attempt to loot an ATM at Poranki Centre. Based on the confessions of the suspects, they took into custody three more persons and during questioning, the accused reportedly confessed to the killings. The arrested were identified as V. Prabhu Kumar, S. Gopi Raju, P, Chakravarthy and M. Naga Durga Rao, all auto drivers, and M. Phaneendra Kumar, a painter. They allegedly murdered, Nalini (58), Seeta Mahalakshmi (63) of Poranki in October and November last year. They also allegedly killed a couple Nageswara Rao (85) and Prameela Rani (75) of Kanchikacherla in Krishna district in December. The accused allegedly killed Dhanalakshmi (58) of Tadigadapa in January this year, and Papamma on the city outskirts a few days ago, said Police Commissioner B. Srinivasulu at a press conference on Thursday. Modus operandi The modus operandi of the gang was to conduct ‘recce’ during day time, identify senior citizens and kill them during night. The gang reportedly entered the houses by opening the latches from outside, killed the victims by smothering them and escaped with gold and cash, Mr. Srinivasulu said. “Of the total six murders, only one case has been registered with the police and in other incidents their family members did not lodge complaints assuming that they died of COVID-19,” said Central Zone Assistant Commissioner of Police Y. Srinivas Reddy. “The gang conducted ‘recce’ in Tenali and Mangalagiri in Guntur district and in Vuyyuru, Kankipadu and Penamaluru on Vijayawada outskirts and planned to kill 12 more persons and loot their houses. Had the gang is not arrested now, they would have executed their plans,” said Penamaluru CI M. Satyanarayana. Besides, the gang allegedly committed thefts in many houses in the last 10 months. Taking advantage of COVID and curfew, the gang planned the killings, said Deputy Commissioner of Police-2 (Law and Order) Vikrant Patil.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/five-member-gang-which-killed-six-senior-citizens-arrested/article34959139.ece

25 June 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Power to regulate minor ports should be with the States, asserts Mekapati||Industries and Commerce Minister Mekapati Goutham Reddy has suggested that the States’ Maritime Boards should be vested with the powers of a Maritime Port Regulatory Authority (MPRA) as in the case of major ports. Participating in the Maritime States’ Development Council meeting held virtually on Thursday, he pointed out that the draft Indian Ports Bill, 2020, provides for the constitution of a single MPRA for all the minor ports, whereas there were 13 regulatory authorities for as many major ports under the Major Ports Regulatory Authority Act, 2020. “This is discriminatory,” he stated. Mr. Goutham Reddy said the legal department of Government of Andhra Pradesh was still reviewing the Bill, and that the regulation of minor ports could not be done by the Centre. The power to regulate the minor ports should be with the States as the subject fell in the Concurrent List. ‘Exempt existing facilities’ If the Central government intended to proceed to enact the Bill in spite of the objections raised by the States, it should consider exempting the existing operational ports and the ports under construction in the maritime States, Mr. Goutham Reddy appealed. The Minister further said that A.P. was developing three ports at Bhavanapadu, Machilipatnam and Ramayapatnam to realise the State’s potential for growth in the maritime sector. Besides, emphasis was laid on the development of the fisheries sector in which A.P. was ranked first in the country with a 24% share in the national production. A.P. contributes 1.61% of the global production. He said A.P. was looking forward to better road and rail connectivity to the seaports at Gangavaram, Krishnapatnam and Kakinada, and it was thankful to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways for sanctioning 32 road projects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/power-to-regulate-minor-ports-should-be-with-the-states-asserts-mekapati/article34959588.ece

Endowments Minister Velampalli Srinivas Rao, on Thursday, said the parishad was asked to take necessary steps and resolve the issue at the earliest. Further, the parishad was asked to convene a meeting with seers and pontiffs to look into the matter and suggest a way out, he said. Endowments Department special commissioner and member secretary of the parishad P. Arjun Rao issued orders in this regard. After the erstwhile pontiff of the mutt Sri Veerabhoga Vasanta Venkateswara Swamy passed away last month, a dispute arose over his successor. It was said that the erstwhile pontiff had chosen his successor and wrote a will. But trouble broke out as the families of his first and second wives wanted a person from their respective lineage to be declared as the next successor of the mutt. Some Hindu spiritual leaders tried to resolve the deadlock amicably but in vain as both families refused to concede and held on to their respective demands.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jc-to-oversee-process-to-select-mutt-pontiff/article34959146.ece

25 June 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Centre’s five oxygen plants functional in A.P., HC told||The State government informed the Andhra Pradesh High Court on Thursday that the Central government had sanctioned 55 Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants to the State and five of them were functional at present. Seventeen other PSA plants were in various stages of establishment. Submitting to the court a memo having details of the COVID-19 containment measures, the government said while the Centre would take care of the civil works and equipment, the electrical, generator and connection works were to be taken up by the State. Of the more than 17 sites identified, the State was yet to receive the PSA plants from the Centre for 12 locations. In the remaining five sites, plants had been received and the State was completing the other works. Regarding Mucormycosis (black fungus) cases, the government apprised the court that their number stood at 3,087 as on Wednesday, of which 1,327 had been cured and the patients discharged. There had been 232 deaths till date and 1,528 patients were undergoing treatment for the infections. Out of them, 697 were on Amphotericin-B injections, 495 on Posaconazole injections and 802 on Posaconazole tablets.

25 June 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Black fungus won’t be fatal if diagnosed in time, say doctors||The number of mucormycosis (black fungus) cases in Visakhapatnam are growing steadily even as the COVID-19 curve is on the downward trend. There are bright chances of recovery from the fungal infection if the symptoms are diagnosed and treated early. On an average, five new cares are being reported in the city every day. Symptoms like facial pain, blurring of vision, cheek pain, changes in skin colour and loosening of teeth in patients who have recovered from COVID-19 could be an early warning sign of mucormycosis. The special ward, opened at KGH nearly a month ago and the one at ENT Hospital, opened two weeks ago. A few notified private hospitals are also treating black fungus cases. “The second variant of COVID-19 has targeted the nasal defence system besides lowering immunity in patients. In addition to this, prolonged use of steroids, uncontrolled diabetes and other pre-existing conditions lead to an abnormal rise in mucormycosis cases,” says Dr. B. Ramachandra Rao, an Associate Professor at the Government ENT Hospital. “Though other medical specialties like ophthalmology and neurosurgery are also involved, ENT surgeons play a major role in the treatment. The fungus finds easy prey in those with low immunity levels, due to long-term steroid use for treatment of COVID-19, and those with uncontrolled diabetes. When there is eye intervention, the patients are referred to the special ward in KGH, where a full-fledged team is available,” says Dr. Ramachandra Rao. The very first mucormycosis surgery at the special ward in KGH was done on May 29. The fungus entered the maxillary sinus, from there to the eye and emerged out through the skin on to the cheek. Dr. P.V. Sudhakar, plastic surgeon and principal of Andhra Medical College, led the team, which successfully performed the surgery. Dr. Bharathi (plastic surgeon), Dr. M.V. Vijayshekar (neurosurgeon), Dr. M. Veer Kumar and Dr. Sudha (ENT) and Dr. Allu Padmaja (anaesthetist) were the other team members. “So far, over 70 mucormycosis surgeries have been performed at KGH and a majority of the patients responded well to the treatment. Some patients were brought to the Casualty ward with gasping and in such acute cases, fatalities are higher. Some patients are referred to KGH, after surgery at private hospitals, as those hospitals do not have adequate supply of antifungal drugs,” Dr. Vijayshekar says. Amphotericin-B costs Rs. 7,000 a vial and a patient has to be given six injections a day. Posaconazole costs Rs. 600 for each tablet and a patient has to be given three tablets a day. All these are being given free of cost at KGH,” says Dr. Vijayshekar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/black-fungus-wont-be-fatal-if-diagnosed-in-time-say-doctors/article34959592.ece
25 June 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Many tribal families wrongfully denied ration card in five ITDA limits: study||Gangulamma, a resident of Pinalovasingi in Luvasingi panchayat of G. Madugula mandal in the Visakhapatnam Agency, is a senior citizen and physically challenged too, as she lost both her legs during her childhood. She has no Aadhaar card, and hence not entitled for ration card, pension or, for that matter, any social welfare benefit. Her hamlet has considerable presence of the banned CPI (Maoist) and is not connected by any form of road. Arduous task To obtain an Aadhaar card, the residents of Pinalovasingi have to trek up two hills, cross a crocodile-infested stream to reach Balapam, and then travel 80-km to the nearest Aadhaar centre in Paderu. Given her age and physical condition, Gangulamma has to be carried all the way to the Aadhaar centre, a journey she cannot endure. The case of Vantala Balanna, a member of the Kondh tribe, a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG), is different. He has been denied ration card as he has failed the six-step validation process, one of which shows that he owns a four-wheeler. Balanna hails from a hamlet, an interior area of Paderu, that is not connected by any form of road. The village volunteers and other residents of the hamlet testify that he does not own a four-wheeler. “To correct the anomaly, Balanna has to go to the Road Transport Department in Visakhapatnam city, which is a Herculean task for him given his financial status,” say the village secretariat staff. These instances have come to light in a survey conducted by a team of LibTech India, a non-profit organisation, in the five ITDA limits of North Coastal Andhra Pradesh. The survey has come to the conclusion that many tribal families, ranging from 7,000 to 35,000, may have been wrongfully denied ration cards in these ITDAs, mainly due to the anomalies in the validation process. Glaring mismatch As per the Nava Sakham Survey of the State government, in the 28 tribal mandals across the five ITDAs, the number of families enumerated is around 3.86 lakh, but the number of ration cards issued is around 3.5 lakh, which indicates that more than 35,000 families have been excluded, says Chakradhar of LibTech India. Moreover, as per the 2019 database, the number of ration cards as on December 2019 in the mandals was 3.68 lakh. In March 2021, the number dipped to 3.6 lakh. “That is why, we can say that about 7,000 to 35,000 tribal families may have been wrongfully denied ration cards,” says Mr. Chakradhar. The LibTech team has interviewed over 50 village volunteers, digital assistants and CSO workers, who have confirmed the anomaly in the validation process. “The six-step process is cumbersome for the innocent and uneducated tribal people. It has to be disbanded in the tribal areas. Instead, the village volunteers may be asked to identify the families that do not have ration cards and issue the same to them as many still do not have access to Aadhaar,” says Mr. Chakradhar. According to him, in many tribal homes, two or more families live together, but only one ration card is provided, which does not serve the purpose. Timely help “Providing ration to the families excluded will not burden the State exchequer much. It should be considered at least for the next six months till the COVID-19 pandemic subsides,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/many-tribal-families-wrongfully-denied-ration-card-in-five-itda-limits-study/article34959575.ece

25 June 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Imerys launches sales from city||Imerys, a company that specialises in providing mineral-based specialty solutions to industries, announced the commencement of commercial sales of its new Calcium Aluminate plant, here on Thursday. It was commissioned remotely from Lyon, France. Imerys has invested Rs. 350 crore to set up the plant in Visakhapatnam and employs around 100 local, who have been trained in operation of the plant. The setting up of the plant will enable the company to serve domestic customers with products adapted to their local needs.

The new plant will supply to the refractory as well as the construction market with SECAR 70V, a calcium aluminate binder with controlled chemistry and optimised mineralogy for conventional castable applications, and SECAR 68V, a calcium aluminate binder dedicated to growing demand in low-cement castables. These products have been developed by Imerys scientists to meet the specific needs of the Indian refractory and construction industries and adapted to the climate of the sub-continent. The plant will also serve as a distribution centre of imported ready-to-use mortars and bentonite solutions to serve the fast-growing infrastructure sector. The city was chosen due to its access to the port. Imerys India today employs around 800 people, located in 16 industrial sites and eight sales offices. In addition to the production of calcium aluminate binders, the Group produces specialty solutions for ceramics, plastics, polymers and refractory products. “The opening of this new plant is a major milestone for Imerys. It is another proof that the Group continues to invest in growing markets and geographies, said Alessandro Dazza, Imerys Chief Executive Officer. Imerys, an MNC, deals with mineral-based specialty solutions for industry, with 3.8 billion Euro revenue and has around 16,400 employees globally.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/imerys-launches-sales-from-city/article34959600.ece

25 June 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Long stretches of roads are still in disrepair||As the monsoon sets in, long stretches of roads are still in a state of disrepair in Hyderabad affecting traffic flow and creating potential danger zones during heavy rains. Traffic is reduced to a crawl through the day during peak hours. The evening peak hour, with almost every establishment shutting down, is a test of patience, skill and auditory threshold. “It took me 31 minutes to deliver an order from Banjara Hills to Hyderguda, a distance of 6.5 km. Usually it takes only 12 to 14 minutes,” said Md Khaleel Baig, a food-delivery executive about the evening rush hour. “It is because of the PVNR Expressway we could reach home in 45 minutes. We are no longer able to use the Masab Tank flyover as it is packed through the day,” said another regular commuter about the traffic on the Jyothi Nagar-Rythu Bazaar stretch of road. Even at 7.15 on Thursday evening, large stretches of roads were in the red on real time online traffic maps. Near Raidurgam police station, it is the electricity department that has dug up a trench creating a block to traffic flowing towards Biodiversity Junction. Below the PVNR Expressway there is a gas pipeline company that has dug up trenches to lay a pipeline. The work had been going on from the beginning of summer and shows no end in sight. At Toli Chowki near Sabza Colony, the location of annual flooding in the western part of Hyderabad, the road has been dug up on one side for drinking water pipeline. “This drinking water pipeline work will get done in three days,” says the supervisor at the site near Toli Chowki about the 1400-mm pipeline. The work has been going on for the past few weeks and before that, box girders were laid by another utility. In Nalanda Nagar, the road has been dug up for laying a sewerage line. In Banjara Hills, near a well-known mall, work is in full swing on a foot-over-bridge. While the FOB might become very useful in future, currently motorists can see the massive crater that has been there for the past two months. Beside the Biodiversity Junction flyover, sewage flows on the road. What is likely to happen once it rains is easy to figure out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/long-stretches-of-roads-are-still-in-disrepair/article34959376.ece

25 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Fathullaguda waste plant launch today||City’s second treatment and processing plant for recycling of construction and demolition waste is all ready for inauguration at Fathullaguda of Nagole on Friday. Minister for Municipal Administration & Urban Development K.T.Rama Rao will launch the plant at an event presided by the Mayor Gadwal Vijayalakshmi amid a posse of other colleagues and dignitaries. The first such plant had already been launched by the Minister at Jeedimetla last November. It earned fame as the biggest C&D waste treatment plant in South India and fifth biggest in the whole country, GHMC claimed through a press statement. Other than Hyderabad, C&D waste treatment plants exist in New Delhi, Ahmedabad, Surat and Visakhapatnam The plant at Fathullaguda is equipped to treat 500 metric tonnes of debris per day. Thanks to the use of wet processing technology, the plant will not emanate any dust or pollutants, the note said. C&D waste can be used in its raw form as low level filling, and sub-base for road construction. Further processing of the debris could yield products such as sand, recycled bricks, paver blocks, parking tiles and footpath tiles. Construction debris to the tune of 13.35 lakh metric tonnes has been collected and dumped near Jeedimetla plant since April, 2018, while the Fathullaguda plant already has 7.97 lakh metric tonnes of accumulated waste for processing. It is estimated that the city generates over 2,000 tonnes of C&D waste per day, which was earlier being dumped recklessly on the roadside and in lakes. GHMC has organised special vehicles to collect such waste upon payment of Rs. 342 per metric tonne, so that it can be scientifically disposed of at the treatment plants, the note said. Proposals are pending for establishment of more such plants on all corners of the city, to ease the logistics. Kotwalguda of Shamshabad is one more location where another plant is being mulled.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/fathullaguda-waste-plant-launch-today/article34959377.ece

25 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Long queues due to reduced carrying capacity, says DMRC||Following long queues outside several metro stations since the resumption of services, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Thursday said that the current frequency of trains is similar to pre-pandemic times. The public transporter attributed the long queues to reduced carrying capacity of the Delhi Metro network due to government guidelines. Metro services resumed on June 7 after a hiatus of nearly a month due to the COVID-19-induced lockdown. Guidelines issued by the Delhi government stated that the metro can run only at a 50% capacity. Single-entry points DMRC spokesperson Anuj Dayal said, “The long queues are caused as only single-entry points are permitted at most of the metro stations, as in a mass transit system it is difficult to regulate the number of persons inside the system once entry is permitted. At present, the carrying capacity of the Delhi Metro as per existing guidelines is in the range of 10%-15% only.” The DMRC also said that 5,100 train trips were being run every day with a frequency of 2.5 minutes to 5 minutes on all major corridors. “This was the same frequency at which metro was operating during the normal pre-COVID times. The metro is thus, operating and running at its full frequency or capacity but with reduced carrying capacity owing to restrictions,” it said. According to government guidelines, passengers are required to sit on alternate seats and are not permitted to stand inside the metro coaches. The restrictions have resulted in each coach carrying approximately 25 passengers as opposed to the 300 it could accommodate without restrictions.  The long queues are caused as only single-entry points are permitted at most of the metro stations Anuj Dayal DMRC spokesperson||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/long-queues-due-to-reduced-carrying-capacity-says-dmrc/article34959302.ece
25 June 2021||New Delhi,||HC issues notice to Centre on harassment complaint by officer||The Delhi High Court has issued notice to the Centre on a petition by a senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, who has complained of sexual harassment against the Director General of the Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D), claiming that the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) in her case was not properly constituted. Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani also issued notice to BPR&D while posting the case for further hearing on June 25. In the meantime, the High Court asked if the parties involved, being very senior officers of a uniformed force, could attempt to resolve the issue on their own. Proceedings under way The High Court’s direction came on a plea by the senior IPS officer who said proceedings in her complaint are under way before the ICC constituted by BPR&D. Senior advocate Rebecca John, representing the senior IPS officer, argued that the petition was only concerned with the constitution of the members of the ICC, which was constituted by an order of May 21, this year. ICC members Ms. John contened that members of the ICC are subordinate in rank to the Director General against whom the sexual harassment complaint has been made. This, Ms. John submitted, was in the teeth of a verdict of judgments of the High Court. She explained that an internal complaints committee must not comprise members who are subordinate in rank to the person who is subject matter of the complaintbefore such committee. “This, it is submitted, vitiates the very constitution of the ICC and all proceedings being conducted before it; and is against the principles of justice and fair play,” Ms. John argued. In the meantime, Centre’s counsel Monika Arora suggested that considering that both the complainant and the person against whom ICC proceedings are pending, are very senior officers of a uniformed force, an attempt be made to resolve the issues that have arisen. Ms. John also did not oppose the suggestion. “Accordingly, counsel may attempt resolution of the matter, if possible; and report on the next date of hearing,” JusticeBhambhani said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-issues-notice-to-centre-on-harassment-complaint-by-officer/article34959296.ece

25 June 2021||Pune,||NGT raps PMC over waste disposal in twin villages||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has come down heavily against the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) for not addressing the issue of ‘legacy waste’ at the garbage site at Uruli Devachi and Phursungi villages, around 20 km from Pune city. The principal NGT Bench at New Delhi, in an order on Wednesday, has directed the PMC to deposit Rs. 2 crore as bank guarantee in a separate account and utilise it for restoration of the environment under an action plan. The Bench was hearing a petition filed by the villagers of Uruli Devachi and Phursungi against unscientific disposal of garbage and non-implementation of NGT’s direction by the PMC. It has also directed the Secretary of the State Environment Department to monitor the compliance of a previous direction of July 11, 2020 and also assess the compensation to be recovered by the PMC for continued violations. Noted activist and lawyer Asim Sarode, representing the villagers, argued during the proceedings that the PMC is proposing a grant of permission from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board for establishing a 200 MT garbage processing plant near the twin villages. The lawyer representing the PMC said that there is no such proposal for additional garbage processing and assured through a statement that no fresh dumping of waste was taking place at the current site, which has already been bio-mined. The tribunal observed that as the PMC had already exceeded its stipulated time for clearing the site, it was liable to pay compensation for continued violation for “not clearing the legacy waste in the given time limit and in accordance with the statutory norms”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ngt-raps-pmc-over-waste-disposal-in-twin-villages/article34959324.ece
25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||The rise, fall and death of an antivirus software pioneer||Seventy-five-year-old John McAfee, the creator of the McAfee antivirus software who allegedly killed himself in a Spanish prison on Wednesday, called himself an iconoclast. His run-ins with governments saw him don the life of fugitive many a time in the final years of his life. In between all the running away, he found his political expression in the Libertarian Party, though he was unsuccessful in his attempt to be its nominee for the presidential election of 2016. He wanted to give it another shot in 2020 but pulled out eventually. “Decriminalise marijuana, bring our troops home, end the madness of our education system, reduce the size of government, hamstring the DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration), and let all people out of prison (who are there) for non-violent crimes.” McAfee said, in his 30-second introduction at the party’s presidential debate in 2016. “What we insert into our bodies or our minds is our own business,” he would go on to say. His death came hours after a court ordered his extradition back to the United States, where he is wanted for tax evasion. He was arrested last year at the Barcelona airport while he was reportedly about to board a flight to Istanbul. “The words ‘Arrested’ and ‘McAfee’ are frequently found together in the same sentence,” he once tweeted. He made his name and money in business. He was considered a pioneer in the field of security technology. His McAfee Associates, which sold anti-virus software, was started in 1987. And by 1994, two years after taking it public, he exited the company. It wouldn’t be until 2010 that Intel bought the then-avatar of this company, by which time, however, the McAfee name was starting to get controversial. Loss of wealth McAfee, it was reported, lost a lot of his wealth in the financial crisis of 2007. At that time, he had financial interests in the real estate sector. He could never replicate the success of his anti-virus software despite dabbling in many businesses — from an instant messaging platform to herbal antibiotics, from secure computer network devices to Bitcoin mining — over the years. His cryptocurrency business interest only got him more troubles from the authorities. His problems with law spanned many countries. He once ran away from Belize where authorities considered him a “person of interest” in connection with the murder of a neighbour. He was then arrested for illegally entering Guatemala. In 2019, he refused a court order that directed him to pay $25 million to the murdered neighbour’s estate. He tweeted, “I have not responded to a single one of my 37 lawsuits in the past 11 years.” On Twitter, his tryst with controversies continued — in the form of his posts on everything from masks during the time of coronavirus to the Deep State.

25 June 2021||COLOMBO,||Rajapaksa pardons 16 ‘political prisoners’||President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Thursday pardoned 94 persons, including 16 ‘political prisoners’ and one murder convict on death row, on the occasion of the ‘Poson Poya [full moon]’ day that bears religious significance, marking the arrival of Buddhism to Sri Lanka. While Tamil parties and human rights defenders welcomed the release of the suspects arrested under the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), government critics and lawyers slammed the release of former MP Duminda Silva, who was sentenced to death in 2016 for murdering a political rival. Significant start: TNA The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) welcomed the PTA detainees’ release before completion of their full jail terms. “This is a small yet significant start which we hope will soon be completed with the release of all political prisoners, including those against whom cases are still pending. Some cases have dragged for more than 10 years, with no end in sight,” TNA spokesman M.A. Sumanthiran said. Intervening in Parliament recently, Youth and Sports Minister Namal Rajapaksa, son of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, said at least 35 prisoners, including terror suspects from the years of war, had been in prisons longer than their sentences had called for, and sought justice for them. “Some of them have been in there for longer than my age [35]. No charges have been filed against them till today,” he said, highlighting what activists have, for long, cited while raising concern over arbitrary, prolonged detention enabled by the PTA. Around 100 Tamils arrested under the controversial law have been in custody for at least over a decade. While the government accuses them of being former LTTE cadres or supporters, the TNA has insisted they are “political prisoners” on the basis they allegedly committed crimes for the political objective of a separate state, a cause that ceased to exist after the civil war ended in 2009. In the last year alone, some 100 persons have been arrested under the PTA, including over “silly allegations” such as Facebook posts, Batticaloa MP Shanakiyan Rasamanickam recently told the Parliament. The year-long detention of lawyer Hejaaz Hizbullah and poet Ahnaf Jazeem under the PTA have also drawn international condemnation, including from the UN, and more recently the European Parliament, that have called for the repeal of the PTA. Murderer’s release Although the release of the 16 persons on Thursday was welcome, “the positive gesture has been marred by the President’s pardon to Duminda Silva, his close political ally who was convicted for murder,” Mr. Sumanthiran said. This is President Rajapaksa’s second pardon to a murder convict. In March 2020, he freed army man Sunil Ratnayake, who was on death row for killing eight Tamil civilians, including a five-year-old and two teenagers, during the civil war in the year 2000. The main Opposition party Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB, or United People’s Front) has called for withdrawal of the presidential pardon to the former MP, calling it a “violation” of the independence of the judiciary. Commenting on the development, the Bar Association of Sri Lanka asked on what basis the President took the decision to pardon Mr. Silva. While the President had the power and discretion to pardon, such discretion must always be “used judiciously”, and such power “must not be exercised arbitrarily and selectively,” the Association said in a statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/rajapaksa-pardons-16-political-prisoners/article34958878.ece
25 June 2021||BAngkok,||Thai activists march against government||Pro-democracy protesters took to the streets of Thailand’s capital on Thursday, marking the anniversary of the overthrow of the country’s absolute monarchy by renewing their demands that the government step down, the Constitution be amended and the monarchy become more accountable. The protesters defied a ban on large gatherings instituted to fight a coronavirus surge that shows little sign of abating. It was their first large protest after a hiatus of about three months caused by the pandemic and the jailing of protest leaders, who have since been released on bail. The government of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha is facing criticism that it botched pandemic recovery plans by failing to secure adequate vaccine supplies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/thai-activists-march-against-government/article34959052.ece

These are unmarked graves.” He said that the graves may at one time have been marked, but “Catholic Church representatives removed these headstones,” adding that doing so is a crime in Canada and they were treating the gravesites “as a crime scene”. Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations chief Bobby Cameron described the finding as “a crime against humanity”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/over-750-graves-found-at-former-canada-school/article34958874.ece

Across the densely populated metropolis, people lined up early in the morning to buy the paper, which in recent years had become an increasingly outspoken critic of Chinese and Hong Kong authorities’ efforts to limit the freedoms found here but not in mainland China. The paper was gone from newsstands by 8.30 a.m. The newspaper said it was forced to cease operations after police froze $2.3 million of its assets, searched its office and arrested five top editors and executives last week, accusing them of foreign collusion to endanger national security. The paper printed 1 million copies for its last edition — up from the usual 80,000.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/apple-daily-sells-out-final-edition/article34958876.ece
25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Can the CBSE’s plan objectively assess students of Class 12?||The CBSE has prepared a tabulation scheme to determine the marks that students of Class 12 will be awarded in this pandemic year, upon completion of schooling. How reliable is such a scheme against the backdrop of the digital divide, and can it be improved? In a conversation moderated by G. Ananthakrishnan , Anita Rampal and Uday Gaonkar discuss the road ahead for assessing students. Edited excerpts:  Were the students adequately prepared for the assessment system proposed by CBSE? Anita Rampal:I know in Delhi, for instance, students who could not even access online classes. So, for them, it’s important that CBSE is looking at assessment over a longer period, not just this pandemic year, and what marks they got in Class 10 and 11. They have yet to see how their schools are going to be marking them for their internal assessment in Class 12. I have spoken to some who did not understand much of what happened in Class 12 because they barely had a shared phone between the siblings or not even that. This has been a very challenging year. I think this was the fairest that the CBSE could have worked out at the given moment, especially since it was done very late and under court orders. You would have a different experience in a rural setting, Mr. Gaonkar. What do you think? Uday Gaonkar:I’m working in a state-run school for Classes 8 to 10. Last year, only 80-85 days of physical classes were held. Normally, the academic year should have 200 working days. The syllabus was reduced by 30%. So, that is a mismatch: school days were reduced to 50% and the syllabus cut only by 30%. We were forced to teach hurriedly. Meaningful learning involves a lot of interaction between students, teachers and the community. In this scenario, we are just forced to complete the syllabus. The Government of Karnataka tried broadcasting classes: video classes were broadcast on Doordarshan and even on YouTube, but ours is a very remote location in a rural area. Only 30% students have smartphones. Others have keypad phones. Students found it very difficult to get access to those YouTube videos. On TV and the Internet, what’s their efficacy in terms of pedagogy? AR:Very poor. For decades, we have struggled to move beyond just chalk and talk and staring at the blackboard. That itself is not pedagogy. We seem to be losing a lot of the work that we may have done in the last few decades. Learning happens through discussions with others, through engagement with activities or with the world around you. Now, asking students to stare at a screen is worse than even staring at a blackboard. This is not learning; this is just a kind of coaching. You have learnt something, but you are told that you can have a person or a machine to help you revise it. Digital coaching has been pushed relentlessly by the industry of education technology. This time they really had it big. You can see the kinds of billionaires who have come out of this industry. For at least two decades, most educators in India have tried to resist the pressures of the computer industry which said that you must have smart boards and computers in the classroom. We have said that these can only be add-ons in places where there are essential resources for actual teaching and learning; they cannot be a substitute for activities and discussions among learners. The pandemic has not only devastated the lives and livelihoods of a majority of our children, but has exacerbated divides. During a board exam, we know that children from disparate backgrounds take the exam and are marked for the same questions, irrespective of the kinds of resources, schools and teachers they’ve had. Now, this is an added layer to that divide. And this digital divide seems to be overwhelming, so much so that the government is bringing out guidelines on home learning and homeschooling, almost putting the responsibility on the learner and the family instead of the system. That is going to be damaging. When the Right to Education (RTE) law was enacted, the Ministry had appended to the Act a significant note, a justification for each of the clauses. One important justification was that if a child is not able to learn, it is not the failure of the child but of the system. Today, what is going to happen when the system is going to take responsibility for all these lapses, for the inability to connect with our students? We need to not just push the syllabus, but also emotionally support their agency, give them the confidence to continue despite all the odds, because many students are going to drop out after the pandemic is over. So, it’s not just a matter of what marks we will give them for Class 12. What can feasibly be done this year? AR:All the State Boards should make sure they’ve looked at assessments, at what students have done. I don’t like the term ‘learning loss’ because again, it puts the responsibility on the student. I think the youngest children have learned a lot. They’ve learned the difficult lessons of life, so we shouldn’t be calling it learning loss. Boards are very distant, remote entities. Schools should really make that intimate and compassionate connect. First, look at students and support them, relieve them of their traumas and anxieties, and then assess them over a longer period. Look at their Class 10, Class 11, look at all the work and projects that they may have done, or can do even now, and then assess them. Of course, if students have not had online classes at all, the school will need to take a call on that: how do they do an internal assessment? I think they will have to be empathetic, careful and fair. The RTE Act says that up to age 14, there should be continuous and comprehensive assessment, but the system never heeded that. What it did, instead, was a poor substitute, what the CBSE called continuous assessment. We need a rethinking on continuous assessment. It’s not just a mark on a paper. It is the assessment of abilities — students’ expression, writing, observation, ability to critically think and experiment. During the pandemic how can you provide instruction to students? UG:Last year, the Bharat Gyan Vigyan Samithi (BGVS), most of them teachers, started Vatar Sala, a neighbourhood school [in Karnataka]. Students here interact even during a lockdown period and because they know each other, they interact, they share one playground. We thought that one teacher or volunteer will help the students learn. One activity that we have developed is for children to collect electricity bills from their friends in their neighbourhood and transfer that data into another table for that information to be tabulated. They use that information to get various inferences, for example, per capita electricity consumption in that area. We have developed worksheets and activity sheets this year also. The system is set around one school-leaving examination. Is the situation conducive to having a standardised exam, besides entrance exams? AR:Exams meant as entrance exams are selective. You have a large number of people, you have fewer seats. But a school exam does not have to be selective. It should be a school-leaving exam based on what you have learnt right through the period or right through two years. That is much more healthy. It does not have to be standardised, which is never a very good format for children because education is really rooted in a child’s environment. The more decentralised the assessment, the more rigorous and better it is, the more it discerns what students have learned. You could have a common textbook, but the best way to assess is to be more decentralised. The RTE Act says don’t take a centralised assessment for selecting/ admitting students into school or for any other purpose. All our assessment theories tell us that better assessment is done in a trusting environment. We have statistical ways of seeing that these are not unfair, or can be moderated in ways that do not get skewed towards any particular State or district or school. CBSE has stipulated results committees in schools. Is that a sound approach, with 40% of the marking at Class 12 level? AR:It is okay to have some external component of the committee, some people who can understand assessment and who also look at fair distributions. For instance, in our university assessment for the four-year B.El.Ed teacher education programme run by many colleges under our faculty, there is a large component of internal assessment. We have a good system of moderation, where all colleges actually look at samples of work, of their highest and lowest marks, and then decide whether they fall within a fair marking distribution. If some college marking is skewed, those marks are moderated by consensus. This is a challenging process, it needs time and patience and careful rigour, which could be developed within the school system.  Mr. Gaonkar, could you tell us about your report on education reform? UG:BGVS submitted a report last year to the committee set up by the government on online classes. Our experience with Vatar Sala was very helpful. We gave some data collected by a national sample survey about Internet access and availability of devices. We said that it is injustice to have online classes for school students because it will not reach all the students, and recommended some paper-based activity sheets. Even learning kits were tried. What did you find from the survey and recommend as remedy? UG:Of the 70% of the students living in rural areas, only 6%-7% or even 2% have computers at home — laptops or computers — and only 10%-12% know how to handle the computer and Internet. Students who don’t have a mobile phone have to share the phones of their friends. Most of the students have only basic keypad mobiles, no smartphones, and more than 20% of the students don’t have a mobile phone. So, we said that is unjust. Even though Chandana television reaches more than 60%-70% students, these are PPTs (power point presentations) without any interaction. That is not learning. If conditions don’t really improve for children to go back to physical classes, what would you do for 2022? AR:We should be prepared to run schools only when there are lean periods between COVID-19 waves when it is safe. And in that time, try and maximise the time to keep them engaged, not just give them memory-based information. More importantly, we need to keep in touch with them at home. Maybe give them some handouts, worksheets. Assessment should be closely tied to learning. UG:This year is an opportunity to look into this matter differently. Board exams made the schools tuition centres. Now, we can make schools learning spaces again by providing real experiences rather than virtual experiences. Students gather knowledge in a fragmented way, whether it is language or the sciences or maths. Classes are fragmented age-wise. We can club them as far as possible and children can learn with their elders’ help. It is time to rethink school education.  Most of the students have only basic keypad mobiles, no smartphones, and more than 20% of the students don’t have a mobile phone.

25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||The rural economy can jump-start a revival||The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic could be slowly receding with a decline in the official estimates of daily infections and deaths. The economy is also very gradually getting back to normal, with many States beginning to ease some of the restrictions imposed in their lockdowns. However, the challenge of an economic recovery is far more serious than the health pandemic despite official claims of there being an economic recovery. Last month, the National Statistical Office (NSO) released the estimates of the Indian Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth for the fiscal year 2020-21. The decline in GDP, at 7.3%, was slightly better than expectation, even though this is a gross underestimate of the reality given the methodological issue of underestimation of the economic distress in the unorganised sector. Making things worse But what makes economic recovery challenging is that this decline followed three years of sharp decline in GDP even before the novel coronavirus pandemic hit the country. Economic growth had already decelerated to 4% in 2019-20, less than half from the high of 8.3% in 2016-17. Since then, the slowdown in the economy has not only made things worse as far as economic recovery is concerned but also come at a huge cost for a majority of households which have lost jobs and incomes. The pandemic has only worsened an already fragile economic situation. The sharp decline in GDP was partly a result of the trend of a slowdown in economic activity since 2016-17. But a large part of the economic outcome in the first year of the pandemic is also a result of a mishandling of the economic situation. While a strict national lockdown certainly hit economic activity last year, what made matters worse was the less than adequate response from the Government in increasing fiscal support to revive demand in the economy. Many of the grand announcements remained largely on the monetary side without the enabling policy framework to help small and medium enterprises as well as the large unorganised sector which bore the brunt of the restrictions in economic activity. Agriculture, a key driver Despite the lack of fiscal support, an important contributor to the better-than-expected economic performance was the resilience of the rural economy, particularly the agricultural sector. While rural areas were the first point of refuge for a majority of migrants who walked back thousands of kilometres from urban metropolitan areas, agriculture was the only major sector (other than electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services) which reported an increase in Gross Value Added (GVA) in 2020-21. It not only provided jobs to returning migrants but also sustained the economy in the rural areas. Agriculture has not only been the biggest saviour during the period of the pandemic but has consistently been an important driver of the economy throughout the last five years which has seen the economy slow down sharply. The average growth rate in agriculture GVA in the last five years, at 4.8%, is significantly higher than the GVA growth of the economy as a whole, at 3.6%, in the last five years.  But can the rural sector play saviour again? Unlikely, in the present context. And it will not be due to any natural calamity such as drought but a result of the neglect and policy missteps by the Government. Even though the lockdowns imposed by the State governments at the beginning of the second wave were less severe when compared to last year, they did impact the non-agricultural economy as is evident from the high frequency data for the last two months. The expectation of positive growth in this fiscal year may suggest recovery. However, given that the economy has already suffered last year, any recovery will largely be a statistical artefact driven by the low base of last year rather than a real recovery. The fact that a majority of households have already suffered job losses and income decline which are yet to regain their pre-pandemic levels suggests caution in making any inference on an economic recovery. However, even the aggregate data are unlikely to capture the actual extent of devastation in the rural areas. While this is true for even the basic estimates of death and the health catastrophe caused by the pandemic, it is even more severe in its economic impact. Similar to the official statistics which have underestimated deaths due to the pandemic in most States — as has been brought out recently in several newspapers — the economic distress in rural areas is also largely unreported and underestimated. The second wave affected rural areas disproportionately, in terms of health but also in terms of livelihoods. Many households have lost an earning member and an equally large number have spent a large sum on private health care expenditure in dealing with the infection. It will not be surprising if rural areas now witness a sharp rise in indebtedness from non-institutional sources. However, the response from the Government has not been commensurate with the scale of the pandemic in rural areas. Unlike last year, the Government has not increased the allocation this year for the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS). For the country as a whole, despite an increase in employment demand in NREGS, the person-days generated in May 2021 was only 65% when compared to May 2020. While the free food-grain scheme has been extended this year as well, it does not include pulses as was provided last year. Similarly, there has not been any cash transfer to vulnerable groups, unlike last year. Decline in jobs, income The impact of declining incomes and job losses on demand is now visible even in rural areas. While real wages have continued to decline with the latest estimates of April 2021 showing a decline in rural non-agricultural wages by 0.9% per annum in the last two years, agricultural wages continue to stagnate. One indicator of declining demand is the decline in wholesale prices of most of the agricultural commodities. Cereals and vegetables, which together account for more than half of crop output, have seen prices decline on a year-on-year basis for more than six months now. This is happening at a time when international agricultural prices are at an all-time high. Some of this is reflected in the rise in inflation in pulses and oilseeds groups, both of which are largely imported. The net result is a peculiar situation where output prices for dominant agricultural commodities in the domestic market are declining while consumer prices of essentials such as edible and pulses are contributing to rising inflation. Inflation threat Rising inflation further threatens to reduce the purchasing power of the rural economy struggling with declining incomes and job losses. This is further compounded by the shift in terms of trade against agriculture which has put agricultural incomes under strain. The rise in input prices for diesel has already contributed to rising input costs but the recent increase in fertilizer prices for most of the complex fertilizers have also added to the misery of farmers. Rising inflation in international commodity prices also threatens the rural non-farm economy. A majority of the rural non-farm sector already struggling from low demand has now seen its profit margins getting impacted due to the increase in the cost of raw material. Despite these setbacks, the rural economy including the agricultural economy continues to remain crucial for any strategy of economic revival. But for that, it will require proactive intervention from the Government to protect the rural population by speeding up vaccination. Unfortunately, so far, the rural areas have been lagging behind in the overall rate of vaccination. At the same time, rural areas will also need greater fiscal support, both in terms of direct income support to revive demand in the economy but also through various subsidies and protection from the rising inflation in input prices. This urgent intervention is not just necessary to support economic revival but also prevent another humanitarian crisis, this time as a result of economic mismanagement.

25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Staging a comeback, re-energising India’s Africa policy||Africa is considered a foreign policy priority by India. The Narendra Modi government designed a forward-looking strategy to deepen relations with African countries. Its implementation was managed quite well, with much political will invested in expanding the multi-faceted engagement. Even as the COVID-19 era began in March 2020, New Delhi took new initiatives to assist Africa through prompt despatch of medicines and later vaccines. But now the policy implementation needs a critical review. The macro picture The latest economic data confirms what was apprehended by experts: India-Africa trade is on a decline. According to the Confederation of Indian Industry, in 2020-21, India’s exports to and imports from Africa stood, respectively, at $27.7 billion and $28.2 billion, a reduction of 4.4% and 25% over the previous year. Thus, bilateral trade valued at $55.9 billion in 2020-21, fell by $10.8 billion compared to 2019-20, and $15.5 billion compared to the peak year of 2014-15. India’s investments in Africa too saw a decrease from $3.2 billion in 2019-20 to $2.9 billion in 2020-21. Total investments over 25 years, from April 1996 to March 2021, are now just $70.7 billion, which is about one-third of China’s investment in Africa. COVID-19 has caused an adverse impact on the Indian and African economies. India’s top five markets today are South Africa, Nigeria, Egypt, Kenya and Togo. The countries from which India imports the most are South Africa, Nigeria, Egypt, Angola and Guinea. India’s top three exports to Africa are mineral fuels and oils (processed petroleum products), pharmaceutical products and vehicles. Mineral fuels and oils, (essentially crude oil) and pearls, precious or semi-precious stones are the top two imports accounting for over 77% of our imports from Africa. The composition of the India-Africa trade has not changed much over the two decades. Global competition These latest trends in bilateral economic relations should be assessed against two broad developments. First, COVID-19 has brought misery to Africa. As on June 24, 2021, Africa registered 5.2 million infections and 1,37,855 deaths. Given Africa’s population (1.3 billion) and what happened elsewhere (the United States, Europe and India), these figures may not have drawn international attention, but Africans have been deeply affected and remain ill-equipped. A recent World Health Organization survey revealed that 41 African countries had fewer than 2,000 working ventilators among them. Despite these shortcomings, Africa has not done so badly. Experts suggest that the strength of community networks and the continuing relevance of extended family play an important supportive role. Besides, Africa has some of the protocols in place, having recently suffered from Ebola, and managed it reasonably well. Sadly though, with much of the world caught up in coping with the novel coronavirus pandemic’s ill effects, flows of assistance and investment to Africa have decreased. Second, as a recent Gateway House study, Engagement of External Powers in Africa; Takeaways for India (https://bit.ly/3qoI4kv and https://bit.ly/3xOfFXE), showed, Africa experienced a sharpened international competition, known as ‘the third scramble’, in the first two decades of the 21st century. A dozen nations from the Americas, Europe and Asia have striven to assist Africa in resolving the continent’s political and social challenges and, in turn, to benefit from Africa’s markets, minerals, hydrocarbons and oceanic resources, and thereby to expand their geopolitical influence. A mix of competition and contestation involving traditional and new players, especially the United States, the European Union (EU), China, Japan and India, has attracted much attention from governments, media and academia. While China has successfully used the pandemic to expand its footprint by increasing the outflow of its vaccines, unfortunately India’s ‘vax diplomacy’ has suffered a setback. This came in the wake of the debilitating second wave of COVID-19 in the country and the shortage of vaccine raw materials from the U.S. Geopolitical tensions in Asia and the imperative to consolidate its position in the Indo-Pacific region have compelled New Delhi to concentrate on its ties with the United Kingdom, the EU, and the Quad powers, particularly the U.S. Consequently, the attention normally paid to Africa lost out. India’s role This must now change. For mutual benefit, Africa and India should remain optimally engaged. It was perhaps this motivation that shaped the substantive intervention made by External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on May 19 in the UN Security Council’s open debate on conflict and post-pandemic recovery in Africa. Touching on politico-diplomatic dimensions, he regretted that “the voice of Africa is not given its proper due” in the Security Council (https://bit.ly/3qle5Kl). He highlighted India’s role in peacekeeping in Africa, in lending support to African counter-terrorism operations, and contributing to African institutions through training and capacity-enhancing assistance. India’s aid for economic development in the African continent is set to continue, he assured. His visit to Kenya (June 12-14 ) has helped to re-establish communication with Africa at a political level. It is time to seize the opportunity and restore Africa to its primary position in India’s diplomacy and economic engagement. The third India-Africa Forum Summit was held in 2015. The fourth summit, pending since last year, should be held as soon as possible, even if in a virtual format. Fresh financial resources for grants and concessional loans to Africa must be allocated, as previous allocations stand almost fully exhausted. Without new commitments, India’s Africa policy would be like a car running on a near-empty fuel tank. Areas with promise The promotion of economic relations demands a higher priority. Industry representatives should be consulted about their grievances and challenges in the COVID-19 era. It is essential “to impart a 21st century complexion to the partnership with Africa”, as the above-mentioned study argues. This means developing and deepening collaborations in health, space and digital technologies. Finally, to overcome the China challenge in Africa, increased cooperation between India and its international allies, rates priority. The recent India-EU Summit has identified Africa as a region where a partnership-based approach will be followed (https://bit.ly/3wW1jUV). Similarly, when the first in-person summit of the Quad powers is held in Washington, a robust partnership plan for Africa should be announced. For it to be ready in time, work by Quad planners needs to begin now.

25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Protecting prisoners’ rights||The catastrophic surge in COVID-19 cases across India in April and May led to a great number of deaths (still being counted) and put an enormous strain on the healthcare system and governments. In the midst of the surge, prisoners were largely forgotten. The failure of the authorities to reduce severe overcrowding in prisons left thousands of prisoners at risk of infection and death. According to data, there are 12,715 inmates lodged in 11 sections of Tihar Jail alone as against the lodging capacity of 7,425. Out of them, 11,077 are undertrials. Violating human rights As was expected, given the poor state of prisons in India, hundreds of prisoners got infected during the pandemic and a number of them died. This vitiates a fundamental right derived from Article 21 of the Constitution. Overcrowded jails are a violation of the human rights of prisoners ( Re-Inhuman Conditions in 1382 v. State of Assam , 2018). As the court said in Charles Sobraj v. The Suptd., Central Jail, Tihar, 1978, “imprisonment does not spell farewell to fundamental rights”. The aim of imprisonment is not merely deterrence of crime but also reformation. Apart from risking the lives of inmates, ignorance of the poor conditions of prisons has also added to the misery of the families of those in jail. Since physical meetings between the inmates and family members were suspended, many families have been unaware of the conditions of their loved ones in prison. While the Supreme Court ordered that prisons adopt video conferencing technologies to overcome the lack of physical meetings, this has not been properly implemented, according to Amnesty International. A report of the organisation noted that prisoners in Jammu and Kashmir were allowed a phone call to their family only once in 15 days. In May, prominent Hurriyat leader and chairman of Tehreek-e-Hurriyat, Mohammad Ashraf Sehrai, died in detention in Jammu. Sehrai had been jailed under the Public Safety Act, a detention law that allows detention of any individual for up to two years without a trial or charge. He had tested positive for COVID-19 posthumously. His son said that Sehrai had complained of ill-health when the family had spoken to him 10 days earlier but there had been delay in his treatment till death became inevitable. Sehrai’s death has exposed the condition of prisons in Jammu and Kashmir. It has also exposed the condition of political prisoners who often languish in jail for years and are rarely convicted. Political prisoners Ever since the pandemic outbreak, human rights activists have demanded the immediate release of political prisoners on humanitarian grounds but this has fallen on deaf ears. There are several Kashmiris kept in preventive detention in jails in Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, and other parts of India. A number of them are undertrials. According to Article 14 (3)(c) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, an accused has the right to be tried without undue delay. The state is bound to provide legal assistance to prisoners, ensure their safe and timely release and safeguard their rights to a fair and speedy trial ( Hussainara Khatoon v. Home Secretary, State of Bihar, 1979). But this is not the reality for a large number of prisoners. Taking cognisance of this issue, the Supreme Court directed the States to examine releasing inmates, convicted or facing trial on non-serious charges, from jails either on regular bail or on parole. It also directed them to provide transport facility to the prisoners to reach home. It is hoped that States will comply. Some have said that they have begun reviewing prison occupancy. Given that States have started vaccinating prisoners too, the situation may improve soon. But India cannot ignore the problem of overcrowding, pandemic or no pandemic.

25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Stopping the surge||After a debilitating second wave of COVID-19, cash-strapped State governments have responded to falling cases with a swift unlock programme in most districts. Some States have opted to open the floodgates, allowing dine-in restaurants, gymnasia, most shops and religious centres in areas with low test positivity rates for the coronavirus. Lockdown-weary citizens, on their part, have greeted the reopening with road trips to tourist centres, even travelling across inter-State borders. This is not surprising, considering that the country has gone through weeks of anguish, when death and misery touched the lives of millions. The déjà vu moment, worryingly similar to the misplaced optimism following the first wave, is a time for caution and to avoid the missteps that produced the deadly second wave. Already, Maharashtra has expressed worry that there is a noticeable rise in cases in just a week; the experience of other States will soon be known. There is a lot to be concerned about, since the highly transmissible delta variant of the virus that overran cities and rural areas in April-May continues to threaten unvaccinated populations, senior citizens and people with weak immunity in particular. The likely risk for children also causes apprehension. That it has morphed into a delta plus variant through a fresh mutation underscores the need for greater vigilance. With the unprecedented knowledge base created in just over a year on COVID-19, governments have the resources to plan finely tuned reopening strategies. The current consensus on preventing spread, as WHO points out, is to avoid the three Cs — crowded places, close-contact settings and confined and enclosed spaces. The intersection of these is the most dangerous, and relaxations given by some States fall within this red zone: dine-in restaurants, cultural performances, shops, and social events in enclosed spaces. A significant number of people are unwilling to wear masks and adhere to distancing, making it difficult to stop transmission, including on trains and buses. Neither have State governments moved to provide certified masks to the public liberally, to be able to insist that they be worn. The insurance and banking sectors have made slow progress in enabling employees to work from home using real time platforms that can reduce crowding in offices. It is clear that until vaccines are freely available and cover every individual, the economy can reopen with a modicum of safety only with strong leadership. A record vaccination rate on a given day may encourage more people to come forward to be immunised, but there are not enough doses available, and data show rural areas are doing badly compared to cities even for the first dose. The Centre is cautious this time, warning of a third wave, but the imperative is to open windows of activity gradually without dropping the ball on safety.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/stopping-the-surge/article34958856.ece
25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Deserving winners||The sun, after playing hide and seek with the clouds, finally shone in all its glory at Southampton and the inaugural ICC World Test Championship summit clash had its closure on the reserve sixth day. New Zealand emerged as deserving winners with skipper Kane Williamson leading from the front through knocks of 49 and an unbeaten 52, both outings buttressed by patience and a steely resolve to counter a strong Indian bowling unit. The Black Caps won by eight wickets and Virat Kohli’s men had to draw solace from being second-best. They had to accept that the opposition was stronger in English conditions akin to New Zealand backyards unlike the tropical heat and abrasive pitches seen in India. Williamson also relished his luck at the toss and immediately elected to field with the damp weather and moist air further enhancing his pace-attack’s potency. Even while the seniors Tim Southee and Trent Boult did their nagging lines, tall Kyle Jamieson, the man-of-the-final, extracted bounce and lateral movement and shackled the tentative Indian batsmen nibbling outside the off-stump. In a Test spiced by the elements, a low-scoring slugfest was in order and once New Zealand snatched a 32-run first-innings lead and reduced India’s second dig to just 170, barring a miracle Kohli’s men were down for the count and the meagre 139-run target hardly stretched the eventual champion. India’s cricketing nostalgia is infused with the glories of ‘Indo-Pak’ rivalry, the 1983 World Cup final against the mighty West Indies or the battles against Australia right from the miracle of Eden Gardens in 2001. But it has to be admitted that matches involving India and New Zealand have also acquired a mystique of their own. In recent ICC duels, New Zealand held the edge and it continued in Southampton. During the 2019 World Cup semifinal at Manchester, New Zealand prevailed and even that face-off spilled into the reserve day. The tale back then was one of swing and dark skies and the same backdrop was present at Southampton. New Zealand has often ended up as the bridesmaid in premier tournaments but a corner was turned over the last few days and it augurs well for cricket’s health while new champions step up. India, which last won ICC silverware — the Champions Trophy — in 2013, did well in the run-up to the latest final and its rousing triumph in Australia earlier this year was the stuff of dreams. The squad has the right mix and after a break, it will be time to get back into the bio-bubble and then play the five-Test series against host England from August 4. A battle of attrition awaits India while New Zealand flies back with the champion’s halo.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/deserving-winners/article34958857.ece
25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Of Anand, simultaneous chess and the cheating controversy||Anticipation was in the air that bright October afternoon in 1987 at Pala, a bustling town in central Kerala known for its rubber plantations. Some 40 young chess players had come from across Kerala for the State junior championship. For some of us, it was our first big tournament. So, the fact that we were playing at such an event was cause for excitement. But there was another reason why we were so excited that afternoon: we were to meet Viswanathan Anand, who had recently been crowned the world junior champion in the Philippines. The State’s chess association was felicitating him. Anand had come along with his mother, who used to accompany him for tournaments those days. He also took part in an exhibition event called simultaneous display, a term that has now become familiar because of a recent controversy following an online fundraiser. In simultaneous chess, a strong player takes on several less talented opponents, ranging from 15 to 50 mostly, at the same time. There have been instances of Grandmasters playing against hundreds, too. In fact, Iran’s Ehsan Ghaem Maghami set a world record in 2011 when he took on 604 players at Tehran (for the record, he won 580 of them, drew 16 and lost eight). Usually the number is much lower. The player makes a move on one board and then goes to the next one. While the multiple participants get plenty of time, the strong player has to make his calculations quickly. But as the statistics from Maghami’s simultaneous display suggest, the Grandmaster wins most of the games. Grandmasters can defeat a large number of opponents even while playing blindfolded. At Pala, if I remember correctly, Anand won all games but two. He did, in due course, go on to win games more important than that in a career that has had few parallels in world sport. As a reporter of The Hindu , I have written on some of his finest moments over the years. I have also been privileged to interview him on several occasions, including a memorable one at his residence in Chennai three years ago. He greeted me with the same friendly smile which I first saw in Pala three decades ago. It was a pleasure listening to him talk for well over two hours. Anand is one of the greatest minds of our time. The entire chess world – and those who have come across him anywhere – would agree that he is an incredibly nice, polite, humble gentleman, on whose head sit lightly five world championships and the credit for single-handedly revolutionising chess in India. It is little wonder then everyone felt bad when news emerged earlier this month that some of Anand’s celebrity opponents had cheated, using the computer, during the simultaneous display organised by chess.com to raise funds for COVID-19 relief. It would count among Indian sport’s great fiascos. Anand didn’t deserve to be treated like that. The celebrity event featuring film stars, singers and businessmen was supposed to gain publicity for chess, which isn’t as popular in India as other sports like cricket or football. It generated publicity alright, but of the negative kind.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/of-anand-simultaneous-chess-and-the-cheating-controversy/article34958866.ece
25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||High cost of secrecy From an editorial||The U.S. government has been fighting a losing battle with the press, which has published secret official documents about the origin and escalation of the war in Vietnam. As the Government took the New York Times to court and got the publication of the documents stopped, the task of publication was taken up in turn by the Washington Post , the Chicago Sun-Times and the Boston Globe . The Government got a further jolt when some of the judges held that the newspapers did nothing seriously wrong in publishing the documents, since the consequences might be to preserve national security, rather than endanger it. Though the war in Vietnam continues and American troops are fighting there, it should be pointed that the Pentagon documents concern the decisions of past Presidents like Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson and their advisers. They do not refer to current operations, except in a historical context. Americans have recently begun to ask: “How did we get into this war? Why did we send half a million soldiers there?” The official papers have supplied the information which the public needs in order to evaluate the policies which led to deep American involmement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/high-cost-of-secrecy-from-an-editorial/article34958865.ece
25 June 2021||MUMBAI,||Reliance to invest Rs. 75,000 crore in ‘new energy’||Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) on Thursday announced plans to invest Rs. 75,000 crore in its ‘new energy’ business. RIL aims to set up four large manufacturing units involving an investment of Rs. 60,000 crore in three years at Jamnagar, Gujarat. “We have started work on developing the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex on 5,000 acres in Jamnagar,” CMD Mukesh Ambani told shareholders at the company’s 42nd annual general meeting. “It will be among the largest such integrated renewable energy manufacturing facilities in the world.” He said the four factories would make and fully integrate all ‘critical components of the new energy ecosystem’. “We will build an integrated solar photovoltaic module factory. We will build an advanced energy storage battery factory, an electrolyser factory, and for converting hydrogen into motive and stationary power, we will build a fuel cell factory,” he said. “Reliance will thus create a fully integrated, end-to-end renewables energy ecosystem,” he added. Mr. Ambani said the Jamnagar complex would offer infrastructure and utilities to make ancillary material and equipment so that all critical materials were available in time. “We will invest an additional Rs. 15,000 crore in value chain, partnerships and future technologies, including upstream and downstream industries.” ‘Affordable smartphone’ Mr. Ambani also announced that the Google and Jio teams had developed an ‘ultra-affordable’, fully featured 4G smartphone — Jiophone Next. The phone would support applications from both Google and Jio as well as from the Android PlayStore. Developed for the Indian market, the phone would be commercially available from September 10. RIL also announced that Saudi Aramco’s chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan would join the board as an independent director, adding that the RIL-Aramco deal would be formalised in 2021. In 2019, RIL had said it would sell 20% in its oil-to-chemicals unit to Saudi Aramco for $15 billion. On the partnership with Facebook, Mr. Ambani said an initial set of integrations between WhatsApp and JioMart had been introduced on a trial basis. “Our joint teams are developing the full new commerce solution linking merchants and consumers,” the RIL CMD said. The firm planned to unveil these over the next few quarters. He added that RIL had tested Jio’s 5G solutions in India and had demonstrated “speeds well in excess of 1 Gbps... we are confident of being the first to launch full-fledged 5G services.” ‘Threefold growth’ The firm’s subsidiary Reliance Retail would grow at least threefold in the next 3-5 years, he said. The unit, which aims to be among the top 10 global retailers, would create employment for more than 10 lakh people in three years, he added. Reliance Retail would continue to acquire businesses to heighten its offering, sharpen omnichannel capabilities, and drive operating efficiencies, Mr. Ambani said.

25 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Ensure GST cuts reach users’||The National Anti-Profiteering Authority (NAA) has directed GST officials across the country to ensure that the tax rate cuts notified on some COVID-19-related essentials are passed on to consumers. Complaints from end users about lack of price reductions commensurate with the tax cuts, are to be treated on a priority basis and forwarded to the State-level Screening Committees and Standing Committees on Anti-Profiteering, the NAA Secretary A.K. Goel said in a memo posted on its website on Thursday. At its last meeting on June 12, the GST Council had waived the indirect tax levied on two critical drugs, Tocilizumab and Amphotericin B, and reset the tax rate to 5% on 14 COVID-19 essentials. On June 14, the Finance Ministry had notified the revised rates, which are applicable till September 30. “The suppliers are required to commensurately reduce the prices of each of the supplies of Goods and Services made by them so that the benefit of the reduction in tax rates and/or of input tax credits is passed on to the recipients/consumers,” the NAA emphasised. Tax experts said that producers of items ranging from ambulances to pulse oximeters and oxygen concentrators would need to ensure retail price reductions were effected soon and paperwork filed to justify the extent of reductions, in order to avoid action under the anti-profiteering framework. “Businesses dealing with medical supplies that have undergone a GST rate reduction need to ensure that they have adequate documentation to demonstrate that the rate cuts have been passed on to the consumers,” said M.S. Mani, senior director at Deloitte India. Suppliers or firms who had not got the benefit of input tax credits on account of cuts in the GST rate could also file complaints, with the anti-profiteering apparatus.

25 June 2021||MUMBAI,||‘88% of SMBs yet to avail stimulus benefits’||As much as 88% of self-employed, small and micro businesses (SMB) were yet to avail any benefit under the stimulus schemes unveiled by the Centre, the findings of a survey by the Consortium of Indian Associations (CIA) and its 40 partner SMB associations show. Also, 82% of the more than 81,000 self-employed, micro/small businesses (SMBs) surveyed opined that the Union and State governments were not taking care of their interests. The respondents included manufacturers (49%), service providers (15%), self-employed (14%) besides consultants, start-ups, traders, food and hospitality units. The COVID-19 first wave and second wave “induced lockdowns over the last 15 months have severely crippled the sector, as disclosed by the findings of the report,” the CIA said in a release on Thursday. As per the findings, 73% of SMBs had not made any profit during the last fiscal and 42% were unable to decide on retention of employees; 59% said they had reduced/sacked/removed their staff compared with the pre-COVID period. ‘Pain points, solutions’ “Over the past year, CIA has provided vital suggestions on several initiatives taken by the Central and State governments for the benefit of MSMEs,” said K.E. Raghunathan, convenor, CIA. “We realised a data-backed survey would help consolidate the feedback from this sector, to bring out the pain points and provide solutions and a way forward to revive the sector, ” he added. The findings suggest the need for a three-pronged approach by exempting SMBs from statutory compliances, penal actions and litigation; protecting them from high interest burden, price wars, high cost of raw materials, losing employees, penalties, and late fees, and supporting them by giving liberal loans, clearing pending dues, offering moratorium with interest waiver and not declaring sectoral NPAs for a year. CIA proposed that the Centre amend the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006, to strengthen State facilitation councils. It also suggested collecting data on self-employed, MSME units from banks, which could help in correct classification of businesses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/88-of-smbs-yet-to-avail-stimulus-benefits/article34958839.ece

25 June 2021||PATIALA,||Last chance to punch a ticket to Tokyo||The 60th National inter-State athletics championships starting here on Friday will be the last chance for Indian athletes to book a ticket to the Tokyo Olympics and quite a few would be hoping to either attain the elusive qualificaton standard or improve their ranking. Among those aiming for automatic qualification at the five-day meet will be javelin thrower Annu Rani, who has been consistently improving over the last one year and is within sight of the 64m mark. Her personal best of 63.24m is not too far off and the reigning National champion will be hoping to go the distance this time around. Sprint showdown On the track, the much-anticipated showdown between Dutee Chand and Hima Das in the 100m and 200m sprints will be the highlight although the duo has managed to avoid it so far with either withdrawing from at least one event over the past one year. While Dutee came agonisingly close to the 100m qualifying time at the recent Grand Prix 4, she is comfortably placed in the rankings which is not the case with Hima, who has to clock 22.80s in the 200m to qualify. The spotlight will also be on the women’s 4x100m and the men’s 4x400m relay squads with the former hoping to better its National record and the latter aiming to consolidate its position in the rankings, placed precariously at 16th and final qualification spot.  Also hoping to improve his position on the Road to Tokyo rankings will be high jumper Tejaswin Shankar, competing at home after almost two years and coming with a series of NCAA wins under his belt in USA. Tejaswin has also entered in triple jump in keeping with his recent attempts at multiple events and it will be interesting to see how the youngster measures up here. Shot-putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor and discus thrower Kamalpreet Kaur will be high on confidence after their impressive performances in IGP 4 couple of days ago but the pressure will be on veteran thrower Seema Antil who skipped the Grand Prix. Javelin thrower Shivpal Singh, unable to fly abroad for training or competition, will also be in action for the first time since March but steeplechaser Avinash Sable and quartermiler Dharun Ayyasamy have given the event a miss.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/last-chance-to-punch-a-ticket-to-tokyo/article34959156.ece

But obviously, a slightly different feeling being on the right side of the result for us. Also, a part of a great game of cricket and a great occasion where it was the first, I suppose, official World Test Championship, and this is a really good feeling,” said Williamson. Praise for Taylor On his partnership with Ross Taylor, Williamson, who made an unbeaten half-century, said, “... fantastic to be part of a contribution and a partnership like that. Obviously, with Ross, our most experienced player and leader in the group, it was nice that we were able to soak up some of the pressure and then sort of score a few together, although it was really difficult to come by. But having an experienced hitter like Ross out there was certainly helpful. “You know, a really special feeling to be there at the end together and tick those runs off. Even though it was 130-odd on that surface, you never felt comfortable. It was nice to soak up some of that pressure and put together a partnership,” he said. During the post-match presentation, Williamson also credited his team for sticking to its beliefs and style of cricket.  “We know we don't always have the stars and we rely on a few other bits and pieces players to try and stay in games and be competitive. And I think we saw that in this match, we saw a lot of heart, a lot of commitment, what's important to our group and the commitment to the style of cricket we held strong, which was great,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/williamson-co-soak-up-the-top-of-the-world-feeling/article34959123.ece
25 June 2021||Chennai,||A pace battery firing on all cylinders||In his heyday, he earned the sobriquet Sultan of Swing. Now, in the evening of his life, his words carry immense wisdom. The second Test of the 2019-20 India-New Zealand series was in progress at Christchurch, Sir Richard Hadlee’s eyes scan the ground, his steely gaze picking up little things. In the middle, the Indians were crumbling, and the man doing the damage was Kyle Jamieson, all of 6’8”. “We never had someone like him before. Perhaps in the ’50s, but none after that. Nobody with his height and natural bounce,” Hadlee was speaking to The Hindu . “He adds another dimension to the New Zealand bowling,” said Hadlee. The legendary bowler’s words were ringing in the ears when Jamieson pinned the batsmen on the back foot with his lift and, with their footwork disrupted, consumed them with fuller length and swing to scalp five in the Indian first innings of the ICC World Test Championship final at Southampton. And then he opened up the Indian batting on the final day, setting Virat Kohli up with deliveries moving into him and taking him out with one that left the right-hander. Soon, he had Cheteshwar Pujara snapped up in the slips. New Zealand’s pace was always probing, but Jamieson has lent it the cutting edge with his pace, lift, off-stump line, seam movement and swing. And, he changes his length so adeptly. With the arrival of Jamieson, New Zealand’s pace attack is complete. After all, you have the left-right combination of Trent Boult and Tim Southee, who between them, have over 600 Test wickets. They come from varying angles, pitch the ball up, allow it to swing and dare the batsmen to go after them. So confident are they of defeating the batsmen with their movement. The ever-evolving Southee has added the delivery that straightens and holds its line or comes in, to his trademark outswingers. Ask Rohit Sharma who was bamboozled by one such delivery in the second innings. And, Boult is a bag of tricks. The left-armer bowls with equal control from over and round the wicket, can take the ball away from the left-hander from over the wicket and angle it across the right-hander and bring the odd one back. The talented Boult can get the ball to deviate both ways from round the wicket. He is a serial scalp-hunter. Then there is the never-say-die Neil Wagner, all heart, effort and commitment, whose barrage of accurate short-pitched bowling is mixed cleverly with fuller length left-armer's swing whether angling it across or bringing it back. New Zealand, clearly, has the pace attack to be at the acme of Test-playing nations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/a-pace-battery-firing-on-all-cylinders/article34959121.ece

Speaking after India lost to New Zealand in the one-off WTC final at Southampton on Wednesday, Kohli stated that the current format does not accurately reveal a true champion. “I’m not in absolute agreement with deciding the best Test side in the world over the course of one game. It has to be a test of character over three Tests — which team has the ability to come back into the series, or totally blow away the other team. Hard grind “It can’t just be pressure applied over two days of good cricket. It has to be a hard grind. At the end of three matches, there’s effort, ups and downs, situations changing throughout the course of the series, a chance to rectify things you’ve done wrong in the first game… Then you can really see who’s the better side,” Kohli said at the post-match media interaction. “If you saw the way this game went, why wouldn’t you want to see two more Tests of the teams battling it out to eventually win the WTC? “Historically, all the great Test series’ are remembered for being three or five matches long. I think this definitely has to be brought in. I’m not saying this because we’re not on the winning side. For this (WTC final) to be absolutely memorable, I think it has to happen over three games at a minimum,” said the Indian skipper. “We are not too bothered by this result because we understand what we’ve done over the last three-four years as a Test side. This (WTC final) is not a measure of who we are as a team, and the ability and potential we have had for so many years,” he said. On the team’s batting struggles in the summit clash, Kohli said, “We definitely need to work out better plans in terms of understanding how to score runs. We have to stay in sync with the momentum of the game. and not let the game drift away too much.”  The one-off factor does bring a unique dynamic and makes it [final] exciting. On any given day, anything can happen Williamson    Captain Kohli in   ICC tournaments   2017 Champions Trophy: Lost to Pakistan in the final  2019 World Cup (50-over): Lost to New Zealand in the semifinals  2021 WTC final: Lost to New Zealand in the final||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kohli-expresses-reservation-on-format/article34959128.ece
25 June 2021||Kolkata,||ATK MB ropes in Finland midfielder Kauko||ATK Mohun Bagan made a big recruitment this season by signing in attacking midfielder Joni Kauko, who played for Finland in the ongoing Euro Cup. Kauko, who signed the contract with ATK MB on Thursday, will be one of the star attractions in the eighth edition of the Indian Super League, which is likely to start later this year. “Many star footballers have played in the ISL, but it is rare for a footballer to sign a contract with an Indian club within three days of playing in the Euro Cup,” said a release from the club while announcing its big acquisition. Multiple roles The 30-year-old can play multiple roles in the midfield and will have a prominent place in head coach Antonio Lopez Habas' attack plans. Kauko is expected to join ATK MB ahead of the club's campaign in the AFC Cup, which is scheduled to be played in the third week of August. Kauko, who played the previous three seasons for the Danish club Esberg FB, is the first foreign signing for ATK MB this season. The club will be announcing its full roster of foreigner soon. Changes are expected as ISL will see a reduction in the number of foreigners from five to four in the playing eleven from this season.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/atk-mb-ropes-in-finland-midfielder-kauko/article34959470.ece

25 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Saurabh bags bronze||Asian Games gold medallist Saurabh Chaudhary lifted the sagging spirit of the Indian camp by winning the air pistol bronze in the shooting World Cup in Osijek, Croatia, on Thursday. Yashaswini Singh Deswal and Manu Bhaker made the women’s air pistol final with scores of 578 and 577 respectively, but the 8s and 9s saw them bow out quickly.

25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Uzbekistan Open results annulled||World swimming’s governing body FINA has invalidated the results from the Uzbekistan Open Swimming Championship held in April in Tashkent, two months after India swimmer S.P. Likith had alleged that timings were tampered with to suit home swimmers. The competition was an Olympic qualification event where two Uzbek swimmers were declared to have sealed their berths for Tokyo 2020. India’s Srihari Nataraj had clocked 54.07s in the 100m backstroke event, a best Indian performance, just 0.22s short of the mark for Tokyo. His timing of 25.11s in the 50m backstroke was also a new high. Rich haul Indians, in general, had come away with a rich haul of medals (18 gold, seven silver and four bronze), including two in the breaststroke events for Likith. On Thursday, Monal Chokshi, Swimming Federation of India (SFI) secretary, confirmed that the timings clocked in Uzbekistan were annulled after objections from various quarters. But he said that the SFI had no role in this.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/uzbekistan-open-results-annulled/article34959163.ece
25 June 2021||Geneva,||ITA alleges doping corruption in weightlifting||A culture of alleged corruption among international weightlifting officials was detailed on Thursday in an investigative report of covered-up doping cases for athletes who won Olympic and world titles. Three of the sport’s long-time leaders — former International Weightlifting Federation president Tamas Ajan, vice president Nicolae Vlad and executive board member Hasan Akkus — were charged with a range of complicity and tampering offences under the World Anti-Doping Code. Unresolved cases Alleged misconduct for a decade up to 2019, including 146 unresolved doping cases, was laid out in a 50-page document. The investigation was run by the International Testing Agency (ITA) which manages anti-doping programs for Olympic sports. Reasons for the failures to prosecute some doping cases ranged from “chaotic organisational processes” and errors to “outright negligence, complicity, or — at worst — blatant and intentional cover-ups,” ITA investigators wrote. A total of 29 cases cannot be prosecuted due to destroyed evidence or expiring statute of limitations. Ajan and Vlad were implicated in allowing a woman from Vlad’s home country Romania whom they knew was implicated in doping offences to compete and win a gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics. The lifter, Roxana Cocos, was stripped of her medal years later when re-tests revealed her steroid use. Four-year ban for Akkus The ITA has proposed lifetime bans for Ajan and Vlad, while Akkus has been offered a four-year ban. If they don’t accept the bans, the ITA will prosecute the charges at the Court of Arbitration for Sport’s anti-doping tribunal. Vlad was a gold medallist at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and long-time ally of Ajan at the IWF. Ajan was ousted after 20 years as IWF president in the fallout of the allegations first aired by German broadcaster ARD in January 2020. The ITA investigation also details how weightlifting officials evaded World Anti-Doping Agency scrutiny over several years. WADA said on Thursday it had in the past “limited powers to act against International Federations that engaged in the sort of behaviour that is alleged.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ita-alleges-doping-corruption-in-weightlifting/article34959468.ece
25 June 2021||TOKYO,||Japan’s emperor ‘worried’ about hosting Olympics amid pandemic||Japan’s Emperor Naruhito is “extremely worried” that the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics could accelerate the spread of the coronavirus, the head of the Imperial Palace said on Thursday with the Games opening in one month. The games will bring thousands of foreign athletes, officials, sponsors and journalists to Japan during a pandemic, despite caution raised by experts about the risk of infections and the public’s persistent calls for cancellation or further postponement. Yasuhiko Nishimura, grand steward of the Imperial Household Agency, told a news conference that the Emperor has voiced concerns. “His majesty is extremely worried about the current situation of the COVID-19 infections,” Nishimura said. “While there are voices of unease among the public, I believe (the emperor) is concerned that holding the Olympics and Paralympics may lead to the expansion of the infections.” Nishimura also urged the organisers to “take every possible anti-virus measures so as not to cause the spread of the infections at the Olympics and Paralympics, where the emperor serves the Honorary Patron.” The emperor is the symbol of the state with no political power. But like his father, Naruhito has gained broad popularity and his words are highly respected. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is determined to hold the Olympics despite concerns from the public and public health experts. Ugandan tests positive Adding to their concern, officials in Izumisano, a western Japan town hosting the nine-member Ugandan Olympic team for training, said a second member of the team tested positive for the virus. The first, reportedly a coach, was detected upon arrival Saturday in Tokyo. The rest of the team have been isolating at an Osaka hotel. Suga eased a third state of emergency in Tokyo that had been in place since late April and switched to less-stringent measures focusing on shorter bar and restaurant hours. But experts said on Wednesday that infections are already bouncing back in the Tokyo region and could accelerate in coming weeks. Naruhito, 61, also expressed his concern about the pandemic in his speech at an academic award ceremony Monday: “In order to overcome this challenge, it is important for all of us, in and outside of Japan, to bring our hearts together and cooperate.” Naruhito was scheduled to declare the start of the Olympics at the opening ceremony, but details, including his presence at the Games, are yet to be finalised, palace officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/japans-emperor-worried-about-hosting-olympics-amid-pandemic/article34959472.ece
25 June 2021||Paris,||The stage is set for a Tadej Pogacar vs Primoz Roglic rematch||Not so long ago, Tadej Pogacar was a just a promising outsider still learning the ropes of cycling’s biggest race. His rise to become the second-youngest winner of the Tour de France in September last year has changed everything: the 22-year-old returns to the three-week event as the odds-on favourite to defend his title. Going from an ambitious Tour rookie to defending champion in such a short time could have been an unsettling experience. But Pogacar has perfectly dealt with his sudden rise to stardom, linking his Tour triumph with victories this season at the UAE Tour, Tirenno-Adriatico and the prestigious one-day classic Liege-Bastogne-Liege. Since his remarkable feat on the slopes of the Planche des Belles Filles where he snatched the coveted race leader’s yellow jersey in a high-drama time trial, Pogacar has kept improving. He looks even stronger this year, backed by a powerful squad entirely at his service. Pogacar’s biggest rival last year was another rider from Slovenia, Primoz Roglic. The Jumbo-Visma team leader wore the yellow jersey for 11 days on last year’s Tour and had victory in sight only to crack on the eve of the final stage in a spectacular reversal of fortunes. Such a turnaround could have undone his morale for good. But Roglic has recovered in style, very quickly, and is once again among the top contenders. Right after the Tour last year, he won Liege-Bastogne-Liege and the Spanish Vuelta. In April he was stronger than Pogacar at the Itzulia Basque Country and has privileged training at altitude in recent weeks in order to arrive fresh on the starting line, ready to tackle the 3,414 kilometres of three-week odyssey across France. Delayed by a few months last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Tour starts one week earlier than usual so as not to clash with the Olympic Games in Tokyo. The race was initially set to start from Copenhagen, with Denmark hosting its first-ever start. But Copenhagen has been pushed back to 2022 because of the pandemic. The route is less mountainous than last year and features two long individual time trials totalling 58 kilometres. However, some extremely tough ascents in both the Alps and the Pyrenees are on the program, notably on Stage 17 featuring the Col de Peyresourde and another tough climb on Val Louron-Azet before ending up Col du Portet — a 16-kilometre slog with a gradient close to 9%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/the-stage-is-set-for-a-tadej-pogacar-vs-primoz-roglic-rematch/article34959478.ece
25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||No wasted motion, no needless surround-sound||India’s losing streak in Tests at Southampton got its third extension when Ross Taylor struck New Zealand’s winning runs on Wednesday evening. If the previous two defeats came in series involving host England (2014, 2018), the latest melt-down happened in a bigger contest invested with a larger meaning — the World Test Championship final. New Zealand had also stymied India’s World Cup ambitions in the 2019 edition with a stunning triumph in the semifinal at Manchester and it still remains a festering wound. Skilled unit Virat Kohli’s men again ran into the same opponent thriving on the eternally calm Kane Williamson, a set of handy batsmen ranging from fresher Devon Conway to veteran Taylor and an array of swing bowlers pitching it on a penny and also using the elements as a wonderful ally. Once Williamson won the toss and the fickle English weather kept ushering in a damp curtain, Indian batsmen never felt at ease, even if in the first dig openers Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill strung a 62-run partnership. New Zealand maximised its advantage and with Kyle Jamieson bowling with seductive precision, edges were taken. New Zealand played the percentages better and with Williamson being the batting glue in both outings, the eventual champion always stayed ahead of India. And when the chase commenced on the sixth and final day, the sun was out, the outfield dried up and shots carried to the fence unlike the previous days when the ball seemed arthritic. The winning side also had the advantage of having played two Tests previously against England while Kohli’s men only had intra-squad warm-ups. It was brave of India to step in with five bowlers while expecting Rishabh Pant, Ravindra Jadeja and R. Ashwin to serve as a bridge between the top-order and a weak tail. India needed runs on the board but what emerged proved inadequate and there was not much cushioning for the bowlers when they stepped out with their boots.  India ran into a better side and there is no running away from that fact. Williamson has shaped a unit that works with rigour, is quick to change strategy and all done with remarkable finesse while the on-field behaviour is always one of poise. This was cricket without needless surround-sound but it had a purity and smartness that would have made the late Martin Crowe proud, obviously watching his wards from the skies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/no-wasted-motion-no-needless-surround-sound/article34959124.ece
25 June 2021||LONDON,||Ramkumar fights hard, but falls in the final qualifying round||A spot in the main draw of a Grand Slam eluded Ramkumar Ramanathan yet again, as he lost to Australia’s Marc Polmans 3-6, 6-3, 6-7(2), 6-3, 9-11 in the final qualifying round at the Wimbledon championships, here on Thursday. Showing nerves of steel, Ramkumar saved four match points but eventually fell at the end of a three-hour, 30-minute contest. After the duo split the first two sets, Ramkumar had multiple opportunities to break at the start of the third but squandered all, before losing the set in a tie-break. The 26-year-old, however, raced to a 3-0 lead in the fourth set and kept his level up to take it 6-3 and even the match. In the decider, he was down a match point while serving at 4-5, but survived. Three more match points in game 12 were also saved as he stretched the contest. But the Australian broke his tenacious rival in the 20th game and punched his ticket for next week's main draw. Thiem pulls out World No. 5 Dominic Thiem withdrew from Wimbledon on Thursday after suffering a wrist injury in Mallorca earlier this week. “I’m sorry for pulling out of the upcoming three tournaments I had in my calendar — Wimbledon, Hamburg and Gstaad,” the 27-year-old Austrian wrote on Twitter. “I am determined to come back stronger.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ramkumar-fights-hard-but-falls-in-the-final-qualifying-round/article34959126.ece
25 June 2021||Patiala,||Focusing on reaching quarterfinals: Marijne||The Indian women’s hockey team will be appearing in its second consecutive Olympics at Tokyo and coach Sjoerd Marijne insists the team’s focus is firmly on realising its optimum potential. “The team’s focus has grown in the last few years, but the really important moments were the matches against Argentina. It’s not just about the mindset but also about good results. Against Argentina, I showed them that we entered more in their circle and created more opportunities but they scored more. “I am not making things up, only showing them the reality that we were creating more chances than Argentina. Their confidence has grown and there is belief that we are going to the Olympics not just to participate but to achieve something,” the Dutchman said during a virtual interaction on Thursday.  But while expectations are high, Marijne also believes in tempering them with reality. “If we are realistic, only three teams are ranked below us at the Olympics, so I don’t know what the expectations are based on. Probably because we have done well in the last four years. We are focusing on reaching the quarterfinals and from there anything can happen. “That doesn’t mean we are not good enough, just that we are realistic.” “At the same time, if we do not make the quarters, I will not be disappointed in the girls. I will be only disappointed for them because I see how much they put in every day,” he said. Staying calm Asked about handling the pressure of Olympics, captain Rani Rampal said the team had got used to it. “Pressure is always there, even on those who may have already won Olympic medals, but now we have learnt to handle it. Janneke (Schopman) has been working with us to stay calm and in control and it has helped a lot,” she said. Marijne was also categorical about his team selection. “Picking a team for the Olympics is not about the last 3-4 months, but the past four years. I don’t think a few extra matches would have done much to change my mind about the team.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/focusing-on-reaching-quarterfinals-marijne/article34958855.ece

25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Raina reminisces…||Suresh Raina is an emotional cricketer. During a practice session seven years ago, Sachin Tendulkar told him, “You have to believe in yourself, you have to believe you can do miracles.” The words from the great man meant so much to Raina that he tattooed the word ‘Believe’ on his right bicep the same day.  Believe (published by Penguin) also happens to be the title of his recently released autobiography. Through the book, Raina, with the help of sports writer Bharat Sundaresan, looks back at his life — 13 years of which he spent playing international cricket. He speakson the people and moments he cherishes the most in this journey. M.S. Dhoni Mahi bhai has played a very important role in my life. I will forever be grateful that I got a chance to play with him, under his guidance. I still remember back in 2005, when I first met him for the Duleep Trophy. Though I didn’t get much of a chance to interact with him, I resonated in a lot of ways with him. He was from one of the small towns hoping to make it big in cricket, and so was I. When we started playing, we had the same bond on and off the field: We are both desi in style. He was always down to earth. He didn’t change even when he got into the limelight. For me, he will always be a legendary captain and a fantastic leader. World Cup 2011 Memories of World Cup 2011 still feel so fresh. I missed the World Cup 2007 because of my injury so I had to make sure that I gave my best for 2011, also it was being played in our own country. I was in my best shape during that time and kept working on my fitness. Though I was not the first choice, I didn’t let it get to me. Finally I got a chance to play and contribute to the tournament. It is not a one-day effort that goes behind a tournament but a culmination of a lot of months and the team effort behind it. We were just like a family who wanted to win this trophy. Chennai Super Kings I was making a comeback after my injury when the IPL auctions happened in 2008. I was happy to know that I was with the Chennai Super Kings. All the more reason for my happiness was to know Mahi bhai was in the same team with other great players. I knew this would definitely strengthen our team. Mahi bhai and I bonded more in CSK since we used to explore Chennai in our own way. The people in Chennai started referring to me as ‘ Chinna Thala ’. I also got an opportunity to captain for CSK when Mahi bhai got injured. Yellow is something I wear with a lot of pride and is very close to my heart. Priyanka C. Raina Priyanka and I go a long way back. Our families had known each other before either of us were born. We hadn’t been in touch since school, then in 2008, we met at Mumbai airport. From there our friendship rekindled. She was working overseas but still decided to come back to India for me. She has been an absolute pillar in my life. She has stood by me through all the highs and lows. I draw inspiration from her since she has established herself really well both in her personal and professional life. Marrying her was the best decision I made.  (As told toPraveen Sudevan)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/raina-reminisces/article34959435.ece
25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||What made Umrao Jaan iconic||The cult status of Kamal Amrohi’s Pakeezah (1972) intimidated filmmakers so much that many did not even want to attempt making a film on the life of a courtesan. But nine years later, in 1981, Muzaffar Ali rose to the challenge and adapted the 1905 Urdu novel Umrao Jaan Ada on celluloid, to create his magnum opus, Umrao Jaan . Withstanding inevitable comparisons, the film managed to hold a candle to Pakeezah in every aspect, including art direction, costume design, choreography, music, acting, and direction. Some even assert that it shines brighter. Exquisite work For those who haven’t watched this exquisite work of art, Muzaffar Ali’s period film is a connoisseur’s delight that demands to be visited and revisited. The film tells the story of the eponymous courtesan from Lucknow and portrays her eventful life. In 1840, a girl named Amiran is abducted as a teenager from Faizabad and sold to Khanum Jaan (Shaukat Kaifi), the madam of a brothel in Lucknow. Renamed Umrao Jaan (Rekha), Amiran is trained in all the arts to captivate men of wealth and taste. She experiences love and happiness for a brief period in the company of Nawab Sultan (Farooq Shaikh), but when he is compelled to marry someone else to please his family, it leaves Umrao heartbroken, from which she never recovers. Rekha’s National award-winning performance as Umrao Jaan remains the crowning glory of her career. Her range as an actor is on full display; she portrays shyness, love, affection, seduction, compassion, and pain with utmost ease. Her dance, mannerisms, and expressions in the song sequences continue to be discussed among actors, film scholars and critics. It is believed that she drew upon the turbulent phase in her life at that time for her performance. The painter in Ali accentuated Rekha’s beauty through some mesmerising visuals, juxtaposing pathos with beautiful costumes and jewellery of mid-19th century Lucknow. Ali’s then wife Subhashini (former MP from Kanpur) was in charge of getting the costumes and look right. The immaculate set design and backdrops stand out in Umrao Jaan, for which it won the National Award for Best Art Direction. The attention to detail can be seen in the colourful lanterns, carpets, curtains, furniture and the interiors of the brothels, which brought alive the Nawabi era. Ali was also fortunate to have for reference some great period films like Satyajit Ray’s Shatranj Ke Khilari (1977) and Shyam Benegal’s Junoon (1978), which too had the revolt of 1857 as their backdrop.  Umrao Jaan is remembered to this day primarily for its melodious and soulful ghazals. Regarded as one of the best soundtracks in Hindi cinema, Khayyam won the National Film Award for Best Music Direction. Aided by Shahrya’'s sublime poetry, who first collaborated with Ali in his debut Gaman (1978), the trio are responsible for some of the most cherished songs on screen. Khayyam deserves special mention for introducing ghazal singer Talat Aziz to film music through the love ballad ‘Zindagi jab bhi’. Asha Bhonsle, as the playback voice of Umrao Jaan, immortalised the songs through her heart-wrenching renditions. She received her first National Award for the film’s song, ‘Dil cheez kya hai’. Films like Umrao Jaan are epitomes of art created once in a lifetime. It came at a time when ghazals were making frequent inroads into Hindi film music. The same year came Jagjit Singh’s acclaimed composition ‘Hontho se chu lo tum’ from Prem Geet.  The following year, in 1982, Jagjit mesmerised audiences again with his heart-rending ghazals in Mahesh Bhatt’s Arth and Raman Kumar’s Saath Saath . And Khayyam went on to replicate his success in Sagar Sarhadi’s Bazaar (1982), with its beautiful ghazals like ‘Phir chidi raat’ and ‘Dikhayi diye yun’, among others.  Unfortunately, ghazal in films has become a rarity now, but songs like ‘In aankhon ki masti ke’ has kept the legacy of yesteryear music and classics like Umrao Jaan alive.

25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Music on his own terms||Growing up in the 1980s was not really a great experience — there were shortages of all kinds. But there was one joy that we had in abundance — listening to Maharajapuram Santhanam live. At a time when Carnatic music, like much else in India, was going through something of a decline, he was perhaps the most stellar among a handful of musicians who held the art aloft. Santhanam was born in 1928 as the younger son of Maharajapuram Viswanatha Iyer and Visalakshi. Being the son of a genius is not a passport to success. The father was known for his brilliance and being a true torchbearer of the Umayalpuram school but his career progress had been chequered at best. Santhanam had to carve a space for himself. In any case, it is never easy to scale the same heights as a parent in any profession, more so in the performing arts. While Santhanam began early enough with performances at Tiruvaiyyaru, the Music Academy and elsewhere, he did not make waves. In the 1950s, it was not easy for a young musician to make a name for there were enough stalwarts around. But as was to be characteristic of him, he did something out of the ordinary — established a Sabha! He was keen that there should be one in the T. Nagar area, even though the Thyaga Brahma Gana Sabha was already functioning. The Sri Krishna Gana Sabha came into existence in 1953 with Viswanatha Iyer as its president and Santhanam as the secretary. In later years, he passed on the running of the sabha to R. Yagnaraman, but continued to have a close relationship with the organisation right through his life. The turning point came in 1959-60, when while on a concert tour of Sri Lanka, Viswanatha Iyer was requested to stay back and become the Head of the Department of Music at the Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan College of Music in Jaffna. He suggested his son be given the job. It was there that Santhanam truly evolved, teaching and introspecting on music for five years, between 1960 and 1965. It was still not easy to make a name upon return, and Santhanam dabbled in business. But by the early 1970s, his career had taken off and it would be another four or five years before he became the sensation that we recall.  The Santhanam style had many aspects that attracted audiences and made them adherents. His choice of songs was perhaps the first — while he included many of the weighty pieces from the Umayalpuram stable — he brought in a whole new repertoire that became associated with him. Some of these may not have been great compositions by themselves, but Santhanam gave them a polish that made them popular. He also included a few of his own compositions, which were known for their melody. The audience connect While adhering to the concert format, Santhanam gave the post-Pallavi elements due weightage. He knew that many in the audience came to listen to these lighter songs, but this was never at the cost of the main pieces, that were presented in all their grandeur. This approach drew him closer to rasikas. His was possibly the most pleasing male voice of the time. Santhanam eschewed harsh and loud renditions and when it came to the higher octave modulated his voice to the point where his critics, of whom there were plenty, accused him of crooning. But the audience loved it. I have seen men and women overcome with emotion during these moments in his performances. His raga alapanas and swaras were precise and well structured. And his niraval was an emotional experience for many. Gradually, Santhanam ensured he had a new set of rasikas, who came to listen to the tukkadas and began to enjoy the very format of classical music. Another aspect of Santhanam’s music was the sheer joy that permeated the concert platform. The accompanists and audiences were made to feel part of a happy experience. Santhanam kept the humour flowing. When singing ‘Vilaiyada Idu Nerama’ he would look at his watch. In a tillana with the line ‘Kumara Vaa,’ he would beckon to his son. In one concert, where the requests kept pouring in through chits, he picked one and announced — ‘this person has asked me to sing Mangalam’. As a speaker he was excellent, and humour was his biggest strength. His father’s wit was as famous and when he brought out a commemorative volume on Viswanatha Iyer, he ensured that the pages, apart from laudatory articles, carried a collection of his non-Rabelaisian jokes. He also established a trust in his father’s name that still awards musicians. At the Music Academy, where he received the Sangita Kalanidhi in 1989, it became customary to spread rugs in the car park so that the dozens who could not get into the auditorium were able to watch his concert on the CCTVs outside. As his career rose to great heights, Santhanam demanded and obtained fees that were commensurate with his star status. In this, he was doing a favour to the Carnatic world, which had long suffered (and still suffers) from low remuneration — compensations began to go up because of his intervention. This was attacked tooth and nail by critics, most notably by N. Pattabhiraman of Sruti magazine, who branded him ‘Mahamoney Vidwan’. To detractors such as these, it was a virtue for a Carnatic artiste to remain poor. Anyway, Santhanam was unperturbed. On one memorable occasion, when asked to sing longer, he announced in Tamil that time was up. He used the word ‘mani’ and made a counting gesture. Everyone burst into laughter. “When he was a child, I have carried him around,” said Semmangudi at a felicitation function. Then, looking at Santhanam seated by his side, he said, “Now I cannot even imagine that.” There was laughter but none louder than Santhanam’s. When he died in a car accident on June 24, 1992, it came as a shock to the Carnatic world. He is still missed.     The Chennai-based author, a historian,writes on music and culture.

25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Expanding the movement vocabulary||There is a firm belief among some practitioners of dance in India that a comprehensive and holistic approach to the study of dance is also a multidisciplinary one. The International Bureau of Education defines a ‘multidisciplinary approach’ as one that “focuses primarily on different disciplines and the diverse perspectives they bring to illustrate a topic, theme or issue.” A multidisciplinary curriculum is one “where the same topic is studied from the viewpoint of more than one discipline.” Such an approach to dance, therefore, would include perspectives from more than one movement art. Dance, as is well known, has two dimensions, one bodily or physical and the other mental. So, the multidisciplinary approach to dance is also best viewed as a two-pronged one. First, it concerns the dancing body. Here ‘multidisciplinary’ could mean understanding the bodily aspects of one’s primary dance form through the additional learning of other dance styles or movement disciplines. Learning other forms expands the body’s physical vocabulary and increases its versatility since different dance forms lay stress on different aspects of muscle strength and offer different kinds of body conditioning in terms of flexibility, balance, reflexes, instinctive awareness, breathing, and so on. Several dancers have used this approach to better understand their bodies, strengthen and prepare them for dance, and to expand their vocabulary. Among the earliest would be Uday Shankar, who added elements of European theatre, folk and tribal dances to his innovative style. Sitara Devi and Rukmini Devi studied ballet in addition to their primary disciplines of Kathak and Bharatanatyam, respectively. Chandralekha turned to yoga as early as the 60s in order to “heal” her “dance ravaged” body and later weaved martial and movement arts into her practice. Cross-cultural dancer Uttara Asha Coorlawala and Kathak dancer Daksha Sheth are other prominent dancers to work with yoga and other movement forms. Infusing Kathak with yoga When asked about why she turned to other movement vocabularies, Daksha said, “Kathak was in my body for 20 years” before she saw Chhau and wanted to explore it. “But for a person who has never squatted — we use totally different muscles in Kathak — my body was not capable.” Through injuries, she realised that she needed awareness, conditioning and strengthening. “When I saw a Kalaripayattu demonstration, I thought, this is what I should be learning for a holistic conditioning of my body”. She eventually infused her Kathak choreographies with yoga, Kalaripayattu and Mallakhamb. The second ‘prong’ of the multidisciplinary approach concerns the dancer’s mind. This involves, in a sense, the ‘fitness’ of the mind. When I speak of the mind, I include intellect, but also mindfulness, emotional intelligence, and other aspects — all crucial for dance. This is best done through a process of informing dance with meditative techniques, but also with disciplines like literature, theatre, music, art, philosophy and so on. As I had asserted in an earlier article for this paper written in  2012, “for any kind of dancing, both body and mind must be exercised equally, and used creatively.” Hereditary dancers or ‘devadasis’ definitely appear to have approached their art in a ‘multidisciplinary’ fashion. They were rigorously trained in dance but were also expected to have a significant degree of mastery in other arts, be it music (vocal and instrumental), poetry, languages or literature. These past masters of dance knew that learning multiple disciplines can only enrich their dance and inspire creativity. Like Chandralekha, who drew widely upon sculpture, painting, poetry, literature and philosophy for her dance, Daksha has explored multiple disciplines to create a distinctive contemporary body of work that has been staged to critical acclaim. Recognising the value of such is crucial to classical dance, particularly its pedagogy, especially if the notions that existed when I was a student of dance persist today. With the exception of music, which was considered complementary to dance, true dedication invariably meant a singular focus on the particular form. A deviation into theatre or sport, for instance, was considered an unwarranted distraction. I remember hearing of heartbroken 12-year-olds who were removed from dance productions because they had enrolled into a weekend theatre class or were led to believe that learning another style of dance or performance would contaminate or dilute their ‘pure’ classical training. As understandings of dance, the body, inspiration and creativity evolve, my sincere hope for the Indian classical dance world is that it embraces the most holistic of approaches — a multidisciplinary one. I strongly believe this is the most effective way to transformatively enrich one’s body, mind and practice. This confidence comes not just from my own experience as a dancer and choreographer, but from just a cursory glance at how some legendary artistes used this approach to their advantage. In fact, it may have been the secret to their genius.  The dancer and choreographer is the founder-director of Bangalore-based ‘Vyuti’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/expanding-the-movement-vocabulary/article34959035.ece
25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Evoking the navarasa||Priyadarsini Govind’s ‘Rama Navarasa’ was a restrained and dignified presentation. It stayed in the mind long after the online session was over. In Sri Rama Karnamrtam, the poet describes how Rama experienced Sringara when he saw Sita, felt valorous when he broke the bow, was surprised when the monkeys built the bridge, and angry over Ravana’s evil deeds. Priyadarsini brought out all these emotions clearly, communicating more through her eyes. Priyadarsini, dressed in a grey Kanjeevaram sari, did the abhinaya sequences seated on the floor and with masterly understatement. One could understand and experience Rama at every point. This is what good art is all about — getting the perspective right. The webinar series on Navarasa was conducted for members of NavaDarshana. Rasa in the audience is created through Vibhava (determinants), Anubhava (voluntary responses) and Vyabhichari Bhava (transitory emotions such as stories, etc) — tools of abhinaya used to communicate the sthayi bhava of the composition. An experienced dancer will go beyond the theory to understand a composition and interpret it. Priyadarsini says that a dancer not only expresses but also experiences rasa within. Expressing it right What we think we are expressing may not always be so, as what we think may be different from what we express. Since Bharatanatyam uses a stylised, perhaps even exaggerated, vocabulary of expressions, this is an important point to remember. To highlight another interesting point that we perhaps know intuitively is that what is expressed may be different from what is received, which is the difference between the sthayi bhava and the rasa. Priyadarsini gave an example from the Purananooru , the Sangam poems that speak of kings and warriors. The warrior community sends their children to the battle — veera is the sthayi bhava here, but what the audience experiences is shoka (sadness). Or how sometimes an artiste may do something funny or humorous, but it may invoke shoka in the audience, as Kamal Haasan does in the film Sadma . She repeatedly pointed out that the sthayi bhava should not be seen in isolation and is not generic; it needs shading, with reference to the situation, character, and other factors to add fullness and depth. This is how an artiste builds up the blank canvas of the stage. The dancer demonstrated a few songs, mainly the pallavis, to show how an idea can be conveyed in different ways. ‘Yaarukkagilum bhayama’ is about a woman who is not arrogant but not afraid to be open about her relationship with the king. There was more reticence in ‘Sakhi he,’ where the heroine tells her friend how much she loves Krishna, and an overflowing vatsalya bhava in ‘Thumaka chalata Ramachandra’ between a mother and her son. Thanks to the virtual medium, one could get a clearer view of her nuanced expressions. The crowning glory of Priyadarsini’s presentation was the Rama navarasa sloka, ‘Shringaram kshiti nandini’ from the Sri Rama Karnamrtam , sung by Rithvik Raja in an evocative ragamalika. Her emotions were contained, befitting Rama. Her abhinaya was like a seamless narrative, creating visual poetry.  The Chennai-based author writes on classical dance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/evoking-the-navarasa/article34959040.ece
25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||The portrait of a singer||Shankar Mahadevan of the successful composer-trio Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy and the voice behind many super-hit songs actually trained to be a veena artiste in childhood. While teaching him to play a kriti, his veena guru told him to also sing it in order to execute it well on the veena, thereby setting his singing career in motion. Hitherto unknown facets, such as this, of Shankar's life are what make Decoding Shankar interesting. The documentary, directed by Kochi-based Deepti Pillay Sivan, won Best Biographical Film Award at the Toronto International Women Film Festival, 2021. “The award couldn’t have come at a better time. Like so many others, I was going through a low phase having lost a close relative to COVID. It has instilled hope in me,” says Deepti. Coming from a family that prioritised academics over artistic exploits, Deepti often found herself mentioning Shankar Mahadevan’s example. The singer left a lucrative career in software to pursue his passion for music. “I thought the best way to drive home my point was by making a film on him. Shankar’s mother played an important role in nurturing his talent. If not for her, the world would not have known Shankar Mahadevan the singer,” says Deepti. Not a biopic Deepti’s film is as much Shankar’s biography as it is about decoding playback singing. Once ridiculed by the West, it is now seen as a uniquely Indian cultural phenomenon. In the documentary, Shankar talks about the classical notes that shape a song. He chooses some popular songs composed by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy to demonstrate how they are rooted in classical music. Unlike other biographical films, Deepti chose to have the story narrated by the protagonist himself. So Shankar holds forth on his childhood, the dilemma he faced before quitting his job, entering the world of jingles and, finally, making it as a musician. Shankar’s mother recalls how her husband insisted he complete his engineering degree, while she encouraged him to pursue music, sometimes even carrying his veena so that he could attend class after school. Shankar’s wife Sangeetha, his junior at school, recalls the initial days of their marriage and says they struggled to find time for themselves as Shankar would often be recording without a break. Casting coup It was nothing less than a casting coup when Deepti roped in Amitabh Bachchan, Gulzar, Javed Akhtar, Farhan Akhtar, Aamir Khan, Zakir Hussain, Shreya Ghoshal, Sachin Tendulkar and top admen Prahlad Kakkar and Prasoon Pandey to talk about their association with Shankar, along with Ehsaan and Loy. “I wanted to have on board people whose work has been impacted by Shankar’s music. Sachin and Shankar share a great bonding as Shankar had composed and sung a poem written by Sachin’s father.” Deepti’s husband Sanjeev Sivan is the brother of cinematographers Santosh and Sangeeth Sivan, and he staunchly supported her work. “I consider Sanjeev my guru,” she says. “Considering I belong to a family of acclaimed technicians, my husband made sure the film remained my own, with no assistance from any of them. He offered to take care of the children while I was busy shooting.” Deepti took two and a half years to complete the film, and delivered her third child during its making. Versatility and verve A management and law graduate, Deepti held varied roles in the media and entertainment industry, and also acted in the Malayalam film Kalippattam .  Decoding Shankar was screened at the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) at Goa and other festivals, including Stuttgart in Germany; Jecheon International Music and Film Festival, South Korea; and DC South Asian Film Festival, Gaithersburg. . While talks are on to release Decoding Shankar on an OTT platform, Deepti is planning a web series with Sanjeev on the Padmanabhaswamy temple and a film on the defence forces.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/the-portrait-of-a-singer/article34959049.ece
25 June 2021||June 25 2021 00:00 IST,||The art and science of tambura||You take an unassuming piece of wood and attach strings to it, and with the right kind of care, construction, and cultural evolution, it can come to produce a resonance that mirrors the very substratum of existence — like molecules, planets, and humans live and flourish on the nurturing gravy of eternal space, so do swaras, ragas, and melodies dance on the auditory fabric woven by the tambura’s mesmeric drone. When classical vocalist Ranjani Sivakumar logged on to the call to delve into the “exceptional qualities of this ancient and sonorous instrument” in a brief and enriching meeting organised by Dhvani Ohio, she had an entire narrative planned, she says. But that went for a toss when she saw the demographic of the attendees. The subject matter of the lecture-demonstration, ‘The Song of the Tambura’, promised to be a highly technical and academic one, involving at least a dozen references to psycho-acoustics, Quasi Helmholtz motion, and Pythagorean Commas. But her audience of around 40 participants was largely youngsters. And so, her tone and delivery took on a cherubic and tender quality as she slowed it down to ensure that the kids first made friends with the bulbous instrument before being introduced to its nitty-gritties, its “art and science”. “I had made extensive notes. I saw many children, so I quickly changed it. I wanted them to retain a sense of wonder around sound, instrument, and music. So many theoretical aspects fall into place naturally as they are being curious,” explains Ranjani, who has taught music at outdoor camps and alternative schools. Ranjani got hands-on, picking up a 4kg Miraj tanpura and thrusting every nook and cranny of the giant instrument into the web-cam lens to point out how the sound from the plucked strings travels from the peg-laden Langot all along the giraffe-like Dand to the mediating Guruch and bounces into the scooped-gourd belly of the Thumba after being amplified by the Jeev thread on the sound board. Just shows how important it is to incorporate intimacy and engagement in didactic methods for effective transfer of knowledge and cultivation of interest. Subtle dynamics No foray into the instrument’s nature can be made without an elucidation of its subtle string dynamics. Its unique sound is strongly influenced by minor physical aspects you could easily deem acoustically insignificant. Using a lid and rubber bands of varied tautness, Ranjani demonstrates the relationship between pitch and string tension. Once the fundamental concept has landed, she swiftly proceeds to talk about more nuanced facets. The instrument’s rich timbre and buzzing vibrance, called Jawāri , is produced by a tiny little thread that makes the strings have a “grazing contact” with the surface of a bridge made of materials as free-ranging as wood, ebony or camel bone. Sir C.V. Raman’s curiosity was kindled by the spectral auditory hues, called harmonics or overtones, that formed around each fundamental note and differentiated its effervescent tonality from that of most other plucked lute-like string instruments. One cannot say that Ranjani was able to plumb the depths of the instrument during the session. After all, one-and-a-half hours is hardly enough to scratch the surface of an instrument with a history as eclectic, a design as intricate, a presence as essential, and a musicality as quintessential as the tambura’s. While most of its genealogical cousins — the Uyghur Tambur, the Kurdish Tembur, or the Persian Tanbur — have grown into standalone and accompanying instruments that play melodies and tunes of their own, the Indian subcontinental version has retained a gravitas about it, deigning only to provide a weighty harmonic backdrop to Hindustani and Carnatic compositional forms . There’s something very compassionate and spiritual about a sound that wishes to tell no stories of its own, but only be the canvas for a myriad tales. A little like the Internet — that great digital canvas that has sustained and nestled most of human activity as COVID-19 roams the great outdoors. Ranjani is cautious but sanguine: “We must be grateful for an online option to fall back on, and surely we have learned enough to adapt — small concert spaces have mushroomed and offer recording options. The shift has made it possible to reach any corner.” Then again, she stresses that we need the organic benefits of music — between laments of several artistes switching to electronic tambura because the bulky instrument calls for care, maintenance, and painstaking tuning, and today’s listeners sipping concerts from their tinny phone speakers and miss out on the true live experience, she also emphasises the meditative properties of music that can be accessed only with focussed and non-superficial engagement with the music. The simple process of mindfully tuning a tambura, striving for sruthi shuddham , the sublime resonance of sound, allows the musician and listener to connect with something deep and introspective within themselves.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/the-art-and-science-of-tambura/article34959045.ece

25 June 2021||CHANDIGARH,||No let-up in infighting within Punjab Cong.||There seems to be no let up in the infighting within the Punjab Congress as the controversy surrounding government jobs for children of two Congress legislators on ‘compassionate grounds’ by the State government refuses to die down. Congress MLA Fatehjang Singh Bajwa on Thursday turned down the government job offer for his son Arjun Pratap Singh Bajwa, saying that the family decided to decline the job offer amid the ‘petty politics’ being played on the issue. He alleged that the opposition parties and some members of the Congress were playing cheap politics. “Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa’s (Minister) son is the Gurdaspur zila parishad chairman, Sukhbinder Sarkaria’s (Minister) nephew is the chairman of the Amritsar zila parishad and Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar’s nephew is the chairman of the Punjab State Farmers’ Commission,” he pointed out. Last week, the Punjab Cabinet as a special case, gave approval to appoint Arjun Pratap Singh Bajwa as an Inspector in the Punjab police. The Cabinet said the applicant is the grandson of ex-Punjab Minister Satnam Singh Bajwa, who laid down his life in 1987 for the sake of peace and harmony in the State. Mr. Arjun is son of Fatehjang Singh Bajwa, the Congress MLA from Qadian. The Cabinet also gave the nod to the appointment of Bhisham Pandey, the grandson of Joginder Pal Pandey who was gunned down by terrorists in 1987, as a Naib Tehsildar in Revenue Department. Mr. Bhisham is son of Rakesh Pandey, MLA from Ludhiana. ‘Policy to continue’ Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had stated that children, grandchildren of such people would continue to be considered by his government for compensatory appointment on case-to-case basis. Rubbishing questioning by the ‘Bajwa family’ on appointment of Ajay Vir Jakhar as chairman of Punjab State Farmers’ Commission, Mr. Jakhar said that Ajay Vir did not draw any salary or other emoluments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/no-let-up-in-infighting-within-punjab-cong/article34959292.ece
25 June 2021||New Delhi,||‘24 containment zones out of 4,340 have active COVID-19 cases’||Delhi has 4,340 active containment zones but only 1,797 active COVID-19 cases, according to government data till June 22. The number of such zones is higher as an area can be removed from the list of containment zones only after a 28-day period of no new COVID-19 cases being reported from the same place, as per officials. “We can delist a containment zone only 28 days after the last positive case as per Central government rules. So, even if currently there are no active cases, we cannot delist that area. But we start de-escalation process after 14 days from the last positive case and people can start moving in and out of the containment zone after 14 days,” an official said. A district-wise breakup of data showed that there was a total of only 998 active cases. The government did not explain why it is less than the official bulletin data of 1,797 active cases. Of these 998 active cases, the Central district has the highest number of containment zones — 2,253 containment zones for just 37 active cases — while the east district has the lowest, just one containment zone for 29 active cases, as per the data. “Presently there are only 24 containment zones with active COVID-19 cases and the rest have zero active cases. But these can be delisted only 14 days after recovery of the last case in the respective containment zone [roughly 28 days from last case being reported]. That is why active containment zones are more than the active cases,” a Delhi government official said. The official said almost all containment zones are “micro containment zones” and in many cases one or two houses. “In the beginning of the pandemic, we used to make very large containment zones, but for the past many months the focus is on micro containment zones and in many cases, it is just one house,” the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/24-containment-zones-out-of-4340-have-active-covid-19-cases/article34959315.ece

25 June 2021||New Delhi,||Set up emergency response team to resolve complaints: Chadha to officials||Delhi Jal Board (DJB) Vice-Chairperson Raghav Chadha on Thursday instructed officials to set up emergency response teams to address and resolve complaints, said authorities. He also laid special emphasis on the deployment of an emergency response team comprising Chief Engineers and Superintendent Engineers who will draft special task plans for critical areas under their jurisdiction in consultation with area MLAs and site visits. “These plans will then be submitted to Member [Water] for verification and further necessary action. On execution of this plan, it is expected that the number of complaints that DJB receives will reduce,” Mr. Chadha said. “All Chief Engineers are required to visit their respective areas that are facing problems, along with the area MLAs, and formulate a working plan to sort out all the water issues and submit weekly reports to the Vice Chairperson’s Office regarding the ongoing development,” he added. Mr. Chadha said a road map for water supply in the Capital based on the “supply-demand model” on important parameters such as population and per capita usage is the key for maximum consumer satisfaction. “We need to find a way to supply the available raw water in an equitable way either through a piped network or additional tanker trips. Delhi Jal Board’s officers need to ensure that the complaints received are redressed promptly without fail,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/set-up-emergency-response-team-to-resolve-complaints-chadha-to-officials/article34959313.ece
25 June 2021||New Delhi,||Man serving jail term in POCSO case allowed to attend brother’s wedding||The Delhi High Court permitted a man, serving a 10-year rigorous jail term in a Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) case, to attend a wedding ceremony. Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani directed that the applicant be taken in custody by jail or police officers in plain clothes to let him attend the marriage function of his elder brother from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Thursday. Advocate Aishwarya Rao, representing the man, argued that though this application was moved earlier, it has been listed now since he has approached the court through the jail-visiting counsel of the Delhi High Court Legal Services Committee. The Additional Public Prosecutor argued a pre-verification of the ground cited for interim suspension of the sentence was made and it stands confirmed that the man’s elder brother is scheduled to be married on June 24. The Additional Public Prosecutor, however, submitted that verification from the to-be bride’s family could not be completed as the man’s father dissuaded the police officer from conducting verification from her family, saying if they find out that the applicant is in prison, they may not go ahead with the marriage. With the Additional Public Prosecutor citing no objection to the arrangement, the court allowed the man to attend the wedding. He is yet to serve 7 years and 8 months jail term. The court had earlier dismissed his interim bail application on the ground that he had furnished wrong information.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/man-serving-jail-term-in-pocso-case-allowed-to-attend-brothers-wedding/article34959305.ece
25 June 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi court denies bail in gang-rape case, terms allegations ‘very grave’||A Delhi court on Thursday denied bail to an accused in a gang-rape case, saying the allegations against him were grave and he may flee if allowed to come out of jail. Accused Ajay Gupta allegedly lured a woman hailing from Rajasthan with a gold chain and earrings, took her to a hut of a co-accused where six people took turns to rape her, Delhi Police said. Junking his bail plea, Additional Sessions Judge Rajesh Malik observed, “Gravity of the offence is reflected from the fact that she was spotted by the accused and they took her to their jhuggi. They made her drink and took turns to rape her. The allegations are very grave.” The judge also said there was likelihood that the accused may influence prosecution witnesses or flee from justice considering the serious nature of allegations, and hence no case to release him on bail is made out. Counsel for the accused submitted that there are contradictions in woman’s statement and that a false story has been cooked up to frame his client. “Her husband contradicted her by stating that they had reached Delhi by bus, whereas, she mentioned in the FIR that she had reached Delhi by train,” the counsel said. He also said the woman had no injury mark at the time of her medical examination, whereas, she alleged that she was raped.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-court-denies-bail-in-gang-rape-case-terms-allegations-very-grave/article34959307.ece
25 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Notices served to Google to remove certain apps||Delhi Police’s Cyber Cell served notices to Google to remove apps from the play store that are being operated from outside the country and offering multiple financial investments with high returns, said an officer on Thursday. The officer said an FIR was registered against the apps — Power Bank and EZPlan. This comes after the police on June 10 busted a syndicate run by a group of Chinese nationals who cheated more than 5 lakh Indians of over Rs. 150 crore via fake investment apps. “We had arrested the person responsible for sending pre-activated Indian SIM cards to China for the scam. More than 50 digital devices used in the offence have been seized,” said the officer. He added that during probe, it was found that more than Rs. 13 crore have been moved out of the country through Cryptocurrency via Cryto Currency Exchanges. The apps identified in the scam have been found linked to Chinese servers and seven Chinese nationals — part of the scam — have been identified. “The gang sued to contact and recruit random people over WhatsApp and Telegram. In a similar way, several other apps are operating and luring small investors. They used the Multilevel marketing (MLM) model for cheating and approaching people on various social media platforms. Several other virtual bank account addresses have been traced, which were linked with the crypto exchanges and money was transferred through those accounts as well. Details are being sought from Crypto Exchanges. We are tracing money trail to identify more accused involved in the scam,” said the officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/notices-served-to-google-to-remove-certain-apps/article34959320.ece
25 June 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||CM Patnaik announces aid for dairy farmers||Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Thursday announced COVID-19 assistance for dairy farmers registered under the Odisha State Cooperative Milk Producers’ Federation (OMFED). According to the State government, 1,20,000 farmers would receive a maximum Rs. 6,000 each towards fodder costs resulting in Rs. 11 crore expenditure. During the lockdown, the farmers suffered a lot as sweetmeat shops, restaurants and tea shops, which are major end users of milk, remained closed. Farmers were seen pouring milk on roads protesting against non-procurement. “The pandemic has adversely impacted the economy of the world and Odisha is no exception. While all sectors fared badly, agriculture and allied sector sustained the economy. Farmers continued their work without giving up,” said Mr. Patnaik in a statement. Dairy farming plays an important role in the rural economy contributing to livelihoods of small and marginal farmers, he said. “Since demand for milk has come down drastically, it had impacted the livelihood of dairy farmers in a big way. Keeping this in mind, it has been decided to provide financial assistance to dairy farmers,” he said. The Congress had earlier demanded monthly assistance of Rs. 6,000 to every milk farmer during the lockdown period. Procurement, which was around 5.45 lakh litre per day, ranged between 3.75 lakh LPD and 2 lakh LPD at one point of time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cm-patnaik-announces-aid-for-dairy-farmers/article34959289.ece
25 June 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||NHAI seeks Odisha govt.’s nod for coastal highway||The National Highway Authority of India has sought Odisha government’s consent for the 384 km ambitious coastal highway project, which will connect Odisha’s Tangi with West Bengal’s Digha. Six years after the project was first mooted, the proposed coastal highway under Bharatmala Pariyojana has not made much headway. The major hurdle was environmental concerns. The road was initially planned through ecologically sensitive Chilika, Balukhanda Konark Wildlife Sanctuary, Bhitarakanika Sanctuary Area and some of the important Olive Ridley turtle nesting sites. After environmentalists raised an alarm, a long bridge proposed over Chilika was shelved, and subsequently Chilika was struck off from the plan. The highway, which was initially planned from Gopalpur of Ganjam district, will now begin from Tangi in Khordha district. Greenfield project “We have carried out a realignment to avoid disturbance to coastal biodiversity zones. The road is a green-field project. Some portions of the existing roads near Puri will be part of the highway, otherwise we will have to acquire both private and government land for the project,” said Ram Prasad Panda, Chief General Manager of NHAI, Bhubaneswar. “Some portions the highway project will require approval under coastal regulation zone guidelines,” Mr. Panda said. Presentation on realignment of the proposed road was presented before the State government earlier this week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/nhai-seeks-odisha-govts-nod-for-coastal-highway/article34959290.ece
25 June 2021||Special Correspondent,||Cong. leader’s remarks against Shekhawat create flutter||The remarks of Congress Chief Whip in Rajasthan Assembly Mahesh Joshi describing Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat as a ‘fugitive’ created a flutter in the political circles here on Thursday. In its sharp reaction, the Opposition BJP said the ruling party’s leaders were touching a new low in politics in the State. Mr. Joshi, who was summoned by the Delhi police crime branch to appear before it for questioning in a phone-tapping case registered on Mr. Shekhawat’s complaint, said it was the Union Minister who was running away from giving voice samples to the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) for a probe into the audio clips of conversation about toppling the State government last year. “If Mr. Shekhawat is clean, why is he running away? He is a fugitive on moral grounds. He should appear before the ACB and give his voice samples,” Mr. Joshi told reporters outside the PCC headquarters here. After his remarks, the Congress workers started raising slogans against Mr. Shekhawat, calling him a ‘bhagoda’ (fugitive). Mr. Shekhawat is the Lok Sabha MP elected from Jodhpur. Mr. Joshi has refused to appear before the crime branch in Delhi, saying he was not named in the FIR registered in March this year, while the matter related to the jurisdiction of the case was pending before a court in the national capital. He said the notice of the crime branch was “legally untenable” because no person above 65 years of age could be called to a police station for recording of statement. The audio clips of alleged telephonic conversations between Mr. Shekhawat and Congress leaders had surfaced during the political crisis in July last year, when then Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot, along with 18 MLAs supporting him, staged a rebellion. Mr. Joshi had lodged the cases with the ACB and the Special Operations Group of the Rajasthan police on the basis of the audio clips. ‘Indecent remarks’ State BJP president Satish Poonia said Mr. Joshi's “indecent remarks” had shown that the Congress leaders, who had stooped to a new low, were not interested any more in ideological fights in politics.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cong-leaders-remarks-against-shekhawat-create-flutter/article34959294.ece
