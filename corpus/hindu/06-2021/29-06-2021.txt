29 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. unveils Rs. 6.28 lakh crore stimulus post 2nd COVID wave||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday announced some fresh relief measures for the economy, the first such package after the second COVID-19 wave, focusing largely on extending loan guarantees and concessional credit for pandemic-hit sectors and investments to ramp up healthcare capacities. The government pegged the total financial implications of the package, which included the reiteration of some steps that were already announced, such as the provision of foodgrains to the poor till November and higher fertilizer subsidies, at Rs. 6,28,993 crore. Economists, however, noted that the elements of direct stimulus in the package and its upfront fiscal costs in 2021-22, are likely to be limited. More steps may be needed to shore up the economy through the rest of the year, they said. Calling the measures an effort to stimulate growth, exports and employment as well as provide relief to COVID-affected sectors, Ms. Sitharaman announced an expansion of the existing Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme by Rs. 1.5 lakh crore. She also announced a new Rs. 7,500 crore scheme for loans up to Rs. 1.25 lakh to small borrowers through micro-finance institutions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-unveils-rs-628-lakh-crore-stimulus-post-2nd-covid-wave/article35028631.ece
29 June 2021||Srinagar,||NIA, NSG find no debris of drones at Jammu IAF base||With no wreckage of unmanned vehicles found at the technical airport of the Indian Air Force (IAF), Jammu Air Force Station, a National Security Guard (NSG) team joined the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Monday to investigate the possibility of the use of a long-distance launching pad to send in drones with payloads of explosives. Amid the development, the Army said two drones were spotted and fired upon at a military installation in Jammu on the midnight of June 27-28. Official sources said the teams of the NSG and the NIA failed to find any debris of drones from the two blast spots at the IAF base. They were working on both the angles, the use of a local launch pad and a long-distance one to fly in the drones. So far, no spot had been identified as a launch pad near the base, which is just 16 km from the International Border. It seems the drones may have managed to drop the payload and escape from the spot. Drones, which require an open field or a building top for achieving flight, are frequency controlled and easily evade traditional radar systems.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/nia-nsg-find-no-debris-of-drones-at-jammu-iaf-base/article35028633.ece
29 June 2021||FARIDABAD,||Leopard killed in road accident||A two-year-old female leopard was fatally knocked down by a speeding vehicle on Surajkund Road here on Monday. Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) Mahender Singh Malik said the accident took place near Asola Bhatti wildlife sanctuary in the early hours. A board of doctors has been set up for autopsy. A video taken after the accident showed the leopard lying dead by the roadside with injuries to its face. Mr. Malik said the leopard strayed onto the road to hunt and was hit by a vehicle. Though there were walls on both sides of the road, the feline could easily scale them. Two leopards, including the present one, have died in road accidents in Faridabad in less than a year, said Mr. Malik. Similarly, two-three leopard deaths have been reported in road accidents in Gurugram’s Manesar as well. Besides leopards, other wild animals such as jackals, monkeys and neelgais have died or sustained injuries in accidents in Gurugram and Faridabad over the past few years while crossing the roads passing through the Aravalis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/leopard-killed-in-road-accident/article35028820.ece
29 June 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||Five-day work a week for government staff to continue||The State government on Monday issued a G.O. extending the system of five-day work in a week for the employees of the Secretariat, offices of the heads of departments, corporations and other government facilities in the Amaravati capital region with the working hours of 10 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. by one year with effect from June 27. The Andhra Pradesh Secretariat Association (APSA) had made a request to the government, seeking continuation of the five-day work in a week. ‘No facilities’ The G.O. Ms.No.59 issued by Chief Secretary Adityanath Das said that the APSA had informed the government that many employees were yet to shift their families to Amaravati in view of their children’s studies and occupations in Hyderabad and that the transport and accommodation facilities had not been developed properly in the capital region. The employees, therefore, sought an extension of the five-day work in a week till the issues faced by them were resolved. The departments concerned have since been instructed to take the necessary action in this regard.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/five-day-work-a-week-for-government-staff-to-continue/article35028622.ece
29 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Dialogue not at cost of national security, says Rajnath||Stating that the country will never forget the supreme sacrifice of those who laid down their lives in the Galwan clash last year, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday reiterated India’s commitment to resolving disputes with neighbouring countries through dialogue. However, he assured that the security of the nation will not be compromised. “Efforts should be made to find a solution through dialogue with neighbouring countries. The intention should be clear. Our Army has the capability to give a befitting reply to every challenge,” Mr. Singh said. He interacted with officers and soldiers of the 14 Corps at Karu Military Station. Mr. Singh is on a three-day visit to Ladakh to review the security situation as India and China prepare for the 12th round of Corps Commander talks to take forward the disengagement process in eastern Ladakh. This is also his first visit to the region since the first phase of disengagement in February, in which both sides pulled back thousands of troops, tanks and armoured vehicles from Pangong Tso. “We are the priests of world peace. Even when we take up weapons, that is to establish peace. Till date, India has neither attacked any country nor have we captured an inch of land of any country,” the Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/dialogue-not-at-cost-of-national-security-says-rajnath/article35028626.ece
29 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||10-month dosage gap boosts antibodies, says Oxford study||Two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, administered 44-45 weeks apart, generated nearly four times the level of antibodies than when the doses were given 8-12 weeks apart, says a report by the Oxford Vaccine Group, the developers of the vaccine, on Monday. Antibody levels remained elevated for nearly a year and a third booster dose of the vaccine, given to a subset of volunteers, also significantly boosted antibody levels to twice that after a second dose. “A single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, with a second dose given after a prolonged period, may, therefore, be an effective strategy when vaccine supplies are scarce in the short term. A third dose results in a further increase in immune responses, including greater neutralisation of variant SARS-CoV-2 viruses, and could be used to increase vaccine efficacy against variants in vulnerable populations,” the authors report in a pre-print publication. This means that the study is yet to peer-reviewed. A group of vaccine volunteers, who got their second dose 15-25 weeks after the first, saw average antibody levels at nearly twice those in the 8-12 week interval, suggesting that lengthening the duration between doses appeared to be boosting antibody count. Thus, average IgG (immunoglobulin G) levels for 8-12, 15-25, and 44-46 weeks were 923, 1860 and 3738 units respectively, when measured 28 days after the second dose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/10-month-dosage-gap-boosts-antibodies-says-oxford-study/article35028627.ece
29 June 2021||Mumbai,||Over 50% of children in Mumbai exposed to COVID-19||The serosurvey of SARS-CoV-2 infection among children in Mumbai has found that more than 50% of the paediatric population in a healthcare settings had antibodies to COVID-19. Across 24 wards of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), 2,176 blood samples were collected from pathology laboratories, including 1,283 from the Aapli Chikitsa Network and the civic-run Nair hospital, and 893 from a network of two private labs. These blood samples were made available from the samples received in laboratories for various medical tests. This sero-survey was conducted between April 1 and June 15, 2021. The overall seropositivity among children is 51.18% — 54.36% in samples from public sector hospitals and 47.03% in samples from private labs. According to the survey, seropositivity was highest in the 10-14 age group i.e. 53.43%. Taking age into consideration, the rate among 1 to 4 year-olds is 51.04%, 47.33% among 5 to 9 year-olds, 53.43% among 10 to 14 year-olds and 51.39% for 15 to 18 year-olds. The overall seropositivity rate of one to 18 years is 51.18%. A BMC official said there is a notable increase in seropositivity in the paediatric population compared to serosurvey 3 conducted in March 2021, which showed a seropositivity of 39.4% in the target age group. ‘Impact of second wave’ This “indicates that a significant proportion of children accessing the healthcare services were exposed to the virus during the second wave,” said the official. The study has also suggested targeted health education and awareness about COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. It should include the use of social media platforms, including cartoon advertisements and jingles. The survey was conducted by BYL Nair Hospital and Kasturba Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory of the BMC in the background of imminent danger of the third wave to the paediatric population.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/over-50-of-children-in-mumbai-exposed-to-covid-19/article35029112.ece
29 June 2021||Bengaluru,||SSLC examination to be held on July 19, 22||The much-awaited SSLC examination will be held over two days in July. While the examination for core subjects will be held on July 19, language paper examinations will be held on July 22. Announcing the dates here on Monday, Minister for Primary and Secondary Education S. Suresh Kumar said that the examination would be held for a truncated syllabus, which would be “easy and simple” without compromising on the sanctity of the examination. Children, who have migrated from places where they lived earlier, would be allowed to write the examination from where they were currently located. “About 10,000 students across the State have opted for this,” he added. Children with symptoms The hall ticket, he said, would be electronically dispatched on June 30 and would be available with the heads of institutions. While children showing symptoms of COVID-19 would be allotted a different room to write the examination, those who have turned positive and wishing to write could do so from the nearest COVID Care Centre. If a child was unable to write the examination, they would be considered as freshers in the next examination, he added. While last year 18 students were allowed to write the examination in each room, this time the number has been reduced to 12 per room. “All teachers, officials and staff deployed for examination have been asked to have compulsory vaccination with at least one dose. Though we were considering providing N-95 masks to children, the technical advisory committee has suggested that surgical or cloth masks would be adequate,” the Minister said. In safe environment His announcement came after a detailed discussion with deputy commissioners of districts with whom he reviewed preparation for the examination. He said that elaborate arrangements were being made to provide a safe environment for children to write examination. “Crowding will be avoided in front of centres before and after the examination and Section 144 will be in place 200 metres around the centre,” Mr. Suresh Kumar added. Every examination centre, he said, would have health centres, and ASHA workers along with para-medical staff would be deployed. Those on examination duty have been asked to report at the examination centre at 8.30 a.m. so that children could be allowed inside the allotted rooms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sslc-examination-to-be-held-on-july-19-22/article35028670.ece

Stalin on Monday urged Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan to evaluate the allocation of vaccine doses to the States till date and revise the 75:25 formula of allocation to government and private institutions to 90:10. The allocation to various States must be evaluated in terms of doses per thousand population, and the Union government must make compensatory allocation to the States that had been given a lower number of doses per capita, he said. “The Union government is buying 75% of the vaccines, and the rest are being provided to private hospitals. While I agree that a part of the available vaccines has to be shared with private institutions, I wish to bring to your notice the fact that the 25% allocation to private hospitals is grossly higher than the actual vaccinations done by them,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cm-urges-union-health-minister-to-allot-more-vaccines-to-govt-institutions/article35028717.ece

He also defended the drive against encroachers on government, forest and monastery land, and said it was unfortunate that some saw the effort through a communal lens. He said it was accidental that some evicted people belong to the religious minority group. “Muslim population in Assam has been growing at 29% and Hindus are growing at just 10%.

We need certain measures for slowing down population growth, but we will ensure Muslims themselves take the initiative,” he told The Hindu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/himanta-defends-move-on-population-control/article35028629.ece

29 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Nuclear-capable Agni-P missile test-fired||A new-generation nuclear-capable ballistic missile, Agni-P (Prime) was successfully test-fired by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) on Monday. “Agni-P is a new-generation advanced variant of Agni class of missiles. It is a canisterised missile with range capability between 1,000 and 2,000 km,” a DRDO statement said. The test was conducted at 10.55 a.m. from the Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam island, Balasore, off the coast of Odisha. High accuracy Various telemetry and radar stations positioned along the eastern coast tracked and monitored the missile, the statement said. “The missile followed textbook trajectory, meeting all mission objectives with high level of accuracy.” Congratulating the DRDO, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Twitter: “Many advanced technologies including composites, propulsion systems, innovative guidance and control mechanisms and state-of-the-art navigation systems have been introduced. The Agni-P missile would further strengthen India’s credible deterrence capabilities.” Explaining the differences from the earlier Agni class of missiles, a DRDO official said Agni-P had improved parameters, including manoeuvring and accuracy. “There is a complete technology upgrade in every way.” Cuts launch time Canisterisation of missiles reduces the time required to launch the missile while improving its storage and mobility, one defence official explained. The Agni class of missiles are the mainstay of India’s nuclear launch capability which also includes the Prithvi short-range ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles and fighter aircraft. The longest of the Agni series, Agni-V, an Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) with a range of over 5,000 km, has already been tested several times and validated for induction. In the past few years, India has also operationalised its submarine-based nuclear launch capability, completing the nuclear triad. This is especially important given India’s no-first-use policy while reserving the right of massive retaliation if struck with nuclear weapons first. As reported by The Hindu earlier, the DRDO, in January 2020, successfully test-fired a 3,500-km range submarine-launched ballistic missile, K-4, from a submerged pontoon off the Visakhapatnam coast. Once inducted, these missiles will be the mainstay of the Arihant class of indigenous ballistic missile nuclear submarines (SSBN) and will give India the stand-off capability to launch nuclear weapons submerged in Indian waters.  INS Arihant , the only SSBN in service, is armed with K-15 missiles with a range of 750 km.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nuclear-capable-agni-p-missile-test-fired/article35028539.ece
29 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Small civilian drones pose significant threat, say officials||As investigation continues into the two explosions at the Jammu airbase, believed to have been carried out using drones, defence officials and experts said there was a potent threat from small civilian drones, and the armed forces should accelerate their plans to put in place counter-drone systems. “This incident brings to reality the long apprehensions of security forces. A quadcopter available in the open market for a few thousand rupees can hit strategic targets and cause huge damage,” a defence official said. To counter this, the Services should speed up plans for procuring anti-drone technologies, which would come at a huge expense, the official noted. Another official said there had been several instances in the past couple of years where quadcopters were used to drop drugs, arms and ammunition from across the border in Jammu and Punjab. There have been several warnings in the recent past on the possible use of drones by terrorist groups. As the civilian market for drones is set to see a major expansion, requisite measures in terms of capabilities as well as policy measures should be put in place, the official pointed out. There have been warnings that Pakistan-based terrorist groups could attempt to target military bases with drones. After the drone attack on the Saudi Aramco oil facilities in Saudi Arabia in September 2019, the armed forces held deliberations on the issue and put in place plans to procure counter-drone capabilities. “There will now be a review of these progress of these efforts,” the official said. The armed forces indicated their intent to develop or acquire Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems capability in the Technology and Capability Perspective Roadmap-2018 issued by the Headquarters Integrated Defence Staff, according to a research article published in Asian Defence Review 2019 . The most popular methods of neutralising drones, as per the article, are jamming or spoofing of the radio frequency link between the rogue UAS and its operator, using Directed Energy Weapons such as lasers for dazzling of sensors or by destructing the critical airframe components of the drone and the traditional means of employing guns, missiles and other hard kill options.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/small-civilian-drones-pose-significant-threat-say-officials/article35028558.ece
29 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||India has reported 40,845 cases of mucormycosis so far: Minister||India has so far reported 40,845 cases of mucormycosis during the second wave of the pandemic, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Monday while chairing the 29th meeting of the Group of Ministers (GoM) on COVID-19 by videoconference. A total of 31,344 of the cases were rhinocerebral in nature, Mr. Vardhan said. Fatalities due to the infection stood at 3,129. While 34,940 patients had COVID-19 (85.5%), 26,187 (about 64.11%) had diabetes as a co-morbidity and 21,523 (52.69%) of those infected were on steroids. Also, 13,083 (32%) patients were in the 18 to 45 age group, 17,464 (42%) were between 45 and 60, and 10,082 (24%) patients were above the age of 60. During the meeting, Balram Bhargava, Secretary (Health Research) and Director-General, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said the second wave had still not subsided as 80 districts had a high positivity rate. He advised against any laxity at this stage. The vaccines were effective against the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants, he added. The GoM reiterated the importance of COVID-appropriate behaviour, the Health Ministry said, adding that Sujeet K. Singh, Director, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), presented a detailed report on the trajectory of the virus. Active cases Active cases continued to be mainly concentrated in Maharashtra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Odisha, which were also reporting a growth rate more than the national COVID-19 growth rate, Mr. Singh said. “While 19 States are reporting fatality figures in the single digit [less than 10], Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu are reporting more than 100 deaths daily.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-has-reported-40845-cases-of-mucormycosis-so-far-minister/article35028575.ece
29 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Allow CA exam, ICAI urges court||The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) told the Supreme Court on Monday that it had a statutory duty to conduct the chartered accountants (CA) exam in July for the benefit of around 3.74 lakh candidates. Appearing before a Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, senior advocate Ramji Srinivasan, for the ICAI, said opt-out option was available for candidates or whose families had tested COVID-19 positive. “The option can be exercised on production of COVID-19 positive RTPCR report. Such examinee would be shifted to November 2021 examination cycle,” a brief note submitted by the ICAI in the court said. The court adjourned the case for detailed hearing to June 29. The exam is scheduled for July 5. The Bench was hearing pleas to cancel the exam, like the CBSE exams, because of the pandemic . “The chartered accountants exams are professional examinations and ought not to be equated with the CBSE or other State Board examinations for Classes 10 or 12. It is in the interest of the candidates aspiring to become chartered accountants, start their professional lives and earn livelihoods, that the examinations be held,” the ICAI said. July was the apt time to conduct the exams with all safety protocols in place, considering the lull in COVID-19 cases. The third wave may hit in September or October, it stated. ‘COVID-19 cases low’ “The COVID-19 spread is now at a substantially low level, therefore, this is the opportune moment to offer the aspiring chartered accountants to further their professional careers. As on date, the number of COVID-19 cases are comparatively low and thus it would be in the best interests of the candidates if the examinations are held as per the schedule and not cancelled or postponed,” it argued. The Supreme Court had in the past allowed exams to be held whenever the risk had been minimum. “The court has been pleased to allow Class 12 exams for Kerala and Bihar, which were held in April 2021 and February 2021,” the note reasoned. The candidates were eager to take the exam. “Out of 3,74,230 candidates, as on June 27, more than 2,82,000 candidates have downloaded their admit cards, thus showing their eagerness to appear in the examinations,” the ICAI said. The decision to have the exams was taken after meticulous planning. The average number of examinees in an examination room was 12. The ICAI questioned the bona fide of the petitions seeking the cancellation or postponement of the exams at this last minute.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/allow-ca-exam-icai-urges-court/article35028545.ece
29 June 2021||June 29 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Disincentives and incentives go together in approach to population’||Since taking oath as Assam’s 15th Chief Minister on May 10, Himanta Biswa Sarma has waged a war against drugs. But he has grabbed more attention for his advice to Muslims to adopt “decent” family planning measures and for sanctioning a drive to evict encroachers from temple and government lands in which the minorities have mostly been affected. He speaks on these and other issues:  What made you advise the Bengal-origin Muslims to adopt family planning measures, and consider linking government schemes to a two-child policy in future? Today, we have been able to manage our annual population growth to somewhere around 1.6%, but further dissection of the past two censuses shows that the Muslim population in Assam is growing consistently at almost 29% while Hindus are growing at just 10%. This means there will be a lot of poverty and illiteracy among Muslims. Somehow we need to bring certain measures for slowing down population growth and for that we need to expand health and educational initiatives. You must look at our policy parameters when you talk of government schemes. First we said there should be incentives like free education for girls, financial inclusion for minority women, reservation in panchayat and government jobs for women in general, and the establishment of women’s colleges and university in minority areas. But if you only focus on incentives without disincentives, any policy is bound to fail. To put it simply, if you are punishing someone for criminal activity, you must reward people for good deeds. In a society, you have to have an approach where both incentives and disincentives work together. But the approach (to population) should come from within the community, because any effort from outside will be interpreted on political lines. What is the logic behind excluding the tea plantation workers apart from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes from the population-based incentives and disincentives? The Scheduled Tribes population in Assam is decreasing. People belonging to the tea community are essentially tribals although they are constitutionally not recognised as STs. But they are Adivasis and are either SCs or STs in their original homeland. So our policy is consistent in the national context. It is very difficult to address the issue of the demand to grant them ST status (along with five other communities). The communities enjoying ST status are opposed to the move, and I don’t want clashes because of this opposition. This has been a long-pending issue and I don’t think we can address it in a hurried manner. You have launched an eviction drive against encroachers on government, forest and temple land. Is this directed at migrant Muslims? It seems so from the outside. It is merely accidental that some of the evicted people belong to the religious minority group, but we have also evicted non-Muslims. We evicted people from Geetanagar (in Guwahati on June 26) who are all Hindus and indigenous Assamese. It is not that we are targeting a community but unfortunately, encroachment is higher on that side. For me, encroachers are a class who turn out to be Muslims or Hindus when the action is taken on the ground. As Chief Minister, my duty is to protect the forests and I don’t have to see which religion the evicted belong to. The Supreme Court and the High Court keep passing orders for ensuring that the forest cover does not reduce. I am just acting according to the national policy. As for land belonging to satras (Vaishnav monasteries) and namghars (community prayer halls), we are on the same page as the Congress and the All India United Democratic Front [AIUDF]. There was unanimity across the board when I appealed in the Assembly for Hindus not to occupy mosque land and Muslims not to occupy the land of the satras and namghars . What is your stand on the National Register of Citizens (NRC) that seems to have been left in limbo? Our NRC coordinator has filed a petition in the Supreme Court for a relook at the document. It is up to the court to hear the petition. Your government has launched a massive drive against drugs, but the major problem is the inflow of narcotic substances from Myanmar through border States ruled by the BJP or allies. Are you going for a coordinated push? We have not discussed the issue at the Chief Ministers’ level because Union Home Minister Amit Shah is coming to Shillong in July and one of the issues is coordination among the northeastern States for checking the drug menace and trafficking of women and children. I think we will see more prompt and positive results. The ULFA-Independent declared a three-month ceasefire after your appeal. Is a peace process possible despite its chief Paresh Baruah’s insistence on discussing the sovereignty of Assam? That terminology is dicey. He has his ideology impacted by decades of living in the jungles, and I have taken an oath to protect the sovereignty of the country. This is an irreconcilable matter but if we can coin another word to discuss the same issues, we can make some progress. Nevertheless, there are many people who are in touch with the ULFA-I for discussing substantial issues without insisting on the word.  As Chief Minister, my duty is to protect the forests and I don’t have to see which religion the evicted belong to||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/disincentives-and-incentives-go-together-in-approach-to-population/article35028561.ece
29 June 2021||CHENNAI,||India edges ahead of U.S. in total jabs||India surpassed the United States in terms of the total number of COVID-19 vaccine doses administered, the Union Health Ministry said on Monday. According to Our World In Data, China currently leads the world with 1.19 billion doses, while India has so far administered 323.64 million by 9.15 p.m. on Monday, marginally ahead of the 323.32 million shots administered in the U.S. Nearly 5.16 million doses were administered in the country until 9.15 p.m. on Monday. Maharashtra recorded the highest number of vaccinations (0.61 million) followed by Uttar Pradesh (0.5 million) and Madhya Pradesh (0.45 million). Between June 1 and 27, 3.98 million doses were administered daily in India on average. At the current rate, a total of 1,071.9 million doses can be administered by December 31, 2021, which is around 808.47 million doses less than that required to fully vaccinate all adults (1,880.37 million doses). To fully inoculate all adults by the end of this year, 8.28 million doses need to be given daily on average in the country. The seven-day rolling average of daily vaccinations in the country continued to increase. It stood at 6.23 million on June 27, which is more than the 4.24 million recorded a week before (June 21). About 28.6% of adults in India — 59.9% of those aged above 45, and 67.1% of those aged above 60 — were administered at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, until 9 p.m. on Monday. While 19.7% of the country’s population has received at least one dose, only 4.1% are fully vaccinated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-edges-ahead-of-us-in-total-jabs/article35028580.ece
29 June 2021||CHENNAI,||CoronaVac safe for children: study||A higher dose of the Chinese vaccine CoronaVac was “well tolerated and safe, and induced neutralising antibody responses in children and adolescents aged 3-17 years”, a study in the recent edition of the peer-reviewed journal Lancet Infectious Diseases has stated. The seroconversion rates of neutralising antibodies in children and adolescents with two different doses were over 96% after a double-dose vaccination, the paper reported. The double-blind randomised, controlled, phase 1/2 clinical trial of CoronaVac (inactivated SARS-CoV-2), in healthy children and adolescents aged 3-17 years was conducted at the Hebei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Zanhuang (Hebei, China). On the basis of the results of previous trials and considering the relative low weight of this population, two different doses — 1·5 mcg (micrograms) and 3·0 mcg — were adopted in this study. Two doses were delivered via injection, 28 days apart. The paper by Bihua Han et al, notes that primary safety endpoint was adverse reactions within 28 days after each injection in all participants who received at least one dose. Researchers also noted the seroconversion rate (development of antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2) 28 days after the second injection. The paper claimed: “Most adverse reactions were mild and moderate in severity. Injection site pain was the most frequently reported event (73 [13%] of 550 participants), occurring in 36 (16%) of 219 participants in the 1·5 mcg group, 35 (16%) of 217 in the 3·0 mcg group, and two (2%) in the placebo group. Most of these reactions occurred within seven days after vaccination and participants recovered within 48 hours In phase 2, seroconversion was seen in 180 of 186 participants in the 1·5 mcg group and 180 of 180 participants in the 3·0 mcg group. The neutralising antibody titres induced by the 3·0 mcg dose were higher than those of the 1·5 mcg dose. The results support the use of 3·0 mcg dose with a two-dose schedule for further studies in children and adolescents, the authors argued. The patients will be followed up for a year to study long-term immunogenicity and safety.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/coronavac-safe-for-children-study/article35028581.ece
29 June 2021||Pune,||Hope to resolve Green Pass issue soon, says SII CEO||Amid concerns that Indian travellers who have taken Covishield may not be eligible for the Green Pass issued by the European Union (EU) for travel, Adar Poonawalla, CEO, Serum Institute of India (SII), on Monday said he had already taken up the matter “at the highest levels” and hoped for an early resolution of the issue. The SII CEO, in a tweet, said: “I realise that a lot of Indians who have taken COVISHIELD are facing issues with travel to the EU. I assure everyone, I have taken this up at the highest levels and hope to resolve this matter soon, both with regulators and at a diplomatic level with countries.” The SII manufactures the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (with a licence from AstraZeneca) under the brand name Covishield in India. While the EU’s drug regulator, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), has approved Vaxzevria — as AstraZeneca’s shot is known outside India — Covishield has not figured in its approval list despite being approved by the World Health Organization.  In an e-mail response to media outlets, the EMA’s press officer said it had received a submission for marketing authorisation only for Vaxzevria. This was evaluated by the EMA, which lead to its authorisation in the EU. Stating that vaccines were biological products, the EMA’s statement further said: “Even tiny differences in the manufacturing conditions can result in differences in the final product, and EU law, therefore, requires the manufacturing sites and production processes to be assessed and approved as part of the authorisation process.” Along with Vaxzevria, three other vaccines have been approved by the EMA — Comirnaty (manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech), Moderna and Janssen (by Johnson & Johnson).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hope-to-resolve-green-pass-issue-soon-says-sii-ceo/article35028584.ece
29 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||P. Sainath selected for 2021 Fukuoka Grand Prize||Noted journalist P. Sainath has been selected as one of the three recipients of the Fukuoka Prize for 2021. Mr. Sainath will receive the ‘Grand Prize’ of the Fukuoka Prize while the Academic Prize and the Prize for Arts and Culture will go to Kishimoto Mio of Japan and filmmaker Prabda Yoon of Thailand, respectively. In a statement issued by the Secretariat of the Fukuoka Prize Committee, Mr. Sainath was described as a “very deserving recipient of the Grand Prize of Fukuoka Prize”. The Secretariat noted his work for creating a new form of knowledge through his writings and commentaries on rural India and for “promoting civil cooperation”. The Fukuoka Prize is given annually to distinguished people to foster and increase awareness of Asian cultures, and to create a broad framework of exchange and mutual learning among the Asian people. The Grand Prize has earlier been awarded to Muhammad Yunus from Bangladesh, historian Romila Thapar, and sarod maestro Amjad Ali Khan. Eleven Indians have received the Fukuoka Prize so far. A total of 115 people from 28 countries and areas have received the prize in the past 30 years. The prize was established in 1990. Professor Mio has been recognised for her understanding of Chinese history. Prabda Yoon will receive the prize for increasing understanding of Japan in Thailand and for pursuing “a deeper philosophical insight into the future of humanity”, said the statement from the Secretariat of the Fukuoka Prize Committee. This year’s award ceremony will be held online on September 29.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/p-sainath-selected-for-2021-fukuoka-grand-prize/article35028543.ece
29 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘CoWIN’s open-source version to be provided to 50 nations’||India will soon provide an open-source version of its CoWIN application to nearly 50 countries from Central Asia, Africa and Latin America that have indicated an interest in the technology, R.S. Sharma, CEO, National Health Authority (NHA) and Chairman of the technical committee that oversees the CoWin platform, said on Monday at the second Public Health Summit 2021 — “Emerging imperative in strengthening public health for India” — organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). India was getting ready to share its information globally, he said, adding that on July 5, it would participate in an international conclave where the technology would be presented. ‘Best way forward’ While India continued to grapple with the devastating second wave of the pandemic, vaccines seemed to be the best way forward, Mr. Sharma added. CoWIN is an extension of an electronic vaccine intelligence network, eVIN, which is used to collect real-time feedback of the vaccination programmes. It is a cloud-based IT solution for planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluating COVID-19 vaccination in the country. According to the operational guidelines for COVID-19 vaccination prepared by the Union Health Ministry, the CoWIN system, on a real-time basis, tracks not only the beneficiaries but also the vaccines at the national, State and district levels. It monitors the utilisation, wastage and coverage of vaccination. Moreover, every detail, from the sites where vaccinations are carried out to the number of beneficiaries and even the batch number, doses per vial and schedule of the vaccine, are uploaded on it. Dr. Sharma said the NHA was constantly working at improving the reach and coverage of healthcare services “and in that context, we would be bringing in an e-voucher system that allows immediate payment to the service provider for specific medical services. This will greatly improve the service delivery for patients”. ‘Prepare for outbreaks’ Speaking at the summit, Randeep Guleria, Director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), pointed out that the pandemic had stressed the healthcare system and disrupted the medical care eco-system. “But what this has also taught us is that we have to be prepared for outbreaks. We have seen bird flu, swine flu, Ebola and Zika outbreaks in the past and now it is time that we understand the importance of prevention,” he said. The country had to work at getting health a greater share in the GDP and ensure that human resources were available and trained. “The challenges we face include underinvestment in the healthcare sector, lack of the public health system being driven by technology and data, and the slow-paced development of infrastructure. COVID-19 has taught us that the way forward is partnership and we have to undertake this in a big way,” Dr. Guleria added. Doses for States The Union Health Ministry on Monday said more than 31.69 crore (31,69,40,160) vaccine doses had been provided to the States through the free-of-cost channel and through the direct State procurement category. Of this, the total consumption, including wastage, was 30,54,17,617 doses (as per data available at 8 a.m. on Monday). More than 1.15 crore (1,15,22,543) balance and unutilised vaccine doses were still available with the States and Union Territories, it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cowins-open-source-version-to-be-provided-to-50-nations/article35028577.ece
29 June 2021||New Delhi,||Credit will not raise consumption: Cong||The Congress on Monday, reacting to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s fresh announcements, said expanding the credit opportunities won’t help in generating new demand or tackle the growing unemployment. “Credit guarantee schemes have not guaranteed revival since India’s economic downturn. FM @nsitharaman needs to realise that doing the same thing over and over again delivers headlines but little else,” former Union Minister Jairam Ramesh tweeted. At a virtual press conference, Congress spokesperson Gourav Vallabh said the government’s measures would not tackle low demand, low GDP, high inflation and unemployment. “There is only one way to revive our economy. We have to generate new demand and for that to happen, we need to increase consumption. Ours is not an export-driven but a consumption-driven economy. Nearly 55% of our GDP is made up of consumption. And for consumption to go up, we need to put money in the hands of the people,” Mr. Vallabh said, adding the various sectors of the economy needed “hand holding and not expansion of credit”. Mr. Vallabh, addressing a press conference with Aman Panwar, said various studies had shown that India’s middle class had shrunk by 3.2 crore and about 7.5 crore people were pushed below the poverty line in 2020. “The BJP government has left the people alone in this fight and doesn’t seem to be bothered at all,” the Congress spokesperson said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/credit-will-not-raise-consumption-cong/article35028552.ece
29 June 2021||Srinagar,||Militants kill policeman, family||Militants shot dead a policeman, his wife and daughter in Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir late on Sunday, the police said. The incident took place at Hari Parigam village when militants barged into the residence of special police officer Fayaz Ahmed around 10.30 p.m. and fired indiscriminately at those inside. “There was a movement of Jaish-e-Muhammad [JeM] militants in the area. It seems that two foreign militants carried out the attack. They fired at special police officer Fayaz Ahmed, and when his wife and daughter tried to save him, they too were fired upon,” Inspector-General of Police Vijay Kumar said. While the policeman and his wife, Raja Begum, died on Sunday, their daughter, Rafia Akhtar, died of injuries at a Srinagar hospital on Monday morning. The incident comes less than a month after two off-duty policemen, including an inspector of the Crime Investigation Department, were killed in Srinagar by suspected militants. Political parties, including the J&K Apni Party, the National Conference, the Peoples Conference, the CPI(M) and the Peoples Democratic Party, condemned the incident. LeT ‘commander’ held The security forces on Monday arrested Nadeem Abrar, a top ‘commander’ of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), in Srinagar. “Abrar was involved in several killings. His arrest is a big success for us,” Mr. Kumar said. Initial reports suggested that Abrar was travelling in a car when he was arrested near Parimpora, which is in close vicinity of Maloora, where a militant was gunned down in an encounter during the day. A police officer said a militant could be hiding in the Maloora area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/militants-kill-policeman-family/article35028563.ece

This means that the study is yet to peer-reviewed. A group of vaccine volunteers, who got their second dose 15-25 weeks after the first, saw average antibody levels at nearly twice those in the 8-12 week interval, suggesting that lengthening the duration between doses appeared to be boosting antibody count. Thus, average IgG (immunoglobulin G) levels for 8-12, 15-25, and 44-46 weeks were 923, 1860 and 3738 units respectively, when measured 28 days after the second dose. The volunteers chosen were among those who'd been part of the phase 1/2 and phase 2/3 clinical trials Covishield, which is the India-made version of the AstraZeneca vaccine, is now the mainstay of India's vaccination programme comprising nearly 88% of the 32 crore doses administered so far. Though the dosage interval of the vaccine was initially designed as between 4-6 weeks, a supply crunch in May, as well United Kingdom data on the vaccine’s efficacy administered 8-12 weeks apart weighed on Indian experts to recommend a 12-16 week interval between two doses of the vaccine. The latest study also reported reduced common adverse events after the second dose compared to the first. After a first dose, antibody levels peaked in 28 days and after 180 days were nearly half as that of the peak. At 320 days, these were only 30% of the peak levels. A group of scientists, many affiliated to the Oxford Vaccine Group have previously shown that protection against symptomatic COVID-19 from 22 days after the first dose was around 76% and a second dose administered 12 weeks after the first, improved it to 81%. In the case of the Pfizer vaccine, a single dose conferred protection of 52% whereas it increased to 95% after the second dose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/10-month-dosage-gap-boosts-antibodies-study/article35028541.ece
29 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Mode of entry no bar to promotion of disabled’||A disabled person can avail the benefit of reservation for promotion even if he or she was recruited in the regular category or developed the disability after gaining employment, the Supreme Court said on Monday. The important thing is the employee should be a ‘person with disability’ (PwD) at the time of the promotion to avail of the disabled quota. “Source of recruitment ought not to make any difference but what is material is that the employee is a PwD at the time for consideration for promotion,” a Bench of Justices S.K. Kaul and R. Subhash Reddy held in a judgment. The verdict was based on an appeal filed by the Kerala government against a State High Court decision that Leesamma Joseph was eligible for reservation in promotion under the PwD quota. Ms. Joseph, whose permanent disability was assessed at 55%, was employed in the police department on compassionate grounds after her brother’s death in harness. “The 1995 Act [Persons with Disabilities Act of 1995] does not make a distinction between a person who may have entered service on account of disability and a person who may have acquired disability after having entered the service. Similarly, the same position would be with the person who may have entered service on a claim of a compassionate appointment. The mode of entry in service cannot be a ground to make out a case of discriminatory promotion,” Justice Kaul wrote.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mode-of-entry-no-bar-to-promotion-of-disabled/article35028546.ece

The court is already seized of similar pleas by major online news portals such as The Wire , The News Minute , and Quint Digital Media Ltd. A Vacation Bench of Justices C. Hari Shankar and Subramonium Prasad, however, declined to pass any interim order on a fresh application filed by The Wire and Quint, which claimed that the Union government was “threatening to take coercive action” against online news outlets. The court has put the fresh applications for hearing next week when it reopens after the summer vacation. “You have challenged the [IT] rules. You have made an interim application for their stay. That application has come up before the regular Bench on at least two occasions. The action they [Centre] are now taking is implementation of those rules,” the bench remarked. “Now the notice that has been sent to you is only by way of implementation of the rules, because there is no stay,” the court said. Senior advocate Nitya Ramakrishnan, for the online news outlets, contended that they were forced to approach the court now as the government was “threatening to take coercive action”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/delhi-hc-seeks-centres-response-to-portals-plea/article35028550.ece

She also unveiled a fresh loan guarantee facility of Rs. 1.1 lakh crore for healthcare investments in non-metropolitan areas and sectors such as tourism. A separate Rs. 23,220 crore has been allocated for public health with a focus on paediatric care, which will also be utilised for increasing ICU beds, oxygen supply and augmenting medical care professionals for the short term by recruiting final year students and interns. Indirect support for exports worth Rs. 1.21 lakh crore over the next five years, free one-month visas for five lakh tourists, and new seed varieties for farmers were also included in the package. The existing sop to spur employment, where the government bears EPF contributions for new employees earning less than Rs. 15,000 a month for two years, has been extended till March 31, 2022. “Setting aside the guarantee schemes and the announcements that had already been made earlier, the step up in the fiscal outgo within 2021-22 based on the fresh announcements is estimated at around Rs. 60,000 crore,” said Aditi Nayar, rating agency ICRA’s chief economist. Economist D.K. Srivastava reckoned that the additional burden on the 2021-22 Budget from the ‘three direct stimulus initiatives’ — providing free foodgrains, incremental health projects’ spending, and rural connectivity — would be Rs. 1,18,390 crore or about 0.5% of estimated GDP for 2021-22.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-unveils-stimulus-of-rs-628-lakh-crore/article35028554.ece
29 June 2021||June 29 2021 00:00 IST,||NIA, NSG find no debris of drones at IAF base||So far, no spot had been identified as a launch pad near the base, which is just 16 km from the International Border. It seems the drones may have managed to drop the payload and escape from the spot. Drones, which require an open field or a building top for achieving flight, are frequency controlled and easily evade traditional radar systems. They could cover up to 30-40 km of distance. Police sources said a few persons working at the base were questioned but let off later. So far, India has not blamed any country for the attack, which has left two IAF personnel injured. Meanwhile, the Army has sighted and opened fire at two drones near a military installation in Jammu’s Kaluchak. “On the midnight of June 27-28, two drone activities were spotted over the Ratnuchak- Kaluchak Military area by alert troops,” defence spokesman Lt. Col. Devender Anand said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nia-nsg-find-no-debris-of-drones-at-iaf-base/article35028555.ece

29 June 2021||June 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Desika’s masterstroke||In a sloka in Vedanta Desika’s Yadavabhyudaya, Yoga Maya says to Kamsa, “I am the maya of the One who killed Madhu and Kaitabha.” This reference to Madhu and Kaitabha here, by Desika, is a masterstroke, said V.S. Karunakarachariar, in a discourse. It reminds us of the Lord’s Hayagriva avatara and Durga’s role during that avatara. Hayagriva avatara is described in the Santi Parva of Mahabharata, and also in Devi Bhagavatam. Brahma was given the Vedas by the Lord and asked to create, using the Vedas as his guiding manual. But Brahma became arrogant because of the important role he had been assigned. To curb his pride, the Lord caused two asuras to emerge from His ears. Brahma was on the Lord’s navel, and the two asuras made their way towards Brahma. Brahma was not afraid of them. He stroked one of them and remarked, “You are soft [mridu].” Mridu became Madhu, which became that asura’s name. Brahma then touched the other asura and said, “Your body is hard [kathina].” And so, this asura came to be called Kaitabha. The asuras stole the Vedas from Brahma. They were able to do something so daring, because they had the protection of Yoga Maya (Durga). How did they earn Her favour? When the two asuras appeared, clouds and lightning appeared. The asuras, upon seeing this, exclaimed, “Ai.” This is a beejakshara in the Durga mantra. Upanishads say that if there are obstacles to one’s bhakti yoga, this mantra should be recited. Although the asuras had not consciously and knowingly uttered the beejakshara “ai”, the very fact that they had said it, got them Yoga Maya’s protection. Eventually, Lord Narayana took the Hayagriva avatara to kill the demons. It is to remind us of this important avatara that Desika’s sloka has Durga mentioning the two asuras.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/desikas-masterstroke/article35028578.ece

29 June 2021||Kolkata,||Bengal Bar Council wants acting CJ removed||Chairman of the Bar Council of West Bengal Ashok Kumar Deb has written to Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana, seeking the removal of acting Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court Rajesh Bindal owing to his alleged bias. “We would like to set out some instances which has given rise to perception that Hon’ble Bindal is an unfair, biased and partial judge and whose continuance at the Hon’ble High Court interferes with the fair and impartial dispensation of justice,” the letter dated June 25 said. Mr. Deb, who is also a Trinamool Congress MLA, noted the ‘way’ bail to the four accused in the Narada case was withheld without hearing the accused and “improper listing” of various cases, including the election plea of the Chief Minister. It pointed to the listing of the election petition before Justice Kausik Chanda “while being completely and fully aware of Hon’ble Justice Chanda’s long-standing association with the BJP”. Mr. Deb, while referring to social media posts, said “an impression is sought to be given that Hon’ble Justice Bindal is BJP’s man through and through”. The letter also referred to a letter by Justice Arindam Sinha on May 24, wherein the judge had taken “serious exception to the manner in which the Narada bail matter was handled by the Division Bench headed by Hon’ble Justice Bindal”. It said, “We beseech Your Lordship to take immediate steps for removal of Hon’ble Justice Rajesh Bindal as a Judge of Calcutta High so that the majesty and sanctity of the Calcutta High Court is upheld and to ensure people’s confidence in judiciary does not fall to pieces”. The BJP described the letter as an attempt to “browbeat the judiciary”. The reason for seeking Justice Bindal’s removal was political, it alleged. “Just because Calcutta HC is holding the administration to account for the post-poll violence, the CM is using Ashok Kumar Deb, TMC MLA from Budge Budge, under the garb of the Bar Council, to seek the removal of the acting Chief Justice. Bid to browbeat judiciary?,” said BJP leader and co-observer to West Bengal Amit Malviya.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bengal-bar-council-wants-acting-cj-removed/article35028565.ece

29 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Spell out stand on implementing State Mental Health Policy: HC||The Madras High Court on Monday directed the State government to spell out its stand on implementing the State-level Mental Health Policy so that "the mentally challenged are accorded the basic human dignity to which they are entitled to and the larger society begins to take care of such vulnerable section." Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy called for the government's response by August 2. The order was passed on a public interest litigation petition filed by CHEER, a non-governmental organisation based in Chennai, which insisted upon effective implementation of a policy framed in 2019. Observing that the immediate need was to provide shelter to the mentally challenged destitutes and vaccinate them against COVID-19, the judges directed the government to put to effective use a 10.5-acre government facility available in Tiruvallur district and make sure that the inmates of that facility were vaccinated on priority. "There are many persons who are abandoned by their families and roam around in the streets. They should be taken care of at the local level. Municipalities, corporations and panchayats should pay attention that such persons are provided some shelter and vaccinated," the court ordered. Special drive Referring to a special drive carried out in Chennai to vaccinate the home-bound differently abled people in Chennai at their doorsteps, the court ordered that a similar drive should be conducted for the mentally challenged too in the next five weeks and a status report should be filed in the court by the Health Department. "It is imperative that a special vaccination drive be undertaken, by whatever means that may be effective, to prioritise the mentally ill persons and ensure that they are vaccinated. The policy of having mobile teams travel to persons with disabilities, rather than making such disadvantaged persons come to vaccination centres, may be adopted in case of mentally ill persons too," the Bench ordered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/spell-out-stand-on-implementing-state-mental-health-policy-hc/article35028736.ece

29 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Covaxin special drive covers over 50% of targeted group||The special drive conducted by the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) for four days to inoculate those who missed the second dose of Covaxin managed to cover more than 50% of the target group. Officials from the GCC said another round of tracking and follow-ups would be planned to identify and inoculate those who missed the second dose within the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-advised window of four to six weeks. Data collated by the civic body from COWIN portal last week showed that around 50,000 people, who took their first dose of Covaxin in the city, had missed the second dose within the maximum advised window. Prior to this, the GCC had identified and inoculated another 30,000 such people who had missed their second dose. Consequently, the special drive was launched to cover 50,000 people. “Of these, our data showed that only around 30,000 had actually missed it. The rest must have taken their second dose, but this was not reflected in the COWIN portal due to duplication issues. Some might have taken their second dose outside Chennai as well,” a senior official said. Of this target of 30,000 people, the official said the city managed to cover 16,000 people during the special drive over four days. Highlighting that further analysis would be done to identify the remaining people who missed the jab, the official said another round of follow-ups would be done through telecounselling centres and door-to-door fever survey workers. “In the past few days, more such people who missed their second dose must have been added to this list. We will obtain relevant data from the COWIN portal and work out a strategy to cover them,” he added. Booking open The Greater Chennai Corporation on Monday reopened its portal for booking slots for vaccination. The vaccination programme was stopped on Monday owing to a shortage of vaccines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/covaxin-special-drive-covers-over-50-of-targeted-group/article35028734.ece
29 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Hundreds of restaurants up for sale||Hundreds of restaurants across Tamil Nadu are up for sale, and many have shut down in the last three months after the second wave of COVID-19 hit the State. Sources said the data were yet to be collated, and the number would be clear only after the lockdown was lifted completely. But those in the real estate sector said several restaurants in Chennai, Coimbatore, Salem, Tiruchi and Madurai, among other places, had put themselves up for sale. A similar trend was seen last year after the first wave struck. Then, those in the hotel industry said over 2,000 small, medium and big restaurants had folded up. “With news about the third wave doing the rounds, those in the business do not want to take any chances. Some of the properties that have been put up for sale are on State and National Highways, some are near schools and colleges and some near information technology corridors. Those who have taken franchises from bigger brands are also struggling to sell,” said a source in the hotel industry. He added that restaurants near movie halls and other public places had closed permanently. Sukanya Bhaskaran, who runs a franchise of a fried chicken brand on Santhome High Road, said her business dwindled by over 90% and she had no other option but to put it up for sale. “My employees who left during the first wave never returned, and there was a huge pressure from the landlords to pay up the rent. Sales were low and we hardly got orders through food aggregators,” she said. “Earlier, people used to stop along highways to have food and refreshment. After the pandemic, the number has dropped. Buses have stopped halting at too many places. Lorry drivers are operating on tight schedules, having no time to stop,” said Ashokan, who is into the restaurant business for seven years now. “I have two restaurants on the Salem highway and I have closed one, and put up all the assets and the second hotel for sale.” Labour cost gone up Restaurant owners pointed out that labour costs had gone up. “If you don’t pay the workers, it is difficult to retain them,” said one of them. Even bigger brands seem to be struggling after the second wave, and some have wound up a few branches. M. Ravi, president of the Chennai Hotels Association and chairman of Vasanta Bhavan Hotels India, said many small hotels had vanished, and there were no takers for the spaces opened up for sale. “Losses have been mounting for those in this business,” he said. Mr. Ravi has closed a few branches across the State. K.T. Srinivasa Raja, managing director of Adyar Ananda Bhavan Sweets India, said hotels hardly got 15% business through food aggregators and takeaways. “We have also closed some of our branches,” he said. He added that those who supported the restaurants, such as vegetable and milk vendors and raw material suppliers, had also lost money. Most hoteliers and restaurant owners cautioned that this was not the right time to buy hotels coming up for sale. They said it would take another year or two for the industry to stabilise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hundreds-of-restaurants-up-for-sale/article35028758.ece
29 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Corpn. to keep city free from floods||The Greater Chennai Corporation has identified 93 places in 23 localities, which are prone to flooding during the monsoon, to build storm water drains. However, there is flooding in these spots only when the rainfall is above 18 cm per hour. The civic body’s flood-monitoring officers, who visited most of the identified spots in the central parts of the city, found that the cause of flooding was old storm water drains built more than 30 years ago. A senior official said the construction of new drains, after demolition of the existing structures, had been taken up at more than 50 places. In a few places, the absence of links to the nearby network of drains was causing flooding. Desilting work The civic body has drawn up a plan to undertake desilting of storm water drains and major canals to have a flood-free monsoon. Local officials have been asked to identify, by the middle of July, vulnerable areas and structures which have to be cleaned, ahead of the tender process. Spread across 15 zones, the length of the network of drains is estimated to be about 2,000 km in the city, said the senior official. The civic body maintains 30 major canals, including the Kodungaiyur, Captain Cotton and Padikuppam ones. Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi had ordered clearing of major canals using modern machinery, such as mini-amphibian vehicles, robotic excavators and floating trash booms. The civic body normally allocates Rs. 5 crore for each region in the city, which has been segregated into three — north, central and south — with the Regional Deputy Commissioners (RDC) heading the regions allocating the amount proportionately to all the 15 zones as per the local requirement. The senior official said once the estimates were prepared by the assistant engineers of all the 200 divisions, estimates would be verified by the zonal heads, comprising assistant executive engineers, executive engineers and zonal officers, for recommendation to the RDCs. The local officials were identifying places where desilting of drains needs to be undertaken and once the list is compiled, the Regional Deputy Commissioners will give administrative sanction for calling tenders. Plans are afoot to start the work by the first week of August and complete it by October-end. The civic body, after the December 2015 floods, had divided the 15 zones into the basins of Kosasthalaiyar, Kovalam, Adyar and Cooum. While work on the storm water drains had been completed in the Adyar and Cooum basins, a portion of the work was yet to be completed in the Kovalam basin. The civic body would be executing the work in the Kosasthalaiyar basin, covering major parts of north Chennai.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-to-keep-city-free-from-floods/article35028725.ece
29 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Temples reopen, but crowds stay away||Temples, churches and mosques in and around the city saw comparatively less crowds when they reopened on Monday. Authorities at temples, including Kapaleeswarar temple and Mundagakanniamman temple in Mylapore, said there were not many devotees. More devotees are expected on Tuesday, which is considered auspicious. “People just walked in, had darshan and left. Devotees are not allowed to sit inside, or touch walls or idols in the prakarams or prostrate at the dwajasthambam,” said a Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department staff. Around 3,000 temples in Chennai, Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram and Chengalpettu districts reopened on Monday. Devotees were not allowed to perform ‘archanais’ or light lamps. At the 200-odd churches under the Archdiocese of Madras - Mylapore, parishioners were allowed to walk in and pray while standing for a few minutes and then leave. In some places, people were allowed to light candles. “We are ensuring proper personal distancing. People kneel outside the churches if they want,” said Father Vincent Chinnadurai, Episcopal Vicar of the Archdiocese. Mosques have told their members to wear masks and bring their own prayer mats. Boards mentioning the dos and don’ts have been placed prominently. “We cleaned the entire place, including carpets and even walls. We have also split those coming in for prayers into two batches to avoid crowding,” said L.K.S. Syed Ahmed, president, Masjid Javeed, in Anna Nagar. The Masjid had organised vaccination drives for residents in the area. Meanwhile, on Monday, the department also organised a vaccination drive for temple staff.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/temples-reopen-but-crowds-stay-away/article35028748.ece
29 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||People eager but vaccines are in short supply: Medical Minister||Minister for Medical and Family Welfare Ma. Subramanian on Monday said the people of the State were eager to get vaccinated against COVID-19 but the major problem was the non-availability of vaccines to inoculate the entire eligible adult population. Addressing a special vaccination camp for lawyers in Chennai, he said not just the rural population but also the tribal people of the State had shown an interest in taking the jab. Providing exact figures, he said the State had so far received 1,44,39,940 doses of vaccines and had vaccinated 1,41,50,249 people. There were 2,07,345 doses available in stock and they would get exhausted in the course of the day, he said. “It is painful to see that most of the vaccination centres in Chennai city had hung boards announcing the non-availability of vaccines. This would be the state of affairs in other districts too by the end of the day. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin has impressed upon the Centre to increase the allocation of vaccines to Tamil Nadu,” he said. The Minister also stated that out of all 234 Assembly constituencies in the State, the Chepauk-Thiruvallikeni constituency represented by Udhayanidhi Stalin had emerged as the frontrunner with around 90,000 people having got vaccinated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/people-eager-but-vaccines-are-in-short-supply-medical-minister/article35028753.ece
29 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||College admissions only after July 31: Minister||Colleges may admit students only after the Class 12 results are published, Tamil Nadu Higher Education Minister K. Ponmudi has said. Action would be taken on complaints against any college admitting students before the results are declared, he told reporters. Colleges must admit students only on the basis of the Class 12 marks and should not conduct any entrance test. Any college found violating the government’s decision would face action, he said. Mr. Ponmudi said the Supreme Court had instructed the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) to provide the Class 12 results by July 31. Similarly, in the absence of a common public examination, the State was working out a methodology to award marks to State board students. He said, “We have to take into account the results of the CBSE students. The Chief Minister has announced the methodology for calculating Plus 2 marks. The process will be finalised by July 31. Only thereafter may colleges — be they private, aided or government institutions — start the admission process. They may start the process only from August 1.” But the State would not delay the admission process for the optional examinations announced by the CBSE, he said. This rule did not apply to polytechnic colleges as students were admitted on the basis of Class 9 marks, he said. Admission to polytechnic courses commenced last week. As for the admission through the single window system for Anna University, Mr. Ponmudi said the usual method would be followed.  Action will be taken against any college admitting students before the results are declared||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/college-admissions-only-after-july-31-minister/article35028755.ece

29 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Unearth names of Govt. college staff involved in tender irregularities’||The Madras High Court on Monday directed the State government to unearth the names of Coimbatore Government College of Technology staff and their family members reportedly involved in bagging the tenders floated by the institution. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy directed Higher Education Secretary to disclose to the court, by August 9, the relationship between the employees of the college and those who had been awarded the tenders. Ordering that the Secretary should also explain how the matter had escaped the attention of the government, the court made it clear that immediate remedial measures should also be taken if anything remiss was discovered during the inquiry. PIL petition The interim orders were passed on a public interest litigation petition filed by R. Mahalingam of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) last year. The petitioner had claimed that two employees of the college had floated a few companies in the names of their family members and bagged college contracts. Claiming that some of the bids had been submitted using college computers, the petitioner insisted upon a Directorate of Vigilance and Anti Corruption (DVAC) inquiry to unravel the truth. He feared that the malaise might be deep rooted than what appeared to the eye.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/unearth-names-of-govt-college-staff-involved-in-tender-irregularities/article35028809.ece

Selvaperunthagai is likely to meet Speaker M. Appavu on Tuesday and request him to remove the speech of Tiruchengode MLA E.R. Eswaran who had hailed the absence of the slogan ‘Jai Hind’ in the Governor’s address. “For many years, the usage of Jai Hind has been there in the Governor’s address. But the omission this time does not seem to be a deliberate one. They just went ahead with ‘ Nandri, Vanakkam’. Even the Governor has not asked about it [leaving out the slogan],” Mr. Selvaperunthagai told The Hindu . The Congress leader said that while the MLA had already clarified that he was not against the slogan, this was an unnecessary controversy. “The term Jai Hind basically belongs to the Tamils. It was Chempakaraman Pillai who had coined the term and then Behari Bose took it to Bihar and those parts of India. Netaji [Subash Chandra Bose] used it widely and Gandhiji in fact used the term while sending a piece of silk to the Queen,” Mr. Selvaperunthagai said. He said he would give a letter to the Speaker requesting him to remove the portion of the MLAs speech from the Assembly records and put an end to the controversy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cong-to-ask-speaker-to-remove-reference-to-jai-hind-speech-by-mla/article35028740.ece
29 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||BJP leader moves High Court against committee to study NEET impact||BJP State secretary K. Nagarajan has filed a public interest litigation petition before the Madras High Court seeking to quash an order issued by the Tamil Nadu government on June 10, constituting a committee headed by Justice A.K. Rajan to study the impact of the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) on medical aspirants. The case has been listed for admission before Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy on Tuesday. Stating that the committee had already begun eliciting opinions from members of the public, the petitioner pressed for an interim stay on the operation of the government order. According to the litigant, the committee had been constituted on the basis of a view taken by Chief Minister M.K. Stalin that government school students and those from rural backgrounds were struggling to get admission to medical colleges owing to the introduction of NEET and therefore, such admissions should be made on the basis of Plus Two marks. Despite having taken such a view, the government had chosen to constitute a nine-member committee, headed by a retired judge of the High Court, to study the impact of the test, the petitioner said, terming it a wasteful expenditure of public money. Referring to the recent constitution of the National Medical Commission (NMC), which replaced the Medical Council of India, the petitioner said any suggestion for improvement of medical education could be made to the NMC. He contended that the NMC was a body chaired by a medical professional of outstanding ability. Mr. Nagarajan said NEET was introduced after several studies and legal pronouncements. Claiming that several educational institutions in the State were promoting rote learning in higher secondary classes, the litigant said that relying upon Plus Two marks for medical admissions would lead to the selection of “average minds and below average students”. Contending that students in the State had become accustomed to NEET in the last four years, the petitioner accused the State government of politicising the issue and creating confusion. He said the constitution of the committee was far beyond the competence of the State and termed it a reckless act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bjp-leader-moves-high-court-against-committee-to-study-neet-impact/article35028759.ece

The property, worth Rs. 20 crore, is located off the Pallavaram-Thoraipakkam Radial Road and is some 2 km from the temple. The property had been sold off as residential plots by Palanivel after showing as if the two survey numbers were in his name, said a source in the temple. Minister P. K. Sekar Babu oversaw the removal of a few mechanic sheds and kabadiwallah shops in the presence of Rural Industries Minister T. M. Anbarasan and Commissioner J. Kumaraguruparan. Pe. Su. Mani, a senior citizen and resident of Arakkonam, who had unknowingly purchased a plot of land, said he and several others had lost several lakhs of rupees in the transaction. “Only when I went to pledge the land for a loan, I found out that it belonged to the temple. We are now hoping that the police would help us get back our hard-earned money,” he said. The temple authorities plan to fence off the land and place information boards so that there are no further encroachments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/encroachments-on-temple-land-removed/article35028737.ece

29 June 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||BU accused of changing HODs against rules||A war of words has begun between two former Bharathiar University Syndicate members and Vice-Chancellor P. Kaliraj with the former alleging that rules and conventions have been thrown to wind in appointing heads of departments. The former Syndicate members P. Kanagasabapathy and P. Kandasamy have alleged that recently Mr. Kaliraj had unilaterally changed the Head of Department, Physics, which was against rules as only the senior most professor was holding the HoD position. They had also learnt that the Vice-Chancellor had similarly changed the heads of six departments and one of the six had moved the court to return to the post. In another department, he had changed the Head to give it to a faculty who was only in the rank of assistant professor.  The change of leadership in the Physics Department took place without the incumbent’s knowledge, during the pandemic and the sudden changes had demoralised the honest faculty. Mr. Kanagasabapathy and Mr. Kandasamy complained that the changes had come at a time when the University was without a full time Registrar and Controller of Examination. In response to the allegations, Mr. Kaliraj said he had not removed the Head of the Department, Physics, but promoted him Dean, Science. The person concerned now had 10 science departments under his watch. Likewise, he had to change the head of the Department of Medical Physics as the incumbent’s core competency was something else. An assistant professor in the Department had the requisite qualification, which prompted to make the changes. Defending his decision, the Vice-Chancellor said he was well within his powers to change the heads of departments and all his decisions were well within the rules. The changes made to heads of departments was as per the University Grants Commission rules and it had been a practice that had been in vogue in several universities in the State, he also said. Responding to the VC’s defence, Mr. Kanagasabapathy and Mr. Kandasamy said the explanations did not hold good and there had been instances in the Bharathiar University where a few deans continued to hold the HoD posts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bu-accused-of-changing-hods-against-rules/article35028811.ece

Dhanapal, an auto rickshaw driver in Ramanathapuram, said he received seven trips on Monday through app-based taxi services, an improvement given that he used to receive only one or two trips a day when e-registration was mandatory. “Though there is an increase, it is still not enough to meet the expenses,” he said.

The elephant, which remained in Sirumugai forest range limits, crossed the Kotagiri road on Sunday evening and entered the Mettupalayam forest range limits. Three teams of veterinarians, along with field staff of the department, stayed at different locations in the forest to prevent the elephant from moving uphill towards the Nilgiris via Kallar. Though one of the veterinarians fired a dart at the elephant, it did not hit the target due to obstructions caused by bushes. The elephant remained inside the forest behind the timber depot of the department till evening on Monday. It crossed the Kotagiri road around 5.30 p.m. and entered the limits of the Sirumugai forest range, from where it had come to the Mettupalayam side. Though a fourth veterinarian was posted on the Kotagiri road with a dart gun, the tusker crossed the road and entered the forest before he could spot the animal. District Forest Officer D. Venkatesh said the elephant was very agile. It was moving through new places after multiple teams started monitoring it, he said.

Sakthivel, who assumed office as chairman of FIEO on Monday. The target is achievable with the joint efforts of the government and the industry. The growth in exports in April and May are an indication that exports will keep growing. The FIEO will have an export promotion cell to identify new markets and products. It will continue to host virtual expos, which will benefit the MSMEs. “I will create a virtual platform within FIEO to showcase products of our members and to do the export promotion focusing on new countries and new products,” he said. The FIEO will also take part in virtual international exhibitions. The contribution of MSMEs in exports should increase. The government and the industry should increase their marketing budgets and the government should look at enhancing market access initiative funds from the current Rs. 200 crore. Alternatively, a planned scheme for marketing aimed to take exports to $ 1 trillion in next five years may be rolled in with a minimum corpus of Rs. 1,000 crore annually. Another push for marketing should come from free trade agreements with major trading partners: the United States, the United Kingodm and the European Union besides one with Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Israel. Such FTAs will help attract FDIs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fieo-to-focus-on-export-promotion/article35028813.ece

Periyasamy on Monday gave away 10 kg of rice, grocery kit bags and financial assistance of Rs. 4,000 each to 188 archakas serving in temples in the district. The Minister said all shrines in the State remained out of bounds for devotees due to the pandemic. The lockdown resulted in people remaining indoors and economic activities coming to a standstill. To overcome the medical emergency, the State government under the leadership of Chief Minister M.K. Stalin thad taken numerous measures. As a result of the works carried out by multi-department officials and frontline workers, the number of positive cases had subsided to a great extent. In a bid to give hope of resuming normalcy, the government had announced certain relaxations, while the curfew continued to remain in force in over 10 districts, he said and thanked the people for their cooperation with the official machinery. Recalling the efforts of late Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, he said the DMK, whenever it came to power, served all classes of people without any discrimination. Be it temples, mosques, churches or gurudwaras, the welfare measures reached all the needy. Since the time the Justice Party laid out the guidelines for HR&CE administration, several reforms were brought in by Mr. Karunanidhi. Today, Mr. Stalin was following the same path, which fetched desired results. Collector S. Visagan said there were 149 temples in the district with sound financial resources and managed affairs on their own, while 1,511 had limited resources. The government had stepped in to rescue archakas of these temples with the aid. Lok Sabha MP P. Velusami, HR&CE Assistant Commissioner Anitha, Assistant Collector (Training) Priyanka and others participated. In a brief chat with reporters, Mr. Periyasamy took a dig at AIADMK MLA Natham R Viswanathan for his remark that whenever the DMK came to power, there was power shortage in the State. He said the AIADMK government had indulged in mismanagement and substations were being maintained by Tangedco as per the protocol only after the DMK came back to power. All efforts would be made to retrieve HR&CE lands that belonged to in the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/188-temple-priests-receive-relief-in-dindigul-district/article35029090.ece

Blaming the Centre for the rise in petrol and diesel, the protesters said the BJP leaders were unconcerned about the sufferings of the common man. The Left party conducted agitations at 16 places, including near the Collectorate, in the district. The VCK members also joined a similar stir and demanded that the Centre roll back the fuel prices. At a time, when the people were put to sufferings due to the pandemic and had to remain indoors without any economic activity, such skyrocketing price rise only pushed them further down, they said. Tirunelveli In Tirunelveli, the Left parties and VCK cadre began their three-day demonstration here on Monday. The demonstration organised at Vannarpet saw the participation of CPI, CPI (M), CPI (ML) and VCK cadre. The protestors condemned the Centre for “adamantly refusing” to take any positive measure to check the fuel price hike. Even though a litre of petrol had crossed Rs. 100 at several places, the Narendra Modi-led government was just watching it without taking any action, they said. They also condemned the Centre for not leasing out the Integrated Vaccine Complex in Chengalpet to the State government for manufacturing vaccines. “Since the facility is in Tamil Nadu, the Centre is refusing to give permission for leasing it out to the State,” they said. They also demanded that the Centre give Rs. 7,500 a month to every family besides free essential commodities in the wake of COVI-19. Similar agitations were conducted at Ambasamudram and Valliyoor also.

T. R. P. Thiagarajan. He was talking to reporters after discussing land acquisition and other airport-related issues with Minister for Commercial Taxes and Registration P. Moorthy, Collector S Aneesh Sekhar and Airport Director S. Senthil Valavan. Stating that 90% of the 620 acres meant for airport expansion had been acquired, Mr. Thiagarajan said that the final work pending with the State Department of Finance would be cleared soon. “Chief Minister M. K. Stalin has cleared the issue after we took up it with him for expeditious processing of land acquisition for airport development,” he added. The Airports Authority of India has proposed to increase the length of the runway from the existing 2,300 metres to 3,800 metres so that wide-bodied aircraft could be handled. Besides, it has also decided to construct a new Air Traffic Control –cum-technical block, on the land to be acquired, at a cost of Rs. 100 crore. “Handing over of land will help the AAI start the expansion work immediately,” the Collector said. Underpass The Ministers had asked State Highways Department to expedite the work on preparing a detailed project report for the underpass to be constructed on the Inner Ring Road to enable extension of the runway over it. The Ministers plan to take up the issue of announcing Madurai airport as an international terminal with the Union Civil Aviation Minister. “While Coimbatore and Tiruchi airports enjoy the status of international airport, we are seeking the same for Madurai for the development of southern districts,” he said. Once the airport expansion works were completed, Madurai airport could not be denied the international terminal status. Besides, the very fact that repatriation flights were operated from several countries to Madurai during the lockdown only proved that Madurai airport had good demand for international flights on more routes, he added.

29 June 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||NHAI collects toll even for using ‘diverted route’||Even as National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has begun relaying of Madurai-Virudhunagar stretch of highway, it has invited the ire of road users for continuing to collect toll despite diverting vehicles through a ‘non-toll’ road in Tirumangalam. M. Balasubramanian, 39, of Sivakasi said that he was charged Rs. 85 at Kappalur toll plaza. “After hardly crossing 150 metres, the ‘toll road’ was closed and my car was diverted through Tirumangalam town,” he said. A civil engineer from Madurai, K. Kannapiran, 58, wondered why NHAI should collect toll for using only a 150-metre stretch of road. “I did not take a ‘toll road’ again after the diversion through Tirumangalam town as I was proceeding to T. Kallupatti. Instead of providing me a traffic-free good road, NHAI diverted me through busy Tirumangalam town with pedestrians, cattle and all types of vehicles, leading to exasperation. I did not pay toll for using this type of unsafe road,” he said. For two more days However, NHAI Project Director (in charge) K. Mathivanan said that as per the NHAI policy, the road users need to pay toll while passing through the toll plaza whenever renovation of road was undertaken. The diversion through Tirumangalam will continue for only two more days, he said. However, Mr. Kannapiran said that the NHAI should have diverted the vehicle through the other lane with proper temporary median as it was done near R.R. Nagar. After a part of rail overbridge at R.R. Nagar between Virudhunagar and Sattur collapsed in November 2020, the NHAI had blocked traffic on one side of the four-lane highway for nearly two km. “When NHAI can allow two-way traffic on one-way lane in Virudhunagar district for nearly eight months, why cannot the officials replicate it here too,” he asked.

The State government on Sunday night announced that these shops will be permitted in districts that fall under category 2. Owners of textile and jewellery shops in the city welcomed the relaxation of lockdown norms. Ashraf Tayub, secretary of Tamil Nadu Textile Merchants’ Association, said that the closure of shops for nearly 50 days had severe financial impact. With almost no income, the shopowners had to pay rent, electricity bill, GST, and had to pay their monthly loan dues to the banks. Besides, the owners had to pay salaries for their staff, said S. B. Senthil Kumar, Director of Balagopalan Jewellery Mart. “With the reopening of the shops, we are hoping that we can resume our sales to meet our overheads,” he added. Mr. Tayub said that on Monday, all textile shops thoroughly cleaned their premises until afternoon. “Dust had settled on the garments as the shops remained shut all these weeks. So, once the shops reopened, the owners had to clean the garments also,” he added. Although the government had mentioned that only 50% of the customers could be permitted in textile and jewellery shops, some of the shops were crowded. Moratorium Mr. Senthil Kumar said that moratorium was announced by the government during the lockdown of the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. “It will be very much helpful if the government announces moratorium this year too, for the benefit of the shop owners,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/textile-jewellery-shops-reopen/article35029099.ece

The Bench said it was the matter of policy of the government. The court was hearing the public interest litigation petition filed by Kaudeen of Pudukkottai district. He said that laptops were not provided to the students of Class XII of the 2017-18 batch. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the students needed the laptops to attend online classes. A Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice T.S. Sivagnanam observed, “The petitioner desires that students aged up to 17 should be entitled to supply of free laptops by the State. Indeed, we hope that the State has the resources to provide laptops to even toddlers as the newer generations appear to be adept at using gadgets almost from birth.” The court took cognisance of the counter affidavit filed by the District Educational Officer, Pudukkottai.

The new medical college which is accessible from both Nagapattinam-Sikkal and Nagapattinam-Velankanni roads will obviate the need for patients in the district to travel to the government medical college in neighbouring Tiruvarur district for speciality care.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-medical-college-at-orathur-all-set-for-first-batch-of-medical-students/article35029141.ece
29 June 2021||New Delhi,TAMIL NADU||Delhi HC quashes two cross FIRs in former MP’s matrimonial dispute||The Delhi High Court on Monday quashed two cross FIRs registered by former Rajya Sabha MP Sasikala Pushpa Ramaswamy and her husband Dr. B. Ramaswamy against each other following a matrimonial dispute, noting that they have amicably settled the issue. Justice C. Hari Shankar gave the direction after both Ms. Sasikala and Mr. Ramaswamy moved their respective applications seeking to close the FIRs as the dispute between them was settled. The couple told the High Court that they are now residing together after having undergone counselling and mediation. “In view of the above, no purpose would be served in continuing with these petitions. The petitions are disposed of in terms of the settlement arrived at between the parties. Needless to say, all parties shall be bound by the conditions of the settlement. As the dispute stands resolved, the FIRs are quashed,” Justice Shankar said. “The filing of these FIRs resulted in the premises of the persons being visited by the police. However, thereafter the disputes seem to have been satisfactorily resolved with the intervention of the Delhi government mediation and conciliation centre,” the High Court added. Ms. Sasikala and Mr. Ramaswamy had married in 2018. After she was expelled from the AIADMK in 2016, Ms. Sasikala joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

29 June 2021||Thanjavur,TAMIL NADU||AIIMS issue: Thanjavur residents feel slighted again||The Tamil Nadu government’s reported move to establish a second All India Institute of Medical Sciences hospital in the State in Coimbatore has come as a shock to residents of Thanjavur region. The Thanjavur District Makkal Nala Pervai,a forum floated by activists during 2014-15 to impress upon the Central and State governments to set up AIIMS hospital at the sprawling 205 acres near the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Tuberculosis and Chest Diseases Hospital complex at Sengipatti, has urged the State government to reconsider the decision. A resolution to this effect was adopted at the general body meeting chaired by its president, Thyagarajan, here on Sunday. Chief Minister M. K. Stalin during his visit to New Delhi recently has submitted a proposal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting an AIIMS hospital at Coimbatore in addition to the one already sanctioned at Thoppur, Madurai district, the Peravai said. Speaking to reporters here on Monday, the forum’s spokesperson, V. Jeevakumar said that already people in Cauvery Delta districts were dejected as the previous AIADMK government had failed to present the advantages in setting up of the AIIMS hospital at Sengipatti and the benefits it would bring to the people in this region in getting advanced medical treatment resulting in the Central team selecting the site at Thoppur near Madurai for setting up the centre of excellence in medical sciences. Now Coimbatore, which was not on the list of five places – Chengalpattu in Kancheepuram district, Sengipatti in Thanjavur district, Pudukottai in Pudukottai district, Perundurai in Erode district and Thoppur in Madurai district – identified for setting up of AIIMS hospital earlier, has suddenly emerged as the choice of the present DMK government for the second AIIMS hospital in the State, much to the shock of residents of Thanjavur district, he added. S. Muthukumar, a social activist, said that people in Delta districts already felt neglected as there was non-representation of their districts in the State Cabinet and the present move regarding AIIMS hospital facility has annoyed them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiims-issue-thanjavur-residents-feel-slighted-again/article35029142.ece

As per the announcement made by the State government, crew members of TNSTC that operates mofussil and city buses reported for duty at their respective bus depots and drove the buses to Central Bus Stand and Chathiram Bus Stand at 6 a.m. In Tiruchi zone comprising Tiruchi, Ariyalur and Perambalur districts, 80% of the buses were operated on Monday. A total of 735 buses were operated to different destinations in 27 districts, which were permitted by the State government. Buses were not operated to districts, where fresh cases of COVID-19 were still on a higher side. In central region, bus services were operated in Tiruchi, Ariyalur, Pudukottai and Perambalur districts as they were among the 27 districts permitted by the State government. But, buses were not operated beyond the borders of Thanjavur, Karur, Namakkal and Salem districts, where permission has not been given yet. Buses were operated up to Pettavaithalai on Tiruchi-Karur route, up to Meiakkalnaickenpatti. near Thottiyam on Tiruchi-Salem route, up to Vazhavanthankottai on Tiruchi-Thanjavur route, Mangampatti on Thuraiyur-Salem route and up to Pavithram on Thuraiyur-Namakkal route.

On Jayankondam-Kumbakonam route, buses were operated up to Anaikarai. Public patronage was rather poor on the first day of resumption of services. Though 50% occupancy was permitted, many buses were operated with just a few passengers. As against the average collection of Rs. 2,500 per trip between Tiruchi and Pudukottai, a TNSTC bus netted a collection of just Rs. 1,000 in the morning on Monday. Due to poor patronage, many bus crews were asked to forego the time schedule temporarily. Many buses were operated only after loading a minimum of 10 passengers. “Fear of contracting virus is palpable among the passengers. Many commute to their work places by their own vehicles. It will take at least two weeks for gaining the confidence of people travelling in public transports,” said R. Chellappa, a crew member of a bus plying between Tiruchi and Pudukottai.

29 June 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Private operators cautious||Amidst concerns over rising price of diesel, private bus operators (stage carriages) have decided to gradually resume services following the State government’s decision to allow public transport with 50% occupancy in 27 districts. About 4,500 private buses, all stage carriers, have permits to operate on mofussil and city routes across the State except in a few districts such as Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur. “Most private bus services will resume by July 1. Already a few operators have resumed services in some places. We will gradually resume services on getting the vehicles ready,” said D. R. Dharmaraj, secretary, Federation of Bus Operators Associations of Tamil Nadu. Private operators are hoping that public patronage will gradually improve over the coming days. “Many people have migrated to personal mode of transport during the lockdown and it will take some time for them to return to public transport,” Mr. Dharmaraj said. The federation has requested the government to exempt buses from road tax for the stoppage period (over the past two months) due to the lockdown meant to check the spread of COVID-19, Mr. Dharmaraj told The Hindu . Last year, the operators had got exemption from having to pay the road tax during the lockdown period. Meanwhile, the rising fuel price has got the private operators worried. “The price of diesel has gone above Rs. 93 a litre. It is going to be a challenge,” Mr. Dharmaraj observed. A section of private operators say that unless a fare revision is allowed it would be very difficult. However, they concede that it is a politically sensitive decision. “When we got the last fare revision in 2018, the price of diesel was Rs. 63 a litre. Now the fuel cost alone has gone up by Rs. 30 a litre. Given the restriction in occupancy, it will be a tough situation for us,” a private operator said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/private-operators-cautious/article35029157.ece

The official said that for inter-district bus movement, buses were not plied to the districts that fell under category 1. “Buses were operated for the districts in the other two categories.

29 June 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Kani tribe gets organic certification for produce||For the first time in the State, a tribal community has obtained organic certification for their farm produce, thanks to the efforts of Collector V. Vishnu. The tribe lives in Agasthiyar, Servalar, Chinna Mayilar and Periya Mayilar hamlets, all situated near Servalar and Papansam dams, and Injikuzhi area that is deep inside a dense forest 14 km beyond Papanasam dam. They have been cultivating a range of farm products for the past several decades using natural manure and pesticides without being able to reap the benefit of selling organic products. They grow lemon, banana, jack fruit, tapioca, cashew, coconut, green gram, pepper, pineapple, mango and almond and collect minor forest produce such as honey, amla , bay leaves, fig and jamun to be sold to customers visiting their hamlets. They strictly avoid using chemical fertilizers and harmful pesticides. However, the right price eluded the community due to lack of organic certification from competent bodies for the products. Things began to change for the better when the Collector met them on Monday last to hand over a mini-cargo vehicle for transportation of their farm produce to consumers on the plains. He promised to get them the much-needed certificate and that set the ball rolling. On behalf of Mayilar Kani Kudiyiruppu Eco Development Committee, an application seeking organic certification was submitted to National Programme for Organic Production Standards and Swiss Organic Farming Ordinance. Inspection Subsequently, Coimbatore-based Tamil Nadu Organic Certification Department inspected the place and products, and issued certification for a period of one year from June 25, 2021 to June 24, 2022. The validity of the certificate depends on continued compliance with the required standards and is subject to annual surveillance inspection. “It is a proud moment and great recognition for the uncompromising sincerity, integrity and hard work of the Kani people over all these decades. Now, 40 of their farm products will be available with organic certification, which will fetch them a better price,” said Mr. Vishnu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kani-tribe-gets-organic-certification-for-produce/article35029084.ece

The ground located close to the railway track was used as a dumping ground for the past few decades and it remained an eyesore for people using the subway. Recently, the Green Needa Environmental Club (GNEC) which is promoting ‘kurunkadu’ at two other places in Needamangalam Town Panchayat approached the owners of the site – the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment Department and the Southern Railway – with a proposal to transform the garbage dumping ground into a small dense forest area. “Our efforts elicited favourable response”, said the founder, GNEC, M. Rajavelu. Stating that it had been proposed to plant saplings of native tree varieties rich in generation of oxygen, he said that it has also been planned to involve students in the maintenance of the ‘kurunkadu’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/transforming-a-dumpyard/article35029148.ece

Dharmalingam Venugopal, honorary director of the NDC, in a release, said the State’s mountains and their resources were under multiple threats including real estate development, invasive species, monoculture, urbanisation leading to problematic man-animal interactions and power projects. “The State government has already notified the sensitive areas in the Western Ghats which are mostly mountain areas. It is time it formulates a comprehensive mountain policy for the sustainable development of its mountain resources,” said Mr. Venugopal in a letter to the Governor. Highlighting the case of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, which has enacted a law to protect mountain ecosystems by following the recommendations of the UN Mountain partnership, Mr. Venugopal appealed for the formulation of a similar law that would protect mountain environments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ndc-calls-for-mountain-policy-to-protect-biodiversity/article35028808.ece

Except for the Madurai resident from whom the sample was lifted after his death, the remaining nine have recovered from the infection. The Delta variant has caused widespread infection — 74% — during the second wave in the State. According to a report from the Health Department, a total of 1,159 samples were collected from all district surveillance units and sentinel sites and sent to the State Public Health Laboratory, Chennai, for preliminary screening, followed by referral to InStem, Bengaluru, for whole genome sequencing. The samples were lifted from the following categories — community clusters, family clusters, reinfection cases, vaccine breakthrough cases, children (aged up to 12), young adults with severe lung involvement, deceased without any co-morbidities and international travellers. Most common variant So far, the results of 1,110 samples were received. Preliminary findings showed that the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) emerged as the most common variant in 815 samples (74%), followed by the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) in 86 samples (8%). A total of 10 Delta Plus variant cases were reported. The analysis found that 83% of the Delta variant infections — 673 cases — were predominantly reported among adolescents and adults.

29 June 2021||June 29 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||CM urges Union Health Minister to allot more vaccines to govt. institutions||In total, 1.43 crore doses had so far been used in Tamil Nadu, of which private hospitals had administered only 6.5 lakh doses or just 4.5%. In June too, private institutions accounted for only 4.5 lakh doses (10%) of the 43.5 lakh doses administered across the State. “The above mismatch between demand and supply at government and private institutions has resulted in a situation wherein the private hospitals have around 7 lakh-8 lakh doses available with them, which is equivalent to the number of doses administered a month, whereas government institutions are left with just 2 lakh doses, which is lesser than their current single day usage. This can be rectified only by a more rational and performance-based distribution of available doses,” Mr. Stalin argued. Principal constraint The availability of vaccines had emerged as the principal constraint in the last few weeks, he contended, pointing out that the allotment to Tamil Nadu so far had been one of the lowest in terms of doses per thousand population. Recalling his request to the Union government for 1 crore doses, he said: “This has not been done, and the incremental increase in the allocation for June-July is just in line with the increases made available to other States that had got a higher allotment in the past and have already vaccinated more people.” While he acknowledged that the allotment of 25% of the vaccines produced to private hospitals might be to incentivise manufacturers by allowing them to sell a portion at a better price, Mr. Stalin said the need for a better-blended pricing “should not be allowed to undermine” the immediate goal of vaccinating the people at the maximum possible speed. “This can be achieved by increasing the allocation to performing government hospitals. It can be also ensured that the manufacturers are not affected by the reduction in their supply to private hospitals, if the Union government’s procurement price is increased to keep the blended price under the new policy the same as the current one,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cm-urges-union-health-minister-to-allot-more-vaccines-to-govt-institutions/article35028764.ece

29 June 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Former MLA quarrels with policemen who try to serve him arrest warrant||The former MLA Vijayanand Kashappanavar picked up a quarrel with police officers who went to serve him an arrest warrant in Hungund in Bagalkot district on Sunday. The police personnel from Hungund had reached his house with an arrest warrant from a Bengaluru-based Special Court for disputes related to elected representatives. Officers also told him that the warrant was for a bailable offence and he could seek legal opinion about moving ahead with the case. However, the Congress leader did not accept this. He argued that the police had come to his house to arrest him in the pretext of a warrant. Mr. Kashappanavar also accused them of rushing to his house, by falsely claiming that a neighbour had called them about some altercation in the Kashappanavar household. ‘Playing politics’ The former MLA also accused the police of playing politics over the case. He said that they were acting on the orders of his political rival MLA and BJP leader Doddanagouda Patil. “I know that you have not come here to serve the warrant. You have come here because Doddanagouda [Patil] has sent you,” he said. The police officers did not accept this. They said that they had rushed to the house as they got a call from a resident of the area about loud noise arising out of heated arguments. “We will respond as swiftly when anyone calls us. It does not matter who calls us,’’ one of the officers said. The officer said that he was willing to share the number that had given the information to the police and asked a relative of Mr. Kashappanavar to call back the person and cross check. However, the Congress leader did not agree. “We will not call anyone. Now that you have come here to arrest me, you go ahead and arrest me. I will see what happens,” he said. He sat on his chair and did not move. The police repeatedly clarified to him that the purpose behind their visit was not to arrest him, but only to serve the copy of a bailable warrant. The police left after a few minutes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/former-mla-quarrels-with-policemen-who-try-to-serve-him-arrest-warrant/article35028908.ece
29 June 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Frequent travellers find it difficult to cross border||A Government Order making it mandatory for travellers from Maharashtra to carry a COVID-19 negative report has created confusion among residents in the the district and frequent travellers. As per the order, all those who cross the border should carry a RT-PCR negative certificate. Those who don’t have them, should get tested at the sample collection centres set up on the border. Deputy Commissioner M.G. Hiremath visited the Kognoli checkpost on Saturday and inspected the centre. He said that the rule of no entry without certificate or test, is being enforced strictly to prevent a third wave, if any. He asked officers to stop all vehicles using on the highway and check for certificates. This applies to those who will pass through Karnataka, to reach other Southern States. Transport vehicles will be allowed after thermal scanning of the driver, the Deputy Commissioner said. However, this has caused confusion among frequent travellers. Some commuters say officers are only testing those travelling by car and motorcycles and not those on buses. “I have seen that the check-post officials just go around asking if everyone is carrying a certificate and then allow buses to travel. But for those going by car, they ask us to get down and show our certificates,’’ said Ranjeet Kale, a businessman. Shivraj Patil, who works for a foodgrains trading company, said that the rules are difficult to obey as each certificate is valid only for three days. “People like me travel between Kolhapur and Belagavi two or three times a week. How many times are we supposed to get ourselves tested?” he asked. Anees Mohammad, a private bank employee, pointed out that the rule is being enforced strictly for passenger vehicles, but not for goods vehicles. “Drivers and cleaners of goods vehicles are allowed to go after their temperature is recorded using thermal scanners. No one asks them for certificates,’’ he said. Mr. Hiremath said that the existing rules will be enforced till the government revises them.

Yediyurappa on Monday requested his Kerala counterpart Pinarayi Vijayan not to change the names of 11 villages in Kasaragod and Manjeshwara taluks in Kasaragod district, which abuts Karnataka. “The Kerala government may not have the intention to change the names of these villages and this may have been a unilateral decision of the local bodies of these villages,” Mr. Yediyurappa said in a letter to Mr. Vijayan. “I hope you will oblige and make the Kannada-speaking people of Kasaragod and Manjeshwara happy by taking a decision to stall the process of changing the names,” he stated. Mr. Yediyurappa said that the existing names were predominantly from Kannada and Tulu. “Some of the names of these villages have a long history of several centuries,” he said, adding that the change of names would hurt the Kannada-speaking people and destroy Kannada and Tulu culture. Karnataka Border Area Development Authority chairman C. Somashekar had met the Chief Minister earlier to discuss the issue and urged him to take up the matter with Mr. Vijayan. Opposing the move to rename the villages, Kannada and Culture Minister Arvind Limbavali said the government should have at least discuss the issue with the local population before making any announcement. The decision to change names of villages has also been opposed by Minister for Primary and Secondary Education S. Suresh Kumar. “The name of every village and town will have its own history,” he said. JD(S) leader and former Chief Minister H.D.

29 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Flower garden has been a ‘gangster haven’ for two decades||Flower garden, the area under Cottonpet limits which recently saw the brutal murder of former councillor Rekha Kadiresh in broad daylight, has a two-decade history of bloody gang wars and murders, raising questions about police action to contain crime in the area. Though the police acted swiftly in the former councillor’s murder case and arrested the accused, the gruesome crime has caused considerable embarrassment to the police as the area, situated behind Vinayaka Theatre on Mysuru Road, is surrounded by four police stations. This includes the CCB head office with the Organised Crime Wing, which has been accused of failing to contain rowdy activities in its backyard . Admitting failure on their part, a senior police officer, on condition of anonymity, said that the murder of Rekha Kadiresh was hard to prevent as family members were involved. However, the police failed to notice the growing resentment between Rekha and others due to a weak intelligence network and improper documentation, which is basic to keep tabs on anti-social elements and gangs. Another significant factor is that the police revoked the rowdy-sheet against Peter - the accused - in 2018 despite there being half a dozen cases of murder, robbery and assault pending against him. After the death of Kadiresh, Rekha kept Peter away and did not support him financially. Upset about this, Peter got into his old drug peddling business to eke out a living before he was offered the job, allegedly by Mala, to eliminate Rekha, a police officer, said. With Rekha’s murder and Peter’s arrest, the police are going to reopen the rowdy sheet against him. The flower garden area, with pockets such as Anjinappa Garden, Bhakshi Garden, Binny Mill, Peer Boundary, Tipunagar and Anandapura, has been dominated by gangs for the last two decades, running drug peddling and illicit liquor business. It started in 2000 with Alaimani, a notorious gangster who was killed in an encounter for a series of robberies, rapes and peddling. However, despite having knowledge and documentation of every gang and gangster, the police have not been able to prevent crimes in the area, it is alleged. The police have now stepped up security in the area following the recent murder. Mala and Arul in custody Meanwhile, the West Division police have taken Mala, Kadiresh’s sister and her son Arul into custody till July 2 to probe in detail about the reason behind the gruesome murder of Rekha Kadiresh in front of her office on Thursday. Mala and Arul are prime accused in the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/flower-garden-has-been-a-gangster-haven-for-two-decades/article35028693.ece
29 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BBMP takes up exercise to identify pockets not covered by vaccination||To ensure maximum coverage of vaccination, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has taken up an exercise to identify uncovered pockets. Speaking to reporters here on Monday, BBMP’s chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta said that the door-to-door survey that had already begun would help the civic body identify citizens who are yet to be vaccinated and the reasons for the same. “We are preparing a list of such persons and the areas/ localities they live in. The reasons for not getting vaccinated could vary from no primary health centre (PHC) nearby and access to vaccination possible only through BBMP’s outreach. We will conduct special vaccination camps in such uncovered pockets,” he said. The civic body, he told The Hindu , was also in touch with community leaders, slum dwellers’ associations, and others to ensure that no eligible citizen is left out of the vaccination drive. “Already, as per our estimates, around 50% of the adult population in the city has been vaccinated. We are working to increase this number further with camps in uncovered pockets. Private healthcare institutions have tied up with factories, apartments, residents’ welfare associations and private vaccination camps are also held across the city,” he said, and added that the civic body is focusing on vaccinating those in the 18 to 44 age group, belonging to 30 different categories identified by the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bbmp-takes-up-exercise-to-identify-pockets-not-covered-by-vaccination/article35028683.ece
29 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Verification of pensioners done at their doorstep using app’||The State government on Monday told the High Court of Karnataka that senior citizens eligible for various pension schemes of the State are not required to visit either banks or government offices for verification or to produce life certificate as these steps are done at their doorstep by the village accountants using a mobile app called Navodaya. The government also told the court that during entire period of last year’s lockdown and thereafter, eligible senior citizen pensioners were not asked to produce life certificate and the pension amount was transferred to their bank accounts through the Direct Benefit Transfer method. A statement in this regard was made before a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindara during the hearing of a PIL petition filed by Akhila Karnataka Vyyovrudhara Okkoota, an organisation working for the social security of the elderly in the State. The verification of pensioners, including under the old-age pension and Sandhya Suraksha schemes, is done at their doorstep and their photo and details of existence done through the mobile app by village accountants, the government stated. “The State, in fact, has disbursed the entire pension amount liable to be paid to all senior citizens in Karnataka up to the month of May 2021, and there is no due of pension payable,” Deputy Director of Social Security and Pension Department stated in an affidavit submitted to the court. Meanwhile, the Bench directed the government to submit its response on the court’s earlier query on extending priority benefits to senior citizens, including treatment for COVID-19, under the provisions of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/verification-of-pensioners-done-at-their-doorstep-using-app/article35028696.ece
29 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Govt. considering decentralised approach to reopening schools||Instead of a uniform policy for reopening schools across the State, the Karnataka government is contemplating having a decentralised system where the decision will be based on the local circumstances. A final decision will be subject to the recommendation made by the task force which has been set up to suggest measures for reopening schools. The online classes, however, will commence from July 1. “The task force will be set up in a couple of days and will have subject experts, members of the Technical Advisory Committee, and experts on children issues. Once the report of the task force is received, a decision will be made,” Minister for Primary and Secondary Education S. Suresh Kumar told presspersons here on Monday. Besides the opening of schools, several decisions, including the reintroduction of the Vidyagama programme, will be taken based on the task force recommendations, he added. Indicating that the State syllabus could also move towards the periodic assessments, on the lines of the CBSE, Mr. Suresh Kumar said, “We now have to think beyond the annual exam scheme and towards having periodic assessment.” Meanwhile, as the online classes commence on July 1, recorded programmes on DD Chandana channel will be available for students. More than 22,000 pieces of audio and video lessons are already available on the e-Daksh portal. A survey last year had found that 39% of students in Karnataka did not have any kind of access to a mobile/computer device to continue their education in the online mode. “It is a big challenge and a majority of those without access to a device are in rural areas. To contact them, we have started a mentor system,” the Minister said. “We will explore new possibilities to ensure children do not miss out on education.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-considering-decentralised-approach-to-reopening-schools/article35028708.ece

29 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Shivaram Karanth Layout: Two help desks to be reopened from July 1||Two of four help desks, temporarily closed after the second wave, will be opened from July 1, said former judge A.V. Chandrashekar, who is heading the committee looking into lawful constructions made on the land notified for formation of Shivaram Karanth Layout. Applications will be received by following COVID-19 related protocols, he added on Monday. He has asked the building owners who built the structures before August 3, 2018 in the notified area to come forward and submit the documents at Medi Agrahara and Somashettihalli. The remaining two help desks will be opened in the coming days. “We have received 3,500 applications. In the coming days, we are likely to receive 2,000 to 2,500 more. If Kodihalli Chandrashekar had not spread misinformation about the layout, we could have completed the process. He had claimed of getting an assurance from the State government that the layout would not be formed. It was misleading and caused confusion among the public. Based on the committee report, the Supreme Court has already issued a contempt of court notice against him. The BDA too has filed a case against him,” Mr. Chandrashekar said. “Now, more people are willing to submit documents. The documents submitted by the building owners are secure. We will scrutinise these documents, if required we will also make spot inspection. There is a plan to submit a preliminary report on the existing applications,” he said. Mr. Chandrashekar told presspersons that in its recent order, the Supreme Court had told the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) not to acquire layouts which were approved and sanctioned before August 3, 2018 in the notified area. He added that as per the court’s direction, people who had formed such layouts can furnish documents through help desks and which will be later scrutinised by the committee. “We have also sought information from the BDA on layouts which were approved legally prior to August 3, 2018. A report will be submitted on the legally sanctioned layouts to the Court by August,” he said, adding that the SC order to BDA not to acquire legally built layouts in the notified area is a big relief for the property owners, those living in high-rise buildings, and others who had purchased sites in these layouts and built houses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/shivaram-karanth-layout-two-help-desks-to-be-reopened-from-july-1/article35028685.ece

In a release, Kodihalli Chandrashekhar, State president of both organisations, said that under the new scheme, claims would be possible only if there is a mention in the RTC about the particular crop being grown by the farmer. He expressed concern that such a rider may go against farmers while making claims as there have been instances of officials getting it wrong while mentioning crops in the RTC. Also, it is mandatory for farmers to file different application for enrolling under the insurance scheme for different RTCs, as against the earlier scheme where a single application was enough. Pointing out that June 30 was the last date to enrol under the crop insurance scheme, he expressed fear that many farmers might miss the deadline.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/new-insurance-scheme-is-not-farmer-friendly/article35028706.ece

The State government has instructed the administration to strengthen checkposts on the borders with Kerala in the district. Hence, checkposts at prominent border entry points such as Talapady, Jalsoor, Saradkka and Nettanige-Mudnur have been strengthened. Dr. Rajendra said that the test positivity rate in Dakshina Kannada is hovering around 5% while it was at 10% in the neighbouring Kasaragod district in Kerala. Hence, preventive steps will have to be taken to contain the spread of a possible third wave in the district. Gram Panchayats and Revenue officials on the border areas have been alerted and have been asked to strengthen checking passengers entering from Kerala. People will have to cooperate during checking, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/covid-19-negative-test-certificate-must-for-entry-from-kerala/article35028916.ece
29 June 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||‘Seek Rs. 100 crore from Centre to deal with sea erosion’||Home Minister and in-charge of Udupi district Basavaraj Bommai on Monday asked the district administration to prepare a proposal to seek Rs. 100 crore as special compensation from the Union government to address sea erosion issues. Speaking at a review meeting in Udupi, the Minister said that Cyclone Tauktae and other factors have resulted in 9,115 m of coastal area eroding causing more than Rs. 90 crore loss. A special compensation will have to be sought to take up a project to prevent sea erosion permanently. The Home Minister said that a full-fledged team of State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) will be sanctioned for the district. The Minister said that the government will take up a programme “Vatsalya” to conduct a comprehensive health check for 2.40 lakh children in the district. The initiative is to prevent the third wave, if any, of COVID-19. The administration should complete the health check before August 15. After conducting the health check, malnourished children should be given nutrition kits and free medicine. Those who required treatment should be treated at the government health facilities. If some treatment facilities are not available in government hospitals, such children should be admitted to private hospitals and their treatment cost should be borne under Ayushman scheme. The government will make necessary amendments in the guidelines of Ayushman scheme to enable all children to avail themselves of free treatment at private hospitals under the scheme, he said. The Minister said that the Health Department should ensure that 2.5 lakh persons are vaccinated every month and that all eligible persons should be vaccinated in the next four months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/seek-rs-100-crore-from-centre-to-deal-with-sea-erosion/article35028914.ece

29 June 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Lower TPR coincides with rise in testing in Mysuru||The reduction in Test Positivity Rate (TPR) in Mysuru, which helped the district become eligible for certain relaxations in lockdown restrictions from June 26, appears to have come about through a decrease in the number of daily COVID-19 infections and a substantial increase in testing. When the State government began a phased unlocking of COVID-19 restrictions from June 14 across Karnataka, Mysuru was among 11 districts with a high TPR, where the restrictions were continued. A weekly moving average TPR of less than 10% was necessary for districts to become eligible for partial unlocking, and a TPR of less than 5% for additional relaxations. When the second phase of unlocking was announced from June 21, with a TPR of 12.11%, Mysuru was the only district to be classified as Category III not eligible for any relaxations. However, Mysuru became eligible for unlocking, albeit partially, on June 25 when its weekly moving average TPR was 7.42% as per the State COVID-19 War Room report of June 25. Incidentally, Mysuru’s TPR on June 25 was lesser than Kodagu’s 8.55%, which was the highest in the State. The gradual reduction in daily infections was complemented by efforts of the district administration to achieve the targeted TPR by increasing swab collection and testing amid pressure from the trade and services sector for relaxation of restrictions. While the weekly cases in Mysuru dipped from 8,281 (four weeks ago) to 6,436 (three weeks ago), before coming down to 3,977 two weeks ago and to 3,214 last week, the number of daily tests saw a substantial increase over the last one month. From just 3,500 to 4,000 tests per day during May, the daily tests were increased to around 5,000 to 6,000 in the first week of June. Last week, the district administration revised its daily target for testing to 9,700 even as health officials struggled to gather the necessary number of swab samples needed to meet the target. While announcing the partial easing of lockdown in Mysuru on June 25, Deputy Commissioner Bagadi Gautham claimed that the daily testing had crossed 10,000.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/lower-tpr-coincides-with-rise-in-testing-in-mysuru/article35028689.ece

It is in view of Delta variant found and more COVID-19 cases prevailing in Kerala, Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra and Kodagu DHO Mohan announced this in separate statements. “Travellers from Kerala cannot enter Karnataka either through Kutta or Makutta border check posts in Kodagu if they don’t have an RT-PCR negative report. Also, we are randomly carrying out a rapid antigen test (RAT) at both checkposts as a containment measure,” said Dr. Mohan. Checking of travellers at the entry points from Kerala has been intensified since Sunday. Dr. Mohan said RATs are also done on those carrying RT-PCR negative reports. At Mangaluru, Dr. Rajendra said that if the travellers failed to produce the negative certificate they will be subjected to testing at the border check posts from Tuesday by collecting the swabs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/covid-19-test-report-must-for-travellers-from-kerala/article35028680.ece

29 June 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Fresh trouble brewing for Water Metro||Even as the rolling out of the first Water Metro ferry has overshot its revised deadline by over six months, fresh trouble is brewing for Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL), as heritage enthusiasts have yet again objected to the construction of a jetty near the iconic Chinese fishing nets that dot the Fort Kochi beachfront. A row of three heritage buildings located behind the nets — on land owned by the Cochin Port Trust — had been demolished in December 2020 to create space for the Water Metro’s Fort Kochi jetty, despite fiery opposition from heritage enthusiasts and conservation architects. “KMRL still insists on building a jetty between two Chinese nets at the harbour mouth, despite safety implications,” said former Mayor K.J. Sohan, who is the convener of INTACH - Kerala, a heritage body that recently filed complaints before the Archaeology Department, following which works to commence the Water Metro’s jetty construction were halted. “The complaint was made because the plea by NGOs, heritage bodies, and others to redevelop the unused tourist and Kochi Corporation jetties at Kamalakadavu, located only 250 metres away, close to the bus stand, fell on deaf ears. Apart from ensuring the safety of ferries, substantial funds can be saved if the existing jetties are put to proper use, rather than put commuters at the mercy of tidal variations and undercurrents at the harbour mouth,” he said. The construction of the Water Metro jetty at Mattancherry too has been embroiled in delays, despite KMRL saying that ferries would operate on the Ernakulam-West Kochi route after operations begin on the Vyttila-Kakkanad stretch. KMRL sources said efforts were on to overcome issues that had delayed the construction of jetty terminals, including at Fort Kochi and Mattancherry, although the agency received a stop memo in this regard. The Water Metro’s Operational Control Centre next to its Vyttila jetty too has not been completed, over four months since the inauguration of the Rs. 747-crore project’s first route (to Kakkanad).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fresh-trouble-brewing-for-water-metro/article35029015.ece
29 June 2021||Kochi,KERALA||‘Coconut’ protest sweeps Lakshadweep||Residents of Lakshadweep on Monday staged “coconut leaves and palm” protest across inhabited islands against the administration’s order to levy a fine if coconut palm leaves, shells or trunks were found in and around their dwelling places. Holding placards which read “introduce mulching” and “stop imposing fine”, the islanders, under the banner of Save Lakshadweep Forum (SLF), stood in front of a pile of coconut leaves in the properties urging the administration to withdraw the “anti-people” order. In their one-hour long protest, the islanders urged the administration to withdraw the decision to impose fine on them and introduce technology to convert the organic materials from the coconuts as compost -- a mixture of ingredients used to fertilize and improve the soil. “Our demand is that the fine imposed on the people should be withdrawn and a proper waste management system should be implemented. Unless the waste management system is implemented there is no genuine right from the side of administration to collect fine on falling of coconut leaves and other palms in their property,” Lakshadweep MP Mohammed Faizal P P told PTI. “Where do the people of islands are expected to do the scientific processing of leaves and palms,” he asked. Prime duty The Lok Sabha member said an islander cannot afford to have his own scientific processing unit or incinerator and it is the prime duty of the Lakshadweep administration to provide such a facility. “If such facilities are made available and people are not obeying this, then you can impose the fine,” Mr. Faizal said. In the order issued on June 4 on management of cleanliness and hygiene in the islands in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, the administration has said each family of individuals who stay in any premise shall maintain cleanliness with certain standards and hygiene in and around their respective places at all times. It said tender coconut shells, tree leaves, coconut husks, trunks etc in and around dwelling places/public places must be disposed off scientifically by the landowners without affecting hygiene to the environment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/coconut-protest-sweeps-lakshadweep/article35029018.ece

29 June 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Pandemic clips poultry sector’s wings||Reeling under COVID-19 restrictions and rock-bottom sales, the poultry sector in the State has now been severely affected by shortage of feed. Farm gate chicken price dropped to around Rs. 60 a kg on Saturday, while the farmer’s production cost is around Rs. 100, said S.K. Nazeer, general secretary, All Kerala Poultry Federation. Until the business normalises, tens of thousands of poultry farmers will see little or no income, he said, claiming that the sector provided jobs to around five lakh people. However, around 70% of them are out of work, as they are unable to sell the birds at remunerative prices, while the production cost is high mostly due to expensive feed and shortage of supplies. Mr. Nazeer said a pre-lockdown account for chicken sales stood around 22 lakh kg a day in the State, with some districts accounting for 2.5 to three lakh kg of sales. Nearly 50% of the sales went to catering and hotel enterprises. Incidentally, the lockdown has completely or partially closed eateries. Moreover, cancellation of weddings and other functions has speeded up the fall in sales, he added. Kerala Poultry Farmers Association State president Baiju Kadavan said along with feed shortage and fall in sales due to pandemic restrictions, others like high cost of electricity had added to the burden of farmers. He added that the electricity bill for a small farm had gone up from Rs. 500 to Rs. 3,000. According to him, poultry farmers should be able to fix the prices of birds and called for a government initiative to encourage bird rearing and sales on the lines of Milma. Mr. Kadavan said his recent experience had been chicken being sold at Rs. 83 a kg in the retail market, while the production cost was in the same range. Farmers are unable to get a price to support the business, he added. K.K. Ramanan of Kerala Poultry Farmers Association from Edakkattuvayal in Ernakulam, which was once renowned for its poultry farms, said he had given up the business owing to difficulties in maintaining it. He added that most farms at Edakkattuvayal had shut down operations for various reasons. A senior scientist associated with the poultry sector said there was no major poultry feed production unit in Kerala. The steep rise in the cost of edible oil has triggered the rise in feed price, Mr. Nazeer said, adding that the cost of feed had gone up to Rs. 2,000 per 50 kg bag this week from the previous level of around Rs. 1,500. Besides, supplies have dwindled severely.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pandemic-clips-poultry-sectors-wings/article35029003.ece

In a special drive named Operation Pathway, focus was given to haphazardly parked vehicles that obstructed the ‘right of way’ of other motorists and pedestrians, Ernakulam RTO P.M. Shabeer said. The drive will continue in a sustained manner, as per a directive of the Kerala High Court, to ensure smooth and safe movement of road users. E-challan cases are being registered against rule violators, including those who drive through footpaths. The e-challan along with a photo of the rule violation will be sent to the addresses of vehicle owners, the officer said. Motor Vehicle Department (MVD) squads have also been taking action against vehicles that block free left turns and those parked atop pedestrian crossing lines. This is apart from cases registered against those who put up posters or hoardings that distracted drivers’ attention and other obstructions that created safety hazards on roads and footpaths. This too was based on a HC directive. “In this instance, our teams did a safety audit of many roads and found numerous instances of electric and overhead cable posts and even transformers that dangerously protruded into the carriageway of roads. The agencies concerned were informed of them,” Mr. Shabeer added. Similarly, the MVD has resumed enforcement drive against vehicles with sun films, opaque stickers on front and rear lights, and illegally-altered vehicles.

29 June 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Buy farm fresh veggies, pay what you want||A shop ‘selling’ garden-fresh vegetables, without a cashier or anyone attending to the ‘buyers,’ has become the toast of Koonammavu, a small town at Kottuvally panchayat near Kochi. Opened about 75 days ago by the enterprising residents of the St. Joseph’s boys’ hostel in the town, the shop is actually not a shop, nor does it sell. The venue just displays fresh produce from a four-acre vegetable farm cultivated by the youngsters, says Father Sangeeth Joseph, who heads the hostel. The hostel is home to about 50 youngsters, aged between eight and 21, either from families of single parents or families that have split up, says Fr. Joseph from the Varappuzha archdiocese of the Catholic Church. Those coming to the ‘shop’ can pick up the vegetables or bananas they want. They can either put some money in a bottle kept on the counter or they can leave without paying. The inspiration The initiative, inspired by a Catholic priest Father Bobby Jose, is being implemented under the leadership of 18-year-old Arun and 16-year-old Godwin, both residents of the hostel. Fr. Jose was instrumental in setting up a hotel in Tripunithura on the same principle. One can eat and have tea or coffee at the ‘Capuchin Mess’ and pay what one likes or not pay at all, no questions asked. “The idea is to eschew commercialisation. It is more than selling, it is sharing the fruits of one’s labour,” adds Fr. Joseph. The Koonammavu boys’ hostel residents also rear 15 cows and the milk is sold to around 50 families in the town. Those who come to buy milk from the dairy farm on the hostel premises book the vegetables too in advance. At times, the vegetables are delivered home, along with the milk, by the boys.  Inspired by the success of their first venture, the youngsters are now planning to cultivate the salt-resistant Pokkali variant of paddy in about 10 acres of field near Koonammavu. The field was being prepared for the purpose, said an official of the Agriculture Department on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/buy-farm-fresh-veggies-pay-what-you-want/article35029025.ece

In the petition, they said they wanted to visit the island to understand the current situation and hear grievances of people. Though they had approached the Administrator for an entry permit, they were asked to postpone their visit. The petitioners said they were denied permission because the Administrator wanted to hide his ‘oppressive and arbitrary actions.’ In fact, the Administrator had visited the island and returned without complying with the COVID-19 protocol. The administration had allowed a foreign national to enter the island. The foreigner was still staying there. The action of the Administrator in denying them entry permits was arbitrary and unconstitutional, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mps-move-hc-for-permit/article35029016.ece

Kappan split on Monday with a section of its leaders announcing their decision to leave the outfit. The dissident leaders led by Babu Karthikeyan, former State treasurer of the NCP, attributed their resignations to the shifting political priorities of Mr. Kappan after the Assembly elections. ‘A return to LDF’ They also accused him of attempting a return to the NCP fold and thereby to the Left Democratic Front. “The meeting that Mr. Kappan held with the NCP leaders in Mumbai soon after the Assembly elections and his recent statements against the United Democratic Front point to a gradual shift in his priorities,” alleged Mr. Karthikeyan. The Kappan faction sought to brush aside the allegations. “Since the party is yet to get a registration by the Election Commission of India, how can one resign from a non-existent organisation?,” asked Kadakampally Suku, a party leader. ECI refusal According to him, the ECI has dismissed the party’s application for registration as Nationalist Congress Kerala (NCK) and in turn asked it to consider three alternative names.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kappan-faction-sees-a-split/article35029027.ece

The issue has drawn the attention of the Kerala State Human Rights Commission, which has directed the office of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) in Kozhikode to solve it and submit a report to the Commission within four weeks. Crew of trucks parked under the flyover often cook their food nearby and abandon waste, including plastic, wherever they camp. As a result, plastic and other waste are now spread across the area beneath the flyover. Truck parking under the flyover started recently as parking has been banned on South Beach. The Kozhikode Municipal Corporation is yet to make an alternative arrangement for the parking of trucks. Though the Thondayad area comes under the corporation, there is a jurisdiction problem as the flyover comes under the National Highways Authority. Dumping of waste along the bypass from passing vehicles has given a constant headache to the corporation authorities. The civic body had organised several mass cleaning drives over the years to clear non-biodegradable waste from the sides of the bypass. Local residents have been complaining about waste dumping under the flyover and along the road from Thondayad to Malapparamba. The inaction of the authorities during lockdown has added to the problem. There has been a suggestion to use the area under the flyover for paid car parking. The Human Rights Commission will take stock of the situation in its next sitting in Kozhikode.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/panel-pulls-up-nhai-as-space-beneath-flyover-turns-a-dump/article35028995.ece

District Collector S. Sambasiva Rao in an order said arrangements would have to be made in health centres for the purpose. The district medical officer had been asked to deploy doctors and other health workers from community health centres or first-line treatment centres. Services of doctors and other staff in mobile medical units should be utilised. Secretaries in local bodies can appoint doctors on daily wages and also depend on those in private hospitals if there is a need. Local bodies should relieve teachers chosen for online classes or for exams by June 30. All the staff should come to work in local bodies. Mr. Rao said that pandemic protocol should be followed during weddings, funerals and other private events. He pointed out that tracing of contacts of infected persons should be intensified in local bodies such as Puthuppady, Onchiyam, Thurayoor, Atholi, Perumanna, and Peruvayal grama panchayats as well as Vadakara Municipality where test positivity rate (TPR) is high. Meanwhile, 779 fresh cases of the infection were reported in the district on Monday, of which 759 were through local transmission. The source of 17 others was not known. Kozhikode Corporation accounted for 214 locally acquired infections. As many as 7,222 samples were tested and the daily TPR is 10.98%.

The police nabbed him from Uttar Pradesh after a three-month-long inquiry into the incident. With this, four out of the five suspects in the banking fraud have been netted. The accused who is still at large is a north Indian youth who allegedly helped the other accused tap ATM card details using skimmers. Police sources said it was the arrest of Sugeeth Varma, the prime accused in the case, from New Delhi that brought to light a clear picture about the inter-State fraud. He had received the technical support of two engineering graduates from Kozhikode’s Villiappally for securing and decoding skimmer data from various ATMs on payment of commission. “It was on March 31 that the two local youths from Villiappally were arrested, making a breakthrough in the investigation. The two had maintained a close social media contact with the prime accused. Nearly Rs. 6 lakh had been withdrawn from various places using the tapped details of multiple bank accounts,” said an official from the Vadakara station. According to him, they had the ATM card details of over 100 persons from Kozhikode district. The majority of complaints related to the illegal fund withdrawal took place between February and March this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/second-accused-in-atm-fraud-case-nabbed-from-up/article35029000.ece
29 June 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Former NIT-C students develop online classroom app||A web-based app developed by former students of the National Institute of Technology- Calicut (NIT-C) during the lockdown is slowly getting popular with presence in five countries, including the United States. Offering immense possibilities in the digital world, Lesson21 (www.lesson21.com) provides a user-friendly interface with online classroom, laboratories and chat rooms all under one roof. “Unlike Moodle, which is a learning management system, Lesson21 uses its own tools, even customised versions, enabling teachers and students to interact in real-time and get a classroom-like experience,” Rahul Sebastian, one of the creators of the virtual e-learning platform, says. The 26-year-old B.Tech mechanical production graduate says that an education technical platform was originally conceived along with his two friends Manhar Musafir and Hashtif Habeeb as a humble venture to assist a few teachers struggling to cope with the online teaching mode last year. “Now, after getting investments from a Canada-based firm, we secured an office at the Technopark in Thiruvananthauram,” Mr. Sebastian says. At present, over 10,000 students in India, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Qatar are using the e-learning application that facilitates coordination among teachers, students, and parents. The salient features of the application are that it provides in-built facilities for assignments, discussions and examinations. Files and assessment of the students can be retained in the server. "The basic version is free in India," he says. Apart from the basic features, Mr. Sebastian says that Lesson21 supports many other features including video classrooms exclusively for educational purposes. "The virtual labs are developed in such a way that students can perform science experiments in a game-like fashion. The platform also offers a curated content library that has a wide variety of e-books and personalised videos," he says. A professional Kanban board (a tool to manage work at an organisational level), sharing of assignments, quizzes and large files are also part of this platform. "A white label platform that can be fully customised has also been integrated in the application." Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning recommendations are added to the platform which can demonstrate the functioning of a school e-pictorially or graphically," Mr. Sebastian says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/former-nit-c-students-develop-online-classroom-app/article35028993.ece

29 June 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Final-year degree exams begin||Numerous students returned to colleges after over three months as three universities in the State commenced the final-year examinations for undergraduate courses on Monday. The offline examinations got under way despite a section of the student community demanding their postponement or cancellation in view of the COVID-19 situation. The students of the colleges affiliated to the University of Kerala, Mahatma Gandhi University and the University of Calicut flocked to the examination centres in sizeable numbers. Official sources said well over 90% students appeared for their examinations. Barring a few complaints, the first day of examinations passed smoothly. Fee payment issues A few colleges reportedly prevented the students who failed to pay fees from writing the examinations. However, following government intervention, the managements issued such students special hall-tickets shortly before the start of the examinations. Adhering to the COVID-19 protocol, the colleges permitted the entry of students into the campuses after conducting temperature checks using thermal scanners. Faculty members also took up the responsibility of preventing crowding on the campuses. COVID-19 protocol committees were formed for the purpose. Suma S., associate professor and college union adviser at Government College for Women, Thiruvananthapuram, said examination rooms were allotted to groups of 20 to 22 students to ensure adequate spacing. Students from containment zones and those undergoing quarantine were allotted separate rooms. The police intervened in certain areas to prevent crowding of parents outside the examination centres. The universities have scheduled their examinations in a staggered manner to minimise the possibility of crowding.  With the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation yet to resume their services in full swing, several students reached colleges much earlier than their reporting time. Rahul P., a student from Vithura, said the lack of bus services prompted many students to rely on the few buses that plied along the routes. To alleviate the woes of such students, the universities had permitted them to opt for examination centres close to their native places. Universities also identified centres outside their jurisdictions. The University of Kerala is conducting the examinations in 11 centres outside its jurisdiction. But, not all students have availed themselves of the facility. PG exams The postgraduate (PG) examinations in these universities and the final-year examinations of the University of Kannur will get under way on Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/final-year-degree-exams-begin/article35029013.ece
29 June 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Focus shifts to fatality reduction among high-risk groups||The second wave of COVID-19 in the State, fuelled by the Delta virus variant, saw a steep rise in the number of COVID deaths. With speculation rife about the pace and intensity of a possible third wave in the State, the Health Department has decided to turn its attention towards those at the highest risk of mortality, amongst the vulnerable groups in the population. “The huge number of deaths amongst COVID-positive pregnant women was something we seemed to have no control over during the second wave. Between March-June over 40 mothers-to-be died in Kerala. COVID also claimed the lives of many with uncontrolled diabetes, chronic kidney disease, malignancy or haematological disorders. We need targetted interventions to reduce the COVID-related mortality amongst these categories ahead of the third wave,” says R. Aravind, Head of Infectious Diseases, Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram COVID-positive patients presenting late at hospitals with the onset of hypoxia was a major issue that complicated patient care during the second wave. The sheer volume of patients meant that the State was forced to keep most of them in home care or at first-line treatment centres. Lacuna in home care And it was the deficiencies in home-based care – less than adequate follow-up care, lack of awareness amongst patients on the red flags they had to watch out for – which resulted in many patients reaching hospitals late and dying of complications later. The Health Department is now learnt to be drawing up new guidelines for an ‘empowered COVID home care’ initiative, which could close the gaps in home-based care of COVID patients. Treatment protocols are also being revised so that the high-risk categories like pregnant women or those with uncontrolled diabetes, are treated in hospitals and not assigned to home care, once they test positive for COVID. Very early stage The idea is to ensure that these patients are hospitalised as early as possible and may be offered monoclonal antibody therapy. “The therapeutic window of opportunity for treating a patient with monoclonal antibodies is at the very early stage of the disease. These high risk patients should be tested as soon as they exhibit mild symptoms and hospitalised so that they can be started on this treatment,” Dr. Aravind says. In Kerala, the proportion of those who died of COVID without any co-morbidities was just 4%. Uncontrolled diabetes emerged as a major predictor of COVID mortality. With non-COVID care taking a back seat during the pandemic, the treatment continuity of many people with diabetes and such chronic conditions had been affected badly. Public health experts have suggested that the State devote more attention to the management of chronic, progressive non-communicable diseases like diabetes and hypertension so that the vulnerability of this population to severe COVID can be reduced. Protocol revision is thus expected to focus on the vigilance to be maintained while treating pregnant women who are COVID-positive as well as identification of those at additional risk amongst the vulnerable categories.

The calf aged one year and seven months old breathed her last following high fever for the past two days. Veterinarians who oversaw her post-mortem examination suspected infection due to elephant endotheliotropic herpes virus (EEHV) to be the cause of the death. Massive internal bleeding was found during the post-mortem examination. Blood samples were sent to the State Institute of Animal Diseases (SIAD), Palode, for confirming the disease. According to former Chief Veterinary Officer E.K. Easwaran, epidemiology studies would be done to understand the cause of the infection that usually affected elephants aged below 12 years. Antiviral drug, acyclovir, is administered among calves in the age group. He said elephants were tested for the infection every three months. The elephants at the centre had tested negative for the virus during a survey undertaken by the Indian Veterinary Research Institute in Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, two months ago. Birthday fete Sreekutty’s first birthday was celebrated with much fanfare on November 8 last. Since her rescue from the Ambanad estate in Kollam in 2019, where she was found next to her dead mother with injuries on legs, Sreekutty has been carefully nursed back to health.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/elephant-calf-dies-at-kottoor/article35029056.ece

If students’ body temperature is high, they will not be allowed to mingle with other students and instead accommodated separately. Students who test positive for COVID-19 can appear for the examinations at special centres once they turn negative. Students, teachers, and lab assistants have to wear double masks and gloves. Lab equipment should not be reused by other students, and be sanitised before and after use. Laboratories should not be air-conditioned, and their doors and windows should be opened. While Physics, Computer Science, and Computer Applications exams will have a duration of two hours, other subject practicals will be on for one or one-and-a-half hours.

Sampath, 35, a native of Pettah and a driver attached to Uber, was found murdered around 5 a.m. in a rented house adjacent to a shopping mall at Chakka beside the National Highway-66 bypass. The Vanchiyoor police have taken two people, identified as Sanal Muhammed and Sajad of Perumathura, into custody. Both are habitual offenders who have been involved in several criminal and narcotic cases. Alerted by hospital The police were alerted by a private hospital nearby after the duo sought medical attention for hand injuries by 2 a.m. They subsequently confessed to have attacked Sampath in his house. His body was soon found in a pool of blood in the kitchen of his house. Besides slash injuries all over his body, he had been stabbed in his neck and a leg. Blood stains were found in other areas of the house, including the compound wall. The police said there were at least 50 wounds on the body. Forensic experts and the dog squad collected evidence from the house. Drug trade The trio is suspected to have been involved in drug trade. The murder was allegedly spurred by Sanal’s suspicion that Sampath tipped the police off against him during a raid in Attingal three months ago.

Mr. Surendran said Mr. Behera had merely echoed the stance of the BJP. The party had repeatedly warned the public about the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in Kerala. However, the LDF government had chosen to turn a blind eye to such radicals.

Jagan Mohan Reddy has rubbished reports published in a section of media over the management of COVID-19 in the State. During a review meeting on COVID here on Monday, Mr. Jagan said the reports were written in such a way to create panic among the people and stated that legal action would be taken against the two media houses. He said that a publication had highlighted that patients died due to lack of oxygen in Ashram Hospital, Eluru, but in reality medical oxygen was abundant in the State. “We are shocked by the articles which are completely baseless, written with a mischievous mindset. People would have believed it if this was written during peak situations, but now the cases are declining, registering an average positivity rate of less than 5%. In the current scenario, over 70% oxygen beds and ventilators are available . We had 750 tonnes of medical oxygen when COVID was at its peak and now the daily usage has come down to just 180 tonnes. All the oxygen allocations given to the State are being stored at Visakhapatnam Steel Plant and can be used when required,” the Chief Minister said. The Chief Minister criticised a media house for writing an article misquoting him. He said that the post of Chief Minister was being devalued and degraded by such writings. While the government was seriously conducting review meetings, such media houses were making fun as if the officials were attending the review for timepass. He said the State had a good reputation in dealing with COVID, by successfully controlling it. Starting from the village level to State level, it was made possible by the ANM, volunteers, Collectors, district and zonal officers, and medical staff. The officials said that legal action would be taken against the two media houses for defaming the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cm-rubbishes-allegations-over-covid-management/article35029175.ece

29 June 2021||KOLLAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Women must be ready to say no to those demanding dowry’||Governor Arif Mohammed Khan has said that girls should be mentally prepared to say no to proposals demanding dowry. Visiting the family of Vismaya here on Monday, Mr. Khan said he was willing to work as a volunteer to spread awareness against the social evil. "Any daughter of Kerala is my daughter, I feel like crying," said a visibly emotional Governor. "Though Kerala's education, social welfare and health indicators are much better compared to many other States, there are still some social evils and dowry is one," he said. Urging the media to create awareness about the issue, he observed that despite laws being quite strong to take care of such crimes effectively, an organised movement against dowry was needed. "If somebody makes it clear that they want dowry, they should be told in stern terms the proposal can't go ahead. Such demands must not be entertained by the girl's family, and for that, you need awareness," said Mr. Khan. He appealed to the NGOs to launch a special movement against dowry.  Despite laws, an organised movement against dowry is needed, says Arif Khan||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/women-must-be-ready-to-say-no-to-those-demanding-dowry/article35028594.ece
29 June 2021||KURNOOL,ANDHRA PRADESH||Scarcity of sand for construction of houses flagged in meeting||There is a severe scarcity of sand for the construction of houses to be grounded under the Jagananna Pedalandariki Illu scheme and it should be brought in from Kadapa district, Legislative Council Government Whip Gangula Prabhakar Reddy told the District Review Committee meeting held here on Monday. A Review Committee chaired by Minister for Water Resources P. Anil Kumar Yadav discussed ways and means to ensure 100% grounding of houses for the poor under the government’s flagship scheme and directed people’s representatives and officials to take all measures to ensure that grounding of all houses takes place on July 1,3 and 4 in all the constituencies. Mr. Anil Kumar, who is also the district in-charge Minister, said that the Joint Collectors must ensure that sufficient sand (if the source was more than 40 km away) was stocked close to the layout. The meeting also discussed the COVID situation and measures needed for tackling third wave, which is being seen as the next biggest challenge people might face, the Minister said. Finance Minister Buggana Rajendranath said that in Kurnool district more than 40,000 houses would be grounded on July 1, 3 and 4, with a target of grounding 15,360 houses every day. The meeting discussed the development of Jagananna Colonies, MIG Plots development, and infrastructure facilities needed for meeting the demand in the future for facing yet another wave of the pandemic. Layout to be redone in Sirivella mandal In Sirivella mandal of Allagadda Assembly constituency, the layout marked by the officials had got washed away in the floods, which should be redone as early as possible for taking up the construction activity, Mr. Prabhakar Reddy said. He suggested allocating government land close to the towns for the purpose or buying land for the scheme. He also pointed out that the construction of the Rythu Bharosa Kendras, Village Secretariats, and Health Centres was getting delayed due to the scarcity of sand. District Collector G. Veerapandian, Superintendent of Police Fakkeerappa Kaginelli, Kurnool MLA Hafeez Khan, Kurnool MP Sanjeev Kumar, and others attended the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/scarcity-of-sand-for-construction-of-houses-flagged-in-meeting/article35029162.ece
29 June 2021||MANGALURU,ANDHRA PRADESH||KIOCL gets nod for mining in Ballari||The Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has accorded stage I “in-principle approval” for diverting 401.57 hectares of forest land at Devadari Hill Range in Ballari district for iron and manganese ore mining by KIOCL Ltd., a Central undertaking. Chairman and MD of the company M.V. Subba Rao, addressing presspersons in Mangaluru on Monday, said approval was given on June 24. The company is hopeful that the stage II clearance, which is the final one, will be given by the end of this financial year and mining can start in 2022-23. Mr. Rao said the company expects about 33 million tonnes of ore to beavailable for mining over 50 years. It will begin by mining 0.3 million tonnes of ore per annum up to five years. Later, the mining capacity will be increased to two million tonnes a year. The chairman, who is going to retire from service at the end of June, said company would invest about Rs. 1,500 crore to start mining in Swamimalai forest block under Sandur taluk and to set up a beneficiation plant. Once mining picks up on a full scale at Ballari, its 3.5 million tonne per annum pellet plant in Mangaluru can be fully utilised. Its pellet production was at 2.21 million tonnes during 2020-21, as against 2.37 million tonnes the previous financial year. Mr. Rao said the company continues to expand pellet exports to different international markets. At present, exports to China account for 44%, followed by West Asian countries at 41%. The balance goes to Brazil and Malaysia. KIOCL Ltd. had been forced to stop work at its captive mines at Kudremukh hill range on the Western Ghats from January 2006 following a Supreme Court order which banned mining in the eco-sensitive region. Approval for mining in Devadari Hill Range has come as a major relief to the company as it gets access to captive mines. After mining in Kudremukh stopped, the company has been sourcing iron ore mainly from the National Mineral Development Corporation’s mines in Chhattisgarh to operate its pellet plant in Mangaluru.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kiocl-gets-nod-for-mining-in-ballari/article35028595.ece
29 June 2021||MYSURU,ANDHRA PRADESH||A teacher’s tree-top solution to connect with students||A school teacher in Mullur village of Kodagu district has hit upon a treetop solution to digitally connect with his students and ensure continuity of their education during the COVID-19 pandemic. He has fabricated a makeshift room atop a mango tree using locally available materials, including bamboo and grass, besides waste materials. Constructed at a height of 20 feet from the ground, this has helped overcome the problem of weak reception and signal of service providers in this remote village, located about 20 km from Somwarpet, which is the nearest town. C.S. Satheesha is a teacher at the Government Lower Primary School in Mullur. He handles classes for students from grade 1 to 5. But the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent lockdown resulted in the disruption of the children’s education. The impact is more in rural areas, among tribals and first-generation learners as they lack facilities or parental backup, which their urban counterparts have, to ensure continuity in learning. Hence, Mr. Satheesha thought of keeping them engaged during the lockdown with a slew of exercises in English, Kannada, and mathematics, going beyond the syllabus. But connectivity issues forced Mr. Satheesha to do some out-of-the-box thinking. He decided to work from a tree top. It took him two months to build a classroom atop a tree. A conventional RCC roof may have made things easier, but Mr. Satheesha’s house is tiled and sloped — a building practice that is common in the coastal belt where rains are heavy — and hence he thought of this ingenious solution. Atop the tree, the teacher not only feels safe, but also has a double layer of tarpaulin that ensures that the makeshift office, where he imparts online classes, remains waterproof. He invested in a mobile stand and also procured a focus light, which ensures better visibility to children at the other end. “In case of students who do not have a smartphone, I personally distribute exercise sheets during my rounds in the village as part of my COVID-19 duty with an instruction that the answer sheets would be collected by evening,” said Mr. Satheesha. The online classes also focus on the immediate surroundings of the children. They are asked to identify a bulb, a mirror, a furniture or anything around them and describe their function in full sentences in English. Not only has this endeavour ensured continuity in learning, but children are learning how to make short videos and upload them for evaluation. The day starts with a ‘WhatsApp Challenge’ comprising a set of questions tailor-made for each student and sent out by the teacher. By evening, the challenge is accepted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/a-teachers-tree-top-solution-to-connect-with-students/article35028600.ece

29 June 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||CBI seeks to record Narayanan’s statement||A Central Bureau of Investigation team was here to investigate the police “frame-up” that allegedly resulted in the infamous “ISRO spy case” in 1994. Last month, the CBI filed an FIR marked as classified in the Chief Judicial Magistrate court here accusing four former law enforcers of “wrongful arrest, custodial torture, and unjustified incarceration” of former ISRO scientist Nambi Narayanan and others. It had named retired Director General of Police Siby Mathews, who headed the Special Investigation Team (SIT) that probed the ISRO scandal, his deputies K.K. Joshua, S. Vijayan, and Thampi. S. Durgadutt, and the then Deputy Director, Intelligence Bureau, R.B. Sreekumar, as accused in the FIR. Recently, a district court here had granted anticipatory bail to Mr. Mathews in the case. According to sources close to Mr. Narayanan, the CBI had contacted the former scientist and sought time to take his statement on Tuesday. They said the agency had spoken to him on the phone. Mr. Narayanan reportedly told the investigators that he was ready to give his statement. However, the agency had not fixed the interview venue. It was not immediately known whether the CBI had contacted the accused in the case. They have also moved the court for anticipatory bail. The grim chapter in the annals of police investigation in Kerala has its provenance in a case registered at the Vanchiyoor station on November 13, 1994. Based on a “dubious” special branch report, the police had booked two Maldivian women for overstay and violation of the provisions of the Official Secrets Act. The charging officers accused the women of attempting to entrap ISRO scientists involved in the cryogenic engine procurement project. In addition, they alleged the women had spirited out high-end space secrets out of India for a foreign power. Soon, newspapers were awash with “ill-informed and salacious” reports about honey traps, stolen rocket designs, ensnared scientists, complicit politicians, and conniving police officers. Mr. Narayanan, fellow scientist D. Sasikumaran, and two ISRO consultants K. Chandrasekhar and Sudhir Kumar Sharma were caught up in the vortex of the stormy scandal. Opposing factions in the then ruling Congress exploited the scandal to settle scores. The ISRO spy case led to the resignation of then Chief Minister K. Karunakaran. The CBI had registered the case at the behest of the Supreme Court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cbi-seeks-to-record-narayanans-statement/article35028598.ece

Addressing a press conference on Monday, the association’s State convener Jayadheer Babu said that the employees were agitated by the G.O. 64 issued by the government. “The decisions were hitherto being discharged by department offiicals who have a fair knowledge and experience of the medical and health sector. In the past too, the government was requested not to appoint any officials who have no knowledge of medical and health administration. It is a challenge for employees and officials to apprise civil servants on medical and health terminology,” Dr. Babu said, adding that the association demands the immediate withdrawal of the G.O. Dr. Babu said that a Joint Action Committee (JAC) of employee associations has been formed to launch a stir against the G.O. The Joint Action Committee would meet Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and Chief Secretary Adityanath Das to urge the government to do the needful. “If the G.O. is not withdrawn immediately, the doctors will boycott Doctors Day on July 1 and will not accept any awards, rewards or incentives given on the occasion,” he said. A.P. Government Employees Association president K.R. Suryanarayana, and APNGOs Association president Chandrasekhar Reddy also opposed the G.O.

29 June 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||YSRCP govt. failed on all fronts: Veerraju||BJP State president Somu Veerraju has alleged that the Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy government has failed on all fronts and the plight of people has worsened as the Chief Minister is implementing his decisions without taking anyone into confidence. “People have been disillusioned with the two-year tenure of the YSRCP. The government has become a synonymous to corruption and Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s words have been confined to rhetoric,” he said in the State party executive meeting here on Monday. Mr. Veerraju said the government was increasing taxes to make up for its inability to mop up resources in a way that’s not pinching the pockets of the common man. He accused the government of pandering to some castes and religions with an eye on vote banks. He demanded that the government release a white paper on the sale of liquor and the income accruing from it to the exchequer, and alleged that liquor was freely available at illegal outlets. He objected to naming of houses being built with funding by the Central government as Jagananna Colonies. Water sharing Irrigation projects in Rayalaseema region were completely neglected and the government has failed in stopping Telangana from drawing Krishna river water through projects being illegally constructed by it, he said. Besides, there was a likelihood of the State losing its share of the Godavari, Krishna and Tungabhadra river waters in the process of their interlinking. On the other hand, the farmers were deprived of remunerative prices as the government turned a blind eye to their woes. Lakhs of jobs were lost due to the government’s negligence in the establishment of the petrochemical complex, Mr. Veerraju said, calling for a collective fight against the government’s anti-people policies. Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan said the YSRCP government was unable to control the coronavirus in spite of advance warnings by the Centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-govt-failed-on-all-fronts-veerraju/article35029182.ece

The steep hike in petroleum, diesel, LPG and edible oil prices compounded their woes as it stoked inflation. But, the Centre pursued its agenda without an iota of concern for the plight of the masses, he alleged. Addressing the media on the sidelines of the birth centenary celebrations of former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao at the State party office here on Monday, Mr. Chandy said it was time the opposition parties fought against the Centre’s anti-people policies. He said the economy was going through an ‘unprecedented crisis’ due to rolling out a red-carpet to some profit-seeking private enterprises. Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee president S. Sailajanath said the three controversial farm Bills passed by Parliament were detrimental to farmers, and that the minorities were having a tough time warding off forces inimical to them. He pointed out that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was bent on privatising Visakhapatnam Steel Plant as part of his economic agenda unmindful of the consequences for thousands of employees and Andhra Pradesh. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy neither had the courage nor the interest to get the promises made at the time of bifurcation, especially Special Category Status, fulfilled, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/people-suffering-under-nda-rule-oommen-chandy/article35029183.ece

The Transport Department has finally received the chip-enabled cards from the supplier and is despatching them. It may be recalled that FDL applicants, who had cleared the driving test, and those who applied for renewal, are awaiting the receipt of their smart cards for nearly a year. The applicants initially made rounds to the offices of the Transport Department only to be told that they would have to wait longer as a new contractor was yet to be appointed by the government for supply of the smart cards. On an average, around 600 DL cards a day are issued by the Transport Department in Visakhapatnam district, with a major chunk of the applicants coming from the city. The Regional Transport Authority (RTA), Visakhapatnam, issues around 300 new and renewal cards on an average every day. This apart, the Transport Offices at Gajuwaka and Anakapalle together issue around 300 cards a day. Hundreds of FDL applicants as also those who applied for renewal of their old DL cards have been agitated over the delay. Motorists all over the State are facing the same problem. They can breathe easy now. They may, however, have to wait for some more time to receive their smarts cards in view of the huge waiting list. In the meantime, they can continue to carry a PDF of their DL and show it to the traffic police on duty “The receipt of cards by the applicants may take some more months as there are over one lakh cards to be printed in the district,” says Deputy Transport Commissioner G.C. Rajaratnam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/transport-dept-starts-despatching-of-smart-driving-licence-cards/article35029191.ece

29 June 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||GVMC proposal on new property tax untenable, says former bureaucrat||The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation’s proposal to shift the property tax regime from annual rental value (ARV) to capital value (CV), is untenable and against the letter and spirit of democracy, said former Union secretary E.A.S. Sarma. In a letter to the Chief Secretary on Monday, he pointed out that the civic body passing the resolution on January 31, 2021, when there was no elected civic body and at a time when it was known to the government that the elections would be held shortly, as per court orders, was undemocratic. Mr. Sarma pointed out that in a way it subverted the elected body from examining the proposal from the people's point of view and expressing its views fearlessly and independently. Even though an elected body came into existence in the GVMC on June 3, instead of taking back the matter to the elected body as required under Rule 6, the GVMC Commissioner chose to issue the draft notification directly, calling for objections from the public. This once again made a mockery of the idea of local self-governance, he said. The former bureaucrat pointed out that bringing the new tax regime at a time when the two waves of COVID-19 pandemic have literally sapped the citizens of their incomes and crippled their economies, was inhuman. At such a time, for the State government to rush through such a regressive change in the taxation system shows how insensitive it is to the feelings and needs of people, he said. Many States have announced COVID relief on property tax, in contrast with what the Andhra Pradesh government is doing. Among them are next-door Telangana, Maharashtra and Gujarat, he said. According to him, property tax is leviable annually and, keeping in view the nature of it, the only rational and fair basis for determining the rate of property tax is to link it to the annual returns that a given property will potentially yield, not its imaginary value that the landowner may derive in the rare event of selling the property at a future date. “In many fast expanding cities, in low-income colonies, real estate development would have taken pace, spiking the land values notionally, which in itself may not increase the incomes of the low-income families still residing there. Also, even if the Basic Value of land in a given Ward/Block is high, the incomes of some households residing there may not be high, in which case, a low-income household, in the new CV tax regime will be taxed, not on the basis of what the potential annual return on the property is but on the basis of a high notional sale value, which would be wrong to do,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/gvmc-proposal-on-new-property-tax-untenable-says-former-bureaucrat/article35029195.ece

Venkaiah Naidu on Monday paid rich tributes to former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao on the latter’s birth centenary and described him as a ‘legendary figure who had pioneered economic reforms’, in Visakhapatnam on Monday. “Narasimha Rao was a multi-faceted personality—a phenomenal scholar, an astute administrator, a littérateur of renown and multi-linguist. He had steered the country away from an economic crisis through his consensual leadership and far-sighted vision,” said the Vice-President who garlanded a statue of Narasimha Rao at the Circuit House Junction in Visakhapatnam. He said the bold reforms initiated by Narasimha Rao had helped accelerate the country’s development over the past three decades. Crediting Narasimha Rao for ending the ‘Licence Raj’ in India, Mr. Naidu said Rao was the architect of India’s economic liberalisation. “It was him who had facilitated India’s entry into the World Trade Organisation (WTO),” Mr. Naidu pointed out. Love for language Recalling that the former Prime Minister had great love for languages, Mr. Naidu said Narasimha Rao had translated epic Telugu novel ‘Veyi Padagalu’ into Hindi titled as ‘Sahasra Phan’ and also published ‘Abala Jeevitam’, a Telugu translation of the famous Marathi novel “Pan Lakshat Kon Gheto”. “Narasimha Rao had always vouched for education in mothertongues in schools. I too have always maintained that the medium of instruction should be the child’s mothertongue up to high school level. The today’s generation should take inspiration from him ,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/narasimha-rao-steered-india-away-from-economic-crisis-venkaiah/article35029185.ece
29 June 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Tribal teacher’s death due to illness sparks off controversy||The death of a tribal teacher of the Sileru Tribal Welfare Ashram School for Girls due to ill-health sparked off a controversy, here on Monday. K. Viswanadham, a secondary grade teacher, died while undergoing treatment for some unknown sickness at a hospital in the city recently. He had not been paid his salary for the past several months reportedly due to some technical issues. Girijana Sangham leader P. Appalanarasa said that the school was started in September, 2018, by converting a boys’ hostel. Though 11 posts were sanctioned, there were only three regular employees including Viswanadham, who was appointed on the basis of the 2018 DSC. They were not given CFMS ID, a must for regular employees, despite several representations, he said. Viswanadham had requested the officials concerned several times to sanction his salary so that he could take better treatment for the illness he had been suffering from for a long time. The officials neglected the genuine demand of the teacher, Mr. Appalanarasa alleged. When contacted, the school headmaster Ch. Krishna said that Viswanadham and another teacher K. Dhananjay were not given their CFMS ID and not paid salaries for the past eight months. Viswanadham was a native of Gadugupalli village of Hukumpeta mandal in the Agency area of the district. ‘Pay ex gratia’ Meanwhile, TDP national General Secretary Nara Lokesh held the ‘negligence of the officials’ and ‘inefficient rule’ of the YSR Congress Party government responsible for the death of the teacher. He tweeted that the teacher was not paid salary for nine months and had no money for the treatment of his illness, which reflected the ‘sorry state of affairs’ in the State. Mr. Lokesh also tweeted that apart from payment of salary arrears, Rs. 50 lakh should be paid as ex gratia and a member of the family should be given a job.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tribal-teachers-death-due-to-illness-sparks-off-controversy/article35029189.ece

The victims were identified as Bheemaraya (45), Shantamma (36), Sridevi (13) Sumitra (12), Shivaraj (9) and Lakshmi (4). The real cause of the incident is, however, yet to be ascertained. But, quoting villagers as saying, Superintendent of Police C.B. Vedamurthy said that all six drowned themselves in a Krishi Honda formed on a farm land belonging to the mother of Bheemaraya. The Superintendent of Police further said that local sources told him that Bheemaraya had no land of his own and had formed the Krishi Honda on his mother’s land. He had also availed himself of more than Rs. 20 lakh loan from private persons to develop the land for horticulture crop but failed to get the expected results. Unable to bear the financial difficulties, he and his wife might have decided to end their life, along with their children, Mr. Vedamurthy said. Mr. Vedamurthy also said that the incident might have happened early in the morning. Local swimmers and personnel from Fire and Emergency Services retrieved all the six bodies and the police have sent them for autopsy. MLA Venkatareddy Mudnal and Deputy Commissioner R.

29 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Bank on herd immunity only after 60% vaccination’||President of the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) K. Srinath Reddy has advocated for strengthening the healthcare system from the primary level to effectively face the third wave of coronavirus infection, as and when it happens, and cautioned against any complacency in following COVID norms. Speaking after virtually receiving the P.V. Narasimha Rao Lifetime Achievement Award on the occasion of the conclusion of birth centenary celebration of the former Prime Minister on Monday, the public health expert said the third wave of COVID-19 pandemic was only a speculation now but when it becomes a certainty, it would be only due to complacency. Stating that the herd immunity was an attribute of the population and not an individual, Dr. Srinath Reddy, who was associated with P.V. Narasimha Rao as his personal physician during his tenure as the Prime Minister, said people who were neither vaccinated nor have developed herd immunity would be vulnerable to the infection when they go out of the “safe environment” they were in now. He cautioned against super spreader events either allowed as part of “unlock” or organised as celebrations and congregations by organisations or individuals as “virus too will celebrate such occasions to spread itself further”. He also suggested people to be cautious while travelling as it too could allow spread of virus. “It’s not the infrastructure such as ventilator and oxygen beds that would help face the third wave, but strengthening of the healthcare system and following the COVID norms scrupulously would do,” Dr. Reddy said adding that all such efforts should be unified, countrywide. He observed that the impression that the first wave of the COVID pandemic was well controlled with a long lockdown and unwinding it in phases was erroneous. The devastation of the second wave was enormous as it caught everyone on the wrong foot. The distinguished cardiologist, who headed the Cardiology Department at AIIMS, New Delhi, before he quit public service, said herd immunity would be effective with at least 60% threshold vaccination. The viral transmission would come down with such large-scale vaccination as had happened in Brazil, where deaths have come down by 90% and infections by 86% after vaccination. Dr. Srinath Reddy suggested speeding up of vaccination, ecological sensibility and following COVID protocols would only help confront the virus confidently.  Those who are neither vaccinated nor have developed herd immunity would be vulnerable to infection when they go out of the safe environment they are in now. K.

29 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||He was a statesman and a scholar: Manmohan Singh||Former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao’s vision for the economic liberalisation has its transforming impact not just on the Indian economy but on the global scenario too in a certain measure, another former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said at the birth centenary celebrations of the former organised by Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) here on Monday. Mr. Singh, who held the Finance portfolio in the Narasimha Rao Cabinet, who participated in the event virtually from New Delhi said: “PV was truly a ‘sanyasi’ (saint) in the spectrum of politics. He was not only a statesman but a scholar too”. He stated that the economic and foreign policy of the country was given a long-lasting shape during PV’s tenure. His (PV’s) statesmanship had improved relations with neighbouring countries on one hand and on the other several strategic defence initiatives were taken up during the Narasimha Rao regime, including the launch of ballistic missile technology programme. Testing of ASLV and PSLV technologies, firming up nuclear technology for self-defence of the country were some of the achievements of the PV’s administration, Mr. Singh said. On Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India, who has been selected for the first PV Lifetime Achievement Award, Mr. Manmohan Singh said the former had made an immense contribution towards strengthening the public health system in the country by establishing five institutes of public health. Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, who too participated in the event virtually, recollected how PV had restored the country’s honour by getting back the gold mortgaged by the previous government. He also played a key role in shaping the 73rd and 74th amendments to the Constitution to strengthen the local bodies and the uni-gauge programme had converted 25,000 km of metre gauge and 5,000 km of narrow gauge rail lines into broad gauge. Stating that P.V. Narasimha Rao had the courage and conviction to face the challenges and resolve them, Mr. Kharge said when India had lost a strong ally with the disintegration of USSR he (PV) countered the threats from Pakistan and China with alacrity. “Narasimha Rao had sent A.B. Vajpayee to address the UN on human rights not for the latter’s oratory skills but to show that India was united against external as well as internal threats,” Mr. Kharge recounted. Outgoing president of TPCC N. Uttam Kumar Reddy termed PV as “one of the great sons of India and the greatest son of Telangana”. He stated that PV would be remembered for the landmark reforms in the State and at the national level. “As the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, he had brought-in path-breaking land reforms enabling land distribution to tribals and dalits through the Land Ceiling Act. As the PM he had changed the financial landscape/structure of India along with Mr. Manmohan Singh making India a global economic power. Later, the PV Liftetime Achievement Award was presented virtually to Dr. Srinath Reddy, who too ‘received’ in virtually from Mr. Manmohan Singh. Incoming president of TPCC A.

29 June 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Struck by tragedy, but no time to grieve||Bhavani got married to Thadaka Hari Babu on November 22, 2007 in her hometown, Parigi, near Vikarabad. They couldn’t be happier as they moved to Hyderabad soon after in search of work. Over time, the couple bought a Toyota Etios Liva on EMI which Hari Babu deployed for a ride-hailing app. Nearly 12 years after marriage, after a pilgrimage to Tirupati, they were blessed with a child, Girija. Things appeared to go swimmingly well for the family — until April 22 this year. That day, Hari Babu began sweating profusely and had a mild cough. The family panicked and he went for a COVID test. The pandemic scenario was beginning to change in Telangana in the final week of April. On April 22, Telangana reported 6,206 positive cases with 29 deaths. The caseload was surging and labs conducting the tests took between 24 and 36 hours to share the results. Three days after the test, Hari Babu learnt that he had tested positive for COVID-19, the couple went to a clinic near Nagole and returned home with medicines prescribed by the doctor. Turn for worse “He was feeling better, the cough had subsided. But on April 28, after breakfast, he started sweating and had a little cough. My mother-in-law started crying. My panicked brothers arranged a bed at Gandhi Hospital. My husband became breathless by the time we reached the hospital. At 3.45 p.m. as he was being wheeled in for admission, he died,” says Bhavani. “My world collapsed at that moment,” says Bhavani, cradling her two-year-old daughter. “We paid EMI of Rs. 13,700 without a break for the past three years. Now 32 EMIs are pending and one cheque has already bounced. The bank charged Rs. 2,000 for that default,” says Bhavani, who has pledged her 5.5 tolas of gold jewellery to repay the EMIs and manage the household. “The South India Bank where we had a joint account asked me to start another account by depositing Rs. 2,500 to transfer the gold loan money,” says Bhavani, who now keeps scrolling through the couple’s photographs. Her mother’s loan of Rs. 2 lakh was what served as seed money to buy the car that Hari Babu drove. “We live in a rented house. The rent is Rs. 6,000. If I can repay the car loan, I will sell it and start a kirana store,” says Bhavani, who has been a homemaker all her life. “I cannot go back to my native place Parigi as it has too many memories of my husband. I have to live here for my daughter,” she adds.  We paid EMI of Rs. 13,700 without a break for the past three years. Now 32 EMIs are pending and one cheque has already bounced.

29 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Schools, colleges to have only online classes from July 1||The State government on Monday issued an order confining reopening of schools and colleges from July 1 to online classes only. The opening of schools, junior, degree and technical colleges and all other educational institutions from July 1 will be permitted in online mode on various digital, TV and T-SAT platforms. The attendance of teaching staff will be limited to 50 per cent of the total strength. The government obviously took the decision keeping in view the constraints in physical attendance of students for classroom lectures due to COVID. The capacity of classrooms to hold 50 per cent of the strength, safety in social welfare hostels, packed autorickshaws to shift them to schools and back home and the mandatory 220 days of calender year if the classes were to be held on alternate days were factors that weighed in giving up physical appearance, sources said. By another order, the government directed all recognised private schools affiliated to State, Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE), Indian Certificate for Secondary Education and other international boards not to increase any kind of fees for students in 2021-22. They will charge only tuition fee on monthly basis till further orders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/schools-colleges-to-have-only-online-classes-from-july-1/article35028955.ece
29 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||GHMC Council meeting to be held on virtual platform||The first ever meeting of the GHMC Council after election of Mayor and Deputy Mayor, will be held without much ado on virtual platform on Tuesday, amid protests by opposition. This decision has been taken despite the absence of any provision in the GHMC Act for conducting the meeting online. GHMC has released a statement on Monday that the special budget and general body meeting will begin online at 10.30 a.m. COVID-19 pandemic situation has been cited as the reason for the decision to go online. Meeting ids have been sent to all the members, the note said. Media has been excluded from covering the meeting. Mayor Gadwal Vijayalakshmi will make the inaugural speech at the meeting after which the budget for the year 2021-22 will be presented. Mayor will administer oath to the newly elected corporator from Lingojiguda D.Rajashekhar Reddy, before the general body meeting takes up various public issues. This is the first time in GHMC’s history that the council meeting will be conducted online. Though COVID-19 was prevalent during the election of Mayor and Deputy Mayor, the meeting then was conducted with physical presence of members. The Telangana Legislative Assembly meetings too were conducted physically during mid-March. Infection spread was however on the wane between January and March when the meetings were conducted. Though GHMC Council meeting was to be conducted once in three months, officials refrained from calling for it during the first wave of the pandemic. Virtual meeting was mulled over, but it did not take off, as there was no provision in GHMC Act for it, officials shared. Meanwhile, several corporators from BJP addressed a letter to GHMC Commissioner D.S. Lokesh Kumar opposing the decision to conduct the council meeting online. They cited government’s statistics to say that the number of COVID-19 cases have come down due to which the lockdown has been lifted. In view of these two factors and the Chief Minister attending large public meetings, the council meeting with attendance of not more than 250 members may be conducted with physical presence, they pointed out. If needed, the venue may be changed to any spacious premises outside GHMC, they suggested. Minister K.T. Rama Rao too is attending meetings and launch events, Uppal Corporator M. Rajitha Parameshwar Reddy pointed out, and alleged that the government is scared of people’s issues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ghmc-council-meeting-to-be-held-on-virtual-platform/article35028960.ece
29 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Sorry state of Nampally Area Hospital stuns Union Minister||Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy had to do some fire fighting when he visited the Nampally Area Hospital on Monday morning. While he was there ostensibly to check on the ongoing COVID-19 vaccination drive, he noticed a huge crowd at the hospital. On probing further and going around the wards, the hospital medical and health personnel poured out their tales of woe. Apparently, the 350 KV transformer burst a long time ago due to excess load and the replacement is not sufficient. Result is that the X-ray machine at the hospital which requires three-phase power is not working, forcing scores of patients to go out for such tests. The 100-bed hospital has been plagued with low voltage fluctuations causing many computer systems and others to go bust and the roof is leaky all through even in the paediatric ward, whenever there is a downpour. A proposal to build a separate out-patient block has been pending for years. Mr. Kishan Reddy called up the engineering wing official concerned and the TS power distribution firm general manager even as he was being shown around, to urge them to provide the right capacity transformer without further delay, ensure there are no voltage fluctuations and take up immediate repairs for the building, especially the faulty wiring. “We will look into the money aspect later but first please install the transformer. This is a public hospital catering to a large section of the poor, especially from the minority community. There are pregnant women coming here for tests,” he pointed out. The Minister made an effort to talk to the district collector but she was not available. He requested the hospital in-charge to present him a list of immediate works to be taken up and promised to return to check on them soon. Earlier, Mr. Reddy accompanied by senior BJP leader and national OBC Morcha president K. Laxman also visited the vaccination centres at Kavadiguda and Domalguda, where he stated that the Centre had made a plan to make available 300 crore vaccine doses so that at least one dose is given to the entire population by the year-end. “It takes 128-140 days for the indigenous vaccine to come out of the manufacturing unit and there are raw materials issues, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi is personally monitoring the biggest vaccination exercise in the world. The Centre was forced to take over the project as the States had failed in this aspect,” he claimed. Mr. Laxman said the vaccination pace has been laggard in Telangana compared to neighbouring Andhra Pradesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sorry-state-of-nampally-area-hospital-stuns-union-minister/article35028944.ece

Of this, Rs. 59,440.44 crore has been earmarked for crop production, maintenance and marketing and another Rs. 16,537.28 crore for investment credit and allied activities. Agricultural term loans for infrastructure are pegged at Rs. 3,895.61 crore and those for ancillary sector at Rs. 11,668.38 crore, taking the total agriculture credit to Rs. 91,541.71 crore spread over 63.67 lakh accounts and constituting 49.2% of the total credit plan. Credit for the MSME sector is estimated at Rs. 39,361.16 crore amounting to 21.16% of the credit plan. Medium scale enterprises are set to get credit of Rs. 15,275.44 crore and small scale enterprises Rs. 12,046.76 crore while lending to 5.01 lakh accounts pertaining to micro enterprises will be Rs. 12,038.66 crore.

The 29th meeting of the State Level Bankers Committee which released the annual credit plan in the presence of Finance Minister T. Harish Rao projected the requirement of non-priority sector at Rs. 41,681.54 crore constituting 22.41% of the total credit plan. Mr. Harish Rao exhorted the bankers to ensure timely disbursal of farm credit to farmers. The Minister outlined the innovative measures launched by the State government for farmers’ welfare and said Rs. 7,360 crore was recently credited into the accounts of over 61 lakh farmers within a week. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had issued instructions that the amounts under the Rythu Bandhu scheme should not be diverted and banks should take steps to ensure that the amounts were credited into savings accounts of farmers. Stressing the need for timely release of farm loans, the Minister said it would go a long way in meeting the requirements like purchase of essentials like seed, fertilizer and other inputs. Appreciating the role of banks during the COVID-19 pandemic, he wanted them to provide more Mudra loans to small businesses. The government is encouraging cultivation of oil palm and other varieties of crops and steps had been initiated to speed up setting up of special food processing zones. SLBC president Om Prakash Mishra, RBI regional director Nikhila and Nabard chief general manager Y. Krishna Rao were among those who represented the banking sector. Principal Finance secretary K. Ramakrishna Rao, Panchayat Raj principal secretary Sandeep Kumar Sultania, Finance Department special secretary Ronald Ross and other senior officials attended the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/states-annual-credit-plan-fixed-at-rs-186-lakh-crore/article35028974.ece
29 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Event reduced to TRS party function: BJP||The BJP criticised Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao for making the 100th birth anniversary function of former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao a “party function” and for trying to score political brownie points. “Does KCR really have any affection for PV or is it a drama?,” wondered National OBC president and senior leader K. Laxman on Monday. “The Chief Minister should have called all the Opposition leaders for the function and done the event in a more honourable fashion like a government one but not even the area corporator was invited in utter disregard to the protocol,” he charged. Mr. Laxman accused the government of playing to the gallery by grandly announcing Rs. 10 crore for the anniversary celebrations but spending Rs. 2 crore only after paying respects at the PV Ghat accompanied Union Minister of State G. Kishan Reddy, G. Narayana Reddy, B. Chandra Reddy and others. “Eminent personalities like PV should be treated with more respect. The Centre has been giving due importance to the former PM and a postal stamp has been released due to the initiative taken by Mr. Kishan Reddy,” he said. The Congress party and the Gandhi family continued to ignore PV’s services to the nation during a grave period when the financial position was in doldrums and the country was facing danger from every corner. Mr. Kishan Reddy recalled the PV’s services as a Minister in the united AP, as a Chief Minister, Central Minister and later as the Prime Minister. His land, administrative and social reforms during his various stints set the right tone for the country, he observed. Senior leader N. Ramchander Rao, State party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar and P.V’s grandson N.V. Subash also paid their tributes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/event-reduced-to-trs-party-function-bjp/article35028971.ece

Recently, Anand underwent a leg surgery and he had a doctor's appointment at Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences on Monday. According to Kothakota circle inspector Y Mallikarjun Reddy, the accident took place between 2.30 a.m. and 3 a.m. and there were no eye-witnesses to the ghastly road accident. “We suspect the driver could have lost control and rammed a moving lorry from behind as he dosed off on the wheel or the lorry driver could have applied sudden brakes to avoid hitting a stray dog or other animal crossing the highway,” he said. The lorry was carrying empty liquor bottles from Tamil Nadu to Hyderabad. The lorry driver fled from the spot and there were no CCTV cameras in the area.

29 June 2021||SANGAREDDY,TELANGANA||Life a daily struggle for this teenager||Some are born with a silver spoon in their mouth while for others, life is a daily struggle. The coronavirus pandemic has turned life upside down for Mettu Navaneetha, dashing her dreams and hopes to the ground. Her father Sailoo, a rickshaw puller, passed away three years ago, leaving her mother Lakshmi, a labourer, to shoulder the responsibility of the family. Staying in a modest single-room house, Lakshmi developed COVID-like symptoms of fever and running nose on May 25. Due to financial crunch, Navaneetha could not admit her mother in a hospital. Finally, with the suggestion as well as financial assistance of a few relatives, the teenager decided to take her mother to a government hospital. But as luck would have it, Lakshmi died on the way, lying on the seat of an autorickshaw. Navaneetha brought the body back home in the same auto, but was shocked to realise that none of her neighbours even cared to look out of their window, let alone helping her with the funeral. “The body was wrapped in cloth and sent to the graveyard. Everyone left Navaneetha to her fate. Being a relative, I am taking care of her,” Gouri, a relative, says. Navaneetha is pursuing second year intermediate at a government college. “My mother used to work at a high school. The authorities were kind enough to employ me in her place,” she says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/life-a-daily-struggle-for-this-teenager/article35028932.ece

29 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||City gyms ready to scale up operations after easing of norms||With further easing of the lockdown guidelines, gymnasiums in the city resumed operations on Monday. Apart from the usual sanitisation and temperature checks of members, several gym owners said that vaccination has been made mandatory while some others added that those vaccinated will get incentives in terms of membership deals. Chirag Sethi, vice-president of the Delhi Gym Association said: “The SOPs were already drafted. This time we have also advised members of the association to promote vaccinations and give discounts. We are not making it mandatory but are trying to incentivise. The staff members are also vaccinated. There are about 5,500 gyms in the city and around 1 lakh people are employed directly or indirectly. The lockdowns have increased burdens on owners as well and many also had to shut down.” Novel training Siddharth Singh of Crosstrain Fight Club, however, said that vaccination of members have been made mandatory. Mr. Singh also added that with only five months of operations in the last 14 months, novel training methods were being devised to improve the business. “We are into combat sports and it is usually difficult to maintain social distancing while training. So we have created a special programme where members will get 30 minutes of personalised workout. It will be circuit training and there is no fixed time. Members can visit whenever they choose to. Usually we used to train 50 people in a group which is not ideal right now,” said Mr. Singh while adding that this was in addition to the regular protocol that are followed. Improved revenue Stating that despite the unprecedented situation, it was important to re-innovate and hope for improved revenue, Mr. Singh said: “The last year has definitely affected revenue but we are keen to solve the issues. We have to evolve and survive so that once there is a boom, we have benefits to reap. We are confident that our new programme will be effective.” Some also said that along with reopening of centres, online classes will continue. Rupali Kapoor of BoxFit said: “We will be opening our centre next week. Currently, we are having a thorough sanitisation process. We have a studio where only personal training will be practised. One has to book a particular slot and sanitise prior to and after training. The multiple lockdowns did affect us a lot. But initially, people did not know about online training but now it is better. So we will continue with our online training as well.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/city-gyms-ready-to-scale-up-operations-after-easing-of-norms/article35028858.ece

Hearing dates The order, released by Registrar General Manoj Jain, also said that all the pending routine or non-urgent matters listed in the High Court between July 3 and July 23 shall be adjourned en bloc to corresponding dates between August 21 and September 9. A similar order was passed by the High Court with regard to the functioning of district courts here, stating that all the judicial officers shall take up urgent matters and ‘final arguments cases’ of their respective courts through videoconferencing till July 23 while the order matters shall be adjourned. Utmost precaution The administrative order said that despite decline in the number of COVID-19 cases in the national capital, utmost precaution needs to be taken in view of the predicted third wave and limited availability of vaccines. The order also advised the stakeholders to get themselves vaccinated at the earliest. After the imposition of the first nationwide lockdown, the High Court started conducting hearings through videoconferencing from March 24 last year to contain the spread of the pandemic. Over five months later, the High Court resumed physical hearing of court proceedings initially with five of its Benches on a rotation basis from September 1. The number of Benches conducting physical hearing was increased gradually. The HC later commenced complete physical functioning from March 15 this year, which was interrupted due to the second wave of the COVID-19. In April, taking a serious view of the “alarming rise in COVID-19 cases” in the Capital, the High Court decided to take up court proceedings through virtual mode only from April 9.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-to-stick-to-virtual-hearing-till-july-23-over-delta-plus-threat/article35028845.ece

Our struggle is to save the public healthcare system,” Mr. Shergil told The Hindu . “We are protesting against the State’s 6th pay commission recommendations over delinking of Non-Practicing Allowance from the basic pay.

Ms. Mayawati emphasised that her party’s focus was on the Assembly polls and not on the ongoing zilla panchayat chairperson elections. She defended her decision to not field candidates for the zilla panchayat chairperson posts, saying that winning the seats depended on “sale and purchase” and “misuse” of the state machinery. The BJP government was adopting the ways of the previous SP (Samajwadi Party) government and the polls were not independent, she alleged. ‘Strengthen party’ Ms. Mayawati told her party workers that instead of spending time and energy in these polls, they should invest on strengthening the organisation of the BSP and increase its support base among ‘ sarvasamaj ’ or all communities.

29 June 2021||Mumbai,||Pandemic spurs revamp of iconic hospital||The COVID-19 pandemic has revved up the refurbishment of one of the oldest and most iconic hospitals in south Mumbai. Masina Hospital in Byculla will soon have renovated wards and operation theatres with state-of-the-art equipment. “It will be more of upgradation than complete change. We are not going to increase the present capacity, nor will there be changes in the heritage structure of the hospital. We compete with some of the best hospitals not only in the city but in the country,” Behram Khodaiji, joint CEO of the hospital, said. In a bid to do so, the hospital management is aiming at refurbishment. “It will be renovation of wards, making state-of-the-art operation theatres. The work has begun and it is going to be over in an year,” he said. Masina Hospital was established by Dr. Hormasji Masina in 1902 and has a campus of around seven and a half acres. The heritage building that stands today was donated by Sir David Sassoon and the entire property was then acquired at Rs. 25,000. A trust of prominent Parsi citizens was established to run the hospital and it continues to manage the hospital even today. While renovation plans were always on the cards, the pandemic led the management to give it an impetus. “We thought now is the time to ramp up and provide congenial atmosphere not only to patients but doctors as well. Patients will follow with good doctors and a proper eco-system to make everyone feel good and confident in a modern setting,” Mr. Khodaiji said. The hospital which began with only five to six beds, now has 270 beds. “It is a full fledged multi-speciality tertiary care hospital. We are very proud of this rich legacy and want to take it forward,” Mr. Khodaiji said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/pandemic-spurs-revamp-of-iconic-hospital/article35029054.ece

29 June 2021||Washington,||U.S. air strikes hit Iran-backed militias in Syria, Iraq: Pentagon||The U.S. has, on President Joe Biden’s direction, conducted air strikes at two locations in Syria and one in Iraq, the Pentagon announced. The early morning “defensive precision air strikes” were carried out on facilities along the Iraq-Syria border used by Iran-backed militias to conduct drone attacks against American personnel and facilities in Iraq, according to the Pentagon. U.K-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said seven militia members were killed in the air strikes. “Several Iran-backed militia groups, including Kata’ib Hezbollah (KH) and Kata’ib Sayyid al-Shuhada (KSS), used these facilities,” a statement from Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said. Mr. Biden had directed further action to deter the attacks alleged by the U.S., Mr. Kirby said. The Biden administration already conducted air strikes against facilities used by Iran-backed groups on the Syrian side of the Iraq-Syria border. “Given the ongoing series of attacks by Iran-backed groups targeting U.S. interests in Iraq, the President directed further military action to disrupt and deter such attacks. We are in Iraq at the invitation of the Government of Iraq for the sole purpose of assisting the Iraqi Security Forces in their efforts to defeat ISIS. The United States took necessary, appropriate, and deliberate action designed to limit the risk of escalation — but also to send a clear and unambiguous deterrent message,” Mr. Kirby said. ‘In self-defence’ “As a matter of international law, the U.S. acted pursuant to its right of self-defence. The strikes were both necessary to address the threat and appropriately limited in scope,” he said. While the Syrian Observatory said seven militia members were killed, the BBC reported that Sana, Syrian state media, saying three civilians and a child were killed in the strikes. The strikes come at a significant time in Iran and in Iran-U.S. relations. Last week, Iran elected a hardliner, Ebrahim Raisi, as President. On Monday, Mr. Biden will welcome President Reuven Rivlin of Israel — a close ally of the U.S. and a major rival of Iran. The two are expected to discuss negotiations for the U.S. and Iran to re-engage in the Iran nuclear deal or the JCPOA (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action), a move opposed by Israel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-air-strikes-hit-iran-backed-militias-in-syria-iraq-pentagon/article35028536.ece

The drills come just days after the British Royal Navy’s HMS Defender passed near Russian-annexed Crimea in the Black Sea, with Moscow saying it fired warning shots at the destroyer to ward it off. The Sea Breeze drills — which have taken place 21 times since 1997 — will involve some 5,000 military personnel from more than 30 countries. The exercises will last two weeks and involve around 30 ships, including the missile destroyer USS Ross. Ukrainian Navy Commander Oleksiy Neizhpapa said during an opening ceremony in Odessa that the exercises would send a “powerful message to maintain stability and peace in our region.” Russia said it fired warning shots last Wednesday at the HMS Defender after what it said was a violation of its territorial waters. Britain said it was making “an innocent passage through Ukrainian territorial waters in accordance with international law.” Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and claims the waters around the peninsula as part of its territory. Most countries do not recognise the takeover and stand behind Ukraine’s claims to the waters. Washington is a key ally of Kiev in its conflict with Moscow over Crimea and pro-Moscow separatist regions in eastern Ukraine. In 2018 Russian forces boarded and took control of three Ukrainian Naval ships off the Black Sea peninsula.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/ukraine-us-launch-black-sea-drills/article35028534.ece
29 June 2021||Baghdad,||Iraq, Egypt and Jordan hold summit||Egypt, Jordan and Iraq agreed to bolster security and economic cooperation at a tripartite summit on Sunday that saw an Egyptian head of state visit Iraq for the first time in three decades. The visits by Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Jordan’s King Abdullah II came as Iraq seeks to move closer to Arab allies of the United States in the Middle East. Iraq is also seeking to establish itself as a mediator between Arab countries and Iran, after reportedly hosting talks in April between Tehran and Riyadh. Mr. Sisi and Abdullah met Iraqi President Barham Saleh and Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi, with Mr. Saleh saying the encounter was “an eloquent message amid enormous regional challenges”. “Iraq’s recovery paves the way to an integrated system for our region built on the fight against extremism, respect for sovereignty and economic partnership,” Mr. Saleh said on Twitter. The summit held between Mr. Kadhemi and his guests broached regional issues, as well as ways of bolstering cooperation between them in the fields of security, energy and trade, according to a joint statement. The leaders discussed a “political solution” to Syria’s civil war based on UN resolutions “that would preserve its security and stability and provide adequate conditions for the return of refugees”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/iraq-egypt-and-jordan-hold-summit/article35028522.ece

Mr. Blinken made the appeal in Rome at a meeting of an 83-member coalition on defeating the extremist network, where he and host Italy called for greater attention to the threat in Africa. About 10,000 suspected Islamic State fighters are being held in northern Syria by Western-allied Kurdish fighters, according to U.S. estimates. “This situation is simply untenable. It just can’t persist indefinitely,” Mr. Blinken said. “The United States continues to urge countries — including coalition partners — to repatriate, rehabilitate and, where applicable, prosecute its citizens,” he said. France, U.K. opposed France and Britain, two of the closest U.S. allies, have been major holdouts against calls to bring back their citizens, which were also made by former President Donald Trump’s administration. Both nations have painful experiences with attacks and see little incentive and plenty of political cost to bringing back radicalised citizens who are already jailed overseas. Mr. Blinken praised Italy as one of the few Western European nations that repatriate its citizens and also hailed efforts by Central Asian nations — such as Kazakhstan, which he said had brought back 600 fighters and their family members and put them in rehabilitation programmes. According to a Human Rights Watch, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces are holding over 63,000 women and children of suspected IS fighters from over 60 nations in two camps surrounded by barbed wire.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-presses-allies-to-bring-back-citizens-who-joined-is/article35028532.ece
29 June 2021||Dhaka,||Bangladesh shuts amid virus surge; migrants’ exodus begins||Thousands of people were stranded in Bangladesh’s capital on Monday as authorities halted almost all public transport ahead of a sweeping lockdown imposed to combat a deadly resurgence of COVID-19 infections. The country reported 119 deaths on Sunday, its highest-ever daily death toll from the pandemic, while new infections have been averaging around 5,000 for the past few days. Officials blame the recent spike in cases on the highly contagious coronavirus Delta variant first identified in neighbouring India. The majority of the South Asian nation’s 168 million population will be confined to their homes by Thursday as part of the restrictions, with only essential services and some export-facing factories allowed to operate. The lockdown announcement sparked an exodus of migrant workers from the capital Dhaka to home villages on Sunday, with tens of thousands of people cramming into ferries to cross a major river. The staggered implementation of the lockdown rules left thousands of workers in Dhaka forced to walk to their offices on Monday, sometimes for hours, in the sweltering summer heat. Large columns of people were seen walking on the main roads early Monday. Workplaces will be shut from Wednesday. Bicycle rickshaws were allowed to operate in a last minute government concession on Sunday, but prices had soared to unaffordable levels, commuters said. “I started walking at 7 a.m. I can’t afford a rickshaw ride,” Shefali Begum, 60, who was going to her daughter’s home in central Dhaka, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/bangladesh-shuts-amid-virus-surge-migrants-exodus-begins/article35028528.ece
29 June 2021||Geneva,||‘Reparations needed for people facing racism’||The UN human rights chief, in a landmark report launched after the killing of George Floyd in the U.S., is urging countries worldwide to do more to help end discrimination, violence and systemic racism against people of African descent and “make amends” to them — including through reparations. The report from Michelle Bachelet, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, offers a sweeping look at the roots of centuries of mistreatment faced by Africans and people of African descent, notably from the transatlantic slave trade. The report, a year in the making, hopes to build on momentum around the recent, intensified scrutiny worldwide about the blight of racism and its impact on people of African descent as epitomised by the high-profile killings of unarmed Black people in the U.S. and elsewhere. The report aims to speed up action by countries to end racial injustice; end impunity for rights violations by police; ensure that people of African descent and those who speak out against racism are heard; and face up to past wrongs through accountability and redress. “I am calling on all states to stop denying — and start dismantling — racism,” Ms. Bachelet said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/reparations-needed-for-people-facing-racism/article35028530.ece

29 June 2021||June 29 2021 00:00 IST,||The law of sedition is unconstitutional||In Vinod Dua’s case (2021), the Supreme Court of India has reaffirmed the law of sedition laid down in Kedar Nath Singh (1962) and directed governments to adhere to it. This reaffirmation seems to be a little problematic. The Kedar Nath judgment upheld the constitutional validity of sedition as defined in Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code. And the Court read down the provision by holding that only writings or speeches which incite people to violence against the Government will come within the mischief of sedition. So, as per this judgment, unless speeches or writings tend to cause violence or disorder, there is no sedition. Issue of ‘disaffection’ Section 124A of the IPC, which contains the law of sedition, categorises four sources of seditious acts. They are, spoken words, written words, signs or visible representations. The gist of the offence is: bringing or attempting to bring the government into contempt or hatred, or exciting or attempting to excite disaffection towards the government. There are three explanations attached to this section. The first explanation says that ‘disaffection’ includes disloyalty and all feelings of enmity. The second and third explanations say that one can comment on the measures of the government or other actions of the government without bringing or attempting to bring it into contempt or hatred or exciting or attempting to excite disaffection towards the government. These explanations do not convey anything different from what the defining section says. Here is an illustration. If a person writes that the Government is very good but the vaccine policy is bad, perhaps he may not attract the charge of sedition as per the explanations. But he should invariably state that the government is very good. If he only says that the policies and actions of the government are consistently bad and does not say that the government is very good, he is liable to be charged with sedition. The recent examples of sedition cases amply prove this point. The Supreme Court’s assertion in Kedar Nath that there is sedition only when writing or speech can lead to violence or disorder has consistently been ignored by governments all these years, and citizens of all ages have been charged with sedition for merely criticising the authorities. The Lakshadweep case is the latest example. The problem actually lies in the fact that the law of sedition was not struck down by the Supreme Court in 1962 as unconstitutional. There was every justification for doing that because sedition, as defined in Section 124A of the IPC, clearly violates Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution which confers the Fundamental Right of freedom of speech and expression, the most valuable right of free citizens of a free country. Not a reasonable restriction Further, this section does not get protection under Article 19(2) on the ground of reasonable restriction. It may be mentioned in this context that sedition as a reasonable restriction, though included in the draft Article 19 was deleted when that Article was finally adopted by the Constituent Assembly. It clearly shows that the Constitution makers did not consider sedition as a reasonable restriction. However, the Supreme Court was not swayed by the decision of the Constituent Assembly. It took advantage of the words ‘in the interest ... of public order’ used in Article 19(2) and held that the offence of sedition arises when seditious utterances can lead to disorder or violence. This act of reading down Section 124A brought it clearly under Article 19(2) and saved the law of sedition. Otherwise, sedition would have had to be struck down as unconstitutional. Thus, it continues to remain on the statute book and citizens continue to go to jail not because their writings led to any disorder but because they made critical comments against the authorities. A few ironies A great irony here is that the law of sedition, which should have gone out of the Statute Book when the Constitution of India came into force, was softened through interpretation and made constitutionally valid by the Supreme Court. This law was enacted by the British colonial government in 1870 with the sole object of suppressing all voices of Indians critical of the government. James Stephen, the author of the Bill, had clarified then that not only critical comments but even a seditious disposition of a person will attract this penal law. It was the policeman who would decide whether a person’s disposition was seditious. The history of this most draconian law during colonial rule would reveal that the basic propositions laid down by Stephen have been followed by courts in all cases on sedition before Independence. In the Bangobasi case in 1891, Bal Gangadhar Tilak’s case in 1897 and 1908 and Mahatma Gandhi’s case in 1922, the High Courts, and ultimately the judicial committee of the Privy Council, consistently held that incitement to violence or rebellion is not a necessary part of sedition under Section 124A of the IPC and a mere comment which the authorities think has the potential to cause disaffection towards the government is seditious and the person can be arrested and put on trial. Justice Arthur Strachey, while stating the law of sedition before the jury in Tilak’s case, had made it absolutely clear that even attempts to cause disaffection would attract the provision, meaning thereby that rebellion, disorder or violence are not an ingredient of sedition. This statement of law by Justice Strachey was approved by the Privy Council. The Supreme Court, while dealing with Kedar Nath , faced a tricky situation. On the one hand, there was the overwhelming judicial opinion saying that in order to attract sedition, a critical comment which causes disaffection towards the government or bring the government into hatred or contempt, is all that is necessary. If this opinion were followed by the Supreme Court, sedition in the IPC would have become unconstitutional. But the top court, for some unexplained reason, did not want to hold it unconstitutional. So, it adopted the reasoning given by the Federal Court in Niharendu Dutta Majumdar vs Emperor in 1942 in which it was held that the gist of the offence of sedition is public disorder or a reasonable apprehension of public disorder. In fact the Privy Council’s statement of law of sedition had clearly held that public disorder was not an ingredient of sedition. The Supreme Court itself admits that the Federal Court did not have the advantage of seeing the Privy Council’s statement of law, otherwise it would have affirmed the Privy Council’s view. Here we cannot miss the irony that the Supreme Court’s attempt to read down Section 124A, to soften it and make its application conditional on public disorder, has made this colonial law constitutionally valid which otherwise it is not. On the other hand, if the judicial opinion on sedition given during the colonial period had been accepted, it would have been held unconstitutional and free India’s citizens would not have been thrown into jails for criticising the governments. Impacting rights In the ultimate analysis, the judgment in Kedar Nath which read down Section 124A and held that without incitement to violence or rebellion there is no sedition, has not closed the door on misuse of this law. It says that ‘only when the words written or spoken etc. which have the pernicious tendency or intention of creating public disorder’ the law steps in. So if a policeman thinks that a cartoon has the pernicious tendency to create public disorder, he will arrest that cartoonist. It is the personal opinion of the policeman that counts. The Kedar Nath judgment makes it possible for the law enforcement machinery to easily take away the fundamental right of citizens. In a democracy, people have the inalienable right to change the government they do not like. People will display disaffection towards a government which has failed them. The law of sedition which penalises them for hating a government which does not serve them cannot exist because it violates Article 19(1)(a) and is not protected by Article 19(2). Therefore, an urgent review of the Kedar Nath judgement by a larger Bench has become necessary. P.D.T.

29 June 2021||June 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Keeping alive conversations about AIDS||Four decades ago, on June 5, 1981, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported an unusual fungal infection of the lungs ( pneumocystis carinii pneumonia) in five gay men in Los Angeles. That was the first time the world learnt about the devastating infection caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in people with a weak immune system. We are in June of another decade and another century, and another virus is haunting us. Clioepidemiology is the study of information from past epidemics for advice about the present. We have dealt with the HIV infection for 40 years. What stops us from drawing from the collective experience of the past and entering this new battlefield against COVID-19 well-armed? Falling short of targets It is widely acknowledged that India scripted one of the biggest success stories in fighting HIV/AIDS between 1997 and 2010, after the infection hit the shores in 1986. The achievement of “controlling AIDS” was flagged by the Centre in 2012 as a small victory in the long journey of accepting, understanding and fighting the disease. But soon, we fell short of our targets. The aim of the World Health Organization, of which India is a member, was to ensure that 90% of the people living with HIV/AIDS are on anti-retroviral therapy by 2020. The target has been pushed by at least five years. Similarly, the 2017 National Health Policy and the UN Sustainable Development Goals aim to end AIDS by 2030. This goal too looks like it may take longer to achieve. Former Union Health Secretary and National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) Director, J.V.R. Prasada Rao, who helmed India’s AIDS response programme till 2017 as Special Envoy to the Secretary General of the United Nations on HIV/AIDS for the Asia Pacific region, fears that the country is at risk of losing hard-won gains. When the COVID-19 outbreak shook the world last year, transferring the blame for unmet targets got easy. But AIDS had actually fallen off the radar long before. And if it is further flushed out of public memory, it will be difficult to check progress on controlling it. How India slipped After years of debate and hard work, India had everything going for it to escalate the fight against HIV/AIDS. The information and education campaigns of the 1990s helped to check the transmission of HIV infection through two routes: mother to child, and blood transfusions. Strict ante-natal protocols were established and blood banks were upgraded with superior testing facilities. The sale of blood was banned. Excellent awareness programmes and intensive follow-up action plans led to significant decline in incidence, but the reduced visibility of the disease led to plateauing of efforts. While politics let AIDS slip from being priority health news, arrogance and complacency of governments between 2013 and 2019 slackened the implementation of AIDS control programmes countrywide. Post-2014 elections, the government was keen to show the world that it was close to beating AIDS, says Mona Mishra, strategic planning consultant (HIV/AIDS project), UNDP. The HIV infection diagnosis rate dropped from 60% in 2010 to 23% in 2019, the mortality rate doubled and new cases spiked five times more during the period. According to NACO’s annual HIV Estimates report of 2019, there were over 58,000 AIDS-related deaths and over 69,000 new HIV infections added to the pool of 2.3 million people living with HIV/AIDS, with 98% of new infections in the high-risk groups. This happened because the campaign to educate and empower the vulnerable communities — MSM (men who have sex with men), IDUs (Injecting Drug Users), migrant and sex workers, and truck drivers — was losing steam. An entire new generation had grown up on Internet knowledge. They were downloading dating apps and hooking up with no awareness of AIDS. Natural desires and sexual behaviour cannot be changed; yet discussions with adolescents on safe sex were buried. Trusting the same formula The pioneers of the AIDS movement understood that a strong political leadership, financial support, advocacy and activism were non-negotiable in the successful handling of the movement. “When the HIV reality was unfolding in India, we did not look at short-term interests but took a long-term view of AIDS beyond the health sector and the socio-economic impacts of the epidemic,” writes Mr. Prasada in his book Celebrating Small Victories: My Journey Through Two Decades of AIDS Response. India needs to keep the conversation going and focus on the broad coalition of economists, scientists, doctors, researchers, technicians, civil society representatives and policymakers, he says. He stresses on the need for a multi-sectoral and multi-pronged strategy to contain AIDS. To fight any medical crisis, we can trust the same formula of supporting science-driven responses, good quality data and empirical evidence; and consolidating guidelines. “There is a road map for reducing new HIV infections by 2030; we only need to repurpose it,” says Ms. Mishra. Good data and information from scientific investigations have to be combined and the Centre needs to provide resources to scale. The nationalised AIDS treatment plan is a perfect example of how early detection, diagnosis and treatment saved many lives. It gave a head start to the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) when every State and Union Territory established its own AIDS control organisation and was given a free hand and funds to monitor the epidemic and work on integrated action plans under NACO’s supervision. Universal precaution and prevention were NACP’s bedrock. Experts say the NACP’s experience in dealing with HIV needs to be tapped into. The existing workforce in 21,000 Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) is well-equipped. They can help in early detection of infections, provide basic information on modes of transmission, promote behavioural change, reduce vulnerability and link people with care and treatment services. A majority of the ICTCs has an excellent outreach in the interiors. The staff can also be easily utilised for dealing with COVID-19 now. At the core of every exit strategy is a strong surveillance system. The government needs to rejig its priorities and re-energise the ICTCs along with the 32,000-plus primary and urban health centres to uphold the right to treatment and the dignity of individuals affected by diseases — AIDS, COVID-19 or any other. For that, acknowledging the existence and enormity of the problem is crucial. Using the available tools in the healthcare system is the best way to mainstream health crises. By integrating education and awareness outreach programmes and re-allocating and releasing funds on time, any chronic (TB/HIV/malaria), acute (cholera/plague) or new outbreak becomes easier to deal with. There is no dearth of experiences to draw from if only we are inclined to learn from our past, rather than forget and be “condemned to repeat it”, in the words of writer-philosopher George Santayana. And that is also why AIDS needs to be back on the agenda. soma.basu@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/keeping-alive-conversations-about-aids/article35028519.ece
29 June 2021||June 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Reopen the files, reconsider privatisation||Privatisation of the public sector, including banks, has been part of the wish list of economic reformers since 1991. This was at the core of the ‘Washington Consensus’. The private sector is inherently more efficient. The ground realities of democratic politics in India, however, kept coming in the way of actual privatisation, though progressive disinvestment of the shares of public sector undertakings in the market has been taking place over the years. The National Democratic Alliance in the early 2000s did undertake some privatisation but had to pause because of political backlash. This was never in the United Progressive Alliance agenda. For six years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also did not consider it important. But it is now being pursued with vigour, has high priority with extremely ambitious targets, reminiscent of the Thatcher era in the United Kingdom. India is right now going through its worst economic crisis. The highest-ever contraction in the economy took place last year, unemployment has risen, incomes for growing numbers are falling, bank non-performing assets (NPAs) may be ballooning, and the fiscal deficit is rising. In these circumstances, it would be prudent to think through the pros and cons of the aggressive privatisation of public enterprises that is on the anvil. There are three categories of public sector enterprises, with each needing its own analysis. Categories, issues, solutions There is the category of enterprises which have been sick for a long time. Their technology, plants and machinery are obsolete. Their managerial and human resources have atrophied. Reviews have come to the same conclusion: these are beyond redemption. They should be closed, and assets sold. But this has been difficult with successive governments as the labour in these enterprises have had a political constituency which has prevented closure. With its political strength, the Government should be able to close these in a time-bound manner with a generous handshake for labour. After selling machinery as scrap, there would be valuable land left. These land values have become high. Prudent disposal of these plots of lands in small amounts would yield large incomes in the coming years. All this would need the creation of dedicated efficient capacity as the task is huge and challenging. These enterprises may be taken away from their parent line Ministries and brought under one holding company which should have the sole mandate of speedy liquidation and asset sale. Then there are enterprises which have been financially sick but can be turned around. Their difficulties can be traced to ministerial micromanagement especially in enterprises with a direct consumer interface. Where private management through privatisation or induction of a strategic partner is the best way to restore value of these enterprises, this should be pursued on priority. Air India and the India Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) hotels are good examples. But these need bold decisions. Air India should ideally be made debt free and a new management should have freedom permitted under the law in personnel management to get investor interest. Once debt free, management control with a 26% stake may be given. As valuation rises, the Government could reduce its stake further and get more money. If well handled, significant revenues would flow to the Government. The Chinese model Then there are many profitable enterprises. Pragmatism instead of ideology should guide thinking about them. The Chinese chose to nurture their good state-owned enterprises as well as their private ones to succeed in the domestic and global markets by increasing their competitiveness in cost, quality, and technology. In the Fortune 500 list, the number of Chinese enterprises is 124, and of these, 91 are state-owned enterprises (https://bit.ly/2Ud8dH6). The Chinese chose to promote both their public as well as their private sector enterprises to rise. Both have made China the economic superpower that it is today. With profitable public enterprises, the Government can continue to reduce its shareholding by offloading shares and even reducing its stake to less than 51% while remaining the promoter and being in control. Calibrated divestment to get maximum value over the medium term after considering market conditions should be the goal instead of being target driven to get a lower fiscal deficit number to please rating agencies. In correct accounting practice, asset sales should not be classified as revenue income for computing the fiscal deficit. In parallel, managements may be given longer and stabler tenures, greater flexibility to achieve outcomes, and more confidence to take well-considered commercial risks. It was done in the past when, say, Maruti was set up. It can be done again. Many have the potential of becoming global champions. They can also be asked to invest patient capital in strategic areas where risk is high and where risk averse private investment may not be easily forthcoming. The Chinese have done this well. Redirect the private sector Outright privatisation has other implications. First, the number of Indian private firms which can buy out public sector firms are very few. Their limited financial and managerial resources would be better utilised in taking over the large number of private firms up for sale through the bankruptcy process and where a paucity of buyers is slowing down the much-needed rapid turnaround of these firms to give a higher growth momentum to the economy. Then, these successful large corporates need to be encouraged to invest and grow both in brownfield and greenfield modes in the domestic as well as international markets. This would be better for India entering a higher growth trajectory with an increase in investment rates which have been falling, than in using their scarce resources for taking over government enterprises with no real value addition to the economy in the near term. Sale at fair or lower than fair valuations to foreign entities, firms as well as funds, has adverse implications from the perspective of being ‘Atma Nirbhar’. Again, greenfield foreign investment is what India needs and not takeovers. Then, there are broader considerations. These enterprises provide for reservations in recruitment. With privatisation, this would end and unnecessarily generate social unrest. In dealing with the novel coronavirus pandemic crisis, the Government has been able to use its ownership to get banks and public enterprises to do so many things on an immediate basis. A similar option does not exist with private enterprises. Would it be in India’s interest to lose the strategic capacity that its ownership of public enterprises including financial ones provide it? It would be better to think carefully now. These are one-way streets where one cannot retrace one’s steps easily.

29 June 2021||June 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Rattling foreign investors||On August 15 last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid down his vision for an AtmaNirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (self-reliant India initiative). He said that India is emerging as a major destination for foreign direct investment (FDI) and is shifting its focus from ‘make in India’ to ‘make for the world’. In pursuit of this ambition, the Commerce Ministry recently reported that India attracted the highest ever FDI of $81.72 billion in 2020-21. However, several economists argue persuasively that the surge in FDI inflows is driven by unprecedented short-term portfolio investment inflows and a few major acquisition deals involving select corporations. An important factor that propels investors to invest in foreign lands is that the host state will keep its side of the bargain by honouring contracts and enforcing awards even when it loses. But when the host state refuses to do so, it rattles the investors, shakes their confidence in the host state’s credibility towards the rule of law, and escalates the regulatory risk enormously. Sadly, to an extent, this has been India’s story over the last few years. Defiance of awards Last year, India lost two high-profile bilateral investment treaty (BIT) disputes to two leading global corporations — Vodafone and Cairn Energy — on retrospective taxation. The responsibility for these two adverse arbitral awards lies at the door of the United Progressive Alliance-2 (UPA-2) government that startlingly amended the tax law retrospectively after losing a case to Vodafone at the Supreme Court. The current government, instead of remedying the past mistake by honouring both the arbitral awards and restoring India’s lost credibility in the eyes of the investor community, continues to exhibit the same defiance. India has challenged both the awards at the courts of the seat of arbitration. While India is well within its rights to do so, it continues to maintain that it ‘never agreed to arbitrate’ a tax dispute – an argument that the Cairn tribunal rejected unequivocally, and rightly so. As India drags its feet on the issue of compliance, Cairn has launched legal proceedings in the U.S. to enforce the arbitral award of $1.2 billion by seizing the assets of Air India. This not only puts Air India in dire straits, especially when the government is attempting to privatise it, but also harms India’s reputation in dealing with foreign investors. The interminable Devas saga The other set of high-profile BIT disputes which stick out like a sore thumb for India arose from the cancellation of an agreement between Antrix, a commercial arm of the Indian Space Research Organisation, and Devas Multimedia, a Bengaluru-based start-up, for the lease of satellite spectrum. The UPA-2 government annulled this agreement arbitrarily on the grounds of national security. This annulment led to three legal disputes — a commercial arbitration between Antrix and Devas Multimedia at the International Chambers of Commerce (ICC), and two BIT arbitrations brought by the Mauritius investors in Devas Multimedia under the India-Mauritius BIT and by Deutsche Telekom, a German company, under the India Germany BIT. India lost all three disputes. The ICC arbitration tribunal ordered Antrix to pay $1.2 billion to Devas after a U.S. court confirmed the award earlier this year. India challenged the Deutsche Telekom tribunal award in the Swiss Federal Tribunal (being the court of supervision of the arbitration) requesting for annulment, but lost the case. After the ICC award, Indian agencies started investigating Devas accusing it of corruption and fraud. In what seemed to be a case of pulling a rabbit out of the hat, last month, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) ordered the liquidation of Devas on the ground that the affairs of the company were being carried on fraudulently. Further, the NCLT directed the official liquidator to prevent Devas from perpetuating its fraudulent activities and abusing the process of law in enforcing the ICC award. This has led to Devas issuing a notice of intention to initiate a new BIT arbitration against India, sowing the seeds for complex legal battles again. Indisputably, transgressions by foreign investors should be dealt with firmly. But a closer reading of these cases reveals that whenever India loses a case to a foreign investor, immediate compliance rarely happens. Instead, efforts are made to delay the compliance as much as possible. While these efforts may be legal, it sends out a deleterious message to foreign investors. It shows a recalcitrant attitude towards adverse judicial rulings. This may not help India in attracting global corporations to its shores to ‘make for the world’, as Mr. Modi correctly aspires.

29 June 2021||June 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Entering the CAPF’s turf||In recent times, whenever personnel of the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) have suffered reverses, there has been an immediate hue and cry, particularly from Army veterans, that the training and skills of CAPF personnel need to be honed. They follow it up with preposterous suggestions that ex-servicemen from the Army should be inducted into the CAPF. Unfortunately, a majority of TV channels invite Army veterans and at times even Air Force veterans to give their ‘expert opinions’ when some attacks by Maoists take place, as was the case in Bijapur on April 3, 2021. In that incident, five security personnel were killed and over 12 injured in an encounter with Maoists. Even senior IPS officers who may never have been involved in combating Maoists in field situations appear on channels to air their ‘expert opinions’. On the battlefront The allegations that CAPF personnel are not well-trained falls flat when we look into the history of these paramilitary forces. Border Security Force (BSF) and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were in the battlefront in the 1971 India-Pakistan war and won medals. As part of the Indian Peace Keeping Force in Sri Lanka, CRPF personnel fought the militants there. Every year, CRPF personnel observe April 9 as Valour Day in commemoration of the incident at Sardar Post in the Raan of Kutch in 1965 when a small contingent repulsed a Brigade strength attack of the Pakistan Army. The CRPF contingent killed 34 Pakistani soldiers and captured four of them alive. Though six CRPF men sacrificed their lives while holding on to the post until reinforcement arrived, the incident found entry into the annals of war history wherein a paramilitary force could inflict heavy casualties on a regular Army Brigade. If the north-eastern States enjoy peace and tranquillity these days, the credit goes in large measure to the CAPF personnel deployed in every State in the region. Though some insurgent outfits are still active in certain parts, they do not pose a very serious threat. In the Punjab, it was the CRPF alongside the Punjab Police that brought the situation under control. Several operations conducted jointly by the CRPF and the Kashmir Police resulted in many losses for the militants and caused little damage to the security forces. This brought a modicum of order in the region. As Deputy Inspector General of Police (Operations) of CRPF in the Valley, this writer along with CRPF Battalions and the Special Operations Group of the Kashmir Police was involved in several operations. In almost all these operations, the security forces emerged unscathed. The Army was never associated in any operations in Srinagar then. A versatile force It is absurd to appoint Army officials as advisers for anti-Maoist operations in the Ministry of Home Affairs. What exposure and experience do they have to combat Maoists? The Army has never fought against the Maoists. What sort of advice can they be expected to render to the experts of the CAPFs in the field who have spent a major part of their lives combating insurgents and extremists? Trained initially by State police officers, the Greyhounds, a specialised commando outfit of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, was able to inflict heavy casualties on Maoists forcing them to migrate to neighbouring States. The elite Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (CoBRA) has played a stellar role in killing some top Maoist leaders and continue to be dreaded by the Maoists. The CAPFs have well-established training centres across the country with instructors of high calibre. Let us not cast aspersions on their training or competence. The fact that they are able to tackle terrorism in Kashmir, fight the Maoists in left wing extremism-affected States, combat insurgency in the Northeast, ensure smooth conduct of elections and control riots across the country speaks volumes about their versatility .

29 June 2021||June 29 2021 00:00 IST,||A case of no case||The sedition case against Lakshadweep film-maker Aisha Sultana has all the undesirable indicators of the misuse of the penal provision: intolerance towards any strident criticism of policy, tendency to discern non-existent threats to the state and deliberate resort to it despite the absence of any ingredient of the offence. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the Kerala High Court has granted her anticipatory bail mainly on the ground that neither Section 124A, which penalises seditious speech or writing, nor Section 153B, which seeks to punish imputations against national integration, is attracted. There may be some cause for those in the Lakshadweep administration to feel aggrieved that the film-maker, in the course of a heated discussion on the policy changes sought to be brought about by the Administrator, accused the authorities of unleashing a “bioweapon” against the people by relaxing quarantine rules for those entering Lakshadweep. However, as the court has rightly pointed out, there is nothing in use of the term that tended to create disaffection against the government or incite the people against it. It ought to have been clear to everyone except the administration, its police and the BJP functionary who complained against her speech that there was no malice or motive to subvert the government established by law. Of course, it is noteworthy that the police did not rush to arrest her, but only issued a notice to her to appear before the police to explain her remarks, indicating that there may not have been a threat of arrest. Yet, the very institution of the case is questionable. It is disconcerting that courts are repeatedly called upon to reiterate that strong speech or writing against government policy is not enough to book someone for sedition, and that only incitement to violence or an inclination to cause public disorder amounts to such an offence. The court considered the political context in which the vehement criticism of the administration has come about. There is much debate about the administrative changes introduced by the Administrator, Praful Khoda Patel, since he assumed office last December. The context, indeed, was the criticism of the modified operating procedure, under which the mandatory provision for quarantining visitors to Lakshadweep was given up. Many attribute the exponential rise in COVID-19 cases to this modification. Another Bench of the High Court has stayed the administration’s order to close down dairy farms run by the Animal Husbandry Department and remove meat from the menu for school mid-day meals. When controversial orders are made, they do have a propensity to attract vehement protests and strident criticism. Unfortunately, the tendency to accuse critics and detractors of having a design to provoke disaffection against the government is spreading among authorities across the country. It is clear the problem lies in the continuance of questionable provisions such as the one on sedition on the statute book.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-case-of-no-case/article35028367.ece
29 June 2021||June 29 2021 00:00 IST,||War of words||IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad’s censure of Twitter, after it temporarily blocked his account upon receiving a notice for copyright violation last week, is valid, but only to an extent. Mr. Prasad was right in calling out Twitter, as he did over a series of tweets, for not giving him prior notice of the blocking, as required by India’s IT Act rules. The blocking was triggered because Twitter had reportedly received a notice for violations under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), filed by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, the content in question being A.R. Rahman’s song ‘Maa Tujhe Salaam’. Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, who is also the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology, replied to Mr. Prasad, saying he had a similar experience. “Locking is a foolish response to a DMCA notice; disabling the video (which they’ve now done) should be enough,” Mr. Tharoor wrote. Having raised the issue, however, Mr. Prasad went on a needless attempt to make the issue look more than what it really is. One of his tweets in this regard was this: “It is apparent that my statements calling out the high handedness and arbitrary actions of Twitter, particularly sharing the clips of my interviews to TV channels and its powerful impact, have clearly ruffled its feathers.” It is quite likely that this is just a case of a global platform struggling to adhere to the laws of multiple jurisdictions where it has substantial interests. Mr. Tharoor’s point in this regard needs highlighting. He tweeted, “But getting a notice from a UK-based organisation, citing @Twitter’s role as a ‘service provider’ under a US law, points to the challenges of @TwitterIndia’s operations in India.” Nothing more needs to be read into it. Mr. Prasad’s outburst is a pointer to the level of deterioration in the relationship between Twitter and the Indian Government. Their already strained relationship has worsened further after Twitter’s defiance in not accepting all of the Government’s takedown requests from time to time. The problematic new IT rules have also contributed to this unease. But then Twitter also has to share some blame. It has opened itself up to attacks from all sides because of its inability to pull down or label problematic content consistently. It has also come across as being indifferent in adhering to the requirements of the new IT rules, including the timely appointment of a grievance officer. On the other hand, it would be best for the Government to just let the rules do the talking rather than take every opportunity to raise the pitch. This only makes it look inefficient and cantankerous.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/war-of-words/article35028368.ece

Krishna Iyer at the Kerala High Court said here last evening that political freedom by itself was not sufficient to complete the revolution to which the Indian people had dedicated themselves. A ballot, he said, was not a bread. It could only bring bread. Speaking on “Fundamental rights under the Indian Constitution and social revolution” at a symposium organised in memory of Mr. C.K. Govindan Nair at the Town Hall, he said that he had always felt when hearing politicians denouncing courts that the judges were more sinned against than sinning. The judiciary did and must occupy the highest place in the constitutional set-up and must play its role in bringing about a constitutional revolution through law so that there might not be any attempt at insurrection by unruly elements in defiance of law. He said the people had waited for long for changes. The signs of ideological violence were symptoms of a deep disease. The challenge of disorder could be met only by a constitutional revolution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/constitutional-revolution/article35028512.ece
29 June 2021||HYDERABAD,||Confident divestment target of Rs. 1.75-lakh crore will be met: CEA||Chief Economic Adviser Krishnamurthy Subramanian has expressed confidence that the Rs. 1.75-lakh crore disinvestment target of this fiscal will be achieved, with a good part coming from the proposed IPO of insurance behemoth LIC and privatisation of Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL). “This year there is actually lot of emphasis on achieving these targets. Lot of work is going on,” he said. While LIC’s public issue and BPCL privatisation are expected to contribute a chunk of the target, from a signalling perspective, Air India’s privatisation is also very important, on which too work is happening, the CEA said. “I think this year very likely will be remembered for privatisation that has been achieved,” Mr. Subramanian said in a virtual interaction with members of the Federation of Telangana Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FTCCI) on Monday. Earlier, delivering a lecture on ‘India’s Economy: Recovery and Way forward’, the CEA said second-generation reforms initiated by the government over the last two years were path-breaking. Stating that enhancing capital expenditure was the best way to grow the economy as it had a multiplier effect, he said the Centre’s impetus to growth driven by infrastructure, and ramp-up in spending since October had accelerated the growth of the construction sector as also created jobs. A spillover effect was growth in consumption, he said, adding that the impact of the second wave was shorter in duration and likely to be muted on the economy as evident from the GST collection figures.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/confident-divestment-target-of-rs-175-lakh-crore-will-be-met-cea/article35028356.ece
29 June 2021||MUMBAI,||Healthcare, travel sectors welcome stimulus||Industry and analysts welcomed the targeted interventions — with a special focus on health and tourism — announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. “The measures to keep enterprises afloat in the aftermath of COVID 2.0 in the form of extending loan guarantees to the healthcare, tourism sectors and small borrowers, in addition to increasing the scope of ECLGS by Rs. 1.5 lakh crore are very welcome steps,” CII president T.V. Narendran said. “The extension of ECLGS’s scope and coverage are expected to provide significant support to the cash flow of the stressed sectors,” he added. Stating that tourism had been one of the most impacted sectors, he said the package would usher in much-needed liquidity and help revive the employment-intensive sector. ‘Mitigating closures’ “Financial support in the form of working capital loans with 100% guarantee to over 11,000 registered tourist guides, travel and tourism stakeholders will help save livelihoods, revive the sector and mitigate further closures and also create new job opportunities,” he added. FICCI senior VP Sanjiv Mehta said, “While some of the existing relief measures have been extended, the focus of the new measures is very well placed. The emphasis laid on the COVID-affected sectors is laudable.” The extension of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Rozgar Yojana until March 31, 2022 should help support additional hiring, he added. The health sector too welcomed steps targeted at this industry. “The allocation of Rs. 23,220 crore towards public health for COVID-care and future preparedness with a special emphasis on pediatric emergency preparedness will bolster efforts for any such healthcare challenges in the future,” said Dr. Prathap C. Reddy, chairman, Apollo Hospitals. Healthcare industry body NATHEALTH president Harsh Mahajan said, “The pinpoint focus on augmenting manpower and infrastructural resources for pediatric care is a welcome step and a new beginning”. He, however, added an increased outlay of Rs. 50,000 crore on scaling up medical infrastructure would be useful in the short term but has to be increased manifold to make up for the neglect of the healthcare sector over the past several decades. “There can be no better time than the present to fulfil the long-pending demand of the healthcare sector to be accorded infrastructure status to enable the nation leapfrog to the next level of healthcare, he added. Rikant Pitti, co-founder, EaseMyTrip, said credit relief will play a crucial role in reviving the tourism sector. “Tourist guides and other travel stakeholders are the backbone of the industry and we believe that the special fund outlay will enable them to rise from the challenges they had faced over the past year and a half.” (With PTI inputs)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/healthcare-travel-sectors-welcome-stimulus/article35028358.ece
29 June 2021||New Delhi,||SAT stays SEBI order on Franklin Templeton||The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) on Monday stayed a SEBI order that had barred Franklin Templeton Asset Management (India) from unveiling new debt schemes for two years and had asked the fund house to refund a little over Rs. 512 crore. Terming the refund amount ‘excessive,’ SAT asked the company to deposit Rs. 250 crore in an escrow account within three weeks. The appeal was filed against an order passed by SEBI on June 7, which said Franklin Templeton violated certain provisions of mutual funds norms in relation to the management of the six debt schemes, which are now shut. Through the order, Franklin Templeton was directed to refund investment management and advisory fees along with interest at 12% a year, amounting to Rs. 512.5 crore. Further, the firm wasprohibited from introducing new debt schemes. In its order, the SAT noted that 21 debt schemes were still being managed by Franklin Templeton and no complaint on these schemes had come to the fore. “The mere fact that the appellant (Franklin Templeton) [has] chosen to wind up six schemes does not mean that they should be debarred from launching any new debt schemes,” the SAT added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/sat-stays-sebi-order-on-franklin-templeton/article35028362.ece

The agency had earlier projected a 4-6% growth in domestic tractor volumes for FY22. “In view of the impact of the second wave, the same has been revised downwards to 1-4%,” ICRA said in a statement. “Downside risks to these estimates emanate from spells of unfavourable rainfall leading to crop damage and a resurgence in COVID cases,” the ratings agency. However, ICRA said given the high base of the previous fiscal, even stagnant volume growth in the current fiscal would still represent very strong volumes for the industry participants. Even as there is uncertainty with regard to the evolution of the pandemic, the underlying demand drivers for the industry remain intact, ICRA said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/icra-trims-tractor-sales-growth-outlook-for-fy22/article35028364.ece

The 30-year-old, who had won World Cup gold earlier in Changwon (2013) and Munich (2019), shot 39 in the final, one short of the world record, to beat Mathilde Lamolle of France by eight points for the gold. In fact, Rahi had sealed the gold even before the last series, as she had an unbeatable six-point lead. “This give me the assurance that I am on the right track. I have to keep working on this,” said Rahi. Shooting five rounds of perfect-5s in the first six series, Rahi intimidated a world class field, which saw the reigning Olympic champion Anna Korakaki being pushed to the fifth place. In sports pistol final, only a score of 10.2 or more is taken as a hit for one point. Seven other shooters put together could muster only two perfect-5s between them in 52 rounds! Bhaker finishes seventh Rahi had qualified with a majestic 591, following 296 in the rapid fire section. Manu Bhaker also shot 296 in rapid fire to qualify for the final with 588, but ended up seventh. It was the second World Cup medal this season for Rahi, who had lost the shoot-off for the gold to Chinki Yadav in the World Cup in Delhi in March. In the women’s 50-metre rifle 3-position event, Tejaswini Sawant (1168) and Anjum Moudgil (1162) returned modest scores. Tejaswini looked set to make the final midway through the standing series, but dropped 14 points in the last two series and slipped to the 20th place.

29 June 2021||(St. George’s,||S. Africa levels series||Spinners were the stars as South Africa rebounded from a hammering in the first encounter of the five-match T20 International series to defeat the West Indies by 16 runs in the second fixture here on Sunday. Defending what appeared to be another modest total of 166 for seven, George Linde and Tabraiz Shamsi combined for three vital wickets in eight economical overs to limit the home side to 150 for nine. It leaves the series locked 1-1 going into the third match at the same venue on Tuesday. Allen’s big hitting Opener Andre Fletcher top-scored for the home side with 35 but it was the late assault by Fabian Allen, who smashed five sixes in 34 off just 19 balls, which caused the only anxiety for Temba Bavuma’s team. With 36 required off the final over from Lungi Ngidi, Allen crashed sixes off the first two balls. However, the pacer held his nerve and dismissed the danger man to put smiles back on South African faces after they saw the West Indies top-order power-hitters at their best in the first match a day earlier when they reached a target of 161 with five overs to spare for the loss of only two wickets. Linde, who earned the man-of-the-match award and dismissed Nicholas Pooran and Andre Russell for final figures of two for 19, said his team’s performance in the first match forced them to take a hard look at themselves. Shamsi’s wrist-spin accounted for West Indies captain Kieron Pollard through four testing overs in which he conceded just 16 runs.  Openers Reeza Hendricks (42) and Quinton de Kock (26) raced along at better than 10 runs per over before they were separated in the seventh over with the score on 73. The visitors were 95 for one at the halfway mark, but could only manage another 71 runs despite a 46 from Bavuma. Obed McCoy finished with the impressive figures of three for 25 from his four overs.  The scores: South Africa 166.7 (Reeza Hendricks 42, Q. de Kock 26, Temba Bavuma 46, Kevin Sinclair 2/23 Obed McCoy 3/25) bt West Indies 150/9 (Andre Fletcher 35, Fabian Allen 34, Kagiso Rabada 3/37, George Linde 2/19). Toss: West Indies; MoM: Linde; South Africa won by 16 runs to level five-match series 1-1.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/s-africa-levels-series/article35028655.ece

29 June 2021||HYDERABAD,||Main objective — avoid early setbacks: Mukesh||India needs to play fearless hockey even while displaying the typical Asian skills to be in with a chance of winning a medal in the Tokyo Olympics, N. Mukesh Kumar, who holds the Games record of scoring the fastest goal — 32 seconds against Australia in the 2000 Sydney edition — said. “India is in a tough group. The main objective should be to avoid early setbacks or else it would have a demoralising effect,” he said in a chat with The Hindu on Monday. “Olympics is a different proposition altogether in terms of pressure and expectations.” Mukesh singled out goalkeeper P.R. Sreejesh as the player to watch out for because of his experience, class and confidence. “He is such an inspirational figure in the team,” he added. “Most of the teams are short of match-practice. It will be interesting to see how the players come up with the required endurance and match-fitness levels. Generally, the preparations include playing in a three-nation event or even Test matches. So, the onus will be on the seniors to raise the bar,” said Mukesh, who featured in the 1992, 1996 and 2000 Games. Demanding task “The coaches, too, have a demanding task of relying a lot on video analysis and their success in translating the boardroom strategies into on-field execution will play a big role in any team’s chances.” Mukesh hoped that the tradition of Olympics throwing up unexpected heroes will continue and India too can have a share of this.  “The emphasis of this Indian team seems to be to send players with the specific direction of going flat out in 10 minutes in any position. “If we are good in this and combine our traditional mastery in skills too, India should be a formidable force,” Mukesh said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/main-objective-avoid-early-setbacks-mukesh/article35028666.ece

(Besides) Jhulan Goswami, the others in the team should be able to step up when they get an opportunity. These conditions assist seamers and they should make use of them.” She admitted India’s batters, who played 181 dot balls at Bristol, should also come up with a better display. Her 72 (108 balls) was the only half-century in the disappointing Indian innings, which laboured to 201 for eight after being put in. “We have to work on rotating the strike,” she said. “We need another top-order batter to get us the runs. But we also need to understand that the England bowlers, especially the seamers, are very experienced. And they know how to bowl in their conditions.” Mithali said the Indian team was more comfortable chasing a target than setting up one. “When it comes to posting a target, I guess there is something we need to work on, how to get to 250,” she said. “We can’t be going bang bang and then lose wickets.” Reshuffle possible She indicated the team could be shuffled for the next game, at Taunton on Wednesday. “We will definitely look into the composition of the team,” she said. “Maybe we would shuffle the batting a little.”  When it comes to posting a target I guess there is something we need to work on, how to get to 250||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/we-need-to-groom-pace-bowling-department/article35028603.ece
29 June 2021||MUMBAI,||T20 WC in UAE and Oman, confirms BCCI||The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has decided to host the T20 World Cup in October-November in the UAE and Oman. BCCI treasurer Arun Dhumal confirmed that the decision was taken because of an expected surge in the COVID-19 cases all over India.  The Hindu understands that the BCCI has formally communicated about switching the venue to the International Cricket Council (ICC), a day before the expiry of the deadline for finalising the venue. On June 1, the ICC had asked the BCCI to confirm the venue within four weeks. “We have discussed the issue with ICC and have had several rounds of discussions internally. After much deliberation, it has been decided that the safety of players and other stakeholders is of paramount importance. Keeping that in mind, it is best that we shift the T20 World Cup to the UAE,” said a letter from the BCCI to the State associations. Interestingly, two separate letters — accessed by The Hindu — with the same content were signed and sent separately by BCCI president Sourav Ganguly and Jay Shah to BCCI affiliates, thus raising murmurs among members about ‘lack of coordination’ among the BCCI top brass. The 16-team event is likely to be played from Oct. 17 to Nov. 14. The eight-team qualification stage is set to be staged in Muscat, the capital city of Oman. Four teams from the preliminary stage will join eight direct entrants in the main event, likely to start on October 24, in the UAE. The fixtures will be formalised latest by July 18, when the ICC’s annual conference will begin.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/t20-wc-in-uae-and-oman-confirms-bcci/article35028607.ece
29 June 2021||PATIALA,||Toor heaves the shot to a meet record||Shot-putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor had set a target of 22 metres even before the National inter-State athletics championships had begun. On Monday, the star from Punjab faltered in that aim but managed to hit the Olympic qualifying mark of 21.10 metres, creating a new meet record in the process. The qualification was not an achievement for the 26-year-old, who had managed it a week ago at the 4th Indian Grand Prix. It was the complete opposite for another Olympic hopeful as javelin thrower Annu Rani from U.P. could only manage a meet record of 62.83m, far below the required 64m mark. She is still likely to make the cut, placed comfortably on the Road to Tokyo rankings, but just one legitimate throw in the last competitive outing before the Games would not be a satisfying result for the National champion. Priya makes her case The women’s 400m was won by Priya Habbathanahally and it remains to be seen if she will be included in the relay team, given the AFI’s strict rules on not considering non-campers. The absence of Hima Das, an off-colour V.K. Vismaya and a disappointing outing by Jisna Mathew in her first race this season may force the federation.  The results: Men: 400m: 1. Kaliga Kumaraghe (SL, 45.73s), 2. Vikrant Panchal (Har, 46.83s), 3. Sarthak Bhambri (Del, 47.25s); 1,500m: 1. Ajay Kumar Saroj (UP, 3:42.55s), 2. Shashi Bhushan Singh (WB, 3:44.19), 3. Rahul (Del, 3:46.17); 4x100m: 1. Maharashtra (41.23s), 2. Kerala (41.99s), 3. Tamil Nadu (42.03s); Long Jump: 1. Mohd. Anees Yahiya (Ker, 7.76m), 2. Yugant Shekhar Singh (UP, 7.63m), 3.

Jyoti (UP, 38:23.21); Javelin: 1. Annu Rani (UP, 62.83m), 2. Sanjana Chaudhary (Raj, 52.65), 3.

The woman concerned held up a banner slightly into the road and was looking straight at the television motorbike cameras with her back turned on the speeding peloton. German rider Tony Martin brushed past her and was knocked off balance racing near the head of the peloton, and when he fell it caused a horrifying domino effect ending in a tangle of bikes and bodies.

29 June 2021||June 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Space for you and space for me||In a 2017 interview, Nigerian author Chimamanda Adichie said, “A transwoman is a transwoman.” Taken by itself, it sounds reasonable — celebrating difference would mean not subsuming transwomen again within the man-woman binary. Unfortunately, the sentence was not a throwaway one — Adichie also said that transwomen start off life with “male privileges”, and later went on to support JK Rowling’s controversial views on transwomen. Despite Adichie’s clarifications, that she meant transwomen’s experiences are different from women’s, her stance has been suspect and she has been labelled a Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist or TERF, someone wanting to exclude transwomen from women’s spaces. The essay Adichie published last week is mostly a defence against her critics, but it’s also a condemnation of the tenor of public debate. Although the piece has been criticised for shifting the spotlight away from transphobia and on to social-media hypocrisy, I believe there are two threads in it and each can be examined, without losing the other. Regarding transwomen, Adichie reiterates her support for their rights, and says, “We should be able to acknowledge differences while being fully inclusive.” How transwomen activists respond to this is for them to say. I will stick to the essay’s social media commentary. Adichie focusses on two of her detractors and her feelings of betrayal. Of one of them she says, “I had a personal relationship with her. She could have emailed or called or texted me. Instead, she went on social media…” One can dismiss this, ask if personal hurt is more important than the larger politics around the issue, but that would overlook the strident intolerance that passes for politics these days. Without personal integrity and adherence to smaller, individual truths and fidelities, one’s public political persona and credo become a largely dishonest construct. Calling someone out in public is easy and conspicuous, but choosing not to is a mark of grace, a quality conspicuously absent in public discourse. On social media, one is perhaps inured to what Adichie calls “the hostility of strangers,” but from friends and acquaintances it is not wrong to expect a call or email expressing frank disagreement. After that, one may part ways, but to willingly choose public attack over private argument signals less political conviction and more a grandstanding for visibility. Calm, private discussions are even more important when the issues are fraught, such as language and identity issues. One of Adichie’s severest critics is Nigerian novelist Akwaeke Emezi, who identifies as non-binary, neither male nor female. Given this, in which context would it be offensive to include Emezi as ‘woman’ and in which context not? Many of us don’t know, many are learning, still gathering the blocks to erect socially just structures. It is merely days since Kiwi weightlifter Laurel Hubbard has become the first trans athlete to be included in an Olympics contest. She will participate in the women’s team, but for that she had to first test with testosterone levels below 10 nanomoles per litre. Arriving here has taken years of negotiation, against prejudices but also against qualms that transwomen will have a physical edge over other women. Language and identity are contested spaces and constantly evolving. We need conversations around them, as around existential questions of rights and livelihoods of all marginalised groups. Social justice cannot be reached only via publicly performed outrage, even though, yes, this is a narcissistic age, and everything from love to lunches is put up on display. Some aspects trouble me especially about public outrage — one is how easily small, individual dishonesties are accepted in the support of a larger cause. I believe this corrupts the very heart of justice. Second, the annihilating language of rage and violence, whose primary goal is not to understand or be understood but to silence. If aggression is all we have to offer at a time when issues of social, gender, political and economic equity are at stake like seldom before, we are impoverished indeed. What Adichie calls “the false gauziness of ideological purity” covers an ulcer of intolerance ravaging social commentary today, its translucence failing to hide the festering lack of humanism underneath. But without empathy and compassion and ordinary, everyday kindness, we are nothing, less than nothing, and ideology alone is not going to make us whole again. Where the writer tries to make sense of society with seven hundred words and a bit of snark.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/space-for-you-and-space-for-me/article35029039.ece
29 June 2021||New Delhi,||Over 250 fined per hour during Unlock 4||More than double the number of people were fined for not adhering to COVID-appropriate behaviour during the fourth consecutive instalment of the unlock process in the Capital last week, as compared to the first. From 124 residents being challaned every hour during Unlock 1, over 251 were fined every hour during Unlock 4 with as many as 6,502 single-day prosecutions on June 27, a Sunday. According to Delhi government records, almost one-third of these prosecutions — for offences ranging from not wearing masks, or wearing them improperly, not following social distancing and spitting in public — were recorded during the seven-day period from June 21 to June 27. After consistently declining for three weeks straight, the number of citizens testing positive for COVID-19, too, increased during the interval. However, this slight increase is attributed to the addition of over 600-old cases to the city’s cumulative tally of infections. From the beginning of the unlock process towards the end of May, Delhi government teams prosecuted 1,29,493 people for not following COVID-appropriate behaviour over four weeks of the unlock process from May 31 to June 6. As many as one-third of these violations, a total of 42,275, were observed and led to prosecution, last week when restaurants and bars among most other economic and commercial activities were allowed to resume after a series of lockdowns between mid-April and May. Phases of unlock Only construction and industrial activities were allowed during the first phase of unlock between May 31 and June 6; 20,966 fines were issued and 3,321 infections were recorded during the week. The second week of unlock between June 7 and June 13, during which the Delhi Metro was permitted to ply and shops at city markets were allowed to open on an odd-even basis, a total number of 29,343 people were prosecuted while the number of infections went down to 2,080. Between June 14 and June 20, when the Delhi Metro continued to function and all shops and city markets were allowed to open irrespective of the odd-even criterion, the number of violations soared to 36,909 even as infections reduced to 1,106. Recorded a surge The fourth phase of the unlock process, during which bars and pubs were added to the list of permitted activities, the number of violations recorded an increase of over almost 15% while the tally of COVID-19 cases witnessed a surge of almost 10% with 1,215 infections during the week. Government sources said the increase in the tally during the week was because of the addition of 477 old cases on June 23 and 170 cases to the tally on June 27. According to government records, the highest number of challans, 6,889, was issued in the South East district followed by 5,995 in Shahdara; at 2,245, the South West district accounted for the least number of fines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/over-250-fined-per-hour-during-unlock-4/article35028868.ece
29 June 2021||GURUGRAM,||Farmer leaders unite against ‘politics of hate’||Krantikar Kisan Union president Darshan Pal on Monday said the farmer leaders would visit Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand apart from other States across the country to expose the Modi government which happened to be the most “anti-farmer” and “authoritarian”, adding that the farmers fight was for “Zameen (land)” and “Zameer (conscience)”. Mr. Pal was speaking at “Kisan Mazdoor Bhaichara Panchayat” at Sunhera in Nuh on Haryana-Rajasthan border. The public meeting was held in the background of two recent tragedies in the area – the kidnapping and murder of Asif, a local youth, and the death of another young man, Junaid, allegedly due to the injuries inflicted in the custody of Faridabad Police – and alleged attempts to communalise the atmosphere. Swaraj India national president Yogendra Yadav exhorted the people to “foil the designs of the BJP and the RSS to disrupt the unity of Mewat region that had very deep historical roots of common sacrifices and common heritage”. After having been unsuccessful in its other machinations to suppress the ongoing farmers agitation they were desperate to disrupt the social fabric by inciting communal violence which was their last resort keeping also in view the impending Assembly elections in some States including Uttar Pradesh, said Mr. Yadav. Bharatiya Kisan Union (Charuni) leader Gurnam Singh Charuni explained that the toiling people remained poor because they were divided on caste and religion. All-India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) president Ashok Dhawale referred to the freedom struggle which had martyrs from different religious communities — Hindu, Muslim, Sikhs — and even tribals that formed a cultural mosaic which was facing its test and needed to be preserved. AIKS Haryana vice-president, Inderjit Singh stated that Mewat region was penalised out of vengeance for its rebellious character first by Britishers and later by successive regimes after Independence in all development matters including irrigation, education, employment and excesses by the police. ‘BJP organised riots’ Young farmer leader Abhimanyu Kohar accused the BJP of organising communal riots in Muzaffarnagar in 2013 and cashing it in 2014 Lok Sabha election. Jagjit Singh Dallewal, Satyawan, Ibrahim Khan, Zafar Yaduvanshi, Ranjit Raju, Satbir Singh and Maulana Saleem were also present.

29 June 2021||New Delhi,||Govt. reduces COVID-19 beds||The Delhi government on Monday reduced the number of beds for COVID-19 treatment in government facilities and allowed for reduction of such beds in private hospitals, according to official orders. On April 18, the Delhi government had directed all private hospitals and nursing homes providing COVID-19-related treatment in the city to reserve at least 80% of their ICU bed capacity and 80% of their ward bed capacity for COVID-19-related treatment, the order said. “It has been observed that there are 22,220 COVID beds vacant and there is a rising demand for non-COVID beds for treatment of non-COVID patients. Hence, keeping in view the large number of unoccupied COVID beds, the competent authority decided that private hospitals having bed capacity of 100 beds or more, oxygen beds may be reduced to 30% of their total bed capacity or three times of occupancy as on June 16, whichever is more. Further, for private hospitals having bed capacity of less than 100 beds will have an option to keep COVID beds in their hospitals,” an order issued on Monday read. A separate order regarding government hospitals, said that due to the “reduction of COVID-19 cases” and “vacancy” of designated COVID-19 beds, the government has decided to reduce the number of COVID-19 beds in the hospitals and COVID health centres under the government. The number of COVID-19 beds in Delhi government-run Lok Nayak Hospital has been reduced to 700 from 2,000, Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital to 150 from 650, GTB Hospital to 600 from 1,800, among others. In total, beds in 20 government-run hospitals and COVID health centres have been reduced to a total of 3,000 beds and 1,620 ICU beds, as per the order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/govt-reduces-covid-19-beds/article35028860.ece

Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta declared that the BJP would continue to stage demonstrations and protests till a criminal case in this regard was registered against Delhi government Ministers and till such time that Mr. Kejriwal was arrested. “Delhi is the only State where during the second COVID wave, the entire healthcare system was crumbling. And the irony is despite all this, Kejriwal was still claiming about Delhi having world-class health facilities,” Leader of the Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/will-continue-to-protest-till-kejriwal-is-booked-says-bjp/article35028866.ece
29 June 2021||New Delhi,||Training course launched to tackle possible third wave||Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Monday launched a certificate course for health assistants, also known as community nursing assistants, to train 5,000 individuals in COVID-related care. The course, which was announced earlier this month, has been launched with an aim to tackle a possible third wave and once trained, these people will assist doctors and nurses in treating patients. The two-week long course launched by Delhi government will include 500 trainees in the first batch, who will be taught about life support, heart functioning, COVID-care, blood testing, sampling, first aid, home care and other procedures. “The trainees will be taught how to measure oxygen, blood pressure, how to inject medicines as well,” an official statement said. The two-week long course is divided into two stages: The first week will be demonstrative training while in the second week, trainees will receive a practical experience. Nine hospitals have been roped in to train them and the Delhi government has disbursed Rs. 5 crore for this initiative. “We want to create a model youth force in Delhi which will be equipped with all the basic skills and knowledge to fight any medical crisis. Not only will our youth be prepared to fight any crisis, they will also be able to provide medical assistance to their family and people in their community,” Mr. Sisodia said. “Within a matter of four days, 1.5 lakh people applied to be a part of this training programme. This indicates that people are enthusiastic to be a part of this course and learn. We plan on scaling this and making it a long-term, ongoing initiative,” he added. Health Minister Satyendar Jain, who was also present, further stated that this course is extremely important to tackle any medical crisis in the future. “This course will be able to provide individuals with employment opportunities considering there is an increasing need of health assistants in hospitals who will be able to assist nurses and doctors,” Mr. Jain said.

29 June 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Ahead of Kejriwal’s Punjab visit, Congress, AAP in war of words||Ahead of Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener Arvind Kejriwal’s visit to Chandigarh, AAP and the ruling Congress were on Monday embroiled in a sharp exchange of words over denial of permission to Mr. Kejriwal’s ‘press conference’. AAP Punjab president Bhagwant Mann said Mr. Kejriwal would visit Chandigarh on June 29, where he would announce a roadmap for the State’s development in the run-up to the Assembly polls, due early next year. Mr. Mann said Mr. Kejriwal would be making ‘big announcements’ about Punjab. “Mr. Kejriwal will announce benefits for the people of Punjab on the lines of unlimited facilities being provided to the people of Delhi. He could also promise to provide free electricity to the people of Punjab and to save them from the costly electricity at present,” he said. Mr. Mann said in Punjab every section of society was suffering due to inflation, but women were the worst affected. ‘More facilities’ “Mr. Kejriwal would release his plan to provide more facilities to women and arrangements for their savings. The government had failed to provide facilities to the people due to which every section was feeling cheated. At present paddy sowing is in full swing but due to non-availability of electricity, farmers are not able to do so properly. Mr. Kejriwal will also present his formula for overcoming the power crisis in Punjab,” he added. Mr. Mann alleged that the Punjab government refused permission for Mr. Kejriwal’s press conference at Punjab Bhawan. “Mr. Kejriwal is coming to expose the lies of Captain Amarinder Singh’s government, and this has scared the government,” he said. However, Capt. Singh, through the official Twitter handle of the Chief Minister’s Office, said the allegation of denying permission to the press conference was “totally not true. We let @ArvindKejriwal address a rally here just few days back so why should we stop him now from having a press conf. If he wants I’d be happy to arrange his lunch too. @AamAadmiParty just wants to do drama even if it means lying.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ahead-of-kejriwals-punjab-visit-congress-aap-in-war-of-words/article35028844.ece

29 June 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Bhubaneswar marching towards completing inoculation by July 31||With vaccination drive accelerated across Odisha, the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Monday exuded confidence that it would complete inoculation of all its eligible population by July-end. The fast-paced drive in the capital city is likely to achieve the target of vaccinating 9 lakh people in a little over month — the first among urban centres in the country. The confidence stems from the fact that 8,47,004 persons have already taken the first dose, which is close to 95% of the total targeted population to be covered under vaccine programme. Similarly, 4,79,647 persons have been administered the second dose constituting 54% of the total targeted population. The targeted beneficiaries of 18 years and above are 9 lakh. The BMC announced to inoculate the rest of the population with the second dose in a month time. “We are targeting to inoculate 28,000 persons aged 18-44 per day by July 3. We intend to complete vaccination of first dose in next five days. Many persons in this group, who are part of health workers and frontline workers, have already been vaccinated. If we complete first dose by July 3, the vaccination in all likelihood will be completed by July 31,” said Mr. Singh. ‘50% vaccinated’ “We are the city with highest percentage of vaccination target already achieved. More than 50% of the eligible population in Bhubaneswar has been vaccinated while in other cities, the vaccination is in the range of 25%,” he said. “Our coverage has been very strategic. We have taken innovative approach by identifying vulnerable groups and potential spreader groups. We have inoculated them in separate camps,” said the BMC Commissioner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bhubaneswar-marching-towards-completing-inoculation-by-july-31/article35028840.ece
29 June 2021||New Delhi,||BJP councillor illegally constructed hotel in Mahipalpur, claims AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party on Monday alleged that BJP councillor and Leader of the House in South Delhi Municipal Corporation, Inderjeet Sehrawat, has “illegally” constructed a hotel ‘The Orient’ in Mahipalpur and the hotel is working without any licence from the SDMC. AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj alleged that Mr. Sehrawat has also “illegally” constructed the third and fourth floors of a DDA flat in Vasant Kunj, but the municipal corporation did not take any action on a complaint lodged regarding it. About the hotel, Mr. Bharadwaj said, “The High Court, too, has asked the municipal corporation to take action and submit an action report on it. If I show you the status of the construction today, the hotel has been fully constructed and is now ready. However, according to municipal corporation’s paperwork, this hotel has been booked and all the construction activities therein have been stopped. And according to the police report, this building has been demolished.” The AAP leader claimed that this property is worth around Rs. 20 crore, but neither the property nor the hotel was mentioned by Mr. Sehrawat in his election affidavit. In a related development, AAP leader Durgesh Pathak said that Delhi can be a world-class city only when both the Delhi government and the municipal corporations are governed by the AAP. ‘BJP shocked’ Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor termed “shocking” that AAP leaders were levelling “baseless charges” on BJP councilors to allegedly tarnish the BJP’s political image. “It is surprising that AAP leader Saurabh Bharadwaj is raising objections on a BJP councillor’s property which he has fully recorded and shown in his IT returns,” Mr. Kapoor said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bjp-councillor-illegally-constructed-hotel-in-mahipalpur-claims-aap/article35028869.ece

A single-judge Vacation Bench of Justice Anup J. Bhambhani was informed by the woman that a conciliation note has been drawn up and filed along with an application seeking disposal of the petition. “Consequent to what was recorded in last order dated June 21, 2021, counsel appearing for the parties inform the court that the complainant and the officer under inquiry have resolved the matter inter-se; and that a conciliation note has been drawn up and filed today along with an application seeking disposal of the petition. “However the conciliation note and application are not on record. Let the same be brought on record,” the judge said. Next hearing The matter has been listed for next hearing on July 5. The High Court on June 21 had issued notice to the Centre on the petition by the senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officer and suggested that in the meantime, the counsel may attempt resolution of the matter, if possible. Senior advocate Rebecca John, appearing on behalf of the petitioner, had told the court that proceedings in the complaint made are underway before the ICC constituted by the Bureau. The lawyer had submitted that all the members of the ICC are subordinate in rank to the DG against whom the sexual harassment complaint has been made. “This is in the teeth of a verdict of a coordinate Bench of this court in Rashi vs Union of India, which mandates that an internal complaints committee must not comprise members who are subordinate in rank to the person who is the subject matter of the complaint before such committee,” Ms. John submitted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/harassment-issue-resolved-with-officer-under-inquiry-woman-ips-informs-hc/article35028863.ece
29 June 2021||JAIPUR,||HC dismisses plea against Jaipur Mayor’s suspension||The Rajasthan High Court on Monday dismissed a writ petition filed by Somya Gurjar challenging her suspension as the Mayor of Jaipur Greater Municipal Corporation earlier this month on charges of manhandling the local body’s Commissioner. Upholding the decision for Ms. Gurjar’s suspension, a Vacation Bench comprising Justice Pankaj Bhandari and Justice C.K. Songara directed the Rajasthan government to expedite the judicial inquiry initiated against her and complete it within six months. The court held that the Mayor was not required to be heard before passing of suspension order. The court also upheld the constitutional validity of Section 39 of the Rajasthan Municipalities Act, 2009, which empowers the State government to suspend a Mayor. The State government had suspended Ms. Gurjar and three municipal councillors — two of them elected on the BJP ticket — on June 6, saying their continuance in office could influence the judicial inquiry. ‘Move without malice’ “We are of the considered view that the decision has been taken after due deliberation and application of mind. After considering the preliminary inquiry report, the decision cannot be said to have been passed arbitrarily or with malice,” the Bench observed in its 31-page order. The Congress government had appointed BJP leader Sheel Dhabhai as the interim Mayor after Ms. Gurjar's suspension.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-dismisses-plea-against-jaipur-mayors-suspension/article35028837.ece

29 June 2021||June 29 2021 00:00 IST,||stardom||In Vasan Bala’s Spotlight, part of Ray , the Netflix anthology adapted from Satyajit Ray’s short stories, a popular actor, Vikram Arora, played by Harshvarrdhan Kapoor, is crippled with artistic insecurity despite his career being on an upswing. His professional anxieties get progressively worse when the hotel that he’s staying at is pretty much hijacked by a religious leader, Didi (Radhika Madan), who commands outsized influence on politicians, business leaders, film producers, and the general populace. In the course of the film, Kapoor’s character must come to terms with the limitations of movie stardom and the realisation that between cinema and religion, two factions that enjoy a colossal hold over the Indian psyche, religion will always trump the former. While the film has an undercurrent of dark commentary, the treatment itself is lighthearted and Bala, who earlier directed the festival darling Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota, peppers the narrative with a variety of inside jokes. For instance, Kapoor’s manager, played by an astute Chandan Roy Sanyal, takes a dig at Inlaks, a housing society in Mumbai’s Versova known for aspiring actors who are yet to break through, as well as Scrumptious, an eatery nearby largely frequented by the same crowd. In the film’s context, Sanyal’s dig is at the star who’s refusing a lucrative part that will bring in the money, the suggestion being that if he doesn’t take the gig, he may have to go back to the life of a ‘struggler.’ “It was a line improvised by Chandan,” Bala, whose last film too was seeped in cinephilia, says over a Zoom call. “All the cinephilia is almost like a personal trip for me. If nobody finds out [the references] it’s fine, the story will still hold on its own.” Which it does, except it’s a much more joyful experience once the jokes are understood. Kapoor, who plays an actor grappling with stardom, says that he was thrilled to have that experience, as it’s something that has, so far, eluded him. “He [Vikram Arora] has captured the imagination of the paying public in a way that I haven’t done. I enjoyed living in that world. Actors are an insecure lot. The job entails failure, rejection and insecurity. The call from Vasan came during the first wave when everybody was anxious about the future, grappling in uncertainty. So I ended up channeling that nervous energy into the part.” A little bit ofEntourage Kapoor points out two characters, Johnny Drama and Vincent Chase, from the show, Entourage — about the life of a Hollywood star and his coterie — which percolated into Spotlight. While the film draws parallels between a cult leader and a movie star, another aspect that runs through the narrative is the cost of fame and how debilitating it can be psychologically for those who live and die under the constant glare of the public eye. As an artist, does Kapoor crave that popularity? “Honestly, that power would just liberate me to do films like Spotlight, Bhavesh Joshi and AK vs. AK . I told Vasan this: I don’t only want to be an option for you when you’re making a film with a Rs. 5 crore budget. I also want to be an option when you’re making a Rs. 50 crore-plus film. If I’m lucky enough to achieve that kind of power, I’d want filmmakers to tell different kinds of stories at a bigger scale. That really can be the best by-product of stardom.” While that’s a noble aspiration to chase, the flip side could be that stardom could imprison the star, making them a victim of their own image. One of the reasons why we see a lot of top stars repeat what they’ve done in the past is because they chase stories that serve their stardom and not the other way round. “That’s a good point. Given the lineage that I come from, I have felt that weight. But I haven’t let that affect my choices, whether it was doing a film festival musical as my first film or a vigilante drama disguised as an action film as my second.” Sanyal says he did draw some nuances from Ari Gold, the agent character from Entourage , but his primary source was Asrani’s character from Hrishikesh Mukherjee’s 1973 film, Abhimaan , and Rabi Ghosh, the Bengali actor who did several films with Satyajit Ray. Great art vs fame Akansha Ranjan Kapoor, who plays Anuya, Kapoor’s partner, and acts as his moral compass and a voice of reason, says that Bala isn’t a director who rehearses too much. The idea is to be on set and react to the moment. Even their interpersonal dynamic reflected in the film is the way it really is. “Harsh knows so much about cinema and I’m pretty blank. I think that method found its way into the film,” she says. To this, Bala adds, “With Vikram and Anuya, what I really like is that one is trying to be an artiste but is popular and hence the problems in his life. Anuya doesn’t have such issues. She’s pragmatic, wants to earn her money, and live her life. She’s not even having those artistic battles. She sleeps better and he doesn’t.” Which brings us to a long unanswered argument that the film dabbles in. Does great art inherently come at the cost of sacrificing popularity and mental peace? “It’s a classic choice,” Bala says. “Till things are working for you, it’s great. There’s Barfi, there’s Rockstar. .. all happening at once. And then comes Bombay Velvet a nd people like me come in,” he laughs, referring to Ranbir Kapoor’s career that took a brief nosedive with the Anurag Kashyap directorial. Vasan was one of the writers of the 2015 film. “When you’re used to popularity and fame, the shift is difficult. It takes a lifetime to balance it out. Either you chase stardom or stardom chases you.”  Ankur Pathak is a writer based out of Mumbai, who was formerly the entertainment editor of HuffPost India.
