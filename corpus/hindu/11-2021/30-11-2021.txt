30 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Parliament clears Farm Laws Repeal Bill without a debate||The Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021 was passed by both Houses of Parliament on Monday without discussion amid protests by Opposition MPs on being denied a debate. On the first day of the winter session, as expected, the Government had listed the Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021 for taking back the three contentious farm laws — Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 — but it was not clear that any debate would be allowed before the repeal. Opposition leaders had expressed apprehension even before the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) meetings of both Houses that the Government would want to clear the Bill without discussion. No consensus on a discussion was reached in the BAC meeting. In the Lok Sabha which was adjourned till 12 noon after it convened due to ongoing protests by the Opposition on farm Bill related issues, the Repeal Bill was taken up as soon as the House reconvened. Opposition MPs from the DMK and the Trinamool were in the Well when Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar stood to introduce the Bill, demanding that discussion be allowed. Congress MPs were in their seats but they too raised the demand for a discussion. Speaker Om Birla said unless the House was in order he would not allow a discussion. “I will allow the discussion only when the House is in order,” he repeatedly said and asked Mr. Tomar to proceed first with introducing and then taking up the Bill for consideration and passing. Leader of the Congress Legislature Party in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Choudhary intervened stating that in the past, six Acts had been repealed since 2014, and discussion had been allowed for the same and that this Bill too should come up for debate. “The word here is consideration and passing, and we ask that the bill be taken up for consideration by the House before passing,” he said. Speaker Om Birla, however, said no discussion could take place with parliamentarians crowding the Well of the House. “This is not the way one can debate bills,” he said. The Bill was then passed by voice vote and the House adjourned till 2 p.m. In Rajya Sabha, after two adjournments in the first half of the day, the House met at 2 p.m. to repeal the laws.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/parliament-clears-farm-laws-repeal-bill-without-a-debate/article37763150.ece
30 November 2021||Bengaluru,||Private schools revert to online classes||Many private school managements have decided to revert to online classes after they recorded a significant dip in attendance on Monday. Parents are worried about clusters of COVID-19 infections cropping up in educational institutions, said school principals. Uncertainty of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus has also fuelled fears. Some schools announced that physical classes would resume in January, while others have postponed it indefinitely. Lokesh Talikatte, State unit president, Recognised Unaided Private Schools' Association, Karnataka, said that its affiliated schools had stopped offline classes. “After many media reports, parents are worried and are not keen on sending their children to school. We had to restart online classes in many schools, particularly in Bengaluru,” he said. In a message to parents, Swargarani School in Rajarajeshwari Nagar informed parents that the school management had decided to continue with only online classes from December 1; there would be no offline classes. “We are glad that the school took this decision. Although the school follows all the precautions, we think it’s risky to send our children back as they are not vaccinated,” said a parent. Mansoor Ali Khan, member, board of management, Delhi Public Group of Schools, said that they had initially decided to begin offline classes on January 3. “We will now, however, postpone it indefinitely till the situation gets better,” he said, adding that they will stick to online classes for the time being. Sumanth Narayan, founder of Shanthinikethana School, said that he consulted paediatricians and is considering a proposal to conduct classes for only half a day. “We are however in a dilemma as we are torn between protecting students’ health and their academics. If we conduct classes only for half a day, the learning gap among students which is now being addressed by teachers, will increase further,” he said. Government-run schools do not have the luxury of reverting to online classes. Nagasimha G. Rao, Director of Child Rights Trust, said it was imperative for the Government to chalk out an academic plan for their students in the event that schools are asked to shut again.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/private-schools-revert-to-online-classes/article37763189.ece
30 November 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Enhanced vigil against Omicron: Veena||Kerala has taken all precautions for enhanced disease surveillance now that the presence of the new SARS-CoV-2 variant Omicron has been confirmed in many world nations, said Health Minister Veena George here on Monday. All precautions have been taken in line with the directives issued by the Centre. Surveillance is being stepped up at all four international airports in the State and all international travellers, especially those coming from Europe, the United Kingdom, and 11 other nations deemed to be at “high risk”, will be put under surveillance. The travellers coming to the State from these nations will have to undergo RT-PCR testing at the airports as soon as they land and they will have to go in quarantine for seven days even if they test negative for COVID-19. They will have to do an RT-PCR test again on the eighth day and be in self-observation mode for another seven days. In case any of these travellers tests positive for COVID-19, he/she will be isolated in a separate ward and treated, Ms. George said. Self-observation The State has been continuously doing genomic sequencing surveillance for the past one year. In the new situation, 5% of random samples from travellers from nations other than the “high-risk” countries will also be sent for genomic sequencing, as directed by the Centre. In general, all international travellers coming to the State will have to be in self-observation and isolation mode for seven days, she added. More staff at airports The Health Department has posted more staff at the airports now to enable the enhanced surveillance and testing. While there is no need to press panic buttons now, people should continue to maintain all universal precautions against COVID-19 – masking, physical distancing and avoiding crowding – strictly and those who have not completed their vaccination against COVID-19 should do so without delay. At present, over 96% have completed the first dose vaccination and close to 64% have been fully vaccinated. With the help of local bodies, health workers at the grassroots are trying to directly get in touch with those who are due for the second dose and trying to expedite the uptake of the second dose. Ms. George said the State had already started its preparations in hospitals to meet any exigency that might arise out of a third wave and, as part of this exercise, almost all hospitals had become self-sufficient as far as oxygen requirement was concerned. Better care at Attappady In the case of the infant earths at Attappady, the Health Department and the Department of Welfare of Scheduled Tribes are jointly working to improve the facilities at the Kottathara Tribal Specialty Hospital for giving better care for mothers and children, she said.  5% of samples from travellers from nations other than the “high-risk” countries will be sent for genomic sequencing||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/enhanced-vigil-against-omicron-veena/article37763450.ece
30 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Crypto trade not tracked: Govt.||The government doesn’t collect information on cryptocurrency or Bitcoin transactions in the country and has no plans to recognise Bitcoin as a currency, the Finance Ministry told Parliament on Monday. Responding to separate queries from Lok Sabha MPs on the booming trade in cryptocurrency in the country and whether the government has legally permitted their exchanges to do business, the Ministry said ‘cryptocurrencies are unregulated in India’ and it ‘does not collect information’ on their trading. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das has been raising serious concerns about cryptocurrency in the context of macroeconomic and financial stability and has called for more ‘well-informed’ public discussions to understand the ‘far deeper issues’ involved. The government has plans to introduce a Bill to regulate cryptocurrency. It might possibly ban all private cryptocurrencies and facilitate the creation of the official digital currency, in the ongoing winter session of Parliament. Last month, the RBI, which is eyeing a pilot project for a central bank digital currency (CBDC), urged the government to amend the RBI Act of 1934, Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary said in response to a query. The law will need to be changed to enhance the scope of the definition of a ‘bank note’ so as to include digital currency. “RBI has been examining use cases and working out a phased implementation strategy for introduction of CBDC with little or no disruption,” the Minister said, adding that an official digital currency can potentially provide significant benefits, such as reduced dependency on cash, higher seigniorage due to lower transaction costs and reduced settlement risk. “Introduction of CBDC would also possibly lead to a more robust, efficient, trusted, regulated and legal tender-based payments option. There are also associated risks which need to be carefully evaluated against the potential benefits,” he noted. As per the available purport of The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021, the government may ban all private cryptocurrencies in India, while allowing for ‘certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses’. Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently held a meeting with top officials from the central bank and the Ministries of Home Affairs and Finance on cryptocurrencies and expressed concerns about attempts to mislead the youth through over-promising and non-transparent advertising. Bitcoin scam On the Bitcoin hacking scam in Karnataka, the Finance Ministry said a case has been registered by the Bangalore zonal unit of the Enforcement Directorate, It added that any further disclosure of information in the matter is ‘not in larger public interest’ and put the onus on the State for probing the criminal aspects of the case. “Information in public domain suggests that a case of cybercrime involving Bitcoin has been under examination by the Karnataka police. ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order are State subjects as per the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India,” Mr. Chaudhary said in reply to an unstarred question on the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/we-dont-track-crypto-trading/article37763152.ece
30 November 2021||Vijayawada,||Govt. plans to install water gauging system: Jagan||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Monday told the inter-Ministerial Central team, which visited the flood-hit areas in Chittoor, Kadapa and Nellore districts, that the State government planned to install an automatic water gauging system and to increase the discharge capacity of canals as long-term measures required to combat climate change and its impact. In a meeting with the Central team, which was led by National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) adviser Kunal Satyarthi, at his camp office, Mr. Jagan sought an ad hoc replenishment of the State Disaster Response Force funds, which had depleted over the years, as resources were needed to carry out relief and rehabilitation (R&R) works on such a large scale as in the present instance. The Chief Minister requested the Central team to be compassionate and humanitarian in their approach to extending financial assistance to the State so that it could do its best to the people, particularly farmers, who were hit hard by the floods. ‘Classic flood’ Presenting an overview of the disaster, Mr. Satyarthi said he would define it as a “classic flood” in the context of the floods experienced in Assam, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, and suggested that the governments should gear up to tackle more such adverse events which were apparently due to the major global shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. He observed that the river systems in the semi-arid Rayalaseema region were not prepared to get such massive quantities of water, which was a phenomenon of ‘non-water areas’ receiving water beyond their carrying capacity. There was widespread damage to agricultural fields and infrastructure up to 3 km on both sides of rivers, Mr. Satyarthi said. Meanwhile, in a video-conference with Collectors of Anantapur, Chittoor, Kadapa and Nellore districts, Mr. Jagan said they should do all that is possible to mitigate the woes of people, who were still reeling under the impact of the rains that pounded the region.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/state-government-plans-to-install-an-automatic-water-gauging-system-jagan/article37763144.ece
30 November 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||High Court adjourns all capital cases to December 27||A full Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra, on Monday adjourned all the three capitals cases to December 27 in order to have a clear picture on A.P. Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Repeal Bill of 2021, which is awaiting the Governor’s assent. Advocate-General S. Sriram argued that there could not be a pre-emptive adjudication of any issues by the High Court at this stage as they were in the domain of the Legislature. He insisted the court could not accept the contention of the petitioners about the continued relevance of their writ petitions until Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan, who is currently indisposed due to post-COVID symptoms, gives his assent to the Bill, and that there was no guidance role for High Court in relation to the Legislature's future course of action. Representing the petitioners, senior advocates Shyam Divan, Jandhyala Ravi Shankar and B. Adinarayana Rao said not only the State’s legislature but also its executive competence should be taken note of from the perspective of the Union, State and Concurrent lists of the Constitution. Some other counsels said the Decentralisation and CRDA Repeal Acts of 2020 were withdrawn for the purpose of disabling the High Court from proceeding further. Moreover, the government made clear its intention to revert with a fresh Bill on decentralisation. Chief Justice Mishra rejected the argument by saying that parties to a litigation could always decide its course in accordance with law and pointed out that the Bill for repeal of the principal Acts was presented after the same was informed to the High Court. The petitioners’ advocates appealed that the court should undertake an adjudication whether the legislature had the competence to change the capital. They maintained that the Legislature did not have the power to bring the decentralisation Act, therefore, repealing the same was also not in its powers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/andhra-pradesh-hc-adjourns-all-capital-cases-to-december-27/article37763207.ece
30 November 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,||Two workers die at Ramky Pharmacity in Vizag||Two workers aged around 25 years died under mysterious circumstances after reportedly inhaling some poisonous gas near the pump house of the effluent treatment plant at Ramky Pharmacity in Jawaharlal Nehru Pharma City (JNPC), Parawada, here, in the early hours of Monday. The deceased have been identified as Manikanta and Durga Prasad, contract workers. According to managing director and CEO of Ramky Pharmacity P.P. Lal Krishna, the pharma city had one common effluent treatment plant for around 100 companies housed in the facility. Except for about 10 to 15 companies, the effluents from the companies flow into the treatment plant through pipelines using gravitational technology. A pump is used to draw the effluents into the tank for the firms, said Mr. Krishna. On Monday, the two workers went to check the working of the pumping process. While one of them was at the pump, the other who had gone to check the levels of the tank fell unconscious near the manhole of the tank. Seeing his fellow workman falling down, the other rushed to his rescue and he too fell down unconscious, he said. According to the police, the watchman present at the site informed the management, and the officials immediately rushed to the spot and sent the unconscious workers to a private hospital in Gajuwaka. But on the advise of the hospital, they were shifted to a corporate hospital. Upon reaching the hospital at Sheelanagar, both workers were declared brought dead. The police and Ramky officials are investigating the cause of death. “It is mystery even for us and we are trying to find out what they inhaled,” said Mr. Krishna. The bodies were shifted to King George Hospital (KGH) for postmortem. Meanwhile, a few workers associations blamed the management for negligence and not taking adequate safety measures, which might have led to the incident.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/two-workers-die-in-pharma-cluster-in-vizag/article37763105.ece
30 November 2021||MANGALURU,||Dial 112 ERSS to receive 24x7 complaints on cyber crime across State by Jan.-end||By the end of January next year, Dial 112 Emergency Response Support System (ERSS) can be used by people across the State to immediately report losing one’s money or any other cyber crime at any time in the day. At present, the helpline of the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal (155260) of the Ministry of Home Affairs is available between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. “We are working on co-locating 112 with 15520 and make available the service to reporting cyber crime 24 x 7. In another two months, people across the State can call 112 and report cyber crime,” Director-General and Inspector-General of Police Praveen Sood told The Hindu . Mr. Sood said that the State Police strongly believes in “CIR (Cyber Information Report) before FIR (First Information Report)” by which they want to cut down drastically the time gap between the offence and its reporting, which is critical for providing relief to the victim. “We are bringing a paradigm shift to adopt a victim-oriented approach in cyber crime,” he said. As it is critical to provide treatment for an ailing patient in the golden hour, in cyber crimes too, it is important to act quickly act to stop transfer of money that is siphoned off from one’s account,” Mr. Sood said. Since December 2020, the Bengaluru Police have been receiving cyber crime complaints on Dial 112. In the last 11 months, the police stopped transfer of nearly Rs. 70 crore that belonged to about 7,000 people. A centralised Dial 112 is available across the State and on an average, 60,000 calls are being made per day to seek assistance for crime, accident or other emergencies. Mr. Sood said that the police will shortly train personnel handling 112 in registering CIRs. People are calling the helpline of the national portal to report cyber crime. Soon after details are entered in the portal, it immediately goes to the bank concerned that takes action to temporarily stop the transfer of the amount. A unique ID then is sent as an SMS to the complainant who uses it to access the portal and provide more details of the offence. This information goes to the police station concerned which then registers an FIR.   We are working on co-locating 112 with 15520 and make available the service to report cyber crime 24 x 7, Praveen Sood,  Director-General and Inspector-General of Police||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/dial-112-to-report-cybercrimes/article37763205.ece

Airport sources said the level of departures was 60 per day in the pre-COVID-19 days and normal operations were expected to be restored by December 15.

There is high alert at the airport over the COVID variant. Passengers from countries such as South Africa, Botswana, Brazil, Hong Kong, Bangladesh, Mauritius, China, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, and Israel will now have to undergo RT-PCR tests and remain in quarantine for seven days. CIAL sources said domestic flight operations had touched about 80% of the pre-COVID level. Recent days had seen around 38 departures compared to the 40 to 45 departures during the pre-pandemic days. The airport is now handling around 6,000 passengers per day in departures alone, and the total passenger traffic is around 12,000 per day compared to 15,000 passengers per day in the pre-pandemic days. Cargo operations at CIAL too have reached near normality, with around 110 tonnes of products being shipped out of the airport on a daily basis.

Suhas was cited in a communication as saying that the Chairman of the airport and members of the board of directors took proactive steps to re-establish air connectivity to Kochi from all international travel hubs. “We are extremely happy to have Singapore Airlines here after a 20-month hiatus,” he said. The communication said passengers arriving from Singapore would have to take RT-PCR test at the Kochi airport and undergo seven days of home quarantine. On the eighth day of arrival, they will have to take another test and continue quarantine for another week if found positive.

30 November 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Jose K. Mani elected to Rajya Sabha||The Kerala Assembly on Monday elected Jose K. Mani of the Kerala Congress(M) to the Rajya Sabha. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan congratulated Mr. Mani for his victory in a FB post. Mr. Mani’s defection to the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and subsequent resignation of the Rajya Sabha seat he won on a United Democratic Front (UDF) ticket in 2018 had prompted the byelection. His tenure in the upper House will end in 2024. Wins by 41 votes Mr. Mani, who represented the ruling LDF, defeated Sooranadu Rajasekharan, fielded by the UDF Opposition, by 41 votes. The electoral college comprised 140 legislators, of which 137 exercised their franchise. As per tentative voting figures, 40 MLAs voted in favour of the UDF candidate and 96 in favour of the LDF. Legislative secretary Unnikrishnan Nair, who is the returning officer, declared one vote as invalid. UDF booth agents N. Shamshudeen and Mathew Kuzhalnadan, both MLAs, objected to the purported LDF vote based on the arguably erroneous marking on the ballot paper. The returning officer sealed the ballot in an envelope for further examination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/jose-k-mani-elected-to-rajya-sabha/article37763446.ece

A Division Bench comprising Justice S. Sunil Dutt Yadav and Justice S. Rachaiah passed the order on a habeas corpurs petition filed by the mother of the girl. The mother had alleged that someone had kidnapped her daughter, but the police had failed to take action on the complaint. When the police produced the girl before the Bench, the girl declined to go with her parents while alleging that she had left her parents’ house on her own and had gone to her brother’s house in Goa as she wanted to continue her studies and was not ready to get married. Though her parents filed an affidavit before the court that they would not pressurise her to get married and will allow her to continue her education, she told the court that she is prepared to stay in a Government children’s home instead of going with her parents. Following the voluntary statement given by the girl, the court directed the police to send her to the Government children’s home in Gadag while asking the authorities to ensure her lodging and safety till she turns 18. The authorities were also directed to provide her facilities to continue her education. Meanwhile, the court granted visiting rights to her parents if the girl wishes to meet them while also giving the girl the liberty to go with her parents if she changes her mind.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-lets-minor-stay-in-childrens-home-as-parents-want-her-to-get-married/article37763182.ece

Attingal, Nedumangad, Neyyattinkara, and Kovalam would also linked in due course. He added the KSRTC had adopted IT-enabled facilities, including smart card, GPS, and vehicle tracking application, as part of the circular service. The Grama Vandi scheme that would connect villages having no bus services would be launched in April. Mr. Raju added the long-pending wage revision of KSRTC employees would be finalised in December.

30 November 2021||New Delhi,||12 RS MPs suspended for ‘misconduct’||Twelve Opposition members of the Rajya Sabha were suspended for the entire winter session on Monday for “unprecedented acts of misconduct”, “unruly and violent behaviour” and “intentional attacks on security personnel” on August 11, the last day of the previous monsoon session. Following the decision, the Opposition was mulling several options including boycotting the entire winter session of Parliament. This is the first time members of the Rajya Sabha have been suspended for misconduct during the previous session. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi said that the incident happened on the last day of the monsoon session and therefore no action could be taken at that time. Opposition parties described the move as “authoritarian”, “unwarranted” and “undemocratic”. Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge held a hurried meeting of Opposition parties to frame their reaction to the unprecedented suspension. He has also called a meeting of floor leaders of the Opposition parties on Tuesday to decide their response.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/12-rs-mps-suspended-for-misconduct/article37763151.ece

30 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC asks Govt. to clear the air on construction activities in Delhi||The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Centre to clear the air on construction activities in areas falling within its domain in the National Capital amid a clamour in court that the Central Vista project was proceeding “full steam” despite the re-imposition of a building ban by the Supreme Court to loosen pollution’s iron grip on Delhi. A Special Bench led by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana directed the Centre to respond by December 2, the next day of hearing. “Despite your [Supreme Court’s] ban, the Central Vista work is going on... Lives of people should be more important than the Central Vista! The Central Vista work is on full steam right under the nose of the Supreme Court,” senior advocate Vikas Singh, for the petitioner side, submitted . The court had re-imposed construction ban in Delhi NCR as an interim measure on November 24. However, in its order, the court noted that "Mr. Vikas Singh has raised certain issues with regard to construction activities being carried out in the NCT of Delhi, which according to him, is the major cause of air pollution in Delhi... Solicitor General is directed to file response to the submission made by Mr. Vikas Singh and get instructions in this behalf on the next date of hearing," the court ordered. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for the Centre, questioned the intentions of the petitioner in focusing only on the Central Vista work. The Supreme Court had earlier given the green signal for the project in the heart of the power corridors of the Capital. Chief Justice Ramana said the focus of the court was pollution, pure and simple. “We will not let anyone go. If the pollution has to do with Central Vista, we will ask him [Mehta]... Our focus is on pollution, whether it has to do with the Centre or the States,” the CJI reacted orally to Mr. Singh’s submissions. Task force The court said it would be forced to set up a “task force” if the States did not fully implement the directions of the Centre’s Air Quality Commission (AQM) to cut pollution. “If the States are unable to take action, we will be forced to create an independent task force,” Chief Justice Ramana observed orally. Mr. Mehta explained that the Commission had given direct instructions to the States after consulting with the Chief Secretaries and authorities of States, including Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Haryana. “Right from the beginning we have been engaging with them. Some directions are only partially complied or we are not informed about compliance... The gaps need to be breached... Directions have to be implemented...,” Mr. Mehta submitted. The court directed Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab to file affidavits showing their compliance with the directions issued by the Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas. The Bench pointed out that the quality of air continued to be a severe 319 points.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-asks-govt-to-clear-the-air-on-construction-activities-in-delhi/article37762911.ece
30 November 2021||New Delhi,||Government ready to discuss all issues: PM||In his customary remarks before the start of the winter session of Parliament, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday that his Government was willing to answer any questions and allow any debates, but all parties should maintain the dignity of Parliament and the Chair in both Houses. “Government is willing to discuss every issue with an open mind and is ready to answer any question. We want that there be questions on the Government, but that order is maintained as well. Voices can be raised against the Government and its policies, but the dignity of the House, the Speaker’s Chair must be maintained,” he said. This was in reference to the disruptions that marked the last session, especially in the Rajya Sabha, over the three farm laws. He urged lawmakers to keep the common man at the centre of deliberations in the House. Referring to the recent observance of Constitution Day on November 26, Mr. Modi said it had been observed in the spirit of the Constitution and a renewed resolution. “Against this background and that of the 75th anniversary celebrations of India’s freedom, everyone wants that India’s Parliament keeps the spirit of freedom fighters alive by debating issues of national interest and further the country’s progress,” he said. He also sounded a note of caution on the Omicron variant of COVID-19 making its way around the world. “The new variant enjoins that we observe extreme caution and I urge you all to do the same,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/government-ready-to-discuss-all-issues-pm/article37763077.ece
30 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Omicron risks spark call for booster dose||With the emergence of Omicron and its virulence yet uncertain, concerns have emerged about whether a third dose of COVID-19 vaccines should be administered in India. The United States and the United Kingdom have approved booster doses for all adults, six months after the completion of their second dose. In the U.K., however, it is restricted to those 40 and above, or those with clinical conditions that suppress their natural immunity. These recommendations build from research suggesting that two weeks after a booster, the chances of being protected from symptomatic COVID increase. A study in Israel also suggests that immunity against infection dips noticeably in the six months after two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Compared with people who got only two doses five months prior, those who got three doses of the vaccine had a 93% lower risk of COVID-19-related hospitalisation, 92% lower risk of severe COVID-19 disease, and 81% lower risk of COVID-19-related death. Vaccine effectiveness appeared consistent across sexes and age groups (ages 40-69 and 70-plus) and number of comorbidities. “With Omicron, the Government of India must, without any delay, make it possible for all senior citizens and those with comorbidities irrespective of age, to get a third or ‘booster’ dose of the relevant vaccine. In fact, the Government should enable, encourage and assist them in getting that on a war-footing. Not doing that would be a policy folly of the first magnitude,” Gopalkrishna Gandhi, 76, former Governor of West Bengal, told The Hindu.  Harsh Mahajan, president, NATHEALTH, a healthcare body which raises issues on access and quality of healthcare, said it was presumed that there was unused stock of between five million and 10 million doses in the private sector in India which would likely start expiring from January to February 2022. Risk assessment Dr. Mahajan added that in case the expert committee of the Government decided that a booster dose was necessary, then this stock could be used for boosters for healthcare and frontline workers and those who were at higher risk despite having received two doses. “The objective should be to minimise wastage of this precious resource,” he told The Hindu previously. However, not everyone is convinced that booster doses are necessary for India. Public health expert and epidemiologist Chandrakant Lahariya said the real risk of approving booster doses in India now would mean that it would divert attention away from the more important goal of ensuring as many Indians were inoculated by the year end. He said all the studies on booster doses so far were specific to mRNA vaccines. Since none of these are being administered in India, it would be prudent to conduct those studies, arrive at a reasonable lower bound of vaccine efficacy beyond which a third dose would be necessary, if at all, and then proceed, Dr. Lahariya said. “At this stage when only 30% of Indians are fully inoculated and half of those above 45 still weren’t vaccinated, it’s unreasonable to demand a third dose for otherwise healthy senior citizens,” he told The Hindu. “All evidence shows the vaccines are extremely effective against severe disease and hospitalisation. Transmission can only be addressed by COVID-appropriate behaviour,” he said. He said that it would not be imprudent of the Government, if it had surplus stock, to divert vaccines to Africa which had vaccinated less than a quarter of its population. “The pandemic can end only when most of the world is fully vaccinated and not a small set of people getting multiple doses,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/omicron-risks-spark-call-for-booster-dose/article37763080.ece
30 November 2021||New Delhi,||Centre ‘terrified’ of debate: Rahul||The manner in which the Narendra Modi Government repealed the three contentious farm laws proves that it has done something “wrong” and is “terrified” of having a discussion, former Congress President Rahul Gandhi said on Monday. Soon after both Houses of Parliament repealed the farm laws without a debate, Mr. Gandhi addressed a press conference in which he reiterated that the Congress had predicted how the Government would have to withdraw the farm laws, and said “the might of three or four large crony capitalists couldn’t withstand the might of the Indian farmers and labourers”. “We wanted to discuss MSP [minimum support price]. We wanted to discuss Lakhimpur Kheri incident. We wanted to discuss the 700 farmers who died in this agitation and unfortunately that discussion has not been allowed...What is truly unfortunate is how the Bills have been repealed, without any discussion, without any conversation. We wanted to have a discussion about forces behind these Bills because these Bills do not just reflect the view of the Prime Minister, these Bills reflect the forces behind the Prime Minister,” Mr. Gandhi said. “This is a reflection of the fact that the Government is terrified of having this discussion. The Government wants to hide. The Government does not have the guts to stand up for its action and this is what is quite unfortunate,” he said. When it was pointed out that the Prime Minister Narendra Modi had apologised in his televised address to the nation on November 19, Mr. Gandhi said, “What’s the point of having Parliament then to make laws? Just shut it down.” Elaborating further, the former Congress chief said that if Mr. Modi had “accepted his mistake”, then the Government would have to pay the compensation to over 700 farmers who died during the year-long protests. Countering the narrative that the farm laws repeal proved the Modi Government’s sincerity towards the farmers, Mr. Gandhi said, “What were they doing for the last one year? Why did it take 700 dead farmers for them to repeal these laws? Why is the Prime Minister apologising? If they have done nothing against the farmers, why is he apologising?” Earlier in the day, before proceedings of Parliament started, Congress president Sonia Gandhi addressed party MPs and led a protest against the farm laws. Addressing the joint Opposition press conference later, Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge told presspersons, “In the past, there have been 17 Bills that were debated on the floor of Parliament before repeal.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-terrified-of-debate-rahul/article37763070.ece
30 November 2021||New Delhi,||MPs’ suspension against RS rules: Opposition||Opposition parties have termed the Government’s decision to suspend 12 Rajya Sabha members for the rest of the winter session over protests during the monsoon session as “unwarranted” and “undemocratic”. In a joint statement14 opposition parties said, “The leaders of the opposition parties unitedly condemn the unwarranted and undemocratic suspension of the 12 members in violation of all the Rules of Procedure of Rajya Sabha pertaining to suspension of members for the entire duration of the winter session.” As Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge held a hurried meeting to frame the opposition reaction to the unprecedented suspension, some parties felt if the government refuses to open a dialogue for revoking the suspension of 12 MPs, the Opposition should consider boycotting the entire session. Others however, had some reservations on boycotting the Parliament. The Trinamool did not participate in the Congress-led deliberations; nor did it sign the Opposition statement. Party MP Dola Sen said it was not informed of the Opposition meeting. The 12 suspended MPs include five from Congress — Phulo Devi Netam, Ripun Bora, Rajamani Patel, Syed Nasir Hussain and Akhilesh Pratap Singh; two from Trinamool Congress — Dola Sen and Shanta Chhetri; two from Shiv Sena — Anil Desai and Priyanka Chaturvedi; CPI(M)’s Elamaram Kareem and CPI’s Binoy Viswam. There is no clarity on why these 12 MPs have been chosen for suspension when the charge-sheet had named more than 20. On August 11, AAP MP Sanjay Singh was one of the first to climb on the reporters’ table. Visuals of Congress MP Pratap Singh Bajwa throwing the rule book at the empty chair were circulated on TV. But neither has been suspended.  (With inputs from   Vijaita Singh)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mps-suspension-against-rs-rules-opposition/article37763075.ece
30 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Adverse events less than 0.01%: Govt.||The Government has told the Supreme Court that COVID-19 vaccination is voluntary and serious or severe effects of inoculation, including death, account for less than 0.01%. “The percentage of such effect having serious/severe [including deaths] in case of both Covaxin and Covishield is less than 0.01%. This again is in the caveat that any such severe/serious effect including death cannot be attributed to vaccination.” The Health Ministry said 2,116 serious and severe AEFI cases have been reported from 1,19,38,44,741 doses administered till November 24. Vaccination is encouraged for one’s own good and in public health, it said. “An individual’s ill health has a direct effect on society,” it submitted in a 58-page affidavit before a Bench led by Justice L. Nageswara Rao on Monday. The very proof that the vaccination is not mandatory is evident from the fact that no benefits or services are attached to it. The Government said it is transparent about vaccination data. Public domain “Post-vaccination adverse data is already in the public domain,” the Ministry said. “A report of rapid review and analysis completed for 495 [463 Covishield and 32 Covaxin] cases has been submitted. Another report of 1,356 cases [1,236 Covishield, 118 Covaxin and two Sputnik] serious and severe AEFI cases [including 495 cases already analysed] has been presented to the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 [EGVAC].The rapid review and analysis of balance cases is under way and will be completed soon,” the Centre told the court. The Centre said any death or hospitalisation following vaccination cannot be automatically assumed to be due to vaccination. “Here, causality assessments help to understand whether the ‘Adverse Event Following Immunisation’ was caused directly due to vaccine, and are conducted at State and national level for the investigated cases.” It said data relating to clinical trial, approval by the DCGI and vaccination data “required to be and can be released as per law is already available in the public domain”. The minutes of meetings and committee deliberations to the extent permissible are already out, it said. Dr. Jacob Puliyel, a former member of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, wants the court to direct the Government, its bodies and the two domestic vaccine manufacturers — Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech — to transparently reveal clinical trial and vaccination data, including the recording and reporting of adverse events.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/adverse-events-less-than-001-govt/article37763090.ece
30 November 2021||Chennai,||States gear up to implement new protocols in airports||States across the country have scurried to implement the testing, tracing and quarantine for international passengers from a few countries where the Omicron variant of the coronavirus has been recorded, on advice from the Union Ministry of Health. Some States have already implemented these procedures, while others will start implementing these restrictions from December 1, and some others are still awaiting instructions from the State government. While Standard Operating Procedures already mandate that an international passenger uploads a negative RT-PCR report along with a self-declaration form (SDF) in the Air Suvidha portal, in the light of a new variant emerging, further steps have been put in place. The list of at-risk countries is available in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare website(www.mohfw.gov.in); passengers coming from these ‘at risk’ countries, have to undergo an RT-PCR test on arrival. If they test negative, they must quarantine themselves at home for seven days, and a repeat test will have to be done on the eighth day. However, the samples of those passengers testing positive will be sent for genomic testing at INSACOG laboratories and they would be admitted in an isolation facility as notified by the State government. This compulsory testing of passengers is only for those countries which have been notified as ‘at risk’, whereas for travellers coming from countries which are not designated ‘at risk’, a random sample for RT-PCR of 5% of travellers is to be carried out on arrival. Sources said, since November 10, nearly 1,000 passengers from South Africa have arrived at the Mumbai International Airport. The BMC’s guidelines state that passengers arriving at the Mumbai airport will have to get their passport scrutinised at the immigration counter for travel history of the last two weeks. The Maharashtra government is likely to make a negative RT-PCR test mandatory for entry of domestic travellers. A senior official of the Chennai Airport said the idea is to work out a system that will not inconvenience international passengers too much. The airport had ceased testing of international passengers two months ago, but will restart from December 15, when full fledged commercial operations were scheduled to resume. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority had decided to conduct 100% RT-PCR testing of passengers from High Risk Countries, followed by genome sequencing of the positive cases & mandatory isolation/quarantine as per the guidelines laid down by the Central Government, according to Raj Niwas sources. Andhra Pradesh Health, Medical and Family Welfare Minister Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas said all international passengers arriving at airports in the State have to undergo Rt-PCR test starting from Tuesday, in tune with the Union government’s guidelines regarding Omicron variant. COVID-19 tests on passengers coming from ‘countries at-risk’ and who land at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA), Shamshabad, Telangana, has begun. However, there are no direct flights from the countries at-risk to the airport yet, officials said. If any of the passengers test positive, they will be isolated at Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS), Gachibowli, Hyderabad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/states-gear-up-to-implement-new-protocols-in-airports/article37763137.ece
30 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||May get kidnapped again, says Choksi||Fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi has claimed that there is a plot to “kidnap” him from Antigua to neighbouring Caribbean State of Guyana. In a video message, Mr. Choksi who is wanted for defrauding banks in India said he was willing to cooperate with the investigation in India over online platforms. “I feel very unsafe. I may be coerced and kidnapped again and taken to Guyana, where there is a strong Indian presence, which may be utilised in an unlawful manner to spirit me away,” said Mr Choksi. He claimed that the charges against him were false and that he would prove his innocence. Mr. Choksi said he was yet to recover from the experience of May-June 2021, when he was allegedly kidnapped by a group of non-resident Indians from Antigua to Dominica. “I am fighting the cases both in Antigua and Dominica, but I am very clear that I will come out victorious in the end,” said Mr Choksi who maintained that he was an Antiguan citizen and that he did not try to immigrate to Dominica illegally in the summer. He said he was open to cooperating with investigating agencies in India through online modalities like Zoom as his health had been deteriorating since the alleged attempted kidnapping. Mr. Choksi and his legal team have been maintaining that an attempt was made to entice him through a female friend who invited him to her residence, where a team of Indian-origin operatives overpowered him and took him to Dominica with the intention of spiriting him away to India to face charges in the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/i-may-be-kidnapped-again-from-antigua-says-choksi/article37762913.ece
30 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Onus of contraception still on women, NFHS-5 figures show||Less than one in 10 men use condoms in India, while nearly four in 10 women undergo sterilisation to avoid pregnancy, according to the latest National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-21), which also shows that female sterilisation continues to be on the rise. Only 9.5% of men used condoms but 37.9% of women underwent sterilisation, according to the NFHS. Though condom use in urban India is better than rural parts, the overall trend is vastly similar — 7.6% men in rural India and 13.6% men in urban India use condoms, while 38.7% women in rural India and 36.3% in urban India underwent sterilisation. Female sterilisation has gone up for the entire country from 36% in NFHS-4 (2015-16) to 37.9% in NFHS-5. In 19 of the 36 States and Union Territories, female sterilisation increased in NFHS-5 from that of NFHS-4. The rise was more than 5 percentage points in 11 States and UTs. The States with the highest increase in female sterilisation were Bihar (14.1% points to 34.8%), Goa (13.6% points to 29.9%) and Madhya Pradesh (9.7% points to 51.9%) . In 23 of the 36 States and UTs for which data were available, condom use was less than 10%. The State with the highest condom use was Uttarakhand (25.6%) and the Union Territory Chandigarh (31.1%). The silver lining, however, is that use of condoms has gone up between the two surveys — from 5.6% to 9.5%. The refusal to use condoms is not due to lack of awareness — NFHS-5 data shows that 82% men were aware that consistent use of condoms can reduce the chance of getting HIV/AIDS. Studies, however, show that promotion of condoms for protection from HIV/AIDS creates confusion in their acceptance among married couples. Many stereotypes “Condom usage is also low because family planning is considered the responsibility of women. For men, sex stands purely for pleasure. For women, it is often either about procreation, or involves the fear of getting pregnant. Men also believe that condoms reduce pleasure,” says Poonam Muttreja, Executive Director, Population Foundation of India. “Male sterilisation’s share in family planning methods has always been extremely low, despite the fact that it’s safer, quicker and easier. People believe that it can affect their virility and weaken them physically, rendering them unfit to work. These are myths and misconceptions that need to be addressed,” she says. Female sterilisation is also the preferred choice of contraception over methods such as pills (5.1%), injectables (0.6%) and intra-uterine devices (IUD) and post-partum intra-uterine devices (2.1%). “Most women tend to think of family planning not for delaying and spacing but for completing the family size, though the trend is changing,” Vinod Manning, CEO, Ipas Development Foundation and CAG member for Pratigya Campaign.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/onus-of-contraception-still-on-women-nfhs-5-figures-show/article37763088.ece
30 November 2021||CHENNAI,||Webinar explores careers in analytics||A webinar on ‘Build a Global Business Analytics Career in the U.S., Canada, and Europe’, presented by Insofe, was held as a part of The Hindu Education Plus Study Abroad series on November 27 and shed light on the options available for careers in Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, machine learning and related fields. “The problem in most industries today is that people who study business don’t understand technology and the people who study technology don’t understand the business,” said Venkatesh Sunkad, Dean, Business Programmes at Insofe. He also spoke about the demand for people who can bridge the gap between Data Science and business. Maud Le Bars, South Asia area manager for Rennes School of Business in France, said France is a great destination for students to pursue courses, as it has over 25 institutions that are among the top 100 in the world for business or management. On the opportunities in Ottawa, Robin Ritchie, Associate Dean of Professional Graduate Programmes and Associate Professor of Marketing at Carleton University, Canada, said the nexus of high technology and the demand for people with expertise in data analytics makes their MBA a collaborative and experiential one. “The students get a chance to work with other students on real-time projects and the built-in internship is part of the programme.” Consumer behavious Suzy Siegel, the Provost, Executive Vice President and Professor of Management, Walsh College, U.S., stressed the importance of Data Science specifically in the American context. Calling it the backbone of business, she pointed out that not only could it help assess consumer behaviour but also help companies assess return on their marketing investment.

30 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||SKM alleges false claims in reasons for law repeal||Farm unions pushed back on the reasons and objects of the farm laws repeal Bill on Monday, refuting the Government’s claims on farmers’ choices, electronic trading, prior consultations and the scope of protests. Union leaders also asked why the repeal Bill was pushed through without any discussion in Parliament of their other demands, including minimum support prices (MSP) for crops and Government procurement. Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, however, said that there was no need for a discussion on the repeal, given that both the ruling and Opposition parties were unanimous in their support for the repeal. He also blamed Opposition parties for preventing a discussion in the Lok Sabha by disrupting proceedings, noting that the Speaker Om Birla repeatedly told Opposition MPs that a discussion could be held if they returned to their seats. The repeal was evidence that the Prime Minister kept his word to farmers, Mr. Tomar said. Freedom already exists “The Statement of Objects and Reasons accompanying the repeal Bill cannot be farther from the truth,” said the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of farm unions, noting that most State APMC Acts already give farmers the freedom to sell their produce to any buyer at any place of their choice. “Such a freedom was not given for the first time by the Modi Government as is being claimed. Further, any so-called freedom without protection from exploitation is meaningless.” With regard to claims that the farm laws created a facilitative framework for electronic trading to improve transparency and price discovery, and created an ecosystem for traders and processors to engage with stakeholders, the All India Kisan Sabha alleged that the laws did not include safeguards to prevent profiteering and monopoly by corporates and private entities in the country. “The million dollar question is, this engagement is for the sake of which stakeholder,” asked AIKS general secretary Hannan Mollah. SKM leaders also slammed the Centre for not admitting that the laws were enacted in an unconstitutional manner, without proper consultations. “In a democracy, opportunistic consultations with industry-sponsored farm unions is not the way forward, and deliberative democratic processes need to be adopted,” the SKM statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/skm-slams-false-claims-in-reasons-for-law-repeal/article37763071.ece
30 November 2021||New Delhi,||Trinamool, BJP MPs spar at meet||The Business Advisory Committee (BAC) meeting of the Lok Sabha on Monday not only saw intense discussion on the question of having a debate along with the Bill to repeal the farm laws but also witnessed some sharp exchanges between Trinamool Congress member Kalyan Banerjee and BJP member Jagdambika Pal. Half an hour before Lok Sabha proceedings for the day began, the BAC — the parliamentary panel that allots time for discussing various Bills — met at Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla’s office. While the BAC reached a consensus to allocate time for discussion on the ordinances that allow the Government to extend the tenures of the Enforcement Directorate chief and the CBI Director, sources told The Hindu that the Opposition was divided over the Bill to repeal to three farm laws. While the Congress’s Kodikunnil Suresh, the DMK’s T.R. Baalu and Mr. Banerjee of the Trinamool were firm on having a debate before the farm laws were passed, the YSR Congress Party, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi and the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) did not insist on a debate after Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi told the BAC members that there was “no precedent” of having a debate while repealing a law. BJD leader Pinaki Misra is said to have argued that farmers were looking towards Parliament for a solution and if the Government wanted to repeal without a debate, they should be allowed to do so. A structured debate on agrarian issues can take place later, Mr. Misra is learnt to have said. Mr. Pal, the BJP MP from Uttar Pradesh, then spoke and lauded the Prime Minister for his decision to roll back the farm laws. At this point, when the Trinamool MP passed a remark against Mr. Pal, the atmosphere got very tense as the BJP took strong objection. The sharp exchange between the two prompted other MPs to intervene and pacify the agitated members. Expressing his displeasure over such behaviour, Mr. Birla ended the meeting. After the Lok Sabha passed the Bill without a discussion, Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, along with Mr. Baalu and Mr. Suresh again, met the Speaker and registered their protest for not allowing the Opposition to speak as the Bill was passed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/trinamool-bjp-mps-spar-at-meet/article37763073.ece
30 November 2021||New Delhi,||Per capita out-of-pocket health expenditure sees decline: report||Out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) as a share of total health expenditure and foreign aid for health has both come down as per the findings of the National Health Accounts (NHA) estimates for India for 2017-18 released on Monday by Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan. As a share of total health expenditure, the OOPE has come down to 48.8% in 2017-18 from 64.2% in 2013-14. Even in the case of per capita OOPE, there has been a decline from Rs. 2,336 to Rs. 2,097 between 2013-14 and 2017-18. “One of the factors attributing to this decline is the increase in utilisation and reduction in cost of services in Government health facilities. If we compare NHA 2014-15 and 2017-18, there has been a decline in OOPE for Government hospitals to the tune of 50%,” said Mr. Bhushan. This is the fifth consecutive NHA report produced by National Health Systems Resource Centre, designated as National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat in 2014 by the Health Ministry. The NHA estimates are prepared by using an accounting framework based on internationally accepted System of Health Accounts 2011, provided by the World Health Organization. Govt. support Mr. Bhushan, releasing the report, said that the NHA estimates for 2017-18 clearly showed that there had been an increase in the share of Government health expenditure in the total GDP of the country. “It has increased from 1.15% in 2013-14 to 1.35% in 2017-18. Additionally, the share of Government Health Expenditure in total health expenditure has also increased over time. In 2017-18, the share of Government expenditure was 40.8%, which is much higher than 28.6% in 2013-14,” he said. The report further indicates that in per capita terms, the Government health expenditure has increased from Rs. 1,042 to Rs. 1,753 between 2013-14 to 2017-18. Also the share of social security expenditure on health, which includes the social health insurance programme, Government financed health insurance schemes, and medical reimbursements made to Government employees, has increased.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/per-capita-out-of-pocket-health-expenditure-sees-decline-report/article37763086.ece
30 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Why so few claims for COVID-19 ex gratia, asks Supreme Court||The Supreme Court wondered on Monday why only a few of those who lost their loved ones to COVID-19 have come so far to claim the Rs. 50,000 ex gratia compensation. A Bench led by Justice M.R. Shah asked the Chief Secretaries of States to furnish the Centre with answers to a series of eight questions raised by the court. They include the number of deaths recorded in each State, the number of claims received by them individually, the compensation paid so far, and whether grievance redressal committee in each district had been constituted. The court also asked the States if online portals for disbursal of compensation have been created or not. Revised system It approved the revised and simplified model of disbursement of compensation adopted by the Gujarat government and said the same model could be applied across the country During the hearing, the court noted that some of the States had not furnished any particulars to the Centre regarding the disbursement of the ex gratia. Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Assam, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Tripura, UTs of Chandigarh, J&K and Ladakh had not provided information to the Union government, “though specifically asked by Union of India pursuant to our order”, the Supreme Court said. The court had also sought information on the headway made so far by States in constituting grievance redressal committees to hear complaints made by families regarding payment of the compensation. On November 22, the Supreme Court had ordered the Centre to “gather information” from States on the progress made in the disbursement of ex gratia compensation to the kin of patients who died of COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/why-only-a-few-claims-for-covid-19-ex-gratia-asks-sc/article37763091.ece
30 November 2021||November 30 2021 00:00 IST,||States gear up for new airport protocols||This compulsory testing of passengers is only for those countries which have been notified as ‘at risk’, whereas for travellers coming from countries which are not designated ‘at risk’, a random sample for RT-PCR of 5% of travellers is to be carried out on arrival. Sources said, since November 10, nearly 1,000 passengers from South Africa have arrived at the Mumbai International Airport. The BMC’s guidelines state that passengers arriving at the Mumbai airport will have to get their passport scrutinised at the immigration counter for travel history of the last two weeks. The Maharashtra government is likely to make a negative RT-PCR test mandatory for entry of domestic travellers. A senior official of the Chennai Airport said the idea is to work out a system that will not inconvenience international passengers too much. The airport had ceased testing of international passengers two months ago, but will restart from December 15, when full fledged commercial operations were scheduled to resume. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority had decided to conduct 100% RT-PCR testing of passengers from High Risk Countries, followed by genome sequencing of the positive cases & mandatory isolation/quarantine as per the guidelines laid down by the Central Government, according to Raj Niwas sources. Andhra Pradesh Health, Medical and Family Welfare Minister Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas said all international passengers arriving at airports in the State have to undergo RT-PCR test starting from Tuesday, in tune with the Union Government’s guidelines. COVID-19 tests on passengers coming from ‘countries at-risk’ and who land at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA), Shamshabad, Telangana, has begun. However, there are no direct flights from the countries at-risk to the airport yet, officials said. If any of the passengers test positive, they will be isolated at Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS), Gachibowli, Hyderabad.

30 November 2021||KOLKATA,||Trinamool to tweak its party constitution||The Trinamool Congress on Monday announced its decision to change its constitution so that it can induct more members in its committees from other States. The decision was taken at a meeting attended by party chairperson Mamata Banerjee and leaders like Yashwant Sinha, Pawan Verma and Mukul Sangma. The working committee empowered Ms. Banerjee to make the necessary changes to the party’s structure. “In the present political situation, only the Trinamool Congress can take on the Bharatiya Janata Party. Under the leadership of Mamata Banerjee, we are ready for the battle. After the meeting today, Trinamool Congress will emerge in a new pan-India avatar,” said Pawan Verma who joined the party recently. Trinamool MP and national spokesperson Derek O’Brien said these changes did not mean that there would be a change in the DNA of the party. “To defeat the BJP, Mamata di is the strongest, most credible and the most experienced leader. This is because she is not only a three-time Chief Minister, but also a seven-term MP,” he said. Sangma felicitated Earlier in the day, Ms. Banerjee felicitated former Meghalaya Chief Minister Mukul Sangma and other Congress leaders who joined the Trinamool recently. The party’s national general secretary and MP Abhishek Banerjee was also present at the working committee meeting held at the residence of the Chief Minister. Along with Ms. Banerjee, several leaders, including Mr. Sinha and Mr. Verma, spoke at the meeting. Other issues like whether the Trinamool should join the Congress in protesting against the policies of the Union Government were discussed. The leadership appreciated the party’s work in Tripura.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/trinamool-to-tweak-its-party-constitution/article37762918.ece

Omicron was first reported on November 24 from South Africa. It has since spread to more than a dozen countries, many of which have imposed travel restrictions to try to seal themselves off. Japan on Monday joined Israel in saying it would close its borders to foreigners. “The impact on vulnerable populations would be substantial, particularly in countries with low vaccination coverage,” the WHO stated. In vaccinated persons, meanwhile, “COVID-19 cases and infections are expected ... albeit in a small and predictable proportion”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/omicron-poses-very-high-global-risk-says-who/article37763132.ece
30 November 2021||November 30 2021 00:00 IST,||Parliament clears Farm Laws Repeal Bill||“I will allow the discussion only when the House is in order,” he repeatedly said and asked Mr. Tomar to proceed first with introducing and then taking up the Bill for consideration and passing. Leader of the Congress Legislature Party in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Choudhary intervened stating that in the past, six Acts had been repealed since 2014, and discussion had been allowed for the same and that this Bill too should come up for debate. “The word here is consideration and passing, and we ask that the bill be taken up for consideration by the House before passing,” he said. Speaker Om Birla, however, said no discussion could take place with parliamentarians crowding the Well of the House. “This is not the way one can debate bills,” he said. The Bill was then passed by voice vote and the House adjourned till 2 p.m. In Rajya Sabha, after two adjournments in the first half of the day, the House met at 2 p.m. to repeal the laws. The opposition parties again protested as the Government moved the bill, without offering a debate on the issue. Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge was given a brief opportunity to speak on the issue. Mr Kharge said everyone in the house welcomed the repeal of the bills and congratulated the Government for the belated wisdom on withdrawing the bills. But the minute he started talking about the deaths 750 farmers in the year long agitation, Deputy Chairman Harivansh who was in chair, told him that his time was up. Lakhimpur Kheri case “The farmers still continue to sit in protest. Many of their demands still remain unmet. We also need to debate the events of Lakhimpur Kheri,” Mr. Kharge said. As the Bill was passed without debate, opposition MPs rose in protest. TMC MPs Nadimul Haque and Dola Sen walked into the well of the house. As soon as Ms. Sen approached the chair, Parliament security officials trooped in. Speaking outside Parliament, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said, “The manner in which the Government passed the Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021 proves that the Government was wrong and was scared of a discussion.” Senior Congress leaders pointed out that at least 17 acts repealed by the current Government from 2014 onwards had been repealed after due discussion, and this exception of no debate therefore indicated the Government's pusillanimity in discussing issues related to farmers in the Houses of Parliament. Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Pralhad Joshi, however, said that since Prime Minister Modi had already stated that the Bills were being repealed acknowledging the wishes of a certain section of farmers and the opposition, there was little need for debate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/parliament-clears-farm-laws-repeal-bill/article37762907.ece
30 November 2021||November 30 2021 00:00 IST,||We don’t track crypto trading, says Govt.||Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das has been raising serious concerns about cryptocurrency in the context of macroeconomic and financial stability and has called for more ‘well-informed’ public discussions to understand the ‘far deeper issues’ involved. The government has plans to introduce a Bill to regulate cryptocurrency. It might possibly ban all private cryptocurrencies and facilitate the creation of the official digital currency, in the ongoing winter session of Parliament. Last month, the RBI, which is eyeing a pilot project for a central bank digital currency (CBDC), urged the Government to amend the RBI Act of 1934, Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary said in response to a query. The law will need to be changed to enhance the scope of the definition of a ‘bank note’ so as to include digital currency. “RBI has been examining use cases and working out a phased implementation strategy for introduction of CBDC with little or no disruption,” the Minister said, adding that an official digital currency can potentially provide significant benefits, such as reduced dependency on cash, higher seigniorage due to lower transaction costs and reduced settlement risk. “Introduction of CBDC would also possibly lead to a more robust, efficient, trusted, regulated and legal tender-based payments option. There are also associated risks which need to be carefully evaluated,” he noted. As per the available purport of The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021, the Government may ban all private cryptocurrencies in India, while allowing for ‘certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses’. Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently held a meeting with top officials from the central bank and the Ministries of Home Affairs and Finance on cryptocurrencies and expressed concerns about attempts to mislead the youth through over-promising and non-transparent advertising. On the Bitcoin hacking scam in Karnataka, the Finance Ministry said a case has been registered by the Bangalore zonal unit of the Enforcement Directorate. It added that any further disclosure of information in the matter is ‘not in larger public interest’ and put the onus on the State for investigating the criminal aspects of the case. “Information in public domain suggests that a case of cybercrime involving Bitcoin has been under examination by the Karnataka police. ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order are State subjects as per the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India,” Mr. Chaudhary said in reply to an unstarred question on the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/we-dont-track-crypto-trading-says-ministry/article37763065.ece

One of the 63 Nayanmars was Thirukkurippu Thonda Nayanar. He derived great happiness from washing the clothes of Lord Siva’s devotees. One day, a devotee of Lord Siva appeared before him. The devotee wanted his clothes to be washed and dried the same day. Thirukkurippu Thondar agreed gladly. But, it rained heavily, and the devotee’s clothes could not be dried before that evening. Dejected at not being able to keep his word to the devotee, Thirukkurippu Thondar decided to give up his life. He was about to dash his head against a rock, when Lord Siva appeared before him and told him that the devotee had been none other than He. The Nayanar attained liberation. In Pazhaiyanur, near Thiruvalankadu, lived 70 agriculturists known for their honesty. A merchant wanted to marry a woman he had fallen in love with. So he killed his wife, and married a second time. One day, as he was passing through the forest near Pazhaiyanur, his wife appeared before him. She asked him to take her home, but the merchant refused. The agriculturists of Pazhaiyanur asked the man to take her home. He said it was not his wife, but a ghost. They said he could spend the night in a rest house in their village and leave for his village the next day. If some harm came to him, they said they would all give up their lives. That night the merchant’s wife, who had come as a ghost, killed him. Because they could not protect the merchant as they had promised, the agriculturists ended their lives. This story is recorded in Gnanasambandar’s Thevaram verses relating to Thiruvalankadu and also in Umapathy Sivachariar’s Thiruthondar Purana Varalaru.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/keeping-ones-word/article37763078.ece

It fielded nine candidates in Malda, Murshidabad and Uttar Dinajpur with a significant minority population in the Assembly polls earlier this year. However, none of them could win. The Trinamool fielded 23 minority candidates in the KMC poll to be held on December 19. BJP spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya refused to entertain any question on the number of minority candidates. “The BJP does not indulge in the politics which differentiates minorities,” he said. Political observers feel that the BJP’s move is an acceptance that the party cannot contest in West Bengal without taking into consideration the 27% minority electorate. The BJP nominated 50 women and, unlike the Assembly polls, has been conservative by nominating booth-level workers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-fields-candidates-for-kolkata-polls/article37763066.ece

A Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar was assured by Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta, for the Centre, that no “precipitative action” would be taken against Mr. Bandyopadhyay before the court pronounces its judgment. Mr. Bandyopadhyay came into the limelight when he did not attend a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Kolkata in the wake of Cyclone Yaas. He was issued a show-cause notice under the Disaster Management Act. Mr. Bandyopadhyay resigned from service but was subject to disciplinary proceedings initiated by the Centre. He had approached the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) in Kolkata against these proceedings, following which, the CAT’s Principal Bench in Delhi transferred the case to the Capital. Stinging remarks The Calcutta High Court had intervened to set aside the transfer of the case, but not before making stinging remarks like the modus operandi of the Union Government “reeks of mala fides” and the CAT Principal Bench was “overzealous” to cater to the fiat of the Government and paid “obeisance to the diktat of the Union of India”. The Centre had appealed to the apex court, challenging the jurisdiction of the Calcutta HC to entertain his case when it was already transferred to Delhi. Moreover, the Union had taken strong objection to the remarks made in the Calcutta High Court order against it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/alapan-case-sc-reserves-verdict-on-centres-plea/article37762906.ece

A Division Bench of justices SJ Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav recalled the order passed by Justice Madhav Jamdar. This was done after Sameer Wankhede’s father Dhyandev and Mr. Malik consented that the order be recalled.

The court allowed Mr. Malik to file a fresh affidavit in the interim application in the defamatory suit filed by Mr. Wankhede by December 9. Mr. Wankhede will then file a rejoinder by January 3 and the matter will be heard by the same Bench of justice Madhav Jamdar and completed in 13 weeks, the court directed. The court directed that Mr. Malik will not make any public statements or use social media against the Wankhedes. Last week, the Bench had said Mr. Malik’s tweets against Mr. Wankhede did seem to be a clear case of malice and logically he should be restrained from making such comments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/court-restrains-malik-from-public-remarks/article37763064.ece

30 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Positive samples of foreign travellers to be tested for Omicron||The samples collected from all foreign travellers who test positive for COVID-19 shall be subjected to genomic sequencing, the Directorate of Public Health has said. The tests will be done at 12 designated government RT-PCR laboratories that are equipped with the World Health Organisation-recommended Thermo TaqPath RT-PCR testing kits to identify the new variant, Omicron, designated as B.1.1.529. According to the Directorate’s notice issued on Monday, most diagnostic tests could detect the variant. The variant exhibits a deletion of certain spike protein positions, similar to the Alpha variant. The laboratories have been instructed to prioritise such specimens for sequencing to confirm the presence of Omicron. A proxy test for the variant, known as Thermo Fischer TaqPath Assay, could be used, pending genome sequencing confirmation, the notice said. The government laboratories identified for the assay include the State Public Health laboratory; the King Institute of Preventive Medicine; Madras Medical College; Kilpauk and Stanley Medical Colleges in Chennai; Coimbatore Medical College; and ESI Medical College, Coimbatore; and the Government Medical Colleges in Tiruchi, Salem, Madurai, Thoothukudi and Kanniyakumari. Eight categories of samples have been identified for testing. The samples of the following segments should be subjected to genome-sequencing, if they have tested positive for COVID-19. They are international travellers since October 15; reinfected persons; those infected after vaccination; those who are part of community clusters or an unusual transmission event; those who are part of family clusters; children testing positive; and young adults with severe lung involvement or an unexpected disease or severe illness. Under the new guidelines, all positive samples referred from government and private RT-PCR laboratories should be sent to the State Public Health Laboratory in the city for genomic sequencing. The Deputy Director of Health Services in the districts should coordinate the process through their epidemiologists and microbiologists. The protocol should be followed for all inbound international travellers with symptoms of influenza-like illness. The samples will be screened for S gene dropout using the Thermo TaqPath kit by the government RT-PCR laboratories, Director of Public Health T.S. Selvavinayagam has said. The Health Department will appoint assistant project officers at the four international airports in the State to oversee the sample collection, Health Minister Ma. Subramanian has said. “On Wednesday, senior health officials will accompany me to Madurai where we will inspect the airport. Later, we will travel to Tiruchi and Coimbatore. We will also apprise the officials of the procedures to be followed on arrival of passengers. Along with Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan, I will be supervising how the instructions are carried out,” the Minister said, after inspecting the genome sequencing unit on the Directorate of Medical Services premises here on Monday. According to him, 95% of the COVID-19 samples tested at the sequencing unit had returned positive for the Delta variant. At a review meeting, Chief Secretary V. Irai Anbu asked officials to follow the WHO guidelines for tackling the new variant and directed the Collectors to drive home the point among people that vaccination was the only defence against the severity of the disease.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/positive-samples-of-foreign-travellers-to-be-tested-for-omicron/article37763236.ece

30 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||CM hands over Rs. 129.59 cr. subsidy to small temples||Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Monday increased the fixed deposits for 12,959 one-time puja ( oru kaala pujai ) temples in the State to Rs. 2 lakh each. He released Rs. 129.59 crore as State subsidy towards this. One-time puja temples under the purview of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR and CE) Department have so far been getting interest from fixed deposit of Rs. 1 lakh each to be used for puja. Mr. Stalin handed over a cheque for Rs. 129.59 crore to Tamil Nadu Power Finance and Infrastructure Development Corporation (Tufidco - Powerfin) as fixed deposit. The Corporation’s Chairman and Managing Director Atulya Misra received the cheque at a function at the Secretariat. It was in 1984 that a scheme to provide funds to temples was launched. In 1993, it was increased to Rs. 25,000 per temple from Rs. 3,500 and in the first phase 2,500 temples were covered. The government created fixed deposits of Rs. 1 lakh each for 12,959 temples from surplus funds of large temples in 2011. In September 2021, the government began providing Rs. 1,000 a month per priest of the one-time puja temples. Minister for HR and CE P.K. Sekarbabu said this was a big step towards providing enough funds for performing pujas in these temples, which were surviving on a shoe-string budget. He said that earlier this year, the Chief Minister had arranged for providing provisions, including rice, from his personal funds to COVID-19 affected priests of such temples. Secretary B. Chandra Mohan and Commissioner J. Kumaragurubaran were present. Priests from various one-time puja temples, who were invited to the event, expressed their gratitude.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cm-hands-over-rs-12959-cr-subsidy-to-small-temples/article37763245.ece

30 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Allot land for tomato traders: HC||The Madras High Court on Monday directed Koyambedu Wholesale Market Managing Committee to allot one out of a three-acre vacant land for exclusive use of licensed tomato traders. It said such an exercise could be undertaken on an experimental basis for four weeks to find out if it helped in bringing down the price of tomatoes in open market. Justice R. Suresh Kumar passed the interim order on a writ petition filed by Thanthai Periyar Tomato Traders Association which sought direction to the managing committee to permit the tomato traders to use an 84-cent open ground, available in front of N-124 godown inside the market complex, for loading and unloading tomatoes. The association said the price of tomatoes had risen to over Rs. 140 a kg a few days ago and that it could be brought under control if the traders were allowed to use the open ground for parking trucks that brought tomatoes from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka. However, the managing committee told the court that the use of the open ground had nothing to do with the price of tomatoes. The prices had increased solely because of difficulties in procurement and transportation due to incessant rain in the last few days. Daily arrivals Stating that the prices had begun to cool down and that tomatoes were available now for Rs. 40 a kg, the committee said that 75 to 105 truck loads of tomatoes arrived at the Koyambedu wholesale market every day and there was enough space to accommodate all of them. During heavy rain, the number of truckloads had reduced to around 40. The committee said the procurement price of Grade I tomatoes had gone up to Rs. 96.43 kg in the Koyambedu market on November 24 and they were sold for Rs. 100 a kg on that day. However, the same Grade I tomatoes were procured for Rs. 39.29 and sold for Rs. 42.86 on November 27. Further stating that the open ground referred to by the tomato traders was only 24 cents and not 84 cents as claimed by them, M. Velmurugan, counsel for the committee, said the market complex otherwise had enough space to park around 800 trucks. He referred to availability of around three acres near Gate number 14.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/allot-land-for-tomato-traders-hc/article37763262.ece

Chandra Mohan, Principal Secretary, State Tourism Department, on Monday said while the current travel restrictions imposed in the wake of the Omicron variant of SARS CoV-2 will be a dampener for tourism, steps can be taken to enhance tourism between Tamil Nadu and Czech Republic once normalcy returns. Speaking at the webinar on “Growing Opportunities in Tamil Nadu: Czech Tourism,” he said Tamil Nadu could be a major attraction for heritage, adventure, medical and wellness tourism for the Czechs. Roman Masarik, Acting Ambassador of the Czech Republic to India, said the current situation was challenging with India imposing new travel norms and restrictions. However, he hoped things would improve going forward. Mr. Masarik said a number of Czech businessmen were looking for opportunities across India, including Tamil Nadu. Several students from India, including Tamil Nadu, were studying in Czech universities under various scholarship schemes. Big sectors Ar Rm Arun, Honorary Consul of the Czech Republic in Chennai, said education and tourism were the big sectors for collaboration between Tamil Nadu and Czech Republic. Mr. Marek Kroutil, International Marketing Manager, Czech Tourism, participated. Presentations on tourism opportunities were made from both sides.

30 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||GI tag sought for Marthandam honey||Marthandam Beekeepers’ Co-operative Society Ltd. in Kanniyakumari district has filed an application seeking geographical indication (GI) tag for Marthandam honey. P. Sanjai Gandhi, IP Attorney and Advocate, Nodal Officer, Geographical Indication Registration of Products, Government of Tamil Nadu, filed the application on behalf of the society and Tamil Nadu Khadi and Village Industries Board (a State government undertaking) was the facilitator for this. This particular honey is produced in Kakulam and Vilavancode taluks in Kanniyakumari. Data provided in the GI application shows that Marthandam and its neighbouring villages produce around 6 lakh kg of honey each year (from hives kept in Kanniyakumari). Historical records collated by Mr. Gandhi shows that bee-keeping in Marthandam was started at the YMCA, Marthandam campus, by Dr. Spencer Hatch, in 1924. The society was established in the year 1937. “The honey produced in Marthandam has been certified as AGMARK ‘A’ grade by the Government of India,” Mr. Gandhi said. The method of processing this specific honey is unique as it is extracted from the hives and stored in wax coated drums for over 4-9 months which helps in changing the density of the honey as well as removing all the dirt and impurities naturally, he said. The honey is then filtered and packed in glass jars to preserve its quality. According to details furnished by the society, this honey is different also because the bees procure nectar from the wild flowers from the forest area nearby and from the rubber estates.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/gi-tag-sought-for-marthandam-honey/article37763257.ece

Stalin has said he will work harder to ensure that Tamil Nadu is the top ranking State and all sections of society and industry grow together. On Monday, Mr. Stalin thanked India Today magazine for selecting Tamil Nadu as the Best Performing State Overall in the India Today survey of State of States-2021. The Chief Minister said he was dedicating the award to the people of Tamil Nadu and vowed to work harder than in the past seven months of his rule. “When we came to power, we had the problems of COVID-19 and the financial burden of Rs. 5 lakh crore in debts. Due to the government’s efforts and the sacrifices of people, we put a stop to the pandemic,” he said. “For 10 years, all sectors in the State were in the doldrums. Reviving them is not a short-term effort. If we work hard, I am confident Tamil Nadu will regain its lost glory. We are working towards that,” he said. Separately, in a tweet, Mr. Stalin condemned the suspension of 12 Opposition members from the Rajya Sabha on the very first day of the winter session. “Such acts diminish the democratic spirit of Parliament...” He wanted the suspension revoked immediately.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/will-work-harder-to-keep-tn-at-the-top/article37763234.ece
30 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||After 11 years, Cauvery witnesses record flow during NE monsoon||After a gap of 11 years, bountiful flow is being witnessed in the Cauvery river in a sustained manner during the Northeast monsoon (October-December). As on date, the realisation of the Cauvery water, as measured at Biligundlu, was 118.62 thousand million cubic feet (tmc ft) since October 1. It was during the 2010 monsoon that the realisation crossed the three-digit figure, which was 107 tmc ft. A perusal of the data of flow measured at Biligundlu, located on the Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border, since 1974-75 reveals that the cumulative realisation during the monsoon has exceeded the three-digit figure on 10 occasions including the current year. [The year 1974-75 has been taken into account as it was in 1974 that the 1924 inter-State agreement on the sharing of the Cauvery river water came for review]. Till now, the highest quantity during the three-month-period was 167 tmc ft in 2005 followed by 152 tmc ft in 2000 and 137 tmc ft in 1977. The current month’s realisation of the Cauvery water by Tamil Nadu — 70.34 tmc ft — has become the highest quantum for November in the last 47 years. The previous best was 61.18 tmc ft in 2010. Last month, the State received 48.28 tmc ft. As on Monday (November 29), the total realisation for the current year (since June 1) stood at 210.08 tmc ft, an excess of 53.4 tmc ft for the elapsed period of the year. The Mettur reservoir, about 70 km downstream of Biligundlu, remained at the full level of 120 ft with the storage being 93.47 tmc ft. About 22,830 cubic feet per second (cusecs) was being discharged through the river while the inflow was 21,725 cusecs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/after-11-years-cauvery-witnesses-record-flow-during-ne-monsoon/article37763268.ece
30 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Reimburse only 75% of fees to schools for RTE admissions’||The Tamil Nadu Government has directed the Director of Matriculation Schools to reimburse only 75% of fees for the 2020-2021 academic year to schools which have admitted children under the RTE Act. A Government Order issued to this effect by School Education Secretary Kakarla Usha said that the government had sanctioned Rs. 419.52 crore for the 2020-21 academic year towards the reimbursement of fees for non-minority, self-financing schools which have admitted children under the RTE Act. The Right To Education Act states that 25% of seats at the entry level should be kept for the admission of children belonging to disadvantaged groups and weaker sections. Through the 2020-21 academic year, schools had remained shut except for a few months in early 2021 when schools were reopened for senior classes. In a letter to the Director of Matriculation Schools, the Deputy Accountant General referenced a 2020 order of the Madras High Court which observed that due to a complete lockdown during 2020-21, the management of private schools must have saved overheads and recurring cost on various items like electricity, maintenance, water and stationary. The Court had then directed private schools to collect only 75% of the annual school fees fixed for the 2020-21 academic year from the students. “Since the students admitted under the RTE Act also experienced the same situation due to closure of schools during 2020-21, it would be logical to apply the above order of the Hon'ble High Court and reimburse 75% of the annual school fees in respect of the RTE Act students to the private schools concerned for the academic year 2020-2021,” the Deputy Accountant General had said, in his letter. "However, it was noticed during an audit of the office of the District Educational Officer (DEO), Sendurai, Ariyalur district that the DEO has recommended for a full reimbursement of annual school fees to private schools for the RTE Act students for the academic year 2020-2021 without restricting the fees to 75% in line with the order of the High Court. The action of the DEO was objected to and an Audit Para has been included in the Inspection Report,” the letter said. A request was subsequently placed to the Director of Matriculation Schools to send a proposal to the State Government asking for a G.O. to be issued on the 75% reimbursement of RTE fees, to save a huge amount of government money. The DMS had then submitted a proposal to the State Government following which the G.O. for the same has been issued.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/reimburse-only-75-of-fees-to-schools-for-rte-admissions/article37763266.ece

Sixteen acres of land, which includes five acres each of buffer stock godowns at Pandikavanur and Chinnambedu, had been allotted in these villages for this purpose, said Collector Alby John Varghese, who flagged off trucks carrying paddy to hulling centres from the CAP storage facility at Gurupuram in Uthukottai taluk. “The facility at Gurupuram is the first of its kind in the district and has come up on five acres of land where the paddy bags would be stored at a height of two feet and covered with a large cap made of tarpaulin material, which is specifically made for this purpose. Ramachery too will get a similar CAP facility and the paddy thus kept can be stored for up to a year,” Mr. Varghese said. A total of 37,217 tonnes of paddy from the Swarnavari season, which is from August to October, procured through 54 direct procurement centres from 5,041 farmers who had planted paddy on 25,000 hectares of land had been stored in these CAPs and four other agricultural regulated market godowns. Each cap can store around 125 tonnes of paddy at a time. This year, the district procured 15,000 tonnes of paddy more than last year. A farmer said he preferred to supply paddy to government’s procurement centre since he was getting Rs. 2,060 per 100 kg in place of Rs. 950 if sold to private vendors. “The varieties that are usually sown during Swarnavari include the superfine MTV 1010 and CO 51 and ADT 37,” said Jayaraman, a farmer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/paddy-storage-to-be-augmented-in-tiruvallur/article37763258.ece

Stalin urged Union Textiles Minister Piyush Goyal on Monday to direct the Ministries concerned to remove the 11% import duty on cotton. He pitched for reducing the minimum lot at e-auction. In a letter, he also sought the extension of 5% interest subvention to spinning mills for cotton procurement during the peak season (December-March). Mr. Stalin said he had received a representation from the apparel manufacturers on cotton and yarn price volatility and its impact on the prices of fabrics and garments. Tamil Nadu accounted for one-third of India’s textile business, and the trade was the second largest employment-provider in the State. “The present crisis has led to mass cancellation of export orders and hardships in the fulfilment of long-term export commitments. If this situation is not reined in, a large number of apparel and home textile units may soon become unviable, resulting in closure and consequent large-scale unemployment and industrial unrest,” he said. One of the major reasons for the price volatility was the 5% basic customs duty, 5% agriculture infrastructure development cess and 10% social welfare cess imposed in the Union Budget for 2021-22.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/drop-duty-on-cotton-imports-cm/article37763227.ece

John AC Thanakumar, Chairman & MD, Consultant, Minimal Access Surgery, Gastrointestinal & Bariatric Surgery, Anurag Hospital, Coimbatore, said, “50% of the work is done by the doctor, but the other 50% has to be done by the patient. They need to maintain and follow a lifestyle.” P. Balaji Viswanath, Consultant, Laparoscopic & Gastrointestinal Surgeon at Naruvi Hospitals, Vellore, said, “There is a small role for a select group of patients to whom we can say bariatric surgery will cure diabetes. It involves not only the surgery but also post-operative care and follow-up.” The general waiting time for the surgery is from 15 days to 3 months as some need to undergo lifestyle modifications.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/surgery-success-depends-on-doctor-patient/article37763228.ece
30 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||DMDK firm on contesting alone in urban elections||Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK) founder Vijayakant on Monday said the party will contest alone in the soon-to-be-announced urban local body polls in the State. After being decimated in the Assembly election, which the party had fought by holding an alliance with T.T.V. Dhinakaran’s Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) in 60 seats and reduced to less than 1% vote share, the DMDK decided to contest the recent urban local body elections alone. Applications invited Mr. Vijayakant has invited applications for the urban local body elections from the office-bearers and members of the party between December 1 and December 7. Party sources said the decision is in line with the “wishes of the party cadres” who have been reportedly vocal about the party losing out its base to established parties in alliance. “We lose more than we gain. The decision has been taken because our cadres have been consistently telling our party leadership not to form an alliance. We have seen enough,” a senior party leader said. The party’s de-facto face and treasurer, Premalatha Vijayakant, could only come third in Virudhachalam constituency in the last Assembly election. In the consolidated local body results announced, DMDK won just 1 out of 1,421 panchayat union ward member seats and drew a blank in district panchayats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmdk-firm-on-going-it-alone/article37763261.ece

30 November 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Funds crunch slows down bus stand work||The shortage of fund has again slowed down the construction of the integrated bus stand in Vellalore. Earlier this year the civic body had to slow down and then suspend the construction after workers left due to the COVID-19 pandemic, delayed payment to contractor-company that had taken up construction and found itself in a legal tangle regarding land ownership. Now, the construction had resumed but was slow, the Corporation sources said and adduced the reason to delay in getting approval from the Directorate of Town and Country Planning, Chennai, and securing funds. When the Corporation had moved the Directorate for approval for bus stand construction the latter had suggested a few changes. The Corporation was carrying out those suggestions to obtain the approval, the sources said. The other area that the Corporation was working on to resume the construction in full swing was secure funds. Of the Rs. 168 crore estimated for the project, the Corporation’s share was 50%. It was supposed to get the rest in loan. The Corporation’s earlier plan was to approach the HUDCO for loan. But it could not convince the funding organisation for loan and therefore had decided to approach other agencies. At present, it was in talks with State Bank of India and TUFIDCO for loan and hoped to get it within a month. As it stands, the Corporation had spent nearly Rs. 40 crore on the project, the sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/funds-crunch-slows-down-bus-stand-work/article37763286.ece

30 November 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Committed to take preventive measures: Southern Railway||Southern Railway said that it is committed to take preventive measures in coordination with the Forest Departments of Tamil Nadu and Kerala to prevent cases of elephants getting hit by trains in future. In a statement issued on Monday following the incident of three elephants being knocked down by a train near Madukkarai on November 26, Southern Railway said that it is taking measures to implement recommendations made by a committee constituted by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to contain the mortality of elephants on railway tracks. The permanent speed restrictions of 45 kmph during night hours and 65 kmph during day time will continue, the statement said. Between April and September this year, 24 incidents of elephants being sighted near the track have been reported, according to the statement. During the financial years of 2020-21, 2019-20 and 2018-19, the number of reported elephant sightings near the railway tracks was 69, 61 and 24 incidents respectively. The three elephants – a pregnant female, a makna male and a female calf – were knocked down by Train No. 12602 Mangalore Central – Dr. MGR Chennai Central Superfast Express between Walayar and Ettimadai within Palakkad Railway Division. With the railway line between Palakkad and Podanur being a twin single line comprising A line and B line, Southern Railway noted that both the lines can be used for operating trains from either direction. However, operation of goods train on the A line is difficult due to the rising gradient towards Podanur. “In adherence to this operational practice, a goods train was run on B line at the time of the incident and hence, Train no. 12602 had to be run on A line,” the statement said. Preventive measures such as regular clearing of vegetation along the railway tracks, installing solar fencing at ground level with electric voltage of 12 V near the tracks to deter elephants, constructing elephant ramps and installing solar lights have been implemented by the Palakkad Division to prevent such incidents, Southern Railway stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/committed-to-take-preventive-measures-southern-railway/article37763291.ece

Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Chief Wildlife Warden Shekhar Kumar Niraj instructed T.K. Ashok Kumar, District Forest Officer of Coimbatore Forest Division, to initiate work on setting up watch towers at the earliest after identifying a suitable location to monitor elephant movement. Mr. Niraj on Monday visited the railway lines that connect Kanjikode in Kerala and Ettimadai in Tamil Nadu, near Walayar where a Chennai-bound train knocked down three elephants, including a pregnant one, on Friday night. He also instructed the DFO to initiate foot patrols on the two railway lines to drive away elephants that come to the tracks and agricultural fields. In addition, Mr. Niraj directed Coimbatore Forest Division officials to use drones fitted with infrared camera to monitor the presence of elephants on or near railway lines. He said that an integrated use of watch towers, foot patrols and drones could avoid elephants being hit by trains. Men engaged in the three works should have frequent communication. The department will suggest to the Southern Railway’s Palakkad division to clear vegetation on the sides of the railway lines that affect the visibility of loco pilots, install more ramps across the tracks to enable easy crossing for elephants and restrict the speed of trains on vulnerable sections and other measures. DFO Ashok Kumar told Mr. Niraj that the team of experts from the Project Elephant Division of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change that inspected railway lines in September this year also proposed installation of additional watch towers. At present, there is a watch tower at a vulnerable section on B line. Mr. Niraj visited A and B lines and a reserve forest patch sandwiched by the two lines. Meanwhile, the Forest Department submitted a wildlife offence report before a judicial magistrate court in Coimbatore in connection with its investigation into the deaths of the three elephants.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/forest-department-proposes-more-watch-towers-for-the-safety-of-elephants/article37763240.ece

Muthukumar of AIADMK so as to contest in the Assembly election. After losing the battle, he again unsuccessfully contested for the 8th ward of the district panchayat against A. Kannaiyan of the DMK recently. It brought down the number of AIADMK members in the 12-member district panchayat to eight from nine. Moreover, the AIADMK numbers came down further as two of its members joined the DMK recently.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/election-for-panchayat-vice-president-post-adjourned-again/article37763342.ece
30 November 2021||KOCHI,TAMIL NADU||A Rs. 1 bounty on giant African snails||An offer to buy the highly invasive African giant snails is not something one comes across very often. But posters, complete with contact numbers, making exactly such an offer are turning heads in the coastal panchayats of Nayarambalam and Njarackal in Kerala. Novel initiative The rather novel initiative is the brainchild of Sunrise, a combine of morning walkers. Since putting up the posters a week ago, they have been flooded with calls from affected people, as the invasive African snails are crop pests apart from posing health hazards. “We buy the African snails at Rs. 1 each. In the one week since we started the initiative, we have bought over 3,500 snails, which were later killed en masse using a saline lotion. In one case, we bought about 600 snails from a single household,” said Avarachan Parakkal, an active member of the group. The group of walkers has been hitting the road every morning without fail for the last four years. The menace posed by African snails came to their notice after they frequently came across them in large numbers on their usual stretch spanning two panchayats. “We started killing them using saline lotions and even sanitisers. But we realised that it was far from adequate, since a majority of snails inhabited private property, which we cannot trespass into without permission. That is when we decided to mobilise funds to buy them,” said Ouseph Valooraan, another member of the group. Purchase and elimination of snails is only the latest of many initiatives by Sunrise, which has been taking up issues of public interest, whether it is waterlogging or bad roads. “We bring raise the matter with the authorities, and if they fail to act, we do whatever we can,” said Jiju Jacob, another member of the 22-member group.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-rs-1-bounty-on-giant-african-snails/article37763139.ece

Apart from the groundwater getting recharged in the locality, the water is meant for irrigation and 2,583 acres of cultivable land in the surroundings would benefit, officials said. Meanwhile, the local people were in an upbeat mood as many youngsters were witnessing such an inflow into the tank, for the first time. “For the youngsters, the tank was used as cricket ground as there was no water for a long time”, said Sethuraman, a retired government official who lives in the vicinity. Joining the farmers, the residents and youngsters celebrated the rising water level as an eventful day and hoisted a pole after performing a puja while playing nagaswaram music. Later, a group of men went on a boat and erected a pole inside the tank. “Only when the water flows two feet above the pole would it mean that the tank has reached its full capacity”, Muthukumar, village head in Madakulam said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/madakulam-tank-to-reach-full-storage-level-in-a-day-or-two/article37763529.ece

A Division Bench of Justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P. Velmurugan sought a response in the PIL petition filed by G. Chidambaram of Thoothukudi district. He said the bridge across Thamirabarani river should be repaired immediately. The NHAI in its status report submitted that the repair works on the entire bridge would be taken up and was pending approval from the competent authority NHAI, Delhi. The court directed NHAI to file the status report with a time schedule with regard to carrying out the entire repair works and also state whether the toll collected would be full or 50 % if the bridge repair works go beyond the estimated time. The hearing was adjourned till December 6. The petitioner said that Vallanaadu bridge on the National Highway road connecting Thoothukudi and Tirunelveli was riddled with potholes. In 2017, there was a huge pothole in the middle of the bridge and it was repaired in a hasty manner. The patchwork had come off and there are more potholes on the road now. Vehicle users are finding it difficult to use the bridge. A reply to an RTI application has revealed that there were 11 accident cases due to the potholes on the bridge from 2012-2021. It resulted in four casualties, he said. He said that he had sent a representation to the NHAI authorities in this regard. They replied stating that due to COVID-19 the inspection committee had not inspected the road. After a recommendation of the committee, the bridge restoration works would begin. But, even after the situation eased, the authorities have not taken any steps to repair the road. The authorities should take immediate steps to repair the road so that accidents on the bridge are prevented, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-seeks-report-from-nhai-on-vallanaadu-bridge/article37763532.ece
30 November 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Omicron threat: screening of passengers intensified at airport||With the threat of omicron variant of COVID-19 looming large, health officials intensified screening of international passengers arriving at Madurai airport on Monday. Besides, the district administration has planned to tighten implementation of social distancing and mask wearing and also impose fines on individual and commercial establishments found flouting the norms, according to Collector, S. Aneesh Sekhar. Talking to The Hindu , here on Monday, Dr. Sekhar said that only those who come with RTPCR negative report would be allowed to board incoming international flights from foreign countries. “Though we do not have direct flights to those countries where omicron viral infection has been detected, we are watching whether someone is coming from those countries through Dubai,” Dr. Sekhar said. Stating that all international passengers will have to undergo seven days home quarantine, Deputy Director (Health), A. Palanisamy, said that those passengers will have to undergo second RTPCR test on the 8th day. Those who test positive on arrival, would be taken to the Government Rajaji Hospital for treatment, he added. Passengers from South Africa, Israel, United Kingdom, New Zealand, Honk Kong, China, Botswana, Singapore, Brazil, Bangladesh, Zimbabwe and from other European countries will be on the watch list. “We are also collecting details of international passengers who had arrived in the last 10 days,” the Collector said. Facilities ready Stating that all required facilities from adequate number of beds to oxygen cylinders were ready in the district, Dr. Sekhar said that whenever the need arose, the facilities would be ramped up. While on an average 3,000 RT-PCR tests were being done every day, he said the number of tests would be increased as contact tracing will be intensified for those testing positive. The district has been reporting positive cases in single digit in recent weeks. Focus on vaccination Stating that vaccination was expected to give protection against Omicron, Dr. Sekhar said that more focus would be given for vaccination of people. Madurai has so far achieved a low target on vaccination front with only 71.5% of eligible population getting the first dose, the Collector said and appealed to the people to come forward to get vaccinated. “Fear among alcohol consumers that they should not drink after taking vaccination has made them hesitant to get the jab,” he said. The district administration would keep a watch at public congregations and insist that those who do not get vaccinated are not allowed in theatres, auditorium and shopping malls in order to encourage vaccination, the Collector said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/omicron-threat-screening-of-passengers-intensified-at-airport/article37763534.ece

Karthikeyan has in a press release condemned the BJP Madurai unit president Saravanan for his remarks against senior Congress leader E. V. K. S. Elangovan. “BJP functionary Saravanan, who is educated and a doctor by profession, should refrain from giving statements like an anti-social. The BJP, instead of showing their mettle in action by bringing in development and growth, are indulging in triggering violence. The public, who are already aware of the designs of the BJP, will naturally reject them, when they talk tall about themselves and their leaders,” Mr Karthikeyan said. Two days ago, Mr Elangovan had described the BJP state president K Annamalai in a distasteful way and as a sequel to it the Madurai BJP functionary had joined issue.

30 November 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Not the time for intra-party issues, says Udayakumar||As the main Opposition party, the AIADMK has the primary responsibility to expose the DMK government’s failures, especially when Chennai and many districts in Tamil Nadu are yet to come out of the problems caused by the rain, senior party leader and former Revenue and Disaster Management Minister R.B. Udayakumar has said. His comments were in an apparent reference to another senior leader A. Anwhar Raajhaa’s remarks in an interview to The Hindu . The AIADMK leadership, he said, had directed the party functionaries to help the needy. It was not the right time to discuss the intra-party affairs, especially in the media, and the functionaries had the prime responsibility to talk out the woes of the common man in one voice, he said. Mr. Udayakumar told The Hindu on Monday that the problems stemming from the rain had not been handled effectively by the government. Though Chief Minister M.K. Stalin and some of the Ministers had been visiting the affected areas, people’s sufferings had not been mitigated. The DMK government, he said, should again bring in the Union Government’s inter-ministerial team to inspect the entire Cauvery delta region because the crop damage was very severe. Everyone who followed the ideals of MGR and Jayalalithaa had the right to protect the AIADMK. Any suggestion, complaint or criticism was welcome. The party had a forum for discussions, and it would be ideal to discuss all issues there, be it of V.K. Sasikala’s readmission or of the alliance with the BJP, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/not-the-time-for-intra-party-issues-says-udayakumar/article37763230.ece

Interested persons should pay a deposit of Rs. 25,000 before participating in the auction at the SP’s office between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. In September this year, the district police in Vellore and Tiruvannamalai auctioned a total of 681 seized vehicles earning a revenue of Rs. 1.16 crore. The seized vehicles had got accumulated in 60 police stations in these districts, over the past two years, as they were unable to auction them due to the pandemic. In Vellore, the Superintendent of Police, S. Selvakumar, has ordered the auction of 528 vehicles, with majority of them being two-wheelers (499), as scrap materials. Most of these vehicles were seized during raids by the Prohibition Enforcement Wing of the district police, while some were involved in accident cases and the others remained unclaimed for the past few years. In the neighbouring Tiruvannamalai district, the police, led by S. Pavan Kumar, Superintendent of Police, organised the auction of 153 seized vehicles earning an income of Rs. 46.94 lakh. Interestingly, more than 90% of the auctioned vehicles in the district were four wheelers as these vehicles were mainly used to transport illicit arrack in the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ranipet-police-to-auction-seized-vehicles-on-friday/article37763659.ece
30 November 2021||SALEM,TAMIL NADU||‘AIADMK will appeal against HC order on Veda Nilayam’||AIADMK co-coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Monday said the party would appeal against the recent order of the Madras High Court quashing the proposed conversion of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s Veda Nilayam bungalow in Chennai into a memorial. He told journalists in Salem that the place where Jayalalithaa lived was like a temple to AIADMK cadres. Hence the party had decided to convert it into a memorial. The High Court’s order had upset the party members and therefore they would discuss and challenge the same. Mr. Palaniswami, who visited the AIADMK’s Salem urban district office and assessed progress of collection of applications for the urban local body elections, said the DMK government was adopting dual standards on the release of life convicts in the former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. He alleged that Electricity Minister V. Senthil Balaji was trying to lure local body representatives of the AIADMK in Karur by registering false cases. Claiming that the government was attempting to shut down ‘Amma clinics’, he urged the rulers to continue the scheme. On the losses faced by delta farmers, Mr. Palaniswami said the government should assess crop damage and provide a compensation of Rs. 40,000 per hectare for paddy crop, to be harvested in a month, and Rs. 60,000 per hectare for those ready for harvest. He urged the State to offer compensation of Rs. 15 lakh for the Salem gas cylinder blast victims and Rs. 2 lakh for the grievously injured, and to construct new houses for them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-will-appeal-against-madras-high-court-order-on-veda-nilayam/article37763275.ece

30 November 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||Association plea to revive Chennai-Karaikudi train service||The Thanjavur District Railway Users Association on Monday called upon Southern Railway to revive the Chennai-Karaikudi train service through Pattukottai that was withdrawn a decade ago. A resolution to this effect was adopted at a meeting held in Kumbakonam.

30 November 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Flood situation continues to be grim||As the situation caused by flooding in some parts of the city continued to be grim, authorities on Monday closed the busy Vayalur Road and Tiruchi-Kuzhumani Road for traffic. Vehicular movement on Tiruchi-Dindigul Road was disrupted for many hours due to heavy flow of water on the roads. There was no relief in sight for residents of Shanmuga Nagar, Ganapathy Nagar, M.M. Nagar and neighbourng colonies on Vayalur Road, who spent a sleepless night due to knee-deep to waist-deep waterlogging in their areas. The overnight rise in water level in the Kudamuriti and the Ariyar kept them on tenterhooks in the intervening night of Sunday and Monday. Besides inundating many colonies, the spill-over from the Kudamuriti began flowing on Vayalur Road from early morning near Shanmuga Nagar and kept increasing until afternoon. No two-wheeler could pass on the road. As the water current seemed to be stronger at a few points, authorities suspended road traffic on Vayalur Road as a precautionary measure. Since the water was flowing on Tiruchi-Kuzhumani Road it was also closed for traffic, thereby forcing both Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) and private bus operators to suspend their services to Kuzhumani, Vayalur, Somarasampettai, Allithurai, Ettarai, Koppu, North Ariyavur, Neithalur and a few other villages. “Several residents on Vayalur road spent the night watching the water level. We couldn’t sleep properly as it brought back the nightmarish experience of the 2005 flood. It is unfortunate that the issue has not been solved yet,” says S. Sridhar, a resident of Rettaivaickal. While heavy rain in catchment areas and overflowing tanks in Manapparai in Tiruchi district and Viralimalai in Pudukottai district brought in heavy flow in the Koraiyar and the Ariyar, the breach of bund of the Ariyar near Punganur compounded the situation. It caused a rise in the water level in the Kudamuriti. The spillover of water at many points along the Ariyar and the Koraiyar caused water inundation in many colonies such as Prattiyur, Murugan Nagar, Dheeran Nagar and others on Tiruchi-Dindigul road. Murugan Nagar on Tiruchi-Dindigul Road was hit hard. Water entered more than 200 houses in a few colonies. The flow of water on the busy road also threw vehicle movement out of gear for more than four hours in the morning. However, services resumed in the afternoon. According to an official, about 7,000 to 8,000 cusecs of water from the Koraiyar and the Ariyar was flowing in the Kudamuriti on Sunday night and Monday. The flow came down a little in the afternoon. Collector S. Sivarasu, who visited various parts of the district including Piratiyur, Kuzhumani, Thuraiyur and Manapparai to study the flood situation, told The Hindu that the respite in rain in Manapparai and Viralimalai regions on Monday brought down the water flow in the Koraiyar, the Ariyar and the Kudamuriti since afternoon. Steps had been taken to plug the breach in the bund of Ariyar near Punganur. Officials of the Public Works Department had been asked to keep vigil. The water flow in wild streams from Pudukottai and Dindigul districts were adding to the heavy discharge into the Kudamuriti. The situation was being closely monitored, Mr. Sivarasu added. P.M.N. Mujibur Rahuman, Corporation Commissioner, said the situation had begun to improve as water flow in the Kudamuriti had started receding.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/flood-situation-continues-to-be-grim/article37763636.ece

30 November 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Ponmalai railway subway closed due to water seepage||The Ponmalai railway subway, which was constructed in place of a manned level-crossing between Ponmalai and Tiruverumbur railway stations. has been inundated with rainwater. The subway has developed defects inckuding water seepage through the walls. According to official sources, 16 pre-cast concrete boxes have been used in the subway construction coming up to a length of 25 metres and covering all three railway tracks at a cost of Rs. 5.13 crore. Following rain in the city since Thursday night, water has begun to seep in through the gaps between the boxes and also through the sloping paths on either side. Officials have cordoned off both entrances to the subway. Railway employees, residents of Ambikapuram and Ariyamangalam depend on the subway to reach Ponmalai railway station. “As most trains do not stop at Manjattidal railway station, they take the subway to go to Ponmalai. Now, they are forced to take the long route via Ariyamangalam,” a user said. Speaking to The Hindu , K. C. Neelamegam, State advisor of Makkal Sakthi Iyakkam, says that apart from workers, people depend on the subway to reach the school and hospital meant for railway employees in Ponmalai. “Even the general public take this route to reach Pudukottai Road. In case of emergencies, especially during the monsoon, it will be an added hardship to take the longer route," he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ponmalai-railway-subway-closed-due-to-water-seepage/article37763638.ece
30 November 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Residents forced to stay indoors as breach in Ariyar causes inundation||A breach in the Ariyar on the outskirts of Tiruchi inundated residential areas in Pirattiyur, Punganur, Iniyanur and surrounding areas and the Public Works Department was engaged in repairing the 50-metre-wide breach on Monday. Prattiyur, Murugan Nagar, Dheeran Nagar, Cauvery Nagar and other localities connected to Tiruchi-Dindigul Highway were inundated for the second consecutive day. Workers of shops and showrooms on Dindigul Road, at Karumandapam and beyond spent hours standing in knee-deep water attempting to clear the traffic which had come to a standstill. In Pirattiyur, the Panchayat Union Primary School declared a two-day holiday as residential areas surrounding the building were inundated. Ramesh Kumar, a teacher, said many made their way to the campus that was at a higher elevation to safeguard themselves from the rising water level. Varma Nagar, which was located on the banks of the Ariyar, was the worst-affected with people finding themselves forced to stay indoors with no access to food or water. Personnel of Fire and Rescue Services and State Disaster Management Authority were deployed to rescue residents. The Public Works Department deployed its workers to stack sandbags strengthened with wooden frames to plug the breach. “Water entered our home on Saturday night and the water level kept rising steadily. We contacted our relatives in Manapparai who said the rain have stopped there, so we are hoping for some relief soon,” Vasanthi, a resident of Varma Nagar said. Children, who had to go to school, were forced to stay home, while the bread winners were forced to seek leave. Speaking to The Hindu , a senior PWD official said the 50-metre wide breach occurred near Punganur, allowing water to rush into the residential areas. Ariyar was at capacity — 14,000 cusecs — and more rain would worsen the situation. The waterbody filled up through rain in Manapparai, Maravanur and its surrounding areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/residents-forced-to-stay-indoors-as-breach-in-ariyar-causes-inundation/article37763640.ece
30 November 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Book on Srirangam’s architecture released||A glossy book on the temple town of Srirangam was launched on Saturday, with the authors appealing for more such volumes from architects to scientifically document heritage structures in Tamil Nadu.  Srirangam Art and Architecture , written by danseuse and columnist Vrinda Ramanan and illustrated with photographs by her husband J. Ramanan, makes a detailed study of classical mural art and sculpture seen in Srirangam’s pavilions, shrines and temple towers. The text also explains some of the stories and mythological references related to the ancient structures. Speaking at the launch ceremony, Mr. Ramanan, an architect, said: “There is a paucity of books related to the history of the Deccan and southern India, particularly Tamil Nadu. Though we have many Western writers who have tried to study this region, the information in these books is not complete and needs further research. For students of architecture, especially, we need volumes that contain measured drawings, so that they can understand the technical aspects of the structures too. I hope the schools of architecture in our State can add this subject to the curriculum as well.” The launch was preceded by the screening of a short film titled Srirangam – A Town in Peril . The book was released by architect C. R. Raju, president of Indian Institute of Architects (IIA), and the first copy was received by T. Arun Raj, Superintending Archaeologist, Archaeological Survey of India, Tiruchi. Senior officials of the regional chapters of IIA were also felicitated.

30 November 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||2 held for realtor murder||Somarasampet Police have booked a case against four persons, including DMK Andhanallur union secretary P. Kathirvel and Ravi Murugaiah, chairman, Vasan Estates, in connection with the murder of P. Sivakumar (50) who was involved in real estate business at Sengathirsolai village near Tiruchi on Sunday evening. The case was booked against them on a complaint preferred by Sivakumar's wife S. Mythili (35). Of the four accused named in the murder case, the Somarasampet Police on Monday arrested N. Prabhakaran (34) and A. Deepak (28). The other two persons named as accused were yet to be arrested, police sources said. The sources said Malliyampathu panchayat president Vigneswaran had the encroachments in Sengathirsolai cremation ground removed through government officials recently. The action caused problems for Sivakumar as an impression had gained ground that he was instrumental in the removal of encroachments. Mythili, in her complaint to the Somarasampet Police on Sunday, stated that her husband was attacked with wooden logs by Prabhakaran and Deepak, also from Sengathirsolai village, leading to his death at the instigation of Kathirvel and Ravi Murugaiah and sought action against the four. Based on the complaint, the Somarasampet Police registered a case under IPC sections, including 302 (murder) 109 (abetment), naming Prabhakaran, Deepak, Kathirvel and Ravi Murugaiah as the accused.

30 November 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Flood again in Tamirabharani, people alerted||The Tamirabharani experienced flood again on Monday following heavy rainfall in catchment areas of the major dams in the Western Ghats on Sunday night. After the catchment areas of Papanasam Dam recorded 91 mm of rainfall on Sunday night, the reservoir, which is just five feet away from reaching its maximum level of 143 feet, received over 10,000 cusecs of water. Consequently, over 8,000 cusecs water was discharged from the Papanasam Dam. Meanwhile, over 2,000 cusecs of water was discharged from Gadana Dam in Tenkasi, which is about to reach its maximum level of 85 feet. As the heavy discharge of water from Papanasam and Gadana Dams swelled Tamirabharani again, people living close to the watercourse were alerted. Though the catchment areas of Manimuthar Dam received 84 mm of rainfall on Sunday night and the inflow rose to 4,393 cusecs, no water was discharged from the district’s largest reservoir as the dam, having 107 feet water against its maximum level of 118 feet, now has only 81% of water. Since the Indian Meteorological Department had issued ‘orange alert’ to Tenkasi, Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi districts on Monday, Collectors declared holiday for schools and colleges anticipating downpour. However, none of these three districts experienced rain during the day. In case of waterlogging in the residential areas, the public may register their complaints via https://nellaineervalam.in/waterlogging/ so that the officials concerned will be instructed to look into the complaints immediately for taking appropriate action, Collector V. Vishnu has said. When the block in Vazhukkodai in Tirunelveli Town caused waterlogging in Kaatchi Mandapam and adjoining areas and it was brought to the notice of the Collector, it was cleared by the Fire and the Rescue Services personnel immediately. In Thoothukudi, the water stagnation woes in Bryant Nagar, Kurinji Nagar, Muthammal Colony, Ram Nagar, Rahmath Nagar, Dhanasekaran Nagar, Kathirvel Nagar and nearby areas continue to haunt the residents even after four days. Even though 313 motors have been pumping out the stagnant rainwater from various parts of the port town, the residents’ sufferings continue. Since the roads have to be cut for laying pipes to pump out the stagnant rainwater, the road-users, especially the two-wheeler riders, suffer a lot. In Velankanni Nagar near Krishnarajapuram, the rainwater pumped out from nearby areas has stagnated in all the streets of this residential area to cause agony to the residents for the past four days. As no Corporation official visited this area even after repeated complaints and appeals to drain the rainwater mixed with sewage, the residents are living with fear of contracting water-borne and vector-borne diseases. “If no step is taken to mitigate our sufferings on Tuesday, we’ve decided to send SOS to the Chief Minister’s Office through all social medial platforms and hoist black flags in our area, which will be aired live on social media platforms from Tuesday onwards,” said a resident of Velankanni Nagar. When a review meeting was chaired by Commissioner for Industries and Special Officer Siji Thomas Vaidyan on Monday in the presence of Minister for Social Welfare P. Geetha Jeevan, Collector K. Senthil Raj and Corporation Commissioner T. Charusree, the minister said effective steps were being taken to pump out the stagnant rainwater. “Even as supply of essential commodities like milk, vegetables, grocery items etc. to the residents has been ensured, the corporation officials are taking steps to check possible spread of vector and water-borne diseases,” Ms. Geetha said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/flood-in-tamirabharani/article37763360.ece
30 November 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Bus stand traders seek re-allotment of shops||Demanding allotment of shops in the renovated Palayamkottai bus stand at nominal rental charges, traders, who had their shops before the renovation commenced a year ago, staged a dharna here on Monday. After closing down their shops, the traders, who gathered at the ground on South Bazaar, raised slogans in support of their demands. According to A.J.M. Solomon, president of Palayamkottai Gandhi Market Traders’ Association, the traders having their shops in the bus terminus for more than 60 years, had to move out following the corporation’s decision to reconstruct the bus stand under the Smart City project. After the traders paid their rental charges without arrears, they were given temporary shops at alternative place. While moving to the temporary shops, they had appealed to the corporation to allot shops again without any precondition after reconstruction of the bus stand. “Though the corporation had agreed in principle to allot the shops again to the traders, who already had their business there for several decades, the urban civic body, on the completion of the construction of 30 shops in the ground and the first floor, conducted auction for the shops on November 10 last in which only two shops were taken on lease. Hence, the corporation has decided to conduct re-auction for the remaining shops, which is gross violation of its promise of giving shops to the traders,” he said. He said the “exorbitant” rental charge fixed by the corporation was the prime reason behind the lack of interest among the traders in taking the shops on lease. “While the rental charges for one square feet in a private building near the Palayamkottai is only Rs. 40 while the Corporation has fixed it as Rs. 200 (excluding GST) for the shops in the ground floor and Rs. 150 for the shops in the first floor. The traders have to pay up to Rs. 1 crore as deposit to the corporation for the shop while this amount is only Rs. 1 lakh for shops in private buildings,” he said. He pointed out that the “unrealistic designing and construction” had transformed the Palayamkottai bus stand into a bus stop now. “The Palayamkottai bus terminus, which was handling simultaneously several buses and a few thousand students and the public everyday, has become a bus-stop as it can accommodate only 3 or 4 buses at a time. In other words, the bus-stand’s inability to handle more buses simultaneously will badly affect the traders’ business even though they have to give high rental charges,” he said. He said the Chief Minister, as per the Government Order issued in July 2007, should give shops to the person who had taken on lease or his partner or his legal heir at the affordable rental charges with 12 months rent as deposit. Since the Tamil Nadu Government was following the practice of hiking 15% in the rent for every 3 years, it should be applied to the shops of renovated bus stand also for fixing the rental charges, he noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bus-stand-traders-seek-re-allotment-of-shops/article37763653.ece

Appavu released water from Nambiyar Dam at Kottaikarungulam near Valliyoor on Monday which will nourish paddy to be raised on 1,744.55 acres during this ‘pisanam’ season. Water has been released even as the dam is overflowing on reaching its maximum storage level of 22.96 feet and getting 400 cusecs of water thanks to the active monsoon along the Western Ghats. Speaking to reporters, he said 60 cusecs of water is being released from the reservoir, having the total capacity of 82 million cubic feet , to feed 40 irrigation tanks in this region having an ayacut of over 1,744 acres. In other words, the water will resurrect paddy cultivation in Kottaikarungulam, Kasthurirengapuram, Kumarapuram, Thisaiyanvilai, Urumankulam, Muthumoththaanmozhi, Karaisuttrupudur, Aayankulam Padugai and Aanaikudi Padugai. Water for paddy cultivation will be released for 120 days. If the inflow of water dips considerably following dry spell, water from the reservoir will be released on turn basis. On the progress in the Tamirabharani – Karumaeniyar – Nambiyar linking scheme, which is being implemented to take the surplus water of the Tamirabharani to the dry regions of Nanguneri, Thisaiyanvilai and Sattankulam by digging the flood carrier channel, he said the project would get completed in March next year. “Construction of a bridge on the Tirunelveli – Nagercoil four-lane national highway at Ponnaakudi near Tirunelveli has commenced as the flood carrier channel will cross the road at this point. Proposals have been sent to the Ministry of Railways for construction of another bridge near this point for unhindered rail traffic. We expect that construction of both the bridges will be completed in March 2022,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/water-released-from-nambiyar-dam/article37763656.ece
30 November 2021||Tiruppur,TAMIL NADU||Surplus water released from Uppar dam||Farmers in Dharapuram and Kundadam areas of Tiruppur district are hoping for a year free of water woes after witnessing the release of surplus water from Uppar dam after a gap of over 15 years. Officials from the Water Resources Department of the Public Works Department said that the surplus water was released into River Uppar at the rate of around 500 cusecs at around 9.10 p.m. on Saturday. Due to increased inflow of water into Thirumoorthy Dam following heavy rain, water was released via the Parambikulam Main Canal to Uppar dam from November 8. Amid heavy rain in Dharapuram and Kundadam areas along with the inflow from Thirumoorthy dam, the water level rose steadily and it almost touched the full reservoir level of 24 feet on Saturday evening, the officials said. Following this, the officials opened the shutters of the Uppar dam to release the surplus water into the river and issued a flood alert to those living near the river. Prior to this, the surplus water was released from Uppar dam only in December 2005, according to the officials. Farmers and the public celebrated with fireworks and cheer at the Uppar dam on Saturday evening as the past decade was marked with several protests demanding release of adequate water to the dam. R. Muruganantham, executive committee member of Tiruppur District Uppar Farmers’ Protection Association, said that the farmers expect the water to be released for irrigating over 6,000 acres of agricultural lands in January next year. “We hope that the water stored in the dam will be sufficient till next year. Due to heavy rain, the groundwater table in these areas have also increased,” he said. Mr. Muruganantham said that farmers could cultivate crops such as cotton, groundnut, maize and paddy and vegetables such as tomatoes and drumsticks on a larger scale with the increased water supply. The officials said that surplus water through the Parambikulam Main Canal was diverted to Vattamalaikarai Odai reservoir near Vellakoil on Sunday afternoon and the inflow was around 200 cusecs. President of Vattamalaikarai Odai Farmers’ Welfare Association K. Palanisamy on Monday welcomed the move as the reservoir had not received adequate water for nearly two decades. The release of water would benefit around 6,043 acres in Kangeyam Block, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/surplus-water-released-from-uppar-dam-after-15-years/article37763288.ece

Starting her concert with Gopalakrishna Bharathiyaar’s Shivaloka Nathanai in Raga Mayamalavagowla, which brought the Nandanar story of inviting everybody to come and visit Tirupunkur Shiva Temple, it was followed by Thyagaraja, ‘Sitapatina manasuna’, in raga khamas, which set the tone for the concert. She then rendered a long alapana for Shyamaa Sastry’s “Meenalochana brova” in Dhanyasi. Next piece was the violinist’s own composition on Goddess Meenakshi in Yamunakalyani Ragam, which was well received by the audience. The main raga of the evening “Bhairavi” for saint Tyagarajar’s “Upacharamulanu”, in which the strong team of accompanists and the melodious singing of Amritha Murali contributed heavily towards the success of the recital. The rendering generated a peaceful, serious and stimulated the sentiment of sadness of the Saint. She concluded her concert with a song in praise of the Tamil Language by Bharathiar “ Vazhga nirantharam Vazhiya Tamizh mozhi”. The rendition of a few stanzas of the "kongalarndha malar" from "Periya Thirumozhi " by Thirumangai Azhvar moved the audience to a different devotional level. The raga alapana for the songs which showcased her in-built talent and the compositions by the violinist R K Shriramkumar, showed his versatility.

This amounted to an overall import duty of 11%, he said. Mr. Stalin said another reason for the cotton price increase was the bulk discount offered by the Cotton Corporation of India to traders who procured almost 70% of minimum support price cotton auctioned at a lower rate during the cotton season. Then the traders speculated on the market. He requested Mr. Goyal to remove the 11% import duty; cut the minimum lot at e-auction to 500 bales; and give priority to yarn manufacturers in cotton procurement over traders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/remove-duty-on-cotton-imports-cm/article37763233.ece

30 November 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Prayer groups in Belagavi anxious despite assurances by police officers||Christian prayer groups in Belagavi that used to hold prayer meetings on weekends have stopped conducting them in halls and open grounds following alleged threats by Hindutva outfits. A sense of insecurity continues among them with attacks on priests who were charged with engaging in “illegal conversions”. Added to this is the advisory by some police officers asking a few Christian institutions not to hold public prayers to avoid confrontation with right-wing groups. This, the officers reasoned, was “in their own interest” and to ensure peace in the district. Fear among minority groups continues even after K. Thiyagarajan, Police Commissioner, told a delegation of Christian leaders that no officer had issued any advisory or order, written or oral. Those with churches “The police have told prayer groups that only those denominations with churches will be allowed to pray. All others have stopped public prayers. Some are holding prayers in houses of believers. Some are doing it online,” said Nanda Kumar, district superintendent of the Belagavi Methodist Church. However, Mr. Thiyagarajan told The Hindu on Sunday: “Anybody can practice any faith. There is no need for fear or panic. We only request all groups to follow COVID-19 protocol and other regulations.” Despite such assurances, there is a sense of fear, say community leaders. “Priests from the community have faced at least 15 attacks from right-wing groups in the last one year. But the police have not helped us. Instead, they are asking us to stop conducting prayers,” said Sudhakar J.S., a pastor from Belagavi. He said that some police officers had told pastors that they had to avoid problems till the winter session of the State Legislature was over. Cases against priests “On most occasions, the police have refused to register a case against the attackers. On the contrary, they have filed cases against the priests in two cases. Only in one instance, a case has been registered against the attackers,” he said. The advisory by the police came in the backdrop of an attack by Sri Ram Sena- Hindustan (SRSH) members on a Protestant congregation at Maratha Colony in Belagavi a few days ago. SRSH members had allegedly locked up the prayer hall and abused the pastor. The city police had booked the pastor for holding a prayer meeting without due permission. Protestant leader Immanuel Gaekwad of Belagavi Bible Church said the police had asked him to shut down a hall that he had rented out to hold prayers. He had been using the prayer hall for over three years. Pastor T. Thomas of Full Gospel said the police had told 25 prayer groups not to assemble in community halls or other private properties. “We told them that all our prayer groups were registered under Societies Act or Trust Act. But, they did not agree. This has hurt our feelings,” he said. Fundamental right Rev. Fr. Derek Fernandes, Bishop of Belagavi diocese, said the community was concerned about such developments. “Professing any faith and conducting prayers are the fundamental rights of any citizen of India. Ideally, the police should protect us and not ask us to refrain from public prayers,” he said. He thanked the commissioner for promising safety.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/prayer-groups-in-belagavi-anxious-despite-assurances-by-police-officers/article37763216.ece

30 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Residents protest seeking closure of waste processing plant at Chigaranahalli||For the fifth consecutive day, garbage-laden trucks were denied entry into the waste processing plant at Chigaranahalli, on the city’s outskirts. Communities, who are staging a protest under the aegis of Nava Bengaluru Horata Samiti, alleged that leachate from the plant run by MSGP Infratech Pvt. Ltd. has contaminated water sources following the spate of heavy rains. With residents staging a protest at Gundlahalli Cross on the way to Chigarenahalli, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) had to send back 10 compactors on Monday itself. Govindaraj, a community leader, told The Hindu that leachate had contaminated the Battarahalli lake and Mavatoorkere, which is in the catchment area of Byragondalu dam. The dam, which is around 5 km from the plant, is part of the Yettinahole water project. This is not the first time residents have staged protests demanding that the plant be closed. In March last year, they went on a similar stir and rejected reconciliatory attempts. Later, they met with then Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who stated that while the plant would continue to function, corrective action would be taken. Chandra Tejaswi, secretary of Karnataka Pranta Raita Sangha, Bengaluru (Rural) district, claimed that none of the assurances were met. “After the pandemic, the number of vehicles coming to the plant has only increased. No measures have been taken to either reduce the stench or scientifically process the plant,” he said. After the heavy rains, the leachate flowed out of the plant and contaminated the water sources, and the processing of waste has also reduced drastically, said Mr. Govindaraj. “We were assured that only 40 vehicles would be sent to the plant. However, more than 200 vehicles can be seen going to the plant every day,” he said, and added that it was after a lot of struggle by the local communities that another plant near Doddabelavangala was shut down in 2016. The BBMP used to send around 500 tonnes of waste to the plant every day. However, since the protest started, waste has been diverted to other processing units and a portion is sent to the landfill. “Following heavy rains, one of the leachate tanks overflowed and the tank breached. This flowed around 3-4 km and contaminated a few watersheds. We have filed an FIR against the owner of the plant at Chikkabelavangala police station,” explained Sarfaraz Khan, BBMP Joint Commissioner (Solid Waste Management). The Deputy Commissioner and the Superintendent of Police of Bengaluru (Rural) district have been in talks with the communities trying to convince them to withdraw their stir.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/residents-protest-seeking-closure-of-waste-processing-plant-at-chigaranahalli/article37763203.ece

30 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||MD of company held in cheating scam||The cyber crime police on Monday arrested the managing director of a financial solutions firm for allegedly cheating an insurance agent by guaranteeing him a deal with a leading IT firm for a commission of Rs. 14 lakh. The accused, Nischith C.S., who ran Stake Management Solutions Pvt. Ltd.(e-Profitsure), hired call centre employees to convince people to do business with his firm, said the police. Employees were instructed to offer different business solutions ranging from real estate to insurance cover depending on the profile of a potential client. Using this modus operandi, Nischith convinced an insurance agent from Banashankari that he could get him a mass deal with a leading IT firm. The accused created a fake email of the HR of the MNC to gain his trust. He took a commission of Rs. 14 lakh from the agent to secure the deal. When he realised that he had been cheated, the agent approached the police, who arrested Nischith. “Inquiries revealed that the accused had cheated many people across the State offering loans, real estate deals, tax consultation and financial advice and business leads for insurance companies and agents,” said the police.

30 November 2021||Chennai/Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Rain effect: After 11 years, Cauvery witnesses record flow||Bountiful flow is being witnessed on the Cauvery river in a sustained manner during the northeast monsoon (October-December). As of date, the realisation of the Cauvery water, as measured at Biligundlu, was 118.62 thousand million cubic feet (tmcft) since October 1. It was during the 2010 monsoon that the realisation crossed the three-digit figure, which was 107 tmcft. According to Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC), between October 1 and November 25, south-interior Karnataka region received 454 mm of rainfall against a normal of 185.7 mm, highest for the region in the last 50 years. This coupled with rains in Tamil Nadu augmented the quantum of water flow to the Mettur dam. A perusal of the data of flows measured at Biligundlu, located on the border of Karnataka-Tamil Nadu, since 1974-75 reveals that the cumulative realisation during the monsoon exceeded the three-digit figure on 10 occasions, including the current year. [The year 1974-75 has been taken into account as it was in 1974 that the 1924 inter-State agreement on the sharing of the Cauvery river water came for review]. Till now, the highest quantity during the three-month-period was 167 tmcft in 2005 followed by 152 tmcft in 2000 and 137 tmcft in 1977. The current month’s realisation of the Cauvery water by Tamil Nadu - 70.34 tmcft - has become the highest quantum for November in the last 47 years. The previous best was 61.18 tmcft in 2010. Last month, the State received 48.28 tmcft. As on Monday, the total realisation for the current year (since June 1) was 210.08 tmcft, an excess of 53.4 tmcft for the elapsed period of the year. Mettur reservoir The Mettur reservoir, about 70 km downstream of Biligundlu, remained at the full level of 120 ft with the storage being 93.47 tmcft. About 22,830 cubic feet per second (cusecs) was being discharged through the river while the inflow was 21,725 cusecs. Karnataka is mandated to release 177.25 tmcft of water to Tamil Nadu every year between June 1 and May 30. Notwithstanding the fluctuations in the monthly discharge, the cumulative outflow from the KRS and the Kabini since the last three years is over and above what is prescribed by the apex court. In 2020-21, the cumulative discharge from the KRS and the Kabini was 222 tmcft, it was 284 tmcft in 2019-20, and 432 tmcft in 2018-19, as per data from KSNDMC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rain-effect-after-11-years-cauvery-witnesses-record-flow/article37763210.ece
30 November 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Survey on conversion in two villages found it was voluntary||It has come to light that Hosadurga taluk administration in Chitradurga district had conducted a survey on the religious conversions in two villages of the taluk a few weeks ago and conveyed the findings to the higher-ups in the government. The officers, led by tahsildar Y. Thippeswamy, found that 42 families had converted to Christianity. Hosadurga MLA Gulihatti Shekhar of the BJP had raised the issue in the Legislature session, alleging that over 20,000 people of his constituency had been converted to Christianity and his mother was one among them. Recently, Mr. Shekhar claimed that his mother and four families, who had converted to Christianity, had returned to Hinduism. When The Hindu contacted Mr. Thippeswamy, on Monday, he said he along with the Circle Inspector and his staff visited the two villages, one in Srirampura Hobli and another in Madadakere Hobli to inquire about religious conversions. “In one place, we noticed around 30 families converted to Christianity and in another, about 12 families had converted. Upon enquiry, they said they accepted the religion voluntarily for mental peace and happiness. They said they were neither forced nor lured,” he said. “Whatever we gathered from the local people was conveyed to senior officers orally,” the officer added. Earlier this year, a similar exercise was conducted by the police separately. Then too the police officer had denied the allegations of forced conversion.

During the demonstrations, the law students urged the university authorities to clear the confusion over the academic year calendar and take steps to allow the law students to complete their courses within the stipulated academic calendar. In Hubballi, the law students, led by office-bearers of National Students Union of India (NSUI), took out a protest march from the Hubballi-Dharwad Road to the KSLU campus at Navanagar raising slogans against the university and seeking justice. Speaking to presspersons, the NSUI office-bearers said that there was total confusion with regard to the examinations and academic calendar at KSLU. The KSLU has failed to safeguard the interests of the students who have been put under tremendous pressure due to the inconsistent decisions.

30 November 2021||Hyderabad,KARNATAKA||Teens to seniors in ‘digital’ honey trap||Age knows no limits when it comes to falling into digital honeytraps in India. Men of all ages — from a teenager to sexagenarians — faced extortion after they were honeytrapped with fake social media profiles of women, sleazy chats and compromising video calls. Since the beginning of this year, the cybercrime police of Cyberabad alone registered 82 cases in which people from all age groups were blackmailed and duped by fraudsters, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crimes) Rohini Priyadarshini told The Hindu . She said over Rs. 1.30 crore was extorted from the 82 victims with the maximum amount being more than Rs. 10 lakh swindled from a single person. The majority of victims are aged between 25 and 35 years with 61 cases being registered, followed by 11 cases in which people from 40 to 60 years were honey-trapped. “In 10 cases, the victims are aged between 35 and 40 years,” Ms. Priyadarshini said. Fear of stigma Though the number of victims is reportedly high compared to cases booked across the State, many do not approach the police due to social stigma. The rise in cases can be attributed to the pandemic, as more and more people are home and working or just surfing online, the officer said. According to Ms. Priyadarshini, the extortion is done using various methods. One modus operandi consists of chatting on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and online platforms with unsuspecting young women or men posing as women and getting them to send compromising pictures of themselves, and digitally honeytrap the victims with video calls. “The short video calls are recorded using screen recording applications and are immediately sent to the victims for blackmailing,” she said. They threaten the victims that they would upload naked videos on the Internet and share them with their friends and relatives if they do not transfer money to their bank accounts. Initially, they demand anywhere between Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 20,000 and once the victims start paying, they extort more through online banking. Such calls mostly originate from the Siliguri area in West Bengal and so far no arrests were made in any of these cases as tracing the cyber crooks with IP addresses is a challenging task. People who visit pornographic websites are also targeted by these gangs as they place links on websites which record the victim’s activities. Further, the DCP said people should not accept video calls and friend requests from strangers. “Even if they do, they should avoid any indecent request from a stranger during a video call, as they will be recorded and misused for extortion,” she said requesting people not to transfer money and instead approach the police. Police said that even women get sextorted by the fraudsters who threaten them to make their morphed photos public. “They download the photos of women from their social media accounts, morph them with photos of naked women and blackmail them and demand money,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/teens-to-seniors-in-digital-honey-trap/article37763095.ece
30 November 2021||KOCHI,KARNATAKA||Kerala HC comes down on ‘ego, arrogance of khaki’||The Kerala High Court on Monday berated a former Pink Police officer who had allegedly humiliated an eight-year-old girl by accusing her of stealing her mobile phone. The court termed the officer’s behaviour towards the girl ‘ego and arrogance of khaki.’ Justice Devan Ramachandran made these observations when a petition filed by the girl seeking a directive to the State Government to take strict action against civil police officer Rejitha came up for hearing. The judge, who watched a video of the incident, termed it disturbing. He said he was moved by the sight of the child crying  upon being confronted by the woman officer. The girl was terrified. The family belonged to a vulnerable section of society. When the missing phone was found, the police officer could have apologised to the child. The matter would have ended there, the judge said. “Will the girl have confidence in the police now? Will she regard the police as protector?” The court asked what would have happened if the missing phone was in silent mode. The girl and her father would have been put behind bars. “It all happened because of the carelessness of the police officer. The officer had judged the girl’s father by his looks and clothes,” he said. The court directed the State Police Chief (SPC) to file a report on the issue. The petitioner had said that the police had not taken the statements of her or her father even three months after the incident. Treatment details The court asked the SPC to keep in mind the fact that the petitioner was under severe emotional stress on account of the behaviour of the police officer.

30 November 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Screening, testing resumes on the border at Talapady||Melwyn D’Souza of Manjeshwar in Kerala, a final year nursing student from a college here, while returning home, got off the bus at Talapady on Monday evening. He and his classmate, also from Manjeshwar, have been asked by the college to produce COVID-19 negative certificate on Wednesday. “We cannot afford to pay Rs. 800 and get RT-PCR test done. As the testing is done free here and as it is also convenient, we both underwent the test,” Melwyn D’Souza said. The Health Department personnel told them that the test report will be available by Tuesday evening. Melwyn D’Souza was among the many students and other regular commuters between Kasaragod in Kerala and Mangaluru who underwent RT-PCR test at the testing centre that resumed round-the-clock functioning at Talapady on Monday after orders came from the State Government. On the first day, more than 200 people were tested. While tests and screening of people are being done at Talapady, only screening is being done at Jalsoor and other border areas of the district, said District Health and Family Welfare Officer M. Kishore Kumar. The police and Health Department personnel will work in three shifts to screen people round the clock. Screening and testing have not been stopped in Mangaluru Junction and Mangaluru Central railway stations, he said. Dr. Kishore Kumar, who was at Talapady, said that colleges have been asked to ensure that all students who are commuting daily from Kasaragod district should get their tests done once in every fortnight. Buses operating between Dakshina Kannada and Kasaragod have been asked to ensure that commuters carry their RT-PCR test negative certificate when they are boarding buses that are bound for Dakshina Kannada. COVID-19 Nodal Officer H. Ashok said that the airport officials have been told to conduct rapid tests of all those coming from Maharashtra. Passengers coming from high-risk countries and landing in the city airport by domestic flights should be tested and if they are found positive for COVID-19, they will be sent for 15 days institutional quarantine. If they are found negative, they have to remain under home quarantine and get tested after seven days. Private airlines have been asked to ensure compliance with these norms, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/screening-testing-resumes-on-the-border-at-talapady/article37763552.ece
30 November 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||ANF is more relevant now, says DG&IGP Praveen Sood||With the recent government action against Maoist activists across the country, including the arrest of B.G. Krishnamoorthy and Savitri, who were wanted in several cases in the State, the Anti Naxal Force is more relevant now, Director-General and Inspector-General of Police Praveen Sood has said. Talking to The Hindu here on Sunday, Mr. Sood, who was in Mangaluru for a review meeting, said that there are Maoists who are still underground. “With the recent action, there is likely to be frustration among those who are underground. The ANF is more relevant now. We will continue our action against these extremist Maoist activists,” he said. More focus, Mr. Sood said, will be on tri-junction areas bordering Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Police out-posts are being set up in areas such as Kutta in Kodagu district and Beechanahalli in Heggadadevanakote taluk of Mysuru district. Living conditions in the ANF camps are being improved to meet the prevailing COVID-19 norms, he said. It may be mentioned here that the National Investigation Agency on November 9 arrested Krishnamoorthy and Savitri from the area adjoining Karnataka and Kerala. Krishnamoorthy hailed from Sringeri and Savitri is from Kalasa. Krishnamoorthy was associated with Save Kudremukh and other agitations in the Malnad region since 2000. He reportedly led the Maoist activities in the State. Savitri was area commander of the Kabini Dalam of the Maoists. Krishnamoorthy was wanted in 30 cases, including those registered under the Arms Act and Unlawful Activities Prevention Act in Chikkamagaluru. Savitri was wanted in eight cases. They are accused in 21 cases registered in Kerala.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/anf-is-more-relevant-now-says-dgigp-praveen-sood/article37763551.ece
30 November 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Malavoor Vented Dam is out of bounds for people||The Dakshina Kannada Zilla Panchayat has made Malavoor Vented Dam across the Phalguni (Gurupura) off Airport Road out of bounds for the general public to ensure the safety of people as well as the source of drinking water to villages. Till recently, one could see the enthusiasts catching fish with their angles in the backwater as well as the water in the downstream standing on the vented dam as well as on the embankments. The vented dam also connected residents of Padushedde and other surrounding places on the southern bank with the Airport Road. The Zilla Panchayat has now erected an enclosure at the entrance of the vented dam on the northern bank near the pumphouse with gates that are kept locked. On the southern bank, the stock yard of Mugrodi Constructions acts as a barrier to enter the vented dam. When The Hindu visited the dam on Saturday, there was not a single soul engaged in angling and other activities. “The vented dam was not built to act as a bridge but purely to store drinking water under the multi-village drinking water scheme,” said Executive Engineer, Rural Drinking Water Supply, Zilla Panchayat, G. Narendra Babu. Movement of people was allowed till recently as there was no connectivity for villagers of Padushedde and surrounding villages to the Airport Road. With the recent completion of a road and a small bridge from Padushedde, people could easily reach the Airport Road at Marakada, he said. Public safety was a concern as the dam did not have any railings and there were every chance of mishaps happenning. There were chances of people removing the vent gates thereby draining out stored drinking water too. Some people used to indulge in partying near the dam and throwing trash into the backwater thereby polluting the drinking water source, Mr. Babu said. Though conceptualised in 2002 under the Rajiv Gandhi Drinking Water Scheme, work on the dam was completed in 2012-13. The dam was commissioned only in 2017. Completed at a cost of Rs. 42.5 crore, the 199-metre-long dam with 80 vents holds 1.25 million cubic metres of water. Treated water from the dam is being supplied to 14 surrounding villages, Bajpe, Jokatte, Malavoor, Kenjaru, Permude, Kuthethoor, Moodushedde, Padushedde, Tenka Yekkaru, Badaga Yekkaru, Bala, Kalavara, Soorinje and Delanthabettu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/malavoor-vented-dam-is-out-of-bounds-for-people/article37763544.ece

30 November 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||‘Give booster dose to frontline workers’||The former Health Minister U.T. Khader on Monday urged the State Government to provide booster dose to frontline workers immediately to fight against the new coronavirus variant. Addressing presspersons here, Mr. Khader, who is an MLA from Mangaluru, said that some countries have already started vaccinating their people with the third dose of the vaccine. He said that the government should take up a largescale drive to achieve 100% vaccination in Dakshina Kannada. About 90% of the eligible population in the district have been given the first dose and about 60% of the eligible population have received both the doses. He said that the government should be well prepared to prevent the spread of the new variant. It should not allow any such development that has the potential to create any panic among people. It should consider the new variant seriously. The MLA said that the government has not appointed any staff for maintaining medical oxygen generator units set up at various locations in the State. If employees are not appointed, such units will not be available for use due to lack of maintenance. The government should distribute tabs to laboratory technicians involved in swab tests as they have been using their personal mobile phones to upload the results of the swab tests. The government should sanction more funds to Dakshina Kannada to tackle the spread of COVID-19 as it shares its borders with Kerala and the number of travellers using the facility in the district to fly to foreign countries is high.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/give-booster-dose-to-frontline-workers/article37763547.ece
30 November 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Relief as no new strain of COVID-19 detected in Mysuru||The samples of Mysuru’s COVID-19 positive nursing students sent for genome sequencing have detected a regular COVID-19 strain and no new strain of the disease, bringing relief to the district administration and health authorities here, amidst the threat of a new variant of virus. Deputy Commissioner Bagadi Gautham on Monday clarified that no strain of Omicron has been detected in Mysuru and added that the district administration has taken all possible steps acting on the government instructions to step up surveillance on the inter-state border at Bavali. As many as 43 students of Cauvery Nursing College and 29 students of St. Joseph’s College of Nursing in Mysuru had tested positive. Out of 72 cases, only 21 were symptomatic and the rest were asymptomatic. However, all 72 students are stable in the cluster case. The Deputy Commissioner said 1,120 primary and secondary contacts of the infected nursing students have tested negative to the disease. They would again undergo RT-PCR test on the 7th day (from the day of test) as per the government norm. Negative report must Mr. Gautham clarified that those visiting the State from Kerala or Maharashtra have to compulsorily produce RT-PCR negative report not older than 72 hours. Also, those who have come to Mysuru from Kerala between November 12 and 27, will have to undergo RT-PCR test 15 days from the date of their entry. The health authorities have been told to conduct the tests, collecting the details of the returnees. Also, students from Kerala coming to Mysuru for studies have to undergo RT-PCR test on the 7th day of their return, irrespective of having the negative report on their arrival here. Testing targets up Amidst the fresh scare of pandemic in the wake of reports of Omicron strain of virus, the testing target in Mysuru has been increased from 3,000 to 5,000 a day. In the 5,000 daily tests, about 10 per cent of the samples will be of students, drawn randomly from colleges and schools, the DC said. He said the government has advised people to put off any government gatherings, events or cultural programmes as a precautionary measure. If necessary, they could be held virtually. Mr Bagadi said 160 vehicles from Kerala were denied entry into the State as they were not carrying valid RT-PCR negative reports. On an average, 20 to 25 positive cases were being detected since the last one-and-half months, Mr. Gautham said, arguing that the case load in Mysuru has not gone up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/relief-as-no-new-strain-of-covid-19-detected-in-mysuru/article37763572.ece
30 November 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Vaccine hesitancy seen in Mysuru||Vaccine hesitancy in Mysuru has become a worrying factor for the district administration as over two lakh people have skipped their second dose of vaccination for no reason after completing 84-day gap from the first dose. As many as one lakh people who are delaying their second dose are from Mysuru city alone. There used to be long queues before the vaccination centers here barely two months ago but now people are not ready to take their second dose even though the health workers are going to their doorsteps to vaccinate them. “It’s indeed worrying as people have become hesitant to vaccinate. I am urging them to become responsible and get themselves vaccinated soon for theirs and also for others’ safety,” said Deputy Commissioner Bagadi Gautham. Addressing a press conference here at his office on Monday, he said the pandemic situation is different now from what was there a few months ago in view of the new developments on the COVID-19 front, especially with the unearthing of new strains. “If you take the vaccine, it is good for the safety of your children and elders at home as chances of getting infected is less if one is fully vaccinated. In case of an infection, the severity will be less and the chances of fatality will be less in case of hospitalisation,” he explained. In Mysuru district, 63.64 per cent of people have got their second dose. “If the people cooperate, we could make it 100 per cent in the next two weeks as we have 3.85 lakh doses of vaccines and the health staff are fully geared up to step up vaccination.” Replying to a question, he said 5,000 beds are available in both government and private hospitals in the district for handling the situation. The hospital infrastructure has been upgraded to manage the situation with all taluk hospitals fully equipped with oxygen generation facilities. The pediatric infrastructure too has been scaled up with 200 oxygen beds, 38 ICU beds and 63 ICU beds with ventilators for the treatment. Mr Gautham said the vaccine hesitancy is not isolated to one area as it is spread across the district. Any issue with regard to non-availability of documents for vaccination can be resolved as the aim is to vaccinate the eligible populations. In any such case, the DHO can help to resolve the matter to ensure that none were denied vaccines for want of documents, he replied. MCC Commissioner Lakshmikanth Reddy, ZP CEO Yogesh, District Health Officer K.S. Prasad and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vaccine-hesitancy-seen-in-mysuru/article37763569.ece
30 November 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Resident doctors of MMCRI on strike||Resident doctors of Mysore Medical College and Research Institute (MMCRI) on Monday launched an indefinite strike, boycotting OPD services and all elective duties, including elective OTs barring emergency services, in support of their demands, which included payment of COVID-19 risk allowance and timely payment of stipend to postgraduates and interns. This is the third time the resident doctors are on strike here in support of their demands - second in the month of November this year. Their demands also included restructuring of academic fees as per the 2018-19 academic year. The protesting doctors said they had put off their strike earlier on the reported assurance from the Minister for Medical Education and Health that the issue of their demands would be resolved in 10 days. “However, our demands have not been addressed and therefore the agitation has been resumed until they are fulfilled,” they said. In a statement here, the Karnataka Association of Junior Doctors said it is unfortunate that the assurance given by the Minister has not been fulfilled. The intent to address the issue is clearly not visible as resident doctors were excluded from the package of COVID-19 risk allowance announced by the government a few months ago. They said their academic fee was increased from Rs. 30,000 to Rs. 1,20,000, which was a nearly 400 per cent hike. “To make matters worse during these troubling times, we have been made to pay up the entire sum without any concession. The issue was taken up in the form of symbolic protests, submission of petitions to the authorities concerned on a number of occasions. But there has been no response,” the association said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/resident-doctors-of-mmcri-on-strike/article37763566.ece
30 November 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||‘Cong. will win 15 seats in Council polls’||Former Chief Minister and Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leader Siddaramaiah on Monday expressed confidence that his party will win 15 seats in the ensuing Legislative Council polls from local authorities’ constituencies. Fielding reporters queries, Mr. Siddaramaiah said the support BJP had sought from JD(S) will not have any bearing on the Congress party’s prospects. “We will win 15 seats. We have fielded 20 candidates for the 25 seats and we will win 15 out of them”, he said. He said the BJP and JD(S) have had a hidden understanding in all elections and added that there was nothing new in former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa seeking the support of JD(S) now. When his attention was drawn to the anxiety over omicron, the new variant of COVID-19, Mr. Siddaramaiah said the State Government should take all steps necessary to prevent the entry of the strain into the State. Surveillance should be stepped at the airports, bus stands, railway stations and borders. “It is the government’s responsibility to prevent the entry of the new strain into the State.” He sought to caution the government against neglecting the threat and claimed that a lot of people had died during the second wave due to the ‘negligence’ by government. He claimed that people had died due to non-availability of oxygen beds and medicine. “It should not happen again. The government should screen all the people entering the State properly”, he said. He also criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for remaining absent at the all-party meeting convened ahead of the winter session of Parliament. “He has shown disrespect to democracy by keeping himself away it”, he said. Referring to Mr. Modi’s statement that he had become the Prime Minister to serve the public, Mr. Siddaramaiah wondered what is new in it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cong-will-win-15-seats-in-council-polls/article37763570.ece

Eshwarappa’s reported intervention to stall punitive action against shopkeepers selling cigarettes in violation of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA) guidelines in Shivamogga, the Anti-Tobacco Forum (ATF) has urged authorities to hold a workshop to create awareness of the tobacco control laws among Ministers, MLAs, MPs and other people’s representatives “It is unfortunate and conflicting that Mr. Eshwarappa, a senior politician, has interfered with the police officials, who were carrying out lawful enforcement of tobacco control rules and regulations of COTPA in Shivamogga. It is not clear whether the Minister is aware of COTPA and WHO’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) protocol guidelines”, said ATF convenor Vasanthkumar Mysoremath. Pointing out that COTPA had empowered officers of more than 25 Government departments , to conduct raids on shops selling tobacco products in violation of rules laid down in COTPA, Mr. Mysoremath urged the High Power Committee on State Tobacco Control to conduct an awareness workshop on COTPA and FCTC protocol for the people’s representatives. The Committee headed by the Chief Secretary should invite Ministers, MPs and MLAs to attend the workshop so that they can keep themselves abreast of the legal provisions of COTPA and the health hazards of tobacco consumption so that such embarrassing and conflicting situations do not arise in future, Mr. Mysoremath said. He was reacting to Mr. Eshwarappa’s reported warning to the police for taking action against the shopkeepers, who were selling cigarettes in violation of COTPA guidelines. Section 6 of COTPA prohibits sale of cigarettes or other tobacco products not only in an area within a radius of 100 yards from any educational institution, but also to any person below the age of 18 years. Section 4 of COTPA also prohibits smoking in public places.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/anti-tobacco-forum-joins-issue-with-eshwarappa/article37763573.ece

The deceased was identified as Siddaraju.

In a statement issued here after the meeting held in Thiruvananthapuram on Monday, P.P. Chitharanjan, MLA, said that a 1,200-metre pipeline at Thakazhi would be replaced on a war footing. Inordinate delay Mr. Chitharanjan said the Ambalappuzha-Thiruvalla road, which would be dug up for carrying out the work, would be restored simultaneously. The move to replace the defective pipeline comes after an inordinate delay. Although a high-level meeting convened by then Water Resources Minister K. Krishnankutty in November 2019 had decided to replace the pipeline in three months, the work never took off due to various reasons. Multiple pipe bursts The Alappuzha drinking water project was executed by the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) with Central assistance under the Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and Medium Towns (UIDSSMT) in 2017. However, since its launch, pipelines under the project have burst more than 60 times, majority of them at Thakazhi, in the past four years, disrupting the water supply to residents in Alappuzha municipality and eight nearby grama panchayats, along with damaging the Ambalapuzha-Thiruvalla road.

30 November 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Marine Drive extension: special package for landowners||The first phase of the proposed Marine Drive extension project will witness the extension of Queen’s Walkway to Vaduthala till the container railway terminal line. The project will also witness the development of 42.49 hectares in the region, according to the project document. The preliminary project report, which was prepared by the Consultancy Service Unit of the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), has proposed a compensation package for landowners. It will include compensation for the holding to be acquired at market rate and built-up space equivalent to the extent of the holding which may have to be acquired. For instance, once the plot of a landowner, who holds a 240-square-metre-wide plot, is acquired, he will get the land value for 240 square metres, besides a built-up space of 240 square metres, the document explained. It is estimated that 34.71 hectares will have to be acquired in the first phase of the project. The land acquisition cost has been estimated at Rs. 857.8 crore in the first phase. Land acquisition for creating a mangrove forest in the project area will require Rs. 100 crore, which will primarily be used for acquiring islands in the project area to develop the mangrove forest. Interestingly, the mangrove forest will offset environmental degradation that may occur during the construction of the project, according to the document. It is estimated that construction activity during the first phase will cost Rs. 5,312 crore, infrastructure development Rs. 198.9 crore, and rental for rehabilitation component Rs. 100.8 crore. The project proposes to extend Marine Drive to Vaduthala. It will also cover Mulavukad and Cheranalloor. Cost modelling The project document explains the execution of the project in a phased manner, with each phase generating surplus revenue. The revenue thus generated will be used as the seed fund for the next phase. The first phase will require a capital fund, which will have to be supplied to the special purpose vehicle to be formed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/marine-drive-extension-special-package-for-landowners/article37763467.ece
30 November 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Proliferation of African snails triggers unease in coastal areas||The proliferation of giant African snails seems to have yet again triggered concerns over crop infestations and public health in Ernakulam. The problem seems particularly worse in coastal panchayats like Nayarambalam and Njarakkal. “We have approached the Agriculture Department seeking steps to control them, especially on abandoned plots within the panchayat limits,” said Neethu Binod, Nayarambalam panchayat president. The department keeps getting a steady stream of complaints about crop infestations by African snails. “The absence of an appropriate chemical specifically targeting them remains another challenge,” said Mary Shilpa, District Agriculture Officer. Though the department had in the past recommended a chemical, it was later abandoned, as it was found highly toxic, especially in aquatic systems. Pouring salt and saline solutions has emerged as the most commonly adopted ploy to eliminate African snails. “We recommend farmers to stack fruit and vegetable leaves in wet sacks, as snails get drawn to them in numbers by the smell, making it easier for their mass elimination. They infest almost all crops with soft parts and also walls, as the calcium presence help them create their shells,” said Sheethal Babu Paul, Agriculture Officer, Elamkunnapuzha. T.V. Sajeev, senior principal scientist with the Kerala Forest Research Institute, drew attention to public health concerns raised by the proliferation of African snails. “Being the host of parasitic nematode, they can trigger diseases like cerebral meningitis on coming into contact with them with bare hands,” he said. He added that local bodies had a major role in controlling infestation, since they alone can intervene in spaces considered no-man’s land and which offer the perfect setting for their proliferation. The infested areas should be demarcated and control measures applied. “Being hermaphrodites, African snails reproduce at a rapid pace. They remain underground during summer season giving the false impression that their invasion is over only for them to emerge en masse with the rains,” said Mr. Sajeev. Timber imports centred around Willingdon island in 2015-16 are believed to have carried African snails here.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/proliferation-of-african-snails-triggers-unease-in-coastal-areas/article37763470.ece
30 November 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Monson case: Govt. opposes ED’s proposal for CBI probe||A statement of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) before the Kerala High Court that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) may have to step in for probing the cases against fake antiquities dealer Monson Mavunkal should be viewed as a motivated one, according to a statement filed by the State Government before the High Court on Monday. Opposing the ED’s stance, the Government submitted that “the entry of the ED in the present case and its overenthusiasm shown through its counsel to bring the CBI, which has no role either legally or factually in the allegation made by the petitioner, in the picture cannot be viewed lightly”. The ED’s counsel had earlier submitted before the court that the agency could conduct a probe only into the financial trail of the alleged scam perpetrated by Monson. In fact, the CBI may have to step in to probe the other offences committed by him. The submissions were made when a petition filed by the former driver of Monson alleging police harassment had come up for hearing. The “posture” of the ED in the recent past had been against the basic tenets of the federal system, which was an inalienable part of the basic structure of the Constitution, added the State Government. ‘Unnecessary’ The Government pointed out that the cases against Monson related to cheating and allied offences raised by private parties, who had not raised any objection regarding the investigation by the police. Therefore, the submission of the ED was unnecessary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/monson-case-govt-opposes-eds-proposal-for-cbi-probe/article37763510.ece

Commission chairman M.R. Hariharan Nair had written to the NSS that if it had apprehensions about the quality of the commission’s sample survey to identify the socio-economic issues faced by forward communities, it could depute its volunteers from Karayogams to carry out the survey and the data would be considered while preparing the commission’s recommendations. Many forward community organisations have embarked on the exercise. ‘Unscientific survey’ Responding to the letter, NSS general secretary G. Sukumaran Nair said the organisation would not cooperate with the “unscientific survey and collection of data.” There is no change in the NSS’ opposition to the procedure adopted by the panel. If the panel goes ahead with its sample survey, the NSS will be forced to seek redress for its grievances. Legal challenge The decision of the panel, if required, will be challenged legally, Mr. Sukumaran Nair said. He expressed apprehension that the data generated from an “unscientific exercise” would remain in the records for ever and could hurt the interests of the community. The organisation had earlier submitted a document on the socio-economic conditions of the community to the panel. The NSS general secretary had petitioned the Chief Minister to stop the survey as he felt that the methodology to be employed could lead to the denial of due rights to the economically weaker sections among the forward communities. Of each community He had pointed out that a report submitted by former commission chairman A.V. Ramakrishna Pillai had recommended the socio, economic, and community surveys of each community and their population recorded. While concurring with the demand of the NSS for an exhaustive survey, Mr. Hariharan Nair pointed out that the State Government had not yielded to a similar suggestion from Mr. Pillai. Training completed The sample survey would cover at least 97,445 houses at the rate of five families from each of the 19,489 local body wards in the State. The training for the master trainers has been completed. The trained survey staff will fan out across the State from December 5 for data collection, sources pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nss-rejects-commissions-offer-on-socio-economic-survey/article37763512.ece

Heaps of non-biodegradable waste remain at the waste collection yard of the civic body in North Kalamassery. Waste segregation and disposal were hit after the person, who had received the sub-contract from the firm chosen to handle waste, alleged that he was yet to receive a major share of the payment. The incinerator for burning plastic materials is facing glitches. The roof over the incinerator may collapse any time thanks to lack of maintenance and repair. Inspections by agencies, including the State Pollution Control Board (PCB), had found that waste heaps that should be burnt in the incinerator had been kept in the open. Incineration of waste has been hit owing to this shortcoming, as waste kept in the open turned wet in heavy rains. The council has not been able to find a comprehensive solution to the vexed issue despite repeated warnings and stringent directives from the State Level Monitoring Committee on Solid Waste Management. The health standing committee has been entrusted with the task of coming up with solutions to ensure proper segregation and disposal of non-biodegradable waste, according to the authorities. The local body was slapped with a penalty of Rs. 2.77 crore as environment compensation for failure to comply with the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. According to the PCB, only one-fifth of waste generated in the municipality has been disposed. A major quantity of biodegradable waste is transported to the Kochi Corporation’s dumping yard at Brahmapuram. The notice issued by the board had said that the authorities had failed to ensure bioremediation or capping of old and abandoned dumping yards. They should have identified suitable sites for setting up solid waste processing facilities, according to the board.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/unscientific-waste-handling-continues-in-kalamassery/article37763474.ece

The housewife from Aluva had Googled for the number while looking for a potential offer for smart television during Deepavali. She came across a fake number, which was made to look like that of a popular e-commerce giant. When contacted, fraudsters convinced her that there was indeed an offer for smart television and asked her to fill a form embedded in a link sent to her. She then received the link appearing to be an authentic one from the e-commerce giant. She was asked to furnish details, including her bank account number and UPI id, and the woman duly complied. She then received a text message, which she was asked to send to a certain mobile number. Once she complied, fraudsters reportedly seized control of her bank account. They then made three withdrawals of Rs. 25,000 each and another account transfer of Rs. 2,000. Realising her folly, the woman lodged a complaint with the District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural). Subsequently, a special squad of the cyber police station launched a probe. It emerged that fraudsters had bought gift vouchers for Rs. 50,000 from e-commerce portals and made another purchase for Rs. 25,000. The investigation team acted swiftly and got the bank account transactions made by fraudsters frozen. Shortly thereafter, the money was credited back to the petitioner’s bank account much to her relief. A north India-based racket was found to be behind the fraud, the police said. “Internet users should be careful while searching for contact numbers online and verify the numbers before engaging with the parties,” said District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) K. Karthik.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/police-help-woman-regain-money-lost-to-fraud/article37763468.ece

Abraham Varghese, managing director of the Kottayam port, and Anit Peter, managing partner, Azimar, signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) in this regard at a function held in the presence of Industries Minister P. Rajeeve and Registrations Minister V. N. Vasavan in Thiruvananthapuram on Monday. As per this, Azimar will invest in building a new barge with a capacity to carry 30 TEU (twenty-foot equivalent unit) of cargo. The move comes as earlier attempts by the Kottayam port authority to build a new barge fell flat in view of fund crunch. “At present, we have more than 400 units of container transactions per month. With the arrival of Azimar, we expect that to cross 600 units in the beginning and touch 1,000 units later,” said Roopesh Kumar, general manager, Kottayam port. Presently, the ICD runs its operations using a barge with a capacity of 10 TEU. The new barge is expected to be operational in six months. The ICD authorities expect the procedural formalities to elevate the dry port into a minor Customs Port to complete in the meantime, which will give a major boost to inland water movement of cargo. Boost to logistics Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Vasavan said the logistics sector in the State would receive a major boost with the full-scale movement of cargo through the Kottayam port. Industries Minister P. Rajeeve said arrival of more foreign investments to the State would encourage the ‘work from Kerala’ initiative.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kottayam-port-in-expansion-mode/article37763501.ece

Mani has received a major shot in the arm by wresting control of the Pala-based Meenachil Cooperative Agricultural & Rural Development Bank from the rival camp. In an election for the 13 seats in the bank’s governing council held on Sunday, the party won 10 seats, while the CPI(M), its key ally in the Left Democratic Front (LDF), secured two seats. The lone remaining seat went to the CPI, also a constituent of the LDF. Shift of faction The election to the council, where the United Democratic Front (UDF) had held sway for 28 years till November last year, was necessitated by the KC(M)’s shift to the Left coalition. Of the 13 members in the previous governing council, which had assumed charge in February 2019, seven who owed allegiance to the KC(M) resigned en masse from their posts in November last year. The shock move, initiated as a mark of protest against a decision by the bank’s president and party leader E.J. Augusthy to join the P.J. Joseph faction of the KC(M), put the bank under an administrative committee’s rule. The bank, established in 1965, has 10,366 shareholders. Low turn-out The LDF also romped home in a keenly fought election to the administrative council of the Thiruvalla East Cooperative Bank. Each of the 13 candidates fielded by the Left front won by a margin of over 1,000 votes in an election in which only 8,094 out of the 58,440 eligible voters exercised their franchise. The election, held across 30 booths in 12 panchayats under tight police security on Sunday, had seen the LDF and the UDF locking horns in a direct battle. The bank had been under the control of the UDF for the past 15 years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ldf-wins-elections-to-coop-councils/article37763499.ece

He told the media on Monday that those found positive would be isolated and others who are negative would be quarantined for a week. Positive patients would be tested again after eight days and if they are found to be negative, they would have to be isolated for another week. If the positive patients turn out to test positive again, they would be put in institutional quarantine. Another test would be conducted on the 14th day again. Body fluid samples of infected persons would be sent for genome sequencing to the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnlogy, Thiruvananthapuram. The screening at the airport is done by the DMO office, Malappuram. Dr. Farooq said that the Health Department in Kozhikode was also intensifying the vaccination campaign. Of the 24.99 lakh targeted population who are aged 18 or above, 23.78 lakh had taken the first dose, a coverage of 95.15%. As many as 14.52 lakh people have taken both the doses, and the coverage is 61.08%, he said. Asked about the unvaccinated population, Dr. Farooq said that some people had cited health issues and religious beliefs for not taking the jab. There had been a delay in releasing the results of the RT-PCR tests in the district because of the staff shortage in designated labs. Those vacant posts had been filled and the results would soon be available. Steps are being taken to restart mobile vaccination units as well, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/screening-of-international-passengers-begins-at-airport/article37763455.ece

This was quite unexpected,” said Derrick Paul, a volunteer of CARE, who was overseeing the adoption process. “There were many takers for the street dogs, some of them were brought from the Animal Birth Control Centre of the Corporation while we had brought some too,” he said. Some people even brought puppies from the street with them and handed them over to the organisers on the spot. “They brought the puppies in cardboard boxes and as soon as the boxes were opened, some were booked by participants,” said Mr. Paul. The animals were handed over to the new owners after being vaccinated. The ownership certificates will be issued later. However, some dogs that did not look healthy, especially those with bite marks on them, had fewer takers. “It is about the mindset of the people. Even these puppies will look healthy and cute if they are properly taken care of for a week or two. They have better immunity than the higher breed dogs and half the care people give to higher breeds can do wonders to these street puppies,” said Mr. Paul. Similarly, there were fewer takers for female puppies. The organisers said people did not want them as there were chances of them getting pregnant. “This is a problem that can be avoided if the Corporation assured them of free sterilisation of the adopted puppies after six months,” added Mr. Paul. Mayor Beena Philip, health standing committee chairperson S. Jayasree and other councillors visited the camp. The camp is the brain child of Corporation Veterinary Officer V.S.

But the common symptoms would be joint pain, headache, neck pain and back pain. It is more dangerous and the mortality rate is higher, the message claimed.

With the formation of the Congress Unit Committee (CUC), the party would make a strong impact at the grassroots-level. He said organisational elections would be held in a time-bound manner. Leaders were not dissatisfied with the semi-cadre system. So far, no one had objected to the proposed system of functioning of the party, he added. Mr. Anwar said no dispute had cropped up between the senior leaders and the current leadership. He said he had no idea why former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy and former Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Ramesh Chennithala had stayed away from the meeting of the UDF held in Thiruvananthapuram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cong-firm-on-rejigging-party-apparatus-in-state/article37763505.ece
30 November 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||800-MW new power station feasible in Idukki: study||An 800-MW power station can be established in Idukki to complement the existing 780-MW power-generation facility, a pre-feasibility study prepared by WAPCOS, a Central Government agency, has indicated. The project, which will take the combined installed capacity of the Idukki hydroelectric power project to 1,580 MW, is designed to address the long-term power demands of the State. The Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) hopes to begin work on the Idukki Golden Jubilee Extension Scheme, estimated to cost Rs. 2,669.67 crore, in 2023 and complete it in five years. As per the pre-feasibility report, the civil work is estimated to cost Rs. 1,309.67 crore and electromechanical work, Rs. 1,360 crore. Minister for Electricity K. Krishnankutty accepted the pre-feasibility report, prepared by WAPCOS, from the KSEB here on Monday. The project, along with the Soura rooftop solar plant initiative, would be a critical component in addressing the power requirements of the State for the next 30 years, KSEB chairman and managing director B. Ashok said. At Moolamattom Planned at Moolamattom, 500 m north of the existing underground station, the proposed power station will draw water from the Idukki reservoir. The intake structure is planned on the left bank of the Kulamavu dam. A new penstock pipe will be laid from the reservoir for carrying water to the station, which too is planned as an underground facility. The tail-race water will be released into the Thodupuzha river in the Muvattupuzha basin. Four generators The station will be equipped with four generators having a capacity of 200 MW each. In due course, the old station with six generators, commissioned in 1976, would be kept as a standby, KSEB officials said. The extension scheme has been necessitated by the fact that the evening peak demand (6.30 p.m. to 10.30 p.m.) in the State has risen to 3,966 MW and the morning peak to 3,200 MW. Clearances needed The KSEB needs to obtain nine crucial clearances before it can move forward with the project. It expects to apply for clearance from the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests in January 2022. The detailed project report and the environment impact assessment report are expected in September 2022. The bid documents will be ready by November 2022. Environment clearance is expected at the earliest by March 2023.  A pre-feasibility study by WAPCOS, a Central Government agency, puts the total cost at Rs. 2,669.67 crore||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/800-mw-new-power-station-feasible-in-idukki-study/article37763516.ece

Temporary pre-fabricated steel structures will be used to construct the rehabilitation blocks. According to officials of the city Corporation’s Smart City project, under which the redevelopment project is being implemented, the work on the blocks are expected to be completed within eight months. The construction of the rehabilitation block is being done on the land under the Thiruvananthapuram Development Authority (TRIDA). Out of the more than one acre of land, 40 cents of land used to be a waste dump behind the market and was reclaimed last year through an intensive bio-mining process. The 40 cents of land thus reclaimed and the 62 cents of vacant land adjacent to it are being used for the construction of the rehabilitation block for close to 500 traders who will be displaced during the construction activities of Palayam Market. Fifty shops under TRIDA will be given permanent shops in the vacant M Block. Traders convinced The Corporation, Smart City officials, and people’s representatives had to organise meetings with the traders recently to convince them to relocate to the rehabilitation blocks. The existing cramped spaces will be replaced by a multi-level complex, which will also include parking spaces and extra commercial spaces. The development activities will be carried out within the market area by retaining the 19th century arched gate, which is considered as one of the heritage monuments of the city. TRIDA and Corpn. The land within the market area is partly owned by the city Corporation and partly by the Thiruvananthapuram Development Authority (TRIDA). The development works under the Smart City project will be carried out mostly on the land owned by the civic body. The project pegged at around Rs. 100 crore will consist of a three floor complex and two additional floors underground for parking. The existing shops, including the fish and vegetable vending markets, will mostly be accommodated on the first floor of the complex. The second and third floors are meant to accommodate the new shops.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/work-on-connemara-rehab-blocks-begins/article37763630.ece
30 November 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Chandy, Ramesh bunk UDF meet||A routine United Democratic Front (UDF) meeting appeared to accumulate adverse media attention on Monday with two top Congress leaders “staying away” from the Opposition conclave. Oommen Chandy and Ramesh Chennithala, who heads the well-entrenched ‘A’ and ‘I’ factions in the Congress in the State respectively, triggered television news scrolls and commentariat by their absence at the conference held at Cantonment House, the official residence of Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan. It also did not seem to help the party that Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president K. Sudhakaran was also away. By one account, coalition partners were reportedly disquieted by the prospect of a resurgence of feuding in the Congress at the cusp of a massive grassroots-level campaign planned against K-Rail. Mr. Chandy and Mr. Chennithala were reportedly disgruntled for some time over the All India Congress Committee’s decision to allow the KPCC leadership to “restructure the party at will” ahead of organisational polls in April 2022. They felt the move would allow the incumbent powers in the Congress to control the membership drive and stack the decks in their favour ahead of the polls. The factions protested against Mr. Sudhakaran’s “skewed” application of the party rule book to eject workers perceived to be inimical to the KPCC leadership. Certain party insiders said the absence of the leaders at the UDF conclave was no act of protest. There was no pressing agenda, and many UDF leaders were in New Delhi. However, the subsequent reactions of UDF convener M.M. Hassan and AICC general secretary Tariq Anwar seemed to belie their claim. Mr. Hassan said somewhat cryptically that the onus was on Mr. Chandy and Mr. Chennithala to explain why they did not attend the UDF conclave. Mr. Anwar told reporters in Kannur that he would speak to the leaders and smoothen out any issues. Protest season Mr. Hassan later said the UDF would muster people displaced by the K-Rail project and march to the Secretariat on November 18. The UDF would organise resistance to the semi-high-speed railway at the neighbourhood level in 11 districts of the State. On December 6, a UDF delegation headed by Mr. Satheesan would visit Attappady to investigate the worrying infant deaths.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/chandy-chennithala-stay-away-from-udf-meeting/article37763459.ece

The sector should turn more efficient and stronger to effectively combat such attempts, the Chief Minister said, inaugurating the Vidyanidhi deposit scheme for children launched by the Kerala Bank. Attempts to weaken the sector did not reflect a healthy trend. The sector had been able to survive similar attempts in the past, Mr. Vijayan said, calling for robust defensive measures, especially on the part of the Kerala Bank. Forces that target the Kerala Bank would first aim for the cooperative sector, he said. There were numerous primary banks and urban banks affiliated to the Kerala Bank in the State, Mr. Vijayan said. Certain sections were now insisting that the primary banks should be referred to as primary agricultural cooperative societies. But it should not be forgotten that it was the primary banks that created banking literacy in the State, he said. Teaching children to lead a good life was more important than inculcating saving habits in them, the Chief Minister said. Minister for Cooperation V.N. Vasavan, who presided, said the State Government had the power to protect the cooperative sector. The contents of the recent statement issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) pertaining to the sector was baseless and misleading, Mr. Vasavan said. The State Government intended to approach the court for a solution, he said. Children in Classes 7 to 10 could open savings bank accounts in Kerala Bank under the Vidyanidhi scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vidyanidhi-scheme-for-children-launched/article37763508.ece
30 November 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||CM hails pro-women stance of films||Lauding the Kerala State Film Award jury for choosing films with a pro-women stance for this year’s awards, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the films laid stress on the need for democratisation within families. He was speaking at the award presentation ceremony held at the Nishagandhi auditorium here on Monday. “Cinema is a medium which has the most influence on the public. It is notable that both the films that won the awards for the best film and the second best film uphold a pro-women stance and advocate women’s right for self-determination. The Great Indian Kitchen exposes how patriarchy works silently within families without any overt act of violence. Democracy is not just a political system, but it is something that needs to be implemented within families too. The jury, by choosing these films, was thus able to capture the transformation happening in Malayalam cinema,” he said. Active during pandemic He said it was heartening that the Malayalam film industry continued to be active even during the COVID-19 pandemic period. As many as 100 films were censored during the year 2020, out of which 80 films were submitted for the awards. Among the submissions, 38 films were made by directors making their debut. 48 awards presented Mr. Vijayan presented 48 awards, including those for best actors Jayasurya and Anna Ben, and director Sidhartha Siva and Geo Baby, the director of the Best Film. Siji Sachy, wife of director Sachy, who passed away last year, received the award for the Best Film with Popular Appeal and Aesthetic Value for Ayyappanum Koshiyum on his behalf. Minister for Cultural Affairs Saji Cherian presided over the function. Industries Minister P. Rajeeve released a book detailing the awards for the year by presenting a copy to Agriculture Minister P.

30 November 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Scheme faces many technical challenges||The Idukki Golden Jubilee Extension Scheme, which envisages a new 800-MW power station in Idukki, is designed to have minimal impact on the environment, according to the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB). The scheme also offers some complex technical challenges. Much of the civil construction, including the power station, will be positioned underground with minimal disturbance to the forestland above. The tail-race water, after power generation, would be let out into the Thodupuzha river, the same as the existing 780-MW power station, KSEB officials said. An important question pertains to whether the Thodupuzha river and the Malankara dam can accommodate the tail water. A KSEB official said the pre-feasibility study by WAPCOS showed that they could. One option is the construction of a balancing pool/reservoir downstream to hold the outflow, but this would require additional land. A second engineering challenge is the construction of the actual structures, the majority of which, including the 800-MW power station, will be positioned underground, according to the pre-feasibility study. The powerhouse, which will be equipped with four 200 MW generators, also is to be housed in an underground cavern. The project also required 16 hectares of private land for the construction of the switch yard and transmission facilities, the KSEB officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/scheme-faces-many-technical-challenges/article37763517.ece

Mohamed Riyas has said the repair of the pothole-ridden Pazhakutty–Mangalapuram road will soon get under way. Top priority will be given for developing a proper drainage system along the stretch to prevent further damage. Mr. Riyas, who inspected the dilapidated road to take stock of motorists’ woes on Monday, said the State exchequer had incurred a large expense during the last 10 years by way of repair works undertaken on the 20-km stretch. The Public Works Department (PWD) entered into an agreement for its development on October 28. The entire stretch would be developed as two reaches, the first of which would be 7-km-long to be developed by December 2022. Defect liability As part of enforcing defect liability periods (DLP), the department would set up information boards on the 2,500-odd roads in the State on December 3 to display the contact details of contractors and officials concerned. The move would pave the way for public intervention and accountability to ensure roads were well-maintained during the DLPs. Running contracts would be prepared for roads having expired DLPs, he added. Mr. Riyas said the Government would undertake the repair of damaged roads as soon as the rain eased off. Administrative sanction had been granted for Rs. 119 crore earmarked for the purpose. The Road Maintenance and Vigilance wings of the PWD would oversee the quality of the maintenance works.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pazhakutty-mangalapuram-road-will-be-developed-says-riyas/article37763626.ece

The inflows into the reservoir, which has a capacity to store 5.3 tmcft, had touched 5.1 tmcft on Sunday evening. There was an inflow of 2,470 cusecs, forcing the Irrigation Department officials to allow water into the Penna river through the spillway. There was a festive atmosphere as people thronged the dam site in large numbers. Currently, two gates have been lifted. With rain still continuing in Karnataka, there was continuous flow into the river. The PABR is the main source of drinking water for Anantapur city and 150 villages in the district. Superintendent Engineer Irrigation (HLC and HNSS) Nayakanti Rajasekhar told The Hindu that by Monday morning, the power generation unit was utilising 500 cusecs and another 1,070 cusecs were being released through two gates into the spillway. “The reservoir has a capacity of 11 tmcft, but land acquisition for submergence had been done only up to 5.3 tmcft. This was the highest ever stored in the reservoir since its construction,” Mr. Rajasekhar explained. Another 2,400 acres need to be acquired and geomembrane lining has to be done to store water to its capacity in the PABR, he added. Now, 2,470 cusecs of water was coming from the Upper Penna Project, which also filled to the brim for the first time after 20 years. The Mid Pennar Project downstream was also brimming at 4.7 tmcft and about 4,000 cusecs was being released through spillway and canals. Further downstream was Chagallu Reservoir, which was full and gates lifted releasing 500 cusecs and from there water flows into Gandikota and finally into Mylavaram Reservoir in Kadapa district. Another dam that was about to brim in the district was the Bhairavani Tippa Project with a current level of 1.44 tmcft against 2 tmcft capacity on Hagari river.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/pabr-dam-gates-lifted-for-first-time-after-construction/article37763155.ece

Vivekananda Reddy’s daughter), as they allegedly wanted him to give a false affidavit before a magistrate under Section 164 in the murder case on Tuesday. When contacted, Mr. Fakkeerappa said he had received a complaint from Mr. Gangadhar Reddy and that he had constituted an inquiry by a Deputy Superintendent of Police to verify the facts of his claims in the complaint and submit a report within five days. “We will give Gangadhar Reddy some protection till things become clear,” the SP added. Speakinag to mediapersons, Mr. Gangadhar, quoting his complaint to the SP, alleged that he was asked by the CBI officials and the Circle Inspector through WhatsApp calls on October 4 and November 24 to sign a false affidavit alleging that “Sankar Reddy, Bhaskar Reddy, and Avinash Reddy got Vivekananda Reddy murdered” and for that he was offered Rs. 10 lakh. “I chose not to give such a statement and since then I am getting threatening calls,” he alleged. He submitted to the SP the screenshots of the WhatsApp calls allegedly made by the CBI officer and the Circle Inspector. He claimed he was a staunch follower of Sankar Reddy while he studied in Pulivendula and later shifted to Yadiki 12 years ago, hence he was being harassed. “I was questioned by the SIT officials in 2019 10 days after the murder and later the CBI officials gave a script also as to what I should say in the affidavit in the court, which even contained a concocted story in which I am supposed to say that I was offered Rs. 10 crore by Sankar Reddy for the murder of Vivekananda Reddy,” he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/man-alleges-threat-from-cbi-in-viveka-murder-case/article37763159.ece
30 November 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Karnataka sends samples of South African visitor to ICMR||Amid growing concern over the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, Karnataka Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar on Monday said the sample of one of two South African travellers who had tested COVID-19 positive recently in Bengaluru has features of a variant that is “different from the Delta variant.” The Minister said he was in touch with the Union Health Ministry and the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) on this. “One of the samples of a 63-year-old man is found to be Delta while the other is different. We have sought ICMR’s assistance in ascertaining the variant. The report is expected by Tuesday,” the Minister said. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai also said the State is awaiting confirmation from ICMR. Contrary claims Both the State Health and BBMP officials had said on Friday that two travellers were infected and both had tested positive for Delta variant. However, on Monday, following the Minister’s statement, K.V. Trilok Chandra, BBMP Special Commissioner (Health), said the samples had been resent to the NCBS Genome Sequencing lab for reconfirmation. “There will be some clarity after we get the report on Tuesday,” he said. Confusion State Health Commissioner D. Randeep said there was some confusion as the two travellers had tested positive on different dates. While the sample of the person who arrived on November 11 was sequenced and found to be infected with Delta, the other sample was sent to the NCBS only on November 27. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai made it clear on Monday that there was no proposal before the State Government to impose a lockdown now. He further clarified that authorities had been told to keep vigil on schools and colleges, but not close them. Don’t panic, says CM Speaking to the media in Davangere, Mr. Bommai asked people not to panic over the new variant, but follow COVID-19 protocol. He said the Government would be maintaining a strict vigil over people visiting India from countries where the new variant was found, and contact tracing was being carried out. “We are conducting tests at airports and only those with COVID-19 negative report are being allowed to enter Bengaluru. Only those students from Kerala who have a negative report should be allowed,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/samples-of-s-african-visitor-sent-to-icmr/article37763142.ece
30 November 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Bodies of 2 COVID victims found in mortuary after a year||In a shocking incident, the decomposed bodies of two COVID-19 patients, who died of the virus during the first wave in 2020, were found in the mortuary of ESIC Model Hospital in Rajajinagar. The bodies were recovered on Friday evening, at the cold storage when the housekeeping staff went there for cleaning. The families of the victims, who were earlier told that the bodies were cremated, are stunned at the turn of events. They were informed by the police about the bodies still being in the mortuary. Sources in the hospital said the bodies were identified as Durga S., 40, a resident of Chamarajpet, and Muniraju, 35, a resident of KP Agrahara in Bengaluru, with the help of tags. They were admitted to the ESIC Model hospital for COVID-19 treatment in July 2020. After their death, their bodies were shifted to the mortuary to be handed over to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) for cremation. As per COVID-19 protocols then, the civic body had the responsibility of cremating the bodies of the victims and the bodies were not given to the families. The mortuary at the hospital has six cold storages for storing dead bodies. However, during the spike in COVID-19 deaths, the cold storage facility was not enough to handle the load. Hence, a new mortuary with storage facilities for 10 bodies was constructed. Sources in the hospital said the two bodies were “forgotten” in the old mortuary as the hospital authorities were under the impression that the BBMP personnel had taken away the bodies. When the new mortuary started functioning in December 2020, the old facility was not used much as there were not many deaths, sources said. “The fact that two bodies were lying in the freezers came to light only after the housekeeping staff opened the freezers following a foul smell,” sources said. When contacted, V. Vijayanath, Head of the Department of Forensic Medicine at ESI Hospital, refused to comment. However, Hospital Dean and Director Jithendra Kumar said he has ordered an internal enquiry. “There seems to have been a problem with the handing over of the bodies to the BBMP, as the mortuary log book shows that the bodies had been handed over,” the doctor said. “The bodies have now been handed over to the police and the families of both the deceased were called to the Rajajinagar Police station on Monday afternoon to collect them for disposal,” he said. Anil Kumar Sahu, ESI Regional Director, Karnataka, said he will get the matter thoroughly investigated. This “negligence” has evoked sharp criticism. A group of organisations came together and staged a protest in front of the hospital on Monday. Ms. Durga’s younger brother Madhusudan B. and sister Sujatha G.B., who are now taking care of her two daughters (aged 11 and 15 ), said her body was not handed over to them as per the guidelines. “Our houses were sealed and the BBMP personnel even called us up to inform us that our sister’s body was cremated. We believed them and performed all the rituals. We were shocked when the police told us that her body is still in the mortuary,” Mr. Madhusudan told The Hindu . Ms. Durga’s husband had died earlier. A family member of Mr. Muniraju blamed the hospital and the BBMP for the fiasco. “How could they not notice that bodies were lying in the mortuary for 15 months? This is shocking,” a family member said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bodies-of-2-covid-19-victims-found-in-mortuary-after-a-year/article37763100.ece
30 November 2021||CHENNAI,ANDHRA PRADESH||SC to hear Rajiv assassination convicts case on December 7||A case relating to the premature release of seven convicts undergoing life imprisonment for the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi is expected to be listed before the Supreme Court on December 7, the Tamil Nadu Government informed the Madras High Court on Monday. Appearing before the first Division Bench of Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu, Advocate-General R. Shunmugasundaram said the case was filed by A.G. Perarivalan, one of the convicts, in 2016. At the hearing of the case last year, the Supreme Court wanted to know the status of a recommendation made by the State Cabinet to the Governor on September 9, 2018, to release all the convicts by exercising power under Article 161 of the Constitution. In reply, the State Government on November 3, 2020, informed the Supreme Court that the Governor was waiting for the final report of the Multi Disciplinary Monitoring Agency (MDMA), which had been constituted to probe the wider conspiracy behind the assassination, before taking a decision. At the subsequent hearing on January 21 this year, the Solicitor-General informed the Supreme Court that the Governor would take a decision on a remittance petition filed by Perarivalan, under Article 161 of the Constitution, within a week and apprise the court of the development. On February 4, the Union Home Ministry filed an affidavit that the Governor considered all facts on records and after perusal of the relevant documents, he had on January 25 decided that the President would be the appropriate authority to deal with the request. “The proposal received by the Central Government will be processed in accordance with law,” the Home Ministry had told the court. Since that case was expected to be heard by the Supreme Court shortly, the Division Bench adjourned by three weeks the hearing of similar petitions filed by other convicts S. Nalini and P. Ravichandran before the High Court. Noting that the State Government had filed a counter-affidavit only in respect of the case filed by Nalini and urged the court to dismiss the plea to release her without waiting any more for the Governor’s assent, the Bench directed the Government to file a counter to Ravichandran’s petition, too, before the next hearing. Mr. Shunmugasundaram said there was no change in the Government’s stand that all the convicts should be released prematurely. He explained that the Government had urged the court to dismiss Nalini’s case, because, as per law, she could not be released without the Governor’s assent.  The proposal received by the Central Government will be processed in accordance with law Home Ministry||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sc-to-hear-on-dec-7-case-of-premature-release-of-rajiv-assassination-convicts/article37763231.ece
30 November 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Leopard found dead||A full-grown leopard, believed to be a male, was found dead at a forest fringe area, abutting the fields at Guttivaripalle village of Peddapanjani mandal under the Koundinya Wildlife Sanctuary zone, 15 km from Palamaner. Some shepherds spotted the carcass of the leopard in a stockade of thorny bushes at the buffer zone on Monday evening. They informed the matter to village sarpanch, who, in turn, passed on the message to the forest officials. The residents said a leopard had been on the prowl close to the village for the last one month, jeopardising the safety of livestock. They suspect the carcass to be that of the same leopard. Divisional Forest Officer S. Ravi Shankar confirmed that a leopard was found dead “under mysterious circumstances.” He said the carcass would be retrieved on Tuesday and a post-mortem would be performed. “Going by the version of the villagers, and the animal’s continuous presence in the vicinity of the human habitat, the leopard could be sick trying to prey on the livestock. It could also be due to wildlife diseases. At the same time, we can’t rule out human intervention. The cause of the death could be ascertained only after postmortem,” the official said. Elephants on prowl Meanwhile, an eight-member herd of wild elephants from Tamil Nadu crossed into Gudupalle mandal near Kuppam on Sunday night, trampling standing crops of vegetables at Sodiganipalyam village. At a paddy field, a farmer Venkatesh and his family had a lucky escape when the jumbos gave them a chase. The herd had reporteldy stomped a heap of paddy bags, besides feeding on the standing crop and trampling a vast stretch of the fields.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/leopard-found-dead/article37763158.ece

30 November 2021||Hassan,ANDHRA PRADESH||Christian prayer hall attacked in Belur||A group of Bajrang Dal activists allegedly disrupted a prayer meeting at Jesus Prayer Hall in Belur town on Sunday, on the ground that “forced religious conversions” were happening at the place. The incident came to light on Monday when the video clips of the incident went viral on social media platforms. Similar incidents have been reported in Belagavi over the last fortnight. The group of about 15-20 people attempted to barge into the prayer hall, even as more than 40 people were engaged in prayer. The devotees stopped the activists from entering and picked up a heated argument with them. Denying the allegations of religious conversion, they said they had been taking part in prayers voluntarily and none had the right to disrupt the prayers. Local police rushed to the place and succeeded in dispersing the mob. Raghu Sakaleshpura, regional coordinator of Bajrang Dal, on Monday told The Hindu that the place where the meeting was held was not a church, but “a centre of conversion”. “The organisers of the prayers are luring people to convert to Christianity through various means. One of our activists had been invited to the prayers on Sunday. When he heard the people inside insulting the Hindu gods, he informed other members. They reached the spot to enquire,” he said. “If the administration allows prayer next week, we will attack,” he said. Suresh Paul, who is in charge of the prayer hall, denied the allegations of the Bajrang Dal and said he was hurt and disappointed by the event. “We were praying inside, nothing else. Can they prove that we were converting people to Christianity,” he asked. Mr. Paul said he had all rights to hold prayers on his private property as the Constitution granted freedom of religion. He said it was the strategy of the Bajrang Dal activists to disturb peace by sending someone from their organisation to attend the prayer and later create an impression of being forced into conversion. Mr. Paul said he had not filed a complaint with the police as someone from the organisation apologised over phone and the police officer held a meeting to resolve the issue amicably.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/christian-prayer-hall-attacked-in-belur/article37763099.ece
30 November 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Never seen such an atrocious Government at Centre: KCR||Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has said he had never come across a Central Government as the present one led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and that he will never see one like this in future. His words came at a post-Cabinet media conference in the context of the Central government’s refusal to purchase paddy produced in the State in the current rabi and its failure to commit itself to the quantity that it proposed to lift in the recent kharif. The Chief Minister warned that the Centre was bent on seeing farmers in the State doomed for its political gains. This was because it was unable to digest the highest production of paddy here which touched a new record of 141 lakh tonnes last year, Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao alleged. Set for a fight The BJP wanted to push farmers back into poverty after they started prospering in separate Telangana due to the welfare measures of the State Government. If the trend continued, it posed a grave threat to the social ecosystem. The State Government will fight it going to any extent. “Drive this Government out, if the country has to prosper,” he appealed to intellectuals. ‘Centre’s job’ He said food security was the statutory responsibility of the Centre by building up adequate buffer stocks through procurement and releasing them for public distribution. But the Government shed the responsibility and resorted to anti-farmer and anti-poor policies which was manifest in the three farm laws repealed in the Lok Sabha on Monday. The Centre had lakhs of crores of budget for the purpose but behaved as a “kirana shop” owner looking at profit and loss. He traced the growth of agriculture and rural economy in the State to the huge strides taken by the Government in irrigation project, power and improvement of groundwater table. But, it was an eye sore to BJP leaders. Mr. Rao cited a letter of Union Minister of Power R.K. Singh asking the State government to support the new power laws. The laws were an attempt to water down the progress of States on power front in the name of reforms. The Centre will want to fix meters at all borewells if the laws were enacted. The borrowing limits of State governments would be scuttled in the new laws. Next, the Centre will want to enjoy monopoly over the sector and scrap the 24-hour free power in the State. Therefore, the State government will not support them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/never-seen-such-an-atrocious-government-at-centre-kcr/article37763097.ece

30 November 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||ED quizzes Vijayabaskar in Kerala under PMLA||The Kochi unit of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is questioning C. Vijayabaskar, former Health Minister of Tamil Nadu, under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in connection with the alleged purchase of gold from a prominent jewellery firm in Kerala. He was summoned to the ED office in Kochi on Monday based on a complaint lodged by a woman based in Alappuzha alleging that the former Minister had purchased gold worth crores from the jewellery firm. It is learnt that the company management had lodged a police complaint against the woman alleging that she had not remitted the money due towards the gold purchased from them. The woman informed the ED that she had received around Rs. 2.5 crore as commission for linking Mr. Vijayabaskar with the jewellery firm for buying gold. The central agency suspected that he may have used black money in his possession to purchase gold worth several crores. Officials of the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) in Tamil Nadu had searched the houses of Mr. Vijayabaskar and his relatives in Pudukottai and other places on October 18 after booking a disproportionate assets case against him and his wife. The DVAC had filed a first information report on information that Mr. Vijayabaskar had indulged in corrupt practices and enriched himself by acquiring assets in his and dependents’ names. False complaint Meanwhile, Mr. Vijayabaskar alleged the woman had previously lodged a “false complaint” against him in Tirunelveli for which he has initiated defamation proceedings. “In response to the ‘witness summon’ issued to me by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with her, I appeared before them,” he said.

While two persons received serious injuries, three suffered minor scratches, said Deputy Superintendent of Police A. Rajendra. The RTC Kurnool Regional Manager T.

30 November 2021||NELLORE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Rain hampers relief works in Nellore, traffic comes to a halt||There was no respite for people in the riverine mandals of SPSR Nellore, as widespread rains continued to lash different parts of the district on Monday. Vehicular traffic in both the directions on the arterial Chennai-Kolkata road was diverted in view of flooding. North-bound vehicles from Chennai and Tirupati were diverted via Naidupeta, Venkatagiri, Rapur and Podalakur. Vehicles going towards Chennai were diverted at Venkatachalam toll plaza towards K.P. Poru road and rejoin the highway via Kodivedu and Kota crossroads, said Superintendent of Police Ch.Vijaya Rao. River Penna was in spate once again, adding to the misery of marooned people in the mandals of Anantasagaram, Atmakur, Buchireddypalem, Chejerla, Indukurpeta, Kalavoya, Kovur, Nellore, Sangam and Vidavaluru in the coastal areas. Rivulets and tanks overflowed causing inundation. A person who was caught in the swirling waters while trying to cross a swollen rivulet was rescued by local people near Gudipadu village. The sharp showers hampered reconstruction of the damaged roads and irrigation sources, which bore the brunt of the flood fury. Large tracts of land and paddy fields were submerged in and around Naidupeta, as Swarnamukhi river was in spate. Gudur bus station resembled a swimming pool with rain water all over the place. Reservoir inflows The inflow into the Somasila reservoir increased by over 50,000 cusecs to 1.05 lakh cusecs. The irrigation department officials let out a huge 1.15 lakh cusecs on Monday evening to maintain a comfortable flood cushion of 9 tmcft of water. There was no threat to the Kandaleru reservoir, as the storage went up to 59.62 tmcft as against the full capacity of 68.03 tmcft following an inflow of 24,600 cusecs. “We are fully vigilant to meet any eventuality,” said Collector K.V.N. Chakradhar Babu, who held a review meeting with district officials on the preparedness, as weathermen predicted more rains in the next 48 hoursin the wake of a low pressure which is likely to develop in the South Andaman sea on Tuesday. The Collector asked officials to submit a daily report on distribution of seeds with 80% subsidy to flood-affected farmers. As many as 48,960 affected families were provided with essential commodities and a relief of Rs. 2,000 each. The families of the four deceased were provided with Rs. 5 lakh each.

30 November 2021||NEW DELHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Karnataka not sharing Krishna details’||Telangana and Andhra Pradesh submitted in the Supreme Court on Monday that there is no information forthcoming from Karnataka for the past 14 years about how much Krishna river water it has diverted. In turn, Karnataka argued that a lot water is going waste —“flowing down into the ocean” — and there is a need to harness it for irrigation and to replenish dry regions. Karnataka has sought the vacation of a November 16, 2011 of the Supreme Court which stopped the Centre from publishing in the Official Gazette the final order of the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal II (KWDT) pronounced in December 2010, allocating the river water to Karnataka, erstwhile Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. The KWDT had further modified its final order and report on November 29, 2013 to allot surplus water to Karnataka, Maharashtra and the erstwhile State of Andhra Pradesh while preserving the allocation of 2,130 tmc ft already made amongst them. The publication of the order of the Tribunal is a necessary pre-condition for its implementation. However, following the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh, its successors Telangana and Andhra Pradesh had moved the Supreme Court challenging the KWDT’s allocation of shares. ‘Projects hit hard’ Karnataka has argued that its dam and irrigation projects worth thousands of crores to provide water to its parched northern areas have been stalled for all these years because of the 2011 order of the Supreme Court to not publish the KWDT decisions in the Official Gazette under Section 6(1) of the Inter-State Water Disputes Act of 1956. Karnataka has argued that the dispute raised by Andhra Pradesh and Telangana was between them and did not concern it. It referred to the Cauvery water dispute, in which the Supreme Court had, in February 2013, ordered the Centre to publish the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal award in the Official Gazette despite the pendency of the cases filed by Karnataka and Tamil Nadu against the Tribunal’s 2007 final order of allocation of water. The Centre successfully sought two weeks’ time. A Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud posted the case for December 13, but not before exclaiming that seven years have elapsed since the KWDT had pronounced its modified final report and order. Issue of ‘grave urgency’ Senior advocates Shyam Divan and Mohan Katarki, for Karnataka, said the issue was of “grave urgency” as far as the State was concerned.  “The life of the KWDT award is 40 years, out of which 10 years have already lapsed and 10 years is required to complete the work... As a result, Karnataka will not be in a position to utilise water 20 out of 40 years,” Karnataka said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/karnataka-not-sharing-krishna-details/article37763093.ece

He was in the port city to attend TTD-sponsored Kartika Deepotsavam festivities. Seshadri had joined the TTD in 1978 and served the institution in various capacities. But for a brief spell in the initial years of his career, he remained posted at the Tirumala temple till his retirement in 2007. In recognition of his dedicated services, he was the only person awarded with multiple extensions post retirement. He had remained the face of TTD and was known for his close association with several politicians including Presidents, Prime Ministers and Chief Ministers of the State besides religious personalities. He was widely appreciated for his role during the post-abolition of archaka mirasi system in 1996. Seshadri was forced to abstain from attending duties inside the hill temple after his name figured in the awkward “Dollar scam” that rocked the institution during the first decade of this century, and later joined after his acquittal by the court and went on to serve the institution for over 43 years till his demise. According to the information reaching here, his mortal remains will be brought to Sirigiri apartments in Tirupati by road and last rites to be performed on Tuesday at Govinda Dhamam. Condolences pour in Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan reddy expressed shock over the sudden demise and conveyed his heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family members.

Many remained unvaccinated due to vaccine shortage or some other reasons.

30 November 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘HMR has carried 20.8 cr. riders, saved 4.7 cr. litres fuel in 4 years’||Hyderabad Metro Rail (HMR) began commercial operations this day four years ago, a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar flagged off the project. In an interview, HMR managing director N.V.S. Reddy, who oversaw the planning and construction of the biggest public, private partnership mode project, says the cumulative ridership is approximately 20.8 crore and it has run about 1.9 crore km so far. “Fuel consumption saved is about 4.7 crore litres and corresponding carbon dioxide emission saved due to saved fuel is approximately 110 million kilos. Carbon dioxide emission saved due to captive solar plant installed in depots and stations is about 14 million kilos,” he informs. The beginning The journey started by covering the 30-km stretch from Nagole to Ameerpet and Ameerpet to Miyapur on November 29, 2017, with a frequency of 15-minute interval for the first four months. “Then it improved to 5 minutes. In pre-COVID era, we ran the trains with peak hour frequency of 3 minutes, 30 seconds as well. Now, the peak hour frequency is of 4 minutes, 30 seconds,” he explains. Punctuality since inception has never gone below 99%, says Mr Reddy and punctuality loss is counted when any trip gets delayed by 59 seconds at the terminal station. “Currently, we have punctuality of 99.6%, which means 99.6% of our trips are on time.” The HMR managing director is happy with the citizens’ response to this mode of public transport. “The better-off sections were generally considering it below their dignity to travel by public transport. Now, with metro, that attitude has changed,” he says. Regarding the resumption of first-last mile connectivity, he says all action plans in this regard are ready. The IT corridor shuttle operations are on hold due to work from home in IT sector, but with the complete reopening of offices, the first and last mile connectivity will only improve. “There is also scope for more parking facility, and e-rickshaws, if allowed, will make connectivity more efficient,” Mr Reddy opines. Safety aspects Asked about maintenance and safety aspects to prevent incidents like the mishap at Ameerpet station in 2019 when a portion of the wall at fell on a 24-year-old woman, killing her, Mr Reddy says, “It was a very unfortunate incident. However, it was a lesson learnt and we have taken every possible step to ensure that no such fall takes place by taking up inspections to identify any loose concrete/plaster/granite/bolt etc. at all stations/viaduct. Immediate corrective actions were taken to prevent any such items from likely falling. This is being done on routine basis,” he says. Ultrasonic Pulse velocity test under supervision of reputed institute had been conducted at all locations, where the viaduct segment and station structural beams were touching to identify the soundness of concrete and taken immediate corrective action to maintain design structural gap, he adds. “Besides, steps were taken to provide additional external drainage pipes, where existing pipes were choked, or water flow was more. Attention was given to station leakages caused by damaged expansion joint and ponding of water. Expansion joints were replaced at necessary locations,” he elaborates.

30 November 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Communal harmony comes to the fore in hoisting temple flagpole||It was a moment of reckoning when the flagpole of the Hanuman temple at Nandi Hills was up in the air facing west instead of east. A panic-stricken priest raised an alarm at the development. “The dhwajasthambam of a temple is very important and the bells on the top known as mekhalalu should face the gopuram. I became worried,” said Seshacharyulu, priest of the temple. Arduous task “Rotating a four tonne, 46-foot flagpole after it is up is challenging. I became breathless when I did that,” says Akbar Ali, the crane operator, a little relaxed after the three-hour operation. His son Ismael clambered on top of the temple to loosen the tensile straps as his father manoeuvred the pillar. As the devotees and visitors cheered and chanted ‘Jai Sri Ram’, Akbar Ali managed to rotate the pillar to face the gopuram. “ Sab logon ki dua hai (it is a result of everyone’s prayers),” he said after finishing the job. Expressing gratitude After the dhwajasthambam was successfully hoisted to its correct position, the temple committee honoured both Akbar Ali and Ismael with a shawl. “It was a proud day for us and luckily, these two gentlemen saved the day,” said Ramdas, son of the man who built the temple in early 80s. “Incidentally, the area gets its name from Nandiah who built most of the villas in the hilly area,” informed Srinivas Murthy, an architect who videographed the dramatic turn of events on Monday morning. “It was a warm feeling that the community can come together to solve problems in these troubled times,” said Mr. Murthy.

30 November 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Utility shifting a challenge for stormwater drain works||Utility shifting is set to be a major challenge for the stormwater drain works being taken up by GHMC under the Strategic Nala Development Programme (SNDP). Drinking water pipelines and sewerage lines criss-crossing in the lanes and bylanes of the city will have to be shifted from wherever the pipelines for stormwater transfer are being planned. Property acquisition had been the major issue in all the earlier proposals, including Kirloskar and Voyants, which advised widening of the existing drains by removing thousands of properties lining them. In order to avoid property acquisition which would cause huge drain on the exchequer, the latest consultant NCPE Infra came up with proposals to fork the nalas wherever a difficult property is encountered. Officials say that this would mean shifting of several pipelines pertaining to drinking water and sewerage, which needs to be done in coordination with the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board. “Drinking water lines still can be managed. But majority of the sewer lines in city are connected to the stormwater drains, which have to be left as they are till alternatives are in place,” an official said. Nala works Ideally, the nala works are better off taken up after the Sewerage Masterplan is implemented by the water board, which would ensure that the storm waterdrains carried only flood water, and no dry flows. However, the government is keen on taking up drain works in localities where major flooding was reported during October last year, in order to avoid repetition of the disaster, officials say. “A few water bodies such as Bandlaguda lake lack surplus channels, due to which water flows through residential areas. We are taking up those works on priority basis,” the official said. Of the total 55 works being taken up in 15 packages under SNDP, 36 fall within the purview of GHMC. Tenders have been called for 24 works, and the bids are under evaluation. Estimates have been received for 11 works which are under scrutiny, and for one work, Detailed Project Report is pending. Government has given administrative sanction for Rs. 858 crore to take up the works, which excludes property acquisition cost.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/utility-shifting-a-challenge-for-stormwater-drain-works/article37763418.ece
30 November 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||No further orders required in Mariamma case: HC||The High Court on Monday said no further orders were required in the custodial death of Mariamma, disposing of a PIL petition filed by People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) seeking a series of reliefs, including probe by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Pronouncing verdict in the petition, the HC made it clear that the State government should take the case registered against the police personnel over the dalit woman’s death to logical conclusion with promptitude. This should be done to create confidence in the hearts of the people, said the judgement delivered by a bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A. Rajasheker Reddy. The government had already dismissed Addagudur police station sub-inspector V. Maheshwar along with constables Rasheed Patel and Janaiah from service. Notices under section 41-A of Criminal Procedure Code were issued to them following a criminal case registered against them over the custodial death. An amount of Rs. 15 lakh to Mariamma’s son Uday Kiran and Rs. 10 lakh each to her two daughters Kasimalla Swapna and Inukonda Sujatha were paid towards compensation. Uday Kiran was also provide a job in Social Welfare Department. “Meaning thereby, the State government has taken some remedial steps in respect of the custodial death,” the verdict said. The bench said in the judgment that the team of doctors from Kakatiya Medical College, Warangal, (who conducted re-post-mortem examination) confirmed there were injuries on Mariamma’s body. The doctors said the cause of Mariamma’s death was due to “sudden cardiac arrest.” It can be concluded that Mariamma was meted out ill-treatment in the hands of Addagudur police of Rachakonda while she was in their custody, going by statements of some witnesses along with findings of second autopsy report, the bench said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/no-further-orders-required-in-mariamma-case-hc/article37763436.ece

They displayed placards with slogans such as “Don’t punish farmers, no injustice to growing States, declare national foodgrain procurement policy” written on them. TRS Parliamentary Party leader K.

Patil, Manne Srinivas Reddy, Pothuganti Ramulu and B. Venkatesh Netha protested by raising slogans and holding placards. They stated that thanks to the vision of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, the State had improved irrigation facilities, ample seed and fertilizer, implementation of schemes such as investment support (Rythu Bandhu) and group life insurance scheme (Rythu Bima) and 24×7 free power to the farm sector and also increased yield and production. There was a need to scale up procurement of foodgrains by FCI and other agencies. The TRS MPs have also requested the Centre to bring in policies for farmers’ welfare including a legislation to ensure minimum support price (MSP) in addition to withdrawal of three farm laws.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-mps-protest-in-parliament/article37763432.ece
30 November 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||TRS govt. responsible for paddy crisis: Kishan Reddy||Union Minister for Tourism, Culture and Northeast States G. Kishan Reddy has accused the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government in the State of having “failed to provide the necessary technology to the rice millers or appropriate seeds to the farmers to see that paddy fit to be processed as raw rice alone is grown and not the one that has to be processed and sold as parboiled rice.” “What has the State government done all these years to bring about a change in technology after having assured the Centre that steps will be taken to introduce measures to ensure only raw rice is produced and not one with high broken grain content which can only be processed as boiled rice? Has any effort been made to educate the farmers?” he questioned at a press conference in New Delhi. Flanked by his party Members of Parliament, Bandi Sanjay Kumar and S. Babu Rao, the Member of Parliament from Secunderabad once again reiterated that this year’s entire produce, whether it is raw rice or fit for boiled rice, will be purchased by the Central government. “We want to assure the farmers that the Modi government is with them and every single grain will be purchased, please take your produce to the nearest procurement centre,” he said. Mr. Kishan Reddy charged that there was a ‘conspiracy’ against the Centre to ‘mislead’ the farmers by giving them wrong information about procurement and leaving them in a confused state by the TRS government. “Farmers should not be made to pay a price for political expediency of the TRS and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao who is still smarting under the loss in Huzurabad byelection. His plans for elevating his son to the top post has been stymied, so he seems to be upset,” he remarked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-govt-responsible-for-paddy-crisis-kishan-reddy/article37763437.ece
30 November 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||No procurement centres for paddy cultivated in rabi||The State government will not open procurement centres for paddy cultivated in the current rabi as the Centre has refused to purchase the stocks but the Rytu Bandhu assistance of Rs. 5,000 an acre to farmers will continue for the season. The government, however, will buy the entire produce of kharif though the Centre had committed to accept only 40 lakh tonnes of custom milled rice while the yield in the season was much high, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao said at a press conference after a Cabinet meeting on Monday. He said there was no question of procuring paddy produced in rabi as the Centre has expressed helplessness to take boiled rice that was generated in rice mills out of the produce. The millers turned out boiled rice out of rabi crop to avoid broken rice which was the result of agro climatic conditions when temperatures shoot up beyond 35 degree C after February 25. Without boiling, the outage of raw rice was only 50%. The method of boiling was suggested by the Food Corporation of India itself. And, now the FCI also went back. The local authorities of FCI agreed to take boiled rice but the Union Minister for Food and PDS Piyush Goyal threatened to suspend them if they had indeed given such an assurance. The Centre refused to take boiled rice citing buffer stocks in FCI godowns to last for another four years. If the stocks went up, it was the responsibility of Centre to explore alternatives even if it meant huge financial drain. One of the alternatives was free distribution of rice,. Mr. Rao said there was no way the State government could procure rabi crop because all the godowns scientifically built for the storage were with the FCI. The government also had no role in exports. It will buy paddy of kharif solely to ensure that the farmers did not suffer. Already, the State has procured 22 lakh tonnes. If the Centre did not purchase the rice of kharif, the government will dump the stocks at the State BJP office and New Delhi. He admitted that the State government had given an undertaking to the Centre not to supply paddy of rabi this year but it was done under duress. He targeted the Centre for not fixing the target for kharif on one hand and refusing to buy the produce of rabi on the other.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/no-procurement-centres-for-paddy-cultivated-in-rabi/article37763408.ece
30 November 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Revanth seeks discussion on paddy procurement in LS||As announced during the ‘Vari Deeksha’ held in Hyderabad, Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president and Malkajgiri MP A. Revanth Reddy gave an adjournment motion notice to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla seeking discussion on non-procurement of paddy by the Centre and State governments. The TPCC chief said that it was to discuss about non-procurement of paddy by the Central and State governments due to which paddy farmers are still waiting at their farm yards and procurements centres with lakhs of tonnes of unsold paddy. Following unseasonal rains, the paddy stocked up at many procurement centres, got soaked and started sprouting. But the government has turned a blind eye towards paddy farmers of Telangana, Mr. Reddy said in his notice. ‘Notice not accepted’ However, the notice was not accepted for discussion in the Lok Sabha on Monday. “The BJP government, which passed and repealed three controversial farm laws without a debate in Parliament, cannot be expected to have a discussion on paddy farmers. However, the Congress party will continue to raise the issue in all possible formats during the ongoing monsoon session of Parliament,” he said. While addressing the two-day ‘Vari Deeksha’ held at Dharna Chowk, Indira Park, he had promised to wage a full-scale war against TRS and BJP governments to protect the interest of paddy farmers of Telangana. “While Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led BJP government at the Centre tried to destroy the entire farm sector in the country through three black laws, Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao-led TRS government is crushing the farmers by ensuring non-procurement of their main produce,” he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/revanth-seeks-discussion-on-paddy-procurement-in-ls/article37763440.ece

However, one can hardly ignore the fact that similar statements had been made when the second wave was setting in. During the devastating second wave, which peaked between the third week of April and first week of May, citizens faced several issues while accessing emergency medical services.  Under pressure The unprecedented surge in cases exposed the chinks in the healthcare system, and hundreds of lives were lost. That apart, the deadly wave resulted in massive financial and emotional devastation for the common people. From shortage of hospital beds to oxygen cylinders and drugs used in the treatment, people faced a range of issues. Though an online dashboard displaying the bed availability in hospitals was provided by the State government, people in distress still had to make the rounds of several hospitals with patients in tow. There were also other problems relating to non-acceptance of insurance policies, overcharging by private hospitals, pressure on cremation grounds and graveyards. Besides, funerals not being conducted post sunset posed as yet another hurdle.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/second-wave-scars-still-fresh/article37763422.ece

However, land allotment was delayed by the Telangana government and the process of Tribal University in Telangana was delinked with that of Central University and Tribal University in Andhra Pradesh. Subsequently, land has been offered by the Telangana government and the Site Selection Committee of MHRD selected the site in Bhupalpally district. The DPR has been prepared and the inter-ministerial consultations have also been completed. The proposal has been moved for the financial approval of the Department of Expenditure, he said. In a statement, Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy said that after seven-and-a-half years in power, the BJP government has just moved the proposal for financial approval to the Department of Expenditure and this shows that no funds have been allocated by the BJP government.

In an incredible show of unwavering perseverance and steely resolve, the farmers set an example worthy of emulation by all those fighting against authoritarian regimes, he said. He was speaking at the 21st district conference of the CPI(M) here on Monday. Over 750 farmers have lost their lives in the year-long struggle against the black laws thrusted on the farming community by the BJP dispensation at the Centre, he said, hailing the farmers for steering the historic struggle to its logical end with insurmountable grit. The BJP regime at the Centre is hell-bent on selling the public assets across key sectors - including ports, railways, insurance and public sector, unlocking the doors for corporate loot, he alleged. TRS blamed He charged the TRS regime in the State with miserably failing to fulfil its electoral promises to the unemployed youth and leaving the farmers in the lurch. "The historic farmers’ struggle which emerged triumphant over the anti-farmer policies is a source of inspiration for the mass organisations to spearhead united movements against the anti-poor and pro-corporate policies of the persons at the helm in the State and the Centre," he said.

The tiger reportedly entered the Kothaguda forest area from the forest fringe areas of the neighbouring Bhadradri-Kothagudem or Mulugu districts a few days ago. The big cat, which killed a cow near Nelavancha in Gudur reserve forest area, on Friday night, remained elusive since then. Camera traps Sources in the Forest department said the tiger has not been spotted despite continuous monitoring of its movement through camera traps and stepped-up vigil in the fringe areas of the forests in the district so far. Sources added that the tiger might have moved deep inside the woods or crossed over to the forests in the neighbouring districts. Meanwhile, the authorities alerted the field functionaries of the Panchayat Raj and other allied government departments to dissuade cattle grazers and forest dwellers of Gudur and its adjoining mandals from entering into the forest areas as a safety precaution. Apart from intensifying vigil to track the movement of the elusive tiger, the Forest department is carrying out an awareness campaign in the villages located in the vicinity of forests to ensure safety of those living in the fringe areas of the forests and also the tiger.  It might have moved deep inside the woods or crossed over to the forests in the neighbouring districts.

30 November 2021||Chandigarh,||Will form the next govt. in Punjab with BJP, Akali faction: Amarinder||Former Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Monday said his party will form the next government in the State along with the BJP and a breakaway Akali faction as he held a surprise meeting with Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal here. Capt. Amarinder described his meeting with Mr. Lal as a courtesy call. “There was no political development. I had a very nice cup of coffee with the Chief Minister,” said the former Punjab Chief Minister after meeting Mr. Lal. ‘Wait for the time’ However, when asked whether “big faces” will join his party, Punjab Lok Congress, ahead of the Assembly elections, he said, “Wait for the time. Everything is going fine. People are very upbeat and our membership drive is going good.” “God willing, we and with our seat adjustment with the BJP and with Mr. (Sukhdev Singh) Dhindsa’s party (SAD Sanyukt), we will form the government,” he said. Capt. Amarinder had quit the Congress following his resignation as the Punjab Chief Minister after a bitter power tussle with State Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu. His meeting with Mr. Lal came on a day when a Bill to repeal the three contentious laws, against which farmers have been protesting for over a year, was passed by the Parliament. “I have met the Chief Minister does not mean that when you meet someone it is political something. This is just a normal courtesy call,” he told reporters replying to a query on any talk of an alliance with the BJP. In the photographs of their meeting released by the Haryana Government, Mr. Lal is seen receiving Capt. Amarinder with a warm hug. Asked if he will meet BJP leaders for a seat sharing arrangement for the Punjab elections, the former Punjab Chief Minister said he will go to Delhi and certainly call on them. ‘There is no issue left’ Replying to a question on the farm laws, he said, “Everything is now over. The three bills (laws) have been repealed by Parliament.” Capt Amarinder said the Centre has agreed to other six to seven issues raised by farmers. “So, there is no issue left,” he said. On the farmers’ demand for the withdrawal of police cases against protesters, he said the Centre will take a look at these cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/will-form-the-next-govt-in-punjab-with-bjp-akali-faction-amarinder/article37763337.ece
30 November 2021||JAIPUR,||Rajasthan CM’s advisers may not get ministerial status||The ruling Congress in Rajasthan is finding it difficult to appoint MLAs as advisers to the Chief Minister as well as Parliamentary Secretaries after the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party took the issue to Raj Bhavan through a memorandum. Governor Kalraj Mishra has sought a clarification on the issue of “office of profit”. The six advisers appointed after the expansion and reshuffle of the Council of Ministers on November 21, and the Parliamentary Secretaries likely to be appointed shortly may neither get the Ministerial status nor any perks. With this, the Congress is set to face the ire of its legislators who could not be accommodated in the Cabinet expansion, which took it to its full strength of 30. The BJP has raised a strong objection to the appointments. Deputy Leader of Opposition Rajendra Rathore submitted a memorandum to the Governor last week alleging that the posts of advisers were unconstitutional as they were offices of profit. In an attempt to avoid the charge of flouting the law on holding of office of profit and bypassing the constitutional provisions, the State Government has made up its mind to not give the perks of office to the MLAs. . ‘Needless controversy’ Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had said here on Sunday that he was only taking advice from the six MLAs without giving them any new status and it was a “needless controversy”. “I can appoint an MLA, MP, journalist, intellectual or littérateur as my adviser. That is my prerogative... nobody can question the CM for doing this,” he had said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/rajasthan-cms-advisers-may-not-get-ministerial-status/article37763334.ece
30 November 2021||JAIPUR,||Good news from Banswara for malnourished children||Following the adoption of a bottom-up approach to strengthen child protection systems, 43% of malnourished children in one of the 11 blocks in tribal-dominated Banswara district in southern Rajasthan have hit the normal mark. The initiative has sought to protect the most vulnerable ones among the undernourished children and safeguarded them against a possible third wave of the pandemic. The drive for improving health status of children and adolescents in 750 villages of Banswara district was taken up through a “Poshan Swaraj Abhiyan”, followed by the observance of a child rights week in November's third week. The campaign has promoted indigenous food practices and trained women in cooking nutritious meals for their children by using the abundant and diverse edible materials available in the region. The tribal communities in southern Rajasthan have been utilising their indigenous practices of food and agricultural management to tide over the difficult periods of drought and scarcity. They dealt with the lockdown enforced last year amid the pandemic by following their customs. Banswara-based Vaagdhara, which works on tribal livelihood issues, took up the drive in collaboration with the district administration and the Integrated Child Development Services. About 67,000 children residing in five blocks of the district were screened at the start of the campaign and the identified ones among them provided with nutritious food cooked using the local edible items at the special nutrition and counselling camps. Significant reduction The results for Kushalgarh block, released by the district administration, have revealed a significant reduction in the percentage of malnourished children aged up to six years. Of the 16,000 children in the block, 4,045 were identified as malnourished, who were covered in the campaign. Among them, 41.43% were identified as severely malnourished children. After 15 days of the drive, the nutritional status of children was found as improved and more than 33% of them came up into the normal category. When further screened earlier this month, an increment of 10 percentage points was observed among the normal children and a reduction of 4.7 percentage points seen among moderately acute malnourished and 5.6 percentage points among severely acute malnourished children. Vaagdhara secretary Jayesh Joshi told The Hindu that the results of Kushalgarh block had shown that the ‘swaraj’ philosophy, based on the food management with indigenous resources, would succeed in maintaining an appropriate health status for both children and adults. Similar results were expected from Ghatol, Anandpuri, Sajjangarh and Gangadtalai blocks, he said. Tracking through app The identified children were nourished everyday with indigenous food groups, such as small millets, vegetables, sprouted grains, groundnuts, ragi and til laddoos and sama kheer, and their mothers were asked to feed them with similar nutritious meals after the campaign ended. Anganwadi workers tracked the malnourished children through a mobile app after their division into three categories.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/good-news-from-banswara-for-malnourished-children/article37763494.ece

Vijayabaskar, former Health Minister of Tamil Nadu, under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act in connection with alleged purchase of gold from a prominent jewellery firm in Kerala.

The woman informed the ED that she had received around Rs. 2.5 crore as commission for linking Mr. Vijayabaskar with the jewellery firm for buying gold. The central agency suspected that he may have used black money in his possession to purchase gold worth several crores. Officials of the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) in Tamil Nadu had searched the houses of Mr. Vijayabaskar and his relatives in Pudukottai and other places on October 18 after booking a disproportionate assets case against him and his wife.

A medical test was conducted on September 9 and the report submitted to the Bombay High Court on Monday. It stated that Mr. Rao is suspected to have early stage Parkinson’s along with other medical ailments.

30 November 2021||New Delhi,||Won’t do away with fair price shops, Delhi Govt. tells HC||The Delhi Government on Monday defended before the Delhi High Court its scheme for doorstep delivery of ration, saying that it was optional and beneficiaries could opt out any time. The notion that fair price shops (FPS) would cease to exist on its implementation was a “complete misconception”, it told the court. The Government, represented by senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, submitted that the State is not seeking to do away with FPS. “In the last two years, there is home delivery of everything, be it COVID-generated or non-COVID-generated. It is a complete misconception or wrongly implied that FPS ceases to exist. The senior advocate also called the petition filed by Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers Sangh challenging the Delhi Government’s scheme for doorstep delivery, Mukhya Mantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna, as “nothing but proxy litigation set up by somebody else who is not the petitioner”. Mr. Singhvi argued that States like Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, and Karnataka’s Bengaluru have identical doorstep delivery schemes. He said with the march of technology, doorstep delivery becomes the norm, and this is something that needs applause and not criticism. Centre’s plea During the hearing, Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, representing the Centre, said the court should not allow any State to interfere with the structure of National Food Security Act (NFSA) and destroy its architecture. “As Union of India, we are only concerned with complete compliance of NFSA,” she said. The Centre has been opposing the Delhi Government’s ration delivery scheme on the ground that the State cannot mitigate the architecture of the NFSA while implementing it. On November 15, the Supreme Court had refused to entertain the Centre’s plea against the Delhi High Court order directing the Delhi government not to stop or curtail the supply of foodgrains or flour to fair price shops. The High Court had on September 27 directed the Delhi Government to issue communications to all the fair price shop dealers informing them of the particulars of ration cardholders who have opted to receive their rations at the doorstep. It had said only thereafter, the fair price shops dealers are not required to be supplied with the ration of the PDS beneficiaries who have opted for doorstep delivery.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/wont-do-away-with-fair-price-shops-delhi-govt-tells-hc/article37763329.ece

Mr. Sisodia further said that it will take some time to get clarity on how deadly the new variant is or how it will affect those who are vaccinated. Dedicated hospital The Delhi Government on Monday designated Lok Nayak Hospital for treatment of any patients found infected with the new variant. “Lok Nayak Hospital is hereby designated as the dedicated hospital which will treat patients detected with the new variant of SARS-CoV-2.

The season’s total has reached 8,276 cases, the highest since 2015 when the city reported close to 16,000 cases. The death toll stands at nine. North Delhi saw the highest number of cases last week at 273, followed by south Delhi with 242 cases and east Delhi with 192 cases. Till November 20, Delhi had recorded 7,128 cases. Between November 13 and 20, north Delhi saw 543 cases, followed by south Delhi with 444 cases, while east Delhi reported 221 cases. A majority of Delhi’s dengue cases for this season were recorded in November. In October, the Capital reported 1,196 cases, while there were 217 cases in September. “Dengue cases have dropped at a swift rate but people should continue to monitor mosquito-breeding sites at their homes. The halt in rain has been a major factor for the dip in cases,” a civic body official said. In the current season, north Delhi has recorded 2,389 cases, followed by south Delhi with 2,298 cases. East Delhi has reported 931 cases, the lowest among the three municipal corporations. Apart from the corporations, the New Delhi Municipal Council recorded 72 cases, while Delhi Cantonment and other areas reported 132 and 17 cases respectively, for this season. “We are hardly seeing any new cases, not even for consultations at the OPD. There is no new admission as well. The change in the weather can be attributed to the drop in cases,” a doctor at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/dengue-cases-cross-8000-mark-in-delhi/article37763315.ece
30 November 2021||New Delhi,||Matiala church body refutes charges of forced conversion||A day after a church in west Delhi’s Matiala was vandalised and the Sunday mass disrupted by “local miscreants”, some followers went back to Punjab where the Christian body operating the church has its headquarters, while a few others stayed inside their homes, refusing to speak about the incident. The main gate of the church remained locked, its signboard vandalised, on Monday. Police presence was beefed up in the area with one officer from the Bindapur police station deployed there for round-the-clock surveillance. FIRs against both parties DCP (Dwarka) Shankar Choudhary visited the spot on Monday. He said FIRs have been lodged against both the parties, the miscreants and those holding the prayers, while one of the locals has been arrested. Vivaan George, part of the Christian body, said all the allegations against the worshippers of being involved in forced conversion of locals were baseless. He said they were peacefully holding the Sunday mass when Bajrang Dal members barged in and vandalised the premises. “Our head pastor will arrive on Friday and we will hold a discussion with the local administration and the police on how to go forward with the prayers,” he said. The church was inaugurated last week and the first Sunday mass was being held when the incident happened. Sanjay George, also part of the same organisation, said the Bajrang Dal members instigated the local population to object to the prayers. “I was not part of the prayers on the intervening night but when the news broke, I came here and found the church vandalised... They were peacefully carrying out the prayers and bothering no one,” he said. A local who stays opposite the church, requesting anonymity, said they were not in favour of the church being constructed and the worshippers “created ruckus in the neighbourhood”. The police had earlier said that the premises, which was a godown, was turned into a church overnight. Bajrang Dal spokesperson Vinod Bansal said they had sent a team to the church after they received information about some boys “being forced to convert”. “Our team protested and raised slogans as it was a fake church which was forcing locals to join them... The allegations of people being beaten up are not true,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/matiala-church-body-refutes-charges-of-forced-conversion/article37763318.ece

30 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||CBI books Rajkot firm for bank fraud||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered a case against a Rajkot-based company and others on the allegation that they cheated the Union Bank of India of Rs. 44.64 crore. The accused have been identified as Mandeep Industries and its functionaries, Ashish B. Talaviya, Kishorbhai H. Vaishnavi, Ramjibhai H. Gajera, Kalpesh Pravinbhai Talaviya and Bhavesh M. Talaviya. “Searches were conducted at seven places, including the office and residential premises of the accused persons at Upleta and Rajkot (Gujarat),” said a CBI official. Some bank officials are also under scrutiny. Oil supplier The company is engaged in extraction of oil from groundnut cake. The oil is supplied to poultry industry and also exported to West Asian countries. It was alleged that from 2014 to 2020, the accused persons induced the bank to sanction various credit facilities including cash credit and term loans, amounting to Rs. 47.30 crore. The loan account of the borrower company was later classified as a non-performing asset on January 15 last year due to non-servicing of interest and instalments. This allegedly caused a loss of Rs. 44.64 crore to the bank. A forensic analysis of the financial transactions revealed that the company had made payments to certain parties which were shown as debtors. While the stock statements were falsified, inflated payments were made to certain entities, it is alleged. The company also availed itself of the drawing power against the book debts of sister concerns, according to the First Information Report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/cbi-books-rajkot-firm-for-bank-fraud/article37763330.ece

30 November 2021||PATNA,||Trapped miners dig their way out after 60 hours||Four people who were trapped inside an abandoned coal mine in Bokaro, Jharkhand, dug their own way out early on Monday morning and reached home after over 60 hours. Lakshman Rajwar (42), Anadi Singh (45), Ravana Rajwar (46) and Bharat Singh (45), all residents of Tilatand village of Chandankyari block in Bokaro district, were among the six who had gone to excavate coal illegally in an abandoned Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL) mine at Parbatpur on November 26 when it caved in trapping them. Two, however, managed to come out. “We had alerted BCCL officials, and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel were deployed there to look for the trapped villagers. But they all came out on their own around 3:30 am on Monday,” said Bokaro Superintendent of Police Chandan Kumar Jha. The Bokaro police has asked BCCL authorities to fill up such abandoned coal mines “so that such incident would not be repeated”, he said. The NDRF team reached the spot on Sunday and started its operation, but failed to locate the trapped villagers. All the four survived on water and kept digging day and night. They finally emerged from the mine in the early hours of Monday. “For the first few hours we waited for help, but then realized we will have to dig our own way out. We took turns to dig day and night to conserve our torch battery and the limited amount of water. Thankfully, we were going in the right direction,” said Lakshman Rajwar. The villagers and family members who had lost all hope of seeing them alive celebrated their home coming. Jharkhand accounts for 29% of India’s coal reserves and three big coal companies, BCCL, CCL(Central Coalfields Limited) and ECL (Eastern Coalfields Limited), operate here. According to a BCCL official, there are hundreds of abandoned coal mines in Bokaro, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh, Ramgarh, and others areas of Jharkhand where poor tribal people are engaged by coal mafias to excavate coal worth of several crores. On the road near Ramgarh, one can see a long line of villagers pulling their bicycles loaded with coal excavated from abandoned mines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/trapped-miners-dig-their-way-out-after-60-hours/article37763319.ece

Arrangements are being made for institutional separation of passengers who test positive for COVID-19, he added. Meanwhile, authorities have sent the blood sample of a 32-year-old resident of Dombivli, who arrived from South Africa last week and tested Covid-positive, for genome sequencing to ascertain if he has been infected with the new Omicron variant. Officials said he was stable and has been kept in isolation. At a meeting of the State cabinet on Monday morning, held amid rising concerns over the Omicron variant, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said it would be easier to trace passengers and their contacts if international and domestic airlines regularly shared passenger information. State Health Minister Rajesh Tope said there was no need to panic as no case had been detected. He said schools would reopen for Class 1 to 7 students from December 1 and asked parents not to worry about sending their children.

The decision to shift to Mumbai has been taken due to the health of Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, who had a spinal surgery recently and has been advised against flying. “As the Chief Minister wanted to be present for the session, it was decided to shift the venue to Mumbai this winter session,” Mr. Parab said after attending the meeting of the Business Advisory Council (BAC). He said a decision to extend the duration of the session will be taken on December 24. BJP protests move Expressing dissatisfaction with the BAC meeting, former chief minister and the BJP’s Leader of Opposition in the Assembly, Devendra Fadnavis, protested the decision to shift the venue and the decision to curtail the winter session to barely five days. Criticising the short session, BJP State vice-president Madhav Bhandari, said, “All businesses are gradually resuming. Even Parliament session is on. But MVA government is scared to face the Assembly.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/assembly-session-in-mumbai-from-dec-22/article37763323.ece

The State health department, in a letter to all District Collectors, also directed that fresh guidelines for international travellers issued by the Union Health Ministry for tackling the new COVID variant must be followed strictly, a public relations department official said. Fresh guidelines The fresh guidelines stressed on effective surveillance and screening of passengers coming to India from 'at risk' countries where the new variant was found, the letter informed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/help-desks-at-airports/article37763332.ece

30 November 2021||Brussels,||Omicron: wary world slams doors shut||Countries around the world slammed their doors shut again to try to keep the new Omicron variant at bay on Monday, even as more cases of the mutant coronavirus emerged and scientists raced to figure out just how dangerous it might be. Japan announced it would bar entry of all foreign visitors, while new cases of the variant identified days ago by researchers in South Africa appeared in places such as Hong Kong and Australia. New cases in Portugal and Scotland might already point towards local spread of the variant outside of southern Africa. “There might already be some community transmission of this variant in Scotland,” First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said after Scotland reported its first six cases. The infections showed the near impossibility of keeping the genie in the bottle in a globalised world of travel and open borders. Yet, many tried to do just that, even against the urging of the World Health Organization, which noted that border closings often have limited effect and can wreak havoc on lives and livelihoods. Some argued that such restrictions could provide valuable time to analyse the new variant. Little is known about it, including whether it is more contagious, more likely to cause serious illness or more able to evade the protection of vaccines.  “This time the world showed it is learning,” said European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, singling out South African President Cyril Ramaphosa for praise. “South Africa’s analytic work and transparency and sharing its results was indispensable in allowing a swift global response. It no doubt saved many lives.” The WHO has praised Botswana as well as South Africa for quickly alerting the world to the presence of the new variant — and many have warned the countries should not be punished for their speed. But that did not hold Ms. von der Leyen back from pushing the 27-nation EU toward imposing an immediate ban on flights from seven southern African nations — similar to measures many countries have taken. Cases had already been reported in Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands before Portuguese authorities identified 13 cases of Omicron among team members of the Belenenses professional soccer club. Authorities reported that one member recently traveled to South Africa. Its game against Benfica over the weekend had be abandoned at halftime for lack of players.  Taking no chances, Japan, which has yet to detect any Omicron cases, reimposed border controls that it eased earlier this month for short-term business visitors, foreign students and workers. “We are taking the step as an emergency precaution to prevent a worst-case scenario in Japan,” Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said. The new measures begin on Tuesday. Israel likewise decided to bar entry to foreigners, and Morocco said it would suspend all incoming flights for two weeks starting Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/omicron-wary-world-slams-doors-shut/article37762903.ece
30 November 2021||Brussels,||Taliban ask EU for help with airports in Afghanistan||The Taliban asked for help in keeping Afghanistan’s airports running in weekend talks with EU officials that also raised “grave concern” about the humanitarian situation in their country, according to an EU statement late on Sunday. Both sides sent senior officials to the Qatari capital Doha for the talks, which happened just ahead of two weeks of negotiations between the U.S. and the Taliban due to start on Monday, also in Doha. The EU’s European External Action Service (EEAS) said in its statement that “the dialogue does not imply recognition by the EU of the interim (Taliban) government but is part of EU’s operational engagement, in the interest of the EU and the Afghan people”.  The EU statement said the Taliban vowed to stick by its promise of “amnesty” for Afghans who had worked against it during the two decades of Western-oriented rule up to the hasty exit and evacuation by the U.S. and its allies in August. The Taliban side also re-committed to allowing Afghans and foreigners to leave if they wish so, but “requested assistance for maintaining operations of airports” so that could happen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/taliban-asks-eu-for-help-with-afghanistans-airports/article37762895.ece
30 November 2021||Vienna,||Iran ‘determined’ to salvage nuclear deal as talks resume||International talks on Iran’s nuclear programme restarted Monday after a five-month hiatus with Tehran “determined” to reach a deal as analysts warn of major obstacles to any speedy resumption of the 2015 nuclear deal. Iran paused the negotiations in June after the election of an ultraconservative new President, Ebrahim Raisi. Diplomats at the time had said they were “close” to an agreement. Iran ignored appeals from Western countries to restart the talks for several months, all the while strengthening the capabilities of its nuclear programme. In August, Mr. Raisi said Iran was again open to talks. The talks started just after 3 p.m. in the Palais Coburg hotel where the 2015 agreement — known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) —was clinched. Along with Iran, diplomats from Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia are attending. The United States is taking part in the talks indirectly. On Monday, Iran said it had “a firm determination to reach an agreement and is looking forward to fruitful talks”. “If the other side shows the same willingness, we will be on the right track to reach an agreement,” said Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Said Khatibzadeh. Last week, US Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley said Tehran’s attitude “doesn’t augur well for the talks”. “If they start getting too close, too close for comfort, then of course we will not be prepared to sit idly,” Mr. Malley told the U.S. National Public Radio. Bring back on track The EU, which is chairing the talks, said on Monday it was “crucial to pick up from where we left it last June, and that all sides work swiftly and constructively to bring the JCPOA back on track as soon as possible”. The JCPOA offered a lifting of some of the array of economic sanctions Iran had been under in return for strict curbs on its nuclear programme. But the deal started to unravel in 2018 when then-U.S. president Donald Trump pulled out and began reinstating sanctions on Iran.  The year after Mr. Trump’s move, Iran retaliated by starting to exceed the limits on its nuclear activity laid down in the deal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/tehran-determined-to-salvage-nuclear-deal/article37762889.ece
30 November 2021||Colombo,||Sri Lankan troops break up Tamil memorials to war dead||Armed troops broke up Tamil memorials for Sri Lanka’s civil war dead and beat up journalists covering a ceremony in a former battle zone, residents and media organisations said on Monday. Grieving relatives were forced out of cemeteries on the weekend as they attempted to light lamps at graves of loved ones who died in the island’s decades-long conflict, which ended in 2009. The Federation of Media Employees’ Trade Unions said Tamil journalists covering a memorial in Mullaittivu, a northeastern fishing town where the war’s final battle was fought, were assaulted by troops. Stick with barbed wire “Soldiers used a palm stick wrapped with barbed wire to assault a photojournalist covering the events,” the media outfit said in a statement. It added that reporters in northern and eastern Sri Lanka, where the island’s minority Tamil community is concentrated, have been subject to “constant harassment” by security authorities. The police said they were investigating a complaint of assault made by journalists in Mullaittivu. Sri Lanka’s 37-year civil war began in 1972 when the Tamil Tigers waged a bloody campaign against government troops for a separate ethnic homeland. ‘Heroes Day’ November 27 was from the late 1980s commemorated as “Heroes’ Day” by the Tigers to honour members of the militant group who died in the conflict. But President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s Government has banned Tamil commemorations of the war dead since coming to power in 2019. Mr. Rajapaksa was defence chief when the Tigers were defeated in 2009 while his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa was President, winning them adoration from much of the majority Sinhalese population. The separatist war cost the lives of more than 1,00,000 people, according to United Nations estimates. The UN accused Sri Lankan forces of killing at least 40,000 Tamil civilians in its military campaign, an allegation denied by successive Governments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/sri-lankan-troops-break-up-tamil-memorials-for-war-dead/article37762893.ece
30 November 2021||New York,||Indian-origin Parag Agrawal to replace Dorsey as Twitter CEO||Indian-origin technology executive Parag Agrawal was appointed the new chief executive officer of Twitter after the social media giant’s co-founder Jack Dorsey stepped down on Monday. In a message posted on Twitter, Mr. Dorsey said: “After almost 16 years of having a role at our company… from co-founder to CEO to Chair to Exec Chair to interim-CEO to CEO… I decided it’s finally time for me to leave. Why? “There’s a lot of talk about the importance of a company being “founder-led”. “Ultimately, I believe that’s severely limiting and a single point of failure. I’ve worked hard to ensure this company can break away from its founding and founders,” he said. Mr. Agrawal, an IIT Bombay and Stanford alumnus, said in a note posted on Twitter that he was “honoured and humbled” on his appointment and expressed gratitude to Mr. Dorsey’s “continued mentorship and your friendship”. Mr. Dorsey said that there were three reasons he believed it was the right time. “The first is Parag becoming our CEO. The board ran a rigorous process considering all options and unanimously appointed Parag. He’s been my choice for some time given how deeply he understands the company and its needs,” he said. “Parag has been behind every critical decision that helped turn this company around. He’s curious, probing, rational, creative, demanding, self-aware and humble,” Mr. Dorsey said. “He leads with heart and soul, and is someone I learn from daily. My trust in him as our CEO is bone deep,” Mr. Dorsey added. Mr. Agrawal joined Twitter 10 years ago when there were fewer than 1,000 employees. He said: “While it was a decade ago, those days feel like yesterday to me. I’ve walked in your shoes, I’ve seen the ups and downs, the challenges and obstacles, the wins and the mistakes. “But then and now, above all else, I see Twitter’s incredible impact, our continued progress, and the exciting opportunities ahead of us,” Mr. Agrawal said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/jack-dorsey-steps-down-as-twitter-ceo/article37762901.ece
30 November 2021||TEGUCIGALPA,||Leftist holds commanding lead in Honduran presidential vote||Leftist Opposition candidate Xiomara Castro held a commanding lead early on Monday as Hondurans appeared poised to remove the conservative National Party from power after 12 years of continuous rule. Ms. Castro declared herself the winner despite orders from the National Electoral Council to political parties to await official results. “We win! We win!” Ms. Castro, Honduras’ former first lady who is making her third presidential run, told cheering Liberty and Re-foundation party supporters when only a fraction of the ballots had been tallied. “Today the people have obtained justice. We have reversed authoritarianism.” She is set to become the first woman President of Honduras. The National Party also quickly declared victory for its candidate, Tegucigalpa Mayor Nasry Asfura, but the early returns were not promising. By early Monday, Ms. Castro’s wide early lead was holding up. With 51% of the polling station tallies in, Ms. Castro had 53% of the votes and Mr. Asfura 33%, according to the National Electoral Council preliminary count. With more than 1.8 million votes counted, Ms. Castro held a margin of more than 3,50,000 votes. The council said the turnout was more than 68%. The capital awoke slowly on Monday after a long night of celebration. Streets were void of the usual work week traffic and instead conveyed the quiet calm of a holiday morning. As stacks of newspapers hit the sidewalks around the city, it was clear the country’s major outlets could not resist giving the victory to Ms. Castro despite warnings from the National Electoral Council to wait for official results. Along Morazan Boulevard where thousands partied into the early morning, businesses remained boarded, still uncertain of whether it was safe to open. Graffiti poked a finger in the eye of the National Party, urging its leaders, especially outgoing President Juan Orlando Hernández to hurry toward the exits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/leftist-holds-commanding-lead-in-honduran-presidential-vote/article37762897.ece
30 November 2021||Taipei,||Baltic lawmakers meet Taiwanese President||Lawmakers from all three Baltic states met Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen on Monday in a sign of further cooperation between European Union nations and Taiwan. It is the first joint visit to Taiwan by Members of Parliament from Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, Ms. Tsai said. She welcomed the lawmakers, who are attending the 2021 Open Parliament Forum, hosted by Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. China claims Taiwan is its own territory and rejects any attempts by the self-ruled island to participate in international forums or establish diplomatic relations with other countries that would give it international recognition. Ms. Tsai noted the values and experiences that Taiwan has in common with the three countries. “Taiwan and the Baltic nations share similar experiences of breaking free of authoritarian rule and fighting for freedom. The democracy we enjoy today was hard earned,” Ms. Tsai said. “This is something we all understand most profoundly.” Matas Maldeikis, head of the Lithuanian delegation, said he hopes to see even stronger ties with Taiwan. “We are here to express our solidarity with you. We hope the soon-to-be-open Lithuanian trade office in Taiwan will help to expand the partnership between Taiwan and Lithuania and contribute to a closer relationship with Taiwan and the whole European bloc,” he said. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the visit by the Baltic lawmakers on Monday, with spokesman Wang Wenbin issuing a warning. “We urge the parties concerned to be cautious with their words and acts and to stop sending wrong signals to the Taiwan independence force,” the spokesman said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/baltic-lawmakers-meet-taiwanese-president/article37762896.ece

He stressed that the United States was in a good position to control Omicron’s spread without having to resort to lockdowns or more travel bans beyond restrictions already imposed on eight southern African countries. “We have more tools today to fight the variant than we’ve ever had before,” he said, adding that his chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci expects current vaccines to work against the new variant, with boosters enhancing protection.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/not-a-cause-for-panic-biden/article37763130.ece

The move, backed by a scientific advisory body and Health Secretary Sajid Javid, comes as Ministers scramble to react swiftly to the new variant. Until now, only adults aged 40 and above were eligible for a booster dose six months after their last. But that time-frame will now be halved to three months, alongside the programme’s expansion to all over-18s, with priority given to older people. “These measures will protect more people, more quickly and make us better protected as a nation,” Mr. Javid told MPs. He noted it was “a huge step up” for the vaccination scheme, which was launched last December, almost doubling the number of people eligible for a booster.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/booster-shots-for-all-uk-adults/article37762890.ece

30 November 2021||November 30 2021 00:00 IST,||The three farm laws were never a solution||The recent announcement by the Prime Minister that the Union Government would seek to repeal the three Farm Laws in the winter session of Parliament has prompted diverse reactions. On November 29, the first day in Parliament, the Farm Laws Repeal Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha without discussion. These laws are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act (ECA), 2020. Regardless of how this specific step is viewed and the motivations attributed to it, the prolonged protests by farmers and extended impasse offer a rare teachable moment for policy making for Indian agriculture. Purpose, ‘creation’, passage To recall, the three laws each intended to remove constraints on buyers to stock, contract and purchase agricultural commodities. Whereas the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 (ECA) was largely the prerogative of the Centre, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 governing contract farming and the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 (henceforth, the APMC Bypass Act), focusing on the public regulated markets were hitherto issues that were under the State-level Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Acts, therefore under the purview of the States. The most troubling aspect of these laws was the way they were written and passed. First, little is known to the public even today on who authored these laws or who was consulted before their introduction as ordinances. Second, these were passed in Parliament in haste by voice vote, in what is viewed by experts as a violation of established procedures. That Acts with serious ramifications for States should be passed without deeper discussions even within Parliament, let alone with specific inputs from stakeholders and experts, is bewildering. Attempts by some to deflect such criticism by noting the long history of discussion on agricultural market reform only serves to shine a light on the departure from such a tradition in the case of these three laws. Such opaque processes increase the likelihood of poorly framed laws; indeed, many critics have pointed out serious flaws in these laws. Centre-State agri-relations Crucially, the APMC Bypass Act mandated that States can only regulate, via their respective APMCs, designated physical premises called the ‘market yards’. Via this Act, the Centre essentially wrested control of market areas outside these yards, now called ‘trade areas’, from the States. The dominant popular narrative was that the Centre was doing what the States had failed to do, i.e., free agricultural trade from the clutches of the APMCs, an idea that finds support in the Economic Survey 2014-15. Yet, perversely, the APMC Bypass Act particularly hurt States that had the most deregulated systems. A State that had no APMC Act, for example, suddenly found that all deregulated areas within the State would now come under the Centre’s regulatory ambit and control, subjecting private players hitherto operating freely in a deregulated environment to the regulations of a whimsical Centre. Further, by absolving private players from adhering to any State law in agricultural marketing, it effectively nullified the power of States to shape the nature and functioning of agricultural markets. Such transfer of regulatory authority from the States to the Centre might in principle be justified if there was systematic evidence to suggest that the Centre was better informed and better equipped to regulate agricultural markets. Here, the Centre’s own actions following the three laws do not inspire confidence. For example, barely weeks after the ECA was amended, the Centre imposed restrictions on stocking, in October 2020 for onions and July 2021 for a range of pulses, apparently undermining the purported spirit of the reformed ECA it championed.  During the pandemic  Our analysis of COVID-19 lockdown management in the agricultural sector too found that the Centre was always a step behind, implementing relief measures for agricultural marketing reactively rather than proactively. In contrast, States, regardless of the ruling parties, offered a more timely, relevant and nimble response to manage the fallout of the COVID-19 lockdown on agriculture. Beyond agricultural marketing, the central government’s efforts in the past such as One Million Ponds, 10,000 FPOs and One District One Product are often disconnected from local needs for robust and sustainable solutions for agriculture. Another key concern is that to the extent that these Acts enable centralisation of authority to influence the functioning of trade areas, this would facilitate consolidation of big business, a trend that is evident globally. The underlying premise of these three Acts was that freedom to operate in agricultural markets would attract capital-rich private players to a sector in sore need of rejuvenating investments; and that the proliferation of efficient value chains and competition would enable benefits to be passed on to the farmers in the form of higher, and perhaps more stable prices. While it is hard to disagree with the purported goal of these Acts, many critics question the premise itself, pointing out that it was naive at best, and insidious at worst; the Acts in fact load the dice in favour of corporates with deep pockets who would now use this freedom, not to compete but to sidestep competition to gain control over supply chains at the expense of the farmer. Global evidence based on data from 61 countries between 2005-15, after all, suggests that farmers receive, on average, just 27% of consumer expenditure on foods consumed at home, the share falling significantly as national incomes rise. Digital consolidation route These fears of consolidation have been further stoked by recent memoranda of understanding that the Government of India has signed for building data stacks with Cisco, Jio, ITC, NeML, Ninjacart, Microsoft, Amazon, ESRI India Technologies, Star Agribazaar and Patanjali Organic Research Institute. While claiming to not involve private sector players, these select few have been granted limited access to “data from the federated Farmers’ database” for specific areas. This, it seems, might be the thin edge of a wedge. A “trade” area under full control of the central government would potentially offer big business a digital data consolidation route to controlling supply chains. The solution to the many problems of Indian agriculture and of Indian farmers was never going to be solved by the three farm laws, even within the realm of marketing. Nor is the repeal of these three Acts going to reverse or slow the rapid growth of private players in agricultural marketing in the past two decades, as seen by the 2019 Situation Assessment of Agricultural Households in India. What needs to be done The agricultural marketing space has seen significant reform in many States in the past decade, even if such reform has happened at a leisurely place and often piecemeal in its approach. While the Centre has the capacity to make landmark changes, true reform and action rests with local governments. States are better placed to assimilate and respond to the diversity of institutional and socio-economic contexts and agroclimatic regions. They are often better placed to incorporate local concerns for robust and sustainable solutions. The central national challenge is that different States have different regulations and a different pace of reform in part due to the political stakes involved in tackling trader collusion in these markets. States need to go back to the basics and to the suggestions that many expert committees have proposed for agricultural market reform — for a start, delinking the regulatory and operational roles of the APMCs. The Centre for its part should turn its attention in the short term to offering a stable and predictable policy environment vis-à-vis imports and exports, the functioning of national commodity exchanges and futures markets, and providing inclusive platforms for discussions on State-level market reform, public procurement and price support, designing safeguards against consolidation of corporate interests and framing data policies.

30 November 2021||November 30 2021 00:00 IST,||The many challenges before trade unions||The repeal of the three farm laws has set in motion expectations, if not talks, about the possible revival of other agitations, such as the one against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, and the repeal of the contentious Labour Codes passed in 2019-20. Trade unions have intensified their agitation against the Codes in the wake of the government’s decision to repeal the farm laws.  There were significant factors responsible for the farmers’ victory apart from the well-known political reasons for which the farm laws were repealed. In industrial or social conflicts, staying power, unflinching solidarity, political legitimacy, social visibility, and the capacity to inflict hurt to the opponents all matter in effecting favourable outcomes for the agitators. All these conditions characterised the farmers’ agitation. The protests enjoyed political legitimacy as the government had passed the three laws without consulting the farmers’ groups and had also not referred the laws to the Parliamentary Standing Committee (PSC). We need to assess the possible revival of the protests of the industrial workers for repeal of the Labour Codes while considering these aspects. Problems with the Codes The Central Trade Unions (CTUs) have criticised the Codes on three principal grounds. The Labour Codes were passed with little debate and discussion as the Opposition parties had staged a boycott in the Lok Sabha then. Trade unions, including the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), criticised the Central government for not holding adequate consultations with them on the Codes contrary to the government’s claims. The absence of effective dialogue contradicts the International Labour Organization treaty, the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention of 1976 (C.144), which India had ratified in February 1978. The Labour Codes contain many clauses that deprive labourers of hard-won labour rights. The Codes merit repeal for other major reasons as well. The drafting is shoddy and incomplete. The Codes are an insult to the collective legal and industrial relations intelligence in the country. The government introduced changes in major contentious clauses (hire and fire, contract labour) which were not based on robust empirical evidence; diluted good clauses (standing orders and inspections); made matters unduly complex (industrial tribunal, minimum wages) and made promises that were not backed by credible systems (social security fund, universal minimum wages and social security). Liberalisation of thresholds relating to major legal aspects (contract labour, hire and fire, standing orders) and the act of retaining existing thresholds even after several decades (provident fund, medical insurance) would intensify informalisation of the workforce. The government has left many substantive and procedural clauses to the rule-making processes which result in considerable divergences as States frame different rules on the same subject. These will introduce chaos in the governance of industrial relations. As opposed to the success of farmers’ protests, the failure of the trade unions’ agitations in achieving their demands present a conundrum. In fact, there exists an organised consultative framework due to the aforementioned ILO Convention. Trade unions have a long history and most of them have political affiliations. Though declining, trade unions still command a claimed membership of 90-100 million, which includes unorganised workers. The CTUs claimed that 150 to 250 million workers participated in the recent countrywide strikes. If that is the case, they should have shaken the government and had the Codes repealed, which did not happen. So, what ails the industrial working class’s cause? Why strikes are unsuccessful The CTUs are divided thanks to their political affiliations. Out of the 12 major CTUs, 10 have been jointly spearheading agitations calling for the repeal of all four Codes while the BMS has been conducting its own limited agitation: it is fine with the Wage and Social Security Codes but demands “review” of the Industrial Relations and the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Codes. Again, thousands of enterprise-based unions lacking political consciousness do not always support the CTUs’ agitations. The claimed strikes resulted in symbolic acts of nominal consultations with the CTUs by the United Progressive Alliance or National Democratic Alliance governments. The reform mandate was always alive. Second, though the CTUs for long succeeded in blocking labour law reforms at the national level, substantial reforms of laws and inspections have happened at the regional level. Further, with the sly support of the government, employers have been able to achieve labour flexibility (the rampant contractualisation of the workforce) denied to them by formal laws. Hence, the Labour Codes matter less even if they are repealed. Third, though there are around 400 million unorganised and informal workers, they are scattered and not organised in a consolidated manner to mount significant political opposition and demand labour market securities. More informality thanks to labour reforms will further hurt unions’ agitational power. Fourth, unlike farmers, the industrial workers cannot organise longer and larger strikes as they would lose their jobs and wages. The presence of the huge army of underemployed or unemployed and informal workers weakens their bargaining power. At best, they can organise short protests. In short, their strikes do not hurt either the economy or the government. The failures of the Railway strike of 1974 and the Bombay textile workers’ strike of 1982-83 haunt the labour movement. Fifth, a larger labour reforms agenda comprising privatisation, flexible labour markets, etc. are supported and even pushed by global financial institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Many countries are witnessing labour reforms. Unions are fighting in essence against the neoliberal order for which they require intellectual sinews. Sixth, the four Codes were scrutinised by the PSC. It is another matter that the Codes did not reflect several of the PSC’s recommendations or included clauses not mentioned in the draft Bills sent to the PSC. These procedural deficiencies may not be perceived as stark as those related to the farm laws. Finally, the ‘hurt’ government and the powerful reform-lobbying interest groups would ensure that there would not be more rollbacks, including of the Codes. In the wake of these realities, unions must come up either with agitational strategies to hurt the electoral image and prospects of the government and economy and/or exploit the possibility of legally challenging the Codes as has been done in case of gig workers. The delay in implementing the Codes thanks to adverse economic conditions or possibly due to political factors can be a short-term consolation, if any. K.R.

30 November 2021||November 30 2021 00:00 IST,||A launch window for India as a space start-up hub||The great space race of the 20th century was kicked off by the Soviet Union’s launch of Sputnik in 1957. It was a competition between the world’s great powers, a test of their ideologies, which proved to be a synecdoche of the entire Cold War between the capitalist United States and the socialist Soviet Union. The space race is on again, but this time, private players are on the power field to take the next leap for mankind and democratise space usage to build commercial value. This has huge implications for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the space sector in India and is a promising venture for global investors. India, a very marginal player Last year, according to a report, the Government of India created a new organisation known as IN-SPACe (Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre) which is a “single window nodal agency” established to boost the commercialisation of Indian space activities. A supplement to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the agency promotes the entry of the Non-Government Private Entities (NGPEs) in the Indian space sector. The agency will also felicitate a swift on-boarding of private players in the sector through encouraging policies in a friendly regulatory environment and by creating synergies through already existing necessary facilities, the report says. Today, the space economy is a $440 billion global sector, with India having less than 2% share in the sector. This is despite the fact that India is a leading space-faring country with end-to-end capabilities to make satellites, develop augmented launch vehicles and deploy inter-planetary missions. While total early-stage investments in space technologies in FY21 were $68 billion, India was on the fourth place with investments in about 110 firms, totalling not more than $2 billion. The hurdles Another aspect to throw light on is the extensive brain drain in India, which has increased by 85% since 2005. This can be linked to the bottlenecks in policies which create hindrances for private space ventures and founders to attract investors, making it virtually non-feasible to operate in India. Currently, a report on a leading news portal says: the reason for the lack of independent private participation in space includes the absence of a framework to provide transparency and clarity in laws. The laws need to be broken down into multiple sections, each to address specific parts of the value chain and in accordance with the Outer Space Treaty (or the United Nations resolution, the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies). Dividing activities further into upstream and downstream space blocks will allow legislators to provide a solid foundation to products/services developed by the non-governmental and private sectors within the value chain, it adds. Licences, liability It says: “with the technicalities involved in the space business, timelines on licensing, issuance of authorisation and continuous supervision mechanism need to be defined into phases, like in France, where there are four obtainable licences in addition to case-by-case authorisation, with lack of clarity surrounding costs”. Another crucial aspect of space law is insurance and indemnification clarity, particularly about who or which entity undertakes the liability in case of a mishap. In several western countries with an evolved private space industry, there is a cap on liability and the financial damages that need to be paid. In fact, space operators are required to hold insurance of up to AUD$100 million under Australian space law. As a part of the system Currently, many of the private entities are involved in equipment and frame manufacturing, with either outsourced specifications or leased licences. However, to create value, Indian space private companies need to generate their intellectual property for an independent product or service (e.g. satellite-based broadband) with ISRO neither being their sole or largest customer nor providing them IP and ensuring buy-backs (which was how most suppliers in the Indian space ecosystem were born over the last three decades). This will help open the door to global markets. Mature space agencies such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States, China’s China National Space Administration (CNSA), and Russia’s Roscosmos (Roscosmos State Corporation for Space Activities) seek support from private players such as Boeing, SpaceX and Blue Origin for complex operations beyond manufacturing support, such as sending crew and supplies to the International Space Station. These companies have revolutionised the space sector by reducing costs and turnaround time with innovation and advanced technology. For such purposes, NASA and the CNSA award a part of their annual budget to private players. Until 2018, SpaceX was a part of 30 missions of NASA, getting over $12 billion under contract. India currently stands on the cusp of building a space ecosystem and with ISRO being the guiding body, India can now evolve as a space start-up hub for the world. The sector is in the embryonic stage where the possibilities are limitless with a scope to build a feasible business model. Already 350 plus start-ups such as AgniKul Cosmos, Skyroot Technologies, Dhruva Space and Pixxel have established firm grounds for home-grown technologies with a practical unit of economics. However, to continue the growth engine, investors need to look up to the sector as the next “new-age” boom and ISRO needs to turn into an enabler from being a supporter. To ensure that the sky is not the limit, investor confidence needs to be pumped up and for the same, clear laws need to be defined.

30 November 2021||November 30 2021 00:00 IST,||Boosting green hydrogen||Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently announced that India would aim for net-zero carbon emissions by 2070. The announcement was given credence by the country’s solar achievements since 2015. India is the only major economy whose policies and actions are on track to limit global average temperature rise below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, as envisioned in the Paris Agreement. India has a head start As of now, 75% of India’s energy demand is met by coal and oil, including imports. This is expected to increase. Therefore, the synergy between renewable energy and green hydrogen must be tapped to tackle the dependence on fossil fuel and take greater advantage of India’s solar capacity. Hydrogen — green hydrogen, in particular — is a crucial weapon in India’s arsenal to fight climate change as it improves the long-term energy storage capabilities of renewable energy. The simplest element in the periodic table is also the most promising solution to decarbonise sectors like cement, steel, and refineries. “Hydrogen can provide the lowest-cost decarbonization solution for over a fifth of final energy demand by mid-century — contributing a cumulated reduction of 80Gt of CO2 — and is thus an essential solution to reach the 1.5°C climate scenario,” read a recent statement from the Hydrogen Council. Several major economies which are adopting legislation to reduce carbon emissions are also catalysing global efforts towards transitions to green hydrogen. A low-carbon source of energy is required to generate hydrogen through electrolysis – the splitting of a water molecule into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen produced is coded with a colour, depending on the method of its production. While hydrogen generated through renewable energy sources is green, it is blue when the carbon generated from the process is captured and stored without dispersing it in the atmosphere. When the carbon is not captured, the generated hydrogen is labelled grey. Nearly 70% of the investments required to produce green hydrogen through electrolysis goes into generating renewable energy. With India’s solar capacity increasing nearly 3,000 times in less than a decade, the cost of solar energy has reached a low of Rs. 2 per kWh. This gives India a unique head start in scaling up the use of green hydrogen. India can reduce its carbon emissions and make a dent in its annual import bills by developing a value chain for hydrogen from its production to its diverse applications, including production technologies, storage, transport and distribution, infrastructure (ports, refuelling stations), vehicular applications, and electricity/gas grid. Solutions Government funding and long-term policies that attract private investments within the standards and a progressive compliance framework are essential to boost green hydrogen. Hydrogen’s cross-sectoral capabilities should be exploited according to each sector’s cost and ease of adoption. A few key sectors with low transition costs, such as refineries, fertilizers and natural gas, should be mandated to use hydrogen to bring down costs as part of near-term goals. New demand from steel, cement and road mobility should be mandated as part of medium-term goals. Heavy-duty vehicles should receive State and Central incentives. Shipping, aviation, energy storage and solutions towards power intermittency should be mandated to use green hydrogen in the long run. Enforcing time-bound mid- and long-term policies would inspire the private sector to invest more in green hydrogen and give the boost it requires in its nascent stages. India’s current grey hydrogen production is six million tonnes per annum, which is around 8.5% of global annual production. India should replace this with green hydrogen and reduce dependence on imported ammonia. It should aim to produce 4-6 million tonnes of green hydrogen per annum by the end of the decade and export at least 2 million tonnes per annum. India has already taken the first step with the Indian Oil Corporation floating a global tender to set up two green hydrogen generations units at the Mathura and Panipat refineries. At present, more than 30 countries have hydrogen road maps and over 200 large-scale hydrogen projects across the value chain. If all the projects come to fruition, total investments will reach $300 billion in spending by 2030. Governments worldwide have committed to more than $70 billion in public funding, according to Hydrogen Council, to develop a hydrogen economy. With its abundant and cheap solar energy, India has the upper hand to tap into these investments and lead global efforts in transitioning to green hydrogen.

30 November 2021||November 30 2021 00:00 IST,||Mismanaging the monsoon||The DMK government renamed Madras as Chennai in 1996. M.K. Stalin, who was Mayor then, rolled out a slew of schemes under his pet project, Singara Chennai (Beautiful Chennai). In 2000, the same government set up Tidel Park, an information technology park, which ushered in unprecedented as well as unregulated growth. Chennai has experienced two major floods since then: first in 2005 and then in 2015. In the 25 years since 1996, the AIADMK has ruled for 15 years, including at the time of the floods. Now that large parts of Chennai are inundated once again, there is a stand-off between the DMK and AIADMK. Chief Minister Stalin has accused the previous AIADMK government of pilfering money from the Smart City project, while the Leader of the Opposition, Edappadi K. Palaniswami, has demanded to know what Ma. Subramanian, now Health Minister and previously Mayor, did during his earlier tenure. Mr. Palaniswami has also claimed that stagnation of water has decreased thanks to his government’s efforts. The truth is that the responsibility for the sorry state of affairs lies with both DMK and AIADMK governments. It naturally rests to a large extent with the AIADMK government considering the time it spent in power. But the issue is being seen as one of political vendetta/upmanship. While relentless industrial development, including the expansion of ports and thermal power plants, could be one of the main reasons for the floods in the northern parts of Chennai, as activists say, it is the aspirational housing projects of the middle class in the southern parts that have destroyed water bodies and blocked channels. As a consequence, there is less space for the water to naturally flow into the sea. Only now has the government realised the need to act on climate change despite scientists warning us decades ago that rainfall patterns are changing from long-drawn-out spells to shorter, intense spells, thus necessitating a change in urban planning. The AIADMK government dropped the Singara Chennai plan. It could have created a Greater Chennai to cater to the needs of the people on East Coast Road, the IT Expressway and the GST Road that connects the south, but it failed to do so. For two decades, the second airport project has been on paper. The Bus Rapid Transport System remains a report. The IT Expressway awaits a Metro. Clearly, there is a lack of vision in urban planning. The bureaucracy is also to blame for this. The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority has largely turned a blind eye to massive violations of building plans and FSI norms in core business districts. Despite 50 years of Dravidian rule that has propelled the State on several fronts, the city’s rivers — Adyar and Cooum — hold the mirror to the failure of successive governments. Former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa was known to be unapproachable. Allegations surfaced after the 2015 floods that the delay in reaching her was also one of the factors responsible for the severity of the floods. After her demise, with no elected representatives in the urban local bodies, the bureaucracy governed urban spaces under the guidance of Minister S.P. Velumani. He is being probed now by the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption. It is no wonder that the city’s civic infrastructure is in tatters. The present DMK government must also take some of the blame. It has failed to desilt water bodies and drains ahead of the monsoon and also to foresee the extent of flooding, including in core areas like T. Nagar. Chennai has recorded more than 1,000 mm of rain in a month four times in the last century. Three of these times have occurred in the last 16 years. This is clearly a wake-up call to the administration to rethink urban planning and development. aravind.b@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/mismanaging-the-monsoon/article37762887.ece
30 November 2021||November 30 2021 00:00 IST,||Regulation, not ban||Eight years after the RBI issued its first advisory cautioning holders of virtual currencies about the potential financial and security risks, and two years after drafting a Bill to ban cryptocurrencies, the Government is set to introduce legislation that would, if passed, officially proscribe such currencies. Its concerns appear to be the risks associated with cryptocurrencies, including their potential use for money-laundering and financing of illegal activities. The risks investors and consumers face in dealing with these so-called currencies, given that they are neither ‘a store of value nor are they a medium of exchange’, and the ostensible threat they pose to financial stability, are also key factors. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had in a video address to the Sydney Dialogue earlier this month said: “It is important that all democratic nations work together on this [cryptocurrency] and ensure it does not end up in wrong hands.” The Centre and the RBI’s deep disquiet with cryptocurrencies notwithstanding, there has been an exponential jump in investment in virtual currencies, especially after the Supreme Court last year struck down an RBI notification barring financial entities from facilitating customer transactions related to virtual currencies. Industry estimates now peg cryptocurrency holdings in India at about Rs. 40,000 crore, held by about 15 million investors, and advertising trends show an upsurge in ads promoting brands associated with investment in virtual currencies. That the ground has shifted since an Inter-Ministerial Committee set up to study the issues related to virtual currencies first proposed the ban in 2019 is beyond doubt. From the emphatic assertion in that panel’s report that “no country across the world treats virtual currencies as legal tender” to a situation where earlier this year El Salvador — admittedly a small and heavily indebted nation — officially declared ‘bitcoin’ as legal tender, much has changed in the adoption of private virtual currencies worldwide. The pandemic has accentuated the global embrace of all things digital and investment in the technologies enabling cryptocurrencies including blockchain, appear to be no different. Canada, Japan and Thailand permit the use of virtual currencies as a payment method, with some jurisdictions regulating them as a digital asset, and others as a commodity. Canada and the U.S. closely monitor virtual currency activity to ensure they do not run afoul of laws on financial crimes, with the former also earning tax revenue on transactions. All things given, India should eschew the temptation to join China in proscribing virtual currencies and instead aim to tightly regulate their trading through monitored exchanges and earn revenue. Simultaneously, it should expedite the RBI’s pilot of the Central Bank Digital Currency so as to offer an alternative to cryptocurrencies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/regulation-not-ban/article37762869.ece
30 November 2021||November 30 2021 00:00 IST,||Mixed colours||For the first time in 16 years, Germany will have a Social Democrat as Chancellor with three parties from opposite ends of the political spectrum agreeing to form a coalition that will end the era of Angela Merkel. In the run-up to the elections, not many expected that Olaf Scholz, leader of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) that is a junior partner in Ms. Merkel’s coalition, would succeed her. The SPD, Germany’s oldest political party that placed itself as a centrist platform with a focus on social security measures, has faced an identity crisis of sorts as Ms. Merkel emerged as the country’s quintessential centrist leader. On the other side, a relatively new leftist party, Die Linke, ate into the SPD’s traditional leftist base. This year’s election, whose main theme was to pick Ms. Merkel’s successor, opened political opportunities. While Ms. Merkel’s conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) tried to turn the Chancellor’s popularity into votes with the message of continuity, the SPD, under Mr. Scholz, who is the Finance Minister in the outgoing government, promised incremental reforms, including higher spending, while not completely disowning Ms. Merkel’s legacy. Results showed that he was more successful than his contenders in persuading reluctant voters. After taking a narrow lead over the CDU, the SPD started coalition talks with the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) to form a ‘traffic light’ coalition (named after the colours of the parties). The pace and the discipline with which the parties announced the coalition suggest that they are serious about forming a stable government. Each party has gained and conceded something in the coalition agreement. The SPD got the green light for its proposal to raise minimum wages from about €10 to €12 an hour. It has also proposed to build some 400,000 housing units to cool the housing market. The parties also agreed to phase out the use of coal for electricity production and increase the share of renewables to 80%, by 2030. In return for the FDP’s support for their spending and climate agenda, the Social Democrats and Greens agreed not to raise taxes. While the coalition agreement clears the way for government formation, it does not mean that governance would be smooth for Mr. Scholz. He lacks Ms. Merkel’s popularity and has to lead a diverse coalition that was formed based on convenience and compromise rather than any ideological commonality. Germany also faces economic, political and geopolitical challenges — from the COVID-19 crisis to cracks in the EU and challenges emanating from an aggressive Russia. His success as an administrator would depend on his ability to balance the competing agenda of the three parties and to putforward a common governance programme for Germany.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/mixed-colours/article37762870.ece

It has been confirmed after a full tally of the enemy losses in the tank battle at Boyra on November 21 that actually 14 Pakistani tanks — and not 13 as announced earlier — had been either destroyed or captured intact, and that three of them which had been abandoned by the fleeing Pakistanis had been recovered in good condition. In the fighting now going on in the last three days in the Balurghat-Hilli area, Pakistan has lost four more — three on Saturday and one on Sunday — bringing the total Pakistani losses so far to 18, roughly one-fifth of the tanks they have deployed in these two sectors. The Indian forces have not lost any in these two battles, although one of the tanks got bogged down in the Boyra area held by the Multi Bahini and it has since been brought back and put into operational condition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/border-clashes-in-east/article37762880.ece

In June 2019, auditors raised several red flags around Reliance Capital’s fourth-quarter results, including a lack of clarity in accounting methodology. The company has since then failed to make several debt obligation payments. The RBI’s move against Reliance Capital follows a similar step taken against Srei Infrastructure Finance Ltd. and Srei Equipment Finance Ltd. earlier this year.

30 November 2021||MUMBAI,||‘Realty markets in South outdo northern, western counterparts’||Realty markets in the South have done relatively well as compared with rest of India’s key markets on account of limiting new projects, focus on completion of delayed ones, and designing projects that met consumer demand, analysts said. This approach has been in contrast to most markets, where developers are confronted with massive inventory pile-ups, as opposed to the situation in the southern markets, they added. “The three main Southern cities collectively have less unsold stock than their western and northern counterparts,” said Santhosh Kumar, vice chairman, Anarock Group. For instance, Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad together have a total unsold stock of nearly 1.57 lakh units as of Q3 2021-end, according to Anarock Research. This is approximately 24% of the total unsold stock (of more than 6.55 lakh units) across the top 7 cities. In contrast, in the north, Delhi-NCR has more unsold stock of 1.67 lakh units (which is 25% of the overall share) while the western region including MMR and Pune have more than 2.9 lakh unsold units as of Q3 2021-end, which is 44% of the total unsold stock. “This clearly indicates that the southern markets are more in line with consumer demand,” Mr. Kumar said. “The property markets in Delhi NCR, Mumbai and Pune failed to match the performance of Southern real estate markets as most projects there got stalled due to extensive lockdowns during the second COVID wave,” said Debayan Bhattacharya, Head – Primary Sales (South Zone), Square Yards.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/realty-markets-in-south-outdo-northern-western-counterparts/article37762850.ece

The index hit a fresh high of 114.5 in the week ending November 28, with mobility returning to almost pre-pandemic levels, Nomura research analysts Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi said in a note on the latest print of the metric that considers February 23, 2020 as the base date for measuring post-COVID-19 activity. In the previous week, the Index stood at 113.4. “Google workplace and retail & recreation mobility rose by 3.6 percentage points and 1.6 percentage points [pp], respectively, while the Apple driving index eased marginally by 0.5pp. The labour participation rate improved to 40.5% from 39.8% in the prior week, while power demand recovered by 1.2% week-on-week from 0.2%,” they said. Despite the uncertainty due to the Omicron variant, Nomura said high-frequency data suggests the economy remains on a recovery path and inflationary pressures are building up. It, however, expressed concern about the extent of the fully-vaccinated population in India and its impact on contact-intensive sectors’ recovery. “Tourism is a relatively small share of the economy but continued normalisation of domestic contact-intensive services is contingent on infection cases remaining low, as only around 32% of the population are fully vaccinated,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/economic-activity-hits-fresh-post-covid-high-nomura/article37762854.ece

The net collection between April 1 - November 23 in 2020-21 and 2019-20 fiscals was more than Rs. 4.12 lakh crore and over Rs. 5.44 lakh crore, respectively. The gross direct tax collection (before adjusting refunds) as of November 23 stood at more than Rs. 8.15 lakh crore, a 48.11% growth over collections a year earlier. Mr. Chaudhary further said gross GST collection in the current fiscal (April 2021-March’22) post COVID-19 outbreak is showing an increasing trend. Gross GST collection for the year ended March 2021 was more than Rs. 11.36 lakh crore, while the same in the current fiscal till October stood at Rs. 8.10 lakh crore. In reply to a question on whether incidents of tax evasion are increasing in Delhi and other parts of the country, he said there was no evidence to suggest the trend. “In terms of cases detected under Goods & Service Tax (GST) and Customs, there is no increasing trend in such evasion noticed in Delhi; although, there is overall increase in detection of GST and Customs evasion cases in the country,” Mr. Chaudhary added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/net-direct-tax-revenue-rose-68-till-november-23-mos/article37762864.ece

30 November 2021||KANPUR,||Ravindra, Ajaz play out of their skin to deny India||A wicketless pre-lunch session, a flurry of wickets on either side of the tea interval and the incredible defiance from New Zealand’s last-wicket pair, India saw it all unfold with mixed emotions at the Green Park Stadium here. Eventually, two players of Indian origin — debutant Rachin Ravindra and Ajaz Patel — kept New Zealand’s pride intact. They walked away after denying the dreaded spin trio of R. Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel for 52 deliveries on a deteriorating pitch to pull off a thrilling draw on Monday. Memorable knock Ravindra and Ajaz, the two left-arm spinners were required to bring out their batting skills to save New Zealand from going one-down in the two-match series. What made Ravindra’s debut so memorable was the way he batted for 91 deliveries. His batting sessions in spin-friendly conditions in Bengaluru during his India visits could not have paid off at a better time. Last-man Ajaz, who was not very impressive with the ball, played his part to perfection by consuming 23 balls and contributed significantly to the eventual result. Though light was in question, India bowled its quota of 94 overs but could not find the final wicket. For forcing a draw, New Zealand gained four points in the World Test Championship race. India, too, gained four but, more significantly, lost eight for drawing as host. For the better part of the day, draw looked the most probable result after Tom Latham and night-watchman William Somerville batted out the first session by adding 75 runs. Latham, the mainstay of the first innings, replayed the role by displaying his skills in dealing with the spinning deliveries. Somerville surprised the Indians with the ease with which he stayed firm. In fact, he found the ropes five times — two more than what Latham managed! Somerville’s departure to the first ball after lunch brought in Kane Williamson and the third-wicket stand produced 39 runs but more importantly, consumed 19.1 overs. However, India went on to collect eight wickets in the space of 76 runs. This did not come as a surprise since India scalped nine wickets for 99 runs in the first innings. But, despite flattering bowling figures, the spin trio fell just short of finding the match-winning wicket. Vital blows Showing the kind of intensity associated with him, Ashwin threw everything at the Kiwi batters and struck vital blows. With Latham’s wicket, Ashwin (418 wickets) displaced Harbhajan Singh (417) as the third highest Indian wicket-taker in Tests behind Anil Kumble (619) and Kapil Dev (434). Jadeja bowled more effectively than Axar on this day. Jadeja troubled the batters with his faster deliveries that skidded through. Axar, unlike in the first innings, could not find the desired angle when bowling from the edge of the crease. A disappointed India and a delighted New Zealand now travel to Mumbai. Virat Kohli will return as skipper, but it remains to be seen how India deals with the poor form of its top-order batters.  India’s highestwicket-takers Kumble (619 in 132 Tests) Kapil (434 in 131) Ashwin (419 in 80) Harbhajan (417 in 103) Ishant (311 in 105) Zaheer (311 in 92)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rachin-ajaz-play-out-of-their-skin-to-deny-india/article37763118.ece
30 November 2021||Bali,||Satwik-Chirag qualify for BWF Finals||The World No. 11 doubles pair of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty has become the first Indian men’s doubles pair to qualify for the season-ending BWF World Tour Finals starting here on Wednesday. Satwik and Chirag had lost in the semifinals of the Indonesia Open last week but made the cut after the Japanese pair of Akira Koga and Taichi Saito also lost in the last four at the Super 1000 tournament. The Indians thus leapfrogged the Japanese in the ‘Road to Bali’ to book the berth at the year-ending event. “Fell short in the end against Kevin/Marcus today. But nevertheless happy with the way we played this week. On the positive side we have qualified for the World Tour Finals!” Chirag wrote on his Instagram page. Earlier, Lakshya Sen had become the youngest Indian to qualify for the $1.5 million tournament, which will also see K. Srikanth, P.V. Sindhu and the women’s doubles pair of Ashwini Ponnappa and N. Sikki Reddy in action. Srikanth, Sameer Verma, Sindhu and London bronze- medallist Saina Nehwal have competed in the year-ending tournament in the past. While Sindhu is the only Indian to win the BWF World Tour Finals in 2018, Saina had reached the summit clash of the BWF Superseries Finals in 2011. Srikanth and Sameer have made it to the knockout stages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/satwik-chirag-qualify-for-bwf-finals/article37763163.ece
30 November 2021||Coimbatore,||CBA’s request for better facilities||Coimbatore has been producing quality shuttlers, who have left their stamp of class at the National-level. But sadly, for a year, these stars who want to make it big leave the city and the State for advanced training facilities. Hurting CBA This has been hurting the Coimbatore Badminton Association (CBA) for some time now as it is losing these precious gems despite its best efforts. The CBA addressed the issue with the Coimbatore District Collector Dr. G.S. Sameeran and presented a proposal requesting the State government for advanced training facility, during the TN State U-19 badminton championship at the RaK’s Sports Arena here on Sunday.  Sameeran, who witnessed the final day clashes, was surprised with the wealth of talent and promised to extend all support before the city loses more such players. “Coimbatore is the second largest city after Chennai to have the maximum number of players representing the State at the nationals. Despite that, we do not have advanced government training facilities in our city. Most of our players depend on private facilities,” said CBA secretary Swetha Krishnamurthy. “It is not sufficient enough to have a crack at the international level. “So, the CBA, along with the TNBA, have requested for a state-of-the-art 16-court facility to meet the needs of the players,” she added. Sathish Kumar, who won three international medals at the senior level recently, is one such player who left the city to train in Bengaluru. The CBA took the opportunity to reward him for his effort with a cheque for Rs. 1 lakh, which was presented by Sameeran on the final day of the State championship.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/cbas-request-for-better-facilities/article37763277.ece
30 November 2021||Bloemfontein,||Second ‘A’ Test to go ahead||Cooped up in a bio-bubble while a new COVID-19 variant causes panic all around, the India-A cricket team will take on South Africa-A in the second ‘Test’ from Tuesday. The first four-day game ended in a draw due to inclement weather on Friday last week even as the Omicron variant forced many countries to impose restrictions on travel to South Africa. The uncertain situation also led to the Netherlands abandoning its last two ODIs scheduled in Johannesburg. However, India-A stayed put in Bloemfontein inside a bio-bubble. The matches are being played without spectators and the India senior team is also due to arrive in the country by December 9. If the situation deteriorates, it can jeopardise the tour which involves three Tests, three ODIs and four T20Is across four venues — Johannesburg, Centurion, Paarl, and Cape Town. However, the India-A players will need to keep the thoughts of the new variant at bay and focus on the task on hand. In the first game, the India-A batters — namely Abhimanyu Easwaran, skipper Priyank Panchal and Prithvi Shaw — did quite well. However, the bowling is an area of concern as the hosts piled up a big total.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/second-a-test-to-go-ahead/article37763110.ece
30 November 2021||Mumbai,||Franchises face the retention conundrum||The eight existing Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises will submit their player-retention list on Tuesday for the next edition. They are allowed to retain a maximum of four, while the two new franchises — Lucknow and Ahmedabad — can acquire three from the rest of the player pool before the January auction.  Sportstar spoke to several franchises about what the probable retention list could look like.  Delhi Capitals: Capitals look certain to retain current skipper Rishabh Pant, Prithvi Shaw, and Axar Patel. Among overseas players, the franchise is expected to opt for Anrich Nortje over Kagiso Rabada.   Mumbai Indians: The five-time champion side is expected to retain captain Rohit Sharma and pace ace Jasprit Bumrah. Among the overseas recruits, Kieron Pollard is likely to be preferred, while there could be a toss-up between Suryakumar Yadav and Ishan Kishan. The Pandya brothers — Hardik and Krunal — will head to the auction pool, unless the Ahmedabad franchise picks one or both of them.   Chennai Super Kings: M.S. Dhoni remains the captain of the team, while Ravindra Jadeja and Ruturaj Gaikwad should be retained too. Moeen Ali could be the preferred overseas all-rounder.   Punjab Kings: The team could retain Mayank Agarwal and Ravi Bishnoi. There could be a toss-up between the seasoned Mohammed Shami and the young gun Arshdeep Singh. With K.L. Rahul set to move to one of the new franchises — possibly Lucknow — the franchise remains undecided on its foreign retention.   Kolkata Knight Riders: All eyes will be on Eoin Morgan. While there is a buzz that Knightriders might eventually not retain him, his success in IPL 2021 could force the side to change its mind. Among the Indians, the franchise could opt for Venkatesh Iyer, Shubman Gill, or Varun Chakravarthy. Among the overseas players, Sunil Narine is set to continue.   Rajasthan Royals: Sanju Samson will remain the captain, while the franchise could opt for Yashasvi Jaiswal or Chetan Sakariya. Jos Buttler is likely to be retained as one of the overseas picks. And the franchise might keep either Ben Stokes or Jofra Archer ahead of an Indian player.   Royal Challengers Bangalore: Virat Kohli, Glenn Maxwell and Mohammed Siraj are certain to be retained. The fourth player could be Harshal Patel who had a good India debut following a memorable IPL 2021.   Sunrisers Hyderabad: Only Kane Williamson is likely to be retained as Rashid Khan is understood to be in touch with one of the other franchises. Abdul Samad could be the lone Indian retained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/franchises-face-the-retention-conundrum/article37763116.ece
30 November 2021||November 30 2021 00:00 IST,||Chhangte, Thapa star for CFC||A goal each from Lallianzuala Chhangte and Anirudh Thapa on either side of the break helped Chennaiyin FC beat NorthEast United FC 2-1 in an Indian Super League match at Fatorda on Monday. In a hard-fought match, two moments of individual brilliance gave CFC its second win in as many matches. NEUFC, as indicated by assistant coach Alison Kharsyntiew at a media interaction on Sunday, started positively and dominated possession in the opening 30 minutes. Damjanovic’s tackle  NEUFC had a golden chance in the 20th minute when Federico Gallego set up Mathias Coureur, who had just the goalkeeper to beat. However, CFC defender Slavko Damjanovic made a sliding tackle to save his side. In the 41st minute, Chhangte latched on to a deflection off a NorthEast player and slammed home from the edge of the box. The ball hit the crossbar before finding the back of the net and giving CFC the lead. However, NEUFC drew level immediately after the break when Mashoor Shereef’s superb throw-in was headed home by Suhair VP. CFC goalkeeper Vishal Kaith, who reacted late, charged towards the ball and missed it completely, allowing Suhair to score. CFC slowly got back into the groove. In the 74th minute, Thapa cashed in on an assist from Mirlan Murzaev with a brilliant first touch to send the NEUFC ’keeper one way before drilling home the winner.  The result: NorthEast United FC 1 (Suhair 50) lost to Chennaiyin FC 2 (Chhangte 41, Thapa 74).

30 November 2021||November 30 2021 00:00 IST,||Upbeat Odisha FC meets struggling SC East Bengal||Odisha FC will look to build on its win against former champion Bengaluru FC when it takes on a struggling SC East Bengal in an ISL Season 8 fixture at the Tilak Maidan, Vasco, on Tuesday. Odisha, which had failed to make an impression in the previous edition, started with a comfortable 3-1 win over Bengaluru FC. Goals from Spanish midfielder Javi Hernandez and striker Aridai Cabrera ensured that Odisha made the most of the opportunities despite not having a greater share of ball possession. “The strategy is to remain competitive. In the end, we cannot live in the last game which was good for us. “Our thought now is to compete in the best way possible in the next,” said Odisha FC head coach Kiko Ramirez ahead of the match. East Bengal is smarting from a 0-3 loss to traditional rival ATK Mohun Bagan in the previous round. The Kolkata giant is yet to register a win, posing a big challenge to new head coach Manolo Diaz. “It will be a very important match against Odisha as we would like to gain the full three points. We will try be very focused on the task ahead and not think about our loss or Odisha’s win in the last match,” said Diaz.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/upbeat-odisha-fc-meets-struggling-sc-east-bengal/article37763300.ece
30 November 2021||Kollam,||Ajay defeats Govind, keeps crown||Defending champion Ajay Satish Kumar Nair (Thiruvananthapuram) and the unseeded Anaswara Ajai (Ernakulam) won the men’s and women’s singles titles respectively in the State senior badminton championships here on Monday. Ajay, who is unseeded here for having skipped the ranking tournaments this season, packed off the joint third seed K. Govind (Kozhikode) 21-14, 21-17 to retain the title. Ajay’s superior court coverage and a tight defensive game put him in good stead against an erratic Govind. After a cagey start Ajay raced away to take a decisive seven point lead in the first set and won it 21-14. Ajay also blended deception with aggression to catch his rival napping. Fighting hard However, Govind staged a fine rally midway when he came back from 10-14 to equalise the scores at 14 in the second set. Govind led 17-16 before Ajay regained his touch to reel off five consecutive points to win the set and match. Anaswara continued her giant killing act by toppling top seed Pavithra Jayaraj (Pathanamthitta) 21-18, 8-21, 21-18 in the women’s final. The taller Pavithra used her reach well to cover the angles, but Anaswara was relentless from the back court keeping the shuttle in play longer to frustrate her rival. Anaswara exploited Pavithra’s weakness at the net to nail crucial points. Pavithra ran out of steam in the third set as Anaswara mixed her shots to move the top seed around. The tiring Pavithra committed a few unforced errors as Anasawara took a 19-13 lead. Though Pavithra saved three match points she couldn’t stop Anaswara from winning her maiden senior title.  The results (finals): Men: Ajay Satish Kumar Nair (Tvm) bt K. Govind (Koz) 21-14, 21-17.   Mixed doubles: Aravind V. Suresh & Nayana S. Oasis bt Sangeeth Das & Zainaba Reem Siraj 21-17, 21-14.

30 November 2021||KOZHIKODE,||Tamil Nadu hits 20 past Telangana||Tamil Nadu is the State to watch out for now in Indian women’s football. On Monday morning at the Govt. Medical College Ground, that is mostly what Telangana did — watch. Tamil Nadu, the winner in 2018, won by a staggering margin of 20-0 to open its campaign the National senior women’s football championship. Sandhiya accounted for eight of those goals, while M. Saritha scored four and M. Malavika and Durga three each.

30 November 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||India will be at its best against Belgium: Araijeet||Seventeen-year-old striker-cum-drag-flicker Araijeet Singh Hundal says the Indian players understand the importance of maintaining their energy level in the quarterfinal against Belgium in the Junior World Cup here on Wednesday. Hundal said his team would give its best in the last-eight match. Learning from errors “I feel we took our first match (against France) too lightly, but have learnt from our mistakes. We are fully charged up for the quarterfinals against Belgium. We had a meeting, especially for forwards, today and we know even one small mistake or slight drop in energy will cost us dearly. We are totally focused on playing our ‘A’ game,” said Araijeet. Araijeet, who has scored five goals including a hat-trick, underscored the importance of the JWC. “I was just 12 when the 2016 JWC was held in Lucknow. I don’t know much about that tournament. But I am aware of how that tournament changed many players’ lives,” he said. The Amritsar boy, whose father Kuljeet Singh is a former Railways player, was quick on his feet as a forward but his drag-flicking skills improved following his consultations with senior India players when the National camp resumed in September 2020. “My interactions with Rupinderpal and Harmanpreet were very helpful. They said my technique was good, but I needed to pay more attention to my footwork and ball release. I worked a lot on my timing, power and shoulder movement after coming to the camp. Useful advice “Varun Kumar told me to keep my head up and look more confident while taking the drag-flick. Another crucial advice the seniors gave me was to study the opponent goalkeeper’s weaknesses. During the lockdown, our coach (B.J. Kariappa) would also share videos of the senior team drag-flickers on our Whatsapp group so that we could study their movement and implement necessary changes to our game. I feel all these factors have helped a lot,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-will-be-at-its-best-against-belgium-araijeet/article37763175.ece
30 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||I thank Chandra sir for guiding me: Ramkumar||The maiden Challenger singles title has come at the right time for the 27-year-old Ramkumar Ramanathan, who has matured into an all-court player. Ramkumar, who shot to World No. 186 and No.1 in the country after he beat Evgeny Karlovskiy of Russia 6-1, 6-4 in the final, was grateful, especially to coach T. Chandrasekaran for his constant guidance. “At this moment, I thank Chandra sir for guiding me all the way. We spoke before each match and it really helped me stay focused. He made me believe in myself and in my resources during every match. I thank God for keeping me healthy,” said Ramkumar after the triumph in Bahrain. Based in Chennai, Chandrasekaran, who has coached Ramkumar from his childhood, summed up nicely about the level of tennis his ward was demonstrating for his successful journey on the professional tour. “Ram has excellent on-court resources. I have always advised him to play to his strengths. He has a huge forehand, big first and second serve, good backhand and penetrative volleys. Ram can mix up according to the demands of the situation. He raised his level of aggression when required and his confidence grew with every match,” said coach Chandra. More than anything, the coach was pleased that, “Ram is physically fit and mentally very strong. “He will have bigger wins in the coming days. Ram showed there was no dearth of fighting abilities as he found ways from tricky positions to win. “Ram played remarkably well when he was down. He broke his opponent’s serve and got back into the match and won. The whole week he served well,” said the coach. Aces galore Ramkumar served 62 aces in five matches and 45 of them were from the quarterfinals to the finals. He converted 17 of 27 break points in five matches, of which two went to three sets. He dropped serve only five times the whole week in singles, as he saved 15 break points in all. After losing six Challenger finals over the years, Ramkumar was delighted with the maiden title. He expressed his gratitude to coach Emilio Sanchez and the Sanchez Academy for “always helping me”. He was also thankful to his employer, Indian Oil Corporation “for their continuous support”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/i-thank-chandra-sir-for-guiding-me-ramkumar/article37763179.ece
30 November 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Tirkey prescribes tighter defence||Former India captain Dilip Tirkey prescribes a tighter defence and a careful approach for the Indian colts in their crucial quarterfinal match on Wednesday against Belgium in the Junior World Cup here on Wednesday. Tirkey, a well-known defender in his time, told The Hindu on Monday: “We need to be more organised in defence. “Belgium is one of the top teams and runner-up of the last edition. We cannot afford a loose defence.” “We must avoid wrong passing and should not give Belgium chances to counterattack. We need to be alert for long passes and the aerial ball. We have to intercept those to deny the opponent any advantage,” he said. Looking back at India’s pool matches, Tirkey said, “France played better than us and showed it is a fit team with a process in place. France played well for three quarters, while we played well in one. Canada and Poland did not put much pressure, yet these matches were good practice opportunities. “Our confidence must be up after two wins. We have some quality players. Our penalty corner conversion has been good and we need to focus more on getting field goals,” he said. Tirkey, who was rarely booked during his long career, had a word of caution for the host. “In the last match, we got a few cards. We have to be careful as suspension affects the structure on the field. Such mistakes may prove very costly against stronger sides,” said Tirkey.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tirkey-prescribes-tighter-defence/article37763405.ece

30 November 2021||MANCHESTER,||Rangnick appointed interim United coach||German coach Ralf Rangnick was hired Monday as Manchester United manager until the end of the season. The 63-year-old Rangnick has left his role as head of sports and development at Russian club Lokomotiv Moscow to take charge of the English club, which has been led by former player Michael Carrick since the firing of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on Nov. 21. United is planning to hire a permanent manager in the offseason, at which time Rangnick will take up a “consultancy role for a further two years," the club said. The arrival of Rangnick, a pioneer of the high-intensity pressing game developed in Germany and increasingly dominant in world soccer over the last decade, should shake up the playing style of United as the team looks to rescue its season. “The squad is full of talent and has a great balance of youth and experience,” Rangnick said. “All my efforts for the next six months will be on helping these players fulfil their potential, both individually and, most importantly, as a team.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ralf-rangnick-named-united-coach/article37763176.ece
30 November 2021||KOCHI,||Neeraj’s South Africa trip cancelled||With the new Omicron variant of COVID-19 spreading fear all over, Neeraj Chopra’s training trip to South Africa has now been cancelled. The plan was to send the Olympic javelin champion to South Africa on December 2 and he was supposed to stay there till March next year. But the highly transmissable Omicron variant, first detected in that country, has forced the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) to quickly change its plans. “Neeraj’s South Africa trip has been cancelled. We are trying to send him to the US,” chief National coach Radhakrishnan Nair told The Hindu from Patiala on Monday. “The AFI will decide as soon as possible.”  With next year loaded with many majors, including the World Championships (July 14-24, Oregon, USA), Commonwealth Games (July 28-Aug. 8, Birmingham, England) and Asian Games (Sept. 10-25, Hangzhou, China), the original plan was to bring Neeraj from his foreign training base to India for National competitions in March and then send him to Europe for training and competitions again. But, with a few countries suspending flights and others planning stricter checking and quarantine, flying could be a headache all over again.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/neerajs-south-africa-trip-cancelled/article37763162.ece

30 November 2021||KANPUR,||Terrific game: Williamson||Having denied India the victory it sniffed in the final session, Kane Williamson and his gallant men have reasons to be pleased with their show. On the other hand, Ajinkya Rahane could point to the way India battled from 51 for five in the second innings and struck late to come so close to victory. Overall, the first Test here was a good advertisement for Test cricket, with 94 overs bowled on the final day before the last-wicket pair walked away unconquered. “Terrific game overall,” was how Williamson saw it. “It was also some fantastic experience for Rachin (Ravindra), Ajaz (Patel) and William (Somerville),” said the skipper about the spin trio that was chosen after considering their ability to bat well in these conditions. “We know this Indian side is a very strong one. There are things to touch on. We have to prepare for a different kind of pitch in Mumbai,” said Williamson. Rahane said, “Very good game of cricket. They played really well. We came back really well after the first session.” Asked about the chat with the umpires at the end, he said, “It was about light. As a fielding team, you want to bowl more overs. As a batting unit, you don’t want to bat in that situation. The umpires made the call and I thought they were right.” Ashwin said, “We knew if we had the time to go on and put some pressure on them, we could get the job done. There has been bad light on every single day of this Test match so we did expect it.” Dravid’s gesture India's new head coach Rahul Dravid gave the Green Park groundstaff, led by Shiv Kumar, Rs. 35,000 for preparing a sporting pitch for the first Test. “Rahul Dravid has paid Rs. 35,000 to our groundsmen,” the Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association (UPCA) announced after the game.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/terrific-game-williamson/article37763120.ece

30 November 2021||November 30 2021 00:00 IST,||An idli that impressed the Vice-President||Chittem Sudheer was in for a surprise last week. Busy serving millet idlis to a long queue of customers at Vasena Poli stall at Waltair Uplands, Visakhapatnam, Sudheer was taken aback when a special breakfast order came from the Vice-President of India. M. Venkaiah Naidu, who was on a visit to Visakhapatnam, took to Twitter after his meal. He wrote: “Had a sumptuous breakfast of millet idlis today made by ‘Vasena Poli’ stall run by a young agri-entrepreneur Chittem Sudheer in Visakhapatnam. With a rich flavour and taste, such millet based food offer a healthy and organic alternative to our diet... Such innovative efforts by our youth to go back to our traditional diet & lifestyle are commendable.’ The tweet quickly went viral. Wrapped in the vistharaku — which are dried leaves stitched together to make plates — Sudheer’s millet idlis are made with ragi (finger millet), jowar (sorghum millet), bajra (pearl millet), korra (foxtail millet), ooda (barnyard millet), aarika (kodo millet), saama (little millet) and variga (proso millet). The batter is poured into smallvistharakuleaf containers and steamed over fire. These conical idlies are served with three types of chutneys: groundnut, ginger and a mix of vegetables. What started off as a small home-based enterprise in 2018 has today turned into a well-loved city landmark. A postgraduate in agriculture economics, 28-year-old Sudheer launched his first food stall of Vasena Poli last year and has been on his toes ever since, catering to a rising demand for his millet idlis. “There is a greater awareness for shifting to millet-based food, especially after the pandemic,” he says. Every day, he gets more than 200 orders for his millet idlis and dosas. Now, his daily sales total about Rs. 15,000. His menu includes millet dosa, jowar roti with curry and millet cake (prepared with a mix of two or more millets). The dosas and curries are prepared with cold-pressed sesame oil. Stating that he recently switched to unpolished black urad dal to make his idlis and dosas more nutritious, Sudheer says he keeps tweaking recipes to ensure balance. “The right combination of millets provides holistic nutrition. Millets are full of anti-oxidants, vitamins, minerals and are also high on fibre content,” he says. Before embarking on his entrepreneurial journey, Sudheer spent time with the tribals in Srikakulam, studying organic farming practices and learning about traditional millets grown in the region. He collaborated with Acharya NG Ranga Agricultural University in Guntur, where he first experimented with idlis. Organic produce Sudheer gets nine varieties of millets from Paderu, a tribal belt in Visakhapatnam district and Parvathipuram in Vizianagaram district, where they are organically grown by the tribal farmers. Daily about 10 to 15 kilogram of millets are used to make the fresh batter. “We make the batter in two batches — once in the morning and once in the evening — so that it is fresh,” he says. The vistharaku leaf gives his idlis a unique flavour. “It also has antibacterial and antiseptic qualities,” says Sudheer. Given the rising demand for his idlis, he needs about 2,000 vistharaku leaves every alternate day from Paderu, which has become a challenge. “Rains have affected the production and supply of the leaves. Paderu is a remote region with limited network connectivity. There have been days when the leaves were out of stock and I could not open my stall,” he states. While innovation in millet-based food is a subject close to his heart, Sudheer also wants to support tribal farmers and organic agricultural practices. “I am in the process of bringing together the tribal farmers of Paderu to start and register as a Farmer Producer Company (a hybrid between cooperative societies and private limited companies) to get prices for their crops. The registration process will be done in January. I’m encouraging them to grow black pepper, groundnut, tamarind, red kidney bean, apart from millets.” Expansion plans With the national spotlight on him after the Vice-President’s tweet, Sudheer has been flooded with requests for expansion through the franchise route. “I eventually want to expand and take my enterprise to other cities. But I want to take it slow and keep my focus on quality control to build a brand,” he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/an-idli-that-impressed-the-vice-president/article37763484.ece
