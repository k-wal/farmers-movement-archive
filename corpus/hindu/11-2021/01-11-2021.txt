01 November 2021||MANGALURU,||CNG in short supply in city||The commissioning of the Kochi-Mangaluru Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) pipeline in January and the opening of six CNG (compressed natural gas) dispensing stations in February are yet to proliferate the use of cleaner, greener and cheaper fuel in Mangaluru for want of adequate supply. While commissioning the 450-km LNG pipeline on January 5, 2021, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said that the pipeline will herald a new growth, in the automobile, industrial and domestic fronts. Nine months after the commissioning, compressed natural gas availability for vehicles has remained limited to a very few vehicles. Yashwanth Kadri, who is in the road transport sector, said that he will see long queues of CNG-run vehicles waiting for fuel at the Kavoor dispensing station throughout the day. Many goods vehicles from Bengaluru and other areas running on CNG wait at the station to fill up, he said. The Dakshina Kannada District CNG Consumers Association recently voiced concern over the short supply of fuel and said that severe shortage was being witnessed after prices of diesel and petrol saw a steep increase. While several new factory-fitted CNG vehicles are on road, many others have opted for retro-fitting of CNG tanks to save on the cost of operation, while enhancing mileage. However, short supply of fuel has been a deterrent, it said. Sources in GAIL Gas Ltd., authorised distributor of LNG and CNG in Dakshina Kannada district, however, said that COVID-19 lockdown has slowed down laying of distribution pipes from the pumping stations at Arkula and MCF. Though CNG is being brought from Bengaluru through tankers, some of the dispensing outlets are yet to get additional power supply (35 kW) from Mangalore Electricity Supply Company (MESCOM), the sources said. A master supply station coming up at Baikampady is likely to get commissioned in a couple of months and the situation may improve, the sources said. MESCOM officials, however, said that there is no dearth of energy to be supplied to fuel dispensing stations. “We provide additional supply on demand and upon payment of the required deposit,” a senior engineer with the power distributor said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cng-in-short-supply-in-city/article37277555.ece
01 November 2021||New delhi,||No time-bound pacts on climate change at G-20||India pushed for “safeguarding the interests of the developing world” as Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the G-20 summit at sessions on climate change and sustainable development on Sunday, said G-20 Sherpa and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal. No time-bound agreements were reached as leaders of the world’s top economies ended the summit in Rome, recommitting to providing $100 billion a year to counter climate change, and pushing for greater vaccine equality to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. G-20 countries also committed to ending international financing for all new coal plants by the end of 2021, but made no mention of domestic commitments on ending coal power generation. The final communique, agreed upon after negotiations overnight, spoke only of the “key relevance of achieving global net zero” on carbon emissions “by or around mid-century”. Amongst the other highlights of the statement was a decision to pursue the recognition of more vaccines by the World Health Organization under a “One Health approach” for the world, and providing finances and technology for vaccine production at “mRNA Hubs” in South Africa, Brazil and Argentina, and to mobilise more international public private financing for “green” projects. Mr. Modi later described the summit as “fruitful”. Addressing the media, G-20 Sherpa and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal hailed the communique for acknowledging India’s concerns on climate justice.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/g-20-ends-without-time-bound-promise-on-climate-change/article37277161.ece
01 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Row over caste split of MGNREGA wage||For poor villagers in Rajasthan’s Ajmer district, a good Diwali depends on their wages from the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme, so tensions were high when some got paid faster than others for work done over the last six months. “These are people who did the work together, at the same worksite, for the same number of days. They were all on the same muster roll. But those from SC/ST [Scheduled Castes and Tribes] got paid within 15-20 days. Those from other communities had to wait two months,” said Karthik Singh, a coordinator with the Rajasthan Asangathit Mazdoor Union. “This caused a lot of worry that there was some gadbad (mess-up), and created suspicions and tensions among the villagers. Panchayat officials say they have submitted the details for everyone, but the order to split the payments by caste has come from higher up, so they cannot do anything.” Similar concerns have been raised by grassroots activists and union leaders in a number of States including Jharkhand, West Bengal, Bihar, Karnataka, Telangana and Tamil Nadu after a Central directive on March 2 this year to split MGNREGA budget for wage payments along caste lines . At a meeting with the Finance Secretary and Rural Development Ministry officials on October 11, the Social Justice Ministry and several State governments warned of “dissension”, “backlash” and threats to social harmony in villages being caused by the directive. “A decision was then taken to go back to a single muster and payment system,” said one of the officials who attended the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tensions-rise-over-caste-split-of-mgnrega-wages/article37277164.ece

The Republican Party of India firmly stands by him. Nawab Malik should stop hurling personal allegations against Mr. Wankhede and his family,” he said. Mr. Athawale was speaking after Mr. Wankhede’s wife, Kranti Redkar, and father, Dnyandev Kachru Wankhede, met him to seek his support. “Nawab Malik’s allegations have no basis. The name of Sameer Wankhede’s father is not Dawood. I have also seen all their documents… Malik’s allegations amount to defamation of the SC community,” he said. Mr. Malik had alleged that Mr. Wankhede was born a Muslim and he forged documents, including a caste certificate, to avail himself of the “recruitment under quota” benefits after clearing the Union Public Service Commission examination. Mr. Malik has been questioning Mr. Wankhede’s probe methods since he led a raid on a cruise ship on October 2 and claimed to have recovered drugs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/nawab-maliks-allegations-baseless/article37277347.ece

In a letter recovered by the family members, which was purported to have been written by the victim Asampally Mahesh and addressed to the Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, the former appealed to Mr. Rao to issue job notifications at least now so that more people like him will not end their lives in the State. “I completed my studies, but have failed to get a job. KCR sir, please issue job notification,” the letter reportedly cited. According to the police, Mahesh’s family members lodged a complaint stating that he ended his life allegedly due to financial problems. He was said to have spent the money handed over to him by depositors in a chit fund company where he was employed. On Saturday night around 11 p.m. he left home and did not return.

01 November 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||Farmers’ ‘maha padayatra’ begins today||A contingent of farmers from Amaravati is all set to embark on a 45-day ‘maha padayatra’ from Thullur in Guntur district to Tirumala on Monday to highlight the “adverse consequences” of splitting Amaravati into Legislative, Executive and Judicial capitals (Amaravati, Visakhapatnam and Kurnool respectively) for them personally and the State as a whole. The padayatra will pass through about 70 important villages in Guntur, Prakasam, Nellore and Chittoor districts, where the farmers will apprise the people of the alleged injustice being meted to them by the government in the name of decentralisation. The root cause of the protest is the passage of the A.P. Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions and the Capital Region Development Authority Repeal Acts in the Assembly last year in spite of stiff resistance from the farmers. Up to 100 petitions that challenged the three capitals are pending final adjudication by the State High Court from November 15. The Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi and the Amaravati Farmers’ JAC, which are jointly organising the padayatra, had to fight to obtain permission for it from the Police Department. It was only on the High Court’s directions that the police permitted the farmers to take out the padayatra, subject to certain conditions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/amaravati-farmers-maha-padayatra-begins-today/article37277166.ece

01 November 2021||New Delhi,||Congress MPs in Punjab weigh their options||As the political situation continues to unravel in Punjab, Members of Parliament may be trying to evaluate their response to the assertion of former Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh (retd.) that he is determined to float his own party. With more than two-and-a-half years left for the next Lok Sabha election, the decision may be easy for some while others may have a more difficult choice to make. Capt. Amarinder Singh’s wife and Lok Sabha member from Patiala is one such MP and so are Mohammad Sadique and Manish Tewari, both close to the former Punjab Chief Minister. With Punjab’s Hindu population between 38% and 40%, the BJP would be keen to have on board a Hindu face like Mr. Tewari to reach out to an urban Hindu electorate, including forward castes such as Brahmins. Any decision, however, is incumbent on the Centre resolving the issue of the three contentious farm laws to the satisfaction of the farmers’ unions. Sources told The Hindu that Capt. Amarinder Singh had reached out to some of his former colleagues. However, none is said to have committed to joining his party or the BJP. But independent of the Captain’s plans, leaders belonging to traditional Congress families are upset with the new order in Punjab, with Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi and PCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu being considered “newcomers” who have pipped the old guard. And this includes leaders like Partap Singh Bajwa and Ravneet Singh Bittu. “Mr Sidhu spent 14 years in the BJP and now he is our party president. Mr Channi joined the party in 2012 and is now the CM. Manpreet Badal, who has been an Akali leader for most of his political life is our Finance Minister,” pointed out a leader who didn’t wish to be named. These developments have come alongside Capt. Amarinder's dismissal of media reports that he is engaged in back channel talks with the Congress high command. “I will soon launch my own party and will hold talks for seat sharing with @BJP4India, breakaway Akali factions and others for the Punjab elections in 2022, once farmers’ issue is resolved,” Mr. Singh had said on Saturday||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/punjab-cong-mps-weigh-their-options/article37277162.ece

Only the Congress was going to the people and fighting against the BJP Government in Uttar Pradesh, she said. ‘Missing in action’ Ms. Vadra’s comments at a rally in Gorakhpur came after SP chief Akhilesh Yadav had said that the BJP and the Congress were similar. “Who shut down the sugar mills set up here by the Congress? The SP and BSP Governments closed them and today they say the Congress is in collusion with the BJP,” Ms. Vadra said. “I want to ask them where are they? Why can’t we see them? Why don’t they come to you when there is struggle and during crisis? Only the Congress is coming, only the Congress is fighting,” Ms. Vadra said. She said the BJP Government had over the past seven years destroyed the efforts of the last 70 years. Ms. Vadra accused the BJP Government of oppressing various sections of society on a daily basis, including Dalits, OBCs, the poor and Brahmins. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was working against the teachings of Guru Gorakhnath, she said. Mr. Adityanath is the head priest of the Gorakhnath Temple. Plea to question Ms. Vadra also appealed to the people to start questioning the faith they had in their leader and look at the unfulfilled promises. “If you don’t become aware and don’t raise questions, then U.P. will not be able to come out of this abyss. Truth is that in the name of religion and faith, your sentiments and faith have been tampered with.

01 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Booster dose not must for all: doctors||Doctors in India advocating against COVID vaccination booster doses for all have said healthy individuals may not need them. The Union Health Ministry has also indicated that basic vaccination coverage for all is the current focus with optional COVID vaccination booster dose for vulnerable individuals. The indication comes at a time when the World Health Organization (WHO) with the support of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunisation and its COVID-19 Vaccines Working Group, continues to review the emerging evidence on the need for and timing of booster doses. A senior Health Ministry official, speaking on whether the Government plans to roll out booster doses for all, said: “Experts are definitely looking into research and suggestions from across the world and we are open to this evolving situation. Currently our main focus is to ensure that we extend our ongoing vaccination programme to all. Booster doses, in case a recommendation comes in, would be first offered to those who medically need it.” Doctors say that following COVID-19 infection, the immune system retains a memory of the virus. If a person gets exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus again, the immune cells recognise the viral pathogen and kill it. This is called immunological memory. This is the basis for durable protective immunity after a COVID-19 infection or vaccination. Durable memory Hari Kishan Gonuguntla, consultant interventional pulmonologist at Yashoda Hospitals in Hyderabad, said most studies have shown that durable memory can last more than 12 months. However, this may not protect everyone from re-infection. “Emergence of new strains pose a substantial risk of re-infection, which may go undetected in PCR tests. Hence vaccinating these populations, who had the previous infection, is a strategy to enhance immune response and can develop strong resistance against the new emerging strains which are of concern,” he added. Rajeev Jayadevan, vice-chairman, Research Cell, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Kerala, said vaccines remain highly effective at preventing severe disease. “Healthy individuals are able to generate a robust immune response after two exposures to the antigen; that is either by two doses of vaccine or by one bout of infection and one dose of vaccine,” said Dr. Jayadevan. According to him, the second dose is actually the booster dose, while the first dose is called a priming dose. “Whether adding a third dose will increase the existing protection from severe disease and death is not known in the case of healthy individuals,” he said. He added that in case of immunocompromised individuals, giving a third dose is agreed upon because two doses are not always enough to generate a sufficient immune response.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/booster-dose-not-must-for-all-doctors/article37276932.ece
01 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Ahead of COP26, Indian site highlights emissions gap||A day ahead of the commencement of the 26th United Nations Conference of Parties (COP) in Glasgow, Scotland, India has officially endorsed a website, made by Indian climate experts, that lists the historical carbon dioxide emissions of developed countries. The database aims to highlight the disparity between the emissions of developed and developing countries with countries such as the United States, Canada and Australia and those in Western Europe shown as having a net carbon debt while developing countries such as India and China having net credit. The key fact that the database highlights is that it is only fair that developed countries must commit to steeper targets towards curbing emissions than developing countries. India is the third largest emitter of carbon emissions annually but the sixth largest when historical emissions are considered, and when accounting for the size of its population it is among the lowest per capita emitters. This underlines India’s demands for climate justice being at the heart of negotiations and its reluctance to agree to a fixed time frame to reach net zero, or when — in balance — it will cease to emit greenhouse gases. “The website is intended to debunk the narrative provided by many developed countries, and global non-government organisations that focus attention continually on what developing countries must do, constantly demanding greater commitment and action from them,” says an accompanying press statement from the Environment Ministry. “Welcome the scientific initiative, Climate Equity Monitor, (https://climateequitymonitor.in) which went live today. Its focus on equity & climate action from a data and evidence-based perspective will encourage vigorous discussion on the crucial issue and engage experts from all nations,” Mr. Yadav tweeted from his official handle. The Climate Equity Monitor, as the site is called, is aimed at monitoring the performance of Annex-I Parties under the UNFCCC (developed countries) based on the “foundational principles” of the Climate Convention.

01 November 2021||New Delhi,||Afghan nationals receive a lifeline||Afghan nationals who came to India on an emergency visa after Taliban takeover of their country, may opt for “self-employment,” a senior government official said. The official said that other than a Government job or any other work in the government sector, Afghans living here could take up any other employment opportunity for sustenance. After the Taliban toppled the Government in Afghanistan in August and took over the reins, thousands of Afghans made desperate attempts to flee the country. India also evacuated its Embassy staff along with 112 Hindus and Sikhs from Afghanistan on special flight. As a humanitarian gesture, on August 17, India introduced “e-Emergency X-Miscellaneous visa” for the distressed residents. However, only a few such visas have been processed so far. A Home Ministry official declined to give the number of Afghans who had applied for the emergency visa or those who have come to India. A September 2 order by the Home Ministry said “Afghan nationals living in India on any category of visa will be granted extension of visa by FRRO/FRO [Foreigners Regional Registration Office] concerned on gratis basis until further orders. They will not be granted exit or issued leave India notice by FRRO/FRO concerned without the prior approval of the Ministry of Home Affairs.” Another official said that after the new category of visa was announced, around 60,000 applications were received. “The applications are vetted by the security agencies before they are processed,” said the official. In 2017, the Ministry had liberalised the “stay visa/residential permit” to Afghan nationals on a case-to-case basis on the grounds of “well-founded fear of persecution on account of rface, religion, sex, nationality, ethnic identity, membership of a particular social group or political opinion in Afghanistan.” The stay visa initially valid for one year is State-specific and is restricted to the State where they are permitted to stay. The eligible Afghans staying here on Long Term Visa, those from the six minority communities — Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Parsis, Jains and Buddhists, are allowed to open bank accounts or purchase small units to live or run a small business. The FRRO keeps a record of such employment opportunities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/afghan-nationals-receive-a-lifeline/article37276928.ece
01 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Informal sector shrank sharply in 2020-21’||Signalling a greater shift towards formalisation of the economy, the share of the large informal sector in overall economic activity dipped sharply in 2020-21 even as informal workers continue to bear the brunt of the pandemic’s adverse effects, the SBI said in a research report. Concluding that the share of the informal economy may have shrunk to no more than 20% of the economic output from about 52% in 2017-18, SBI group chief economic adviser Soumya Kanti Ghosh termed this “a positive development” amid the pandemic. There are wide variations in the formalisation levels in different sectors but the SBI estimated that the informal economy is possibly at a maximum of 15% to 20% of formal GDP in 2020-21. An IMF policy paper earlier this year estimated that the share of India’s informal economy in the Gross Value Added (GVA) was at 53.9% in 2011-12 and improved only marginally to 52.4% in 2017-18. As per a National Sample Survey (NSS) of 2014, around 93% of the workforce earned their livelihoods as informal workers. The informal sector consists of “own-account” or unorganised enterprises employing hired workers, with the highest share of such unorganised activity being in agriculture where holdings are small and fragmented. Agriculture takes a hit The SBI projections suggest that the informal agriculture sector has shrunk from 97.1% of the sector’s GVA in 2017-18 to just 70%-75% in 2020-21, driven by the increased penetration of credit through Kisan credit cards. Real estate has also seen a significant dip in informal activity from 52.8% in 2017-18 to 20%-25% last year. The report estimated that about Rs. 1.2 lakh crore of cash usage has been formalised since the COVID-19 pandemic. Formal agriculture credit flows have grown Rs. 4.6 lakh crore between 2017-18 and 2020-21, with digital payments for petrol and diesel rising around Rs. 1 lakh crore in the same period. Mooting a rethink of high fuel taxes, the SBI’s top economist said: “We believe that the Government should ensure that the existing tax structure is favourable to this tax paying population that constitutes 8.5% but cross subsidises 91.5% of the population. To that extent, the existing tax structure particularly of indirect taxes on fuel should not be consumption negative.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/informal-sector-shrank-sharply-in-2020-21/article37276930.ece
01 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Navy takes delivery of warship||The first ship of the four Project-15B state-of-the-art stealth guided missile destroyers, Visakhapatnam, being built at the Mazgaon Docks Limited (MDL), was delivered to the Navy last Friday. Delayed by three years, the ships will be commissioned very soon. “The 163-metre-long warship has a full load displacement of 7,400 tonnes and a maximum speed of 30 knots. The overall indigenous content of the project is approximately 75%,” the Navy said on Sunday. The contract for the construction of the ships was signed in January 2011 at a project cost of about Rs. 29,643.74 crore. In-house design The design of the ships has been developed in-house by the Directorate of Naval Design and are a follow-on of the Kolkata class (Project 15A) destroyers. The four ships are named after major cities from all four corners of the country — Visakhapatnam, Mormugao, Imphal and Surat, the Navy said. The keel of Visakhapatnam was laid in October 2013 and the ship was launched in April 2015. These ships are equipped with BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles and long-range Surface-to-Air missiles (SAM). The ship has several indigenous weapons systems like medium range SAMs, indigenous torpedo tube launchers, anti-submarine indigenous rocket launchers and 76-mm super rapid gun mount, the Navy said. “The induction of the destroyer, despite the COVID challenges, is a tribute to the collaborative efforts of a large number of stake-holders and would enhance the maritime prowess in the Indian Ocean Region.” Series production The design of Project 15B has largely maintained the hull form, propulsion machinery, many platform equipment and major weapons and sensors as the Kolkata class to benefit from series production. However, these ships feature enhanced stealth features over the earlier class through shaping of hull and use of radar transparent deck fittings which make them difficult to detect and also feature significant advances in automation and networking. These ships are propelled by four gas turbines in Combined Gas and Gas (COGAG) configuration and have maximum endurance of 4000 nm at economical speed of 14 knots, the Navy had said earlier.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/navy-takes-delivery-of-warship/article37276917.ece
01 November 2021||Ghaziabad,||Rashtriya Lok Dal releases election manifesto for U.P.||Raising the bar for the battle for Uttar Pradesh, the Rashtriya Lok Dal on Sunday promised one crore jobs for youth if voted to power. Releasing the election manifesto in Lucknow, party president Jayant Singh said the party had made 22 resolutions for 2022 after extensive consultation with stakeholders. Underlining that the RLD was the first political party to release a manifesto, he said the party had set the agenda for the Assembly polls by raising “real issues that concern the electorate.” He hoped that the State Government would respond to the party’s manifesto and try to better it in the months leading to the election. “Up till now, it seems that Yogiji (Chief Minister Adityanath) is contesting elections against the Pakistan cricket team and if that is not available he would stand against Aurangazeb,” Mr. Singh said. He added that wherever the BJP would ignite the “fire of communalism”, the RLD would work to douse the flames with “the spirit of bhaichara (brotherhood).” “The claim of one crore jobs sounds tall but it is only 3-4 % of the total population of the State,” said Mr Singh. He said that if a government could not provide jobs to even 3% of its population in five years, there was no point in associating with such a system. “The BJP government had promised 70 lakh jobs to youth in 2017 but according to party advertisements it has been able to provide only four lakh jobs in the last five years,” he said. Committed to improving the situation of farmers, the RLD manifesto, released on the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, promised to double the amount given to farmers under the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana. “The farmers would be given Rs. 6,000 over the Central Government scheme annually on December 23, the birth anniversary of Chaudhary Charan Singh. For farmers working on barren land, this amount will be Rs. 9,000,” Mr. Singh said, adding that the wage rate of the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme would be raised to Rs. 320, the highest in the country. Standing by farmers Putting the ongoing farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s agriculture reform laws in the category of historic movements such as those of Champaran, Malabar and Bardoli, Mr. Singh promised to pass a resolution against the laws in the first session of the new Assembly if voted to power. He added that farmers who had lost their lives during the agitation would be given the status of martyrs. The manifesto promised to set the State Advisory Price (SAP) for sugarcane and potato at 1.5 times the cost incurred and guaranteed payment within 14 days. It promised audits of mills that could not pay the sugarcane farmers on time and a new, more effective State crop insurance scheme for farmers. Tackling the issue of rising electricity bills in the State, the party promised to waive off the outstanding bills of farmers and weavers and cut down the charges by half. Making a brave move in a region known for its deep-seated patriarchy, the party assured 50% quota for women in jobs and promotions. Tapping on another long-standing issue, the party also promised that it would establish Benches of the Allahabad High Court in western Uttar Pradesh, Bundelkhand, and Purvanchal. The manifesto talked about the party’s commitment towards smaller administrative units but did not clarify on the demand for carving out a separate Harit Pradesh out of western Uttar Pradesh. It is also silent on reservation for Jats, another long-standing demand in the region, in Central Government jobs. “We have focussed on real issues that should provoke other parties to respond,” said Ajay Kumar, co-convenor of the manifesto committee. On bringing out a separate manifesto when talks on seat adjustment with Samajwadi Party were still in progress, Mr. Singh said the RLD was an independent entity, and a common minimum programme would be worked out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rashtriya-lok-dal-releases-election-manifesto-for-up/article37276924.ece
01 November 2021||CHENNAI,||Many railway schools likely to wind up||When the academic year begins next year, many railway schools across the country are likely to be closed. The Indian Railways has decided to go ahead with the closure of its schools and merge students with either Kendriya Vidyalayas or State Government schools as feasible. The General Managers of Zonal Railways have been told to identify schools with a relatively smaller number of railway wards that could be merged with and intimate the probable date of closure. Where it is absolutely essential to retain the schools, a detailed justification would have to be furnished to the Railway Board. In an official communication issued early this week, the Railway Board, while asking its General Managers to assess the situation and take a call, said that efforts should be made not to cause discomfort to the families of the children studying in the schools that would be closed/merged. It was also emphasised that no promotions in the Group-B/Senior Scale/Junior Administrative Grade be processed where rationalisation of schools were being done. No further indents should be placed to the Railway Recruitment Board as regards the schools planned for closure. The move to close down the decades-old railway schools follows the recommendations of Principal Economic Adviser Sanjeev Sanyal on the rationalisation of government bodies under the Ministry of Railways. The action on the recommendations got expedited after the Cabinet Secretariat, Rashtrapati Bhavan, called for a monthly update on the PEA’s report. In his report, Mr. Sanyal said the railways were running 94 schools providing education for children of not only railway employees but others too. However, as of 2019, only 15,399 railway wards were enrolled which was less than half of other non-railway students who constituted 34,277. The Railways also supported 87 Kendriya Vidyalayas where 33,212 railway wards and 55,386 other students were enrolled. Of the total eight lakh children of railway employees in the 4-18 age-group, less than 2% were enrolled in railway schools.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/many-railway-schools-likely-to-be-closed-next-year/article37276915.ece
01 November 2021||NUH,||Over 100 schools sans teachers in Delhi’s backyard||The Government Girls’ Middle School in Nuh’s Devla Nangli, with around 100 students, never had a teacher over the past decade, except for a few months in between when a science teacher was appointed. But she soon got transferred out. In view of the loss of learning for the children, the headmaster at the Primary School in the same campus has asked his staff members to teach the girls in their free time. The staff members, though qualified to teach only the primary classes, also teach the students at the Senior Secondary School, also in the same campus, but with only one Trained Graduate Teacher for Physical Education. As many as 111 schools, including Primary, Middle and Senior Secondary, in Nuh don’t have a single teacher. This Meo Muslim-dominated district of Haryana not just borders the State’s financial capital and IT hub Gurugram, but also falls in the National Capital Region. Only a 100 km away from Delhi, Nuh, ironically, figures among Niti Aayog’s 100-odd “Most Aspirational Districts”, a euphemism for the backward areas, and was at the bottom of the table in 2018. Now it ranks 31. Education is among the five thematic areas identified for the rankings. Another Girls’ Senior Secondary school in Khor Basai with a strength of 300 and catering to around half-a-dozen villages has a lone woman teacher, commuting from Gurugram. School principal Dinesh Sharma has requested the staff members from the neighbouring boys’ school to teach the girls. “There has been no deployment of staff on deputation officially,” says Mr. Sharma. His former student, Rahul Khan, and Raisika, a local girl, also volunteer. “It is not just the teaching staff, but the amenities like black board and drinking water are also missing. The doors to the toilets are broken. The contractor has left the construction work. There is no visit from the higher-ups,” says Mr. Sharma, recently promoted as principal, sounding helpless. As one drives down the NH-248A, the number of schools without teachers grows in Punhana and Ferozepur Jhirka blocks bordering Rajasthan and the student-to-teacher ratio worsens. Of the five blocks, these two blocks together account for around 80 schools without teachers. The 2017-batch Junior Basic Training teacher Surender, posted at Devla Nangli’s Primary School, says not just the teachers, but the staff in other departmentsis also reluctant to be posted at Nuh owing to poor connectivity and lack of basic amenities. Surender, a native of Mahendragarh district, daily spends six hours travelling to and from Nuh for lack of good accommodation facilities. “I tried staying at a rented accommodation in a village, but the water was not even fit for bathing. It is difficult to get a branded drinking water bottle. For vegetarians, it is even more difficult,” says Surender. Appointed under the Mewat cadre, specially created by the Congress government, Surender says he could not get transfer outside Nuh and felt like “married to this area”. Many of the teachers, even from far-off areas such as Sonipat and Rohtak, prefer to commute daily and have hired luxury buses to travel. Dhirpal says posting to Nuh was considered “punishment posting” with the area being crime-prone, but the situation has changed over the past few years. “People, especially the women, would fear posting to Nuh. But the outlook has changed a lot. A large population prefers to send their kids to madrasas, and also enrol them in schools just to take benefit of government schemes,” says Dhirpal, of Jhajjar’s Badli. The acute shortage of teaching staff is also been an important contributor to the high dropout rate. While the hiring for the Mewat cadre is disproportionate to the number of sanctioned posts, the teachers from the rest of Haryana, if transferred to Nuh, take legal course to get their transfer order revoked. “While many schools have surplus teachers, almost half of the sanctioned posts in Nuh are vacant for years. The government had also promised 10% allowance to the teachers, but it remains unfulfilled,” says Surender Kumar, JBT teacher, from Bhiwani. Mohammad Alisher, reengaged as a teacher after his retirement, suggests hiring more local youth. Govt. assurance Deputy Commissioner Capt. Shakti Singh tells The Hindu that teachers were temporarily deputed and in some cases were being shared among schools within the same campus. He added the matter was taken up with the government and they were assured that soon more teachers would be provided.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/over-100-schools-sans-teachers-in-delhis-backyard/article37276945.ece
01 November 2021||New Delhi,||HC seeks school’s reply on ‘forced charity’||The Delhi High Court has issued notice to a school in the capital, on the plea of a headmistress who alleged that she was being harassed by the school management for refusing to pay Rs. 70,000 as donation towards the Ram Mandir construction in Ayodhya. Justice Kameswar Rao issued notices to Rao Mehar Chand Saraswati Vidya Mandir School in Bhalaswa here and Samarth Shiksha Samiti, the society which runs the school, on the plea by headmistress Hema Bajaj. The High Court will hear the case again on December 17. In her petition, Ms. Bajaj claimed that the target to collect or contribute Rs. 70,000 to Rs. 1,00,000 for the purpose of construction of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya had been set by the school management in February this year. The petition, filed through advocate Khagesh B. Jha, stated that the staff had been asked to convince students or their parents to contribute or to visit market places to raise donations from shopkeepers or the general public. Ms. Bajaj said that she being not the class teacher of any class, and also because of the poor financial health of her family, had expressed her inability to contribute the amount of Rs. 70,000. This amount was over and above the yearly donation in the name of ‘Samarpan’ collected from staff, which too was raised from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 15,000, she said. Ms. Bajaj said despite financial constraints, she had donated Rs. 2,100 for the Ram Mandir collection on March 3, 2021 but refused to pay any amount for ‘Samarpan’ this year. The petition stated that Ms. Bajaj had sent a compliant to Delhi’s Education Minister regarding the harassment caused to her over the forced charity. The Office of the Deputy Chief Minister then directed the Department of Education to initiate an inquiry. Following this, Ms. Bajaj said the school management and the society had been vindictive towards her.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-seeks-schools-reply-on-forced-charity/article37276937.ece
01 November 2021||Pune,||Malik firm on stand against Wankhede||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and Maharashtra Minister Nawab Malik on Sunday said he stood firm on his claims that Narcotics Control Bureau Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede was a Muslim by birth and had produced a ‘bogus’ caste certificate to secure a government job. Speaking in Mumbai, Mr. Malik said he was not fighting a battle of caste or religion, but underscoring how a government job was obtained on a phoney caste certificate. “I stand by my statement that Sameer Wankhede is a Muslim and so is his family…he [Mr. Wankhede] secured his post by forging an SC certificate thereby taking away the rights of a poor SC candidate,” he said. “My fight is against fraud and certainly not any religion or caste,” he added. He further alleged that the Wankhede family had been hiding their identities since 2015. “The person whose name was ‘Dawood Wankhede’ [reference to Mr. Wankhede’s father] on his Facebook page started writing his name as ‘Dnyandev Wankhede’ when they realised that his son’s job was under threat. Likewise, Yasmeen Wankhede [Mr. Wankhede’s sister] became Jasmine Wankhede,” Mr. Malik said. Mr. Malik, who has been consistently targeting Mr. Wankhede after the latter had led the October 2 raid on the cruise ship in which drugs were allegedly recovered, has repeatedly been claiming that the entire NCB operation during which actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan and others were held was ‘fake’. Criticising vice-chairman of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) Arun Halder for claiming before the media that Mr. Wankhede had not committed any fraud, Mr. Malik said the NCSC member had failed to maintain the dignity of his post.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/malik-firm-on-stand-against-wankhede/article37276920.ece
01 November 2021||AHMEDABAD,||Say cheese: Shah says Amul model must go beyond dairy||Union Home and Cooperation Minister Amit Shah said on Sunday that the cooperative sector’s contribution in creating a $5-trillion economy will be immense as shown by the success of Amul, the world’s largest milk cooperative. At an event organised to mark the completion of 75 years of Amul, which was started in 1946 as a cooperative movement in Anand, Gujarat, Mr. Shah said the cooperative sector will also prove crucial in making the agriculture sector self-reliant. “We need to implement this cooperative model to uplift sectors like agriculture and animal husbandry. The cooperative model will prove crucial in making agriculture ‘atmanirbhar’ [self-reliant],” the Union Minister said at the function on the premises of Amul dairy. Mr. Shah, who has been given the portfolio of the newly created Ministry, said the time has come to take Amul model beyond milk and dairy sectors. “Today, many farmers have turned to organic farming but they do not have any platform to sell the produce in India and the world. Can cooperative organisations like Amul help them in doing it? Time has come to think on those lines,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/amul-model-can-go-beyond-milk-and-dairy-sector-shah/article37276936.ece

01 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||CBI arrests conduit in Anil Deshmukh case||The Central Bureau of Investigation on Sunday made the first arrest of an alleged middleman in connection with the corruption charges involving former Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh and others. The accused has been identified as Santosh Jagtap. The CBI has got his custody till November 4 from a Mumbai court. “Despite repeated summons, he did not join the investigation and had gone underground in August. Therefore, we got a non-bailable warrant from the competent court and arrested him,” said an agency official. It is alleged that Mr. Jagtap operated as a middleman for the transfer and posting of officials. The agency had registered the case in April, after a preliminary enquiry conducted on the directions of the Bombay HC. Mr. Deshmukh resigned from the Council of Ministers post following the court directive. During the enquiry, the CBI recorded the statements of several persons, including Mr. Deshmukh, former Mumbai Police chief Param Bir Singh and the now ousted Assistant Police Inspector Sachin Vaze. Based on the CBI case, the Enforcement Directorate initiated a money laundering probe and arrested Kundan Sambhaj Shinde, the then personal assistant of Mr. Deshmukh, and his then personal secretary, Sanjeev Suryakant Palande. The ED has summoned Mr. Deshmukh several times to record his statement. However, he has not yet appeared before the probe team. The agency claimed to have identified 11 companies directly controlled by Mr. Deshmukh’s family members and 13 others that are in the name of close associates.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cbi-arrests-conduit-in-anil-deshmukh-case/article37277348.ece
01 November 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Punjab does a deep dive for Indus dolphins||The census of one of the world’s most threatened cetaceans, the Indus river dolphin ( Platanista gangetica minor ) — a freshwater dolphin that is found in Beas river, is all set to commence in the winter as part of the Centre’s pan-India project. However, Punjab’s wildlife preservation wing has gone a step ahead to not only protect the dolphins but also their natural habitat. The Indus river dolphin is classified as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and, until recently, it was believed that these dolphins were endemic to Pakistan. But in 2007, a remnant but viable population of Indus dolphins was discovered in Punjab’s Harike wildlife sanctuary and in the lower Beas river. Since its discovery, research is being done by Punjab’s Department of Forests and Wildlife Preservation in partnership with WWF-India providing an understanding of current distribution, habitat use and population abundance. Indus river dolphin was declared the State aquatic animal of Punjab in 2019. “Enumeration of freshwater dolphins is being undertaken as a nationwide project of the Central Government. At the State level, the Punjab Government has taken the initiative for conservation of dolphins and its habitat,” Gitanjali Kanwar, Coordinator - Rivers, Wetlands and Water Policy, WWF-India, told The Hindu . The project is to be implemented over five years. “Alongside research, importance will be on engaging the riparian communities by encouraging community-led biological monitoring. Villages around the hot spot sites of dolphin occurrence will be developed as models for community-led conservation. Extension programmes will be held to develop a group of dedicated individuals, called ‘Beas-Dolphin Mitras’ [friends and protectors] of the river Beas. The project also will embark on dolphin eco tourism. We will adopt a participatory process to address various water conservation-related issues, including protection of freshwater habitats and species,” said Ms. Kanwar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/punjab-does-a-deep-dive-for-indus-dolphins/article37277148.ece
01 November 2021||HYDERABAD,||Poll panel sets in motion process to fill MLC seats||The process for filling the six vacancies in the Legislative Council under the MLAs quota has been set in motion by the Election Commission with November 29 as the date of poll. The term of six MLCs – Akula Lalitha, Mohammed Fareeduddin, Gutha Sukhender Reddy, Nethi Vidyasagar, Bodakunti Venkateshwarlu and Kadiyam Srihari – expired on June 3 this year. Though the vacancies were to be filled before the expiry of the term of the members, the Election Commission deferred the process in view of the COVID pandemic. The Commission in a release recalled that it had decided not to go ahead with the polls earlier as it would not be appropriate to hold the biennial election to the vacant seats till the pandemic situation significantly improved and conditions became conducive to hold the election. In this background, the Commission on Sunday issued schedule for the election of six seats including that of former Council chairman Mr. Sukhender Reddy. The notification for the election would be issued on November 9 and November 16 would be the last date for filing nominations. The nominations would be scrutinised the next day and the last date for their withdrawal was November 22. The MLAs would cast vote between 9 am and 4 pm on November 29 to elect the candidates nominated by political parties and the counting of votes would be held at 5 pm the same day. With more more than 100 MLAs in its fold, including those belonging to the MIM, the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is likely to retain all the six seats as the Opposition Congress and the BJP are unlikely to muster suitable numbers to field their nominees for the posts. The Election Commission has set December 1 as deadline for the completion of the election process. One more vacancy that arose out of completion of the term of Prof M. Srinivas Reddy in the Governor’s quota was pending clearance by the Governor after the Cabinet approved the candidature of Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) leader P.

Zydus Cadila’s ZyCov-D is the first vaccine cleared by India’s drug regulator for inoculation of those aged 12 years and above. To administer the needle-free vaccine, a disposable painless jet applicator costing Rs. 93 is required for each dose, which would take the price to Rs. 358 per dose. The Ahmedabad-based pharma company earlier had proposed a price of Rs. 1,900 for its three-dose regimen, sources said. “The company has brought down the price to Rs. 358 for each dose which includes Rs. 93, the cost of a disposable jet applicator, following repeated negotiations by the government.... A final decision in the matter is likely to be taken this week,” a source in the know of developments said. The three doses are to be administered 28 days apart.

And the commitment of all the countries to mobilise greater levels of capital for the less developed countries and the emerging economies,” he said, referring to the previous commitments made at the Paris agreement, which have not yet been fulfilled. Climate negotiators from the U.S., EU and U.K. had made a number of visits to Delhi over the past few months, pressing for India to update its commitments (NDCs) to include its target of 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030, and to set a date for ending the use of coal in power plants. However, Mr. Goyal said it would be necessary for developed countries to achieve much quicker emission cuts so that there is more “carbon space for the developing countries to pursue their development agenda”. “There are no adequate technologies to be able to absorb large amounts of clean energy into the grids and to maintain grid stability. And therefore, we will have to look at more technology before we can identify a year for Net Zero,” Mr. Goyal said. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said the failure of the G-20 summit to set a specific date for countries to achieve “Net Zero” carbon emissions had left his hopes “unfulfilled” but “not buried”, as the joint communique set the stage for tough negotiations at the COP26 Climate Change summit in Glasgow that begins on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/g20-ends-without-time-bound-promise/article37276909.ece
01 November 2021||November 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Punjab Congress MPs weigh their options||As the political situation continues to unravel in Punjab, Members of Parliament (MPs) may be trying to evaluate their response to former Chief Minister Captain (Retd.) Amarinder Singh’s assertion that he is determined to float his own party. With more than two and a half years left for the next Lok Sabha elections, the decision may be easy for some while others may have a more difficult choice to make. Capt. Amarinder's wife and Lok Sabha member from Patiala is one such MP and so are Mohammad Sadique and Manish Tewari, both close to the former Punjab Chief Minister. With Punjab’s Hindu population between 38% and 40%, the BJP would be keen to have on board a Hindu face like Mr. Tewari to reach out to an urban Hindu electorate, including forward castes such as Brahmins. Any decision, however, is incumbent on the Centre resolving the issue of the three contentious farm laws to the satisfaction of the farmers’ unions. Sources told The Hindu that Capt. Amarinder has reached out to some of his former colleagues. However, none is said to have committed to joining his party or the BJP. But independent of the Captain’s plans, leaders belonging to traditional Congress families are upset with the new order in Punjab, with Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi and Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief Navjot Singh Sidhu being considered “newcomers” who have pipped the old guard. And this includes leaders like Partap Singh Bajwa and Ravneet Singh Bittu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/punjab-congress-mps-weigh-their-options/article37276910.ece
01 November 2021||November 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Row over caste split of MGNREGA wage||Similar concerns have been raised by grassroots activists and union leaders in several States, including Jharkhand, West Bengal, Bihar, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, after a Central directive on March 2 this year to split MGNREGA budget for wage payments along caste lines. At a meeting with the Finance Secretary and Rural Development Ministry officials on October 11, the Social Justice Ministry and several State governments warned of “dissension”, “backlash” and threats to social harmony in villages following the directive. “A decision was then taken to go back to a single muster and payment system,” said one of the officials who attended the meeting. State government officials also said they had been informally assured that the directive would be revoked. However, no such order has been issued as yet, and a statement from the Rural Development Ministry on Saturday only said the system was being streamlined. “The category wise (SC, ST and Others) wage payment system, as made applicable from this current financial year, has been introduced to accurately reflect on the ground flow of funds to various population groups. Its further streamlining is being undertaken,” it said. SC payments favoured An analysis of 18 lakh fund transfer order transactions from 10 States between April and September by researchers from LibTech India showed that SC workers in most States were getting paid significantly faster than others. “Under the MGNREGA law, once the fund transfer order is approved, the Centre should take no longer than seven days to sign the payment order and credit the bank accounts of workers. The Centre transferred money to 46% of SC workers within the mandated seven days, while 80% got paid within 15 days after FTO approval. However, among non-SC/ST workers, only 26% were paid within seven days, and 51% were paid within 15 days,” explained Rajendran Narayanan, an assistant professor at Azim Premji University who led the LibTech research. “It goes against the universality of the MGNREGA scheme,” he added. In Jharkhand, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh, the gap was even more stark. In Madhya Pradesh, for instance, money was transferred within the mandated seven days for about half of SC and ST workers, but only 7% of workers from other communities. In Chhattisgarh, it was ST workers who got paid much faster than others. On the other hand, the Social Justice Ministry received complaints from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana that it was payments for SC workers which were being delayed, “creating dissensions in village communities”. A senior official in Tamil Nadu also said the Rural Development Department had received multiple complaints from SC representatives that their wages came later than others in June, the first time payment was made after the Central directive was implemented. The Karnataka government wrote to the Centre last month, noting that the SC account received funds six times during a period when funds were not received at all for the other two categories although wage demand was generated across categories, adding that field level officials were unable to provide any explanation to those left bereft. Cohesion at stake Abhay Kumar, a leader of the Grameen Coolie Karmikara Sangathane, a union of 2.5 lakh MGNREGA workers in Karnataka, has seen the devastating impact on the ground. “For years, we have seen that MGNREGA workers unions help to remove casteism, as women workers work together, and so start to socialise with each other across communities. But after this order, there is a backlash and divisions are coming back,” he said, noting that SC workers were getting paid earlier in about 80% cases. “Earlier, they used the word ‘we’, saying ‘we are fighting for our wages’. Now it has gone back to ‘ours versus theirs’. This kind of language signifies a very harmful and dangerous change in our communities,” he warned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tensions-rise-over-caste-split-of-mgnrega-wages/article37276911.ece
01 November 2021||ROME,||EU, U.S. end dispute over steel, aluminium tariff||The United States and the European Union on Sunday ended a dispute over steel and aluminium tariffs and said they would work on a global arrangement to combat “dirty” production and overcapacity in the industry. “The United States and the European Union have reached a major breakthrough that will address the existential threat of climate change while also protecting American jobs and American industry,” U.S. President Joe Biden said. Speaking at a joint news event with European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen on the sidelines of a G20 leaders’ meeting in Rome, Mr. Biden said the deal with the EU immediately removed tariffs on EU steel and aluminium that were imposed by the Donald Trump administration in 2018. In response, the EU removed tariffs on U.S. products like whiskey, power boats and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, imposed in retaliation for the steel and aluminium tariffs. Rather than just a simple return to the status quo from 2018, the United States and the European Union plan to also address the existential threat of climate change and production overcapacity in the steel industry, one of the biggest CO2 emitters in the world. “The global arrangement will add a powerful new tool in our quest for sustainability, achieving climate neutrality, and ensuring a level playing field for our steel and aluminium industries,” the European Commission head said. The global deal is to be worked out over the next two years to promote “green” steel and aluminium production and will be open to all countries that want to join, including China, whom the EU and the United States blame for excess global steel production capacity and “dirty” production technology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/eu-us-end-dispute-over-steel-aluminium-tariff/article37276912.ece
01 November 2021||November 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Jnana and karma||All actions are broadly classified as Preyas and Sreyas. Preyas refers to those actions that bring rewards in this life and for better life in future births. Sreyas leads to realising the atma swaroopa. Scriptures recommend Sreyas for the jiva and coax him to engage in atma vichara to know about the true nature of the atma and the Supreme Brahman. This is the highest knowledge and unlike worldly knowledge that is assimilated through the sense, mind and intellect, this jnana is gained with faith and sincerity. When Brahma Jnana is gained, the jiva is absolved of the effects of all karma, good and bad, and the soul gets liberated. In this context, Sri B. Sundarkumar drew attention to the view of the interpreters of Vedanta sastra who point out that jnana destroys only the effects of one’s bad karma. They say that the good karma such as those acts of the jiva that are directed to self realisation, are not destroyed though it is true that the effects of all karmas have to be nullified for attaining liberation. The important point in Gita teaching is to show that though all karma good or bad automatically bind the jiva to samsara, the subtle link between karma and jnana provides room for negotiation between them by the jiva. Krishna highlights the spirit in which the realised soul leads life. He does not renounce action but renounces the fruit of all action. There is no trace of ego, that is, the feeling of personal pride in doing any act; and there is no desire for any fruit that may result from the action done by him. All actions that are expected to be done and ordained for him are done to the best of his ability and they are dedicated to God wholeheartedly. If one imbibes this attitude, where is the question of being bound by karma?||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jnana-and-karma/article37276934.ece

01 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Stop tobacco sale to youth, says NCPCR||Tobacco use in all forms, whether smoking or chewing, is associated with severe COVID-19 casualties, according to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Indian Council of Medical Research. Now, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) has appealed to the Central Government to strengthen the tobacco control law to prevent the youth from taking up tobacco use. Experts have urged the Government to put curbs on the sale of tobacco products to those below 21, to impose a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising and to ban sale of single sticks of cigarettes/bidis. “It is scientifically established that if a person is kept away from tobacco till the age of 21 and above, there is a very high probability that he/she will remain tobacco-free for the rest of his life,” said Priyank Kanoongo, chairman, National Commission for Protection of Child Rights. “Increasing the minimum legal age for sale of tobacco products from 18 to 21 and banning the sale of loose/single stick of cigarettes by amending COTPA 2003 (Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act) are crucial to protect youth from tobacco as it has the potential to reduce tobacco use initiation and progression to regular smoking,” he said.

She was 64. Gupta, who was arrested in 2010, was charged under the Official Secrets Act and convicted by a lower court in May 2018 for supplying sensitive information to a Pakistani official. While sentencing her to three years in prison, additional sessions judge Sidharth Sharma granted her bail. Her appeal against the conviction was delayed in the Delhi High Court due to the COVID pandemic. Born in the Vikaspuri area of Delhi, Gupta had property at Bhiwadi in Ajmer where she was living alone at the time of her death. “Madhuri died in May and I did not know of it for days. Her brother Arun Gupta contacted me in June to inform that her death took place when the rest of the country was battling the second wave of COVID-19. However, she died of diabetes-related complications,” Mr. Dahiya said. The lawyer, who had known Gupta since they were students, maintains that Gupta had diabetes for a long time and had spoken of it in 2010 when she was arrested first in Delhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ex-diplomats-death-buries-spy-case/article37276908.ece

Mr. Gosavi, who made news after his selfie with Aryan Khan, son of Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan, went viral on social media after the drug bust of October 2, was arrested by the city police on October 28 in connection with a cheating case lodged against him in 2018. A local court later remanded him in police custody till November 5. The latest FIR was lodged at the Wanowrie police station late Saturday. Officials said the case was lodged following a complaint from a resident of Mohammadwadi, who alleged that he had been duped by Mr. Gosavi on the pretext of getting him a job in Malaysia in 2018-19. “The complainant has also alleged that Gosavi threatened him with a firearm when he sought his money — Rs. 1.5 lakh — back from the accused,” said a police official. Another FIR had been lodged in the city’s Lashkar police station on Saturday based on three other fraud plaints against Mr. Gosavi. On Thursday last week, a team of policemen from the anti-extortion cell of the Pune crime branch had taken the absconding Gosavi into custody from a lodge in the city’s Katraj area.

01 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||202 plots of OSR land in Chennai likely to be turned into parks||The Greater Chennai Corporation is planning to convert 202 plots of open space reservation (OSR) land into parks with the support of residents’ welfare associations under the ‘Namakku Naame Thittam’ to fast track the development of parks. Civic officials will approach the associations to detail the significant aspects of the initiative. Using the geographic information system, the Corporation has mapped 24 OSR plots in Tiruvottiyur, 81 in Manali, 102 in Madhavaram, 37 in Tondiarpet, 11 in Royapuram, 66 in Thiru. Vi. Ka. Nagar, 81 in Ambattur, 69 in Anna Nagar, 35 in Teynampet, 89 in Kodambakkam, 127 in Valasaravakkam, 48 in Alandur, 187 in Adyar, 61 in Perungudi and 111 in Sholinganallur. Of the 1,129 OSR land parcels, 611 are already parks while 118 are playgrounds and 129 are children’s parks. “We are putting up the details of OSR lands on the public site. We are also planning to include Google Maps information so people know the location of the land that will be set aside for public use. We are calling upon all residents’ welfare associations to come up with their proposals,” said Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi. “We held a special meeting two days ago so that we could prioritise developing parks on OSR plots. The interested residents’ welfare associations can come up with proposals in coordination with the Corporation engineers,” he said. “If residents’ welfare associations pay more than 50% of the cost, then they can take up the work themselves, and the government will cover the remaining amount. For example, if the cost of a park is Rs. 10 lakh, and if an association pays more than Rs. 5 lakh, then it can take up the work,” Mr. Bedi said. “In case the association gives at least 33% of the total cost of the project, then the remaining two-thirds will be given by the government, and then the conversion of the OSR land into a park will be taken up by means of a tendering process,” he added. V. Rajagopal, president, Anna Nagar Western Extension phase II Residents’ Welfare Association, said residents were planning to develop a children’s park on a small plot of OSR land in T.V.S. Avenue division 89. “Some residents suggested asking Corporation officials to explore the possibility of delegating powers to utilise property tax collected from houses in the locality to maintain such parks. Bigger projects require CSR funds,” he said. A few roadblocks Development of a few OSR plots have been delayed because of various local issues and litigation. T.S. Krishna Nagar Association president Babu said an OSR land in Mogappair, abutting 120 Feet Road, had not been developed though it was earmarked as park in the Tamil Nadu Housing Board layout. Now, residents have been requested to call 9444100198 to get support from officials under the ‘Namakku Naame Thittam’. Residents have also been asked to utilise the scheme for toilets, smart classrooms, waterbodies, street lights, hospitals, roads and other civic infrastructure projects that have not been taken up for the past few years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/202-plots-of-osr-land-likely-to-be-turned-into-parks/article37277290.ece
01 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||More barrages, check dams planned across the Palar||The Palar, which has been in full flow this year, may soon have two barrages and more check dams built in Kancheepuram and Chengalpattu districts. There are plans to divert surplus water to city lakes to cater to Chennai’s drinking water needs. The projects are awaiting the State government’s nod. This year, nearly 3.5 tmcft. was stored both as surface water and groundwater recharge in three recently constructed check dams alone across the Palar at Pazhayaseevaram, Esur Vallipuram and Vayalur. However, the river continued to have good flow as the regions upstream, including Kaveripakkam, received good rain during the southwest monsoon. About one tmcft of flood water was drained into the sea, said officials of the Water Resources Department. The department has submitted a proposal to build a Rs. 380-crore barrage across the river near Udayambakkam-Padalam for the benefit of residents and also convert the Vayalur check dam into a barrage. Once these two barrages with shutter arrangements are built, each of them would have a potential to store nearly 2.5 tmc both as surface and groundwater. Officials said there was a proposal to increase the height of Vayalur check dam up to five metre and convert it into a barrage. There is more scope for constructing such storage structures and recharging water table and it could be pumped for drinking water and irrigation needs. R. Muralimohan, secretary, Madurantakam Cooperative Sugar Mills Farmers Association, said the proposed barrage across the river near Udayambakkam-Padalam would benefit residents at least 25 villages. About 2,000 more acres may be registered for crushing at the nearby sugar mills once the project was implemented. Farmers want the major project to be started in a couple of months. Groundnuts, paddy, banana and sugarcane are mainly cultivated in the region, he said. The department is awaiting sanction for more check dams across areas such as Vengadapuram, Vengudi and a dyke-cum-check dam near Palur. A new check dam has been planned near Vishar at Kancheepuram district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/more-barrages-check-dams-planned-across-the-palar/article37277292.ece

01 November 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||‘Illam Thedi Kalvi is a pure Dravidian scheme fully funded by State Govt.’||When Chief Minister M.K. Stalin recently launched ‘Illam Thedi Kalvi’, a programme to compensate for the learning loss caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, even the ruling DMK’s political friends, like the Dravidar Kazhagam, expressed certain apprehensions. They feared the scheme was part of the agenda of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, and RSS cadre would penetrate the team of volunteers recruited to teach the students. Seeking to dispel their apprehensions, School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi says the scheme is fully funded by the State Government. “As the Chief Minister has declared, it is a pure Dravidian scheme,” he says. Edited excerpts:  What has led to the apprehension that the ‘Illam Thedi Kalvi’ scheme could be the brainchild of the BJP, and the DMK government should not fall prey to it? It could have stemmed from the government’s decision to involve volunteers in teaching students after school hours. As per the BJP’s NEP 2020, the volunteers could even interfere in the management of the school. We have conceived the project to bridge the learning loss caused by the pandemic in the last two years. Classes will be conducted at a common place after school hours, and this will continue for only six months. The government has allotted Rs. 200 crore for the programme. Dravidar Kazhagam leader K. Veeramani's apprehension will help us be doubly careful, and we will pay attention to the selection of volunteers. How are you going to implement it? We are launching the programme in 12 districts as a pilot project. This will give us an opportunity to closely study every aspect of the programme. The scheme will be extended to other districts from November 14. Prince Gajendrababu of the State Platform for Common School System has expressed the fear that the scheme could derail girls’ education. He said parents might stop sending girls to school if education was offered at the doorstep.... The programme is not a substitute for regular schooling and syllabus. The government is very particular about improving the learning skills of children. Around 1.10 lakh volunteers have expressed the desire to participate in the programme. Two days ago, the figure stood at 80,000, and 68,000 of them are women. There is awareness among women on educating girl children, and the volunteers will play a pivotal role in encouraging parents to send their children to school. Villupuram MP D. Ravikumar fears the programme could become a non-formal method of education, particularly when the dropout ratio of students between the ages of 7 and 10 is high in Tamil Nadu... On the contrary, the programme will help the government identify the students not attending schools. We have already re-admitted 1.28 lakh dropouts. During their interactions with students and parents, the volunteers will be in a position to identify those who had dropped out of schools. The government has two objectives — bring those who had left back to school and admit one lakh students to government schools every year. As schools reopen for lower classes on November 1, what does the government expect from teachers and parents? Students have gone through a tough time. There may have been a loss in the family, and this would have a bearing on their minds. That is why the Chief Minister wants teachers to turn the classroom into a happy place. MPs, MLAs and elected representatives of the local bodies will visit schools and welcome students with flowers. There will be singing, dancing and fun in the classrooms for the next two weeks.  K. Veeramani's apprehension will help us be doubly careful, and we will pay attention to the selection of volunteers||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/illam-thedi-kalvi-is-a-pure-dravidian-scheme-fully-funded-by-state-govt/article37277273.ece

The Greater Chennai Corporation has screened 1.17 lakh women for breast cancer in 2020-2021 at its urban primary health centres and community health centres. Women over 30 years were screened at Corporation facilities. Biopsy was taken for 296 women, and among them, 105 turned out to be benign while 22 were malignant. Zonal scheme Under the ‘Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam’ scheme, nurses will screen 10 women every day. Women health volunteers will visit households and identify women at risk of cancer. Royapuram and Thiru. Vi. Ka. Nagar zones successfully launched the ‘Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam’ scheme in October. The scheme will be launched in the remaining 13 zones in November, officials said. In addition to the initiative by the civic body, private hospitals have also launched free screening for breast cancer. VS Hospitals joined hands with Karkinos Healthcare to strengthen the fight against breast cancer.

01 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Stalin Rajangam, Sukirtharani to get Puthumaipithan memorial award||Dalit historian and writer Stalin Rajangam and feminist poet Sukirtharani have been chosen for the 25th Puthumaipithan Memorial Award by Vilakku Ilakkiya Amaippu, a U.S.-based forum, for 2020. A statement from the Vilakku literary group said writer Thilagavathy, Professor Su. Shanmugasundaram and poet Samayavel were part of the jury. Mr. Rajangam and Ms. Sukirtharani would receive Rs. 1,00,000 each and an award for their non-fiction and fictional work early next year. “I write Dalit history by adopting methodology followed by Iyotheethasar Pandithar. Usually, such historical writing is often slated as ‘fiction’. This award is recognition for his methodology,” said Mr. Rajangam. ‘Cultural residues’ “For Dalits, the historical evidence is either not written or it has been erased. This is why Dalit history cannot produce evidence as expected by mainstream historians. So, instead of searching for history directly, Dalits are forced to look for history as cultural and symbolic residues in the society. Tamil historical tradition was created by those who interpreted historical evidence. So, when Dalits do the same to cultural residues and symbols, it should not be denied to us. In the beginning, Dalits tried to create a history for themselves. At the same time, we are trying to make Dalit point of view, sacrifices and protests as a part of mainstream of history,” said Mr. Rajangam. Ms. Sukirtharani, whose works ‘Kaipatri En Kanavu Kel’, ‘Iravu Mirugam’, ‘Avalai Mozhipeyarthal’, ‘Kamathipoo’, ‘Ippadikku Evaal’ have been criticially acclaimed, said, “I am very happy. Every award comes with some kind of criticism but surprisingly I have not seen anything,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stalin-rajangam-poet-sukirtharani-to-get-award/article37277319.ece
01 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Second dose pendency increasing’||Tamil Nadu’s second dose pendency is increasing exponentially — at about 61 lakh now — as the administration of the first dose of COVID-19 vaccines has been on the rise since May, said Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan. Getting people inoculated will give immediate results, he said. In a letter to Collectors, the Health Secretary said in addition to the weekly mega camps, health teams in districts had been given detailed instructions on the need to focus on increasing daily vaccinations, along with local bodies, by following a saturation approach, identifying a line list of people yet to take the first dose and those eligible, due and overdue for the second. On the State and district-wise vaccination levels, he said more than the absolute number of jabs being administered per day or on the days when mega camps were held in each district, the real issue was the percentage in comparison with the eligible population yet to be given the first and second dose. Tamil Nadu’s percentage was still slightly below the national average due to a slow uptake in the first four-and-a-half months, he said. He called for district-level vaccination drives, aimed at addressing the issue of people delaying the second dose and avoiding the first. Collectors should start encouraging and appreciating habitations, village panchayats in rural areas and wards and zones in urban areas that achieve 100% first-dose coverage among those aged over 18. Workplaces should be encourged to display boards indicating that everyone is fully vaccinated, through encouragement, without being compelled, he said. A planned approach to saturate habitations and wards, in a graded and sustainable manner, through daily vaccinations, will be the way forward, he said. All districts can now start aiming at virus suppression by 100% contact tracing and addressing the source of infection, he said. On preventing a resurgence of COVID-19, he said even now, clusters were being reported after functions and events that had common dining. A new variant, already under investigation for reportedly being responsible for the recent rapid spread of infection in the U.K., had been identified in Indore, and found in 1% of the cases in Maharashtra, Dr. Radhakrishnan said. He stressed the need for strict adherence to standard operating procedures, wearing masks in public, crowded and closed spaces and maintaining physical distancing. Considering the northeast monsoon, he said dengue cases usually increased during the last three months of every year. Cases were showing an increasing trend, especially in Avadi, Chennai, Kancheepuram and Salem, he said, adding that focus should be on preventing mosquito breeding. He put forward the need to be alert about the continuing challenges in public health.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/second-dose-pendency-is-increasing/article37277268.ece

01 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Aavin clears dues of farmers||Ahead of the Deepavali festival, Aavin has settled milk dues of farmers, who are members of the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Milk Producers’ Federation. Around Rs. 340 crore has been disbursed using reserve funds and by availing top-up loan from a bank on the skimmed milk and butter stocks of the unions. Both these sources contributed equally for the settlement. M. G. Rajendran of the Tamil Nadu Milk Producers Association expressed happiness over this development. “Farmers had managed to tide over the pandemic due to income from the milk. A kind of permanent system should be put in place to ensure that the dues do not pile up,” he said. However, a section of dairy farmers said they were unhappy with the way the dues were settled. They had sought government intervention to settle the dues. “Before the pandemic, many unions were running at a profit. However, the government announced a reduction in milk prices by Rs. 3 a litre, which was a populist one. But it did not step in to support the federation financially,” said a farmer from Salem, who did not want to be named. To ensure timely payments to farmers, Aavin has planned to put in place a system, including opening of a separate account for the same. The federation had begun implementing austerity measures, including stoppage of free sweets to its staff. “We will be reducing fringe benefits of staff when the unions are running at a loss. These benefits were introduced when the milk major was making profits. They cannot claim such things as a right when overhead expenses are higher than income from sale of milk,” said K. S. Kandasamy, Managing Director, Aavin.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aavin-clears-farmers-dues/article37277293.ece
01 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Registration of forged sale deeds has not stopped: HC||The Madras High Court has said that fraudulent registration of sale deeds in the State have only reduced and not stopped completely despite several measures taken over the years by the Registration Department. Justice R. Suresh Kumar suggested the constitution of a tribunal, headed by a retired High Court judge and comprising two members — one from the Registration Department and another from the Revenue Department — to take a final call on the cancellation of registered documents. The judge said that the tribunal could be treated as a civil court and its decisions could be considered as a declaration over the title of property. The judge said that the Code of Civil Procedure could be made applicable to the tribunal. “It would be a viable and effective alternative redressal forum for a number of persons who have been hitherto driven from pillar to post for retrieval of their valuable immovable properties, which they acquired either by way of inheritance or out of their legally hard-earned fortune,” he said. The suggestion was made after taking note that the Legislative Assembly had passed a Bill on September 2 for amending the Registration Act of 1908 and empowering the Registrar to cancel documents registered in contravention of the Act’s provisions. The amendment states that orders passed by the Registrar on a plea to cancel a registered document could be appealed before the Inspector General of Registration (IGR) within 30 days. A further appeal would lie before the State government within 60 days of the order passed by the IGR. Wondering whether the decision taken by the IGR or the State government would amount to deciding the title over the property, the judge suggested constitution of tribunals in order to have an effective judicial or quasi-judicial mechanism. “The decision to be made by the tribunal may be treated as final for all practical purposes,” he said. The judge also noted that the Bill passed on September 2 also empowers the registering authority to refuse to register forged documents and prescribes three years of imprisonment for registering documents in contravention of the Act. Since the amendment was yet to come to force, till then the victims of fraudulent registration would have no choice but to approach civil courts and get embroilled in a long drawn process to get the deeds cancelled, the judge held. He pointed out that as per the law in force, no registered document could be cancelled by the registering authorities, and that power was vested exclusively with civil courts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/registration-of-forged-sale-deeds-has-not-stopped-hc/article37277287.ece
01 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Complaints raised over online payment of water and sewerage tax||City residents complained that the were not able to pay water, sewerage tax and charges online as details had not yet been updated. Satish Galley, a resident of Semmencheri, said Chennai Metrowater was yet to update tax for second half-yearly payment (between October and March) on the website. “I prefer paying tax online as it is hassle free and safe option during the pandemic. The water agency is collecting tax and charges in depots and area offices,” he said. Residents in Alandur zone and Anna Nagar too said they received text messages asking them to pay the dues and avoid surcharge. But, the portal had not been updated with dues to be remitted for second half year. V.Sandhya of Anna Nagar said the water agency must have its website updated with details to help consumers pay on time. Several senior citizens in areas like Kodambakkam said they found it easy to pay online. But, the option to pay for the entire year was not available. The water agency has earned a revenue of Rs. 152 crore in September through collection of tax and charges, which was highest amount collected in a month, particularly in the past five years. Nearly Rs. 110 crore had been collected in October, which was the second highest amount in a month. Officials of the Chennai Metrowater said it was still concentrating on collection of first half-yearly arrears ending in September. “We have not updated the details of the second half yearly payment as it would lead to disruption of online collection for one or two days. Information of dues to be paid for the current period will be updated this week,” said an official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/complaints-raised-over-online-payment-of-water-and-sewerage-tax/article37277284.ece
01 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Re-laying of roads pending following civic projects||Work on civic infrastructure in many areas has been delayed because of various line agencies’ failure to complete tasks ahead of the monsoon. Re-laying of roads in Macro Marvel Riverview County in Manapakkam (ward no. 157) has not been completed. Residents said the seven cross streets and the two main roads were dug up by Metrowater many months ago to lay house service connections for supply, and also for laying the drainage network. “The work is now complete but the road has not been re-laid yet. The city has already faced several spells of rain, and due to this, the condition of the streets in the colony has worsened,” a resident said. “After the rain, it is difficult to walk or drive because of the slush on the streets. This inconveniences 300 families in the colony, many of whom are elders. Several residents have been injured in falls. We will appreciate it if immediate steps are taken to lay temporary roads before heavy rains start. Cabs have refused to come to the gates of houses or even cancelled the trips. This makes it difficult for senior citizens who need doorstep pickup,” another resident said. Monsoon setting in Opposite the Police Commissioner’s Office on E.V.K. Sampath Salai, the road has been dug up and has not been re-laid despite the monsoon setting in. “You cannot even walk on the footpath. The work has been going on for over a month,” a resident said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/re-laying-of-roads-pending-following-civic-projects/article37277294.ece
01 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Leaders criticise govt. over T.N. Day||AIADMK coordinator O. Panneerselvam on Sunday came down heavily on Chief Minister M.K. Stalin for having announced that July 18 would be celebrated as Tamil Nadu Day. Mr. Panneerselvam recalled the decision taken by his party, while in power in 2019, to observe November 1 as Tamil Nadu Day as it was considered appropriate in view of the present State coming into being on that day in 1956, following the re-organisation of States in the country. Accusing the Chief Minister of seeking to change the AIADMK regime’s decision out of political grudge, he said Mr. Stalin had cited Tamil scholars as having urged him to make July 18 Tamil Nadu Day as it was on the day in 1967 that the Assembly adopted a resolution to rechristen Madras as Tamil Nadu. Later, Parliament adopted a law in 1968 and the State got its present name on January 14, 1969. “Even if one is to go by the argument of the Chief Minister, only January 14 should be marked as Tamil Nadu Day,” he said, terming the CM’s logic “inappropriate and unfair”. Moreover, the move is an attempt to distort history, as it will now mean that the State took birth 11 years later than when it actually did, he said. “This is against tradition,” he said. Tamil Nadu got its present limits on November 1, which was also being celebrated by other States that branched out from the then Madras State as their formation day, he said. Mr. Stalin should take back his announcement and continue with the practice of observing November 1 as Tamil Nadu Day, he said. AMMK general secretary T.T.V. Dhinakaran also urged Mr. Stalin to withdraw his announcement. “When there are many constructive works to be carried out, the DMK government should stop carrying out such inappropriate action,” Mr. Dhinakaran said.BJP State president K. Annamalai said that only November 1 should be observed as Tamil Nadu Day. VCK general secretary Sinthanai Selvan said: “Our leader Thol. Thirumavalavan welcomes the State government’s announcement. At the same time, we feel the controversy over the date should be resolved by building a consensus.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/leaders-criticise-govt-over-tamil-nadu-day/article37277314.ece

Volunteers of ‘Kovai Kulangal Padhukappu Amaippu’ organised the event after clearing waste materials that were strewn in and around the ghat. R. Manikandan, organiser of the event, said the floral tribute was arranged to remind people of the significance of the river and the ghat. “Perur Padithurai is where people immerse mortal remains of the departed and the ghat has been regarded as a holy place. The ashes of Mahatma Gandhi, K. Kamaraj and Jayaprakash Narayan were immersed in the river. The pots in which their ashes were brought are still kept at the ghat. However, of late, the ghat is littered with liquor bottles and miscreants use the place as a hangout at night. The floral tribute was organised to remind the public of the ghat’s holiness and the river’s significance in our lives,” he said. Praises to the river in Tamil were recited at the event.

01 November 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Malayali tribal community seeks inclusion in ST list||Members of the ST Malayali People Welfare Association have urged the State government to take steps to include their community in the Scheduled Tribes list. In a petition submitted to the Minister for Housing and Urban Development S. Muthusamy and District Collector H. Krishnanunni during their visit to Kadambur Hills on Sunday, the members said that over 30,000 people belonging to the tribal community were living in Kadambur and Bargur Hills for many generations without community certificates. While their counterparts in Shevaroyan Hills in Salem and Kolli Hills in Namakkal and few other districts were categorised under ST, they were yet to be included in the list. Based on the recommendations of the Tribal Research Centre in The Nilgiris, the State government had recommended the State government to include the tribal community in the Erode district in the ST list. But a Constitution (Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes) Orders (Amendment) Bill, 2016, introduced by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs in Lok Sabha that amends the Malayali community as Malayali Gounder community as ST. Since the Bill lapsed, the Centre again asked the State to submit a recommendation, and it was yet to be done, they said. They said that in the absence of ST certificate, they were denied reservation in educational institutions and government jobs. They urged the Minister and the Collector to take up the issue with the Chief Minister and expedite the process of recommending their inclusion in the ST list. Anthiyur MLA A.G. Venkatachalam was also present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/malayali-tribal-community-seeks-inclusion-in-st-list/article37277399.ece

01 November 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Bargain-hunting time of the year is here||Madurai’s festivals are synonymous with boisterous crowds, revelry and a carnival atmosphere. If it is religious zeal during Chithirai festival, it is shopping, rather bargain-hunting, that attracts people during the run-up to Deepavali which reaches a crescendo on the festival eve. The shopping hubs are Vilakkuthoon-South Masi Street area, Nethaji Road-West Masi Street area and commercial streets leading towards West and South towers of Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple. While all big shops sell white goods with attractive offers, it is the small shops and pavement ware the crowds are after. Just a folding cot, table or a cart and you have your shop ready. And there are stands with 50 or so hangers with dresses which can be moved around. Even shoulders become display stands for a few, and stationary bikes too. Just for Rs. 100 flat, you can buy a myriad of things - nightie, churidar, umbrella, laundry basket, folding mat... the kind of things on sale is mind-boggling, never mind the quality. The colours and designs are also as loud as the villagers who make up Madurai to a large extent and make it a lively place. Vendors crying out their bargains, horns blaring, police issuing warnings over public address system, it is a cacophony the shoppers just love, for which they have come all the way from various places in Madurai and neighbouring districts. Most of the vendors are locals but for a smattering few from north India who carry their ware through the crowd. Ismail, a vendor from Othakadai, who sells a popular fragrant spray, says they made a killing in the last three days of last Deepavali . He prays that rain should not play spoilsport in the following three days. The police have a big presence. One can see them and hear their voice everywhere with their announcements and advice: “ If you park here, the message about the fine will reach your phone before you reach home,” and “There are 1,000 cameras and 500 police men and women in plainclothes watching you on Masi streets.” Not all are happy But not all business people are happy. One of the leading tailors in the city said business is so-so. Their hey days are long over, as people buy off the shelves and impulse purchase and instant gratification is the name of the game now. Happy faces of mask-less bargain hunters and vendors, a slew of snacks and drinks on carts, the carnival atmosphere and general bonhomie. Deepavali is here once again.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bargain-hunting-time-of-the-year-is-here/article37277547.ece
01 November 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||TNSTC crew threaten to go on flash strike||The unruly behaviour of some group of youngsters near Goripalayam intersection resulted in the TNSTC bus crew members threatening to go on a flash strike on Saturday. Even as the large police personnel with senior officers present near Muthuramalinga Thevar statue, the unruly behaviour of the youngsters led to an uneasy calm since 2 p.m. During Thevar Jayanthi celebrations, a large number of youths neglected road rules and indulged in hitting passers-by in many parts of the city. Many passengers, who were initially taken aback, were later irked by the behaviour of the youth. While most of them were in an inebriated condition, they slammed the TNSTC buses which were passing through the Goripalayam junction towards Gokhale Road. When the youth blocked the buses, the drivers were stunned as they climbed up the roof of the bus and started squatting, shouting slogans in praise of Thevar. Even as the police personnel appealed to the youth to behave themselves and leave, they were adamant. In a bid to ensure that peace prevailed, a mild force was used following which they dispersed. Public demanded arrest and legal action against the violators who threatened the motorists and shopkeepers. In K. Pudur too, there were complaints of rash driving on two-wheelers by youth who had the flags of self-styled Thevar outfits. Commissioner of Police Prem Anand Sinha, who was monitoring the bandobust arrangements and security in and around Thevar statue following movement of political leaders, assured to initiate legal action against the violators. Traffic police in Madurai also complained of drunken driving in many parts of the city, though the district administration had instructed all the TASMAC outlets in the city limits to down shutters till October 30.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/unruly-youth-irk-tnstc-crew-in-madurai/article37277393.ece

01 November 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Festival rush adds to parking woes in Puducherry||With just a few days left for Deepavali, all commercial areas in the city have been overflowing with shoppers and parking of vehicles has become all the more cumbersome. Given the ever-increasing commercial development and influx of consumers from the city and neighbouring districts, lack of parking lots in the Boulevard, the nerve centre of the city, remains the foremost problem faced by thousands of shoppers visiting Puducherry every day. Although traffic police personnel are posted at strategic points, the narrow roads are unable to take the load of thousands of vehicles pouring into the Boulevard, resulting in traffic snarls on most roads. The problem is worse on Jawaharlal Nehru Street, M.G. Road, Anna Salai, Kamaraj Salai and Villupuram Road, where many textile and jewellery shops are located. Except a few, most showrooms and jewellery outlets have not provided space for vehicle parking. The parking space provided by the showrooms is also insufficient to cater to the needs of customers. A number of showrooms on J.N. Street and Kamaraj Salai have no space even for two-wheelers, forcing motorists to park vehicles at will on the available space on the roads. Shoppers have been facing a nightmarish experience as they are not able to find space in the designated parking lots. “At least 40% of the parking slots on J.N. Street are occupied by shopkeepers. We will request them to facilitate parking for shoppers,” said an official. P. Ajay, a resident of Kamaraj Nagar, said it was routine experience for them during the festive days as the road space remained the same while the number of vehicles had increased. “The city already does not have enough parking space. All shoppers have been parking their cars on the sides of the road, resulting in traffic snarls. It is high time the main shopping areas are declared vehicle-free zones,” he said. “As per the Puducherry Planning Authority (PPA) norms, commercial buildings have to provide 30 sq m of parking area for every 70 sq m of floor area. The PPA has been insisting that building owners provide off-street parking facilities,” an official said. According to Sunaina Mandeen of PondyCan, a civil society organisation, “Puducherry has now been witnessing a situation where we have as many or more vehicles than the population. It is physically impossible to fit all of them into the given space so some other plans must be made. Since many years, enough meetings and workshops to find a solution to this problem in an integrated and comprehensive manner have been conducted. But there has been no development beyond the meetings.” Initially, the authorities could start on traffic management plans in certain areas but ultimately it must be part of the city planning. Zoning is needed and convenience must be looked at. It is high time that organised parking in shopping areas is introduced, Ms. Mandeen said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/festival-rush-adds-to-parking-woes-in-puducherry/article37277634.ece

In response to a report, ‘Dip in water quality in urban areas’published in The Hindu on October 29, the convener of AGG, C.H. Balamohan, said the PWD’s move to have more borewells as a step towards providing potable drinking water would be disastrous for the Union Territory. The PWD planned to dig 84 borewells near river beds utilising Rs. 454 crore availed as loan from AFD. Mr. Balamohan said he had written to AFD country director Bruno Bosle, urging him to scrap the project. He cited a report of the Central Ground Water Board advising the Union Territory against drilling borewells. “As the groundwater development in the Puducherry region is rather very high, no further groundwater development is to be encouraged. On the other hand, there is an urgent need for regulation of over-exploitation, protection and augmentation of groundwater resources to recharge the depleted aquifer systems,” he quoted the technical report of the Board in the letter to AFD.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/collective-urges-french-development-agency-to-scrap-borewell-project/article37277636.ece

They should work in tandem with the Health Department to throw a safety net around students. Mechanisms should also be put in place to monitor the steps taken and amend them when needed. School reopening was an important step in overcoming the crises caused by the pandemic. Though digital classes had been conducted, students had not been able to meet or learn with their friends during COVID-19. Lack of direct education in schools had created challenges. Society, he urged, should come together to support the reopening. Taking into account concerns of the pandemic’s impact on students’ mental health, the government is prioritising fun and recreation in the first two weeks. Initial focus Knowing children up close and understanding them, interacting with them to gauge each child’s grasp of digital classes, addressing learning gaps, and engaging them in activities to ease the transition into the school environment is being underlined repeatedly. Counselling for students is also being recommended. Reopening is also seen as crucial in bringing back to school students in various parts of the State who had been forced away from digital classes owing to various reasons. Only after two weeks and a review of the COVID-19 situation will plans be drawn up for further academic activities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/after-19-months-kerala-to-open-schools-from-today/article37276958.ece
01 November 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Revenue officials, Corporation employees to jointly clear rainwater stagnation||Revenue officials have been deployed in the city to expedite draining of stagnant rainwater in residential areas and arterial roads housing major business establishments. The Thoothukudi Municipal Corporation, which has been facing rain-related problems since 2018, started creating a few structures to drain rainwater. These works, including a stormwater drainage channel being built to drain rainwater from Muthammal Colony and State Bank Colony, are yet to be completed. Similarly, no credible structure has been created in areas where rainwater stagnated in the past though the Corporation pumps out stagnant water on Great Cotton Road, VOC Road, VE Road, Thevarpuram Road, Bryant Nagar, Railway Station Road, Anna Nagar, Pon Subbiah Nagar, Muththammal Colony, State Bank Colony, Sundaravelpuram and a few more areas. When a storm water drain was constructed and blue metal spread to relay the road on the street opposite St. Thomas Matriculation Higher Secondary School recently, residents appealed to the work supervisor to extend the width of the road up to the drainage channel to avoid rainwater stagnation. However, the 15-foot-wide 150-metre-long road was laid with a gap between the road and the drainage channel. “Though photos and videos of the gap were sent to the Corporation Commissioner through media, no step was taken to correct it. Now, rainwater has collected in the space and we are waiting for revenue officials to visit the area to tell them the problem,” said a retired teacher from the street. When this correspondent sent the photos and the videos of the road and the storm water drainage to Corporation Commissioner T. Charusree, there was no response. Sources in the Revenue Department said Tahsildars had been deployed in Thoothukudi to expedite the ongoing works so as to restore normalcy during Deepavali. “As the Metrological Department has sounded a red alert, revenue officials have been roped in along with Corporation officials.” Collector K. Senthil Raj, who has sourced several pumps from other districts, confirmed that officials from various government departments, including Revenue, had been deployed to drain stagnant rainwater. Pumps to be installed  Meanwhile, Minister for Social Welfare P. Geetha Jeevan, along with Dr. Senthil Raj, visited the rain-hit areas on Sunday to expedite draining of stagnant rainwater. “Twenty-eight low-lying areas have been identified to install 180 pumps to drain stagnant water,” Ms. Geetha Jeevan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/revenue-officials-corporation-employees-to-jointly-clear-rainwater-stagnation/article37277701.ece

01 November 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Frequent spells of rain hit hard Deepavali business||Intermittent rain has hit textile business hard in Tiruchi. With just three days left for Deepavali, the last Sunday prior to the festival is considered the peak business period in a year. It is then that shoppers throng in large numbers to buy dress materials for their loved ones. Though scepticism prevails among textile traders on achieving their target this year due to the poor purchasing power among the people in the wake of unprecedented job loss due to COVID-19 pandemic, the traders have piled up stocks to cash in on the basic demand in the festival season. But continuous rain is playing spoilsport. The city has experienced moderate to heavy rainfall for the last few days. It was expected that the business would reach its peak on Sunday. But it registered at least three spells of rain from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Sunday alone, thereby forcing the people to cancel or postpone their shopping plan. The major business streets such as NSB Road, Singarathope, Big Bazaar, Nandi Koil Street, Super Bazaar and Teppakulam Post Officer road looked crowded and deserted on and off due to the intermittent spells. Shopping was affected as customers had to run for safety now and then. The phenomenon has affected all traders including retail and wholesale traders. The pavement vendors were the worst hit. While they lost golden business hours, the frequent rain made life difficult for them as the dress materials also had to be protected from getting drenched.. “Each and every minute in the last week prior to Deepavali is important for us. But the rain has diminished our hope. Many traders have piled up stock by availing loans at excessive interest rates. We do not know how to clear the stock,” says R. Akilan, a seasonal trader. With the meteorological department predicting more rain in the next few days, traders are keeping their fingers crossed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/frequent-spells-of-rain-hit-hard-deepavali-business/article37277383.ece
01 November 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Primary schools pull out all the stops to welcome back students||Government schools have apparently taken measures to welcome students with the traditional trappings of ‘aarathi’, a puja ritual heralding joy. Though not with a high degree of fanfare, some schools have installed colourful flags already in their possession, and hung mango leaves at the entrances of classrooms to make the students feel special on their first day of school this academic year after a hiatus of one and a half years. The schools have left no stone unturned to welcome the students amid fears of possible increase in dropout rates. There have been instances of parents taking their children along for their farm work to run errands. The teachers have their tasks cut out to convince parents about the long-term benefits of sending their children back to school, a headmaster said. There are indeed some issues that could be addressed only through a 'trial and error' mechanism, according to the teachers. For instance, seating limited number of children is a problem. There is no problem in schools where the enrolment is limited in proportion to the classrooms. But, in other schools where the student strength is more, teachers hope to address the problem by making them sit on mats. In any case, the Activity-Based Learning requires students to be seated on the floor, a senior teacher of an upper primary school said. Another problem that needs be addressed is preventing students from sitting in groups during the lunch break. The start of classes has implied that the noon meal centres will begin functioning, he said. There is an element of hope among teachers that the volunteers being recruited by the School Education Department under the 'Illam Thedi Kalvi' initiative will pave way for addressing the issue of possible increase in dropout rate. The presence of the volunteers will enable the teachers to reach out to the parents personally to send their wards to schools. The volunteers will, in particular, teach the basics to the students of level II who will be entering the portals of the schools for the first time after admission. It is a tall order to expect the children in primary level to keep track of the ‘Kalvi’ educational channel for keeping pace with their portions, headmasters acknowledge.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/primary-schools-pull-out-all-the-stops-to-welcome-back-students/article37277377.ece

Necessary safety protocols put in place in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic were being adhered to at the retiring rooms.

For more than a week, District Collectors have been inspecting schools in these districts, organising meetings with parents, teachers and others, checking basic infrastructure and civic amenities, especially in government schools. A SOP has been issued to all school authorities. On an average, 20 students will be allowed in each classroom depending on the flow of students. “Teachers were asked to take subjects related to motivation and well being. Play activities for students will help them socialise with each other and also with teachers," P. Kumaravel Pandian, Collector, Vellore, told The Hindu . At present, there are 4,446 schools for Classes I-VIII in these districts with Tiruvannamalai having the highest number of schools. More than six lakh students were enrolled in these classes in these districts with Tiruvannmalai having 1,30,620. Prior to the opening of schools, district education authorities gave a facelift for classrooms, playgrounds and toilets. Electrical lines in classrooms were changed with LED lights for blackboards. Benches for students in classrooms were earmarked with social distancing circles. “Hand sanitisers, thermal scanning and social distancing will be strictly maintained.

Following the outbreak of COVID-19, the Health Department initially posted 334 health inspectors through outsourcing April 2020. Subsequently, another 1,300 health inspectors were posted and involved in COVID-19 duty, like swab collection, sending infected patients to hospitals, bringing contacts of patients for RT-PCR testing and organising vaccination camps. “Four of our colleagues have died due to COVID-19 and road accidents. At least 200 of us were infected and then returned to duty. But we have been denied our salaries for months,” one of them said. At the Seyyar health unit district, salaries have not been disbursed since February. In other HUDs like Virudhunagar, payments since May are pending. Similarly, for health inspectors in Thanjavur, Tirunelveli, Nagercoil, Tiruvallur and Pudukottai, their salary of Rs. 20,000 has not been paid since June. After the DMK government assumed office, outsourced employees were made contract workers. “We have been representing our case with Health Department officials. But things have not changed,” a health inspector said. In Virudhunagar, salaries for May and June were diverted for procuring materials for COVID-19 duty, said Tamil Nadu Government Employees’ Association functionary C.E. Kannan. However, payments have been done up-to-date in the Sivakasi HUD. “Even in the Madurai HUD, payments were made on October 30,” a health inspector said. “Everyone has borrowed loans to run families. It is worse for those working in other districts as they need to pay rent and travel. We have taken up the issue with the Health Secretary and senior officials in the Health Department,” he said. Workers said they were expecting salary in the next two days in view of Deepavali. When contacted, Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said the National Health Mission would disburse the salary in a couple of days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/1600-health-inspectors-not-paid-salaries-for-months/article37277277.ece

The State Council for Educational Research and Training (SCERT) has prepared a bridge course, which will be taken up after the first two weeks for all classes. A host of safety rules, many of which were implemented when schools reopened for students of Classes IX to XII in September, will be enforced. They include mask wearing and physical distancing at all times. “We will be resuming classes in a phased manner, and have Classes VI to VIII first on campus,” said Priyanka Ghosh, principal, Vikas Mantra Public School. Ms. Ghosh said the school had an academic planner in place for November, largely focused on activities and interactive sessions for children. “Instead of jumping head first into their textbook lessons, we will have activities based on listening, speaking, reading and writing skills for English and other languages. Younger children in particular have not had much writing practice, and we will encourage them to write and complete the worksheets they were previously attempting online,” she said. “For teachers, the mantra is to be patient with the children, give them a lot of breaks, and listen to what they have to say about being back in school,” she added. Many schools are planning to welcome students with colourful classrooms, music, sweets and new notebooks. “For the parents of some students of Classes I and II, who would like to wait on campus during classes for the first few days, we have readied space. One of the main concerns that were put forth was whether young students will wear masks for several hours, and we have decided to give them breaks, when they will be taken to an outdoor space and allowed to take their masks off for a few minutes while maintaining physical distance,” said N. Vijayan, patron, Unified Self-Financing Schools’ Association, and Chairman, Zion group of schools. P.K. Ilamaran, president, Tamil Nadu Teachers’ Association, said schools should consistently follow up with students about their physical and mental health and ask students to inform them if any of their family members develop symptoms of COVID-19. “All teaching and non-teaching staff across most schools have been vaccinated, and we have experience implementing safety norms when senior students returned to campuses in September. Some schools with less space have chosen to accommodate students of only two to three classes per day on campus to avoid crowding,” he said.

Rosario Rajkumar Karumandapam   Residents of Murungappettai village under Mutharasanallur panchayat in Tiruchi have been inconvenienced by prolonged power cuts for the past six months. The complaints made to the authorities and elected party representatives have not been addressed in right earnest. The people expect the Electricity Department to rectify the situation. R. Thirugnanadesikan Murungapettai   The general public in Budalur have been requesting the Health Department authorities to restore ante-natal and post-partum treatment at the Government Taluk Hospital, since it is easily reachable from all directions. In view of COVID-19, the section extending ante-natal and postpartum care was shifted to the Upgraded Primary Health Centre at Kathadipatti, located far away. Women face trouble as the public transport service is inadequate. M. Sheik Abdullah Budalur   The deaths of five persons due to a fire mishap at a cracker shop at Sankarapuram in Kallakuruchi could have been prevented had the owners put in place proper safety measures. Crackers vendors have to extend fullest cooperation to the Police and Revenue departments and follow norms for storage to prevent such incidents. S.

01 November 2021||November 01 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Reader’s Mail - City||A culvert was built recently across the road near Tirunagar III stop, a busy intersection of three roads. A speed breaker was removed while building the culvert. Moreover, the road has not been properly relaid. I request the authorities to relay the speed breaker and repair the road. D. Ganesh, Tirunagar   It is a wise move to restrict free left turn at the new signal at the intersection of 120-Feet-Road and Melur Road in Mattuthavani. But when the signal turns green for vehicles from Surveyor Colony side, vehicles from Mattuthavani side need not be stopped. With a slight modification, the signal can turn green for those taking left turn into Surveyor Colony, so as to prevent pile-up of traffic on Melur Road. Regarding the report on congestion near Vishaal de Mal, after one-way traffic system was introduced on Alagarkoil Road, most of the mofussil buses take Anna bus stand route, leading to traffic congestion on Panagal Road. So, buses bound for Mattuthavani can be allowed to take a right turn at Tamukkam junction to go through Dr. Thangaraj Salai to reach district court roundabout till the elevated corridor work is over.

Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai and the Rajkumar family thanked each other and credited the fans of the actor for behaving responsibly and ensuring there was no violence. The Government moved the mortal remains of the departed actor from Sree Kanteerava Stadium, where they had been kept for public viewingsince Friday, before sunrise, two hours before the announced time of the procession, to prevent people from thronging the streets. The body was already at Sree Kanteerava Studio by sunrise. “We consciously took the call for security reasons,” said City Police Commissioner Kamal Pant. It effectively avoided crowds and provided some privacy to the late actor’s family members to conduct the last rites, unlike for Dr. Rajkumar in 2006. Puneeth’s elder brother Raghavendra Rajkumar said the family was relieved there was no violence during the past three days. “We are also citizens first and do not want to cause trouble or inconvenience to any member of the public. We still mourn the lives lost to violence when my father died. We are happy that such incidents did not recur with Appu (Puneeth),” he said. His brother Shiva Rajkumar thanked the State Government for the “excellent arrangements made” and thanked Puneeth’s fans for behaving responsibly. Mr. Bommai and Home Minister Araga Jnanendra appreciated the efforts of the city police and the civic body in managing the sensitive occasion with all grace and ensuring no untoward incident occurred. An estimate put the number of people who paid their last respects to Puneeth Rajkumar at over 10 lakh. “I appreciate the efforts of our police force, the BBMP, and the Revenue Department in maintaining peace. I also thank Dr. Rajkumar’s family for cooperating with us through the difficult time,” Mr. Bommai said. Mr. Jnanendra called constable Ganesh Nayak, who broke his leg on Friday night in a scuffle at the stadium when the mortal remains of the actor were first brought in — the lone incident during the three days — and assured him that all his medical expenses would be borne by the authorities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-rajkumar-family-relieved-as-funeral-goes-off-peacefully/article37277246.ece
01 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||NLSIU to launch 3-year LLB programme||The National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Bengaluru, plans to launch a three-year LLB programme from the next academic year. The announcement was made by Vice Chancellor of the university Sudhir Krishnaswamy during the 29th annual convocation that was held virtually on Sunday. In a press release, NLSIU said that it has secured the necessary regulatory approvals from the authorities as well as the governing bodies. “The inaugural batch will begin their education in July 2022. It will help re-energise and transform postgraduate legal education across India in the years ahead. We have assembled the best faculty team to redevelop India’s oldest law degree and we invite the brightest and the best graduates from any discipline to join us as we set out to radically transform legal education yet again,” Prof. Krishnaswamy said during his inaugural address. Currently, the university offers a five-year integrated B.A. LL.B (Hons.), one year LLM programme and several other distance education courses. This year, 865 students graduated from the various academic programmes offered by NLSIU. Saarthak Jain, who graduated from the B.A. LL.B.

In the convocation address, Gopalkrishna Gandhi, former Governor of West Bengal, who was the Chief Guest, spoke about respect for the law and the importance of fairness, balance, and cultivating trust.  I was very regular and stayed up to date with all my subjects, which helped me immensely. I also have an inclination towards law and enjoyed studying the subjects. Saarthak Jain, a student of B.A. LL.B. (Hons.) programme who received 8 gold medals   Consistency was the key to my success. I understood my strengths and weaknesses. This helped me develop my own learning mechanism. I got a lot of guidance from my teachers, while my peer group facilitated my learning. Daksh Kadian, a student of B.A. LL.B.

01 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Baggage system failure causes flight delays||Air passengers began venting their ire on social media as a baggage system failure at the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) caused a delay in flights on Sunday. Passengers started questioning Indigo Airlines on Twitter about the delays, some of them complaining about fears of missing their connecting flights or taxis. Others said they missed their flights altogether. One worried passenger tweeted: “Flight 6e 852 is stranded in Bangalore. Our scheduled departure was 12:40. Can someone please tell us what’s going on? I have a connecting taxi that I will miss. Please tell us what’s up.” One of the passengers who also sought an explanation on Twitter was author Amish Tripathi. “Very poor service by @IndiGO6E and @BLR Airport. Our team was travelling from Prayagraj for a shoot, and two of our bags have been lost. No proper answers, no solutions offered.” Another passenger blamed the carrier for the delays. “...Today many people missed their flight to various destination from Bangalore (Bengaluru) because of mismanagement from the Indigo staff. All of us were forced to take the bag tags on our own only from the kiosk of the airport as they didn’t accept printed bagtags (sic),” said the Twitter user. Indigo, in is response, said the delay was due to baggage belt failure at KIA. “Your flight is facing consequential delay due to baggage belt failure at Bengaluru airport. Our team is trying to get you in the air soon. Please hang in there as your flight is just waiting for the clearance to depart now.” Later, a press statement from Indigo said, “Owing to the check-in baggage belt failure at Kempegowda International Airport, our flights from Bengaluru are facing delays. We are proactively implementing measures to minimise the impact on other flights. We are also working with BIAL (Bangalore International Airport Ltd.) to resolve this issue. We regret the inconvenience caused to our passengers.” ‘For 15 minutes’ However, BIAL, in a statement, said, “On Sunday, the baggage system at Bengaluru airport failed for a short while but stabilised within a few minutes. The baggage system failure, which lasted for about 15 minutes, seems to have had a cascading effect with Indigo Airlines trying their best to cope. However, this has not impacted the flights or baggage of the other airlines operating at BLR Airport.” It added that that the airport “extended all support to Indigo Airlines.” A BIAL spokesperson added in a statement, “We are already working closely with our Baggage Handling System partner to check on all factors that could have caused this issue and will have it addressed. We regret the inconvenience that this has caused to passengers,” In view of the festival season, footfall at the airport has increased and waiting for security checks has increased.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/baggage-system-failure-causes-flight-delays/article37277202.ece
01 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Making Kannada learning a stress-free process for students||Around six years ago, Manjula Rambabu, a dentist by profession, relocated from the United States to Bengaluru. Her son had to start learning Kannada as a language in a CBSE school. As Dr. Rambabu’s mother tongue was Telugu, she too began learning Kannada with her son. “Although my son had to learn two new languages, Hindi and Kannada, he was able to pick up Kannada more easily,” she said. With the steady support and encouragement of his teachers, Dr. Rambabu and her son grew to love the language as they found lessons, stories, and themes relevant to their daily lives. In many ways, her experience with learning Kannada is different from that of many parents and children who say they are struggling with it. Bridging the gap The cultural power of a language can help bridge the gap between different communities. While most people believe that it is important to know the language of one’s environment, and that it’s best to initiate a child when young, execution remains a problem. Ways to integrate a language into the school curriculum is a long-debated issue, one that has no easy answers. Dr. Rambabu says that parents also need to get involved to help ensure that learning is a smooth and stress-free process. “My son had a lesson on Mysuru. Before the lesson was taught to him in class, we went to Mysuru and learned about its history and the culture,” she said. But it’s not easy to learn a new language, especially when parents know that they may be transferred to another State. A section of parents were up in arms with school managements when Kannada as a language was made mandatory. However, teachers point out that rather than forcing the issue, they have persuaded parents to understand how knowing conversational Kannada would help them in their day-to-day tasks. Many teachers put in extra effort by way of organising remedial lessons, assignments, and projects to make the learning curve smooth. Others have roped in parents who are also learning the language along with their children. Srinivas M.C., head of the Kannada Department, Delhi Public School, Bengaluru East, said at several open house events, teachers have persuaded many parents on how learning Kannada would help them. “We initially had a small set of parents who had migrated from other States who said that it would be difficult for their children to learn the language. We convinced them that we would help their children every step of the way. We also told them that their children would find it easy to communicate with more people and ensure that they are not alienated,” he said. Currently, the school teaches Kannada as the second language for students of classes one to five. While the Karnataka government brought out the Kannada Language Learning Act in 2015 that made it mandatory for schools to teach Kannada as the first or second language from class one onwards. However, T.S. Nagabharana, chairman, Kannada Development Authority (KDA), said it was, however, not implemented strictly. “Many schools are waking up to this rule now but there is a need to be firm and ensure that schools respect the law of the land,” he said. Ashwini Shetty, Kannada teacher for primary classes at Harvest International School, said they decided to engage with both children and parents. “Children are more open to learning new things or a language. So we used to teach children two new words a day and ask them to teach their parents how the word could be used in conversational Kannada. The moment they realised there was value for them, parents stopped complaining. Once we engaged with children and involved them in activities and cultural programmes, all these concerns faded,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/making-kannada-learning-a-stress-free-process-for-students/article37277209.ece
01 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Only 1.55 lakh properties in city have rainwater harvesting structures installed||Did Bengaluru miss the opportunity to harness rainwater in October when the city received ‘large excess’ of rain during the first half of the month? Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) officials admitted there are still thousands of properties that are yet to comply with the guidelines by installing rainwater harvesting (RWH) structures, either for storage or recharge of groundwater. As per the latest data, only 1.55 lakh properties in the city had RWH structures installed. Rainwater harvesting was recently made mandatory for sites measuring 30ft x 40ft in the city after the Karnataka Legislative Assembly adopted the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage (Amendment) Bill that seeks to harvest rainwater in the city. Prior to that, since August 2009, RWH had been mandatory only for sites measuring 60ft X 40ft and above. As per the 2009 guidelines, the water utility can levy 50% of the bill as penalty for the first six months and 100% subsequently. The BWSSB is currently collecting Rs. 1.5 crore a month as penalty. “While not being prohibitive, the objection of levying the penalty is to encourage more citizens to adopt RWH. The maximum spend on installing RWH systems will not exceed Rs. 20,000, which is a one-time expenditure,” a BWSSB official said. A recent report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) on the management of storm water in Bengaluru Urban area revealed that more than 40% of properties under the purview of the BWSSB had failed to adopt mandatory RWH structures. As per information provided to CAG by the BWSSB (in February 2020), about 2.12 lakh properties were required to adopt RWH structures, out of the total 9.85 lakh properties under its purview. However, at the time, only 1.27 lakh properties had adopted RWH structures. The compliance thereof was 60%. Dual piping systems The new amendment has also insisted on dual piping systems for properties on sites measuring more than 100ft X 100ft. The rainwater collected may be utilised for non-potable purposes. Citizens, however, have questioned the lack of any incentives for those who have adhered to the guidelines and installed RWH structures. Deepak M. (name changed), a resident of Malleswaram, pointed out that the Bengaluru Electricity Supply Company (Bescom) provides some subsidy to consumers who have installed solar rooftop water heaters. “The BWSSB should also incentivise those who comply with its guidelines,” he said. BWSSB officials admitted that the water utility had received several representations in this regard from citizens. A senior official said it was a policy decision that was yet being considered. V. Ramaprasad, urban expert, pointed out that the BWSSB also failed to check if the RWH structures installed were actually functional or ascertain if the consumption of supplied water had decreased or groundwater table increased. “The BWSSB should also take ownership of the groundwater and ensure there is equitable distribution by coming down on commercial exploitation and misutilisation of the resource,” he said. In response, BWSSB officials told The Hindu that the utility had stopped giving permission to public extraction and was permitting borewells on construction sites that would be used only for drinking purposes. “For construction, we are insisting on property owners/contractors to purchase treated water,” an official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/only-155-lakh-properties-in-city-have-rainwater-harvesting-structures-installed/article37277198.ece

01 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Register complaints at the click of a button now||The click of a button will help members of the public wishing to lodge their grievances about the services offered by the State Government as the facility will be launched by Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai on Monday. Over 600 services offered by the State Government through over 50 departments have been mapped out and brought under the Integrated Public Grievances Redressal System, under which people can lodge their complaints through a mobile app, a helpline (1902), or the web portal. Most of the services currently covered under Sakala are also on the integrated system. “The system was run on a pilot basis starting from January 2021, and following its success it is being launched by the Chief Minister on Monday,” said Rashmi G., project director of the Integrated Public Grievances Redressal System. She said even the types of possible grievances that can arise out of a service have been mapped out for the benefit of the user and the modes in which grievances were lodged previously. “It will help people articulate well. The public can also track the status of their complaint using the grievance ID/mobile number.” She said that in the new version of Janaspandana, a grievance lodged will directly reach the last-mile functionary for rectification or to offer solution. Various timelines have been fixed for different services, and if the grievance is not addressed within the timeline it gets automatically escalated to higher authorities, she added. The new system does not include emergency services such as fire, police or ambulance, and certain commercial activities such as Bescom, BWSSB, and MNREGA, among others. In case of inaction by the officer concerned, a system-generated show-cause notice will be served on them. To check the quality of grievance redressal, committees headed by the Chief Secretary (at the State level) and Deputy Commissioners (at the district level) will periodically review the system.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/register-complaints-at-the-click-of-a-button-now/article37277239.ece
01 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Kannada film industry left with a hole that will be difficult to fill||The death of Puneeth Rajkumar, considered one of the most bankable stars of Kannada cinema, is a big hit to an industry already floundering from the impact of the pandemic. “Over The Top platforms have accentuated the difficulty of drawing audiences to theatres for Kannada cinema. Among the present crop of heroes, Puneeth had an appeal across centres, age groups and regions. While there was immense craze about him among the youth, family audiences and even senior citizens came to theatres for his films. His death has left a big vacuum in this space,” said K.V. Chandrashekhar, president of Karnataka Film Exhibitors’ Association. In some ways, Puneeth filled the vacuum after the death of Vishnuvardhan, who had a similar cross-sectional appeal and an ability to bring family audiences to cinemas, a senior producer said. “I don’t see anyone who can fill this vacuum just now,” he said, adding that this also meant a further hit on the business prospects and the baseline of the industry. Puneeth was also on the cusp of challenging and reinventing himself as an actor, collaborating with independent film-maker Pawan Kumar of Lucia fame, he pointed out. Since 2019, as a producer, Puneeth had produced eight films — three under production, including a documentary on marine life off the Karnataka coast, and all new-wave indie films providing a platform for new talents such as Danish Sait and Hemanth Rao. Several other projects were in the discussion stage. A great hope His production house PRK Productions had emerged as a hope for many indie film-makers, as he was approachable. He also brought professionalism to both production and business aspects to the table, say industry insiders. With his death, the future of the production house is uncertain. “The production house had slowly emerged as the best platform to produce indie films since it not only meant funds, but also professionalism, assured business, and marketing, all of which are uphill tasks,” said film-maker Sandeep Kumar. Mr. Pawan Kumar said, “Puneeth had a larger vision to take Kannada cinema to the global stage with international standards. Sadly, that dream is now cut short.” Mr. Chandrashekhar said that the loss of promise he had shown was hard to digest. “Like the industry mourns Shankar Nag even today, speculating how he would have led it to newer heights if he had lived longer, it will lament Puneeth’s passing,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kannada-film-industry-left-with-a-hole-that-will-be-difficult-to-fill/article37277235.ece
01 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||They are reaping the benefits||Four years ago, when businessman Haryadi Srinivasa Rao Muralidhara, a businessman, installed a rainwater harvesting (RWH) system at his house in NGEF Layout, Nagarbhavi, the groundwater level was around 30 ft. Today, the water level has risen to less than 15 ft. “What I have installed is not a sophisticated system. Yet, it has helped recharge the groundwater,” he said. With the city largely dependent on water drawn from the Cauvery for drinking water purpose, harvesting rainwater to recharge the groundwater is most logical, say several urban experts. This is what inspired K.R. Chandrashekhar, author of ‘Namami Gange’, a book on water management, to install a RWH structure at his house in Basaveshwara Layout, Vijayanagar, way back in 2004. “We have two tanks — a 9,000-lt capacity one for rainwater and another one with 2,000-lt capacity for water supplied by the BWSSB. The overflow from the rainwater harvesting tank is let into another bottomless tank that recharges the groundwater,” he said. He pointed out that one good spell of rain was enough to fill up the RWH tank. “The overflow can also be let into the borewell to recharge groundwater,” he said. Million Wells campaign It was in 2015 that the ‘Million Wells for Bengaluru’ campaign was taken up in the city by the Biome Environmental Trust. The objective of the campaign was to not just improve the groundwater table in the city, but also provide livelihood to the traditional well diggers, also known as Mannu Vaddaru. Shubha Ramachandran, water team lead, Biome Environmental Trust, said as per their estimates, there were around 2 lakh RWH structures in the city, including percolation pits in drains and parks. There are several cases where the increase in groundwater has been documented. In Cubbon Park, there now is in place a sustainable system after the revival of seven old open wells and construction of as many as 74 recharge wells, she said. “The Horticulture Department used to buy water from the BWSSB. However, after the wells were revived, nearly 1 lakh litres are being drawn from them,” she said. The trust has also undertaken a project to map the open/recharge wells in the city.

In the last four months, the Shivamogga police seized four consignments, each weighing over 20 kg of ganja. In all the four incidents, it was the “Sheelavathi Ganja” sourced from Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh that was seized. The hilly terrain bordering Andhra Pradesh and Odisha is known for this variety of ganja cultivation. Locals grow ganja in large quantities and sell them at low prices. The people who carry it to different places make a huge profit by selling it at higher prices, say police. A senior police officer told The Hindu that a kilo of ganja is sold at Rs. 1,500 at the AOB area. The peddlers, who carry it to places like Shivamogga, Mangaluru, and parts of Kerala sell it at Rs. 15,000 per kilo. Given the profit margin, it has been a money-making trade.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ganja-from-aob-area-makes-its-way-to-malnad-town/article37277205.ece
01 November 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Fight to save century-old school on||The land where a century-old government higher primary school existed at Tumari in Sagar talukmay fall into the hands of a private individual, leaving locals agitated. A decision of the Revenue Department to issue a khata of the land in the name of the person led to this. The government school, which got its building in 1918, has been imparting education for generations. The villagers had formed a committee two years ago to celebrate its centenary. However, they could not do so due to COVID-19 restrictions and the khata was issued in the name of M.L. Subraya, a local resident. The school exists in Survey Number 24 of Tumari village. The total extent of land is 32 acres. In 1948, Savitramma got granted eight acres of land in the same survey number. However, none of the family had either cultivated or taken possession of the land so far. The Sagar tahsildar issued the khata of eight acres in the name of Subraya, grandson of Savitramma, in April 2020. The sketch in the khata covers the school and its playground. “Since our childhood, we have played in this land. Thousands of people have studied in the school. How can this land be given to private people?” asked Krishna Bhandari, a local resident. The villagers are finding fault with tahsildar Chandrashekhar Naik for issuing the khata, without verifying the structure. When The Hindu asked Shivamogga Deputy Commissioner K.B. Shivakumar about the issue, the officer said he would look into it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fight-to-save-century-old-school-on/article37277591.ece

While the turnout at the gyms and fitness centres on Saturday, a day after Puneeth died, was very poor, the owners and managers are hoping for the attendance to improve from Monday. The topic of discussion even among the few, who turned up for training on Saturday, centred around the actor’s untimely death and the impact of high-intensity and strenuous exercises on the heart. Describing Puneeth’s death as unfortunate, Sreejith, who runs a fitness centre in Bannimantap, said he was wary of unfounded rumours that could hurt the industry that took a big hit during the lockdown. A fan of the Kannada actor, Mr. Sreejith said people may start using the tragedy as an excuse to stay away from daily exercise. However, he pointed out that medical advice has remained in favour of daily exercise even after the actor’s demise. “Doctors have only cautioned people against crossing limits and overworking that strains the heart. Exercise in moderation does not harm anybody, but will only be beneficial,” said Mr. Sreejith, who has been training people for more than two decades now. Meanwhile, Harsha, president, Mysuru Gym Owners and Fitness Centres’ Association, ruled out the possibility of people discontinuing their exercise because of Puneeth’s death. He was hopeful of people returning to their gyms in the coming days. He said necessary steps would be taken by the association to ensure that gym-goers are strictly evaluated for any medical history and counselled before admission so that a suitable exercise schedule is followed. It will also ensure that gym trainers are qualified and possess a formal certificate from a reputed training institute. Mr. Harsha said that the association has started a month-long Fit Mysuru campaign, starting from November 1, offering a two-day free training to people at any of its 250-member gyms. It seeks to create an awareness about exercise and educate the public about fitness and following a healthy diet and lifestyle. “This campaign is also aimed at busting myths about gyms and fitness industry,” he said. He said the camp is open to everybody above the age of 6. Apart from lifting weights, people will also be exposed to Zumba, dance, yoga, aerobics etc., he said.  Doctors have only cautioned people against crossing limits and overworking that strains the heart. Exercise in moderation does not harm anybody, but will only be beneficial.

01 November 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Tobacco farmers oppose efforts to replace existing auction system with contract one||Farmers in the State have voiced their opposition to reported efforts to replace the existing system of auction of tobacco with a contract system for crop cultivation. Speaking at a recent programme on the occasion of World Tobacco Growers’ Day, organised by Federation of Virginia Flue Cured (VFC) Tobacco Growers’ Association of Karnataka at Periyapatna near here, vice-president of the federation Paramesh said the traders used to cheat the farmers with regard to payment and weights before the present system of auction was introduced by the Tobacco Board in 1984. After a lot of struggle and hardship during the pre-auction era, the system of auction was introduced, guaranteeing the farmers not only fair weights, but also transparent pricing and payment to their bank accounts within 10 days of selling their produce. Also, since the Board is facilitating production and marketing, banks are extending loans to the farmers the recovery of which is 100%, which is not possible in any other crop, said Mr. Paramesh, who is also the ex-president of the Committee of Fertilizers constituted by the Tobacco Board. “We don’t want any system other than the current e-auction system. In fact, the government should strengthen the present auction system by filling the vacancies for the posts of technical officers,” he said. President of the federation Javare Gowda said a number of multinational tobacco companies were batting for introduction of contract system on the lines of the system prevalent in countries such as Brazil. Since the crop is rain-fed, there is no guarantee on the quality or quantity of the crop. The contract system will make the farmers susceptible to exploitation by traders. Identifying tobacco as one of the most important commercial crops in Mysuru, Mr. Gowda said farmers have been growing the crop for more than 50 years under rain-fed conditions and earning their livelihood. Tobacco cultivation not only provides direct and indirect employment to more than three lakh people in Mysuru region, but also empowers the farmers economically and socially. While tobacco is cultivated even in the midst adverse weather conditions and labour issues, Mr. Gowda called upon the farmers to focus on quality and productivity to reap improved profits from tobacco cultivation. He advised the farmers to adopt sustainable farming practices recommended by the Tobacco Board and Central Tobacco Research Institute that included “timely planting with correct spacing, proper application of recommended fertilizers, use of need-based recommended pesticides, proper topping and desuckering, and harvesting of right leaves at the right time”. Though tobacco grown in Mysuru region does not have pesticide residue problem, farmers should take care while curing, bulking, grading and baling. “One should not use plastic fertilizer bag tarpaulin to cover the bulk and always use canvas tarpaulin provided by the Tobacco Board,” he said. A number of Tobacco Board officials, farmers’ leaders and tobacco growers participated in the World Tobacco Growers’ Day celebrations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/tobacco-farmers-oppose-efforts-to-replace-existing-auction-system-with-contract-one/article37277596.ece
01 November 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Emergency rooms witness huge rush||Actor Puneeth Rajkumar’s untimely death has led to a sudden spurt in number of people visiting hospitals for a cardiac check-up. The State-run Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research in Mysuru has witnessed a sharp increase in the number of people visiting the facility on KRS Road from different parts of Mysuru and nearby districts ever since Puneeth died on Friday. The hospital’s emergency saw many as 190 people coming in with complaints like chest pain and shoulder pain on Sunday. The ER receives a maximum of 70 persons a day. But, during the 24 hours preceding 3 p.m. on Sunday, a total of 190 people came in for an emergency check-up, said sources in the hospital. The number rushing to the hospital at night too increased. Between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m., the ER would normally receive around 20-25 persons. But, the number reached 98 between 8 p.m. on Saturday and 8 a.m. on Sunday, sources added. “We have had some doctors from K.R. Hospital and Ayurvedic Hospitals visit us for a check-up”, a source added while attributing most of the complaints to the psychological impact of the media coverage of the widely popular actor’s unexpected demise. A boy, 13, from Pandavapura in Mandya district, who complained of chest pain, was also rushed to the hospital by his father on Sunday. However, in most of the cases, the ECG and other cardiac tests yielded normal results. The doctors sent visitors away with medicine for acidity and normal pain. However, no such rush was seen in the Outpatient Department (OPD), which receives around 800 patients every day. “But, the emergency is so flooded with people that the emergency itself was looking like the OPD,” a source at the hospital remarked. The number of people inquiring at diagnostic centres and hospitals for cardiac-related checks too had increased since Puneeth’s demise. Many diagnostic centres and hospitals offered a number of options including packages covering a range of cardiac tests.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/emergency-rooms-witness-huge-rush/article37277587.ece

The conference was inaugurated by CPI(M) State committee member Vasanthachari who said that the need for Opposition unity with the Left and the progressives is required as the RSS which, he said, had colluded with the British, had come to power. He said unemployment in the country was on the rise and prices of essential commodities had skyrocketed and accused the RSS of fomenting trouble by attacking the CPI(M) and its party offices in West Bengal and elsewhere in the country. The country’s secular credentials and edifice were being dismantled by the BJP to promote its Hindutva agenda, said Mr. Vasanthachari. He called for a people’s movement to defeat the RSS agenda, adding that the CPI(M) was working towards this end. Earlier, the party workers took out a rally in the city to draw attention to the conference and issues related to price rise and unemployment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/members-of-cpim-stress-on-opposition-unity/article37277599.ece

01 November 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||CM to offer ‘bagina’ at KRS, Kabini tomorrow||Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai will offer ‘bagina’ (traditional thanksgiving) at the Kabini reservoir and the Krishnaraja Sagar (KRS) on Tuesday consequent to the dams attaining their maximum level. Mr. Bommai will offer ‘bagina’ sat the Kabini reservoir in H.D. Kote taluk at 11 a.m. and visit KRS in Srirangapatana taluk of Mandya district at 12.45 p.m. Live storage The water level at the Kabini dam was 2,284 feet and at the KRS was 124.8 feet as of Sunday. The gross storage capacity and the live storage at the Kabini was 19.52 thousand million cubic ft (tmcft) and it was 49.45 tmcft at the KRS. It is customary for the CMs of the State to offer ‘bagina’ on the dams reaching their full level. The practice was started when R. Gundu Rao was Chief Minister between 1980 and 1983. While the thanksgiving is normally offered in August or September, the KRS did not attain the FRL till as late as October 29 this year and hence the delay. October rains The Kabini on the other hand attained the FRL during the peak monsoon sometime in August but water level began receding soon after. However, rains during October ensured that the Kabini reservoir attained the FRL for the second time and it also coincided with the KRS attaining the FRL. KRS tends to attain the FRL during July or August but there was a deficit of nearly 25% in the rains in Kodagu which is a major Cauvery catchment area. As a result, the dam reached a maximum level of 120 feet against the FRL of 124.8 feet and began receding. It was down to 112 feet by the last week of September and Cauvery Neeravari Nigam Ltd. had given up hopes of the water level reaching the maximum mark this year. But heavy rains during October helped the dam attain its FRL.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/chief-minister-to-offer-bagina-at-krs-kabini-tomorrow/article37277204.ece

01 November 2021||November 01 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||cop||The run-up to the recent byelections to two Assembly seats saw politicians mounting personal attacks on an unprecedented scale. It was feared that it would continue and hit a crescendo on voting day. But that did not happen, though owing to a tragic turn of events. Because of the gloom that enveloped the State following the untimely death of film star Puneeth Rajkumar, polling in the two constituencies was hardly even taken note of. The media, which used to dedicate its prime space for these political attacks, barely reported them as all the attention was on Puneeth’s death. However, there is no guarantee that low-level political discourse will not come back with the 2023 Assembly elections approaching. But this recent episode has demon- strated that politicians will be forced to simmer down if the media and the public ignore their antics.   Since the BJP came to power in July 2019, it has faced a series of byelections, necessitated by the resignation of MLAs from the Congress and the JD(S), besides the demise of sitting legislators. Ahead of all these polls, BJP workers from Hassan actively participated, but the recent byelections held in Sindgi and Hangal were an exception. BJP legislator from Hassan Preetham Gowda (in picture) took a few hundred workers from the constituency to campaign in Kundagol, K.R. Pet, Sira, and Maski. The presence of workers from Hassan did leave a mark on the campaigns with their aggressive strategies and last-minute tactics to woo voters. Their role was recognised in the party’s victory both in K.R. Pet and Sira. Apart from Mr. Gowda, they were working directly under BJP State vice-president B.Y. Vijayendra, son of former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. However, this time, no one from Hassan took part in the election campaign. Neither Mr. Vijayendra nor Mr. Gowda were actively involved, according to a party worker. Interestingly, Mr. Gowda had openly expressed his disappointment over Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai meeting with JD(S) national president H.D. Deve Gowda soon after taking oath as Chief Minister.   An assertion made by Rehman Khan, former Rajya Sabha member and senior Congress member, that Muslims need not consider themselves a “minority” created a heated debate. Mr. Khan, who has led minority educational institutions and financial organisations meant for minority welfare for decades, got schooled online for his understanding of the terms “majority” and “minority”. At a meeting of leaders and workers of the Congress minority morcha, he said that Muslims should never think of themselves as minorities as they formed 22 crore of the 125-crore population of the country. This was flashed on the front pages of Urdu newspapers and discussions began on online portals about this line of thinking. Some felt that Mr. Khan had asked Muslims to be proud of the fact they were 22-crore strong. Some others, however, felt Mr. Khan had wrongly understood the concept of minority and thought it was an insult to be termed one. B.M. Farooque, JD(S) leader, responded to this claim at a bypoll rally and said, “Mr. Khan does not understand the problems of the common Muslim. It is a hard fact that Muslims are minorities and they are discriminated against. A leader like Mr. Khan who has enjoyed many privileges as he belongs to a minority community should not make such irresponsible statements.” B.S. Satish Kumar G.T.

He was speaking after laying the foundation stone for a higher secondary block to be constructed at a cost of Rs. 10 crore at AKG Memorial Government Higher Secondary School in Kannur on Sunday. He said those accompanying children to schools should get themselves vaccinated, and ward-level vigilance committees should monitor it. Besides, vigilance committees should urge people to get vaccinated. It is important for children to wear masks. Mr. Vijayan said the education sector in the State was now on the path of growth. The last five years have seen unparalleled progress in the field of public education thanks to the Public Education Protection Act. “The number of children attending schools is going up. Steps are being taken to make higher education institutions centres of excellence,” he said, adding that it was the Government’s aim to establish world-class schools.

01 November 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Look out for snakes on campuses, schools told||As schools reopen, wildlife officials have alerted the authorities to take steps to secure students from snakes. It is after a hiatus of almost one-and-a-half years that schools are reopening. Small mammals and snakes could have established themselves on unattended campuses and classrooms by the time. Floods caused by the recent heavy rains might have also forced snakes to take shelter in unattended classrooms and buildings. The possibility of encountering snakes on campuses remains high, said Y. Muhammad Anwar, State nodal officer for snake rescue and training of snake handlers. Incidentally, Shehala Sherin, a 10-year-old student of Sarvajana High School, Sulthan Bathery, had died two years ago after getting reportedly bitten by a snake in her classroom. Snakes could make themselves comfortable in holes and gaps on walls and floors of classrooms, which had been left unattended for long. Classrooms and other buildings on the campus shall be checked for burrows and holes. The gap between doors and door frames shall be sealed to prevent the entry of animals. Nocturnal snakes like Common Krait could sneak into rooms and buildings through such gaps. The undergrowth on campuses shall be cleared. Creepers that have grown over roofs and windows of buildings shall be cleared well in advance, he suggested. Incidentally, snake handlers in Kannur had picked up two snakes from a school campus after being alerted by the authorities, he said. The presence of mongoose in and around campuses shall be considered as an indication of the presence of snakes in the vicinity. There shall be a system for handling food waste, which, if left unattended will invite rodents and snakes that feed on them, he said. Officials shall keep a list of volunteers who have been trained in snake rescue operations. Details of volunteers in each district are available in SARPA, the mobile app developed by the Forest Department, he said.  Contact numbers of rescue coordinators: Thiruvananthapuram - M.

01 November 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Plan to set up cameras to spot waste dumping||The Kochi Corporation will soon decide on locations where surveillance cameras will be installed to spot illegal dumping of waste. The project will be implemented on Build-Operate-Transfer (BOP) mode, where the contracting company will install cameras at its own expense. It will be permitted to display advertisements on the posts on which cameras will be mounted. The civic body hopes to implement the project without spending money from its pocket, said T.K. Ashraf, chairman, health standing committee, Kochi Corporation. The plan is to set up at least 140 cameras initially. The proposal will be finalised at a meeting of the health standing committee and later at the corporation council meeting. The cameras of the civic body will be in addition to surveillance cameras of the city police. Waste management Mayor M. Anilkumar had earlier announced a scheme to streamline waste management and put an end to the practice of dumping garbage in canals. Illegal dumping of waste in canals has been causing environmental hazards, besides blocking free flow of floodwaters, the civic authorities said. There are a few locations in the city where residents have refused to pay fee for waste collection. As a result, waste generated in those areas are dumped on the road, thus thwarting efforts by the corporation to keep the city clean, Mr. Ashraf said. Surveillance will be stepped up on city borders, as people from neighbouring local bodies bring garbage to the city. Such tendencies need to be discouraged. At present, the Kochi Corporation processes waste generated in the neighbouring local bodies of Thrikkakara, Kalamassery, Cheranalloore, Thripunithura, Maradu, Kumbalanghi, and Eloor, he added. Meanwhile, the civic body had informed the Kerala High Court of its decision to install cameras, the other day. It also communicated to the court that corporation squads were keeping a watch on city streets during night hours to spot violators.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/plan-to-set-up-cameras-to-spot-waste-dumping/article37277495.ece

Personnel from the Enforcement Wing of the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) have been temporarily deputed to RTOs and sub-RTOs to clear pendency, said a senior official of the Transport Department. “The disruption of driving tests due to the pandemic had affected many applicants, mainly those who were waiting to go abroad. This functioning of driving schools was also affected. The permission to double the number of applicants appearing for the test was taken in such a situation,” he added. “The new measure has in turn resulted in 240 applicants being able to attend test held by the Ernakulam RTO each day, as compared to the usual 120,” said P.M. Shabeer, Ernakulam RTO. “The deployment of more personnel for licence test will help clear the backlog of over 4,000 applications,” said Salim Vijayakumar, Joint RTO, Aluva Sub Regional Transport Office. “We hope to clear the pending applications by December, since our office has been permitted to entertain 120 applicants each day in two batches, which is double the norm,” he added.

Many services suspended during the lockdown had not been restored and the matter was brought to the attention of the DCC by people's representatives. G.S. Jayalal, MLA, has directed Kerala Water Authority (KWA) officials to extend pipelines to all parts of the Chathannur constituency as part of the Rs. 100-crore drinking water project Dahaneer Chathannur. While the construction works of Kummalloor, Pallikkamannadi and Nagaroor bridges were evaluated at the meeting, the Minor Irrigation Department was asked to take required steps to drain the water of Polachira polder and make it cultivable. P.S. Supal, MLA, demanded immediate intervention of Revenue officials in removing soil from parts of eastern Kollam that reported landslips during the rain. He also said that various departments, including Revenue, Minor Irrigation, Police and Forest, should work in tandem to provide compensation for losses and ensure the safety of houses.

01 November 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||All eyes on Rajya Sabha berth in State||With the stage set for election to the Rajya Sabha seat that fell vacant with the resignation of Jose K. Mani, all eyes are now on whether the regional party will be able to keep the berth for itself. Revamped The KC(M), which has remained highly aspirational in its association with the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and even revamped itself on a semi-cadre line, has already set its eyes keen on the seat. “The vacancy is for a Rajya Sabha seat represented by the KC(M). A decision on the candidature will be announced at the right time after due consultations within the party,” Mr. Mani told mediapersons here on Sunday. While the LDF, in general, too appears favourably disposed towards giving the seat back to the KC(M), discussions are now on within the KC(M) as to who should be nominated as the candidate. While Mr. Mani prefers to keep the cards close to his chest, the selection is most likely to be between himself or KC(M) general secretary Stephen George. Strange situation According to party sources, Mr. Mani, who lost the Assembly election in Pala, has been in a strange situation of leading the party without any parliamentary position, though the political front he belongs to, remains in power. Considering that it is a situation that none of the Kerala Congress leaders had to confront in its more than five decades long history, the task came as a real test of character for Mr. Mani as he has to control the party legislators, especially those holding the ministerial berth. “But even though the captain has lost the game, Mr. Mani has been successful in reinvigorating the party and ensuring it a prominent position within the LDF. Having resigned from the Upper House to focus on the party as well as in State politics, it remains to be seen if he will walk back and go to the Rajya Sabha once again,” said a senior KC(M) leader. Mr. Mani had announced his resignation from the Rajya Sabha as early as in October last year while declaring the party's decision to join the LDF. Legal battle He, however, delayed the move till January in view of a legal battle with the Kerala Congress faction led by P.J. Joseph over the party symbol `two leaves'. Following this, he contested to the Assembly from Pala but was defeated. Mr. George, who contested from Kaduthuruthy, too lost to Mons Joseph.  The choice for the Rajya Sabha seat is most likely to be between Jose K. Mani or the KC(M) general secretary Stephen George.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/all-eyes-on-rajya-sabha-berth-in-state/article37277501.ece

The city corporation has invited entries from the public to submit a suitable design for the purpose, which can really reflect the trade culture and heritage of the city. According to Kudumbashree Mission officials who coordinate the project under the city corporation, the designs can be submitted by any professional or amateur artist or the general public within November 5. The project will give a uniform shape and colour to all pushcarts, they say. The redesigning of the conventional carts is also a part of the ongoing urban beautification projects and the new sanitation protocol implemented by the city corporation. Apart from helping ensure a sustainable livelihood for traders, their organised operations will also be made possible through such creative rearrangements in the conventional style of street trade. Efforts are also under way to issue special identity cards to all pushcart vendors. Some of them have already received their cards for lawful operation in permitted areas. On completion of the redesigning process, there will be efforts to identify special vending zones for such traders to carry out their business without interrupting the trade of other licensed traders in major commercial zones. According to the latest field survey report of the city corporation, there are 2,323 street traders in the city limit alone which include traders who make use of street bunks and pushcarts for their daily business. All these unorganised traders will have to be issued identity cards for trouble-free operations and to claim various government benefits. In one of the previous surveys, the corporation had identified 2,036 street vendors of which 1,682 persons had been issued special identity cards. The latest survey is a continuation of the previous activities to add more eligible beneficiaries under the upcoming schemes. The names of some of the ineligible candidates who made their entry into previous lists were also removed in the latest survey.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pushcarts-in-kozhikode-city-set-for-an-aesthetic-makeover/article37277474.ece

Sheeja Sasi, district panchayat president, will open the district-level launch of the ‘Praveshanolsavam’ at Government Higher Secondary School, Valayam. Classes would resume in 1,270 schools in the district. The Education Department authorities claimed that the safety of students would be ensured and the government’s COVID protocol would be followed in toto. Classes would be held in shifts and seating arrangements have been made according to the number of students. Thermal scanners, sanitisers, and face masks have been provided. Classes would be held only till the afternoon in the first two weeks. Saturdays, except when there are public holidays, would be working days. If there are over 1,000 students, only 25% of them would be present at a time in the school. Students would be divided into batches and each of them would be coming to school consecutively for three days. The next batch would come in the next three days. Differently abled students need not come. Steps have also been taken to avoid entry of parents into the premises and their crowding there while picking and dropping their wards. Participation of parents has been ensured in various monitoring committees for the transport of students. Children who are not well or those who are in contact with infected persons need not come. Also, students and school staff who have symptoms, those who are primary contacts, and from places where restrictions are in place should not venture out. Meanwhile, the Health Department claimed that it has already dispatched posters to create awareness on COVID prevention. District Medical Officer V. Jayasree has said that teachers should always remind students about the pandemic protocol and make sure that it is being practised.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/schools-all-set-to-welcome-students/article37277467.ece
01 November 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||One tablet could prevent leptospirosis after floods||A single dose of doxycycline 200 mg tablet is effective as a preventive medicine against leptospirosis, a bacterial infection, if given to the flood-affected within a week of the natural calamity. This was found in a case control study done by T. Jayakrishnan, Professor, Department of Community Medicine, Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Kozhikode, and Swathi Vipinan Koramboor, and Athira Thottathan, junior residents at the department. A case control study compares two groups of people: those with the disease or condition under the study (cases) and a similar group who does not have the disease or condition (controls). Titled ‘Post Flood Chemoprophylaxis with Doxycycline for Leptospirosis in an Endemic Area,’ it was published recently in the National Journal of Community Medicine . More than 1,000 leptospirosis cases are reported from Kerala every year, with 10% of the affected persons dying of it. The cases are showing an upward trend since 2015. Compared with an average 1,400 cases a year earlier, the figure rose to 2,200 in 2018 and there were more deaths too, mainly because of the devastating floods that occurred that year. Humans catch the disease when they come into contact with the urine of infected animals or a urine-polluted environment. The study was conducted to identify the risk factors of leptospirosis during an outbreak and to know the usefulness of doxycycline as preventive medicine to reduce the risks after flood. The period of the study was from September 1 to 30, 2019, two weeks after the floods in August. Forty patients admitted to the MCH and 47 caregivers were included in it. Farmers or those working in contaminated surface water are more prone to the disease, and wounds and injuries are factors that increase the risk. If doxycycline tablets are given immediately after the floods, they can reduce further risks and hospitalisation, the study says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/one-tablet-could-prevent-leptospirosis-after-floods/article37277499.ece
01 November 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Livestock under wild animal threat in Puthuppadi||Settler farmers from upland areas of Puthuppadi panchayat have appealed to the Forest Department to find a quick solution to the increasing attack of wild animals on their livestock, causing huge financial loss. They allege that the authorities are yet to turn their attention on the issue other than just continuing with the conventional procedures for assessing the crop loss related to the wild animal menace. In a memorandum submitted to the Kozhikode Divisional Forest Officer, leaders of various farmers’ organisations from the village said the continuing wild animal encroachment was badly affecting the self-employment ventures of many dairy farmers, and those running small goat farms. Those who suffer losses are not even getting the deserving compensation, they alleged. The fresh threat for many farmers in the village is the entry of the dangerous packs of wolves from the nearby forest areas. These beasts are mainly targeting goats. Though farmers approached the local forest offices for a solution, they too failed to support them. There were also many incidents in the area in which cows were attacked and killed by wild animals. An elderly farmer from the area said the entry of monkeys, wild elephants and wild boar was continuing to be a big challenge for growers of various fruit plants. “Officers living in the urban areas are hardly aware of the real struggle of farmers to survive these threats. When we raise complaints, many are not even feeling the real seriousness of the issues,” he lamented. ‘Pleas taken up’ Meanwhile, Forest Department sources said the complaints raised by farmers from various parts of Kattippara had already been taken up seriously for follow-up actions. In the first phase, all vulnerable areas would be protected using power fences and trenches apart from adopting other practical measures. They also pointed out that the wild boar menace had already been brought under control in several affected villages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/livestock-under-wild-animal-threat-in-puthuppadi/article37277469.ece

The causeway across Pampa, which leads to the location, remained submerged during the Minister's visit. Following this, he held discussions with the elected representatives and promised action to expedite steps to construct a bridge across the Pampa. Ranni MLA Pramod Narayan and District Collector Divya S. Iyer had already submitted reports in this regard to the Government, he said. “Whenever the level of water rises, the two banks of the river become isolated and inaccessible. Sometimes, people go to work on the other side and are unable to come back. The problem persists in a way that affects three colonies and there is no other way but a bridge,” said Mr. Rajan. The Minister also promised to communicate a request by the local residents to remove the soil and debris generated during construction works by the KSEB. Discussions were also held with regard to the accommodation of tribal families, while the District Collector has been entrusted with examining the possibility of issuing title deeds based on the previous survey report.

01 November 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||New departments in emerging areas for KU||The University of Kerala is set to add to its academic disciplines 10 new departments in strategic subjects that will provide facility for studies in emerging areas. Regarded the ‘mother university’ of the State, the 84-year-old establishment houses 44 departments out of which 11 came under the faculty of Science, seven under Science and Technology, and 26 under Social Sciences, Languages, Commerce and Education. The Syndicate recently granted approval to launch the departments of Communication Science and Electronics, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Data Science, Functional Organic Materials, Oceanography and Blue Economy, Public Health, Renewable Energy, Integrative Biology, Atmospheric Science, and Design. Before the Senate The proposals will now be laid before the Senate and later sent for the assent of the Chancellor. The university had last launched a teaching department (for Kerala Studies) in 2019. Pro-Vice Chancellor P.P. Ajayakumar pointed out the accreditation process and ranking systems prevalent in the country most often focus more on research outputs and funding from external agencies. Such factors favoured universities that ensured greater thrust on science and technology. Faculty strength Besides, an increase in faculty strength will enable more research scholars to pursue research, and also lead to an increase in project funding and publication. Hoping to launch courses in the proposed departments this year, the university will initially utilise its existing faculty and facilities for the new programmes. It envisages creating one post each for Professor and Associate Professor, and four for Assistant Professors in each of the 10 departments. VSSC Kerala University also hoped to leverage its proximity with Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) and other research centres in the capital to exploit the potential of disciplines such as Atmospheric Science. Design The proposed Department of Design, which is expected to strengthen the fine arts division of the university, could cover a wide range of subjects that could apply to different segments such as fashion design, interior design, and web design. The proposed Department of Public Health will focus on teaching and research programmes in biostatistics, environmental health sciences, epidemiology, nutritional sciences, population and health sciences etc. The Data Science department is likely to introduce fields such as cybersecurity, financial analytics and health analytics.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ku-to-launch-10-depts-in-emerging-areas/article37277537.ece

Mohammed Riyas carried out a surprise inspection at the PWD rest house in the capital, pulling up the staff for laxity in its upkeep. The manager of the facility was suspended following the Minister’s orders. The inspection was done to check whether the directives issued earlier to make the rest houses ready for the public have been carried out. After arriving at the rest house unannounced on Sunday morning, the Minister walked around the premises. Noticing that there has been no clean-up in recent days, with dry leaves and other waste piled up all around, he questioned the rest house manager as to why no periodic cleaning has been carried out. He later visited the kitchen and expressed disappointment at its condition. “It is now two months since the Government took a decision to improve the conditions at rest houses and open online booking. Would you keep this place clean only if the Minister comes after prior announcement? This cannot be allowed,” Mr. Riyas was heard telling the rest house manager, in a live video of the surprise visit, streamed on his Facebook page. Later, speaking to presspersons, he said that the Chief Engineer would be asked to take action against the officials who failed to maintain the rest house satisfactorily. “The PWD is opening its online booking facility at rest houses from tomorrow, with the support of everyone. We had issued clear instructions to all rest house officials to ensure cleanliness. However, it seems such instructions are not applicable here. I have carried out checks here and what I saw here can never be allowed.

01 November 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Many challenges as schools reopen after pandemic||The State is in the best position to open schools, with 70% of the adult population having robust natural immunity to the virus and an overall immunity (natural immunity and vaccine-induced) of 82.6%. Yet, unlike in other States where Delta virus ran riot, Kerala’s situation is unique in that a majority of our children - 60% - are still susceptible to infection. Thus, school reopening is a major activity which is likely to alter the current transmission dynamics of COVID-19. According to the latest study from U.K. in The Lancet (October 28), while the fully vaccinated individuals are at lesser risk than the unvaccinated (by 13%) of contracting the Delta infection, “fully vaccinated individuals with breakthrough infections have peak viral load similar to unvaccinated cases and can efficiently transmit infection in household settings, including to fully vaccinated contacts.” The study confirmed that the protective immunity of vaccines begins to wane within 2-3 months of vaccination. This context should be borne in mind when schools reopen, that a chunk of the population who have only vaccine-derived immunity, the small proportion of unvaccinated individuals and 60% of susceptible children can drive disease transmission up in the community. “Since March, we have been vaccinating chunks of our population. Given the property of waning vaccine immunity, most of the elderly who were vaccinated early as well as a good proportion of others who were vaccinated hence are now susceptible to re-infection/breakthrough infection and can transmit it efficiently too. While going ahead with school reopening, it is important that this complex situation is understood. Clear protocols for the close and consistent monitoring of the virus transmission dynamics should be laid out so that school reopening does not lead to an exponential increase in transmission,” a senior public health expert said. A spurt in cases and some clustering should be expected across the State when children go back to school but it should be ensured that the rise in transmission does not result in an increase in mortality. “COVID-19 in children is mostly asymptomatic and hence we are likely to miss cases. Managing potential cases and outbreaks, reducing transmission within households while protecting the elderly and vulnerable could be challenging,” pointed out S. Geetha, associate professor of paediatrics, Konni Goverment Medical College Hospital. Not much is known about the role of children in household transmission. Are schools equipped to manage specific situations when COVID-19 cases are reported in children; what are the contingency plans in place in schools when children test positive and the criteria for returning to schools after a student tests positive are some grey areas that need more attention,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/many-challenges-as-schools-reopen-after-pandemic/article37277510.ece

Home to 181 species of dragonflies and damselflies, the State also nurtures 68 species that are endemic to the Western Ghats. The study undertaken by Vinayan P. Nair, K. Abraham Samuel and Kalesh Sadasivan of Travancore Nature History Society and Muhamed Jafer Palot of Zoological Survey of India has been published in the latest edition of Entomon , a peer-reviewed journal issued by the Association for Advancement of Entomology. According to the study, the current checklist of odonates of the Western Ghats stood at 207, of which 80 species are endemics. A total of 181 species belonging to 87 genera under two suborders and 14 families were recorded within the geographical boundaries of Kerala. While the group initially compiled data on 169 species from scattered literature, the authors added eight species based on their personal records and publications. These odonate species include Amphiallagma parvum, Ceriagrion chromothorax, Platylestes platystylus Rambur , Pseudagrion australasiae Selys , Crocothemis erythraea, Protosticta rufostigma Kimmins , Protosticta sholai Subramanian & Babu , and Zygonyx torridus isis Fraser .  Another four species — Paracercion malayanum Selys, 1876 by Bo Nielson from Varkala, Indothemis limbata sita Campion, 1923 and Indolestes pulcherrimus Fraser , 1924 by Muneer PK from Wayanad; and Anax indicus Leiftinck, 1942 by Suhas R.K. from Chinnar— were also included from the personal records of other researchers. A landscape-based approach has been adopted to list odonata distribution along Agasthyamala, Periyar, Munnar, Nilgiri, Wayanad, and Coorg. According to the 2021 International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species, The State has an ‘endangered’ species ( Idionyx galeata ), four ‘near threatened’ and ‘vulnerable’ species each.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/first-statewide-odonate-study-reveals-181-species/article37277683.ece

Ashok, chairman and managing director (CMD) of the power utility. ''It is feasible. For the KSEB, it is also a business opportunity,'' Mr. Ashok said, after the KSEB disclosed power requirement estimations for the Rs. 63,941-crore project on Saturday following talks with the Kerala Rail Development Corporation Limited (K-Rail). Given the thrust on e-mobility, the energy requirement of the transportation sector in general is expected to go up, and the KSEB is actively exploring ways to cater to the emerging demand. Peaking power plants — plants operated when the electricity demand is high — are proposed at Moolamattam in Idukki and Moozhiyar in Pathanamthitta, the locations of the KSEB's biggest two power generation facilities, Mr. Ashok said. The KSEB is looking at 800-plus MW facility at Moolamattam, which will complement the existing 780 MW station. ''We have enough storage for powerhouse at Moozhiyar as well. The possibility is being looked into,'' he added. Mr. Ashok stressed the need for tapping potential sources within the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kseb-can-meet-power-needs-of-silverline-cmd/article37277507.ece

The sombre ceremony concluded by 8 a.m. Puneeth Rajkumar died on October 29 following a cardiac arrest. The coffin was taken to the final resting place in a procession through the city at the crack of dawn. For security reasons, the last journey from Sree Kanteerava Stadium began much before the publicly announced time. However, the funeral procession was greeted by hundreds of fans and well-wishers who had kept vigil through the night to pay their respects. Though they were not allowed inside the studios, thousands of people gathered outside raising slogans and crying “Appu Amara” as they bid farewell to the actor. The State police paid their respects with a 21-gun salute. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai handed over the national flag wrapped around the mortal remains of the actor to his wife Ashwini Revanth. After this, the family conducted the last rites. Vinay Rajkumar, elder son of Raghavendra Rajkumar, conducted the religious rituals as per the family tradition. Puneeth Rajkumar’s wife and their two daughters — Dhriti and Vanditha — held on to each other in grief. Shivarajkumar and Raghavendra Rajkumar wept uncontrollably as their brother was buried. Several prominent film personalities and politicians, including Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Siddaramaiah, former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, and KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar, paid their last respects. Thousands of fans gathered outside the studio in the hope of paying their respects. However, the State Government had barred entry of members of the public till further orders. Shivarajkumar and Raghavendra Rajkumar thanked the Government and fans for ensuring a peaceful farewell to their brother. In the wake of a few ardent fans reportedly ending their lives, they appealed to people to not harm themselves. “The show must go on, life will move on. We need to tolerate this sadness and move on. You are as important to your families as Puneeth was to ours, so please don’t take any extreme steps,” they said.  The show must go on, life will move on.

01 November 2021||CHENNAI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Tamil Nadu schools to reopen for Classes I to VIII today||A section of students of Classes I to VIII will be returning to their respective campuses on Monday, after a gap of nearly 20 months. The COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020. Though many institutions have decided to conduct physical classes by following the safety protocol, some have opted to wait and watch before following suit. While allowing schools to function, the School Education Department emphasised that the “happiness of students” was a priority. It has framed directives that will determine how the next few weeks will play out for students of government and aided schools. “Over the next 10 to 15 days, our focus will be on reminding students that schools are happy spaces and ensuring the environment remains welcoming to them. For students of Classes I and II in particular, who have never attended classes on campus, we are asking schools not to be rigid about timings, and allay the concerns of parents whenever needed,” an official said. The Directorate of Elementary Education stated that for a fortnight or so, the focus will be on encouraging students to participate in activities, including sharing of experiences, storytelling, music, dance and drawing. The State Council for Educational Research and Training (SCERT) has prepared a bridge course, which will be taken up after the first two weeks for all classes. A host of safety rules, many of which were implemented when schools reopened for students of Classes IX to XII in September, will be enforced. They include mask wearing and physical distancing at all times. “We will be resuming classes in a phased manner, and have Classes VI to VIII first on campus,” said Priyanka Ghosh, principal, Vikas Mantra Public School. Ms. Ghosh said the school had an academic planner in place for November, largely focused on activities and interactive sessions for children. “Instead of jumping head first into their textbook lessons, we will have activities based on listening, speaking, reading and writing skills for English and other language classes. Younger children in particular have not had much writing practice, and we will encourage them to write and complete the worksheets that they were previously attempting online,” she said. “For teachers, the mantra is to be patient with the children, give them a lot of breaks, and listen to what they have to say about being back in school,” she added. Many schools are planning to welcome students with colourful classrooms, music, sweets and new notebooks. “For the parents of some students of Classes I and II, who would like to wait on campus during classes for the first few days, we have readied space. One of the main concerns that were put forth was whether young students will wear masks for several hours, and we have decided to give them breaks, when they will be taken to an outdoor space and allowed to take their masks off for a few minutes while maintaining physical distance,” said N. Vijayan, patron, Unified Self-Financing Schools’ Association, and Chairman, Zion group of schools. P.K. Ilamaran, president, Tamil Nadu Teachers’ Association, said schools should consistently follow up with students about their physical and mental health and ask students to inform them if any of their family members develop symptoms of COVID-19. “All teaching and non-teaching staff across most schools have been vaccinated, and we have experience implementing safety norms when senior students returned to campuses in September. Some schools with less space have chosen to accommodate students of only two to three classes per day on campus to avoid crowding.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/classes-i-to-viii-to-reopen-in-tn-today/article37277211.ece

01 November 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Tiger poaching comes to light after a year||An incident of tiger poaching from a year ago came to light on Saturday when forest officials nabbed two persons trying to transport the tiger’s body parts near Kagaznagar of the Kumram Bheem Asifabad district. The incident comes on the heels of another similar operation in Mulugu district exactly four weeks ago, raising serious concerns about the safety of big cats in the forest reserves of Telangana State. In the latest operation which took place on Saturday evening, two persons named Kotnaka Dev Rao and Godugu Avinash were apprehended by the Forest Range Officer of Kagaznagar for possessing tiger skin. During enquiry, they revealed that the skin was being brought from Wadgaon village of Indravelli mandal in Adilabad district. Based on this information, special teams led by DFO, Adilabad, FDO, Utnoor and FRO of Kagaznagar raided the said village and nabbed four more persons, Mesram Manku, Mesram Deepak, Mesram Chandrakanth, Mesram Eeshwer and Mesram Laxman. Upon enquiry, it was revealed that the tiger skin was brought from Velgonda village approximately a year ago, where the tiger was trapped in a snare set up for wild boar in the cotton fields of one Penduru Dev Rao. A raid on Velgonda village on the same day unearthed more body parts of the big cat, including its lower jaw and bones from the house of one Pendur Mukund Rao. For further enquiry, eight more persons have been picked up from Velgonda and brought to Kagaznagar forest division office. They will be produced before the magistrate at Sirpur, a statement from the Forest department informed. Mild tension prevailed at Velgonda on Sunday when the forest officials raided the houses of the culprits. The village community protested at the officials storming their houses with shoes on since this time round they observe an annual religious affair of worshipping the God of soul with Deepavali round the corner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tiger-poaching-comes-to-light-after-a-year/article37277154.ece
01 November 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||First gay couple to tie the knot in Telugu States||It is another instance of two people living together formalising their relationship, says Hyderabad-based lecturer in hotel management Supriyo Chakraborty. Except the couple in this case are two men. Mr. Chakraborty’s wedding to his partner Abhay Dang on December 18 will be the first gay union in the Telugu States. The couple have secured the approval of their parents and plan to hold a celebration of their relationship without any marriage formalities, as the law still does not permit same sex marriages. But Mr. Chakraborty is sanguine about that too. Speaking to The Hindu , the 31-year-old Mr. Chakraborty is hopeful that just as queer relationships were decriminalised, marriage too will be allowed for queer couples. When that happens, they will register their marriage, he said. As of now, they'll have a ‘wedding’ to make their relationship official with the blessings of family and friends, but not the law. “It all started with texting each other on a dating app back in 2012 and and since then we have been together. A few months later we moved in and started living together, which helped us understand each other better. Two years later we bought an apartment of our own,” he said. The couple also have a third member in their lives, ‘Kaju’, a puppy. Mr. Chakraborty said they are blessed with very understanding parents, siblings, friends, and in his case, his students too. “Being Indian parents, initially they didn’t say yes to our relationship, and at the same time they did not object. They took a little time and just wanted us to be happy in our lives in our own way,” he said. When they started living together, the two weren’t out in front of everyone, but gradually they managed to make people understand that they are just like any heterosexual couple in the neighbourhood. While Mr. Chakraborty hails from Kolkata, Mr. Dang, a software development manager at an MNC, is native of New Delhi. Interestingly, the couple plans to have a ‘straight’ wedding starting from a haldi ceremony to a few of parties, and exchanging rings. The couple state that their wedding is just a celebration of togetherness, “and for celebration you don’t need a law.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/first-gay-couple-to-tie-the-knot-in-telugu-states/article37276963.ece

01 November 2021||IDUKKI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Rule curve level fixed by panel not maintained, says Minister||Agriculture Minister P. Prasad, who visited the Mullaperiyar dam along with Water Resources Minister Roshy Augustine on Sunday, said the rule curve level for the dam fixed by the Central Water Commission (CWC) had not been maintained. The upper rule curve level till October 31 was 138 feet and it had not been maintained, he said. “The Kerala Government is not opposed to giving water to Tamil Nadu for its agricultural purpose, but the safety of the people of Kerala should also be considered,” he said. Mr. Augustine said that Tamil Nadu was currently releasing 2,974 cusecs (cubic feet per second) from the dam to the Periyar and the water level dipped to 138.85 feet at 9 a.m. More water was released as the water level continued to increase after opening the three spillway shutters.He said the water level in the Mullaperiyar dam had not been maintained as per the Supreme Court-approved rule curve level and it would be informed to the apex court, He said the Chief Minister and the Revenue Minister were regularly monitoring the situation at Mullaperiyar. “Even if 7,000 cusecs of water is released into the Periyar, there is no need for concern as the Government had made all safety arrangements,” he said. The new rule curve level at 139.50 feet will come into effect from November 1. Mr. Augustine said the Water Resources Department would be allotted with a boat to monitor the situation at Mullaperiyar. The water level was nearing red alert in the Idukki reservoir on Sunday with 2,398.30 feet. The red alert level on October 31 was 2,398.31 and the upper rule level was 2,399.31. The new rule curve will be applicable in the Idukki reservoir also from November 1. The red alert level will be 2,398.78 and upper rule level at 2,399.78, said a KSEB official. As the rainfall was relatively poor on the catchment areas of Idukki dam and the inflow was less, the discharge of Mullaperiyar water did not make much of an impact, the official said. In the present situation, the need for opening the shutters of Cheruthoni dam of Idukki reservoir was remote, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rule-curve-level-fixed-by-panel-not-maintained-says-minister/article37276953.ece
01 November 2021||KADAPA,ANDHRA PRADESH||BJP alleges bogus voting in Badvel byelection||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders made charges of irregularities against the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) leaders in the bypoll to the Badvel (SC) Assembly constituency held on Saturday. Former Minister and BJP State vice-president C. Adinarayana Reddy accused the ruling party leaders of resorting to unethical practices such as bogus voting by bringing in the outsiders, doling out sops in proportion that was ‘unheard of’ and misusing the police machinery to intimidate the voters and booth agents. “The Ministers, MLAs and MLCs of the YSRCP violated the law by overstaying in the constituency. They flooded the Assembly segment with huge quantum of money. At least 50,000 non-locals without valid identity cards were given slips by the ruling party to cast their votes. Is this a way of winning an election in a democratic way?” asked Mr. Adinarayana Reddy. ‘Tirupati drama’ The party accused the YSRCP of enacting the ‘Tirupati drama with a revised script’ in Badvel, reiterating the charges made during the by-election to the Tirupati Lok Sabha seat early this year that ‘outsiders’ were brought in to cast votes. Mr. Adinarayana Reddy alleged that Kadapa Deputy Mayor Nityananda Reddy, a non-local in Badvel, was given the responsibility of an booth agent at Kosarajupalle village. He also accused the polling and police officials of complicity in the process. “The actual polling mark of 50% rose to 68.12% because of bogus votes,” said Mr. Adinarayana Reddy. He asked why the YSRCP had made so many leaders in-charges for the bypoll if it was not scared of the BJP’s impact. Maintaining that the BJP cadre had identified and chased away ‘bogus voters’ at several polling stations, he demanded that repoll be held in 28 centres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bjp-alleges-bogus-voting-in-badvel-byelection/article37277611.ece

Jogi Naidu on Sunday observed the early harvesting stage of ‘Amulya’ paddy variety during their field-level investigation in East Godavari district. They visited the paddy fields in Kakinada Rural, Pithapuram and Gollaprolu mandals and documented the early flowering and harvesting of the paddy variety. Mr. Jogi Naidu later apprised Agriculture Minister K. Kannababu on the current status of the crop. The scientists observed that the farmers who had preferred the variety could not transport the harvest from their fields as the surrounding fields with other varieties were in the flowering stage. Mr. Kannababu directed them to submit a report on their findings. The Minister said that the State government had already promised compensation to the affected farmers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/scientists-inspect-failed-amulya-paddy-crop/article37277640.ece

01 November 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||SC verdict in ‘Maoist’ case may impact trial in NIA court||The Supreme Court (SC) verdict in the Pantheerankavu Maoist case, releasing two youths on bail after rejecting the contentions of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), may leave an impression on the trial of the case, legal experts say. The apex court had last week allowed the bail plea of Allan Shuhaib and Thwaha Fasal, arrested for alleged Maoist links. The SC observed that there “was no prima facie material to show intention on the part of both the accused to further the activities of the terrorist organisation.” Sections 38 and 39 of the Act (offences relating to membership and support given to a terrorist organisation), did not appear to be prima facie true in the case, the court said. Though the Supreme Court had cautioned the Special Court not to be influenced by its judgement in the bail application, judicial sources felt that the spirit of the apex court order was likely to prevail over the trial procedures. Incidentally, the Special Court had also noted that there was no prima facie material to show intention of the accused to further the activities of a terrorist organisation, an essential ingredient to invoke the Sections 38 and 39 of the Act. However, if the trial court, after examining the materials before it, arrives at the conclusion that the offence has been prima facie revealed, the duo will be tried. Political debate The SC verdict has also triggered a political debate in the State as Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had earlier defended the slapping of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) against the youths. As criticism from within the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)], LDF partners, and the Opposition became louder, Mr. Vijayan wrote to Union Home Minister Amit Shah to transfer the investigation back to the State police. Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan has slammed the government stand in the wake of the SC order. M.A. Baby, the CPI(M) Polit Bureau member, who was vocal against the invoking of the Act in the case, felt that the apex court eventually delivered justice to the duo. The Centre took over the investigation in the case at a time when the LDF government was all set to review the invoking of UAPA in the case. Had the review happened, the two youths would have been released earlier, he said.  The SC observes there “was no prima facie material to show intention on the part of the accused to further the activities of the terror outfit”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sc-verdict-in-maoist-case-may-impact-trial-in-nia-court/article37276954.ece

01 November 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Bineesh Kodiyeri returns home||Bineesh Kodiyeri, son of former CPI(M) State Secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, who was lodged in a Bengaluru jail in a money laundering case over the past one year, returned home on Sunday, two days after the High Court of Karnataka granted him bail. After friends and party workers welcomed him at the Thiruvananthapuram International Airport in the morning, he told press persons that he had remained in jail only because he did not give in to the pressures of the Enforcement Directorate (ED). Promising to reveal more on the inside story of his arrest later, he headed to his house in Maruthunkuzhy, where Mr.Balakrishnan and other family members received him. “I am meeting my son after a year as I was unable to go and meet him in the jail. There is relief and happiness,” said Mr.Balakrishnan, who also said that the recent happenings in other States involving Central agencies such as the ED attests to the allegations against them. The ED, which had accused Bineesh of being involved in financing the drug business of Mohammed Anoop, the prime accused, and others involved, had arrested him on October 29 last year. Walking out of the Parappana Agrahara Central Prison on Saturday, he told press persons that ‘the country's biggest political party’ was behind his arrest. “The name Bineesh is irrelevant, the arrest happened because of the name Kodiyeri. Right from the beginning, they were not asking me any of the details regarding this case. The ED arraigned me an accused in this case because I refused to name people whom they wanted to be named. If I had uttered those names as they wanted, I could have walked out in 10 days. I have a lot of things to talk about regarding this case, which I will do once I reach Kerala,” he had said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bineesh-returns-home-after-a-year/article37276960.ece
01 November 2021||TIRUCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Batting for fruit bats, Sampatti residents say no to firecrackers||Sampatti village, located on the outskirts of Manapparai town, will remain tranquil this Deepavali, as it has for the past nine years — all for a lofty cause. The residents are playing samaritan to a large population of fruit bats nesting on a cluster of trees on the property of a farmer. A. Balraj shifted to a house nestled between large trees, near his ancestral property, years ago. The remains of a temple dedicated to his family deity too stands here, and from its ruins grow several large peepal trees, on which thousands of bats nest. When he began to live in the house, Mr. Balraj noticed that many people would come hunt the bats, especially during the day, when the mammals slept. The people in the area consumed bat meat. Mr. Balraj said he started offering the bats protection, thinking of them as his babies. “I provide them food through my fruit trees and shelter. They are safe here,” he says with pride. Sometimes the bats make a unique sound when they are hurt, and Mr. Balraj recognises it and rushes to check on them. He owns 10 acres of land around the trees, and cultivates various crops. He makes sure that crackers are not burst in the area. “Bats are very sensitive creatures. If you stand near the trees and clap or even rustle some leaves, they get disturbed. Firecrackers are very harmful to them,” he said. While several villagers protested, they eventually understood his intention and respected it. They, instead, light lamps and celebrate the festival by preparing food and offering prayers. Mr. Balraj’s family has second thoughts on renovating the ruined temple in favour of the bats. “We initially planned to rebuild the ruined structure. Since that would mean uprooting the trees and displacing the bats, our family decided to construct a temple near the old structure,” Mr. Balraj said, adding: “We have to make sure that the construction does not get too noisy, as the bats will get disturbed.”  Bats are very sensitive creatures. If you stand near the trees and clap or even rustle some leaves, they get disturbed A.

01 November 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||TTD plumps for organic products||The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) has taken a decision to procure products made by using ‘natural farming methods’ to meet its future requirements. The TTD procures grains and vegetables for making ‘prasadam’ at the Sri Venkateswara temple in Tirumala and to provide food to the devotees, students and patients daily at its institutions and hospitals. The announcement came from the TTD Chairman Y.V. Subba Reddy at the valedictory of ‘Gau Maha Sammelan’ on Sunday, where he assured to procure products such as rice, jaggery and turmeric grown without using chemicals. The national convention, in which 30 seers took part along with 3,000 farmers practising cow-based agriculture, aimed at propagating cow-based farming as a means to restore soil fertility and human health. On the ‘Gudiko Gomatha’ scheme that offers a cow and a calf to temples and mutts, Mr. Subba Reddy wanted the seers and Veda Pathasalas to come forward. He underlined the importance being given by the government to the farmers’ welfare and natural farming methods. Linking of ‘goshalas’ TTD Executive Officer K.S. Jawahar Reddy announced to link the 600 ‘goshalas’ in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana with the Sri Venkateswara Gosamrakshanasala, and extend them financial assistance. With 3,000 acres under natural farming, he exuded confidence that the TTD’s annual requirement of 6,000 tonnes of rice, 7,000 tonnes of pulses, and 6,000 tonnes of cow ghee could be easily met. Patanjali Yogpeeth founder Baba Ramdev seconded the TTD’s proposal to the Centre to recognise cow as the national animal. Apart from a request to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, he also appealed to all the Chief Ministers to support the cause. Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham pontiff Sri Vijayendra Saraswati performed ‘Go Puja’ in the ‘Godhooli’ event, which remained an attraction with native breeds such as ‘Kankrej’, ‘Punganur’, ‘Kangeyam’, Ongole, ‘Gir’, ‘Sahiwal’ and ‘Hallikar’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ttd-plumps-for-organic-products/article37276956.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy. Noothan Venkatesh Varma, an educated farmer from Tirumanyam Rajula Kandriga village in Vadamalapet mandal of Chittoor district, posted a picture of himself standing in the muddy road and holding a placard with a message to the Chief Minister. The message read ‘Respected CM Jagan sir, we need a proper road to my village and this can be possible under your leadership and promise’ by hashtagging the phrase #plspromiseJagansir. In another picture, he could be seen holding the national flag by standing ankle-deep in the same slushy road. Several villagers joined him to give vent to their ire in a series of videos posted by him. Mr. Varma had raised the issue in ‘Spandana’, the official grievance redressal system, for which he had received a response way back in July that the Panchayat Raj department’s Tirupati division had sanctioned Rs. 16 lakh for the cement road work. But no work has been taken up so far.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/farmer-takes-to-twitter-to-draw-cms-attention-to-bad-road-in-his-village/article37277172.ece

01 November 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||Commercial Taxes now under Buggana||The State government issued orders allocating the Commercial Taxes (CT) portfolio to Finance Minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy on Saturday. The portfolio was hitherto held by Deputy Chief Minister K. Narayanaswamy. With this, Mr. Narayanaswamy will be helming only Excise and Prohibition Department, while Mr. Rajendranath has Finance and Planning, Legislative Affairs, and Commercial Taxes under him. The government did not mention any reason for the transfer of the portfolio in the gazette notification. This was the second attempt to bring the Revenue and Finance departments under one umbrella. The government had made an attempt in July to bring the Revenue and Stamps and Registration (looked after by Deputy Chief Minister Dharmana Krishna Das) under the Finance Minister. It, however, revoked the G.O. The government had then said that it was effecting the changes to have more synergy of resource mobilisation with the Finance Department. In that G.O., all the related Heads of Departments and autonomous organisations such as the Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Director and Inspector-General of Registrations and Stamps, and the A.P. VAT Appellate Tribunal (Visakhapatnam) had been attached to the Finance Department. The proposal had hit a roadblock, as the departments were headed by two Ministers. The transfer of subjects was not easy as it had an impact on the portfolios of the two Deputy Chief Ministers looking after them. Later, the government had brought Planning under the Finance Department. The merger was to cut delays in developmental activities. It was a smooth transition as the political head of both the departments was the Finance Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/commercial-taxes-now-under-buggana/article37277613.ece

01 November 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Psychologists’ role in suicide prevention discussed||While treating patients with suicidal tendency, a psychologist should talk about suicide in a matter-of-fact way and avoid pejorative explanation of suicidal behaviour or motives, said psychiatrist Ayodhya R.K here on Sunday. Speaking on “Role of Psychologists in Suicide Prevention”, as part of an awareness programme organised by Guntur-based Spandana Eda International Foundation to mark International Stress Awareness week, Dr. Ayodhya said while dealing with such people, a psychologist should present the problem-solving theory of the suicidal behaviour and maintain the stance that it is a maladaptive and ineffective solution and other therapists should be involved in the treatment. He said despite best efforts to assess and treat patients with suicidal tendencies, suicides can and do occur. “Approximately 12,000-14,000 suicides per year occur while the patient is being treated,” he said. He said more number of women make suicide attempts but higher number of suicide deaths are registered among men. He said to ameliorate risk factors, psychologists should diagnose and treat the underlying psychopathology, use intervention strategies that address suicidal behaviours directly. Chairman of the Spandana Eda International Foundation E.

01 November 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Pawan Kalyan puts onus of saving VSP on YSRCP govt.||Jana Sena Party (JSP) president Pawan Kalyan has put the onus of saving the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) from the prospect of privatisation on the YSRCP government. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy should lead an all-party delegation to the Prime Minister and convince him to revoke the Centre’s decision, he said on Sunday. Mr. Kalyan was in the city to express his solidarity with the VSP workers, who had been on a relay hunger strikes for over 260 days under the aegis of the Visakha Ukku Parirakshana Porata Committee. Mr. Kalyan said 32 persons had laid down their lives for the plant. Farmers had vacated their villages and parted with lands, while employees had contributed to ensure profits for the plant despite non-allocation of captive mines, which put the VSP at a disadvantage , he said. He recalled that 62 MLAs and MPs of the combined State had resigned to their posts in protest against the police firing and demanding the establishment of the steel plant. “In contrast, the YSRCP, which has 151 MLAs and 22 MPs, is content with writing letters to the Prime Minister Minister and passing resolution in the Assembly , apart from holding protests in Delhi,” he said, adding that such ‘mild actions’ would not make the Centre understand the gravity of the situation. Mr. Kalyan said, “Before asking the Centre, the State government should be made responsible.” Giving one week time to the State government to announce the all-party delegation, he said if there was no response, a decision would be taken by other parties and trade unions to exert pressure on it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/pawan-kalyan-puts-onus-of-saving-vsp-on-ysrcp-govt/article37277617.ece
01 November 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Pawan Kalyan’s entry likely to strengthen VSP agitation||The ongoing agitation against privatisation of the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) has got a shot in the arm with Jana Sena Party (JSP) president Pawan Kalyan expressing his solidarity and agreeing to take it to the next level, provided he got support from all sections of the people and parties. The actor, who enthrals thousands of his fans with his histrionics on screen, must have bowled over seasoned trade union leaders and steel workers with his knowledge on steel production, genesis and growth of the VSP and the reasons for its losses. The JSP chief was in the city on Sunday to extend his solidarity to the striking workers of the VSP, who have been organising relay hunger strikes for over 260 days against the decision of the Union government on strategic sale of the VSP. His visit to the steel plant, has been the hot topic of debate among steel plant workers, trade unions and on social media for the past few days. Thousands of people participated in the public meeting held at the VSP and scores of others cheered him all along the route from the airport to the steel plant, when he went in a rally. A jumbo garland was lowered on him with the help of a huge crane at a junction during the rally, apparently by his fans. While his adversaries might dismiss his support to the VSP agitation as a ‘political stunt’ to gain the support of the people of Gajuwaka Assembly constituency, who had defeated him in the last general elections, he made no bones of his intention to stand by them in their hour of crisis. “Had you elected me or at least given our party some seats in Parliament, I would have had the strength to take up your cause. However, I am not here to run away from the problem and I will stand by you if all of you promise to give me the required strength till the end,” he said. It is often said that Mr. Pawan Kalyan is a voracious reader, but his knowledge about the VSP, is not something that all politicians, especially those from outside Vizag, can claim to possess. He recalled that Vizag was identified as the best place in the country when the then Industries Minister had proposed setting up of a steel plant. When the then Union government had decided to change the proposal and set up the plant in another State, people of Andhra Pradesh raised in revolt against the Centre. He called for another revolt on those lines to fight against the privatisation of the VSP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/pawan-kalyans-entry-likely-to-strengthen-vsp-agitation/article37277649.ece
01 November 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Tributes paid to Subramania Bharathi||Mahakavi Subramania Bharathi, who had changed the face of Tamil literature, through his poems and prose, kindling the spark of patriotism, social awareness and divinity, breathed his last on 11th September, 1921.

01 November 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||The trials and tribulations of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant||On November 1, 1967, which is celebrated as the Andhra Formation Day, T. Sanyasi Rao, then in his twenties, was discussing with his friends about how the agitation for the setting up of a steel plant in Visakhapatnam was shaping up and the success of the rail roko as part of which the Madras Mail was stopped near Gopalapatnam for 24 hours, two days ago (October 29), a message came to them that a hotel in the One Town was serving meals to the police and CRPF personnel deployed by the State government to quell the protest under the banner ‘Visakha Ukku – Andhrula Hakku’ . Mr. Sanyasi Rao and his friends rushed to the Old Town where thousands of people gathered on the road. They found their way to the front , only to be met with bullets fired by the police. Rajnala Pranakusha Das, a second-year student of Mrs. AVN College, joined another set of protesters . He took four bullets fired by the owners of private arms dealer, who thought that the mob was coming to loot the store. In total 12 persons including a nine-year-old boy died on that day . The incident did not create any fear among the locals, but pepped them up. Women and children came onto the roads shouting ‘Visakha Ukku Andhrula Hakku’. This iconic slogan shook the Centre, which finally accorded permission for the country’s first integrated shore-based steel plant in Visakhapatnam. “Though we were very young, the undercurrent was palpable and it cemented the resolve. The dead became the martyrs ,” says P.V. Sudhakar, Principal of Andhra Medical College, who is the nephew of Pranakusha Das. The agitation spread like a fire . In the next one week, 20 persons were killed in police firing including five in Guntur, five in Vijayawada, two in Vizianagaram, one each in Rajahmundry, Kakinada, Palasa, Warangal, Jagtial and Sileru and one each in two other places. “The VSP has not come without sacrifices,” says CPI (M) leader Ch. Narasinga Rao, who had not only been part of the protest as a teenager, but has authored a book titled ‘Visakha Ukku-Andhrula Hakku Mahodyamam’. The slogan is reverberating again, as the Centre has decided to put up the VSP for 100% strategic sale and the employees have agitating since the last 260 days. Ever since, T.Amruta Rao took up the fast unto death for the cause on October 15 the same year, the agitation took a different turn. Students of Andhra Medical College, Andhra University and Mrs. AVN College, joined the movement. Students, led by Kolla Rajmohan, then president of the AMC student union, staged the roal roko. “The rail roko was peaceful. Thousands had joined us. The protesters carried food, water and milk for the children stranded in the train. Even the passengers, who listen to our cause, joined the agitation ,” recalls Mr. Rajmohan. The prominent students leaders included M. Venkaiah Naidu, the Vice-President of India now, who was then a student at AU Law College and CPI(M) leader B.V. Raghavulu, Tenneti Viswanadham and Gouthu Latchanna. In 1963, MP C. Subramanian announced the setting up of a steel plant in Visakhapatnam. The foundation stone was laid by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1971 and the plant was dedicated to the nation by then Prime Minister V.P. Singh on March 20, 1990. Due to the delay in construction, the initial estimate of Rs. 1,900 crore had shot up to Rs. 8,000 crore. The Centre had given only Rs. 4,986 crore and the rest was raised from the market at a high interest. The VSP is yet to wriggle out of the debt . In 2,000, the plant was referred to the BIFR and in 2014, 10% disinvestment was proposed. Agitation by employees could save the plant. “This plant has been given a step-brotherly treatment. No government has sanctioned a captive mine to the plant till date,” says CPI leader J.V. Satyanarayana Murthy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/the-trials-and-tribulations-of-visakhapatnam-steel-plant/article37277620.ece

The YSRCP MLA said that there was no sanctity in Pawan’s words and people would not trust him, as he already got tagged as a ‘package star’. He also criticised Pawan Kalyan for not questioning BJP over the privatisation of the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant and objected to his supporting the BJP. Mr. Amarnath reiterated that the YSR Congress Party has always been opposing the privatisation of the VSP. Chief Minister Y.S.

01 November 2021||VIZIANAGARAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||A 70-year literary journey going strong||It has been an uninterrupted literary journey for Ravi Narasimha Avadhani since 1951. Mr. Avadhani, who was born on September 30, 1935 penned his first story Bratuku Tipi which was published in Chitragupta , a popular Telugu fortnightly in those days. He has since written nearly 800 stories, including Karnudu , Vagdanam , Pelli Picchi , Kanuvippu and novels Punadi Rallu , Sneha Bandham , Asha Jyothi , Neeli Needalu , Suryamani and Bandhalu-Anubandhalu among others. Even at the age of 86, he still writes many articles and stories for Vipravani , a house magazine of the Vizianagaram Brahmana Samskshema Samakhya. Mr. Avadhani, who worked in Garividi-Vizianagaram Ferro Alloys factory between 1956 and 1993 in various capacities including the senior deputy manager, says that he was inspired by his grandmother Peramma and parents Venkatramaiah and Suryakantamma who had good knowledge of Telugu literature “Stories convey a message in a simple way and bring the desired changes in society. Parents need to encourage children to read comics and moral stories which will ensure their overall development and make them good citizens,” says Mr. Avadhani who has received more than 100 awards, including one from the Madras Telugu Academy. Rare distinction On his completion of 70 years of literary journey, the Vizianagaram Brahmana Samakhya honorary president D.V. Srikanth felicitated him at a function here on Sunday. Mr. Srikanth, editor of Vipravani , said that Mr. Avadhani was probably the only writer in India to pen stories and articles continuously for 70 years.

01 November 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||INCOIS guides 9 lakh fishermen on potential catch sites||Hyderabad-based Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), under the Ministry Of Earth Sciences (MoES), which is involved in oceanic observations, research and advisories, is also directly in touch with stakeholders like the fishermen across the coastline. Daily messages Close to nine lakh fishermen are on the contact list for getting daily messages on their mobile phones on potential fishing sites and at what depths the catch is available with data based on sea surface temperatures, chlorophyll, sea currents and the likes. “For more than a decade, we have been able to help the fishermen improve the economics of fishing with advisories giving precise location of fish availability. This not only ensures a better catch but the usage of fuel is also less as they need not sail deep in search, thus reducing the time and overall expenditure,” explained INCOIS director T. Srinivasa Kumar. A commercially important fish like ‘tuna’ prefers a certain water clarity and certain level of oxygen for their body metabolism. So this helps in tracking their movements on the sea. Similar advisories are being developed for ‘hilsa’ variety too. The fish advisories are also put up on electronic display boards in fishing harbours in the respective local languages and on the websites, he said. Local measurements “Fishermen in each region across the coastline have their own unique depth calculations rather than metres. So, we give them information in local flavour measurements of ‘Phadham’ and ‘Barah’ for them to assimilate our advisories,” said Dr. Kumar. With regular ocean state forecasts, alerts on tidal wave heights, swells and so on, cautioning the fishermen, they are also assured of safety when they venture out. Enhanced accuracy Over the years with improved satellite imagery, telemetry studies and observations from various measuring instruments on sea, the accuracy of the advisories to the fishermen has been enhanced, including potential fishing prospects of species like ‘mackerel’ and ‘sardines’, said senior scientist and group director of Operational Ocean Services & Applied Research (OSAR) T. Balakrishnan Nair. The country’s coastline is divided into 12 sectors covering all the islands and the mainland with daily advisories referring to 586 specific landmarks/locations on both east and the west coast, he said. INCOIS also studies the Algal Bloom in the north Arabian Sea, Kochi, Gulf of Mannar and Gopalpur and the coral bleaching phenomenon by monitoring temperature, colour and other indicators. This is to give alerts and advisories as any change can directly affect the fishing activity and impact livelihood. The Coast Guard, Navy, Ports, Industry and voluntary organisations working with the stakeholders are also kept in the loop, added Dr. Nair.  This not only ensures a better catch but the usage of fuel is also less as they need not sail deep in search, thus reducing the time and overall expenditure. T.

He gave the instructions during a video-conference he conducted with the election officers to review the arrangements being made for counting of votes cast in the bypoll. The direction follows a complaint lodged by the Bharatiya Janata Party that there were irregularities in the movement of the election material and that the Telangana Rashtra Samithi leaders indulged in replacement of control units. They demanded that the Chief Electoral Officer order an inquiry by the CBI into the alleged lapses. Memo submitted Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders including D. K. Aruna, N. Ramachander Rao, Prakash Reddy, T. Raja Singh and others called on the Chief Electoral Officer and submitted a memorandum seeking a detailed inquiry into the alleged lapses.

01 November 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||De-addiction centres come to the rescue of regular ganja users||The widespread crackdown on ganja in and around Hyderabad for over a month is restricting peddlers from indulging in selling the contraband. And since ganja is in short supply now, the regular users will find it difficult to get their dose. This calls for the services of de-addiction centres that help people get over the ‘bad’ habit. Free de-addiction services are provided at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) in Erragadda. A few private health facilities in the city too, provide these services. Starting from the main suppliers to the peddlers, who deal in small quantities, Telangana Police and Prohibition & Excise department officials are trying to catch everyone. In an attempt to give a picture of how intense the crackdown is, sources in the Excise department said that they are even going after peddlers who deal with a few packets of ganja. “If someone tries to peddle, he will be caught. And many were held,” said sources in the department. The crackdown is going on in Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda police commissionerates. The Excise department’s Enforcement (Hyderabad) wing superintendent N. Anji Reddy said that apart from the regular users, who cannot spend a single day without ganja, they have come across youngsters who started taking ganja recently. “The recent users will be deterred, since it is next to impossible to buy ganja now. We offer counselling to those caught with ganja or while trying to buy it. In the case of regular users, guardians or parents of the youngsters should get them to the de-addiction centres,” he said. Superintendent of the IMH Dr. Umashankar said that addiction to cannabis is more psychological than physical.“It takes around two weeks to bring the withdrawal effects (of cannabis) under control. Thereafter, we offer psychological treatment,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/de-addiction-centres-come-to-the-rescue-of-regular-ganja-users/article37277438.ece
01 November 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||First in Telugu States: gay couple breaks stereotype, announces ‘wedding’||It is just a normal story of two people living together next door, but in this story there are two men, says Hyderabad-based hotel management school lecturer Supriyo Chakraborty, who along with his partner Abhay Dang, will announce their wedding to be celebrated on December 18, making it the first gay wedding in two Telugu States. The couple got the approval of their parents for their union and plan to hold a celebration of their relationship without any marriage formalities, as the law still does not permit same gender marriages. Mr. Supriyo is positive about that too. Speaking to The Hindu , 31-year-old Supriyo said that the way queer relationships were decriminalised, marriage too, will be allowed for queer couples. When that happens, they will register their marriage, he said. As of now, they will have a ‘wedding’ but not a marriage, which means they’ll make it official with the blessings of their family and friends, but not the law. Together since 2012 “It all started with texting each other on a dating app back in 2012 and since then we have been together. A few months later we moved in and started living together, which helped us understand each other better. Two years later, we bought an apartment of our own,” he said, with a joy filled mind. The couple also has a third member in their lives, ‘Kaju’, a puppy. Mr. Supriyo shares that they are blessed with very understanding parents, siblings, friends, and in his case, his students too. “Being Indian parents, initially they didn’t say yes to our relationship, and at the same time they did not object. They took a little time and just wanted us to be happy in our lives in our own way,” he said, adding that it will be the first gay wedding in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. When they started living together, the two weren’t out in front of everyone, but gradually they managed to make people understand that they are just like any heterosexual couple living in the neighbourhood. “Until the law was decriminalised, we were criminals,” he maintains. Regular rituals While Mr. Supriyo hails from Kolkata, Mr. Abhay, who works as a software developing manager at an MNC here, is from New Delhi, and the couple plans to have everything as in regular marriage, starting from ‘haldi’ to a few parties, and exchanging rings in a closed and selected gathering. “People say, both good and bad things about us. But, we tell ourselves that we are doing nothing wrong and should stand up together. This wedding will be an inspiration for many and as a teacher I have the influence of crafting the next generation,” Mr. Supriyo says. They also state that their wedding is just a celebration of togetherness, “and for celebration you don’t need a law.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/first-in-telugu-states-gay-couple-announces-wedding/article37277446.ece
01 November 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||KCR involved in the issue: Bandi||State BJP president Bandi Sanjay Kumar has accused Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao of being directly involved in the issue of alleged irregularities during trasnsport of VVPATs as the TRS was ‘scared’ of losing the bypoll. “Why were the machines removed surreptitiously without informing either the contesting candidates or the agents? Who has decided the VVPATs were not working? We have many doubts about this as these machines are supposed to be locked up in the strongroom,” he said. The TRS, by allegedly offering a lot of money for securing votes, had already made a mockery of the election exercise and with this “illegal diversion” of the VVPATs had only added to the dubious game being played by it, he charged. Many party leaders did a silent protest near the Gandhi statue across Telangana following this incident. Mr. Sanjay Kumar is scheduled to preside over a meeting of top leaders on Monday at the State office in which Union Minister for Tourism and Culture G. Kishan Reddy, national general secretary Tarun Chugh, national OBC morcha president K.Laxman, P.Muralidhar Rao and others are expected to participate. The bypoll result, political scenario and programmes to be chalked ahead are the points of discussion, said general secretary G.

The workshop is now the only third agency within the railways network to make them as such machines are also manufactured by private firms. These point machines of 143 mm and 220 mm are extensively used by the railways throughout its network. These machines provide the safe mechanism for changing operation of trains from one line to another by securely locking the relevant points ensuring least vibrations besides helping to improve speeds further, said senior officials on Saturday. The workshop has the capacity to make 3,250 such machines annually and is expected to meet the rising demand and lower the costs since it is being made in-house. The production will cater to the zonal requirements and also across the railway network as the machines need to be replaced every 12 years or after 3 lakh operations, said General Manager Gajanan Mallya appreciating the workshop in a press release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/mettuguda-workshop-to-make-key-machines-for-railways/article37277666.ece

He said the move would violate Article 324 of the Constitution which provided freedom to the Election Commission. Taking to Twitter, Mr Owaisi said, “The unified database will be used for NPR-NRC, electoral rolls, passports etc. Currently, these are all separate processes. For example, electoral roll enrolment is done by an independent body, ECI. Now Union govt can allow birth/death register to be used for enrolment.” The Hyderabad parliamentarian said that in the Puttaswamy privacy case, the Supreme Court had struck down efforts to link Aadhaar with telecom and banking services. “Here it is being used to expand the use of birth/death registration to Aadhaar, voter enrolment, NPR etc. The right to privacy includes the right to be protected from such acts where data is collected for one purpose (in this case, birth registration) and used for other purposes, not expressly authorised by the person giving their data (NPR, voter enrolment, etc).”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/owaisi-concern-over-birth-registration-act/article37277462.ece

High turnout Speaking to reporters here on Sunday morning, Mr Reddy said the Huzurabad by-election saw a high voter turnout of 86.64% owing to active participation of voters in the by-election. During the mock poll early on Saturday morning, a voter-verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) unit developed a technical glitch in polling station number 200, he said, adding that the defective VVPAT was replaced with another voter-verifiable paper audit trail kept in the reserve by the sectoral officer. After the end of polling, the presiding officer along with the sectoral officer and the polling staff brought the EVMs in an RTC bus to the reception centre at the SSR Government Degree and PG College in Karimnagar, the designated counting centre, with police escort. While the defective voter-verifiable paper audit trail was being taken from one government vehicle to another government vehicle by a government driver for storing it in the designated godown as per the stipulated guidelines, a person recorded it and posted it on social media, he said, calling upon people not to believe rumours being spread on social media. All the EVMs (ballot units and control units) used in Saturday’s polling were stored under tight security in the strongrooms at the SRR Government College, which were sealed in the presence of candidates/agents, District Election Officer R V Karnan and election observers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/appeal-to-parties/article37277459.ece

01 November 2021||Mysuru,TELANGANA||Farmers to be dissuaded from cultivating ginger||Farmers in Mysuru district will be dissuaded against cultivating ginger and encouraged to shift to horticultural crops or sericulture. This is consequent to the crash in ginger price due to glut in production besides the realisation among the authorities of the environmental impact of ginger cultivation. The production entails heavy usage of chemical fertilizers and pesticides which reduces the yield and fertility of the soil. Ginger is generally cultivated on a contract basis by farmers with deep pockets from Kerala on leased land in Mysuru, Chamarajanagar, Shivamogga and other places. But over the last few years local farmers who saw the economic remuneration reaped by contractors from Kerala, sniffed an opportunity in ginger production and also entered the fray. As a result, the area under ginger cultivation increased and production went up resulting in a price crash. “While a 60 kg bag of ginger used to cost around Rs. 4,000 to Rs. 5,000 two years ago, it has plummeted to Rs. 400 at present,” said Vivek Cariappa, a farmer from HD Kote belt. The issue also came up during a review meeting of various departments in the district conducted by the Mysuru MP Pratap Simha here recently. He said the application of pesticide was high and the local farmers were not only in dire straits due to the price crash but the land fertility and yield had also taken a hit. The Agriculture Department was urged to conduct a series of awareness drives to goad farmers to shift to horticulture and sericulture. Mr. Simha said that efforts were being made to provide a local market for cotton cultivators by seeking a textile park in the region so that local cotton cultivators could have access to market. Mr. Cariappa said HD Kote belt was traditionally a cotton area but in the last few years there was a shift towards ginger. While ginger prices have crashed leaving the farmers in the lurch, cotton prices have skyrocketed due to lack of production, he added. The issue of the local farmers getting trapped in the vortex of market forces has led to a renewal of demand for local planning of agriculture. “The need of the hour is to have district-level agricultural plans so that the farmers can avoid the pitfalls of glut in production of one crop,” said Mr. Cariappa. There are also concerns that the chemicals and pesticides used for ginger production will impact the groundwater quality besides polluting the river through the seepage from the fields which enters the river in the downstream. Krisnaprasad of Sahaja Samruddha, an organisation propagating organic and natural farming, said the run-off from fields enters the waterbodies in the downstream area and contaminates the ecosystem which is fraught with danger in the long term.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/farmers-to-be-dissuaded-from-cultivating-ginger/article37277593.ece
01 November 2021||SANGAREDDY,TELANGANA||Treatment at seed level yields result||Mochi Pandari is a farmer from Tadkal village in Kangti mandal of Narayanakhed area. He has about three acres of land. For the present season he is cultivating bengalgram. Last year with the advice of agriculture officers, he treated bengalgram seed with Trichoderma viride bioagent and the result was astonishing. Though it would not increase the crop yield, it would arrest crop loss. That was what he experienced. “Treating the seed has saved us about 1.5 quintals of crop for us which translates into saving of about Rs. 6,000 per acre. We are able to save about Rs. 18,000 worth crop last year for three acres. This year also we have treated the seed before sowing it so that it addresses any soil-borne diseases,” Mr. Pandari told The Hindu on Sunday. During Yasangi of 2019, bengalgram was cultivated in 23,410 acres in Sangareddy district followed by 29,975 acres in 2020. “Trichoderma viride is a potential bio-control for soil-borne diseases. Trichodrema viride is a fungus and biofungicide. It is used for seed and soil treatment for suppression of various diseases caused by fungal pathogens. Bioagent will not increase the yield but this agent is capable of controlling the wilt disease completely. Trichoderma available at Rs. 30/ Rs. 40 per 250 gram packet. It is sufficient for one acre seed and can save from loss of yield of one to two quintals,” said Agriculture Extension Officer (AEO) G. Santosh, adding that they had distributed Trichoderma viride for 50 acres. With government suggesting that farmers opt for other crops instead of paddy, it was estimated that the crop sowing may go beyond 30,000 acres in Sangareddy district alone and any active role by farmers can save crop worth Rs. 18 crore, said the agriculture extension officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/treatment-at-seed-level-yields-result/article37277673.ece
01 November 2021||November 01 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||Reading between the lines?||The recent remarks of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao at the plenary of Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) that he had received thousands of representations from people of Andhra Pradesh urging him to launch the party in their State took a new twist digging into its import. Telangana Congress committee president A. Revanth Reddy was quick to point out that Mr. Rao and his AP counterpart Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy were out to merge the two States. Andhra Pradesh Minister Perni Nani went a step further and asked Mr. Rao to move a resolution in Telangana Assembly wanting merger of the States. This must prelude any move on the part of Mr. Rao to launch a party in Andhra Pradesh. Finally, the Congress MLA of Sangareddy T. Jayaprakash Reddy capped it all, saying he was always for united Andhra Pradesh before its bifurcation and that he would welcome the merger. War of letters The Telangana government and the Godavari river management board were involved in a war of letters after the former furnished detailed project reports (DPRs) for half a dozen projects in the river basin. Raising several questions on water availability and water use for the projects, the board had been shooting off letter after letter to the government. Actually, the board was supposed to study the detailed project reports and send them to the Central Water Commission and the Central government for getting clearances. The correspondence between the two sides back and forth had become a major irritant to engineering officials of Telangana. They now aver that the board had exceeded its brief. It had no powers to go into so many details.     It’s now time for allegations after the voting for the Huzurabad byelection is completed and the focus this time is on the campaign on social media. Parties are now complaining against one another on how morphed videos are being circulated on social media to draw the voters’ attention to the alleged “irregularities” by ruling and opposition parties. While there was a video on BJP leaders allegedly distributing covers containing money on Saturday, TRS leaders lodged a complaint on how voters’ were being thrown into confusion by circulation of a video of election meeting addressed by T. Harish Rao. The video was of an election meeting addressed in Dubbak which was now being circulated by BJP leaders as if it were uring the Huzurabad campaign.  (N. Rahul and M.

Mr. Banerjee addressed his first public rally in Tripura after 2016 with a restricted audience of 500 to respect an order of the High Court of Tripura. The TMC had moved the High Court after the police made attempts to shift the rally venue from outside space of Rabindra Satabarshiki Bhawan to a sports ground citing coronavirus risk. Former West Bengal Minister Rajib Banerjee, who was a member of the national executive committee of the BJP, also rejoined the TMC at the venue. He had quitted from the Ministry and the party ahead of the Assembly elections held this year. Mr. Rajib’s return to his old party in Tripura attains significance as indications suggest that he will be given an important responsibility. Mr. Das, who was considered close to former Health Minister Sudip Roy Barman, did not speak at the rally. Mr. Das was elected from Surma constituency in Dhalai district in 2018 polls and recently he made his intentions clear to leave the bJP. “It was known to everyone he (Das) will be leaving. Departure of one or two people will not have any impact on the BJP,” State Information Minister Sushanta Chowdhury said t a press conference convened to counter allegations of Mr. Abhishek.

01 November 2021||CHENNAI,||Leaders flay govt. over T.N. Day||AIADMK coordinator O. Panneerselvam on Sunday came down heavily on Chief Minister M.K. Stalin for having announced that July 18 would be celebrated as Tamil Nadu Day. Mr. Panneerselvam recalled the decision taken by his party, while in power in 2019, to observe November 1 as Tamil Nadu Day, as it was considered appropriate, in view of the present State coming into being on that day in 1956, following the re-organisation of States in the country. Accusing the Chief Minister of seeking to change the AIADMK regime’s decision out of political grudge, he said Mr. Stalin had cited Tamil scholars as having urged him to make July 18 Tamil Nadu Day, as it was on the day in 1967 that the Assembly adopted a resolution to rechristen Madras as Tamil Nadu. Later, Parliament adopted a law in 1968 and the State got its present name on January 14, 1969 . “Even if one is to go by the argument of the Chief Minister, only January 14 should be marked as Tamil Nadu Day,” he said, terming the Chief Minister’s logic “inappropriate and unfair”. Moreover, the move is an attempt to distort history, as it will now mean that the State took birth 11 years later than when it actually did, he said. “This is against tradition,” he said. Tamil Nadu got its present limits on November 1, which was also being celebrated by other States that branched out from the then Madras State as their formation day, he said. Mr. Stalin should take back his announcement and continue with the practice of observing November 1 as Tamil Nadu Day, he said. AMMK general secretary T.T.V. Dhinakaran also urged Mr. Stalin to withdraw his announcement.  BJP State president K. Annamalai said that only November 1 should be observed as Tamil Nadu Day. VCK general secretary Sinthanai Selvan said: “Our leader Thol. Thirumavalavan welcomes the State government’s announcement. At the same time, we feel the controversy over the date should be resolved by building a consensus.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/leaders-flay-govt-over-tn-day/article37277362.ece

The two-page order said, “In view of the various directions of the National Green Tribunal and the Supreme Court, there would be a total ban on the sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the 14 NCR districts.” The order said the bursting of crackers could affect the respiratory health of vulnerable groups. Exceptions outside NCR Outside the NCR, in the cities and towns in Haryana with “moderate” or below air quality as per the average ambient air quality in November last year, green crackers can be burst between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. on the day of Deepavali. For Chhath Puja, crackers can be burst for two hours from 6 a.m. However, community bursting of firecrackers will be promoted in these areas. The District Magistrate, Gurugram, on Saturday allowed bursting of green crackers from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. on November 4. People thronged the cracker shops on Sunday, oblivious of the fresh directions. “I read in the newspaper about the directions allowing a two-hour window for bursting of crackers.

Taking a dig at the ruling BJP, Mr. Yadav said that the party has only one thing to do — renaming works carried out by the previous SP government. “The BJP is inaugurating all works done by the Samajwadi Party. ‘Baba mukhyamantri’ is an amazing Chief minister who has not inaugurated any work done by his government,” he said, referring to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. All sections of people have made up their minds to elect an SP government in the Assembly elections, following which Uttar Pradesh will get back on the path to growth and prosperity, he added. “The BJP is remembering the Iron Man of India, Sardar Vallabhai Patel, today. But if it walks on the path shown by Sardar Patel, then the three farm laws, which it has enacted, should be withdrawn. This will be a true tribute to Patel,” the SP chief said. Mr. Yadav said Patel fought for farmers and hence, is known as ‘Sardar’ and ‘Iron Man’. ‘Farmers unhappy’ “The BJP claims that it is walking on the path shown by Sardar Patel, but today the farmers are the saddest,” he said. Farmers’ income has dipped, there is price rise and the way this government is functioning, every section of society is feeling insulted, the SP chief alleged. People across the country paid tributes to Patel on his 146th birth anniversary on Sunday. He was born on October 31, 1875 at Nadiad in Gujarat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/people-of-up-have-made-up-their-minds-to-elect-sp/article37277526.ece
01 November 2021||New Delhi,||HC relief to IAF officer in job scam||The Delhi High Court has granted bail to an Indian Air Force (IAF) officer who was caught running a recruitment scam for employment in the IAF and the Indian Railways. Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar said the chargesheet has already been filed in the case and a co-accused, with similar charges against him, is also on bail. The HC also took into account that the accused, Corporal Chakravir Chaudhari, has been in judicial custody since January 8. Mr. Chaudhari along with a civilian, Than Singh, was found to have duped a large number of people by promising them jobs and swindling Rs. 2.7 crore from them. As per the status report, during the course of investigation, statements of 18 victims were recorded. The victims said that the duo had collected originals as well as photocopies of their educational certificates and also taken Rs. 2.7 crore from them. The two accused, then, issued forged/fake call letters and joining letters to the victims. The public prosecutor said that the allegations against the accused are grave and serious in nature. The court, however, said, “No receipt has been brought on record by the prosecution to show that the alleged transaction of Rs. 2.7 crore from several aspiring candidates were made by the petitioner [Mr. Chaudhari]...” “Rather it is mentioned in the status report that all the transactions were in the form of cash without any receipt which is a matter of trial and cannot be looked into at this stage,” the HC said. It also directed Mr. Chaudhari not to leave the country without the trial court’s permission and not tamper with the evidence or threaten the witnesses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-relief-to-iaf-officer-in-job-scam/article37277349.ece

01 November 2021||November 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Clothes maketh the story||In her introduction to “A King’s Gambit”, a one-of-a-kind exhibition showcasing the original costumes of Satyajit Ray’s Shatranj Ke Khilari , curator Indrani Majumdar fondly describes the opening sequence of the film where a hand reaches across the chessboard and makes a move. Another hand, this time from the opposite end, appears a second later to counter it. “The woven silk sleeves and ornate rings of the players are the only indication that the scene is set in a bygone era,” says Majumdar. As the camera zooms out to bring the two players — Nawabs Mir Roshan Ali and Mirza Sajjad Ali — into focus, what strikes you first is the grandeur of it all — the rich backdrop, lavish decor, stylish artefacts, and the magnificent costumes worn by the indolent royals. Apart from the beleaguered poet-king, Lt.-General Sir James Outram, Captain Weston and Doctor Fayrer also find faithful representation in the clothes that they don. The costumes reflect the detailed and fastidious research that went into the production. On display are a wide range of achkans, angrakhas, jamas, pyjamas, shararas, ornate cholis, turbans, pagris, silver ornaments, and footwear from producer Suresh Jindal’s personal collection, preserved over the years in steel boxes with camphor squares. Describing Ray as a “phenomenal researcher”, Jindal says when it came to research and learning anything new, Ray had the “curiosity and inquisitiveness of a child”. Majumdar says that Ray drew from the English translation of Abdul Halim Sharar’s Lucknow, The Last Phase of an Eastern Culture . “It took a top craftsman of Agra three months to do the embroidery on the green robe of Wajid Ali Shah. The shararas that Shabana (Azmi) wore were stitched by poet Ali Sardar Jafri’s sisters. A whole collection of priceless heirloom shawls was loaned to us by Thakur families of Calcutta,” shares Jindal. A lot of credit for rendering the authentic feel goes to Shama Zaidi who not only transliterated Ray’s English script with Javed Siddiqui but also took care of the costumes. “Apart from her grooming in theatre, Shama, of course, hails from the milieu and understands the ecosystem. She had the first-hand experience of seeing and handling the costumes that were required,” says Jindal, who knew her from her theatre days. A lot of information, Jindal says, came from the paintings of the era. The Kathak scene, in particular, was inspired by an engraving of that period. The Salar Jung Museum, the Falaknuma Palace of the Nizams of Hyderabad and the City Palace Museum of Jaipur were the primary sources for the film’s research. Archival images available at the erstwhile Bourne & Shepherd photographic studio in Calcutta were another significant resource. The Victoria Memorial offered an oil painting of Wajid Ali Shah, which acted as the primary reference for the king’s physical appearance. “All British costumes were hired from Nathan and Berman, London, the largest costume hirers for film and stage in Europe,” says Jindal. After an elaborate consultation with the National War Museum in London, Andrew Mollo, a British expert on military uniforms, did the sketches for the military costumes. “Richard Attenborough (who played James Outram) brought them with him as personal baggage and carried them back with him. He researched that Outram smoked cheroots and purchased them himself from a famous tobacconist in London,” recalls Jindal. Many casually label Shatranj Ke Khilari as a Hindi film but it is in Urdu and Awadhi dialect and it reflects in the Censor Certificate. It also means Ray, for the first time, was working with a language and culture that was not exactly his own. “Of course, he was concerned about making his first non-Bengali film. But in Shama and Javed, he had the right support to guide him on the diction and mannerisms. Ray was a giant of a man in all possible terms but he was equally humble and open to suggestions.” Jindal, who co-produced Gandhi, says Attenborough carried the same trait on the sets . He also had a team to guide him on “diction and mannerisms”. Saeed Jaffery was Ray’s choice, while Jindal suggested Sanjeev Kumar and Amjad Khan for their star value and theatre background. “It was not that Ray was not aware of their strengths. He watched all kinds of cinema and was a regular at the International Film Festival of India in Delhi.” It also reflects in his choice of casting veteran actor Veena as Wajid Ali Shah’s mother. In those days, film sets often became a wrestling ring between competent actors, but Jindal says “Saeed and Sanjeev were too secure in their craft to get into a wrestling match”. The film manages to bring out the conflicting layers in Wajid Ali Shah’s personality, which English historians often fail to appreciate. When the Company was berating him as incompetent, Wajid’s poetry was being sung on the streets of Awadh. “During his time, Awadh was the biggest contributor to the Company’s coffers. Lucknow and Muslims, in general, loved the film as Wajid is a very loved figure in their history,” says Jindal, who also produced landmark films, Rajnigandha and Katha . Appreciating the detailing of costumes in Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Bajirao Mastani and Padmavat , Jindal says the role of costumes has moved a lot since then but such exhibitions are rare in India. “I hope more such exhibitions can be held all over our vast and rich land to inspire pride in our people for their incomparable heritage in fabric design and related crafts.” ( A King’s Gambit: Chess, Costumes and a Crown is on display at the India International Centre, New Delhi, till November 5)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/clothes-maketh-the-story/article37277357.ece
01 November 2021||HONG KONG,||China grapples with challenges of slowing economy, outbreaks||China’s government is grappling with twin challenges of weaker-than-expected economic growth and fresh COVID-19 outbreaks, just as the country’s leadership prepares for a key Communist Party conclave next week. After months of a strong recovery, China’s factory activity in October slowed, the second straight monthly contraction, as the economy reels from a power crisis, the fallout from troubles plaguing a highly leveraged real sector, and increasing costs of raw materials. Meanwhile, the country, which has followed a stringent “zero Covid” strategy and continued to maintain strict curbs on international travel while the rest of the world opens up, is now reeling from the biggest outbreak in months. Close to 400 cases have been reported in the last two weeks — a small number compared with the rest of the world, but the spread of the outbreak in multiple provinces has led to stringent lockdowns, further squeezing the economy. The twin challenges confront the Communist Party ahead of a key leadership meeting next week. The Communist Party’s Central Committee will gather in Beijing — which has also reported new COVID-19 cases — on November 8 for an annual gathering called a plenum. The sixth plenum assumes particular significance as one of the last major meetings before next October’s once-in-five-year leadership congress, when General Secretary and President Xi Jinping is expected to begin his third five-year term. The plenum will serve as a platform for Mr. Xi, who scrapped the previously in place ten-year term limit, to ensure support before the congress and ensure the appointment of his acolytes. Many senior officials, including second-ranked Premier Li Keqiang, are expected to retire next year. The holding of the plenum next week, coupled with likely concerns over COVID-19, prompted Mr. Xi to skip the G20 in Rome and the COP-26 climate summit in the United Kingdom, which is being attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, U.S. President Joe Biden and other world leaders. Mr. Xi has not left China since a visit to Myanmar in mid-January 2020, a few days before he ordered the lockdown in Wuhan where the COVID-19 outbreak first began. While the Communist Party will bank on its now tried-and-tested approach of stringent lockdowns and mass testing to stamp out the current outbreak, the economic costs of China’s “zero-COVID” approach are adding to economic pressures. Power crisis China’s official National Bureau of Statistics said on Sunday the contraction in manufacturing activity in October was on account of a power shortage affecting large parts of China and rising raw material prices. Supply constraints in China’s coal mines coupled with surging coal prices have led to blackouts and forced rationing of power supply in industrial belts. A commentary in the official Xinhua news agency that was widely circulated in the official Chinese press last week highlighted ten pressing challenges facing the Chinese economy, which grew 4.9% in the third quarter of this year, down from 7.9% in the second quarter. The commentary said the government “would wean the economy off its dependence on the property sector and debt”, and it highlighted power cuts and the real estate crisis as short-term challenges and the need to ensure “common prosperity” as a longer term challenge, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported. ‘Common prosperity’ Mr. Xi faces a balancing act of pressing ahead with his avowed plans to restructure the Chinese economy through what he is calling a push for “common prosperity”, including moves to curb the growing sway of major private sector firms especially in the tech sector and to reduce debt in the real estate sector. Among the measures his administration has taken in the past year includes anti-monopoly investigations into Alibaba, curbs on the highly lucrative private education sector, and warnings to real estate firms such as the Evergrande group that they cannot expect bailouts even as they face defaults. The moves have wiped out close to $1 trillion in market value of major Chinese private sector firms. At the same time, Mr. Xi needs to keep the economy ticking ahead of next year’s congress and to control the COVID-19 spread, which the Party’s official media in the past year has trumpeted as a major triumph of the China model compared to the West. The Party media has also been hitting out at calls for more open investigations into COVID-19’s origins and has even suggested the coronavirus outbreak came from the U.S., all to protect the Party’s image and push back against criticism from overseas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-grapples-with-challenges-of-slowing-economy-outbreaks/article37276897.ece
01 November 2021||Cairo,||UN urges Sudan Army to reverse coup||The UN secretary general urged Sudan’s coup leaders on Sunday to reverse their takeover of the country, a day after tens of thousands of people took to the streets in the largest pro-democracy protest since last week’s coup. Antonio Guterres said the generals should “take heed” of Saturday’s protests. “Time to go back to the legitimate constitutional arrangements,” he said in a tweet. He was referring to a power-sharing deal that established joint military-civilian rule following the ouster of longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir and his Islamist government in April 2019. The UN envoy for Sudan, Volker Perthes, said meanwhile that he met on Sunday with Abdalla Hamdok, the deposed Prime Minister who remained under house arrest in the capital Khartoum. “We discussed options for mediation and the way forward for Sudan. I will continue these efforts with other Sudanese stakeholders,” he said. Mr. Guterres expressed concern about violence against protesters on Saturday, calling for perpetrators to be held accountable. At least three people were shot dead when security forces opened fire on protesters in Omdurman, a city adjacent to the capital of Khartoum. A doctors’ union also said more than 110 people were injured by live rounds, tear gas and beatings in Omdurman and elsewhere in the country. With Saturday’s deaths, the overall number of people killed since Monday’s coup rose to 12, according to the Sudan Doctors’ Committee and activists. Gen. Abdel-Fattah Buhran, who led the coup, has claimed that the takeover was necessary to prevent a civil war, citing what he said were growing divisions among political groups.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/un-urges-sudan-army-to-reverse-coup/article37276906.ece
01 November 2021||Dubai,||UAE urges citizens to leave Lebanon ‘as soon as possible’||The UAE on Sunday called on its citizens in Lebanon to immediately return home, a day after recalling its diplomats from Beirut over a Lebanese Minister’s remarks on the Yemen war. “In light of current events... the Foreign Ministry calls on all its citizens in Lebanon to return to the UAE as soon as possible,” it said in a statement. “The Ministry has taken all necessary measures to facilitate the return of its citizens,” it added. In an interview recorded in August and aired this week, Lebanese Information Minister George Kordahi said Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen were “defending themselves... against an external aggression”, sparking a diplomatic row. A Saudi-led military coalition that has included the UAE intervened to prop up the Yemeni government in 2015, after Houthi rebels seized the capital Sanaa in 2014. Saudi Arabia on Friday gave Lebanon’s Ambassador 48 hours to leave the country, recalled its envoy from Beirut and suspended all imports from Lebanon. Bahrain and Kuwait quickly followed suit with similar measures, and the UAE on Saturday recalled its diplomats from Beirut in “solidarity” with Riyadh. ‘Insulting’ remarks The Saudi Foreign Ministry said its moves were taken after the “insulting” remarks on the Yemen war, but also due to the influence of Lebanon’s Iran-backed Shia movement Hezbollah. The UAE’s statement came shortly after Mr. Kordahi said that resigning was “out of the question”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/uae-urges-citizens-to-leave-lebanon-as-soon-as-possible/article37277129.ece

Mr. Kishida’s Liberal Democratic Party and its junior coalition partner Komeito together were expected to win between 239 to 288 seats in the 465-member lower house, the more powerful of Japan’s two-chamber Diet, public broadcaster NHK’s exit poll showed. The LDP alone was expected to win 212-253 seats, with Komeito gaining 27-35 seats, according to the projections. Their combined seats will exceed a parliamentary majority of 233 — but a loss from 305 seats previously. “The lower house election is about choosing a leadership,” he told NHK. “With the ruling coalition certainly keeping the majority, I believe we received a mandate from the voters.” Mr. Kishida said the projected loss of seats are in part due to Opposition parties’ strategy of fielding unified candidates in many single-seat electoral districts, but also because of voters’ judgement of his predecessors over the past four years. Mr. Kishida, 64, was elected PM on October 4 after winning the leadership race in his party, and dissolved the lower house only 10 days after taking office.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/japans-ruling-coalition-to-maintain-a-majority/article37276901.ece

01 November 2021||November 01 2021 00:00 IST,||The Court’s order on Pegasus still falls short||On October 27, the Supreme Court of India appointed an independent committee to inquire into charges that the Union government had used the mobile phone spyware Pegasus to invade, access, and snoop into devices used by India’s citizens. The Court’s direction has been met with adulation. But the time to sing our paeans is not yet here. Much as the Court’s declarations of law brim with brio, its order still falls short of delivering justice. No guarantee still Faced with the Government’s resolute refusal to file a proper affidavit, either confirming or denying the use of Pegasus, the Court, one might have thought, would have issued a writ compelling the state to adduce evidence. Instead, it left the fact finding to a committee of experts. There is no guarantee that a government that chose to remain silent before the Court will now somehow come clean before an external panel. The question then is this: should the Government fail to cooperate, how must the Court respond? The petitioners before the Supreme Court relied on an investigation conducted by a consortium of global media. These reports revealed that hundreds of phone numbers from India had appeared on a global list of more than 50,000 numbers that were selected for surveillance by clients of the Israeli firm, the NSO Group. The NSO has since confirmed that its spyware is sold only to governments, chiefly for the purposes of fighting terrorism. The petitioners said that forensic analysis had confirmed the presence of Pegasus on the devices of at least 10 Indians, including some of those before the Court. Time-tested strategy But the cases presented a set of familiar challenges. In response to the allegations made against it, the Government invoked its most-beloved bogey: national security. It effectively claimed that the interests of the country’s safety meant that it was under no obligation to tell the Court whether it in fact used the software or not. What is more, according to it, the very adoption of this argument virtually forbade the Court from probing further. This is a strategy that has worked well in the past. In matters purportedly involving national security, the Court has shown an extraordinary level of deference to the executive. The cases also posed another hurdle: a contest over facts. The petitioners were asserting the occurrence of illegal surveillance. The Government was offering no explicit response to their claims. How then was the Court to unravel the truth? Again, in recent times, the Court has invariably veered towards rejecting claims made against the state on the basis that it cannot decide the veracity of a pleading without conducting a full-fledged trial, the conduct of which is beyond the bailiwick of constitutional courts. Now, to some degree, in its order appointing a committee, the Court has bucked the trend of absolute deference. The Court has held that there is no magic formula to the Government’s incantation of national security, that its power of judicial review is not denuded merely because the state asserts that the country’s safety is at stake. A clear path of accountability The order recognises, correctly, that spying on an individual, whether by the state or by an outside agency, amounts to an infraction of privacy. This is not to suggest that all surveillance is illegal. But, as the order concludes, any limitation on a fundamental right must be proportional and based on evidence. “In a democratic country governed by the rule of law,” the judges hold, “indiscriminate spying on individuals cannot be allowed except with sufficient statutory safeguards, by following the procedure established by law under the Constitution.” In holding thus, the Court has effectively recognised that an act of surveillance must be tested on four grounds: first, the action must be supported by legislation; second, the state must show the Court that the restriction made is aimed at a legitimate governmental end; third, the state must demonstrate that there are no less intrusive means available to it to achieve the same objective; and, finally, the state must establish that there is a rational nexus between the limitation imposed and the aims underlying the measure. The test provides a clear path to holding the Government accountable. But for a coherent application of these standards the Court must arrive at a conclusion on facts. Ordinarily, in prerogative proceedings, evidence is taken on affidavit. In other words, the parties before the Court present their version of the facts through a sworn, written statement. The Court then appreciates the evidence to arrive at a deduction. In the cases concerning Pegasus, each of the petitioners affirmed a set of facts, claiming that mobile phones of Indian citizens — from journalists and activists to politicians — had been subject to intrusion. In response, the Government refused to file anything more than what it described as a “limited affidavit”. Apart from a general denial of the petitioners’ case, this affidavit, the Court found, did not “provide any clarity as to the facts of the matter at hand.” For the Court The absence of a categorical denial from the Government, the order holds, ought to lead to a prima facie belief, if nothing else, that there is truth in the petitioners’ claims. Having held thus, one might have expected the Court to frame a set of specific questions demanding answers from the state. These might have included the following: did the Government purchase Pegasus? Did it use the software on the phones of Indian citizens? If so, was such use backed by law? What were the reasons for which the use was authorised? If answers to these questions were still not forthcoming, elementary principles of evidence law allow the Court to draw what is known as an “adverse inference”. A party that fails to answer questions put to it will only risk the Court drawing a conclusion of fact against it. If, on this basis, the petitioners’ case is taken as true, there can be little doubt that there has been an illegitimate violation of a fundamental right. The Court then can grant any number of remedies: it can make a declaration that the Government was in the wrong; and it can issue a writ compelling the Government to disclose all materials relevant to the purchase and use of Pegasus. It is, therefore, unclear why we need a committee at all. Surely, the Court possesses the power to gather evidence on its own, to even allow, in exceptional cases, for cross-examination of important witnesses. A committee might well be necessary where the task of collecting evidence is somehow beyond the Court’s remit. But that is not the case here. Ultimately, in the future, the Court must think more carefully about questions of proof and rules of evidence. Ad hoc committees — sterling as their members might be — cannot be the solution. Far too many cases are consigned to the back burner on the appointment of external panels, and, in the process, civil liberties are compromised. For now, it is encouraging that the Court has kept these cases on its docket. If it finds in eight weeks’ time, when the cases are next scheduled to be listed, that the Government has been delaying or obstructing the committee, it must proceed to use its prerogative powers to both provide a declaration of illegality and issue a mandatory order to the state compelling it to perform its constitutional duties. Only then will the Court’s various eulogies to the values of privacy have any true meaning.

As SARS-CoV-2 has shown, a virus is a force to be feared. “Everything about viruses is extreme, including perhaps, the reactions they evoke,” says Lal as he profiles this abundant life form with the help of photographs, illustrations, anecdotes and paintings. An excerpt from the book:  Much as we baulk at the idea, we are not unique. The human species, like all other living things, is an amalgam of creatures pieced together, gene by gene, and passed down by different life forms over deep time. Our genes were handed down to us from our ancestral ape, monkey, pig, shrew, gecko, fish, worm, grass, moss and bacterium, with several other creatures in between. Without genetic mutations, there would be no humans or, for that matter, any other life form that we see around us. These mutations — tiny errors in replicating the genetic code — occur randomly each time a cell (or virus) makes copies of itself, thereby becoming the starting point for an unexpected evolutionary journey. A very tiny number of mutations successfully create variation in a population. Natural selection then amplifies traits and creates variants which eventually can evolve into distinct species. These changes could be anything that confers an ability to thrive better in an evolving environment — blending a chameleon more effectively into a forest that is drying up; extending the necks of okapis and gerenuks so they can more easily nibble on the overhanging foliage of tall trees; or simply helping microbes evade a strong immune response and allowing them to attach themselves to a cell. Genetic monsters Viruses together with other microbes speed up the gene exchange between similar and often unrelated life forms. From a virus’s perspective, all living creatures are genetic Frankenstein’s monsters that they have stitched together. Nearly 8% of our genes, for instance, are uniquely viral in origin, and despite thousands and millions of years of adding, editing and deleting genes, we remain genetically similar in many ways. A virus is capable of crossing over into us to cause infection because some of our shared genes, proteins and common cellular components enable it to establish itself. Take SARS-CoV-2, one of our most recent chance encounters. A few generations ago, a population of viruses acquired changes in their genes (and proteins) from an animal host which provided them with the ability to infect humans. The virus binds to a protein receptor, ACE2 (or Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; angiotensin is a protein hormone that causes blood vessels to become narrower and is vital for maintaining blood pressure and fluid balance in the body), which it recognises in us. ACE2 is found in several mammals, and in us they are primarily present in our lungs and guts. When virologists teased open the RNA of SARS-CoV-2, they found that it carried genes that are found in a variety of animals – in other viruses, bacteria, slugs, small mammals, and perhaps unsurprisingly, therefore, nearly 94% of its genes are found in humans too. But a handful of its genes are completely unique to it and their functions are yet unknown. This makes it difficult to predict how SARS-CoV-2 will behave once it enters our bodies.  Our technological progress, our ability to acquire instant (albeit often ephemeral) gratification, has lulled us into believing that we possess enough power to subdue and manipulate nature. We choose which relationships we want to foster and which we will cull and sever, and try to make nature serve us selectively and indefinitely. This kind of brinkmanship makes us feel that we can control nature, but as we have been slow to realise, this control is delusional. It is time we stopped looking at nature as a pliable variable or as an entity that impedes ‘progress’, or a tool of one-upmanship. I say this now because there are controversies about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 – did the virus jump from an animal to unsuspecting buyers in a wet market or did it leak from a lab? Was it designed as a bioweapon? For me, these questions are relevant only if we have the courage to take corrective action and hold institutions or governments accountable. Otherwise this is a futile blame game best left to politicians and diplomats. The origin of the virus could be significant for science if it helps us determine the virus’s lineage and identify its potential hosts which will help us plan future strategies. Regardless of how it originated, SARS-CoV-2 reminds us that provoking nature beyond a point can lead to unimagined and irreversible consequences. Anyone who understands nature’s processes knows that soils, mud, detritus, mulch, sand, gravel, grit and rock are crucial pieces in the climate change story, as are the ocean currents, wind circulation, the shapes and size of land masses and, of course, life forms – especially microbes, the principal primary energy producers on Earth that regulate the bulk of Earth’s carbon-oxygen cycle. When all these small pieces come together, they power Earth’s engines. This engine is an enormous, planetary scale, biogeochemical reactor – but it starts from small things. Viruses cause a billion infections a second. They tinker and shuffle genes at great speed, creating possibilities of making new varieties of life. Like geological processes which create and shape diverse landscapes, viruses and microbes enable speciation and find ways to fit new entities within ecosystems that their predecessors have shaped. Each ecosystem — a tropical forest, a vast grassland, a small pool or even microbiomes within every individual creature — has been thousands and even millions of years in the making, and is constantly evolving. Here to stay Like any other pathogen that established itself as a persistent disease, SARS-CoV-2, too, was a chance occurrence. We enabled its crossover through destruction of habitats and trade in wildlife. And once the outbreak occurred, mass movements of people, weak and bigoted science, the fragmented response by agencies, a blunderbuss of regulations and distrust between states sustained the spread and evolution of the novel virus. For SARS-CoV-2, the pandemic is not just a one-off chance but an evolutionary moment. The effects of the pandemic will not wear off any time soon. The virus has triggered massive changes starting with our bodies and embracing the body politic and these will probably stay with us for a very long time. Perhaps forever.

01 November 2021||November 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Getting nutrition back on the school high table||With COVID-19 cases reducing in the country, several establishments, including schools, are opening again. While the reopening of all schools is on the anvil, the festive season ahead and the fact that children are not yet in the ambit of the vaccination drive are causing apprehension. We, as a society, must focus on the nutrition of children to ensure they are armed with good immunity as they get ready to take on new challenges especially after emerging from the confines of their homes. However, It is important to remember that even before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, India was facing significant nutritional challenges. Hence, there is a need to pivot on children’s nutrition, using the novel coronavirus pandemic to better understand current nutrition and nutritional requirements for a healthy body and mind. Tackling India’s triple burden India faces multiple problems of under-nutrition and overweight/obesity coexisting with deficiencies of micronutrients such as iron, zinc, calcium and several vitamins. This triple burden of malnutrition has to be identified, understood and addressed. It is much more important especially in the case of children and adolescents as it is during these phases of life that we see rapid growth of the body and development of food habits. Childhood and adolescence are two conjoined periods of continuous growth and development — a seamless duration. For instance, between two and 10 years of age, children tend to grow at an average of 6-7 cm in height and 1.5 to 3 kg in weight every year. But specifically, when the growth spurt happens at about 10-12 years in girls and two years later in boys during adolescence, their nutritional needs are vastly increased. In the case of girls, their nutritional status impacts not only their health but that of generations to come. Malnutrition in any form can put children and adolescents at risk of compromised immune function, thus making them vulnerable to infections. Social factors To understand and foster their immunity, one also needs to understand disruptive social environment factors that affect diet quality. In urban as well as among middle class and affluent communities, restricted movement, constrained socialisation and even dwindling physical contact have become the new normal. COVID-19 isolation and fatigue have led to generalised stress, adding to the immunity challenge for children. These challenges coupled with a lack of diet diversity leading to imbalanced micronutrient intake or consumption of high carbohydrate and high sugar foods, endanger the child’s health by compromising their immunity and making them vulnerable to infections. Hence, the way we approach nutrition needs to change. Need for a balanced diet It is essential to look beyond minimum calorie requirements and ensure children consume a balanced diet with adequate diversity in order to ensure the required balance of all necessary nutrients. Providing children with a balanced diet packed with all the necessary nutrients provides them with a solid foundation for an active and healthy life. Often overlooked, micronutrients are essential for production of enzymes, hormones and other substances for good immune function, healthy growth and development. Each stage of the body’s immune response relies on the presence of many micronutrients. To combat hidden hunger, affordable, accessible and diverse food sources must be made available across India. Micronutrients that are primarily available in fruits, vegetables, greens, nuts, legumes and whole grains play a crucial role in enhancing the native and adaptive immune function and also aid ‘immune memory’ formation. A substantial serving of fresh fruits and vegetables, as much as about 300-500 gm per day per child is recommended depending on the age group. These, along with curd and nuts, can increase beneficial probiotic bacteria in the intestine. But it is better to help them choose fresh fruits rather than fruit juices. Thoroughly cooked meat/poultry and sea fish are very good for protein; sea fish also provide essential fats. About 300ml-400 ml of milk or curd can provide the required calcium, good quality protein and other nutrients. Among urban and affluent groups, indulgence in frequent munching of high-calorie snacks and sweetened beverages that are devoid of beneficial nutrients should be discouraged. However, fats need not be seen as a villain — children and adolescents need about 25g-50g a day, which should ideally be derived from more than two varieties of oils. Maintaining ideal body weight, regular physical activity, adequate water intake along with adequate sleep and low screen time can go a long way in building and regulating their immunity. Noon meal scheme The Pradhan Mantri Poshan Shakti Nirman Yojana (PM POSHAN) — the mid-day meal programme in its new avatar — is all set to broad base itself even to students of pre-primary levels or Bal Vatikas of government and government-aided primary schools along with primary and upper primary schoolchildren who are already within the ambit of the mid-day meal programme. The PM POSHAN envisages providing 450 Kcal energy and 12g of protein for primary; 700 Kcal and 20g protein for upper primary children through diet diversity. In addition, monitoring haemoglobin levels of schoolchildren, appointment of nutritional experts to ensure the haemoglobin and growth status are continuously monitored; focus on nutrigardens are all welcome steps as we prepare to reopen schools. Moreover, special provisions for nutritional items for children in districts with high prevalence of anaemia and the involvement of farmer producer organisations and self-help group women will strengthen linkages and convergence for promoting children’s nutrition.  COVID-19 or no COVID-19, good immunity will lay the foundation for long-term well-being. After all, good nutrition, safe food, and positive lifestyles are the cornerstones of great immune function. To ensure this, schools, when they reopen, should be avenues for teaching nutrition as a life skill than rhetorical pedagogy. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that our children are nurtured and nourished. Dr. SubbaRao M. Gavaravarapu is Scientist E and heads the Nutrition Information, Communication and Health Education (NICHE) division at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Nutrition (ICMR-NIN), Hyderabad.

01 November 2021||November 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Living on death row with illness||Last month, ‘Deathworthy: A Mental Health Perspective of the Death Penalty’, an important report by Project 39A, based at the National Law University, Delhi, was published. It explores the mental health concerns of death row prisoners, the intellectual disabilities they have, and the psychological impact of being on death row. India remains among the 55 retentionist countries where the death penalty is still handed down for certain crimes. Data on how many death row prisoners have mental health conditions and/or intellectual disabilities are hard to come by (because the prisoners are not specifically assessed for it) and so this report helps to improve our understanding of this much-neglected topic. No right to fair trial The report presents the detailed histories of 88 death row prisoners in India. Of them, 30 were found with a depressive illness, 19 with anxiety disorder, and three prisoners reported having psychotic episodes. Of particular concern is the fact that eight had attempted suicide and close to 50% said they had considered it. Worryingly, nearly 11% of these death row prisoners were diagnosed with intellectual disabilities and most of them had deficits in intellectual functioning. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights calls upon countries “not to impose the death penalty on a person suffering from any form of mental disorder or to execute any such person”. Yet, the laws of most countries don’t explicitly prohibit this. Mental illness and intellectual disabilities complicate the death penalty. Persons with mental illness and intellectual disabilities may not be able to instruct their lawyers to mount a robust defence, thus jeopardising the right to a fair trial enshrined in our Constitution. The ‘insanity defence’ in the Indian Penal Code sets such a high barrier that it can’t be met in most cases. Even when there is an obvious history of mental illness, courts in India are usually unwilling to consider the plea of insanity by defence lawyers. In State of Maharashtra v. Santosh Maruti Mane (2014), the Bombay High Court, while confirming the death penalty for a man who had gone on a bus rampage that claimed nine lives, and rejecting his insanity plea, had stated, “Mere prior incidence of treatment is not sufficient. It has to be established that at the time of commission of an offence, the accused was of unsound mind and incapable of understanding the consequences of his action”. It is impossible for any psychiatrist, days or weeks after the offence was committed, to certify that the above conditions existed at the precise moment the offence was committed. In Shatrughan Chauhan v. Union of India (2014), the Supreme Court had said that mental illness should warrant the commutation of death sentence to life imprisonment. Despite this, courts do not consider mental illness as a mitigating factor when imposing punishment. The report also highlights another important and neglected aspect of mental illness: the social determinants of mental illness. Mental illness is more common among the poor and those with mental illness are more likely to end up in poverty. Those who have experienced childhood abuse are significantly more likely to experience mental illness in adulthood than those who did not. The report provides an insight into the poverty, abuse, neglect and violence that mark the overwhelming majority of death row prisoners with mental illness. It sheds light on the stigma, social ostracisation and grief of families of those sentenced to death. Adopting a psycho-social approach The authors argue that courts should take a psycho-social approach towards sentence mitigation using the framework recommended by the Supreme Court in Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab (1980). The apex court had laid down guidelines that courts should take into consideration before imposing the death penalty. These include mental health issues such as “extreme mental or emotional disturbance” at the time of the incident and acting under “duress”. A psycho-social approach will allow courts to take into account the life history of an individual and relate this to the mental state of the individual. The report says, “We have sentenced to death people, who, due to the nature of their disability, might very well be exempt from the death penalty altogether.” Society, especially those in the criminal justice system, including legal and medical professionals, should mull over this. Mental illness is not a crime. Those with mental illness are vulnerable to violation of their rights. We need to ask ourselves what purpose is served by executing people who have a mental illness or an intellectual disability. This report, one hopes, will trigger these discussions.

01 November 2021||November 01 2021 00:00 IST,||The DMK’s gubernatorial test||The DMK, an ardent advocate of federalism, has always questioned the role of Governors. DMK founder C.N. Annadurai likened the Governor’s role to a goat’s beard, saying both were unnecessary. The dismissal of the M. Karunanidhi government on the recommendations of Governor K. K. Shah during the Emergency further hardened the DMK’s stand. In 2018, as Leader of the Opposition and DMK president, M.K. Stalin demanded that Governor Banwarilal Purohit resign over his alleged attempts to undermine the state’s autonomy through “district visits”. Against this backdrop, a recent letter to heads of departments by Chief Secretary V. Irai Anbu intimating them that Governor R.N. Ravi “wished to know about the functioning of certain departments” and the “ongoing welfare schemes of both the State as well as the Union government” has stirred a controversy. Mr. Stalin has not said anything about the letter yet. However, the DMK’s allies — Congress and Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi — have questioned the Governor’s authority in seeking reports from State government departments. The Governor can only be briefed by the Chief Minister, just as the President is briefed by the Prime Minister, they contend. DMK spokespersons, though, have tried to walk a tightrope arguing that Mr. Ravi’s actions are distinct from that of his predecessor, who directly interacted with officials. The Chief Secretary clarified that his communication requesting the secretaries to prepare presentations for the Governor was “routine” and described the debate on his letter as “unnecessary”. Nevertheless, the development points to a political situation created by a strong government at the Centre. The appointment of Mr. Ravi, a former Intelligence Bureau officer, as Governor had created suspicion within the DMK and among its allies. They felt that he had been sent to Tamil Nadu to checkmate the DMK government, which had referred to the Central government as the ‘Union’ government arguing that ‘Union’ “signifies federal principles”. Perhaps to dispel preconceived notions, Mr. Ravi, soon after being sworn in, said he would function within the parameters laid down in the Constitution and hoped to make his relationship with the DMK government “as beautiful as possible”. The DMK government, however vocal it is on federalism, cannot afford to antagonise the Governor, that too so early. Tamil Nadu was witness to the bitter battle between Governor M. Channa Reddy and Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in the mid-1990s, with the latter claiming that he had acted “without decency” when she called on him at the Raj Bhavan in August 1993. Since 1996, the relationship between the Raj Bhavan and the Secretariat have largely been cordial. The DMK, which shared power at the Centre from 1999 to 2013, made use of its clout and got Surjit Singh Barnala appointed in 2004. Karunanidhi shared a special relationship with Barnala as the latter had refused to recommend the dismissal of the DMK government in January 1991. The emergence of the BJP as a ruling party at the Centre with a brute majority has turned the clock back for the DMK. Governors in Opposition-ruled States are unlikely to sign on dotted lines. Although the AIADMK was an ally of the BJP, Mr. Purohit had refused to endorse all its policy decisions. A case in point was the AIADMK Cabinet’s recommendation to release the seven life convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. Mr. Purohit kept the file pending for ages and finally washed his hands of it and sent it to the President. Now, the fate of the DMK government’s Bill to admit students to undergraduate medical courses without NEET, which was sent to the Raj Bhavan so that it could be forwarded to the President, remains unknown. The DMK’s commitment to its core values and its ability to resist future interventions of the Governor, other than constitutionally obligated interactions, will be put to test in the coming months. kolappan.b@thehindu.co.in vijay.kumar@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-dmks-gubernatorial-test/article37276895.ece
01 November 2021||November 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Underestimated utility||That as many as 21 of 35 States/UTs have utilised, by October 29, over 100% of their allocated funds under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) for FY2021-22 is not a surprise. In the previous year, the allocations for MGNREGS were increased by Rs. 50,000 crore to meet the demand for work, with the Revised Estimates for spending for the scheme going up to Rs. 1,11,500 crore. MGNREGS was a life-saver for the poor, especially migrant labourers, following the sudden lockdown announced by the Union government. In this year’s Budget, the Finance Minister allocated Rs. 73,000 crore for the scheme, which was higher than the previous year’s absolute number in Budget allocations, but this amounted only to 2.1% of the Budget expenditure, the lowest outlay in those terms in the last six years. By October-end, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh had utilised more than 130% of their respective allocations for the scheme, indicating the extent to which rural workers depend on the scheme even in relatively better-off States. Clearly, the Union government has underestimated the demand for work under the scheme, which even if it involves arduous and menial labour has accounted for a large chunk of rural employment at a time when the economy suffered a steep contraction due to the effects of the pandemic. In response to a report, officials in the Rural Development Ministry accused States of “artificially” creating demand, but this has not been borne out from ground reports which continue to indicate rising demand for work and wages in rural India; civil society activists claim that some workers have been turned away by officials despite the demand for work because of the paucity of funds. The Union Government must ensure that the allocation is adequate for wage payments to be done and for demand to be met in the remaining months of this financial year. The utility of MGNREGS as a scheme that alleviates distress has never been in question. From acting as an effective substitute in the absence of crop and weather insurance in aiding poor farm households and helping to provide wages during agrarian crises, to being an avenue for employment during the economic crisis induced by the pandemic and the response, MGNREGS has turned out to be a salve for farm workers and labourers. Delays in wage payments could also result in a decline in rural consumption, which plays a vital role in stimulating the economy. Besides the scheme’s utility in distress, it also has the potential, if works are upgraded suitably, to continue to improve rural development and infrastructure. The Union Government must consider this during allocations and not be conservative in its outlay or remain unmindful of the overall potential of the scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/underestimated-utility/article37276877.ece
01 November 2021||November 01 2021 00:00 IST,||The big push||In what appears to be a rush to the finish line but is in fact the intention to fulfil long-standing policy promises of the Democratic Party, U.S. President Joe Biden sought to push through Congress an omnibus mega-bill seeking $1.85 trillion for social security and climate change. While the initiative seemed to be thrust forward on a shorter timeline so that Mr. Biden could speak of his domestic agenda achievements at the G20 meeting in Rome and COP26 in Scotland, the once-in-a-generation bill speaks to issues such as providing universal pre-kindergarten, extending an expanded tax credit for parents, further reducing health-care premiums for those covered under the Obama-era Affordable Care Act, reducing a waiting list for in-home care, building a million units of low-income housing, and worker training and higher education. To balance the implied considerable hike in federal public expenditure, the bill proposes to raise revenue via a 15% minimum tax on the reported profits of large corporations, clamping down on profit-shifting by multinationals, tighter enforcement for large corporations and ultra-high net worth individuals, a 1% tax on corporate tax buybacks, an additional 5% tax on incomes exceeding $10 million a year and another 3% tax on incomes above $25 million, and policies to limit business losses for the very wealthy and a 3.8% Medicare tax on people earning more than $400,000 a year who did not previously pay that tax. Although Democrats have 50 Senators in the Upper House of Congress and Vice-President Kamala Harris could cast a tie breaking vote should the need arise, the passage of this bill which will be remembered as a major component of Mr. Biden’s legacy, hangs on the razor’s edge. This is in part because at least two Senators, from Arizona and West Virginia, are potential holdouts. The conundrum that Mr. Biden is facing is a paradox of omnibus bills — different constituents view only some parts of the bill as desirable. For example, House Democrats appear unwilling to pass a version of the bill that the Senate has already cleared, sanctioning a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package. Lawmakers such as Pramila Jayapal have opined that the Congressional Progressive Caucus would only support the broader vision of the Build Back Better Act, which includes the ambitious climate change programme, federal paid leave for families, a substantial expansion of Medicare policy and two free years of community college. To succeed, Mr. Biden will have to negotiate with all stakeholders to find a compromise formula. At stake is the U.S.’s prospect of climbing out of the recessionary economic trough it was pushed into by the pandemic, not only by directly spurring commercial activity through public expenditure but also by investing in education and social security to keep America’s workforce competitive.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-big-push/article37276878.ece
01 November 2021||November 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Stolen idol sold in the U.S.||Madras, Oct. 31: The Tamil Nadu Police to-night claimed to have unearthed a gang of racketeers who had managed to smuggle out a 1,200-year-old Nataraja idol from an ancient temple in Sivapuram (ten km. from Kumbakonam) to New York. The 1.4 metre idol of the early Chola period has been sold to an art lover in New York for a sum of $one million (Rs. 75 lakhs), police said. Facts came to light when police arrested on Thursday Thilagar of Kuttalam (Thanjavur district) who narrated the startling story of how the idol made its way from Kumbakonam to Madras, then to Bombay and finally to New York, passing innumerable hands. The Nataraja idol, police said, was among the six other idols recovered when some local people unearthed them in a place, six miles from Kumbakonam in 1952. The other idols were Sivakamasundari, Somaskandar, Vinayagar Tirugnana Sambandar and another Amman. The temple trustees at Sivapuram to whom the idols were handed over, finding them mutilated and tarnished, got them back after being polished by some famous sthapathis. Police said that moulds of Nataraja and Somaskanda idols were taken subsequently by some men who had links with Bombay racketeers in idol smuggling and fakes were cast from the idols.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/stolen-idol-sold-in-the-us/article37276887.ece
01 November 2021||November 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Gold, silver regain sheen||After a sharp fall in September, precious metals regained a bit of their lost sheen in October. The weakness in the U.S. dollar along with concerns pertaining to rising inflation played a key role in helping precious metals close on a positive note at the end of October. Comex gold gained 1.5% to settle at $1,783.9 an ounce at the end of October. Comex silver, too, closed on a strong note. The white metal gained 8.6% to close at $23.95 an ounce. In the domestic market, MCX gold futures gained 2.4% to close at Rs. 47,635 per 10 gm. MCX silver futures closed on a firm note, gaining 8.3% to settle at Rs. 64,534 a kg. After the sharp fall September, Comex gold price recovered marginally in October. This, however, has not altered the overall weak outlook for the yellow metal. Unless the price moves above $1,840, there is a possibility of Comex gold sliding to the $1,660-1,670 range. A fall below $1,750 would strengthen the case for a slide to the $1,660-1,670 range. In essence, either a move above $1,840 or a fall below $1,750 would set the tone for the next move in Comex gold. As anticipated last month, there was a recovery in the price of Comex silver. The recovery however did not help the price cross the key resistance level at $25. A move past $25 would be a sign of strength and could help the white metal move to the next target of $26.75-27.50. A fall below $22.8 would be a sign of weakness and could push the silver price to lower levels of $20.5-21. The short-term trend in Comex silver hinges on the breakout above $25 or a fall below $22.90. The short-term outlook for MCX gold is positive and the price could head to the immediate target of Rs. 50,500-51,000. A move past Rs. 48,300 would confirm the positive outlook. This would be under threat if the price slides below Rs. 46,200. As long as this level is not breached, there would be a strong case for a rise to Rs. 50,500. Short-term outlook for MCX silver is positive and this would be confirmed on a move past Rs. 67,000. A move above this level could help MCX silver head towards the next target of Rs. 70,000-Rs. 70,500. The positive outlook would be under threat on a close below Rs. 61,500 To summarise, the short-term outlook for precious metals is sort of mixed. A move past the levels mentioned above would influence the next major directional move in gold and silver. In the domestic market, there appears to be a case for a short-term rise in precious metals.  (The author is a Chennai-based analyst / trader.

01 November 2021||November 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Ask Us||Several readers seek to understand avenues for investments early in their careers. Please refer https://bit.ly/InvestmentBeginner or scan the QR code accompanying this article. Q.I am 27 and I work in an MNC. I earn Rs. 42,000 a month. Both my parents are retired and dependent on my income. I spend about Rs. 10,000-Rs. 15,000 a month. I have previously tried saving via FDs and RDs. Could you suggest an investment avenue that can earn returns such that my parents get a monthly income of Rs. 10,000-Rs. 15,000? Aishwarya Kumar A.It will take a few years to build a corpus that is large enough to yield a monthly income of Rs. 15,000 for your parents. Two safe options to consider for setting up the pension are the Post Office Senior Citizens Savings Scheme (SCSS) and LIC’s Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana. In the latter, you can deposit up to Rs. 15 lakh in the name of each of your parents, if they are above 60, to yield a return of 7.4% per annum. Currently, if you deposit Rs. 15 lakh, your parents will get a monthly pension of Rs. 9,250 from this scheme for 10 years. The SCSS, also available to seniors, offers 7.4% for 5 years, a tenure that can be extended. This scheme requires you to open an SCSS account under your parent’s name with an authorised bank or post office, which then credits quarterly interest into their savings accounts. Both these options score high on safety on account of central government backing. You can start making deposits in these avenues so that the pension amount eventually reaches your target. Besides, you can consider debt mutual funds that invest in highly-rated instruments. Presently short-duration debt funds, floating-rate debt funds and funds that invest in PSU bonds and State Development Loans are good options that can earn you a market-linked return. You can either park a lump sum in such funds or invest regularly through systematic investment plans in their growth plans to accumulate a sufficient corpus. At the end of 3 years (for tax efficiency) you can set up a Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) from these funds that can double up as regular income for your parents. Assuming an annual return of about 6.5%, an investment of about Rs. 20.5 lakh will be needed to set up a Rs. 15,000 per month SWP for 20 years. Q.I am a director at an NBFC. I am 64. Three years ago, I bought a flat on a home loan of Rs. 25 lakh and am paying EMI of about Rs. 20,000. My salary is Rs. 40,000 and I don’t have other planned investments. At this age, I am spending half of my earning on EMI. Given my pay levels, the income tax benefits I get on interest are limited. Is it advisable to quickly prepay the home loan or to invest in some other avenue? Vijayakumar K A.Though the effective interest rate on a home loan may be quite low if you took it in recent years, it appears prudent in your case to quickly prepay the home loan if you have a surplus, before stepping up investments. Many folks make the argument that as long as your investments can earn higher returns than the interest cost (after tax breaks) that you incur on a home loan, it makes sense to invest your surpluses instead of prepaying the loan. However, there are qualitative considerations that lead us to recommend prepaying the loan. One, given your age (64) it may be difficult to predict how long you may like to sustain your current career or work profile in future. Health conditions cropping up for yourself or family members, may, for instance, intervene to require you to scale down your work commitments. Having a fixed EMI hanging over your head for the next 10-15 years would rob you of the flexibility to take such decisions, as you may be forced to keep up your income levels to meet the loan repayment obligation. Two, while the interest you incur on your home loan is a certain outgo, there’s a lot of uncertainty attached to the returns you may end up earning on investments you make now, especially if you choose to make investments in mutual funds or other market-linked avenues. Prepaying a home loan would yield you definite savings of Rs. 20,000 a month. Three, prepaying the home loan and clearing the mortgage would enhance your family’s security and endow you with more peace of mind. It may also be prudent to take a term-life policy for the outstanding loan amount, if you are unable to prepay it in full. Q.I am a 30-year-old State government employee. I earn Rs. 5 lakh a year. Kindly suggest the best investment avenues for getting good returns. Vamshi Reddy A.You must already be contributing to a PF account through your employer. Before adding on other investments, it would be good to buy a term life insurance policy if you have dependents, and health insurance to cover you against sudden medical expenses in case you switch jobs. It is also essential to have an emergency fund of up to 12 months’ expenses parked in an FD or other safe avenues. Both the Public Provident Fund and SIPs in equity funds are good options for starting investments. However, before initiating such investments, it would help to map out your financial goals and the time horizons in which you would like to achieve them.

01 November 2021||DUBAI,||Indian batters fail to fire again, surrender meekly to New Zealand||India went from bad to worse as another insipid batting display saw it suffer a humiliating defeat against New Zealand in its ICC T20 World Cup match at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday. After the Men in Blue finished with a sub-par total — 110 for seven — the Black Caps eased to an eight-wicket win with 33 balls to spare. The second loss in as many games, after the 10-wicket mauling by Pakistan the previous Sunday, put the team’s chances of making it to the semifinal in jeopardy. Accurate While the Kiwi bowlers were extremely accurate, the Indian batters were all at sea, both against the three-pronged pace attack of Trent Boult, Tim Southee and Adam Milne and the spin duo of left-armer Mitchell Santner and leggie Ish Sodhi, celebrating his 29th birthday. Even after tweaking the batting order — Ishan Kishan, who replaced the injured Suryakumar Yadav (back spasm), opened with K.L. Rahul — which pushed Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli to No. 3 and 4, India couldn’t get going after being asked to bat. Failing to pierce the gaps, the top-order batters attempted to clear the ropes and found the fielders in the deep almost every time. Power(less)play  It was 35 for two in the PowerPlay and the nine-over passage in the middle saw the team add just 38 for the loss of three wickets. That the Indians couldn’t score a boundary for 71 balls — from the sixth over till the 17th — reflected the dominance of the Kiwi bowlers. Kohli’s men reached the three-figure mark, thanks to Ravindra Jadeja’s cameo. New Zealand and opener Daryl Mitchell, sensing the opportunity to improve the Net Run Rate, went after the Indian bowlers. Mitchell’s aggressive knock and some strange captaincy by Kohli — there was no effort to pressurise the batters into making mistakes — meant that the chasing team was in cruise control. While Jasprit Bumrah was the lone wicket-taker, picking up both scalps, Hardik Pandya bowled a couple of overs. Kane Williamson and Devon Conway steered the Kiwis home, the captain’s nudge to square-leg off Shardul Thakur, who replaced Bhuvneshwar Kumar, ending India’s agony.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/indian-batters-fail-to-fire-again-surrender-tamely-to-new-zealand/article37276975.ece
01 November 2021||Fujairah (UAE),||India pips Kyrgyz Republic in shootout, finishes second||Indian football team secured its best ever finish in the AFC U-23 Asian Cup Qualifiers by claiming the second spot in Group- E as goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh made some spectacular saves to help the side win the shootout against Kyrgyz Republic 4-2 after regulation time ended goalless here. With the match ending in a stalemate, both sides finished the group on four points apiece with the same goal difference (zero) and equal number of goals scored in all the matches (2). To decide who takes the second and third spots, a penalty shootout was held, which India won 4-2. Earlier, UAE beat Oman 2-0 to end as the topper of Group E. Top teams from each Group qualify directly for next year’s continental showpiece along with the best four second-placed teams across all Groups. India now needs to wait till the conclusion of other Group matches to know if it can qualify for its maiden AFC U-23 Asian Cup. Earlier in the match, Apuia tried to hurl the first attack in as early as the fifth minute but his long-ranger could not pose any threat to the Kyrgyz defence. Two minutes later, Rahul, from the left flank, outran Kumarbai Uulu with sheer pace, but eventually Adilet Kanybekov neutralised his effort. The central Asian outfit sprung into life three minutes later when forward Alygulov Maksat was denied by Narender inside the 18-yard-box, five minutes later, the youngster cancelled Tapaev Temirbolot’s right-footed curler. Rahim shielded off Artiukov Daniil before rolling it to an onrushing Vikram whose left-footed effort flew away from the target in the 21st minute. The forward played another pivotal role a minute later as he passed the ball to Amarjit, but the Manipuri midfielder skied his effort after four minutes. Borubaev Gulzhigit beat the offside trap to outpace Asish Rai from the left, but Dheeraj came up with a spectacular save after the half-hour mark to keep the score unscathed. Kyrgyz Republic resumed with more intent and came close to breaking the deadlock in the 50th minute but Maksat skied his effort. India’s best possible chance seven minutes later when Deepak Tangri put an acrobatic bicycle kick from handshaking distance, only to be thwarted by Kyrgyz goalkeeper Tokotaev Erzhan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-pips-kyrgyz-republic-in-shootout-finishes-second/article37277219.ece
01 November 2021||Chennai,||CSK salutes Neeraj’s gold-medal feat||The passion, the perfection, and the quest. Then the throw of fire, fury and history. Gunning for the yellow metal, Neeraj Chopra, running with rhythm and speed and hurling the javelin with power and effort, struck gold on the biggest stage of them all — the Tokyo Olympics. His spectacular feat struck a chord with Chennai Super Kings (CSK), an immensely successful and popular cricketing franchise. In recognition of Neeraj’s incredible feat of becoming the first Indian to win a track and field medal at the Olympics — that too a gold — CSK presented Neeraj with Rs. 1 crore and immortalised 8758 [Neeraj’s gold winning throw was 87.58m] by handing him a jersey with the magical number inscribed on it in New Delhi on Sunday. Talking to The Hindu , CSK CEO K.S. Viswanathan said, “India Cements has always been a sports loving company. And N. Srinivasan loves all sports, was a good tennis player himself in his younger days.” Viswanathan added, “India Cements has sponsored many sports such as tennis, ball badminton, badminton, and hockey in the past.” A benchmark He said, “Neeraj’s achievement was phenomenal, a benchmark. He is an inspiration for the nation. It was natural that India Cements would recognise it and the number associated with the feat.” Neeraj said, “Thank you so much for your support and the prize. “The last two months have been hectic. I never thought I would get so much love after winning the gold medal.” Gold glitters. So does Neeraj Chopra. And CSK acknowledged the epic achievement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/csk-salutes-neerajs-gold-medal-feat/article37277216.ece
01 November 2021||Abu Dhabi,||Afghanistan gives Asghar Afghan a perfect send-off||Pacers Hamid Hassan and Naveen-ul-Haq shared six wickets between them in impressive bowling spells as Afghanistan crushed Namibia by 62 runs in their Super 12 match of the T20 World Cup here on Sunday. Opting to bat, Afghanistan posted 160 for five, thanks to handy contributions from Hazratullah Zazai (33), Mohammad Shahzad (45), Asghar Afghan (31) — who was playing his last international match — and Mohammad Nabi (32 not out). The Afghans then restricted Namibia to 98 for nine for their second win in the tournament. Chasing 161, Namibia lost three wickets inside the PowerPlay and could never recover from there. Naveen-ul-Haq (3/26) removed Craig Williams (1) and Michael van Lingen (11) early in a spell of 2/2 and then added another wicket later on. Hassan (3/9) tormented the Namibia middle-order, picking up the wickets of captain Gerhard Erasmus (12), top-scorer David Wiese (26) and J.J. Smit (0). Gulbadin Naib (2/19) chipped in with the wicket of Jan Loftie-Eaton (11). Earlier, Afghan played a nice cameo to score 31 off 23 balls in his farewell game, which helped Afghanistan post 160 for five. In his last game for the country, he provided good support to current captain Nabi (32 not out off 17 balls) and the duo’s 35-run stand took the team's total past 150-run mark.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/hassan-and-naveen-bowl-afghanistan-to-big-win/article37276966.ece

01 November 2021||Abu Dhabi,||‘Loss against Pakistan forced me to retire’||A teary-eyed Asghar Afghan said his decision to retire in the middle of the ongoing T20 World Cup was triggered by the pain that he and his teammates endured after Afghanistan’s heart-breaking loss to Pakistan in its previous match. “In the last match, we were hurt too much, and that’s why I decided to retire,” Asghar, who has led Afghanistan in 115 matches, said wiping his tears during a chat after the end of the first innings. “There are plenty of memories, it’s difficult for me, but I have to retire.” The 33-year-old played six Tests, 114 ODIs and 75 T20Is, including the Namibia match, in a creditable career, scoring 4246 runs across formats. Chance for youngsters “I want to give chance to youngsters. I think this is a good opportunity for that. Most people are asking me why now but it’s something I cannot explain,” said Afghan. Afghanistan will next play India on November 3.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/loss-against-pakistan-forced-me-to-retire/article37276968.ece
01 November 2021||London,||Leeds moves out of relegation zone||Leeds recorded just its second Premier League victory of the season on Sunday, beating Norwich 2-1 to climb out of the relegation zone. Marcelo Bielsa's men finished an impressive ninth last season on their return to the English top-flight but have struggled in the early weeks of the current season. The sides were locked at 0-0 at Carrow Road at half-time but the game exploded into life in a dramatic four-minute spell after the break. Leeds broke the deadlock in the 56th minute when Brazilian forward Raphinha rifled into the bottom corner after a pass from Daniel James. Bottom-side Norwich trailed for just two minutes, with defender Andrew Omobamidele heading home the equaliser from Milot Rashica's corner to the delight of the home fans. Cheers to despair But their cheers turned to despair just two minutes later when the visitors retook the lead. England midfielder Kalvin Phillips found Rodrigo, who was given too much space and let fly from distance, with his low left-footed effort finding its way underneath Tim Krul. The win lifts Leeds to 17th in the table, three points clear of the bottom three but Norwich remains winless and is now eight points from safety. In Milan, Joaquín Correa scored twice as Inter Milan beat Udinese 2-0 on Sunday to keep up the pressure on the top two in Serie A. Both Correa’s goals came in the second half, within eight minutes of each other, as Inter moved to within four points of Milan and Napoli.  The results:   Premier League: Leeds United 2 (Raphinha 56, Rodrigo 60) bt Norwich City 1 (Omobamidele).   Bundesliga: Augsburg 4 (Oxford 30, Gouweleeuw 53, Niederlechner 72, Finnbogason 81) bt VfB Stuttgart 1 (Fuehrlich 7).

01 November 2021||Sharjah,||England eyes semifinal spot||A rampaging England is expected to brush aside a struggling Sri Lanka and seal a spot in the semifinals when the two teams meet here on Monday. England has played as per expectations, riding roughshod on opponents, including Australia on Saturday. Jos Buttler was simply unstoppable against Australia and that is another big positive for England. The middle-order batters have not been tested so far, but Eoin Morgan is confident they will deliver when the time comes. Pacer Chris Woakes was brilliant with the new ball and so were Chris Jordan and Adil Rashid. Part-time spinner Liam Livingstone too has done a good job, providing Morgan another option. Sri Lanka will have to produce something special to halt England. Sri Lanka has not played too badly, and the final-over finish against South Africa could have gone either way. Unfortunately, it was its second loss and hence must win against England to stay alive. Charith Asalanka has been in great form and opener Pathum Nissanka did well against the South Africans. If the batters do better, the bowlers showed on Saturday they are capable of defending decent totals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/england-eyes-semifinal-spot/article37277127.ece

01 November 2021||DUBAI,||‘Tried to give ourselves some cushion’||Jasprit Bumrah tried his best to defend a lacklustre display by the Indian batters in the Super 12 game against New Zealand on Sunday. “As a batting unit, we tried to give ourselves some cushion as we knew that the dew would be a massive factor and batting would be easier in the second innings. We wanted to get extra runs as it would give us the advantage. That’s why we played a lot of attacking shots but they didn’t come off today,” said Bumrah. With the next match, against Afghanistan, just three nights away, Bumrah conceded that the players needed to be at their best. “As a sportsman, you face these things. Some days will be good and some bad. What I try to do is not get very high when good days happen and not very low when low days happen,” Bumrah said. “Try to stay in the moment, analyse what went wrong and what went well, and try to move forward... that’s the only way,” added the speedster. Ish Sodhi, one of the architects of New Zealand’s win, admitted that he couldn’t have celebrated his 29th birthday better. “A cool way to spend your birthday. You spend so much time away from friends and family most of the year. So I guess to have a day like that and beat a top- quality side like India is pretty cool,” Sodhi said.

01 November 2021||MUMBAI,||IPL: BCCI keeps Rs. 90 crore as salary cap||The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has informed the franchises that a salary cap of Rs. 90 crore has been set for the teams for the next season. In an email to the franchises, the BCCI has specified that the existing eight teams will be allowed to retain a maximum of four players. The new entrants — Ahmedabad and Lucknow — can choose three players from the pool after the existing eight teams pick their retention. As per the email, if a team retains four players, a total of Rs. 42 crore will be deducted from their purse, while a three-player retention would lead to a deduction of Rs. 33 crore. “For two retentions, it will be Rs. 24 crore. In case a team retains only one player, it will lose Rs. 14 crore from its purse,” one of the BCCI sources confirmed. If any franchise wants to retain uncapped players, it will cost Rs. 4 crore. In case of four retentions, it could be either three Indians (capped or uncapped) and one foreign player or two Indians and as many foreigners as the maximum. For Lucknow and Ahmedabad, they will have the right to pick two Indians and one foreign player from the available pool. In case of uncapped players, the old franchises will get two picks and new teams will have one choice. They will have a Rs. 33 crore purse to pick three players who go back to the pool before the auction. While the existing teams will get a chance to use their retention throughout November, Ahmedabad and Lucknow need to pick their players between December 1-25. The mega auction is set to be held in January.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ipl-bcci-keeps-rs-90-crore-as-salary-cap/article37277229.ece

01 November 2021||November 01 2021 00:00 IST,||The nose knows||“Indians, as a populace, are a smelly lot.” No, I didn’t say that; an international stand-up comic did. Yes, it’s a generalisation, one I’d like to vehemently refute (unless when I am queuing for a 6 a.m. boarding and oddly find proof to the contrary). But body odour isn’t the real problem — it’s a hot tropical country, we all sweat, it’s only normal. The trouble is that most of us either remain ignorant of our own bodily olfactory prowess or else are too blasé to do anything about it. For a country rich in spices, in perfumed plant extracts, it almost seems paradoxical. Thankfully, the new India that is emerging all around us now is more cautious of this malaise. To borrow a phrase from Abdullah Ajmal, scion of the Ajmal perfume empire, “Look good, feel good, and smell good” — Indians are realising how achieving two out three on that scale ain’t good enough.  Scent s for all  Perfumes, an essential as they may sound now, were always pitched as a luxury. This didn’t make them a daily decision, but a pricey periodic indulgence. And even for those who could afford them, the selection and availability remained locally limited. Duty-free or travel abroad purchases account for a major chunk of my own collection. What we got on Indian shelves were chemical-heavy, heady fumes bottled up with names that resembled more popular international brands. Now we did have some serious perfumes, but they sat at the other end — great olfactory libraries in the by-lanes of our cities, which had been forgotten by time, where the attar -makers operated. These oils and extracts were extremely precious and rare, but their applicability, as also handling, was too cumbersome for the city slicker types. Thankfully, and now I am finally getting to the point, there is a new range of perfumes emerging, homegrown brands working with international ‘noses’, churning out scents that could go nose-to-nose with established brands. They use quality raw materials (pure or natural identical), package it smartly, and price it within the reach of the larger set. Here is a quick set of perfumes which are making the olfactory waves. Incidentally, Oudh seems to be a common thread, perhaps why the cultivation of this endangered tree species is gaining popularity in Kerala.  Ajmal: “Oudh hasn’t seen the light of day yet!” These words from my meeting with Abdullah Ajmal stay with me. We are, pun intended, yet to scratch the surface with this bark and the possibilities are truly endless. It isn’t always heady and dominating; they showed me a blend with florals and citrus top-notes where the Oudh sat quietly in the back, supporting the mix but never monopolising it. Another tip from the perfume masters: “There is no way for the common consumer to tell if it is pure Oudh or a synthetic concoction; the only way to be sure is to trust the brand you buy from. Engage with them, ask questions, and that is the only way to ensure quality.” Their new range is priced sub-Rs. 2,000 and still boasts the purity of its ingredients.     Bombay Perfumery: From source to spritz — buying ethically from the right farms and producers, blending in local ingredients, and bottling up nuances and nostalgia — the outfit by Manan Gandhi has a lot of it on point. Add to this their collabs and candles — including one starring oudh (Rs. 1,600) — and they have a complete solution to making sure that you and your environs send all the right notes wafting. Approximately Rs. 4,000.     Maison de F o uzdar: Dimple Fouzdar, the founder, is another strong supporter of all things Oudh, but understands the need to give it a contemporary update. Their range varies from floral to woody-spicy and all in between, and is positioned as a premium top-shelf product. A 100 ml flacon is in the Rs. 4,000 range.     Olfa Originals: Focussed on all things Oudh, these premium-priced perfumes are yet another in the mix; I especially enjoyed their roll-on versions, which were easy to carry and extremely long lasting. Rs. 5,000 and upwards.     Embark: A very affordable range (sub Rs. 2,500 for 100 ml Eau de Parfum) and packed like 80s classic perfumes, they feel reassuringly rich and are decently lasting. The ‘Rajasthan’, ‘Kerala’ and ‘Goa’ variants managed to capture the essence of the respective places quite well. To me, a good perfume is all about how it makes you feel and how long they last. Preferences for notes and blends remain a personal affair, but my experiments with these brands have all been quite positive — we can finally talk about scents made to exacting standards and yet within everyone’s reach. Aristocracy all along had made us stink, democracy is what will make India (and Indians) blossom! Here’s to stink-free 6 a.m. flights.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/the-nose-knows/article37277515.ece
01 November 2021||Chandigarh,||Sunil Jakhar takes a jibe at Punjab Govt.||Senior Congress leader Sunil Jakhar on Sunday took a dig at Charanjit Singh Channi-led government in Punjab for allegedly failing to issue newspaper advertisements to remember Indira Gandhi on her death anniversary. In a tweet, Mr. Jakhar tagged a Punjab government advertisement issued last year under the Amarinder Singh-led Congress government to commemorate the former Prime Minister. “I can understand BJP trying to erase ‘Iron Lady of India’ from history but don’t we still have a Congress Government in Punjab,” Mr. Jakhar tweeted. In another tweet, he made a veiled allusion to the appointment of Jagdish Tytler as a permanent invitee to the Delhi Congress’ new executive committee and wondered if government’s not issuing an ad to remember Indira had anything to do with it. “Or is it a case of ‘once burned twice shy’ — in light of certain appointment two days ago?” Mr. Jakhar posted. Mr. Tytler was one of the main accused in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in Delhi. “PS. I know Capt Saab (Amarinder) won’t mind my using this PB Govt’s ad from last year, as none appeared today,” he added in another tweet. Indira Gandhi was assassinated on this day in 1984 by two of her own security guards.  Opposition targets Govt. Opposition parties including the BJP and the SAD in Punjab have targeted the Punjab government over Mr. Tytler’s appointment. BJP leader Tarun Chugh on Saturday asked Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi and Congress’ State unit chief Navjot Singh Sidhu to clarify if they endorsed Mr. Tytler’s appointment as a permanent invitee to the committee. “Tytler has been named as one of the key Congress leaders in Delhi, but he, Kamal Nath and Sajjan Kumar continue to be the blue-eyed boys of the party in spite of the fact that their role in riots against Sikhs has been always highlighted by many witnesses,” Mr. Chugh said. SAD leader Daljit Singh Cheema asked Mr. Channi to tell Punjabis why he gave his “consent” for the appointment of Mr. Tytler to a “prestigious”Congress panel. Three days back also, Mr. Jakhar had made a cryptic comment when Mr. Channi was on a visit to Delhi and AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal visited Punjab on the same day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/sunil-jakhar-takes-a-jibe-at-punjab-govt/article37277521.ece
