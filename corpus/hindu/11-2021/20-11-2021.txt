20 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. relents, decides to spike farm laws||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday announced the repeal of the three contentious farm laws, assuring farmer groups protesting against them for the past year that the legislative process for the withdrawal would be completed in the coming winter session of Parliament. In a television broadcast to the nation, Mr. Modi also announced the formation of a committee with representatives from both the Central and State Governments to look into issues related to agriculture, such as zero-budget farming, fertilizers, change in crop patterns, transparency in establishing minimum support prices and so on. The Government’s intentions in bringing in these laws was to provide alternatives to small farmers, who constituted 80% of farmers in the country, for access to markets and good prices for their crops, he stated. “I apologise to you, my countrymen, that despite my Government’s good intentions, there may have been something lacking in our tapasya [penance] that we could not convince some of our farmer brothers of the intentions of these laws which were as pure as the light from a lamp,” he said. Organised dialogue “Earlier Governments too had considered such measures and we consulted a range of stakeholders and experts before bringing in these laws. Many farmers were happy with the reforms and we are grateful to them. We could not explain to some farmers despite our efforts. Agricultural economists, scientists and progressive farmers also tried their best to make them understand the importance of agricultural laws,” he noted. “Even though this section was not a huge part of the larger category of farmers, it was important for us that we convince them. We tried engaging them in dialogue, we listened to their arguments and the logic that they put forward, we agreed to suspend the implementation of these laws for two years, and the matter has also been put before the Supreme Court. Particular sections of the laws that they objected to were also removed, but may be there was something lacking somewhere that we were not able to convince this section of farmers,” he observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-relents-decides-to-spike-farm-laws/article37591090.ece
20 November 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Post NEP, Odisha all set to teach in tribal languages||The new National Education Policy lays emphasis on imparting teaching in mother tongue in primary classes. But when the language base of Odisha’s adivasi communities is as diverse as 21 spoken languages further divided into 74 dialects, the task appears to be quite onerous. However, Odisha’s decade-long experience in multi-lingual education may come in handy to take up the challenge. The ST and SC Development Department of the State Government has already started working on project called ‘Samhati’ to address the language issues faced by tribal students in early grades or elementary classes. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Research and Training Institute (SCSTRTI) along with the Academy of Tribal Language and Culture (ATLC), Bhubaneswar are implementing the project. As many as 3,328 teachers and 222 language teachers are in place to impart teaching in tribal languages. The department manages 1,732 residential educational institutions across the State. More than 4.5 lakh tribal and Scheduled Caste students from primary to secondary level with free lodging, and 85 boarding facilities are under its care. Now under, Samhati, the department plans to cover approximately 2.5 lakh students in 1,450 primary schools. In addition, the School and Mass Education department also manages about 1,500 schools in 17 tribal dominated districts where students are taught in tribal languages. Of the 21 languages, Santhali — the only language which has been included in eighth schedule of Constitution — is taught in its own ol chiki script while rest of tribal languages have Odia scripts. According to the Odisha School Education Programme Authority, more than 302 textbooks and 2,500 supplementary reading materials in 21 tribal languages have been developed. Although it is easy to prescribe mother tongue as medium of instruction up to Class V, it is very difficult to implement. Odisha is home to 62 different tribal communities, making it the State with the most diverse indigenous communities in the country. “Since the ST and SC department runs residential schools, it enrols students from all tribal communities. These students are multi-lingual group,” said a researcher. Under Samhati it has been decided that all teachers of primary level would be provided functional knowledge of tribal languages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/with-nep-mandate-odisha-bats-for-mother-tongue-of-tribals/article37591079.ece
20 November 2021||Ghaziabad,||Farmers hail ‘historic victory’||The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a platform of protesting farmer unions, has welcomed the repeal of the three laws as a “historic victory” but noted that its struggle included other demands regarding remunerative prices and electricity rates. It has not yet taken a decision on whether or when to withdraw its stir. In an initial statement, the SKM said it would wait for the declaration to take effect through parliamentary procedures. “If this happens, it will be a historic victory of the year-long farmers’ struggle in India,” it noted. “However, nearly 700 farmers have been martyred in this struggle. The Government’s obstinacy is responsible for these avoidable deaths, including the murders at Lakhimpur Kheri,” it stated. “SKM will take note of all developments, hold its meeting soon and announce further,” it added. It said that they had also called for a statutory legal guarantee that all farmers will receive Minimum Support Prices for their produce and withdrawal of the Electricity Amendment Bill. Describing the repeal of farm laws as just “one step” towards resolving farmers’ demands, the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) said that they would decide on the future course of the agitation only after the SKM meeting on Saturday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/farmers-hail-historic-victory-but-wont-wind-up-strike-now/article37591088.ece
20 November 2021||Mangaluru,||SCDCC Bank chairman can be removed for ‘funds misuse’: Minister||Days after South Canara District Central Cooperative (SCDCC) Bank chairman M.N. Rajendra Kumar, who had declared his intent to contest as an Independent candidate in the Legislative Council polls met KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar, Cooperation Minister S.T. Somashekar on Friday said the department can dismiss the chairman for alleged misuse of funds. Speaking at the Jan Swaraj Yatra organised by the Bharatiya Janata Party in Udupi and Mangaluru, Mr. Somashekar said Rs. 19 lakh was being transferred every year from the SCDCC Bank to Navodaya Grama Vikasa Charitable Trust, of which Mr. Kumar was the managing trustee. The Registrar of Cooperative Societies has the power to disqualify him from being a member of the board under Section 29C of the Karnataka Cooperative Societies Act, he said. The Minister said that the department has already served a notice in this regard to Mr. Kumar. Stating that no one heeded his request to give representation to the cooperative sector in the Council, Mr. Kumar decided to contest the polls scheduled for December 10 from Dakshina Kannada-Udupi Local Authorities’ constituency that has two seats. He opened a campaign office in Mangaluru on Tuesday and met Mr. Shivakumar in Bengaluru on Wednesday. It was said the Congress was wary of his candidature as Mr. Kumar could defeat the party’s official candidate and hence attempted to win him over to the party. While Mr. Kumar had earlier identified himself with the Congress, of late he came closer to BJP leaders too. BJP that was confident of winning one seat from where Minister Kota Srinivas Poojary might be fielded again, intended to transfer surplus votes to Mr. Kumar if he contested as an Independent. Mr. Kumar told The Hindu he does not want to criticise anyone. “Everything was being done as per law [in the bank],” he said. Admitting that his meeting with Mr. Shivakumar might have provoked the Minister, Mr. Kumar said he would decide [contesting on Congress ticket] on Saturday. His [Mr. Somashekar’s] own special officer Dinesh Gooligouda was being fielded as a Congress candidate [from Mandya], Mr. Kumar noted adding he did not seek an audience with Mr. Shivakumar. A true cooperative does not identify himself or herself with any cooperative party, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/scdcc-bank-chairman-can-be-removed-for-funds-misuse-minister/article37591543.ece
20 November 2021||HUBBALLI,||167% excess rainfall in Dharwad district||Intermittent rains continued to lash Dharwad district for the fourth day causing further anxiety among the farmers, who have already suffered crop loss in some taluks. Meanwhile, house collapses have also been reported in the district. Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad Nitesh Patil has said that the district had received the maximum rainfall in the last three days and steps had been taken to initiate relief works.

Kalghatgi has received 80 mm rainfall, which is 202% more. These are the three taluks in the district which have recorded the maximum rainfall. This widespread rain has caused crop damage and also partial damage to properties,” he said. According to reports received so far, 188 houses have partially collapsed in the district and 22 have totally collapsed. Standing agriculture crops on 7,390 hectares have been totally destroyed and horticulture crops in 1,210 hectares are damaged.

20 November 2021||belagavi,||Farmers’ associations welcome decision||Farmers’ associations have welcomed the Union Government’s announcement of its intent to repeal the farm laws, but with a few riders. Most leaders want the Centre to actually repeal the laws before they can fully celebrate. They also want Karnataka to withdraw its farm laws. “I will be happy the day the laws are actually repealed in Parliament,” said Sidagouda Modagi, Krishik Samaj leader. He pointed out that Karnataka had passed similar laws, including amending the land reforms Act that enabled corporations and rich individuals to buy huge tracts of land. “All these have to be repealed, if the situation has to return to normal,” he said. Jayashree Gurannanavar, Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha and Dalit Sangharsha Samiti leader, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should have made the announcement after repealing the laws. “If the Centre can bring in ordinances to introduce several laws, why can it not repeal the laws using ordinances?,” she wondered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/farmers-associations-welcome-decision/article37591342.ece
20 November 2021||MYSURU,||The voice of the people has prevailed: KRRS||Farmers in the state have welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to withdraw the three contentious farm laws and have described it as a victory of the non-violent struggle of the farming community. Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) leader Badgalpura Nagendra said the development is a proof that the government of the day has to bow and listen to the voice of the people.  Terming it as historic, the KRRS leader said despite differences of views on various issues, the country was one and united against the farm laws forcing the government to repeal it. The farmers braved the scorching heat, biting cold and rain, but did not relent and the struggle continued for a year forcing the government to withdraw the laws, said Mr. Nagendra. Kurubur Shanthakumar, president, Karnataka State Sugarcane Cultivators Association, said the decision to withdraw the laws should serve as a warning bell to the government and the political parties that they cannot take the farmers for granted. “There were concerted efforts to break the struggle and suppress the voice of the farmers but it did not succeed,” said Mr. Shanthakumar. Though belated, the decision to repeal the laws is welcome and has demonstrated what changes farmers’ unity can bring about, according to Mr. Shanthakumar. The government tried to mislead the country stating that those protesting were not farmers but commission agents, brokers and “urban naxals”, he added. There are speculations that the move to repeal the law was political in view of the coming Uttar Pradesh elections and hence, the farmers will continue to be vigil, said Mr. Nagendra and Mr. Shanthakumar. They said that the government should also concede their demand for a law ensuring statutory guarantee of Minimum Support Price for agricultural produce. But the two leaders regretted that 671 farmer had died during the course of the struggle since a year and said they remember their sacrifice in this moment of victory. The sugarcane cultivators association also sought compensation and relief to the tune of Rs. 25 lakh for the surviving family members of each of the deceased farmers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/the-voice-of-the-people-has-prevailed-krrs/article37591545.ece
20 November 2021||MYSURU,||Rain: Another building collapses in Mysuru||Another building in Mysuru collapsed early on Friday as rains continued to wreak havoc in the city. With no let-up in rains, dilapidated buildings have started to crumble, threatening the safety of occupants. The house where one Madhava Rao was living with his family on K.R. Street in Mandi Mohalla came crashing down amidst the downpour. The building’s frontal portion caved in and five members of the Madhava Rao’s family were trapped in another portion of the building. The occupants included a senior citizen and a child. Madhava Rao had taken the building on lease. The family was rescued by personnel of Fire and Emergency Services. The trapped family members were brought to safety in an operation that lasted for over an hour. Personnel from MCC later arrived at the spot and cleared the debris from the spot.This is the third building in run-down condition that collapsed in the last few days. MCC Commissioner Lakshmikanth Reddy told The Hindu that the corporation had completed the survey of dilapidated buildings and notices had been served on owners of structures that were in run-down condition. The zone-wise details on dilapidated buildings and the action planned by MCC in this connection as a safety measure, would be shared on Monday. The MCC, on the lines of measures taken by the BBMP in the State capital, had initiated a survey of old and dilapidated structures in the wake of collapse of several buildings in Bengaluru. With as many as three buildings in decrepit condition collapsing in Mysuru, the corporation’s measures gain importance. Engineers of all nine zones had been told to identify such buildings and submit a report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rain-another-building-collapses-in-mysuru/article37591568.ece
20 November 2021||Thrissur,||Lockdown a blessing in disguise for livestock||The lockdowns following the COVID-19 outbreak have a positive impact on the State’s livestock sector. People, confined to homes, turned to livestock rearing, either as a source of income or as a hobby to engage themselves. Livestock and poultry entrepreneurship has emerged as a potential employment sector in the State. While more than 75% of women are involved in livestock rearing, more than 50% of men are involved in marketing of livestock products. As per the statistics of the Animal Husbandry Department, cases reported in veterinary hospitals have recorded a quantum jump in 2020-21 compared to 2019-20, indicating a substantial increase in livestock rearing. 17% increase “There has been an annual increase of 17% in the number of the cases reported in veterinary hospitals this year compared to 2019-20. In the case of cattle, the increase is 7% whereas it is 21% for small ruminants such as goat. Pet animal cases, especially dogs and cats, show an annual increase of 46% to 103% during this period,” says T.P. Sethumadhavan, former Director, Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (KVASU). This tally may increase further considering the increase in cases at KVASU hospitals and related institutions. The State is witnessing a shortage of veterinarians to treat the increasing livestock. There is also a need for a substantial increase in diagnostic facilities. The department has launched night veterinary services at the block level. Haemoprotozoan diseases are also on the rise as cattle have been brought from neighbouring States, say experts. Milk production The State has shown a quantum jump in milk production during the post COVID period. However, lack of value-addition and cold chain facilities have affected the marketability of products. There is a need to focus on sustainable meat production in order to meet the increasing demand in national and international markets, says B. Sunil, Professor and Head, Meat Technology Unit, KVASU. Disease-free zones “Animal health should be ensured by creating disease-free zones, which in turn will promote export of meat and meat products,” says Dr. Sunil. In dairying, feed accounts for more than 75% of the cost of production, with prices rising steadily in the State. But continuous rain and fodder production programmes have helped the farmers to reduce the cost of production with the use of green fodder. Farmers say that the cost of dairying can be reduced by 40% with the strategic use of green fodder.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/lockdown-a-blessing-in-disguise-for-livestock/article37591419.ece

While stating that Speaker Tammineni Sitaram did not allow him to condemn the comments made against his wife, Mr. Naidu broke down at the press conference. Wiping his tears, the Opposition leader asserted that his wife showed least interest in politics. “She never accompanied me unless requested to follow the protocol. She has no knowledge of who is who in the TDP,” he said. “The Speaker, who should have stopped the comments, did not utter a word. I will leave it to his prudence, and he should introspect,” he said, adding that he would enter the Assembly only as Chief Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/naidu-breaks-down-over-remarks-on-his-wife/article37591085.ece
20 November 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||Will return to Assembly only as CM: Naidu||In a dramatic development in the Legislative Assembly on Friday, Telugu Desam Party national president N. Chandrababu Naidu vowed to come to the House again only as Chief Minister, while staging a walkout in protest against a barrage of personal comments made by YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) MLAs during a discussion on the agriculture sector. Trouble began when the TDP MLAs were making some comments on the Chief Minister and raised the issue of alleged involvement of YSRCP MLA Ambati Rambabu in some cases, when he objected to the levelling of allegations against the Chief Minister. Mr. Rambabu replied that there were criminal cases on the other side too and that Mr. Naidu should be prepared for a discussion on them. Some YSRCP MLAs went to the extent of alleging that Mr. Naidu had a hand in the murder of Vangaveeti Mohan Ranga and Alimineti Madhava Reddy, and made the oft-repeated criticism that he brought his father-in-law N.T. Rama Rao’s downfall. The ruling party MLAs said it was Mr. Naidu who had been making provocative comments about the status of investigation into Y.S. Vivekananda Reddy murder case in the context of a wild allegation that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was behind the crime, and it led to their comments which, they claimed, were not personal. When Mr. Naidu and his party MLAs, and YSRCP MLAs were shouting at each other, Minister Kodali Sri Venkateswara Rao was said to have uttered an unparliamentary word about Mr. Naidu and it led to pandemonium. Speaker Thammineni Seetharam tried in vain to restore order as Ministers Sri Venkateswara Rao and Balineni Srinivasa Reddy, MLA B. Madhusudhan Reddy and others trooped into the well of the House and had angry exchanges with Mr. Naidu and TDP MLAs. ‘Deeply perturbed’ When the Speaker conceded his demand that he be allowed to speak, Mr. Naidu said he was deeply perturbed with the insults heaped on him and alleged that his family was being dragged into the muddle at the behest of the Chief Minister. Mr. Naidu expressed regret that after nearly four decades of his political career, during which he rubbed shoulders with the who's who of national leaders, he had to go through this intense campaign of character assassination. The TDP president then swore that he would not come back to the House till he becomes the Chief Minister, but his words were lost in the din as his mike was cut by then.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/will-return-to-house-only-as-cm/article37591042.ece

In a tweet, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said: “The year-long farmers’ protest has finally triumphed. Indian farmers have scripted one of the brightest chapters in the history of class struggles. Salutes to the martyrs, farmers and organisations who fought with unmatched resoluteness and undying spirit.” Agriculture Minister P. Prasad said the decision to withdraw the farm laws proved that anti-people policies could be corrected by the will of the people. While the rollback was good for the farmers, the BJP-led Government could not dodge responsibility for the loss of nearly 700 lives during the course of the struggle. The country had witnessed a victory of the willpower, sincerity and dedication of the farmers. Their withdrawal had given a boost to similar struggles against anti-people policies, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/one-of-the-brightest-chapters-in-class-struggles-says-cm/article37591420.ece

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray urged the Centre to be careful the next time it planned to enact such legislation and advised it to take other parties into confidence to avoid such “afterthoughts and embarrassment” in future.

20 November 2021||LUCKNOW,||Some use farmers as mere pawns, says Modi||Speaking in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh soon after he announced the withdrawal of the contentious three farm laws, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday launched an attack on Opposition parties and said keeping farmers entangled in problems has been the basis of some parties. “They do politics of problems. We do samadhaan ki rashtra neeti (a national policy for solutions),” Mr. Modi said in Mahoba district of Bundelkhand where he launched developmental projects aimed at alleviating water shortage in the region and to provide relief to farmers. These projects include the Arjun Sahayak Project, the Ratauli Weir Project, the Bhaoni Dam Project and Majhgaon-Chilli Sprinkler Project at a cumulative cost of Rs. 3,250 crore. Their operationalisation will help in the irrigation of around 65,000 hectares of land in the districts of Mahoba, Hamirpur, Banda and Lalitpur, benefiting lakhs of farmers of the region, the PM said. In the 2017 U.P. Assembly election, the BJP clean swept the Bundelkhand region, winning all 19 seats. Mr. Modi said the Governments that ruled in U.P. before the BJP did not leave any stone unturned in destroying Bundelkhand and claimed that they handed over its resources and jungles to the mafia. “When bulldozer is running on these mafia in U.P., some people are raising a cry. No matter how much they cry aloud, the development work of U.P. and Bundelkhand will not stop,” Mr. Modi said. His reference to a “bulldozer” comes from Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s oft-repeated assertions that his Government was running the bulldozer over the property of mafia criminals. Talking about the benefits of the PM-KISAN scheme for farmers, Mr. Modi said that the “ parivarvadiyo ki sarkare ” or Governments run by those into dynasty politics would make several announcements in the name of peasants but the farmers would not get a single penny. In contrast, he said, his Government had directly transferred Rs. 1,62,000 crore into the accounts of farmers.  We have transferred Rs. 1,62,000 crore into the accounts of farmers Narendra Modi Prime Minister||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/some-use-farmers-as-mere-pawns-pm/article37590792.ece
20 November 2021||New Delhi,||Singhu sees celebrations after almost a year of protests||Hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the repeal of the three contentious farm laws on Friday, celebrations broke out among jubilant farmers who have been agitating at the Singhu border for almost a year now. The farmers’ protest will complete a year on November 26. “ Kisan Andolan Zindabad ” slogans were raised with renewed vigour across the protest site by farmers atop tractors blaring Punjabi songs, even as congratulatory messages and greetings kept pouring from visitors and well-wishers throughout the day. The fact that the fruit of their year-long struggle against what they called the “black laws” came on Gurpurab, a day when they celebrate the birth anniversary of the Sikh’s first guru, Guru Nanak, has added to the joy. However, farmers said though the Prime Minister had announced the decision on live television, they were not prepared to trust his word and would continue with their protest till the three laws were repealed by Parliament and they were given a guarantee on a minimum support price (MSP). Muneesh Sehgal, hailing from Kalhana in Punjab, said after holding the agitation for almost a year, during which several of his farmer-brothers had died, he wouldn’t believe any oral declarations until he actually saw them implemented. “It is good news for us, but we are sceptical. We have sacrificed way too much and have been away from our villages back in Punjab…We won’t return so easily to trusting the Prime Minister,” he said. Mr. Sehgal said he had received the good news from his family back home and was elated at first. “It is the auspicious day of Gurpurab for us and we feel vindicated. The news spread like wildfire... But the plan ahead is not to step back, and see the decision actualise,” he added. Sarabjit Singh from Batala in Punjab said even though there was a sense of jubilance, “we won’t carry out the real celebrations”. “Around 700 of our farmer-brothers have lost their lives, their souls will not attain salvation till we actually get the farm laws repealed... We don’t trust the Prime Minister,” Mr. Singh said. Staying on “No one will remove us from here and we are not returning to our village. We are ready to hold our agitation for many years,” he added. “There is undoubtedly a little happiness and all of it has happened due to our struggle and resolve to not step back despite the challenges... Once the laws are repealed by Parliament, only then will we do the bhangra [folk dance] and celebrate our victory… It is better to wait and watch now,” Meje Singh, from Batala, said. Uttam Singh, also from Batala, said: “The fact that the Prime Minister had to announce the repealing on television indicates that the efforts of the elderly and the women protesters have had an impact to shake the Government’s conscience.” He added, “We have disregarded scorching summers and chilly winters in the hope that we will see the black laws being taken back, and today there is a sense of victory.” “But it is only a battle half-won, there is a long way to go,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/singhu-sees-celebrations-after-almost-a-year-of-protests/article37590816.ece
20 November 2021||Singapore,||‘India-China ties seeing a rough patch’||External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said on Friday that India and China were going through a “particularly bad patch” in their ties because Beijing had taken a set of actions in violation of agreements for which it still did not have a “credible explanation”. “I don’t think the Chinese have any doubt on where we stand on our relationship and what’s not gone right with it. I’ve been meeting my counterpart Wang Yi a number of times. As you would’ve experienced, I speak fairly clear, reasonably understandably [and] there is no lack of clarity so if they want to hear it, I am sure they would have heard it,” Mr. Jaishankar said in response to a question at a panel discussion on “Greater Power Competition: The Emerging World Order” at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore. India had told China that progress in the disengagement process in eastern Ladakh was essential for the restoration of peace and tranquillity, he said, stressing that it was the basis for the development of overall bilateral ties. “We are going through a particularly bad patch in our relationship because they have taken a set of actions in violation of agreements for which they still don’t have a credible explanation and that indicates some rethink about where they want to take our relationship, but that’s for them to answer,” he further said, in an apparent reference to the clashes in eastern Ladakh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-china-ties-seeing-a-rough-patch/article37590834.ece
20 November 2021||Pune,||NCRA astronomers discover rare radio stars||In a vital discovery which will aid in the understanding of “exotic” radio stars and stellar magnetospheres, a team of astronomers from the Pune-based National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA-TIFR) have used the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) to discover eight stars belonging to a rare category called ‘Main-sequence Radio Pulse’ emitters or MRPs. Of the total 15 MRPs known so far, 11 have been discovered by the NCRA-TIFR team alone (with three MRPs spotted by them in the recent past) thanks to the wide bandwidth and high sensitivity of the upgraded GMRT, which is a radio telescope located at Khodad in Pune district and which is operated by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in the U.S. The MRPs are stars hotter than the Sun with unusually strong magnetic fields, and are much stronger than stellar winds (a continuous flow of gas from a star’s upper atmosphere). “The success of the GMRT programme has revolutionised our notion about this class of stars. The success of the survey with the uGMRT suggest that the current notion of MRPs as rare objects may not be correct. Rather, they are probably more common but are difficult to detect,” says Barnali Das, a PhD student at the NCRA-TIFR, who has been actively studying this phenomenon. In fact, it was Ms. Das and her supervisor, Prof. Poonam Chandra of the NCRA who first introduced the appellation ‘MRP’ last year in an effort to understand the properties of these stars. The duo has performed the most extensive study of MRPs using two of the world’s leading radio telescopes: the uGMRT and the U.S. based Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). Prof. Chandra says the reason for the difficult detection of MRPs was that the radio pulses are visible only at certain times and the phenomenon is mostly observable at low radio frequencies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ncra-astronomers-discover-rare-radio-stars/article37590826.ece
20 November 2021||Srinagar,||Mehbooba, NC urge PM to revoke 2019 decisions||Peoples Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference (NC) Member of Parliament Hasnain Masoodi on Friday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to revoke all the August 5, 2019 decisions concerning Jammu and Kashmir, like he revoked the farm laws on Friday. Ms. Mufti termed the decision to repeal farm laws and an apology “a welcome step”. She tweeted, “Even though it stems from electoral compulsions and fear of drubbing in elections. Ironical that while BJP needs to please people in rest of India for votes, punishing and humiliating Kashmiris satisfies their major vote bank. Desecrating Indian constitution to dismember and disempower J&K was done only to please their voters. I hope they course correct here too and reverse the illegal changes made in J&K since August 2019.” Mr. Masoodi asked the Prime Minister to undertake a similar introspection in case of the 2019 decisions, whereby J&K was “unilaterally, unconstitutionally and unethically denuded of its special status, dismembered and downgraded to Union Territory”. He termed the Prime Minister’s move on farm laws “a clear shift from politics of arrogance to one of introspection and reappraisal”. Wider discussions He said, “It also depicts a realisation on the part of the Prime Minister and the Central government that before pushing through on the strength of majority legislation on important issues, the proposed legislation, in tune with the well-established democratic practices, should be placed in public domain for wider discussion and deliberations at pre-legislation stage.” The former judge-turned-parliamentarian said, “The fresh decision teaches us that there is nothing like ‘hands of a clock cannot be moved back’. The August 5, 2019 decisions, like farm laws, have resulted in death and destruction, uncertainty, and large-scale discontent. The decisions have widened the gulf between people of Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh and the rest of the country. It also has caused a huge drain on precious and scarce resources of the country that rightfully belong to the millions of underprivileged and disempowered countrymen.” “The political parties and the civil society groups at the national level should support just cause and political aspirations of the people of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh, like they extended unwavering support to the farmers’ struggle,” he further added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mehbooba-nc-urge-pm-to-revoke-2019-decisions/article37590796.ece
20 November 2021||New Delhi,||Decision seen as fallout of farmers’ protests in poll-bound U.P., Punjab||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement of withdrawing the three farm laws is being seen as a natural fallout of the traction that protests by farmers’ groups against them have had in the States going to the polls in early 2022, especially Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. BJP leaders from western U.P., speaking to The Hindu , said while the specifics of the laws did not affect farmers in the area, there was a “shared sense of grievance in terms of low returns on agriculture and soaring electricity bills”. “While the State Government did increase the procurement price of sugar cane [the main crop in the region], it was Rs. 10 less per hectare than what was demanded. What happened in Lakhimpur Kheri has also had a negative impact. The impending alliance between the Samajwadi Party and the Rashtriya Lok Dal would have been formidable if the issue of the farmers’ protests had not been resolved,” said a senior Union Minister. Union Home Minister Amit Shah is due to visit western U.P. in the next couple of weeks to hold meetings with booth in-charges of the BJP in the area, alluding to the fact that the area was a pain point as far as the State campaign went. In Punjab, the BJP is going to the polls on its own after decades, after the break-up of the alliance with the Akali Dal, and while the party claims support among the urban populace and largely Hindu sections, leaders of the party found it difficult to travel for campaigns in the face of opposition organised by farmers’ groups. The party also found that it could not take advantage of the fact that former Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh (retd) had announced the formation of a party after his exit from the Congress. Any alliance, both sides maintained, would be advantageous only when the farmers’ issue is resolved, as any association with the BJP without it was considered tainted with an anti-farmer hue. The fact that the Prime Minister announced the repeal of the laws on Gurpurab, the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev, also points to the fact that the movement, largely led by Sikh farmers in Punjab, had led to a situation where the BJP appeared at odds with the Sikh community, despite the long alliance between the BJP and the orthodox Akali Dal. This repeal, it is hoped, will put the clock back on this feeling of estrangement. Security concerns It was also felt by the security establishment that the long-running protests would be used by Khalistani elements to infiltrate the crowd and hijack the basic demands of the protesters into religious polarisation. “Punjab is a border State and concerns were raised at the highest levels that the protests could willy-nilly be infiltrated,” said a senior source in the Government. “Security concerns were prioritised,” he added. The Centre’s climbdown on the farm laws is being likened to its repeal of the Land Acquisition Ordinance in 2015, after sustained protests against it, and a sign that the Government remains politically pragmatic, constantly evaluating the fallout, in political and electoral terms, of its policies. For a Government that took many tough decisions, including demonetisation in 2016 and the reading down of Article 370 in 2019, this pragmatic turn is seen as a bit of a departure, but a realistic assessment shows that it is not so. Even when it came to tweaking the Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance and rates, the Gujarat polls in 2017 and the anger of traders in Surat had proven to be effective deterrents. Interestingly, this pragmatism was explained by a Chief Minister of a BJP-ruled State in 2015 after a meeting of Chief Ministers on the Land Acquisition Ordinance. “The Pandavas, during their feud with the Kauravas, had to endure a year of agyaatvaas [incognito], during which time even they served in the royal household of King Viraata of Matsyadesh, even though to act as such was against their royal character, because the situation demanded a strategic retreat in the larger interests of regaining their kingdom,” he had stated. The same principle seems to be now in play in the battle for Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, results of which will directly affect the mood of the Opposition ahead of the general election in 2024.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/decision-seen-as-fallout-of-farmers-protests-in-poll-bound-up-punjab/article37590823.ece
20 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||When the SC spoke its mind on Lakhimpur Kheri case||The Supreme Court’s intervention to protect the investigation in Uttar Pradesh following the murder of farmers at Lakhimpur Kheri. in which the son of a Union Minister is an accused. as well as the expressions of support for the farming community from the Bench of the Chief Justice of India created ripples days before the Prime Minister’s televised assurance to repeal the controversial farm laws on Friday. In its November 17 order, a Bench led by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana emphasised the cold cruelty of the crime by noting that the farmers, protesting the agricultural laws, were “rammed from behind” and “then run over” by the same SUV. The Supreme Court said the “tragic loss of lives” deserved an “impartial, fair, just and thorough investigation”. The court disapproved of the “slow pace, manner and outcome of the investigation conducted so far” by the Uttar Pradesh Police. November 17 also saw the Supreme Court lash out at “people sitting in Delhi in five-star and seven-star hotels” who blame farmers for the pollution. The court said such people do not understand the plight of farmers or their poverty. In an earlier hearing, Justice Surya Kant identified himself and Chief Justice Ramana as “farmers”. “I am a farmer, the CJI is a farmer… we know,” Justice Kant had told the government. However, the court had not been so empathetic on October 1. A Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar had accused farmers of “strangulating the city”. On that day, the court was hearing a petition filed by farmers’ bodies for permission to hold a satyagraha at the iconic Jantar Mantar in the heart of the Capital. On October 4, a day after eight people, including four farmers were mowed down at Lakhimpur Kheri, the farmers’ plea to hold a satyagraha had again come up before the same Bench. This time, the Bench had asked why the farmers were continuing to protest when the case against the farm laws was pending in the Supreme Court. Justice Khanwilkar observed the farm laws were passed by the Parliament. “The government is also bound by the laws passed by the Parliament... We are on principle here. Once you go to court, how can you say ‘the matter is before court, nevertheless I will still protest’,” the judge had queried. The Bench had said that when incidents like Lakhimpur Kheri happen, causing deaths, loss to property and damage, “nobody takes responsibility”. The Bench that day noted the “central issue” here was whether the right to protest was an “absolute right”. The court had said it would decide whether farmers’ bodies could resort to protests on a subject — the legality of three farm laws — which was sub judice. The observations from this Bench came despite the oft-taken view by another apex court Bench led by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul that farmers had every right to protest peacefully without disturbing the right to public movement. However, 48 hours after the hearing before Justice Khanwilkar’s Bench, the Lakhimpur Kheri incident was taken up by the Chief Justice’s Bench on October 6, and listed for hearing the very next day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/when-the-sc-spoke-its-mind-on-lakhimpur-kheri-case/article37590800.ece
20 November 2021||New Delhi,||Shah praises J&K police for ushering in change||Union Home Minister Amit Shah discussed the challenges posed by radicalisation among other internal security issues with senior police officers on the inaugural day of the annual Director General of Police (DGP) conference being held in in Lucknow, a Home Ministry statement said. The Minister praised the Intelligence Bureau and the J&K Police for ushering change in the newly created Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir post-August 2019. More investment He claimed that after the special status of the former State under Article 370 was read down by the Parliament in 2019, the Union Territory had attracted an investment of Rs. 13,000 crore. Mr. Shah inaugurated the 56th DGP conference organized by the Intelligence Bureau on Friday. The DGsP of all States and DGs of Central Armed Police Forces are attending from police headquarters at Lucknow. In addition, about 350 officers are attending the same through virtual platform from IB offices in various States. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will preside over subsequent sessions on Saturday and Sunday. Mr. Shah lauded the role played by security forces during the COVID pandemic. “The Home Minister stressed for better coordination between the State Police and other Central agencies and urged the delegates for timely implementation of suggestions discussed during the conference”, the statement said. The Minister also stressed on the need to focus on security-related issues including coastal security, Left Wing Extremism, Narcotics Trafficking, Cyber-crime, Border Area Management and reforms at police stations. “Deliberations were held on a wide range of internal security issues, including prison reforms, challenges posed by radicalisation and police training. A presentation by NATGRID was also made during the conference. The focus of the presentations was to highlight the challenges and suggest roadmaps for overcoming the same,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/shah-praises-jk-police-for-ushering-in-change/article37590837.ece
20 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Indigenous chopper, drones handed over to armed forces||Admission of girls has started from this session in 33 Sainik schools, and Rani Laxmibai-like daughters will emerge to take responsibility of defence, security and development of the country on their shoulders, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday at the Rashtriya Raksha Samarpan Parv in Jhansi. He handed over the indigenously-built Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) to the Air Force, two small drones built by Indian start-ups to the Army, and electronic warfare suites to the Navy. “For a long time, India has been counted among the largest arms importers in the world, but today the mantra of the country is Make in India, Make for the world. Today India is working to make its forces self-reliant,” Mr. Modi said. “Today, here from Jhansi, a new chapter in India’s defence sector is being written. India’s borders will now be even more secure,” he said after laying the foundation stone for a Rs. 400 crore project by Bharat Dynamics Limited for the manufacture of propulsion systems of Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGM). The three-day Parv in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh is being organised as part of the ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahaotsav’ celebrations by the MoD, along with the Uttar Pradesh Government. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated the three-day event on November 17. Sculpture unveiled Mr. Modi also formally launched several schemes of the Defence Ministry and unveiled the sculpture of Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi on her 193rd birth anniversary at the precincts of the Jhansi Fort. The twin-engine LCH designed and developed by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) is a 5-8 tonne class combat helicopter. It is the only attack helicopter in the world that can land and take off at an altitude of 5,000 m (16,400 ft), with considerable weapons and fuel load, significantly augmenting the firepower of the IAF and Army in high altitude areas. The LCH will eventually be deployed along the Line of Actual Control with China, in addition to the AH-64E Apache helicopters in service. The Prime Minister also handed over DRDO-designed and Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) manufactured advanced Electronic Warfare suites to the Navy. The first Shakti system has been installed on-board the stealth destroyer Visakhapatnam to be commissioned on Sunday, and another is being installed on-board the indigenous aircraft carrier Vikrant. Twelve Shakti systems are under production at Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) supported by more than 50 MSMEs, at a total cost of Rs. 1,805 crore, the Defence Ministry said. “These systems are scheduled to be installed on-board capital warships under production, including P-15B, P-17A and Talwar class follow-on ships,” it stated. The plant by BDL will be spread over 183 acres in the Jhansi node of U.P. Defence Industrial Corridor and is expected to provide direct employment to 150 people and indirect employment to nearly 500 people, the Ministry said.  The Cabinet had recently approved the setting up of 100 Sainik Schools throughout the country under public-private model. At least one Sainik School is proposed in each State and Union Territory and these 100 Sainik Schools would be set up in the next two years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-is-working-to-make-its-forces-self-reliant-says-modi/article37590798.ece
20 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Weigh future potential when awarding relief: SC||The real possibility that a bright future was in store for a young accident victim before it was cut short tragically should be considered while determining compensation, the Supreme Court observed in a judgment. “To have the perception that he is likely to remain static and his income to remain stagnant is contrary to the fundamental concept of human attitude which always intends to live with dynamism and move and change with the time,” a Bench led by Justice M.R. Shah said. The court was dealing with the death of a 21-year-old engineering student in an accident. The Madhya Pradesh High Court calculated his monthly income at Rs. 5,000. Justice Shah said the court had committed a grave error. “Even labourers were getting Rs. 5,000 per month under the Minimum Wages Act... the High Court ought not to have considered the income of the deceased at Rs. 5,000,” the court observed. Justice Shah noted “the High Court has not considered the future rise in income while awarding the future loss of income”. “Looking to the educational qualification and the family background, the deceased was to have a bright future. We are of the opinion that the income of the deceased at least ought to be Rs. 10,000,” the court said. The future rise of income of the road accident victim should be taken into consideration even if he or she was not earning at the time of death. The prospective rise in income should be calculated after considering cumulative factors, namely, passage of time, the changing society, escalation of price, the change in price index, the human attitude to follow a particular pattern of life, etc. “We are of the opinion that even in case of a deceased who was not serving at the time of death and had no income at the time of death, their legal heirs shall also be entitled to future prospects by adding future rise in income, i.e., addition of 40% of the income determined on guesswork considering the educational qualification, family background etc., where the deceased was below the age of 40 years,” the court held.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/weigh-future-potential-when-awarding-relief-sc/article37591070.ece
20 November 2021||Mumbai,||Bombay High Court quashes conviction in POCSO case||Almost three years after a man was convicted of sexually harassing and assaulting a minor, the Bombay High Court has acquitted him on the grounds that the statement of the four-year-old victim cannot be relied upon. A single bench was hearing a criminal appeal filed by Laxman Varma, challenging an order passed by the special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act court that sentenced him to rigorous imprisonment for 10 years. The High Court held that the sessions judge failed to evaluate the reliability of the four-year-old. “The tenor of the answers given by the victim indicate that she did not have either cognitive skills to remember, recollect and narrate the incident or the intellectual capacity and maturity to understand the nature of questions.Consequently, the girl cannot be considered to be a competent witness,” the court said quashing the conviction. On May 11, 2017, the girl had complained to her mother of pain in her private part. She told her that Varma, who was hired to paint a neighbouring house, made her sit on his lap and touched her inappropriately. Soon after a chargesheet was filed and after a trial, Varma was convicted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bombay-high-court-quashes-conviction-in-pocso-case/article37590836.ece
20 November 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||With NEP mandate, Odisha bats for tribals’ mother tongue||The new National Education Policy lays emphasis on imparting teaching in mother tongue in primary classes. But when the language-base of Odisha’s adivasi communities is as diverse as 21 spoken languages further divided into 74 dialects, the task appears to be quite onerous. However, Odisha’s decade-long experiment in multi-lingual education may come in handy to take up the challenge. The ST and SC Development Department of the State government has already started working on project called ‘Samhati’ to address the language issues faced by tribal students in early grades or elementary classes. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Research and Training Institute (SCSTRTI) along with the Academy of Tribal Language and Culture (ATLC), Bhubaneswar are implementing the project. The department manages 1,732 residential educational institutions across the State. More than 4.5 lakh tribal and Scheduled Caste students from primary to secondary level with free lodging, 85 boarding facilities are managed by the department. Now under, Samhati, the department plans to cover approximately 2.5 lakh students in 1,450 primary schools in the State. In addition, the School and Mass Education department also manages about 1,500 schools in 17 tribal dominated districts where students are taught in tribal languages. As many as 3,328 teachers and 222 language teachers are in place to impart teaching in tribal languages. Of the 21 languages, Santhali — the only language which has been included in eighth schedule of Constitution — is taught in its own ol chiki script while rest of tribal languages have Odia scripts.  Although it is easy to prescribe mother tongue as medium of instruction up to Class V, it is tough to implement. Odisha is home to 62 tribal communities including 13 particularly vulnerable tribal groups (PVTGs), making it the State with the most diverse indigenous communities in India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/with-nep-mandate-odisha-bats-for-tribals-mother-tongue/article37591655.ece
20 November 2021||LUCKNOW,||HC presses Centre on Uniform Civil Code||Stating that the Uniform Civil Code “is a necessity and mandatorily required today,” the Allahabad High Court has called upon the Central Government to forthwith initiate the process for its implementation. The UCC “cannot be made ‘purely voluntary’ as was observed by Dr. B.R Ambedkar 75 years back, in view of the apprehension and fear expressed by the members of the minority community,” Justice Suneet Kumar said on November 18. The Court directed the Centre to consider the constitution of a committee or commission for implementing the mandate of Article 44, as directed by the Supreme Court.  Unity through code “A common civil code will help the cause of national integration by removing disparate loyalties to laws which have conflicting ideologies. No community is likely to bell the cat by making gratuitous concessions on this issue. It is the State which is charged with the duty of securing a uniform civil code for the citizens of the country and, unquestionably, it has the legislative competence to do so,” the court observed. Justice Kumar made the observations while hearing a bunch of 17 petitions filed by inter-faith couples, seeking protection of their life, liberty and privacy guaranteed under Article 21, to live independently as man and woman without the interference of the their family or others. Noting that there has been a steep rise in inter-community, inter-caste and interfaith marriages and relationships, which has exploded specially in the last few decades, the court said that since 1950 the society has considerably evolved and the relationships, be it interfaith, inter-culture, coupled with the rise in the number of single women requires a comprehensive Family Code which is in conformity with the changing times. Holding that “Intimacies of marriage lie within a core zone of privacy, which is inviolable”, Justice Kumar said, “The absolute right of an individual to choose a life partner is not in the least affected by matters of faith.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-presses-centre-on-uniform-civil-code/article37590794.ece

According to the Odisha School Education Programme Authority (OSEPA), more than 302 textbooks and 2,500 supplementary reading materials including story books and pictures charts in 21 tribal languages have been developed. Although it is easy to prescribe mother tongue as medium of instruction up to Class V, it is very difficult to implement. Odisha is home to 62 different tribal communities including 13 particularly vulnerable tribal groups (PVTGs), making it the State with the most diverse indigenous communities in the country. “Since the ST and SC department runs residential schools, it enrols students from all tribal communities in every school. These students are multi-lingual group unlike mono-lingual groups in regular schools. So it is not practically possible to recruit teachers for each tribal language in a single school,” said a researcher. Now, under Samhati, it has been decided that all teachers of primary level would be provided functional knowledge of tribal languages. “The most important aspect of the mother-tongue based education is that it helps save endangered tribal language,” said Paramananda Patel, a tribal language researcher. SCSTRTI Director A.B. Ota said, “We have already prepared bilingual dictionaries in 21 languages and distributed them. Trilingual proficiency module which will help a person learn tribal languages has also been prepared.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nep-mandate-odisha-bats-for-tribal-tongues/article37590791.ece

20 November 2021||November 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Farmers hail victory, but won’t wind up strike now||It said that they had also called for a statutory legal guarantee that all farmers will receive Minimum Support Prices for their produce and withdrawal of the Electricity Amendment Bill. Describing the repeal of farm laws as just “one step” towards resolving farmers’ demands, the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) said that they would decide on the future course of the agitation only after the SKM meeting on Saturday. “Our demand for a law on guaranteed MSP is still pending. The promise of forming a committee will not do. We will wait for clarity on other issues and the repeal of the laws in the Parliament,” general secretary of BKU Yudhvir Singh told The Hindu . The timing of the decision, Mr. Singh said, had once again proved that “those ruling us are no saints and that they think only in terms of political profit and loss.” “Had they been sensitive towards farmers, they would not have allowed 700 peasants to die over the last one year. That’s why we can’t welcome the move; it is just a step,” he said. Dharmendra Malik, media in-charge BKU, said it was the victory of a non-violent movement led by farmers against the arrogance of a few powerful individuals. “ Der aaye durust aaye (better late than never) but concerns remain. It is the first victory achieved through the unity, struggle and sacrifice of farmers,” he said. As the news broke on Friday morning, farmers camped at the Ghazipur border celebrated by distributing ladoos and jalebis , and raising slogans of unity. A ritual was conducted to honour the memory of the over 500 farmers who lost their lives during the agitation and to seek sadbuddhi (good sense) for the government to honour its promises and concede the demand for guaranteed MSP. Sanjay Singh, a lawyer from Meerut with a farming background, said the government forgot that for a farmer “hoplessness is a sin”. “It is hope that keeps him spirited in a harsh occupation. How could he have lost this battle against a few proud men who don’t understand the pulse of rural India,” Mr. Singh said. Pavan Khatana, a spokesperson of BKU from Gautam Buddha Nagar, said the Union was not in the electoral game but only those should vote for the BJP who are ready to spend a year on the road for their just demands. “We have seen private mandis coming up despite the laws being put on hold by the Supreme Court. So, you never know...” Vijendra Yadav, a farmer leader from Sambhal, said the farmers could not forget that they were termed Khalistanis, anti-nationals, and andolanjivis (professional agitators) for asking what was their due. Bhagwan Das, a small farmer from Kanpur said the government had promised to give Rs. 10,000 by direct transfer to street vendors.  “My son’s chat stall was shut down because of COVID but we have yet to receive any payment. The elections could be held but the schools and shops could not open. Is it justified,” he asked. BKS opposes decision Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), affiliated to the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) has opposed the Centre’s decision to repeal the farm laws, saying it will result in “long-term damage” to farmers’ interests. According to the BKS, the real problem facing farmers was exploitation in the market. The BKS demanded that farmers be protected by the enactment of law guaranteeing remunerative prices for their produce.

Official sources said the bodies of Bhat, who owned the building where the incident took place, and Dr. Gul, who had a rented accommodation in the building, were taken to the Police Control Room (PCR) in Srinagar from Handwara. The close relatives were called and the bodies handed over to them for burial at the ancestral graveyards in Srinagar. Family sources of Bhat and Dr. Gul said the bodies would be buried before the sunrise at the Barzalla and Pirbagh graveyards. Srinagar Mayor Junaid Azim Mattu, while confirming that the bodies were exhumed at Handwara, said, “This is the first step towards ensuring justice is done in this case. I also hope the magisterial probe is now changed into a judicial probe.” However, the body of third slain local Amir Magray, son of Abdul Latief Magray who had won the bravery award for killing a militant with a stone, has not been exhumed. Political parties, including the National Conference, Peoples Democratic Party and the Peoples Conference, have urged the administration to return the body of Magray too. The Peoples Alliance for the Gupkar Declaration on Friday wrote to President Ram Nath Kovind. “The right to decent burial is well recognised in the Constitution of India as well as in the international humanitarian law,” Gupkar alliance president Dr. Farooq Abdullah, also a Member Parliament, said in the letter. Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq has alleged “inhuman treatment of the families of the slain civilians and the bodies of those killed in the Hyderpora operation”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jk-operation-bodies-handed-over-to-families/article37590803.ece

We tried engaging them in dialogue, we listened to their arguments and the logic that they put forward, we agreed to suspend the implementation of these laws for two years, and the matter has also been put before the Supreme Court. “Particular sections of the laws that they objected to were also removed, but may be there was something lacking somewhere that we were not able to convince this section of farmers,” he observed. “On this auspicious day of Gurpurab [birth anniversary of Guru Nanak], I appeal to all farmers who are protesting to return home in good spirits,” he said. The announcement comes in the backdrop of coming Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, where the protests have had some traction. Mr. Modi peppered his speech with mentions of all pro-farmer initiatives undertaken by the government, including crop insurance, payment of income support to small farmers (Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi) and neem-coated urea. He ended his speech invoking Guru Nanak’s prayer that enjoined never fearing to do the right thing. “Whatever I did, it was for the benefit of farmers and I shall continue to do so,” he asserted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-relents-decides-to-spike-farm-laws/article37590804.ece
20 November 2021||LUCKNOW,||‘Fear of elections made Modi revoke farm laws’||Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav on Friday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to repeal the three new farm laws was taken due to the fear of losing the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly election. Mr. Yadav said the BJP was rattled by the massive turnout in favour of the SP in the State. “The decision is in the interest of the farmer, but somewhere the Government is scared of elections. They have taken back the laws for votes,” he said at a press conference. “This is a defeat of arrogance, a victory of farmers, a victory of democracy.” The Government panicked and took back the laws, but it was possible that it might bring another such law after the election, he said. Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati said the decision to take back the farm laws should have been taken earlier. She sought the introduction of a law for guaranteed minimum support price (MSP) in the winter session of Parliament.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fear-of-elections-made-modi-revoke-farm-laws/article37590817.ece
20 November 2021||New Delhi,||Will observe ‘Kisan Vijay Diwas’ today, says Cong.||Accusing the Narendra Modi Government of deciding to repeal the three farm laws because of the impending Assembly elections in five States, including Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, the Congress on Friday decided to observe November 20 as “Kisan Vijay Diwas” to celebrate the victory of the farmers. While congratulating the farmers for forcing the Government to accept their demands after a year, the party credited former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi with leading a “united Opposition in the uncompromising year-long fight” against the Modi Government. Compensating families The Congress and the Left parties also raised the issue of compensating the families of over 700 farmers who died during the year-long agitation. In a statement, Congress president Sonia Gandhi said the Government and citizens need to think about “how farming can be made profitable in the true sense and how farmers get a fair price for their crop by way of minimum support price [MSP]”. “Today, the anti-farmer, anti-labourer conspiracy hatched by the people in power has also been defeated, and the arrogance of the dictatorial rulers too. Today, the conspiracy to attack livelihood and farming also stands defeated,” Ms. Gandhi said. In an open letter to farmers, Mr. Gandhi complimented the farmers for “forcing a dictatorial ruler to shed his arrogance through Gandhian non-violent ways”, but claimed that the fight was not over yet. He said the Congress would stand shoulder to shoulder with the farmers in the future as well as in their demand for MSP, rollback of decisions regarding electricity usage in the farm sector, reduction in taxes on agricultural implements and the lowering of diesel prices. Asking the Prime Minister to apologise for causing all the hardship to farmers, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury tweeted, “Parliament, while repealing the black farm laws, must enact legal entitlement to sell at MSP”. CPI general secretary D. Raja said, “Prime Minister should answer why it took so long to repeal, claiming the lives of more than 600 farmers and led to the brutality of Lakhimpur Kheri.”  The anti-farmer, anti-labourer conspiracy hatched by the people in power has also been defeated Sonia Gandhi Congress president||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/will-observe-kisan-vijay-diwas-today-says-cong/article37590818.ece

Trust was identified as the overarching element of the SMART policing vision,” the survey said. The SMART scores are set on a scale of 1 to 10 and are indicative of the levels of citizen satisfaction, a score of 10 being the highest level of satisfaction. With a perception score of 5.74, Bihar ranked the lowest in ‘sensitivity’, while the score for Uttar Pradesh was 5.81. It was followed by Chhattisgarh at 5.93. With a score of 8.11 and 8.10, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana police topped the ranking. In police responsiveness too, the Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh police scored the lowest, while Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Assam scored the highest. ‘Police doing job well’ “Despite being attacked for insufficient sensitivity, declining public confidence and growing concerns about the quality of policing, a majority of citizens [a weighted average of 66.93%] believes that the police are doing their job well and strongly support the police,” the report stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bihar-up-police-seen-as-less-sensitive-survey/article37591071.ece

In a note shared on social media, the Governor has sought details of the proceedings in seven days. The Assembly on November 16 had passed a resolution demanding the withdrawal of the Centre’s notification to increase the jurisdiction of the BSF from 15 km to 50 km. The resolution, brought under Rule 169 of rules and procedure of the House, was passed with majority vote. On November 17, a breach of privilege motion against the CBI and the ED was moved by Trinamool Congress’s Tapas Roy. The TMC is upset that the consent of the Speaker was not taken by the Central agencies before filing charge sheets against members of the House in the Narada sting videos case. Mr. Dhankhar wrote, “Attention of the Hon’ble Speaker be drawn also to the fact on earlier occasions also proceedings were sought but unfortunately the same are not being made available. Such a state of affairs is not only proper, but unacceptable and is also unconstitutional.” Minister Partha Chatterjee said the Governor was trying to disrupt the functioning of the Assembly. The House was independent in itself and the resolutions were discussed and passed as per procedure, he said. Speaker Biman Banerjee said he would make the proceedings of the House available to the Governor if he asked formally through an official letter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dhankhar-seeks-details-on-wb-assembly-resolutions/article37590835.ece

As of October 11, the FCI had boiled rice stock of 46.28 lakh tonnes and another 32.73 lakh tonnes was yet to reach its godowns. With a storage of 79 lakh tonnes thus, the FCI had stocks to meet the requirements of boiled rice consuming States for four years. The annual consumption in these States was only 20 lakh tonnes. Also, the boiled rice consuming States have stepped up their own production, slowing down movement of stocks from FCI godowns. On the other hand, Telangana produced boiled rice, but consumed raw rice which added to piling up of stocks.

The court noted on Thursday that the new anti-conversion law in Uttar Pradesh, which was brought in by the Government last year per se did not prohibit interfaith marriage but the requirement of approval by the district authorities could make it tedious for such couples. “Such an approval is directory and not mandatory. If interpreted otherwise, the Act [The Uttar Pradesh Prevention of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act, 2021] would not satisfy the test of reasonableness and fairness, and would fail to pass the muster of Article 14 and Article 21,” it stated. The High Court, while allowing the petitions, observed that the consent of the family or the community or the State was not necessary, once two adult individuals agreed to enter into a wedlock that was legal, and directed the police to ensure the safety of the couples and provide protection to them if needed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/court-bats-for-interfaith-couples/article37590801.ece

20 November 2021||Pune,||Farm laws repeal: Modi’s ‘tactical retreat’ won’t save BJP in Assembly polls, says farmer leader||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s repeal of the controversial farm laws proved that democracy was still “alive and well” in the country, farmer leader and Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS) chief Raju Shetti said on Friday. This ‘tactical move’, he added, would not help swing the BJP’s fortunes in the coming Assembly elections in five States. Speaking to The Hindu from Kolhapur, Mr. Shetti said the Centre’s backing down in the face of collective farmer protests was “a historic occasion”, while adding that the announcement to repeal the contentious laws would have made a greater impact had it been done on January 26 this year itself. “It is now almost a year since the farmers began their mega protests, which were peaceful…, the Centre tried every trick in their book to defame and break the movement, and even tried to incite violence. However, the farmers firmly stood their ground and the Centre had to roll back these laws,” he said. Mr. Shetti said the BJP had realised too late that the mood of the crucial farmer constituency had swung against them. “In U.P.’s Lakhimpur Kheri, a Minister’s son mows down farmers with impunity during a protest…this arrogance and corruption has marked the Modi regime and the BJP-ruled State Governments. Now, the Centre realises that the farmer vote is moving away from them.” Mr. Shetti further stated that getting the Centre to back off on the farm laws was not the achievement of any single farmer leader but of the farmers as a whole. He compared the farmers’ win to Mahatma Gandhi’s non-violent methods which helped topple the British Raj and stated that the victory was remarkable given that the BJP had steamrolled the bills in both Houses of Parliament. “The announcement proves that even Prime Minister Modi had to bow before the resolution of the majority…while it has become a fashion nowadays for those in power at the Centre [the BJP] and their adherents to make fun of Gandhiji’s ideas, the farmers’ victory only proves the relevance of the great man’s ideas,” Mr. Shetti remarked. The SSS president had last year questioned the manner in which the agrarian bills were passed in Parliament.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farm-laws-repeal-modis-tactical-retreat-wont-save-bjp-in-assembly-polls-says-farmer-leader/article37590820.ece
20 November 2021||New Delhi,||DRI seizes 85.53 kg of smuggled gold||In a major operation, the Directorate of Revenue of Intelligence (DRI) has seized 85.53 kg of gold worth about Rs. 42 crore and detained four foreign nationals, who were allegedly involved in smuggling. While one suspect is from Taiwan, two are from South Korea and another one is from China. “One of the Korean nationals and the Chinese national had come in contact with each other when they were earlier lodged in jail on the charge of gold smuggling,” an official said. During the operation code named ‘Molten Metal’, the agency initially identified several Indian and foreign (Chinese, Taiwanese and South Korean) nationals suspected to be indulging in smuggling gold into India from Hong Kong using the air cargo route. Intelligence inputs indicated that gold smuggled in the form of machinery parts was being melted and moulded into bar/cylinder shapes before being disposed of in the local market. Based on the findings, DRI sleuths examined an import consignment at the cargo complex of Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport. They detected a consignment of electroplating machines fitted with transformers which had laminatons made out of gold coated nickel.  The suspects were using sophisticated metallurgical techniques to convert the smuggled gold in the form of transformer laminations into bar/cylindrical form for further distribution, the agency said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dri-seizes-8553-kg-of-smuggled-gold/article37590832.ece

20 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||99 streets remain flooded; alert for northern areas||A total of 99 streets spread over 39 areas in the city were flooded on Friday because of local civic issues and release of water from reservoirs on the outskirts of the city. More areas are likely to be flooded on Saturday as there have been reports of huge inflow from Andhra Pradesh. The Greater Chennai Corporation brought down the number of flooded areas from 779 to 39 on Friday, deploying additional manpower, digging temporary drains and pumping water. The city received 2 mm rain on Friday but parts of north Chennai remained flooded. The city received 726 mm rain between October 25 and November 18. About 46 mm rain was recorded in the city in 24 hours ending 6 a.m. on Friday. Of the 837 motor pumps hired by the Corporation, 341 were operated on Friday. Work on 2,300 complaints were taken up in various parts of the city on Friday. More than 25,000 complaints have been redressed. As many as 645 people have been accommodated in flood shelters. Meanwhile, the Corporation on Friday issued a flood alert in parts of north Chennai owing to the release of water from Poondi reservoir. Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi visited the banks of the Kosasthalaiyar to assess the situation and inspected the relief centres set up in various parts of the river basin. Huge inflow Officials made an announcement about the release of water from Poondi reservoir in various low-lying areas in north Chennai. About 30,000 cusecs of water was released from Poondi reservoir on Friday because of huge inflow from Andhra Pradesh. “The inflow has crossed 45,000 cusecs. But the water released is only 30,000 cusecs. “More than 45,000 cusecs is expected to be released on Friday night. So, residents along the Kosasthalaiyar have to be prepared for the rise in water level. Residents in low-lying areas will be taken to relief shelters,” said an official. On Friday, flooding was reported in many areas such as Manali New Town. Corporation officials visited the localities to carry out relief and rescue work. “We have shifted residents belonging to the Irula tribe to relief shelters. They were living along the banks of the Kosasthalaiyar. We have given them food,” said Mr. Bedi. Water was pumped out from parts of West Mambalam and T.

20 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||West Velachery residents demand one more drain||Residents of west Velachery, which was severely affected by flooding in the recent heavy rain, are demanding an additional stormwater drain network for faster discharge of rainwater into the Veerangal Odai. The Veerangal Odai drains into the Pallikaranai marshland through a culvert under the southern arm of the Inner Ring Road extension near Velachery railway station. Several residential areas in west Velachery such as AGS Colony and Saraswathi Nagar and areas like Vijayanagar, Muruga Nagar, Padmavathi Nagar, Ram Nagar and Srinivasa Nagar were severely inundated causing hardship to hundreds of residents. The presence of the Veerangal Odai turned out to be a blessing as well as curse as the overflowing water in it prevents the rainwater from west Velachery’s stormwater drains from flowing into the canal. As part of the mitigation measures, the Greater Chennai Corporation built a pump room and installed a nearly 100-horsepower (HP) motor to pump out the water from the stormwater drains. But this year, the residents of AGS Colony, Saraswathi Nagar and a few streets of Kalki Nagar were badly affected by flooding for more than two days. Geetha Ganesh, an office-bearer of the AGS Colony Residents Welfare Association, wanted a retaining wall to be built along the drain at Saraswathi Nagar to prevent backflow. Also a new drain or a macro canal should be built at AGS Colony and linked to the Odai to drain out the rainwater, she said. A senior official of the Corporation said that at present three pumps had been installed in these localities to drain the stagnant rainwater into the Veerangal Odai. Regarding the construction of a macro canal and retaining wall for the drain at Saraswathi Nagar, a study would be done on this, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/west-velachery-residents-demand-one-more-drain/article37591208.ece
20 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Care Earth Trust develops crowd-sourced flood risk map||Care Earth Trust, a city-based biodiversity research organisation, has developed a flood risk map for the city. It is based on the citizen responses on waterlogged areas during the recent rain. The map has plotted 250 intensively flooded areas in many parts of the city, including Ashok Nagar, Kolathur, Porur, Anna Nagar, Velachery, Koyambedu, Kodambakkam, Teynampet, Kundrathur, Tambaram, Chromepet and Selaiyur. It was based on 900 responses at the street-level sought from residents since November 11. Spearheaded by Stephen Jeyaseelan, GIS cell lead, Care Earth Trust, the map has some core areas in the city which were not usually affected during monsoon. These included some parts of T. Nagar, Alwarpet and Rukmani Lakshmipathi Salai in Egmore. Normally, low-level areas or those near waterways and waterbodies are prone to waterlogging. But residents of some core areas did not have an idea of source of sudden flooding that took many days to recede. The responses were sought through social media and online forms. Jayshree Vencatesan, managing trustee, Care Earth Trust, said this was not an exhaustive map and this does not mean there was no inundation in other places. “We are still getting responses and plan to prepare zone-wise flood risk maps to develop area specific flood proofing plans. The same action plan for flood mitigation may not work for the entire city and need to be decentralised,” she said. The trust is analysing the triggers for localised flooding during this northeast monsoon. “We also plan to create more maps by analysing the changes and flood patterns during the years 2005, 2015 and 2021. The maps developed would be shared with the government agencies,” she said. Residents may send responses about flooding in their area on careearthtrust.org or fill the forms- https://forms.gle/QKyG1QyAniKu6bQK7.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/care-earth-trust-develops-crowd-sourced-flood-risk-map/article37591192.ece
20 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Decks cleared for T.N. farm law||With the Union Government deciding to repeal three farm laws, the decks have been cleared for the implementation of the amendment made last year to the Tamil Nadu Agricultural Produce Marketing (Regulation) Act (the APMC Act), which is aimed at, among others, giving freedom to agriculturists to sell their produce across time and space. On May 29, 2020, the then AIADMK government got an ordinance promulgated to amend the APMC Act, which covered a host of areas, such as providing for geographically restriction-free trade or transaction of agricultural produce across the State; enhancing transparency in trade; promoting emergence of multiple channels to competitive marketing; and encouraging investments in development of markets and marketing infrastructure. A week later, on June 5, the Union Government came out with three ordinances, including the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Law, which had enlarged the scope of ‘trade area’ to any area or location or place of production, collection and aggregation anywhere in the country for the trade of farmers’ produce. However, this was not applicable to the physical boundaries of those market yards or markets falling under the State APMC Acts. It was this aspect of allowing barrier-free trade of farmers’ produce outside the markets notified under the State APMC laws became the cause of agitation by sections of farmers. Though Tamil Nadu has been allowing virtually deregulated conditions for the farm market, it has not disturbed the power of the market committees, set up under the APMC Act, to monitor transactions taking place outside the regulated markets. The May 2020 ordinance, too, had left this aspect intact. However, with the constitutional position of a Central law prevailing over a State law on the same subject, the Tamil Nadu Government did not proceed to frame the rules, despite getting the ordinance approved by the Assembly in the form of a Bill and cleared by the then Governor Banwarilal Purohit in October. After the DMK took over in May this year, it got a Bill through the House to repeal the Tamil Nadu Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2019, the subject of which was covered in another Central law. Enquiries reveal that Governor R.N. Ravi’s assent is awaited for the repeal Bill.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/decks-cleared-for-tn-farm-law/article37591211.ece
20 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Vaccination must for being in public places||Through a circular issued on Thursday, the Directorate of Public Health has made vaccination against COVID-19 mandatory for people in public places in Tamil Nadu. In a move to make COVID-19 vaccination compulsory for the eligible population, the Directorate of Public Health (DPH) and Preventive Medicine has invoked provisions under the Tamil Nadu Public Health Act, 1939, to ensure that public places, including markets, theatres and factories, are occupied only by those vaccinated against COVID-19. Over the past few weeks, the uptake of vaccination, both among those yet to take the first dose and those due/overdue for the second, has slowed down in the State. The overall coverage of inoculation stands at 6,45,72,433. In the circular issued to deputy directors of health services and the city medical officer of the Greater Chennai Corporation, T.S. Selvavinayagam, Director of Public Health, said under Section 76 clause (b) of sub-section (2) of the Act, the DPH had the power to make vaccination and preventive inoculations compulsory, subject to provisions of sub-section (3). The DPH has instructed its deputy directors to implement certain provisions of the Act “suitably informing the owner/occupier” of the listed places, and ensure that all places notified under Section 71 sub-section (1) are occupied by persons “who are vaccinated against COVID-19” to prevent the spread of the infection. Under Section 71 sub-section (1), no person who knows that he is suffering from a notified disease shall expose other people to the risk of infection, by his presence or conduct, in any street or public place, market, theatre or other place of entertainment or assembly, school, college, playground, hotel, hostel, boarding house, choultry, resthouse or club, any factory or shop. As per the Act, the DPH may, from time to time, as occasion requires, recommend for the adoption by any local authority, measures necessary for improving the public health administration in the local area or for safeguarding public health, the circular said. Dr. Selvavinayagam said they would be requesting owners/occupiers to ensure that only vaccinated people are allowed. “It is a step towards a safe Tamil Nadu. With 74% first-dose coverage and 37% second-dose coverage, this strategy will definitely help us reach the unvaccinated,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vaccination-must-for-being-in-public-places/article37591174.ece

20 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Two doctors sacked from service||The Directorate of Medical Education (DME) has terminated the services of the two doctors, who were arrested on charges of rape and molestation of two women colleagues. According to officials, the two doctors were non-service postgraduates who were working at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital during the bond period. They were involved in COVID-19 duty. On Thursday, they were arrested for allegedly raping a woman doctor and molesting another woman doctor while in hotel quarantine during COVID-19 duty. Following their arrest, Director of Medical Education R. Narayana Babu said they were terminated from service. “We have issued instructions to all deans of government medical college hospitals, resident medical officers and heads of departments to periodically visit hotels where doctors and nurses were being accommodated during COVID-19 duty and quarantine period. They should look into complaints, including of harassments, and take action accordingly,” he said. Quarantine to end Doctors were being provided accommodation in hotels since May 2020 when there was total lockdown in view of rising COVID-19 cases, he said. “Now, COVID-19 cases have declined. For instance, there are only about 100 patients in the five medical college hospitals in Chennai. There is no longer a lockdown and regular traffic has resumed, while 100% vaccination coverage of our healthcare personnel has been achieved. Their family members have also been vaccinated. So, there is no need for hotel quarantine. We may vacate the hotels and provide accommodation for doctors on COVID-19 duty at the respective institutions,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/two-doctors-sacked-from-service/article37591209.ece

20 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||No more fuel tax cuts: Thiaga Rajan||Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan on Friday ruled out any further cut in the State taxes on fuel as the Union Government’s taxes remained “exorbitant” and the State would face an additional revenue loss of about Rs. 1,050 crore a year because of the Union Government’s tax cut. Pointing out that Tamil Nadu was the first State to reduce the tax on petrol by Rs. 3 a litre, he said the Union Government’s reduction in tax by Rs. 5 a litre on petrol and Rs. 10 a litre on diesel would result in a revenue loss of Rs. 1,050 to the State annually. This was because Tamil Nadu levied ‘ad valorem’ taxes. This would be in addition to the loss of around Rs. 1,160 crore a year on account of the State Government’s decision to cut the taxes. He said in a statement that the Union Government’s request to the States to reduce their taxes was “not reasonable”. Mr. Thiaga Rajan said there were many components such as basic price, Union excise and cesses/surcharges on the basic price, transport costs and State Government taxes. The Minister said the Union Government had continuously increased the taxes on petrol and diesel over the past seven years. “If it were to reduce the taxes to the 2014 rates, the State tax — levied as an ad valorem tax on the sum of basic price and Union government levy — will automatically reduce.” “On August 1, 2014, the basic price was Rs. 48.55 a litre for petrol and Rs. 47.27 a litre for diesel. On November 4, 2021, the basic price of petrol was Rs. 48.36 a litre, while that of diesel was Rs. 49.69 a litre. On August 1, 2014, the Union Government taxes were Rs. 9.48 a litre on petrol and Rs. 3.57 a litre on diesel. At that time, the State Government taxes were Rs. 15.47 a litre on petrol and Rs. 10.23 a litre on diesel,” he pointed out. He said that after the reduction in taxes by the Union Government, the tax on petrol was Rs. 27.90 a litre, compared with Rs. 32.90 a litre earlier, and Rs. 21.80 a litre on diesel, compared with Rs. 31.80 a litre earlier. Compared with 2014 (when the basic price was roughly the same), the Union Government was still levying an additional tax of Rs. 18.42 on a litre of petrol and Rs. 18.23 on a litre of diesel, Mr. Rajan said. Tamil Nadu was levying a tax of Rs. 21.46 on a litre on petrol and Rs. 17.51 on a litre on diesel. The additional taxes of Rs. 9 a litre on petrol, which was reduced by Rs. 3 in August, and Rs. 7.25 a litre on diesel relative to the 2014 level were imposed by the previous AIADMK Government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-more-fuel-tax-cuts-thiaga-rajan/article37591188.ece

Replying to Mr. Bharathirajaa’s letter to him on the controversy, Dr. Anbumani pointed out that it was not a caste or a political issue. He alleged that the issue was about representation of the Vanniyar community as a villain in the film and the community being depicted in bad light continuously.

20 November 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Corporation mulls reopening Ganapathy waste transit station||To improve or rather restore the way it transported the waste collected from the streets, the Coimbatore Corporation is planning to reopen the transit station on Sathyamangalam Road, Ganapathy. The Corporation and waste management contractor, Coimbatore Integrated Waste Management Company Pvt. Ltd., were forced to shut down the transit station when the Highways Department took up construction of the flyover on Dr. Nanjappa Road – Sathyamangalam Road. The closure forced the contractor company to divert the vehicles it sent to Ganapathy to the transit stations in Peelamedu and Ukkadam. The contract company that was supposed to build and operate four transit stations as per the agreement it had signed with the Coimbatore Corporation – Ganapathy, Peelamedu, Ukkadam and Ondipudur – could build only three. It could not proceed with the construction at Ondipudur because of opposition from the area residents. At the time of closing the Ganapathy transit station, only three were operational. Closing the Ganapathy station burdened the contractor company as it had divert the 125 tonnes of waste a day to the other two transit stations. And, this resulted in the company operating the stations in two shifts of eight hours each. Sources familiar with the issue said even after the Highways Department completed the flyover construction, neither the Corporation nor the contractor company was able to reopen the transit station because of failure to reach an agreement on who would refinance the reconstruction. The contractor company’s argument was that the Corporation should bear the cost and the latter said it was the company’s responsibility. At the time of constructing the plant, the contractor company had invested 35% of the cost and the Corporation the rest. The contractor company also argued that as the Corporation had shut the plant to facilitate the government project, it should either ask the Highways Department to compensate the loss or own up the cost. As things went back and forth between the two, the delay in reopening the Ganapathy station continued and so did the burden on the Peelamedu and Ukkadam transit stations to process the additional waste. Meanwhile, the contractor company engaged a consultant to utilise the remaining space in the Ganapathy station to reopen the plant. The sources said the consultant had prepared a plan for Rs. 3.50 crore, which the contractor company had submitted to the Corporation for perusal. The Corporation officials said the civic body had written to the State government for concurrence to utilise the Central Finance Commission fund for rebuilding the plant. If the government were to give the concurrence and the Corporation were to reopen the plant, it would be able to save on the fuel used to transfer waste to the Peelamedu and Ukkadam stations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corporation-mulls-reopening-ganapathy-waste-transit-station/article37591223.ece

At a meeting held with textile industry players, the Minister warned the cotton bale traders against manipulation of prices or hoarding to make unfair profits. The manufacturing sector should not depend on Government support, as it is not healthy for the robust growth of the sector, he said. Farmers’ interests are being taken care of for the first time as they are now getting better prices for cotton, supported by very good base minimum support price (MSP). Pricing issue of cotton bales and yarn for the industry should not be allowed to impact the prices that farmers are getting, he added. Mr. Goyal said that the idea of short term super normal profits by a section of players in textile value chain was not sustainable. “No one should force the Government to intervene. Let free and fair market forces play out.” he added. The Minister further said that the value chain gets adversely impacted even if one section was weak. Aatma Nirbhar Bharat applies to every one in the value chain. All stake holders in the textile value chain need to support each other for long term sustainable growth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/resolve-cotton-pricing-issue-says-minister/article37591233.ece

The heavy rain that pounded the district all through Thursday led to heavy inflow into the Kelavarapalli, KRP and Paambaru dams. As a result, the reservoirs were opened to let out heavy discharge into the river. Over 30,000 cusecs of water was released from the various dams in the district, forcing the administration to issue warning and advisory for evacuation of people living along the banks.

20 November 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘Repeal of three farm laws is a big victory for farmers’||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement on repealing three farm laws was a big victory for the relentless protests of farmers in New Delhi, said State president of All India Agricultural Workers Union A. Lazar. However, the Prime Minister has only blamed the farmers for not understanding the “benefits” of the law and contended that it was a failure on the part of his government to make them understand them. “He has not said that the demand of farmers was genuine,” Mr. Lazar said. Mr. Lazar said that the timing of the announcement only showed that the repeal of the laws was done not in the interest of farmers but after the recent by-poll debacle in five States, farmers’ announcement of intensifying protest to mark the completion of one year of their agitation and the fear of defeat in the upcoming Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. On the comment by the AIADMK coordinator O. Panneerselvam that the Prime Minister has proved that he was a friend of the farmers by declaring withdrawal of the controversial laws, Mr. Lazar said that it was the AIADMK that had supported the three laws strongly. The party was claiming that the laws will give freedom to farmers to sell their produce to anyone in any part of the country and give them the power to fix the price for their goods. Students Federation of India members distributed sweets to celebrate the victory of farmers on the issue here on Friday. Tirunelveli Puthiya Thamizhagam (PT) president K. Krishnasamy has welcomed the withdrawal of farm laws by the Union Government. Speaking to reporters here on Friday, Dr. Krishnasamy said the repeal of the farm laws was a welcome move as PT was against enacting any law that would help corporates. Similarly, the Union Government should give up selling public sector undertakings to private companies. Coming down heavily on the Government for not giving cash along with ‘Pongal Gift’, which was given by the previous AIADMK government, the PT chief said each family cardholder should be given anywhere between Rs. 2,500 and Rs. 4,000 for celebrating Pongal. He said the State, which should present a ‘white paper’ on the temple properties, should retrieve all properties under encroachment and appoint a retired judge to monitor the melting of 5 lakh tonnes of gold with the temples.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/repeal-of-three-farm-laws-is-a-big-victory-for-farmers/article37591541.ece
20 November 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||High Court sets aside transfer orders of five prison personnel||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has quashed the transfer orders of five prison personnel of the Palayamkottai Central Prison. The transfer orders were passed without following the principles of natural justice, the court said. The court was hearing the petitions filed by five prison personnel who challenged their transfer from the Palayamkottai Central Prison to other central prisons. It was passed following the alleged murder of a remand prisoner, Muthu Mano inside the Palayamkottai Central Prison. The petitioners said that they were not on duty at the time of the incident. The prison personnel on duty at the time of the incident were suspended and accused prisoners were arrested. By no means the petitioners were responsible for the incident, they said. They said the transfer orders were passed without affording them any opportunity of hearing. The State submitted that the transfer orders were passed on administrative grounds and the same cannot be questioned by the employee. Palayamkottai Central Prison was a caste sensitive place and the prisoners were segregated and lodged in separate cells. Therefore, in order to avoid more complications, for the security purposes and to maintain a peaceful atmosphere, the transfer orders were passed, the State said. Justice D. Krishnakumar took note of the fact that the transfer order was based on a discreet enquiry report on the incident that took place on April 22. The transfer orders were passed in June and July. The court said that transfers made after preliminary enquiry should be followed by a detailed investigation and disciplinary action instituted on allegations finally found to be sustained. The court said that the transfer orders were passed in violation of principles of natural justice. The court set aside the transfer orders of the five prison personnel and allowed the petitions filed by them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-sets-aside-transfer-orders-of-five-prison-personnel/article37591538.ece

Fortune Pandiyan Hotel readied itself for the festival season with a cake-mixing ceremony on Friday. The patrons and the chefs poured cashew nuts, dates, candied orange peel, cherry, dry ginger chips, raisins, sultanas and spices into the cake mix, along with bottles of wine, rum, brandy and other spirits.

20 November 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘Address special needs of ‘mentally ill’ remand prisoners’||Time has come to conduct awareness programmes in police training academies and judicial academies to sensitise the officers concerned with regard to mental health issues, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has observed. Coming across a case where a prisoner was suffering from bipolar disorder, Justice G. R. Swaminathan observed that it is time the State revised the protocol regarding medical examination of the arrestees. The proforma for health screening of prisoners must contain a specific column as regards the mental well-being of the arrestee. The column cannot be filled up after posing formal questions to the arrestee. The duty doctor must observe independently and gather the inputs. Section 20 (1) of the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017, states that every person with mental illness should have a right to live with dignity and the expression ‘every person’ would obviously include an arrestee / remand prisoner too, the judge said. Sections 100 to 105 of the Act spells out duties of police officers and magistrates in respect of persons with mental illness. They are meant to be invoked in favour of mentally ill prisoners. The judge said mental wellness of the arrestee should be noted. If he or she is found to be mentally ill, the provisions of the Mental Healthcare Act will automatically get attracted. The police, duty doctor and judicial officer have a positive obligation to perform. If they find indications of mental illness, the statutory procedure must be adopted.   The court was hearing the petition filed by a woman who sought a direction to consider her representation to shift her husband from Thoothukudi Government Hospital to Tirunelveli GH. The petitioner’s husband was suffering from bipolar disorder. He was arrested and remanded in judicial custody following the death of a man who got loan from him and two others. Taking into account the fact that the woman’s husband had already received treatment in Tirunelveli, the judge permitted the prisoner to be transferred to Tirunelveli GH for better treatment. The judge, however, made it clear that the scope of the petition was confined to upholding the rights of the arrestee having special needs. It has absolutely no bearing on the investigation and that will proceed in accordance with law.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/address-special-needs-of-mentally-ill-remand-prisoners/article37591695.ece

20 November 2021||Nagercoil,TAMIL NADU||A piece of Travancore’s history lies in Suchindram||A 292-year-old piece of history of erstwhile Travancore has been lying in a corner of a house in Suchindram in Kanniyakumari district. The rectangular stone slab used as a bed by Ramayyan Dalava, the Dewan of Travancore, after destroying the houses of Yogakkar, the administrators of the Suchindram Thanumalayaswamy temple, is still preserved in the house known as Thekkuman Madam. Late historian K.K. Pillai, the author of the monograph, The Suchindram Temple, had recorded that the incident took place in 1729. The stone is five feet long and three feet wide. “Our ancestors preserved it inside our ancient house before shifting it to the southern region of the present house around 70 years ago,” said Pradeep Neelakantaru, the scion of the Thekkumun Madam family. According to K. K. Pillai, the desire of Marthanda Varma, the architect of modern Travancore, to weaken the excessive power of the Yogakkar of the great temple coupled with his eagerness to suppress corruption rampant among them and to enhance the revenue of the government had resulted in the confrontation. The occasion had come when the King was camping in Krishnankoil. He had conveyed his intention of visiting the temple that night to Uranmaikkar (Yogakkar). But they had conducted the pooja earlier than the regular timings and closed the temple’s door before the arrival of Marthanda Varma. A. K. Perumal, the author of a book on the temple in Tamil, said Marthanda Varma became furious after hearing the news and ordered demolition of the houses of Yogakkar before noon the next day. Ramayyan Dalava, who was commissioned with the task, set out the next morning with his troops. “But the Uranmaikkar escaped before the arrival of the royal forces. Ramayyan Dalava and the troops demolished the houses of all Yogakkars, except the Thekkumun Madam,” Mr Perumal said. The Thekkumun Madam family had left behind an old woman. K. K. Pillai had explained the popular version of the incident corroborated by the petition of the Thekkumun Potri to the King. “Tired after their exertions, Ramayyan and his men finally reached Thekkumun Madam. The woman, however, was all kindness and solicitude for the party, and offered them food, which they readily partook. Reluctant to harm the house that afforded hospitality, Ramayyan spared the Thekkuman Madam,” K. K. Pillai had said. Making a special reference to the stone slab, K. K. Pillai had recorded that “It is believed that Ramayyan Dalava had stretched himself on this slab, after partaking of the gruel (kanji) which was offered by the lady.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-piece-of-travancores-history-lies-in-suchindram/article37591302.ece

20 November 2021||Salem/Chennai/Thoothukudi,TAMIL NADU||‘Withdrawal of Central farm laws a victory for ryots’||Political leaders cutting across party lines have welcomed the Centre’s announcement of the withdrawal of three contentious farm laws. Agriculture Minister M.R.K. Panneerselvam said the move was a victory for farmers’ unity. He said Chief Minister M.K. Stalin was the first to oppose the farm laws, and had passed a resolution against them in the Assembly. As promised in the DMK’s election manifesto, a separate Budget for agriculture was tabled and, now, the farm laws had been withdrawn, he said. [The DMK had promised to fight for the repeal of the three laws]. Asked whether the withdrawal of the laws would work in favour of the BJP, Mr. Panneerselvam said they were withdrawn as the BJP had suffered severe losses in byelections and feared further losses in the upcoming Assembly elections in certain States. Minister for Municipal Administration K.N. Nehru said the laws could have been withdrawn long ago, and the decision was a boon to farmers. ‘PM a friend of farmers’ AIADMK coordinator O. Panneerselvam on Friday described Narendra Modi as a “friend of farmers” after the Prime Minister announced the repeal of the three farm laws. In a statement, he said the decision was a reflection of Mr. Modi’s “generosity and concern” towards farmers. “On behalf of the AIADMK, I thank him,” he said. V.K. Sasikala, former interim general secretary of the AIADMK, welcomed the Prime Minister’s decision to form a committee comprising representatives of both the Union and State Governments to look into the issues of agriculture. In a statement, she appealed to the Union Government to pay compensation to the kin of those who died in the year-long agitations against the farm laws and withdraw the cases filed against the agitators. In a series of tweets, T.T.V. Dhinakaran, general secretary of the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam, termed the announcement a matter of relief and said those who were in power should make it a point to consult the farmers fully while formulating agriculture policies. Dravidar Kazhagam president K. Veeramani said the repeal was a victory for farmers and people’s rule. In a Twitter post, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi leader Thol. Thirumavalavan said the decision had come late and the Government should take responsibility for the damage caused during the protests. “The government should give compensation to the families of farmers who lost their lives and jobs to a member of each affected family.” Pattali Makkal Katchi founder S. Ramadoss wrote on Twitter that it was a huge victory for farmers. He also demanded that the Godavari-Cauvery link project be expedited and the infrastructure for farm produce fortified. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement was a huge and unprecedented victory for agriculturists, democracy and the entire nation, DMK MP Kanimozhi has said. Speaking to reporters on Friday, after taking part in Cooperative Week celebrations, Ms. Kanimozhi said the DMK and its allies, even before returning to power this May, had extended unstinted support to farmers protesting against the controversial laws, which had been enacted “with the prime objective of helping the corporates, while decimating the growers”. Hence, on coming to power, the DMK had passed a resolution against the laws in the Assembly, she said. Mr. Modi, who was unable to face stiff resistance from the farmers, was compelled to withdraw the farm legislation, and this is a huge and unprecedented victory for the farming community, democracy and India, she said. TNCC president K.S. Alagiri said the Prime Minister’s announcement was a result of the losses faced by the BJP in the recent bypolls, [fear of facing] the upcoming elections to the five State Assemblies and the anger among farmers, following the Lakhimpur Kheri incident. “This is an absolutely opportunistic move on the part of the Prime Minister. He has acted with other intentions in mind,” Mr. Alagiri said. He congratulated farmers’ unions that have been protesting against the laws, and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi, who has been supporting the farmers, for the victory. In a statement, Naam Tamilar Katchi chief coordinator Seeman termed it a historic victory. DMDK president Vijayakant demanded that the families of the farmers who died during the protests be granted solatium. Tamizhaga Vazhvurimai Katchi leader T. Velmurugan also welcomed the decision. Meanwhile, Desiya Thennindia Nadigal Inaippu Vivasayigal Sangam president P. Ayyakannu, who had been on a sit-in relay fast with his supporters at his house for the past 39 days to press for the repeal of the farm laws and other demands, withdrew his stir.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/withdrawal-of-central-farm-laws-a-victory-for-ryots/article37591184.ece

20 November 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||Delta farmers happy, but not all||The Central government’s decision to withdraw the three new farm laws has evoked mixed reactions from the farming community in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts. While the group of Farmers Associations which were up the ante right from day one have expressed their happiness by bursting crackers and distributing sweets to the public at different parts of Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts, the progressive farmers in these two districts who nourished the hope of witnessing a turnaround in their fortune once again preferred to remain receptive as they used to in the past. The Central government’s decision was viewed as a ‘victory for farmers’ who have opposed the three Farm Laws by the office-bearers and members of various Farmers’ Associations such as the Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangams affiliated to the Communist Party of India and the Communist Party of India (Marxists), the Coordination Committee of All Farmers Associations in Tamil Nadu and the Thamizhaga Cauvery Farmers Welfare Protection Association. On the other hand, some of the progressive farmers aspiring for positive changes in the agriculture sector but prefer to avoid getting identified as the espousers of certain political ideologies have as usual preferred to remain receptive of the current development also, hoping that the scenes would change in future.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/delta-farmers-happy-but-not-all/article37591288.ece
20 November 2021||Thoothukudi,TAMIL NADU||Algal bloom affects coral reef ecosystem in Gulf of Mannar||On October 6, 2008 fishermen from Keezhakarai coast of Gulf of Mannar (GoM) were panic stricken as they noticed a large number of dead fish and other organisms washed ashore. The surface seawater had turned greenish. Researchers ascertained that the green tide was the blooming of Noctiluca scintillans , which is non-toxic. However, corals were found to be affected by the asphyxiation caused by the N. scintillans bloom in Valai and Thalaiyari islands that triggered the massive death of marine organisms. Proliferation or outbreak of N. scintillans , a free-living marine dinoflagellate phytoplankton, results in millions of cells per litre of water, which is known as algal bloom. Massive fish mortality is often associated with algal blooms due to depletion of dissolved oxygen level caused by N. scintillans respiration. Further, the dense cells of N. scintillans can damage fish gills. During a survey conducted recently by Suganthi Devadasan Marine Research Institute (SDMRI), fishermen said algal blooming was frequent in GoM, almost every year during October, but with very little density and with no related impact. However, after 10 years, in 2019 blooming again caused large-scale fish death and coral mortality and it recurred in 2020 and 2021. All the witnessed blooms of N. scintillans happened between southwest and northeast monsoons. The Noctiluca bloom in 2021 has severely affected a larger area than before between Rameswaram and Punnakayal in Thoothukudi district in GoM and fish mortality is significantly higher. Coral mortality has been observed in Krusadai, Manoliputti and Manoli islands of Mandapam region by the Reef Research Team of Suganthi Devadason Marine Research Institute (SDMRI-RRT) in association with the Forest Department through rapid underwater monitoring during October and November this year. “A total of 102 colonies in Krusadai (within 500 sq.m area), 211 colonies in Manoliputti (within 270 sq.m area) and 422 colonies in Manoli Island (within 1 sq.km area) were found dead due to the bloom. The branching coral, Acropora is the worst affected coral genus contributing more than 95% of the total dead corals,” said J.K. Patterson Edward, Director, SDMRI.  “In general, factors like well-mixed and nutrient-rich waters, seasonal circulation, currents and nutrient enrichment of coastal waters by human activities influence the occurrence and intensity of algal blooms. Climate change has been reported to be the prime reason for such blooms and, predictably, blooms will recur in future as climate change worsens,” Dr. Patterson Edward observed. Coral cover in GoM has already suffered significant decline mainly due to the coral mortality caused by the bleaching events in 2010 (10% mortality) and 2016 (16% mortality). The annual blooming phenomena inflicts a loss not merely to corals but also to coral-associated biodiversity particularly the fishery resources and ultimately to the livelihood of the dependent people. Focused research and monitoring will help to develop mitigation protocols for managing the reef areas from this emerging annual threat to corals and associated biodiversity, he noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/algal-bloom-affects-coral-reef-ecosystem-in-gulf-of-mannar/article37591309.ece

Senthil Raj and MP Kanimozhi on Friday. The burial urn contained human skull, bones and mud pots. When the Archaeological Survey of India team, led by Regional Director Arun Raj, excavated the ancient civilization sites of Aditchanallur recently as they resumed the excavation exercise, a burial urn was excavated in addition to the 12 burial urns recovered earlier on several occasions. The recently recovered burial urn was found near the lime-plastered floor. Hence, the Archaeological Survey of India experts had expected that the urn might contain some interesting artefacts. The urn contained a human skull and leg bones and also small mud pots, which may have been used to store paddy. The Archaeological Survey of India experts also anticipate that weapons could have been buried near the spot where the burial urn was excavated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/burial-urn-containing-bones-unearthed/article37591307.ece
20 November 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Let children open up and share details of daily life: Minister||It is important to create a safe environment for children to open up and share details of their daily lives, School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi said. The person the child confides in - be it a parent, teacher or any non-teaching staff - must listen to them carefully and not dismiss them, he said. The Minister inaugurated a workshop for teachers on child protection at the Bishop Heber Higher Secondary School on the occasion of World Day for Prevention of Child Abuse. Addressing the gathering of over 300 teachers, the Minister said that it was important to create awareness, especially among girl children. Many need to be exposed to the outside world and understand concepts such as good and bad touch, he said. A 10-point agenda, including training for teachers, students and parents on the importance of child protection, establishing schools as a safe space for children and school management accepting the responsibility, awareness of the ‘14417’ toll-free helpline for students, was announced by the Minister. State Project Director (Samagra Shiksha) R. Sudhan insisted that prevention of child abuse was an ongoing process and cannot be celebrated on a single day. He urged the teachers attending the programme to take up the role of ‘master trainers’ and impart lessons learnt through such workshops to parents, non-teaching staff and other stakeholders. Mr. Sudhan said that awareness of child rights and laws protecting them needs to be created. Sensitisation is important, he said. Nancy Veronica Thomas of Tulir, a not-for-profit organisation working for child protection conducted the workshop. It would be working along with the Department for this purpose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/let-children-open-up-and-share-details-of-daily-life-minister/article37591279.ece
20 November 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Glasgow Climate Pact spells more trouble for BHEL ancillaries||India’s intervention to water down the language of the Glasgow Climate Pact with respect to ‘phasing down’ coal may not contribute to stem decline of thermal power equipment manufacturers, lament anxious proprietors of the drastically declining number of ancillary industries that had been highly dependent on public sector major BHEL for survival. Coal has been referred to as the dirtiest fossil fuel by the International Energy Agency, which advocates a rapid phaseout for the world to staying within 1.5C of global heating. This implies that at least 40% of the world’s existing 8,500 coal-fired power plants must be closed by 2030 and no new ones built, much to the detriment of the coal-fired power plants and power equipment manufacturers in India. Though it was at India’s insistence that ‘phasing out’ coal was replaced with ‘phasing down.’ the ancillary industries are doubtful about the future of the thermal power sector, and are keen on BHEL’s diversification for sustenance in the long run. Proprietors of ancillary industries in Tiruchi region say there was much anticipation on some forward movement in the move made by BHEL-Tiruchi to manufacture electric buses. The Container Corporation (CONCOR), a railways subsidiary, has placed work order for manufacture of 2,000 containers with BHEL and Braithwaite and Co. Likewise, the BHEL must also make the most of the proposed Defence Industrial Corridor in Tamil Nadu, with Tiruchi as one of the five nodes, a promoter of an ancillary unit emphasised. According to BHEL sources, the Corporation is hopeful of progress in the move by the Central government to renovate ageing thermal power stations. The Central Electrical Authority came out with guidelines last year for renovation and modernisation / life extension works of coal / lignite-based thermal stations. The ancillary industries have not entirely lost hopes for survival since the country cannot entirely depend on renewable power for sustaining the economy for at least a decade. “For the ancillary industries, the challenges have grown bigger, due to the rapid rise in the cost of inputs and labour. The necessity to quote low for conversion works due to the competition has pushed many units into the red,” S. Sampath, Director, Velmurugan Industries, and former Chairman, CII, Tiruchi Zone, said. “But then, the onus is on the units to devise ways for survival through cost-cutting and disruptive approaches. Modernisation and innovation ought to be the watchwords. Only those focussing on efficiency on employees, material control, and bottom line financial management will be able to survive. Modernisation does not necessarily mean investing more,” Mr. Sampath said.  There is much anticipation on some forward movement in the move made by BHEL-Tiruchi to manufacture electric buses||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/glasgow-climate-pact-spells-more-trouble-for-bhel-ancillaries/article37591691.ece
20 November 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||TIDCO stake infuses vibrancy into TREAT cluster||Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO) has picked up equity to the value of Rs. 10 crore in the Trichy Engineering and Technology Cluster (TREAT), much to the relief of member- companies battling a slowdown in economy. TIDCO’s equity in the current context of financial depression has provided the much-needed leeway for TREAT to take off and enable member companies to derive the advantage of economy of scale while executing orders for BHEL, Rajappa Rajkumar, former Director of TREAT and president of BHEL Small Industries Association, pointed out As many as 85 companies are associated directly and indirectly with TREAT for carrying out rolling, machining and other job works on a large scale at the common facility centre operated by the cluster. If not for the recession, the cluster initiated at an investment of Rs. 103 crore during 2012 through a special purpose vehicle would have been fully completed by now. The Central government had released Rs. 56 crore grant for the project and the promoters got a bank loan of Rs. 30 crore. So far, 90% of the works have been completed. A section-25 company registered under the Companies Act, 1956, TREAT has now positioned itself to receive orders directly from BHEL and other corporate entities, including TATA and Jindal, Mr. Rajappa Rajkumar said. The Railways and ISRO have also approached TREAT. The ancillary industries are expecting the BHEL to scale up the partnership by venturing into manufacture of containers, he said. “Now that TIDCO has bailed out TREAT from financial burden, the cluster will add value to the member companies by charging lesser for conversion works,” he said. The situation, nevertheless, remains challenging for survival of ancillary units due to the escalation in the cost of raw materials. For about 25 ancillary companies of BHEL, the TREAT is collectively liaising such that the individual industries do not suffer due to under-cutting of rates, Mr. Rajappa Rajkumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tidco-stake-infuses-vibrancy-into-treat-cluster/article37591693.ece

20 November 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Importance of sanitation and hygiene stressed among residents of village||The Indian Institute of Human Settlements (IIHS) observed World Toilet Day by organising an awareness programme on the importance of sanitation and hygiene at Indira Nagar in Edamalaipatti Pudur where open defecation continues to be prevalent. A tenement with over 146 houses, at least 130 of them did not have a toilet in the house and depended on a toilet complex. A total of 16 of them constructed toilets under the Swachh Bharat Mission. However only six are functional. The people defecate along a pond nearby, as the community toilets are over a kilometre away. “The women are unable to go to the toilet at night and therefore go to the open space,” they said. As part of the programme, the residents were asked to map their homes and the availability of functional toilets in an exercise called participatory mapping. “It is important that we inculcate the need for toilets. It is from these realisations that the people will start to use them,” Sugantha Priscilla, senior specialist, Social Development, IIHS, said. Drawing, slogan writing and other programmes were organised. Meanwhile, Gramalaya in association with Reckitt and Jagran Pahel inaugurated Harpic World Toilet College, a training and capacity building centre for sanitation workers. A total of 45 sanitation workers of Tiruchi Corporation took part in the one-day programme. Gramalaya plans to train 3,000 sanitation workers in three cities - Tiruchi, Kochi and Kurnool by March.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/importance-of-sanitation-and-hygiene-stressed-among-residents-of-village/article37591290.ece

The farmers had planned to go on a 46-day relay fast from October 12 but had to confine themselves to Mr. Ayyakannu’s house in the city after being denied permission for the protest in public. Welcoming the Prime Minister’s decision, Mr.Ayyakannu hoped that the legislative process to repeal the laws would be taken up on the very first day of the winter session of Parliament . “We accept and welcome the decision. The Prime Minister should also ensure doubling of the profit to farmers for agriculture produce and allot adequate funds for the execution of Godavari-Cauvery river link scheme,” Mr. Ayyakannu said.

20 November 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Teachers hail govt.’s decisive stand on exams||Teachers of higher educational institutions have heaved a sigh of relief over the agreement reached between the State government and students’ organisations over conduct of the odd semester exam in offline mode. Teachers said the government’s decisive stand for conduct of exam in offline mode was inevitable since there was a huge problem of students becoming unemployable in the absence of classroom and practical sessions. The teachers find themselves necessitated to teach students concepts from the scratch. Spending substantial time only to teach school content at the higher educational level does not make sense, they point out. “The current batch of second year students has not yet gone through an offline exam. Having undergone regular classes for a few months so far, the demand of students for persisting with the system of online exam defies logic,” a senior teacher of an engineering college said. “Having enjoyed the comfort of taking exams from home for one-and-a-half years, the students seem to lose track of the fact that their future will be at stake if they fail to assimilate the theory portions, and develop their skills through practical sessions,” another teacher said. Recruiters have also started carrying out the selection of candidates in offline mode. The students have to necessarily realise the gravity of the situation and get ready for offline exams in their own interests, he said. College heads, on their part, are a relieved lot, saying there is substantial time for the teachers to complete the portions and conduct model tests, citing the government’s announcement on Friday that the odd semester exam for arts and science colleges, polytechnics, engineering colleges and other higher educational institutions will be conducted from January 20, 2022.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/teachers-hail-govts-decisive-stand-on-exams/article37591285.ece

Vishnu has said the district administration had roped in a Thoothukudi-based exporter to export the banana fibre products being made by the self-help group women. According to Mr. Vishnu, the district administration had established centres at Suththamalli and Kodaganallur for making a range of products from banana fibre, which was hitherto getting wasted in the field after the harvest of banana. A total of seventy women self-help group members from Maanur and Paappaakudi panchayat unions were making banana fibre products after undergoing comprehensive training. Besides ensuring additional revenue for banana growers as they sell the banana fibre, this venture had provided alternative livelihood for the rural poor women, who were once beedi rollers. The finished products would be exported through Thoothukudi-based Ramesh Flowers. The Collector also inquired with the SHG women about the training they underwent, uninterrupted supply of banana fibres, productivity and their income now and then. The women replied that after being trained, they had gained confidence that they could increase their income substantially. Joint Director of Agriculture Gajendra Pandian accompanied the Collector, who also inspected the overflowing Maanur Periyakulam, one of the major irrigation tanks of the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/banana-fibre-products-made-by-shg-members-ready-for-export/article37591699.ece

It was the last day of the 10-day Karthigai Deepam festival of the Sri Arunachaleswarar temple. The day began with puja, followed by the lighting of ‘Bharani Deepam’ at the temple at 4 a.m. With the Madras High Court having directed the State Government to allow 20,000 devotees, the flow of visitors had been steady since the morning. Vehicles were stopped two km away from the temple. Apart from nine temporary bus terminus, 10 police booths and 13 watch towers were opened. “Around 5,000 policemen were deployed,” Superintendent of Police A. Pavan Kumar Reddy told The Hindu . According to officials of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department, the Maha Deepam is lit atop the 2,668-foot Annamalai hill. The cauldron is taken to the hill top through a seven-km route a day before the Maha Deepam. The cauldron is 10 feet high and five feet wide, carried on poles by 65 persons, mostly fishermen. It is filled with 750 kg of pure ghee. A wick measuring more than 300 metres and made with a special cotton cloth is inserted in the cauldron. The Deepam is lit with fire from 10 kg of camphor. It is visible in a radius of 35 km. In the next 10 days, temple officials will ensure that the Maha Deepam is lit. “Every morning, the team removes the ash from the flame pit and lights the Deepam,” said M. Thyagarajan, stores manager of the temple.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/maha-deepam-brings-life-back-to-tiruvannamalai/article37591186.ece
20 November 2021||TIRUVARUR,TAMIL NADU||Flood-resistant ‘Maapillai Samba’ grows well||An attempt to raise the traditional paddy variety - ‘Maapillai Samba’ - on a barren tankbed at Rishiyur in Needamangalam taluk by a farmer has thrown up interesting results. The tank bed was tilled and the ‘Maapillai Samba’ nursery was transplanted during the third week of October. As the nursery started growing, the waterbody started filling up with rainwater thanks to incessant rains. However, the farm managers were happy as the green leaves of the 25-day crop stood above the water indicating that the crop has withstood the floods. The farm management led by Senthil Umaiyarasi of RKM Organic Farms, Rishiyur, decided to cultivate the flood-resistant traditional variety ‘Maapillai Samba’ in the barren tank which was used as a groundwater recharging facility till recently. For the last 10 years, the tank remained empty for most part of the year. Prior to that, this tank served as a source for irrigation, she added. The traditional paddy variety nursery raised in the farm was transplanted on the tilled tankbed on October 22 and the crop started growing under the care of the farmworkers. Meanwhile, the tank started filling up with rainwater due to the recent rains. However, the growth of the crop seems to have not been affected despite the water level increasing over three to four feet at the tank as the green leaves of the crop remained over and above the water level, she said. Suitable for delta Stating that normally paddy crop would get lodged or perish if the one-month young crop remained in the water for more than three to four days, she claimed that in this case, the ‘Maapillai Samba’ withstood the nature’s fury and once again it had established that it was suitable for cultivation in flood-prone areas in the delta region.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/flood-resistant-maapillai-samba-grows-well/article37591287.ece

20 November 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||‘Steps to prevent delay in getting certificates’||Farmers’ grievances redressal day meetings that are usually marked with tense moments began with celebration in Virudhunagar Collectorate with farmers distributing sweets to all farmers and officials. The announcement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on repealing all the three controversial farm laws hours before the commencement of the meeting was the reason for the celebrations. “We used this opportunity to thank all those who supported us in our continuous protest against the farm laws,” said Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam leader, A. Vijayamurugan. When senior farmer, O. Narayanasamy, raised the issue of delay in getting sowing certificate from the village administrative officers, Collector J. Meghanath Reddy promised to send a circular to ease the process at the special patta-related camps being conducted on Wednesdays and Fridays. The Collector also promised to take efforts for expeditious disbursal of compensation under crop insurance scheme to the farmers who have been waiting for nearly one year. The Collector also assured free flow of supply of fertilizer in the district as 1,900 tonnes of fresh stocks had arrived and was being distributed through the primary agricultural cooperative societies. When Mr .Vijayamurugan raised the issue of wild boar menace in various taluks, the Collector said that efforts were being taken to check the crop damages caused by the wild animals. The affected farmers have been asked to send their applications seeking compensation for crop damage to the Department of Forests with a certificate of joint field inspection by officials from the Departments of Revenue, Agriculture and Horticulture, the Collector said. Farmers also raised the difficulties faced by cattle farmers in allowing ‘malai maadu’ (cattles) grazing along the western ghats after declaration of the forest areas in Virudhunagar district under Srivilliputtur Meghamalai Tiger Reserve.

20 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Rains drive veggie prices up; supply of greens impacted||Heavy rains, lashing the city and other parts of the State for over two weeks, have led to widespread crop damage, especially that of vegetables. This, in turn, has driven prices up. Tomatoes, carrots and capsicum have already breached the Rs. 100 mark per a kilo in the retail market, putting them out of reach for many families. Some varieties of coriander, too, are retailing at anywhere between Rs. 90-Rs. 100 a bunch. Other vegetables are also priced on the higher side, with citizens citing lack of supply in most shops. “There is no supply to the market. There is usually a dip in supply of vegetables and greens to the Bengaluru market in the winter, and prices shoot up. But this year the dip is more pronounced due to rains. While transport networks are disrupted, there is also crop damage,” said a senior procurement officer at a leading retail grocery chain in the city. Kolar, Chickballapur, Bengaluru Rural and Ramanagaram districts surrounding the city — a vegetable cultivation belt — have been hit by heavy rains for the past two weeks. Even districts like Kolar and Chickballapur that are usually drought prone are seeing heavy rains damaging tomato crop. “Anecdotally, we can say there is widespread crop damage. Add to this, even at such steep prices, the quality of most of the vegetables is not good. For instance, most of the onions available in the market are wet and smaller in size. Onions supplied from within the State are wet, and are also from the end of the season. But onions coming from Maharashtra are of a good quality,” said a senior onion trader in Yeshwanthpur APMC Yard. Relief only by new year? Though there might be some minor relief a few days after the rains stop, a reprieve from soaring prices may come to consumers only by the New Year, industry insiders predict. Tomatoes are a three-month crop and likewise most vegetables will take at least a month or two, for the farmers to overcome crop damage in this cycle, sow and harvest the next crop. This means, it will at least the new year before the present shortage in supply is overcome and the prices stabilise, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rains-drive-veggie-prices-up-supply-of-greens-impacted/article37591141.ece
20 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||ACB launches massive raid on BDA||Nearly a hundred sleuths from Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) launched a surprise and extensive raid on Bengaluru Development Authority (BDA) at its headoffice in the city on Friday afternoon. The raids have covered most departments of the Authority, including wings of all four Deputy Secretaries, who are key to running of the organisation as well as land acquisition and engineering departments. ACB officials have taken control of most of the offices, especially the record rooms and archives. Officers were not allowed to go out, sources said. “We have taken a search warrant from the court for one week. We will extend it if need be,” a senior ACB officer told The Hindu , indicating that the raid would be extensive and is expected to go on for at least a week. The raids come close on the heels of Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, who also holds charge of Bengaluru Development, criticising the BDA at a recent review meeting. The CM is also under fire over the alleged ‘bitcoin scam’ from the Opposition, who have claimed that the scam was “covered up” when he was Home Minister in B.S. Yediyurappa’s cabinet. Incidentally, BDA Chairman and BJP MLA S.R. Vishwanath has himself held multiple press conferences over the last few months alleging widespread corruption in the Authority. The raids, led by three Superintendent of Police rank officers, were based on information of “widespread and large-scale irregularities” in the BDA, said the ACB in a press release. Sources in ACB said that the agency had received multiple complaints alleging corruption in the Authority and the raids were not linked to any one complaint in particular, but were “all encompassing” and would review all records, cross checking documents on a host of complaints and tip-offs. “We have credible information on irregularities and corruption in allocation of alternate sites, developed land as part of the compensation for land losers and in approvals given to layouts. We have also uncovered a layout where most of the sites seem to be allotted to BDA employees themselves,” said a senior ACB sleuth leading the raids. He alleged that BDA officers were trying to evade cops on specific files saying that they were missing. M.B. Rajesh Gowda, Commissioner, BDA, described the raids as a “routine affair” and said the Authority will ensure full cooperation to ACB. “ACB will be investigating specific cases based on complaints or tip-offs. Let them carry out their probe. But as an organisation, BDA is in need of reform. It is high time we digitise all record keeping and not only fill vacancies, but also augment the strength of the organisation,” he said.

20 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||November rainfall highest in the past six years||Citizens, on Friday, got a respite from the heavy rains that have been lashing Bengaluru over the past few days. From November 1 to 18, the city received 255.9 mm of rain, the highest in the past six years. The city last experienced such weather in November 2015 when it recorded 296.4 mm of rain. The average rainfall during November is around 50 mm, with the average maximum and minimum temperatures of 27 degrees and 18 degrees Celsius. This month, there has been a –5 degree departure in the maximum temperature. Taking no chances, the Department of Public Instruction, on Friday, directed all deputy directors in Karnataka to shift schools out of buildings that are in a dilapidated condition. Officials have been told to make local arrangements keeping in mind the safety of children. School managements have been asked to submit details about repair works needed for the school buildings. A yellow alert has been issued for Saturday. Over the weekend, the city can expect a few spells of rain/ thundershowers. House collapses A 58-year-old single-storey house on Milkman Street, near Lido Mall in Ulsoor, collapsed early Friday morning. BBMP officials said it was a mud and brick construction. The house was locked. Nearby buildings were unaffected. No casualties or injuries have been reported. Two two-wheelers that had been parked on the road were damaged, officials said. Civic Chief Gaurav Gupta, who visited the spot, said the BBMP had already issued a notice to the building owner, as the structure had been identified as weak during a survey,” he said. According to the rainfall data made available by the BBMP, six wards in Mahadevapura zone received the maximum rains on November 18. Hagadur ward received the maximum rainfall of 142 mm, followed by Varthur and Doddanekkundi (104 mm), HAL Airport (97.5 mm), K.R. Puram (86.5 mm) and Horamavu (84.5 mm).

20 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Vector-borne diseases see a reduction this year||Unusually heavy rains in November has prompted the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to step up its efforts to check the spread of vector-borne diseases. However, so far, Bengaluru has reported fewer cases of dengue and chikungunya this year compared to 2020, said BBMP Special Commissioner (Health) K.V. Trilokchandra. From January to December 2020, the city recorded 1,912 cases of dengue and 139 cases of chikungunya. This year (from January to November 19), there have been 1,119 cases of dengue and 55 of chikungunya cases. Nevertheless, the BBMP is not taking any chances. On Friday, a meeting was held to discuss the various measures that have been taken to check the spread of the diseases. Ravikumar from the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme instructed the civic officials to focus on source reduction. Most dengue and chikungunya cases are reported in the monsoon months, when the rains cause fresh water to stagnate. These vector-borne diseases are commonly transmitted by the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes that are known to breed in freshwater. Door-to-door survey Civic officials said that apart from regular ICE (information, communication and education) awareness drives, the BBMP has also taken up a door-to-door survey. During the survey, the health workers will check if anyone has symptoms of either chikungunya or dengue. Mr. Trilokchandra told The Hindu that priority is being given to source-reduction measures. “Since the mosquitoes transmitting the virus breed in freshwater, civic officials are ensuring that there are no water receptacles lying in the open. Citizens must also keep their surroundings clean to ensure there are no breeding sites for these mosquitoes,” he said and added that regular spraying is also taken up. Civic officials said that given the slew of measures in place to check the spread, they do not expect the number of cases of dengue and chikungunya to increase.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vector-borne-diseases-see-a-reduction-this-year/article37591146.ece
20 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘AI can digitise farm sector’||India will become a financial superpower if it uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to digitise its vast farm sector, said Prof. Klaus Schwab, founder of the World Economic Forum. In his virtual address at Bengaluru Tech Summit 2021 on Friday, Prof. Schwab said India had the technological capability and prowess to propel the agricultural sector into the digital world. “As the world is witnessing the fourth industrial revolution, accessibility of internet services and its speed will play a major role in it,” he said. However, he regretted that in India at least 50% of citizens do not have access to the internet. He called upon the Indian and Karnataka Governments to work on bridging this digital divide. Prof. Schwab said the World Economic Forum has been working with telecom companies to bring technologies and their businesses closer. Some 35 million new jobs are likely to be generated by 2025 as a result of this industrial revolution all over the world, adding that India should not let go of this opportunity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ai-can-digitise-farm-sector/article37591147.ece

20 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||A show of sensitivity to farmers’ demand: CM||Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai on Friday said repeal of farm laws was not a setback to the BJP but a mark of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s sensitivity to the demands of farmers. “The Prime Minister responded to farmers’ demand by repealing the laws. Farmers’ outfits across the country have welcomed Mr. Modi’s decision. The decision shows the Prime Minister’s sensitivity to farmers’ demands,” the Chief Minister said. “The Congress claimed victory for repeal of the laws. But, the farmers’ organisations had not involved political parties in their protest. Farmers organisations have not even shared the dais with political parties,” he said. The Chief Ministerrejected the claim that the Government bowed to the yearlong protest and said the three laws were part of the liberalisation and globalisation process started in 1991–92. Thelaws were formulated in tune with the previous United Progressive Alliance Government’s agreement with the World Trade Organization, he added. In reply to a question, he denied that repeal of farms laws were connected to the Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and other States. ‘On behalf of farmers’ The former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa congratulated Mr. Modi “on behalf of farmers of the country” for repealing the three farm laws. “The farmers had been protesting against the three controversial laws for the past 15 months. The Government, instead of making it a prestige issue, has taken this decision in the interest of farmers,” he said. To a question on the death of nearly 700 farmers during the yearlong agitation, he said he mourned the death of every farmer and added “the decision [to repeal the laws] may have been late, but was a good decision”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/a-show-of-sensitivity-to-farmers-demand-cm/article37591154.ece
20 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Modi had to bow to democratic resistance’||Opposition Congress and JD(S) have hailed the announcement on the repeal of the three farm laws by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a victory of the farmers’ democratic struggle. They also said that it comes in the backdrop of the upcoming Assembly elections. Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Siddaramaiah termed the repeal a victory for democracy and demanded Rs. 25 lakh compensation to the families of the farmers who lost their lives during the yearlong protest. The former Chief Minister tweeted that “it is time to give justice to the farmers who were martyred during the struggle” and urged the Prime Minister to announce Rs. 25 lakh to the deceased farmers. “Farmers have finally got their independence,” he said. JD(S) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy said the rollback had come in the light of elections to five State Assemblies. “Suspicions in the mind of farmers still need to be addressed. Ultimately, the Union Government has yielded to the fight of the farmers. While the Union Government brought in the laws without discussions, it has withdrawn the laws without discussions,”he told reporters here on Friday. “If the Government was committed to the welfare of farmers, it should have discussed the Bills beforehand.” Suggesting that there should be no politics over the withdrawal of laws, Mr. Kumaraswamy said the Union Government would have been spared the embarrassment if the laws were withdrawn soon after protests broke out in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. “There is confidence deficit in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision, which has been made after considering elections.” Former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda tweeted, “My salute to all the farmers who put up democratic resistance against the laws. Debate and discussion is key in a parliamentary set up.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/modi-had-to-bow-to-democratic-resistance/article37591155.ece

20 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State to wait for Centre’s suggestion||Karnataka, which amended the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act in 2020, based on the Central Government’s suggestion, will take a decision on repealing the Act after consultation with the Centre, said Minister for Law and Parliamentary Affairs J.C. Madhuswamy. The Minister said the APMC Act was enacted based on the Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2017, of the Centre. The State would not take immediate decision. The Government would wait for the Centre’s directive/suggestion on repealing the Act, the Minister told The Hindu on Friday. The APMC Act removed restrictions on the sale of farm produce and allowed private players to purchase agricultural commodities from farmers. The Congress and farmers’ organisations termed the Act “anti-farmer”, alleging that it was aimed at clipping the powers of the APMCs and permitting the entry of MNCs in the agricultural marketing sector. However, the Government ruled out repealing the amendments made to the Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1961, in 2020, on the grounds that they were not related to any of the three farm laws that are to be repealed by the Centre. The amended Land Reforms Act removed income restrictions on purchases of agricultural land and permitted non-agriculturists to purchase the land. The Opposition Congress has said that the newly amended Act would sound the “death knell” for food security and small and marginal farmers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-to-wait-for-centres-suggestion/article37591159.ece

20 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BWSSB told to settle water bill dispute with BBMP||Criticising the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board for giving rise to an avoidable dispute, the High Court of Karnataka has directed the Board and the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike to resolve the 25-year-old dispute over payment of arrears of water bill of over Rs. 2 crore amongst themselves without dragging the firm maintaining BBMP’s Jayanagar swimming pool. The court, while noticing that many of the officers responsible for such a situation would have retired by now, restrained itself from ordering disciplinary inquiry against officers of the Board to recover the due from them for having let the amount of arrears grow to mountainous proportions over the last 25 years. Justice M. Nagaprasanna passed the order on a petition filed by M/s PM Swimming Centre questioning the demand made by the BWSSB to pay the arrears of water bill. The court noticed that the arrears of amount demanded by the BWSSB was prior to the petitioner-firm taking over the pool in 1996 for maintenance, and that the firm had not used water from the BWSSB as it had a different source for water. BWSSB had allowed the alleged arrears to grow over 25 years without taking action at the earliest when the law permits the Board to disconnect sewage connection if bill not paid within 15 days of issuance, the Bench said, while noting that BWSSB resorted to disconnection of sewerage connection only recently.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bwssb-told-to-settle-water-bill-dispute-with-bbmp/article37591151.ece

20 November 2021||Bengaluru/Mysuru/Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Farmers to now shift focus to APMC, land reforms laws||Farmers in Karnataka, who were protesting against the three contentious farm laws which are set to be withdrawn as per an announcement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, will now seek repeal of amendments made by the Karnataka Government to the land reforms Act and the APMC Act. While the nationwide agitation focused on repealing of the three contentious farm laws, farmers in Karnataka were also unhappy with two laws passed by the BJP Government. Protests against the Karnataka Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (Regulation and Development) (Amendment) Act, 2020, and the Karnataka Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 2020, had got dovetailed with the agitation against the Central laws. Modifications to the Karnataka Land Reforms Act enable anyone to purchase agricultural land for use for non-agricultural purpose. Earlier, there were stringent restrictions with only farmers allowed to purchase agricultural land. Amendments to the APMC Act allowed private players to purchase agricultural commodities from farmers. Farmers were opposed to the amendment on the ground that it would pave the way for entry of MNCs and corporates who would dictate both the cropping pattern and prices. Samyukta Horata – Karnataka, a coalition of farmers and various organisations, in a statement on Friday demanded that the Government of Karnataka should also walk in the footsteps of Mr. Modi. “If Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai does not make an announcement soon, we will be forced to launch an agitation in the State,” a statement by Samyukta Horata said. ‘Struggle will continue’ Kurubur Shanthakumar, president of the Karnataka State Sugarcane Growers’ Association, said, “Our struggle in Karnataka will continue as amendments to the APMC Act and the Land Reforms Act are inimical to the farming sector.” Hailing the farmers’ struggle, he said, “There were concerted efforts to break the struggle and suppress the voice of the farmers but they did not succeed.” State president of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) Kodihalli Chandrashekar, said, “The farmers had taught the BJP regime a lesson that just because you have a majority in the House, you cannot run roughshod over people and farmers’ interests.” Another KRRS leader, Badgalpura Nagendra, said the development was a proof that the government of the day had to bow and listen to the voice of the people. Jayashree Gurannanavar, KRRS and Dalit Sangharsha Samiti leader, asked, “If the Central Government can bring in Ordinances to introduce several laws, why can it not repeal the laws using Ordinances too?”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/farmers-to-now-shift-focus-to-apmc-land-reforms-laws/article37591153.ece
20 November 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Repeal of farm laws: Former techie on solo foot march elated||The Prime Minister’s announcement to withdraw three controversial farm laws has left Nagaraj Kalkutagar with a sense of contentment. He has been on a solo march from Karnataka to the protest site in Delhi since February this year. When he received the news of the PM’s decision, he was moving towards Delhi from Mathura in Uttar Pradesh. “A friend of mine from Delhi called me over the phone and informed me. Meanwhile, a few passers-by also stopped to inform me about the development. They suggested I end this long march as the demand has been met. I am happy. At least after so many days, the government has responded to the protest,” Mr. Nagaraj told The Hindu over phone. He will decide on stopping his journey after talking to the leaders of Samyukt Kisan Morcha. “I will reach Delhi and visit the sites where the farmers staged protest all these days,” said Mr. Nagaraj, who has covered 5,070 km so far. Occasionally, he travelled by vehicles to cross risky stretches. A former techie, 39-year-old Mr. Nagaraj began his unique protest against the farm laws at Male Mahadeshwara Hills in Chamarajanagar district on February 11. With a backpack and a bottle of water, he walked with the objective to meet and interact with as many people as possible about the farm laws. “By now, I completed 185 days and I have interacted with thousands of people. One more meeting is scheduled in a school later today (Friday),” he said. He had to take a break when the State Government announced lockdown during the second wave of COVID-19 in April and restarted the journey on July 3. He took three days’ break again earlier this month, when his mother passed away.  I will reach Delhi and visit the sites where the farmers staged protest all these days.

20 November 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Parties in Hassan celebrate decision||Farmers’ organisations and left parties have termed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s withdrawal of controversial farm laws as the victory of the year-long farmers’ struggle. Amidst jubilation over the Union Government’s decision, the activists have also remembered the sacrifice of farmers, who died during the protest. Members of the Hassan district unit of CPM assembled at the Hemavati Statue Circle and distributed sweets to mark the occasion. They said it was the victory of the farmers’ movement. H.R. Naveen Kumar, president of Hassan district unit of Karnataka Prantha Raitha Sangha, said it was a historic victory of farmers who were firm on their demand and continued their protest fight all odds. “Around 700 farmers died during the protests. Those who opposed the farmers’ protest ran vehicles over the protesters at Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh. The credit of the struggle goes to all of them,” he said. Further, he demanded that the struggle was not against the three farm laws alone. They demanded a law ensuring minimum support price and opposed the proposed electricity bill as well. Sathi Sundaresh, state secretary of CPI, in a press release said the farmers’ struggle that began last year would complete a year on November 27. “All these days, the PM ignored the farmers’ protest as he was keen on safeguarding the interests of corporates. The fear of suffering defeat in the coming elections has prompted him to take this decision. The government should provide relief for all those who lost members of their families during the protest,” he said. Pro-farmer organisations welcomed the move and celebrated the occasion in Chikkamagaluru as well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/parties-in-hassan-celebrate-decision/article37591574.ece

Yediyurappa has said that even after the Legislative Council polls, he would be touring the State and would stay for a day in each district for strengthening the party. Addressing presspersons in Hubbballi on Friday, Mr. Yediyurappa said that the Jan Swaraj Yatra of the party had been organised not just keeping in mind the Council elections but also for reaching out to the people, particularly farmers whose life had been affected badly owing to the natural calamities. The former Chief Minister said that the workers who would assemble for the yatra would be asked to go to the people to hear their grievances and also assist in resolving the issues. “Because of the continuous rainfall, the lives of the farmers have been affected badly. Large-scale crop loss has been reported across the State. Our Government will take steps to disburse compensation to them on a war footing,” he said. To a query, Mr. Yediyurappa said that nobody had tied his hands nor was he being sidelined. “I will be touring the State and indulging in organisational activities in the days to come. My objective will be to further strengthen the party and win 140-plus seats for the party in the next Assembly elections,” he said. He said that BJP would win at least 18 out of the 20 Council seats it was contesting. He said that the core committee had taken a decision to contest only in one seat in dual–member constituencies. “The decision has been taken after due deliberations and the names of the candidates will be announced within a couple of days. In fact the party workers know who the candidates are and they have already started working for the party candidates,” he said. Mr. Yediyurappa said that already BJP had won in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections and only a formality was required to be completed. He said in Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adiytanath had done tremendous work based on which the party would come back to power. The repeal of farm laws by the Union Government would not make any impact on the U.P. elections and also the decision had nothing to do with the debacle in byelections in various States.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/will-continue-tour-of-state-after-council-polls-yediyurappa/article37591351.ece
20 November 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Karnataka Govt. will revive all traditional art forms: Minister||Minister for Kannada, Culture and Energy V. Sunil Kumar said the Government has decided to revive all traditional art forms that are on the wane in Karnataka. Addressing participants at the Sringeri Assembly constituency level Antige-Pintige competition organised by Sri Adi Shankaracharya Sharada Lakshminarsimha Preetam, Shree mutt at Hariharapura in Chikkamagaluru district, he said, “From Bidar to Chamarajanagar, all traditional art forms that are on the wane will be revived. The department is preparing a detailed proposal for the same.” Mr. Kumar said whenever Indian traditional practices were thriving, there was harmony in society. They developed bonding between people and ensured social order. The Government is committed to reviving all such practices by supporting them. Antige-Pintige is one such art form of Malnad region, he said adding the department will soon organise one such event involving teams from Shivamogga, Uttara Kannada, and Chikkamagaluru districts. In his introductory address, one of the organisers Onithota Rathnakar said there were over 600 teams comprising nearly 5,000 members in the three districts. The teams visit every household in their villages during Deepavali season in the night and sing Antige-Pintige folklore and exchange ‘jyothi’ (light). The folklore, he said, was carried forward by word of mouth. Of late, the tradition was disappearing and, as such, the Government should support it on the lines of supporting other traditional art forms in Karnataka. Seer Swayamprakasha Sachchidananda Saraswathi Swami said Antige-Pintige basically involves the spreading of knowledge. The exchange of light during the folklore singing signified this spreading of knowledge. The practice signifies overall growth of human beings. The mutt would always support such events, he said. The competition involves 13 Antige-Pantige teams of Malnad region.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/karnataka-govt-will-revive-all-traditional-art-forms-minister/article37591557.ece
20 November 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Demonetised currency worth Rs. 1.92 crore seized; 3 booked||The Barke police in Mangaluru on Thursday seized demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, amounting to Rs. 1.92 crore from three persons. City Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar told reporters here on Friday that the notes were seized when the accused were attempting to transport the same in a multi-utility vehicle. He gave the names of the accused as Zubair Hammabba, resident of Kannur Borugudde, and Abdul Nasir, resident of Bajpe, both working as drivers, and Deepak Kumar, resident of Veeranagara Padil, working with his electrical contractor father. They were nabbed when a team of Barke police was investigating a theft case. Preliminary inquiry revealed that the accused allegedly procured the notes from a few persons in Shivamogga and Chitradurga districts. The accused reportedly approached some people in Mangaluru offering these notes at 20% of their face value. They claimed that banks would accept such notes at 50% of the face value under some special provision, Mr. Kumar said. Stating that the demonetised notes were not even worth their paper value, the Commissioner urged people not to fall prey to people claiming to offer demonetised currencies at discounted rates. The accused have been booked for the offences of cheating under the Indian Penal Code and The Specified Bank Notes (Cessation of Liabilities) Act, 2017. A person voluntarily holding such ceased currency notes was liable to be punished with Rs. 50,000 or five times the the face value of the notes, whichever is higher, the Cessation Act provides, Mr. Kumar noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/demonetised-currency-worth-rs-192-crore-seized-3-booked/article37591551.ece

20 November 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Laser shoe’ for pain management launched||Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE) launched a ‘laser shoe’, which is a laser instrument developed for diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain on Friday. The shoe has been developed with financial grant from the Union Department of Science and Technology, a MAHE release said. Launching the product, Pro Chancellor of MAHE H.S. Ballal said that there is a need for cost-effective pain management for neuropathic pain in diabetes mellitus. In India there is increasing prevalence of diabetes and need for early screening of complication associated with diabetes mellitus especially foot related complications in diabetes, he said. Principal investigator of the project G. Arun Maiya, Professor and Dean, Manipal College of Health Professions, said that the product is clinically validated and is now ready for commercialisation. An effective means of identifying and treating peripheral neuropathy would have a major impact medically, socially as well as economically, as foot ulceration paves the way to 80% of amputations. Dr. Maiya said that the existing available laser instruments used for pain management of various musculoskeletal conditions and tissue healing are not specific to the foot region. The existing scanning method of laser application to the foot is not covering the entire area of the foot to improve microcirculation of the foot. “Considering the higher burden of diabetic peripheral neuropathy in the Indian population, we have developed and validated laser shoe technology a cost-effective laser instrument, focusing exclusively on the entire foot region for the management of neuropathic pain in people living with type II diabetes mellitus,” the release quoted him of having said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/laser-shoe-for-pain-management-launched/article37591559.ece

20 November 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Art director’s dispute with Railways out in the open||A dispute over settlement of bills between the Railways and art director John Devaraj over the recreation of Arasalu Railway Station in Shivamogga district into the Malgudi Museum has come out in the open. Mr. Devaraj held a demonstration outside the office of South Western Railways, Mysuru division, here on Friday and has accused the Railways of failing to settle his bills relating to converting the ruined and dilapidated railway station at Arasalu into Malgudi Museum, which was inaugurated in August 2020. Work had started soon after an agreement for works was entered on May 24, 2019, for a total amount of Rs. 38.14 lakh, he said while adding that the first four bills for Rs. 21.96 lakh were settled without any problem. However, after the fifth bill for Rs. 12.89 lakh, including Rs. 3.94 lakh that had been spent out of his own pocket was submitted in October 2020, the Railways had paid only the Rs. 3.94 lakh, he said while claiming that a net balance of Rs. 8.94 lakh was due to him. However, the office of South Western Railways, Mysuru division, said that the artist did not agree to the final payment made to him for the work executed by him after it was evaluated vis-à-vis the specifications and other terms and conditions of the contract. When the dispute could not be settled through conciliation proceedings, the South Western Railway headquarters, as per the standard practice adopted to resolve such disputes, approved the appointment of an arbitrator in the case. Instead of taking the opportunity to resolve the dispute through an established procedure for such cases, Mr. Devaraj had preferred to act otherwise, the Railways has regretted in a statement. However, Mr. Devaraj has rejected the arbitration process by contending that he would have to shell out more money to bear the heavy costs of arbitration process that would be conducted by retired railway officials. “I have repeatedly made it clear that I am not interested in initiating an arbitration,” he said. In a statement here on Friday when Mr. Devaraj chose to hold a demonstration outside its office, the Railways said all the payments made were scrutinised by the accounts wing of the Railways and, as such the averment that decisions were unilateral is far from the truth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/art-directors-dispute-with-railways-out-in-the-open/article37591583.ece
20 November 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||State farmers to focus on repeal of Land Reforms Act, APMC Act||Farmers in Karnataka who were protesting against the three contentious farm laws will seek repeal of the Land Reforms Act and amendments to the APMC Act in the state. While the nationwide agitation was against the repealing of the three laws, the farmers in the state were also peeved with the two laws passed by the BJP Government having a direct bearing on agriculture and farmers and were protesting against them. This was the Karnataka Land Reforms Act, which eased the restriction on purchase of agricultural land enabling anyone to purchase it and use it for non-agricultural purpose. Similarly, the amendment to the APMC Act allowed the private players to purchase agricultural commodities from the farmers. However, the farmers were opposed to it on the ground that it will pave way for entry of MNCs and corporates who would dictate both the cropping pattern and price. Kurubur Shanthkumar, president, Karnataka Sugarcane Cultivators Association, said farmers are soaking up the victory against the centre which was forced to repeal the three farm laws. “But our struggle in the state will continue as the amendments to the APMC Act and the Land Reforms Act is inimical to the farming sector in the long run,” he added. Mr. Shanthakumar said the Land Reforms Act would sound the death knell to farmers with small and medium-sized landholdings. “This will trigger a mass shift from agriculture among these farmers who will end up as daily wagers in urban areas besides losing their land which, so far, has enabled them to live with dignity despite the difficulties in the agricultural sector,” said Mr. Shanthakumar. Protests against these reforms got dovetailed with the agitation against the three farm laws of the centre. Now that the central laws are set to be repealed, farmers will shift the focus to the state laws, according to the association members. Farmers and activists supporting their cause have also argued that the Land Reforms Act and corporatisation of agriculture was a threat to the food security.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-farmers-to-focus-on-repeal-of-land-reforms-act-apmc-act/article37591577.ece
20 November 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Siddaramaiah alleges huge commission in contracts, wants Govt. dismissed||Claiming that the State contractors’ association had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the difficulties they were enduring while coughing up huge sums of money as commission to executing government contracts, former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Friday said he would soon be writing to Governor Thaawarchand Gehlot to dismiss the Government. Speaking to reporters here, he alleged that the association representatives had claimed that the contractors in the State were forced to pay anywhere between 35 to 40 per cent of the project cost to Ministers and MLAs. “So, this Government is immersed in corruption. I never saw a Government that took so much of commission. This Government should be immediately dismissed,” he said. Mr. Siddaramaiah said the association representatives had even revealed the departments where they had to pay a huge amount as commission and named Rural Development, Minor and Major Irrigation, Public Works Department, and Urban Development among them. “If I make the allegation, they will say that I am saying so because I am from the Opposition party. But the people, who pay, have themselves come out in the open and saying so. This Government is not fit to remain in power,” Mr. Siddaramaiah said. With regard to the Centre’s decision to withdraw the controversial farm laws, Mr. Siddaramaiah said the BJP Government at the Centre was not willing to recognise the protesters as “farmers” initially. “They were saying that the protesters were not farmers, but people, who had been instigated by the Congress. The farmers have protested for more than 10 months and have triumphed,” he said before claiming that the BJP Government at the Centre had succumbed to the protest by farmers.  Mr. Siddaramaiah lost his cool when supporters of an aspirant for the Congress nomination to the upcoming Legislative Council elections gathered outside his residence here. An angry Siddaramaiah told the group of people, who were reportedly supporters of former Mysuru Zilla Panchayat chairman K. Mari Gowda, that they were responsible for his loss in the Assembly elections from Chamundeshwari in 2018. He asked them whether they were not ashamed of seeking a ticket from him after allegedly conspiring to defeat him in the elections. Mr. Mari Gowda is among the 10 aspirants for the Congress nomination to the Legislative Council elections from Mysuru-Chamarajanagar Local Areas constituency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/siddaramaiah-alleges-huge-commission-in-contracts-wants-govt-dismissed/article37591586.ece

Compared to this in highways, they can cover over 2.50 km per litre of diesel.” Of the total 190 low-floor AC buses which were withdrawn from service following the pandemic, 106 have been rolled out after urgent repairs. Forty of them have been deployed to ferry pilgrims to Sabarimala. The over 60 buses are idling at the Kerala Urban Road Transport Corporation’s (KURTC) weed-infested depot at Thevara here. They need repairs costing up to Rs. 6 lakh per bus. Once this is done, they will be deployed as bypass rider services on the Thiruvananthapuram-Kozhikode route. Volvo is willing to provide a service coordinator and talks are on to get genuine spares, he said. Official sources attributed the deteriorating condition of the buses, each of which is priced at Rs. 1 crore, and their worn-off exteriors to the delay in repairing dents, damaged components and the doubtable quality of painting in the RTC’s workshops. “This is in stark contrast with the upkeep and aesthetics of AC buses maintained by RTCs of neighbouring States – especially Karnataka. Timely maintenance is crucial since it also reflects in the form of higher fuel efficiency of buses operated by most other RTCs in the country,” they said. City buses The KSRTC hopes to receive funds from the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, using which a fleet of city service buses which are smaller than conventional low-floor buses will be introduced in Kochi. With the Thevara depot having little relevance (and plans under way to convert it into a hub for caravan tourism), they would be based at KSRTC’s main depot in the city, Mr. Prabhakar added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/60-idling-low-floor-buses-to-be-redeployed/article37591444.ece
20 November 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Commercial space up for grabs in metro stations||Buoyed by the response to the leasing out of 311 kiosk spaces at Kochi metro stations, Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) is toying with the idea to lease out the balance 35,000 sq ft of commercial space in the stations to offices, supermarkets and other ventures. Entrepreneurs took over the around 200 of the 311 kiosk spaces at metro stations in the Aluva-Pettah corridor, at an auction held earlier this month to mobilise revenue from non-ticketing sources for the metro’s operation and maintenance. Yet another auction of rest of the commercial spaces will be held from December 13 to 15. A key area of focus will be to lease out 8,000 sq ft of space at Aluva station and 9,000 sq ft at Ernakulam South station. They would be apt for supermarkets – each of which need an average of 3,000 sq ft area, metro sources said. As for lease conditions, there are two options – the monthly rental or the revenue sharing models. This will be finalised after discussions with stakeholders who come forward to take over the spaces. Yet another plan that KMRL had — to hand over vacant spaces near/at metro stations to entrepreneurs on long-term lease, following which they would be permitted to construct a building on mutually-agreeable terms — has been temporarily put on hold. This is because most firms would prefer ventures within stations, they added. 17-acre farm In the meantime, KMRL has tied up with the Horticulture Department to ready a farm in 17.43 acres of government land in Kakkanad that was handed over to it a year ago for its Rs. 3,000-crore Bliss City project. The project was envisaged as a modern entertainment zone, a wellness and wholesome entertainment destination for Kochiites and tourists, the revenue from which would be used for the metro’s operation and maintenance. The land will be used for farming, until a solid plan emerges on making optimal utility of the space, it is learnt.  Entrepreneurs took over around 200 of the 311 kiosk spaces in the Aluva-Pettah corridor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/commercial-space-up-for-grabs-in-kochi-metro-stations/article37591452.ece
20 November 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Corporation to issue licences to all eligible street vendors by Nov-end||The Kochi Corporation remains confident of issuing identity cards and licences to all eligible 876 street vendors within its limits by the end of this month as directed by the High Court. The High Court had recently asked the civic body to complete the process of issuing identity cards and certificates of vending before November 30 and that no one without the certificate issued by the Town Vending Committee should be allowed thereafter. Street vendors who are operating within the limits of the corporation without obtaining licences can approach the Town Vending Committee. On receiving the application, the committee should pass the orders on such applications within one month. However, from December 1, such applicants should not be permitted to carry out street vending till they obtained the certificate from the committee, the court directed. “A survey conducted by the corporation using an agency has found 876 street vendors within the city limits to be eligible for identity cards and licence under the National Urban Livelihood Mission. We have already issued identity cards to 700 of them. We are confident of issuing licences and cards to all the eligible vendors within the time frame set by the court since we have their complete database,” said a corporation official. Once that process is completed, the corporation will receive fresh applications and then verify their credentials with the help of an agency. Meanwhile, the corporation has started evicting unauthorised vendors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/corporation-to-issue-licences-to-all-eligible-street-vendors-by-nov-end/article37591453.ece
20 November 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Grant of bail to all accused stumps investigators||The Crime Branch (CB), which on Friday took over the probe into the accident at Chakkaraparambu, is staring at a difficult task with the magistrate court granting bail to all the accused, including the owner of the hotel where the victims had allegedly partied late into the night. The Crime Branch will now have to rely mostly on witness statements. Additional Commissioner K.P. Philip, who is holding the charge of the District Police Chief (Kochi City), will supervise the investigation. The accident had claimed three lives, including two promising models, while returning from the hotel in Fort Kochi in the wee hours of November 1. What was initially considered an accident turned controversial after it emerged that the hard disc containing the footage of the party was allegedly destroyed by the hotel owner and his staff and that another car had tailed the ill-fated car before it met with an accident. Sources said that the possibility of retrieving the party visuals remain slim since the visuals were not recorded on any storage device other than the hard disk. To overcome the obstacle, the investigating team has started the painstaking process of interviewing every possible witness to find if any offence was committed in the party that night. About 50 persons reportedly attended the party. While speculation is rife about the presence of a VIP at the party, the police continue to deny it, claiming that there was no evidence to suggest that. Meanwhile, the police are about to file a report in the High Court in response to the anticipatory bail petition moved by Syju Thankachan, who allegedly followed the ill-fated car. He had claimed all along that he had followed the victims in an attempt to stop the drunk Abdul Rahman, the driver of the ill-fated car and first accused in the case, from driving.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/grant-of-bail-to-all-accused-stumps-investigators/article37591459.ece

Independent councillor P.C. Manoop gave the statement. He stated that he was aware of the payment by Ms. Thankappan and that the ruling party councillors had told him about it. Mr. Manoop said that the media had aired the audio clip of UDF councillors talking about the matter and visuals of opposition councillors returning the covers containing the money. The statement was recorded by Circle Inspector C.A. Vimal at the office of DySP, VACB. The recording of the statement lasted nearly four hours. The controversy erupted after the municipality allegedly paid money to the councillors along with dresses distributed to the aged. The investigation was launched after the opposition councillors lodged a complaint. The VACB had earlier inspected the municipal office. The opposition had staged a series of protests against the Chairperson in the wake of the controversy. The VACB had submitted a quick verification report and the statement of the councillor marked the launch of a detailed investigation. The agency is set to record the statement of more councillors in the days to come.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vacb-records-councillors-statement-in-gift-controversy/article37591460.ece

The Bench comprising Justice Anil K. Narendran and Justice P.G. Ajithkumar also directed that besides the spot- booking centre at Nilackal, spot booking shall be permitted at other centres for available slots during the Mandalam-Makaravilakku pilgrimage season. The court observed that spot booking at centres other than Nilackal could not be confined to darshan on the date of booking or the very next day. The court added that spot booking was insisted by the court to ensure that devotees who did not have the facilities required for online booking were given an opportunity to have Sabarimala darshan. The court also asked the Travancore Devaswom Board and the authorities concerned to notify this information in the print and visual media and also at the spot-booking centres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-tells-tdb-to-consider-spot-booking-at-temples/article37591468.ece
20 November 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Sexagenarian all set to celebrate his 100th marathon||Paul Padinjarekkara ran his first marathon quite late in life. After retirement, aged 60. But since then, he has not stopped running and is now set to celebrate his 100th marathon this Sunday. And quite fittingly, he will run a full marathon of 42.20 km with 100 other fellow runners organised by his fans and well-wishers in his honour. A half marathon will also be held alongside. “My first full marathon was the Spice Coast Marathon organised by the Soles of Cochin. I will run the same route to mark the occasion,” said the 67-year-old who retired as superintending engineer from Cochin Port Trust in 2014 and is settled at Maradu. The marathon will be flagged off from Willingdon Island and pass through Mattancherry and Fort Kochi before returning to the starting point and then to Ernakulam and back. While quite an exciting prospect, Paul’s most memorable run remains the 100 km he ran to mark his 62nd birthday. He started from his house at Maradu and returned after touching Muvattupuzha and Kothamangalam before again setting out for his ancestral home at Neendapara in Neriamangalam. “I use an app to record all my runs. Besides, I note them down in a diary and total them monthly and annually,” said Paul. And, going by those multiple records, he has so far run 20,000 km with the best timing of 4.27 hours to complete a full marathon. Paul has run almost all important marathons across the country, with his longest run being the 210 km he ran as part of the Hennur Bamboo Ultra Marathon in Bengaluru. In fact, he has so far run 22 ultra marathons, which are endurance tests stretching way beyond the full marathon length of 42.20 km. “I was always drawn into running and participated in 5,000-m races during my school days, winning many prizes. But work left me with little time for anything else,” said Paul, who now seems determined to dedicate his retirement life to wrest back the 36 years when he sacrificed his passion for his career.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sexagenarian-all-set-to-celebrate-his-100th-marathon/article37591446.ece

The organisation has flourished, finding employment opportunities for women and providing them social and economic support through a number of group-based activities that range from micro-enterprises to social empowerment activities. Mission sources said the elections to the three-tier Kudumbashree setup had been postponed for a year due to the COVID-19 lockdown as well as last year’s elections to local government bodies. The Kudumbashree office bearers are elected for a period of three years. Joint liability groups One of the most significant efforts by the Mission has been to float joint liability groups (JLGs) for promoting agricultural activities. There are a total of 5,872 JLGs in the Ernakulam district and 26,203 women are involved in cultivating a total extent of 2,495 hectares. The crops being cultivated range from banana to vegetables and paddy. The Kudumbashree Poverty Eradication Mission is an offshoot of the People’s Plan Campaign with focus on decentralised planning. The State Government ordered the formation of a State Poverty Eradication Mission in the State Budget for 1997-98 and the mission mode programme was inaugurated in Malappuram in May 1998. Local body funds It has been envisaged that the three tiers of the Kudumbashree functioning would remain independent of the local self-government bodies, with the CDS organisations being accountable to the local bodies for the funds received from them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kudumbashree-mission-elections-to-be-held-on-december-20/article37591462.ece

When a writ petition alleging police harassment by a former driver of Monson came up for hearing, Jaishankar Nair, counsel appearing for the Enforcement Directorate, submitted before Justice Devan Ramachandran that there had been some delay in registering the Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) because of the delay on the part of the police in registering cases against Monson. The Enforcement Directorate could register a case only on the basis of an FIR registered by the police. Monetary aspects He submitted that the ED could investigate only into the monetary aspects of a crime. The Enforcement Directorate would certainly look into the financial trail of the alleged scam. But if Monson had committed any offences or any other person in collaboration with him, including the woman whose name had been mentioned in the intelligence report, other agencies such as the Central Bureau of Investigation might have to step in. He would obtain information in this regard from competent authorities by the next date of hearing and would place the details of the investigation before the court in a week's time. The court posted the petition for further hearing on December 1.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/case-registered-against-monson-ed-tells-hc/article37591467.ece

Rema Ramesh who runs the eatery opposite the Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA) office at Kadavanthra has been protesting with her daughter Aparna Ramesh since Thursday night. “We have been running the eatery at this location for over a decade. We are even in the list of eligible street vendors published by the corporation though our address has been erroneously given as division 62. This was done deliberately by division councillor Malini Kurup in connivance with the vendor in our neighbourhood,” said Aparna. However, Ms. Kurup shot down the allegations and stated that the eatery was set up without authorisation at the current location as recent as August and that they were eligible to operate it at South, division 62. “A councillor cannot intervene in such matters as the decision has been taken by the corporation as per a court decision. The Girinagar Welfare Association gave me a petition complaining about the eatery and it was handed over to corporation Secretary,” she said. Association general convener Iype Joseph confirmed it and accused the eatery of being run in violation of COVID protocol besides causing traffic congestion in the area. “It was being operated on the strength of a stay secured by the vendor from the High Court on a writ petition against the eviction. However, since then the Association had impleaded in the case and the court had directed to take an appropriate decision after hearing all the parties, including the corporation,” he said. “Following a survey held since then, we had found them to be eligible to run the eatery in division 62,” said a corporation official concerned. In between, the vendor had approached the civic body to change the address of the eatery to division 55.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/woman-street-vendor-continues-protest/article37591455.ece

The procurement would be done only on the basis of the quality of samples collected in depots in each district. Samples would be collected from manufacturing hubs. The price of medicines sold through Supplyco outlets would be reduced further. The margin from sale of insulin products would be reduced from 50% to 22%, while that of other medicines which yielded 50% margin would be reduced to 25%. The margin for sale of medical and surgical equipments and FMCG goods too would be limited between 5% and 20%, Mr, Anil said. Price hike He said that Supplyco's market intervention helped rein in the price of essential commodities. The price of 13 items of daily use were not hiked at all during the past five-and-a-half years, while steps were taken to lessen the price of a few among them. In addition, ration cards were now easier to get and complaint boxes had been kept at ration shops, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/supplyco-to-plug-loopholes-in-procurement/article37591461.ece

And for Gopinathan and his wife, Jagadamma, residents of Sreerekha Bhavan, it is the end of a 36-year-old ordeal. The family has finally found a safe abode and they are no more worried about atmospheric salinity and humidity of the island corroding the structure. A concept put forward by present Finance Minister K.N. Balagopal, the project was taken up and successfully completed by the Architects Association. Many areas in the island are facing the threat of submergence, making normal construction methods impossible. An Assembly committee that studied the environmental issues of Munroe Thuruth had recommended eco-friendly methods of construction and the grama panchayat too had come up with a draft masterplan to mitigate the challenges. The highlight of the house is its unique construction method that helps it withstand tidal flooding and waterlogging during rain. Eco-friendly style An eco-friendly style of construction, it uses light-weight bricks and metal sheets that suit the terrain. The structure stands 4 ft above ground so that water will not enter the house even when the water level rises. “We will check if this method can be followed in other places prone to flooding. If this puts an end to the distress of islanders, the same system can be replicated in low-lying areas,” said Mr.Balagopal. Amphibious houses are usually floating structures or those built on stilts. Material that can resist water is used for construction and the houses come with chemical toilets. Since tidal flooding is a recurrent problem on the island, attached toilets in most houses are useless during high tide. The local body had installed several bio-toilets, but access is not easy during heavy rain. Amphibious houses are expected to solve this problem permanently.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/many-a-rain-passes-amphibious-house-stays-afloat/article37591512.ece

The civic body needs 103 ASHA workers. However, the District Programme Manager of Arogya Keralam has permitted it to appoint only 50 workers in the first phase. The final list of 50 ASHA workers was prepared after interviewing 196 candidates. It was approved by the health standing committee before being presented before the council. Opposition councillors alleged that a majority of selected candidates were either CPI(M) loyalists or spouses of party activists. Several councillors complained that more qualified candidates whom they had hand-picked were rejected in favour of party nominees. “I even met a candidate who is a regular tax payer and attended the interview for fun,” said Nadakkavu councillor Alphonsa Mathew. Panniyankara councillor K. Nirmala said councillors had no say in the matter unless they belonged to the ruling front. Anganwadis Earlier, Pokkunnu councillor K. Issah Ahamed made a submission on the condition of anganwadis functioning from rented buildings and the inability to renew contracts with landlords in many cases. He suggested that the Corporation enforce the Government directive to accommodate anganwadis in nearby Government schools, if possible. The submission led to a prolonged discussion on how hard it was to get the school authorities to agree to it, despite both schools and anganwadis coming under the Corporation. However, the council decided to press the matter further. Puthiyara councillor T. Rinish brought up the issue of encroachment on Government land by a private agency against whom the Corporation had failed to initiate action. He said the agency had encroached upon the land belonging to Comtrust, filled the drain passing though it, and converted the land into a private parking area. The Corporation had served notice on the agency 20 days ago, but it had not paid heed to it. He asked as to why the Corporation was not taking stringent action. The superintending engineer said the agency had been directed to clear the soil it had dumped on the land. At the same time, the Mayor advised all councillors to be vigilant against encroachment on Government land and inform officials immediately if such instances came to their notice. Paroppadi councillor K.C. Shobhita said several LED boards and digital display boards had been erected in the city without the Corporation’s permission, thus cheating it out of its revenue. She demanded the Town Planning wing to submit a list of legitimate hoardings and LED display boards. Kommeri councillor Kavita Arun lamented the poor condition of the V.K. Krishna Menon Smriti Vanam at Eravathukunnu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/row-in-corpn-over-selection-of-asha-workers/article37591432.ece

Several stray dogs are being taken to the Corporation’s ABC Centre for sterilisation and brought back, while many are found with puppies, she said questioning the very purpose of sterilisation. Other councillors too pitched in raising similar issues in their wards and demanded a viable solution. Congress councillor K.C. Shobitha pointed out that the District Collector and the Sub Divisional Magistrate had powers to issue temporary orders to keep dangerous animals under protective custody. However, councillor C.M. Jamsheer said the provision did not encompass stray dogs, but only wild animals. IUML councillor K. Moideen Koya suggested that stray dogs be captured and put in shelters where they could be sterilised. Mayor Beena Philip admitted that the Corporation was in a difficult situation, and that it was bound to follow the orders of the Supreme Court on stray dogs. She said Kozhikode was the first Corporation in the State to start an ABC Centre to counter stray dog menace, and that it was launching a stray dog adoption programme this week. No concrete solution emerged during the meeting, and the Mayor said the Corporation would consider opening stray dog shelters if suitable land and facilities to feed them were available. For the record, the civic body had increased staff strength at the ABC Centre at Poolakkadavu a month ago to speed up the sterilisation process. The Mayor said the ABC programme would take at least 10 years to show proper results, and that the number of stray dogs was likely to go up considerably before it comes down in 10 years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/council-debates-stray-dog-menace-in-city/article37591431.ece

People used to buying goods from ration shops in the State will stop for a while before approaching this counter. Yes, it is a modernised ration shop at Kadampuzha. The ration shop (ARD number 168) owned by Kadmpuzha Moosa, working president of the Kerala State Retail Ration Dealers Association (KSRRDA), is set to create history when Food and Civil Supplies Minister G.R. Anil inaugurates the modernised ration shop on Saturday afternoon. “You will not have to go into a congested room any more for billing and collecting your ration goods. You can buy your ration enjoying the high-tech facility,” said Mr. Moosa. According to him, it will be the first high-tech ration shop in the State. The first thing welcoming a customer at the 4,000-sq-ft ration shop will be a sanitiser machine functioning with a sensor. The first counter will offer computerised billing. Prices and stock details will be displayed on a large digital screen. The customers will not have to stand in long queues. They can rest in a room and enjoy their favourite TV shows and music. Kerosene dispenser “Gone are the days when we used to suck out liquids like kerosene and oil from large cans. Instead, we will be using a sensor-aided mechanism in which a customer will have to place their can or bottle under a tap. The kerosene allotted to them will be poured automatically into their bottle or can. Everything will be automated,” said Mr. Moosa, explaining the functioning of the high-tech ration shop. When the goods are weighed, customers can see the quantity details on a digital screen kept outside. “The technology and facilities have been available to us for long. Then why not apply it to our ration shops? Ration shops don’t have to be the same,” said Mr. Moosa. Sayed Abid Husain Thangal, MLA of Kottakkal, will preside over the inaugural function. Kurukkoli Moideen, MLA of Tirur, will be the chief guest. Kadampuzha panchayat president Sajna, district panchayat member Moorkkath Hamza, KSRRDA State president Mohammed Ali and leaders of various trade and civic organisations are expected to attend.

20 November 2021||PALAKKAD,KERALA||Playing with anamorphic art||Seeking endless experiments and innovations is often considered the hallmark of a great artist. Rajendran Vadakkepadath who carved a niche for himself through his leaf paintings has puzzled his followers with anamorphic art. Although anamorphic art is not too unfamiliar for the current generation, the number of artists dabbling in this unique genre of painting is far too few. “I have not come across any artist in Kerala doing anamorphosis,” said Mr. Rajendran. The artist from Chittur mystified his friends and followers on social media when he posted a smiling image of Tamil actor Suriya in a cylindrical mirror. Anamorphic art gives a distorted image of the subject represented in a picture. But if viewed from a particular angle or reflected in a curved mirror, the image in the picture appears normal. Instead of a curved mirror, Mr. Rajendran uses a piece of steel pipe for reflection. “A glass mirror is risky. It can break if not handled carefully,” he said. Images of actors For over six months, Mr. Rajendran racked his brain over the idea of anamorphosis. It took about a week for him to give life to Suriya in anamorphic form. He followed it up with the images of Rajinikanth in Annaatthe and Mohanlal in Kunhali Marakkar . Anamorphic art is not an undemanding task for an artist. According to Mr. Rajendran, it is a nerve-racking ordeal. “It’s a complicated art. That’s why most people do not take it up,” he said. Explaining his method, Mr. Rajendran said it involved stretching an image into 360 degrees. The image’s distortion will be solved when it is reflected on a 360-degree cylinder. “The science is simple. But it takes a lot of patience while executing,” he said. It was a distorted picture of British scientist John Dalton outside the Science and Industry Museum in Manchester, U.K., that triggered an interest in Mr. Rajendran. “It happened at a time when I was thinking about giving a surprise to our art lovers,” he said. Though it is said to have originated in China, anamorphic art was in use for centuries. “I learned stories about kings using this art to cleverly encrypt their messages,” he said. As it cannot be hung on a wall, anamorphic art does not usually get along with the traditional paintings. It can best be used in large spaces. Mr. Rajendran is planning to send out a COVID-19 message through an anamorphic project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/an-artist-playing-with-anamorphic-art/article37591525.ece

20 November 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Spike in leptospirosis cases||Leptospirosis cases and deaths have spiralled up in all districts in the aftermath of heavy rain and flooding. Even though the Health Department has launched an awareness drive on the efficacy of doxycycline prophylaxis, the health advisories seem to be falling on deaf ears. In a health system preoccupied with COVID-19, the increasing number of deaths due to communicable diseases is not getting adequate attention, many health officials say. “Patients and even doctors seem to be discounting the possibility that a patient presenting with fever and myalgia these days could be having a disease other than COVID such as dengue and leptospirosis. People go back home relieved that they tested negative for COVID, but in less than a week, their condition worsens. Missed diagnosis and late diagnosis of leptospirosis have emerged as a pandemic-related problem,” says an official. High mortality Leptospirosis has high mortality but is easily prevented by the prophylactic administration of doxycycline . However, failure to recognise the anicteric form of leptospirosis, when the disease presents as a mild, febrile illness with body pain, seems to be the current issue. “Anicteric form of leptospirosis is mild and flu-like but an early diagnosis and treatment is crucial so that the patient does not go into later complications. Beyond COVID, other clinical possibilities should be kept open. It is the clinician’s skill in suspecting lepto which makes the difference between a patient living or dying,” he says. Leptospirosis cases are reported throughout the year in Kerala, with occasional spurts during monsoon months. The disease-causing organism is transmitted through contact of the skin and mucous membranes with water or mud contaminated with rodent and other animal urine. During heavy flooding, the infectious organism is spread to larger and distant areas and, hence, everyone who come into contact with overflowing waters are at risk of contracting the infection. Change in disease profile “Usually, we suspect leptospirosis in people living in rural areas, those engaged in agrarian activity or canal/cleaning work. But the altered rainfall pattern in the State in recent times and continuous episodes of flooding and rainwater stagnation, even in urban areas, have changed the seasonality of the disease and even the profile/social strata of those affected. Cases are going up in urban areas now,” says a senior clinician. In 2018, 2,079 confirmed cases and 99 deaths were reported in the State, two-thirds of which were reported in September, two weeks after the major floods in August. In 2019, 1,211 confirmed cases and 57 deaths were reported. However, this year, as of November 19, 1,333 confirmed cases and 46 deaths (2,053 suspected cases and 180 suspected deaths) have been reported.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/spike-in-leptospirosis-cases/article37591477.ece
20 November 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||BJP alleges graft in LED light project||The Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) walked out of a city Corporation council meeting held on Friday accusing the ruling party of indulging in corruption in a project related to the installation of street lights in the city. However, Mayor Arya Rajendran maintained that the project was awarded to a public sector company by following all norms and with the approval of the council. BJP councillor Karamana Ajith, who had earlier raised the allegations in a Facebook post, said the project to replace 18,000 street lights with LED lights was awarded to United Electrical Industries Limited without calling an e-tender. Lesser rate He alleged that the company was chosen, despite there being other companies offering lights at cheaper rates, because the relative of a Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader is part of its management. The Corporation could have got the lights at a lesser rate, if it had gone through the tender route. In her reply, the Mayor said that as per a Government Order issued in August 2018, local bodies can purchase LED lights from the public sector company United Electrical Industries Limited without calling for tenders. During the previous council’s tenure, Rs. 18 crore was deposited with the Kerala State Electricity Board, which had purchased lights from the central PSU Energy Efficiency Services Limited. But, they had not carried out maintenance work properly, she said. Ahead of the Assembly elections earlier this year, following complaints from councillors about non-functioning street lights, the steering committee had given approval for purchasing 10,000 lights, said Ms. Rajendran. The finance standing committee, where BJP has a majority, approved this decision, which was later placed in the council, where it was finally cleared. None of the BJP councillors had raised an issue with the clearance at that time. The allegations of corruption are baseless as the money is transferred to a public sector company’s account. Communist Party of India councillor Rakhi Ravikumar accused Mr. Ajith of raising baseless allegations and targetting women leaders. The BJP councillors took umbrage to a comment she made against Mr. Ajith and wanted the remark to be withdrawn. Later, the councillors staged a walkout. The Left Democratic Front councillors then distributed laddoos to celebrate the proposed repealing of the farm laws enacted by the BJP-led Union Government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bjp-alleges-graft-in-led-light-project/article37591682.ece

Cryptocarya muthuvariana has been named so to honour the Muthuvar tribe and as it was discovered in their neighbourhood, researchers responsible for the identification said.  Annales Botanici Fennici , a scientific journal brought out by the Finnish Zoological and Botanical Publishing Board, has published the findings on the new species by R. Jagadeesan, former researcher, Department of Botany, University of Kerala; A. Gangaprasad, Professor, Department of Botany, and Director, Centre for Biodiversity Conservation, University of Kerala; and P. Suresh Kumar and Sam P. Mathew of the Jawaharlal Nehru Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute (JNTBGRI), Palode. During survey Belonging to the Lauraceae family, the genus Cryptocarya comprises over 300 species that are widely distributed over South America, South Africa, Madagascar, Asia, Australia and Oceania. The researchers came across the new species during surveys on endemic and threatened species of the Western Ghats. Detailed studies showed it to be a distinct species.  Cryptocarya muthuvariana grows to a height of about 10 to 15 m and is characterised by not-too-broad leaves. The researchers managed to spot only around 10 individual trees of the species in the locality. The Western Ghats is home to around nine species of the genus Cryptocarya, they said. The team has underscored the need to study aspects related to ecological importance, medicinal value and sustainable use of the new tree species.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/new-tree-species-named-after-muthuvar-tribe/article37591527.ece
20 November 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Infighting in Loktantric Janata Dal reaches a flashpoint||The factional feud in the Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) appeared to reach a flashpoint on Friday. State general secretaries Sheik. P. Haris and V. Surendran Pillai met CPI(M) leaders at AKG Centre here to stake their claim as true representatives of the LJD, seemingly tottering at the brink of a vertical split. Both leaders had sought the removal of M.V. Shreyams Kumar, MP, as LJD State president. They reportedly told the CPI(M) leaders that their faction had the backing of K.P. Mohanan, the LJD's sole legislator from the Koothuparambu constituency in Kannur. The leaders reportedly told the CPI(M) leaders that they feared Mr. Kumar would expel them from the LJD at the party's State working committee meeting in Kozhikode on Saturday. They requested the CPI(M) to consider them as the LJD official faction in such an eventuality. The leaders demanded that the Left Democratic Front (LDF) assign boards and Corporations to their nominees and reject those proposed by Mr. Kumar. The LJD leaders denied that their factions would merge with the Janata Dal (S), another LDF partner. They reportedly told the CPI(M) that Mr. Kumar's faction had spread the rumour that they would defect to the JD(S) to hurt them. Many LJD workers in Malabar were averse to aligning with the JD(S). Both the leaders opposed Mr. Kumar's "corporate style" functioning. Mr. Haris and Mr. Pillai reportedly rebuffed LJD general secretary Varghese George's contention that the party would stay united despite the divergent views of its senior leaders. The CPI(M) has reportedly braced itself for a showdown in the LJD. By one account, the CPI(M) has asked the LJD leaders to find common ground and prevent infighting from escalating into a split and mutual expulsions. Meanwhile, Mr. Kumar's supporters reportedly met in Kozhikode to express solidarity with the LJD State president ahead of the conclave. Mr. Haris and Mr. Pillai claimed to have the support of LJD's rank and file. They met CPI(M) Polit Bureau member Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, CPI(M) acting State secretary A. Vijayaraghavan and CPI State secretary Kanam Rajendran.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/infighting-in-ljd-reaches-a-flashpoint/article37591441.ece

20 November 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Aiming to make State antibiotic literate||The first initiative to make Kerala fully antibiotic literate, as part of its antimicrobial resistance (AMR) strategic action plan (KARSAP), has been launched. The aim is to achieve full antibiotic literacy in the State within two years, said Health Minister, Veena George on Friday. The Health Department kicked off a series of awareness programmes as part of World Antimicrobial Awareness Week, which is observed from November 18 to 24 every year. The 2021 theme, ‘Spread Awareness, Stop Resistance’, calls on One Health stakeholders, policymakers, health-care providers and the public to be ‘Antimicrobial Resistance Awareness’ champions. The State Government will launch various initiatives to create antibiotic awareness amongst various sections of the population, including schoolchildren this week. A webinar series on antibiotic resistance was also started by the Health Department, in which various experts will participate. A detailed set of guidelines and action plan would be formulated at the webinar, and this will aid the State’s efforts to achieve total antibiotic literacy. World Antibiotic Awareness Week aims to increase global awareness of antibiotic resistance and to encourage best practices among the public, health workers and policy makers to avoid the further emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance. Even though antibiotics have a crucial role in modern medicine, the persistent overuse and abuse of antibiotics for human and animal health has led to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance. The focus will be on creating adequate educational messages so that people understand how they might be unknowingly contributing towards AMR and teach them about the rational use of antibiotics. The idea is to give specific messages on the changes in behaviour that individuals should adopt, to reduce antimicrobial resistance. Reducing the unnecessary use of antibiotics, using antibiotics as prescribed by doctor, disposing of used or date-expired antibiotics safely, and not dumping them in waterbodies, are some behaviour changes the campaign aims.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/aiming-to-make-state-antibiotic-literate/article37591679.ece

The State Forest Minister will also seek the Centre’s financial support to implement the action plan prepared by the Forest Department to tackle the mounting human-animal conflict in the State. The action plan has been formulated on the basis of feedback collected from people’s representatives and the public. An official press note quoting Mr.Saseendran said the State Government had taken steps to tackle the wild boar menace by allowing persons with licensed firearms to kill them. Schedule 3 He, however, said repeated appeals to the Centre to declare wild pigs as vermin had not yielded results. Wild pigs are included in Schedule 3 of the Wildlife Protection Act, making their killing a punishable offence. By declaring them as vermin and including them in Schedule 5, farmers and other persons can kill the animals posing a menace to crops and lives.

20 November 2021||November 20 2021 00:00 IST,KERALA||Hardly anything goes right||Right from his first film, Jibu Jacob seemed to be on the lookout for that perfect balance between a family drama and a political commentary.    Vellimoonga , his debut work, managed to hit the right spot many a time, in what was an enjoyable political satire, although the making style was still somewhat old school. Take the light-heartedness, humour, and engaging script out of that film, and you would be left with Ellam Sheriyakum , Jibu’s latest offering. Political potboiler Raising hopes of a political potboiler, the opening sequence is set on the night before the counting of votes of an important Assembly election. The party workers are all milling about at the house of K.C. Chacko (Siddique), who is projected to be the Chief Minister. That night, his daughter Ancy (Rajeesha Vijayan) elopes with Vineeth (Asif Ali), youth leader of the opposing Left party. Much of the film is set around three years after this event, when an intense wish swells up in Ancy as well as her mother to set things right within the family, although Chacko remains obstinate. Lack of creativity Weaved around this is the political drama, which draws a lot from political events in recent years in Kerala. But, much of the political part of the story shows the lack of creativity on the part of the writers, who have chosen to retain many of the real world happenings as it is with slight changes, rather than using these sparingly. Not much effort has been taken in fleshing out the characters or the story. No conflict or that matter, there is not even a major conflict worth resolving in the film, or something which would keep the audience hooked with anticipation. The flashback part, as if in compensation for Vineeth’s subdued behaviour at present, also does not evoke much of an interest. A reference to a much-discussed case of honour killing in the State is also thrown in, but it fails to create any impact, for the characters involved here appear on the screen a few minutes before the scene, leaving not even enough time for the viewers to register their presence. Towards the middle, the script gives Vineeth something to worry about, in Ancy’s supposedly indifferent behaviour after getting closer to her family, but even this turns out to be more a figment of his imagination, rather than that of the scriptwriters. This time around, despite the huge doses of hope that the title of the movie gives, Jibu Jacob gets hardly anything right. S.R. Praveen  Take the light-heartedness, humour, and engaging script out of Vell imoonga , and you would be left with Ellam Sheriyakum .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hardly-anything-goes-right/article37591428.ece
20 November 2021||November 20 2021 00:00 IST,KERALA||A decisive victory for agitating farmers: CM||Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) leader Elamaram Kareem, MP, said the Narendra Modi Government had retreated before the wrath of farmers. The Kissan Samyuktha Morcha-led agitation had brought the fascist BJP regime to its knees. The BJP withdrew the market-friendly and pro-corporate farm laws to save itself from a rout in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh and Uttarkhand Assembly polls. Communist Party of India State secretary Kanam Rajendran said Mr. Modi had muscled the black laws through the Lok Sabha to favour his “corporate allies”. However, the farmers had defeated his neo-liberal pitch. Farmers had braved the COVID-19 pandemic, attacks from Sangh Parivar goons and harsh weather to author the iconic victory. They fought overwhelming forces and still carried the day. In many ways, the agitation was reminiscent of the Independence struggle. Forward Bloc general secretary G. Devarajan said wisdom had dawned later on the BJP Government. Torchlight marches Congress workers took out torchlight marches across Kerala to hail the victory of the agitation. Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president K. Sudhakaran said “fascist Modi” had to bow to the collective will of farmers. The Prime Minister had no recourse but to withdraw the black laws or face an electoral rout in the upcoming Assembly elections. Farmers had sounded the death knell of the fascist National Democratic Alliance regime. It was the beginning of the end of the BJP rule at the Centre. The blacks were anti-farmer and pro-corporate. He said Mr. Modi had sacrificed the interests of crores of farmers at the altar of profit-motivated global corporations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-decisive-victory-for-agitating-farmers-cm/article37591472.ece

While a youth, identified as Ranjith, died when the roof of his house at Ganthumarri village in Ramagiri mandal caved in on him while he was asleep, 10 persons had a miraculous escape when they were stranded in the middle of the heavy flow of Chitravathi river at Veldurthi. Three others were injured in house collapse incidents all over the district, while police and fire department personnel rescued seven others in Parigi mandal. The cyclonic storm that turned into a depression and crossed over from the Bay of Bengal to land at 5.30 a.m. on Friday lay centred over Chittoor district, and due to its pull-effect, heavy rain was witnessed all over Anantapur district and southern parts of Kurnool till evening. Collector Nagalakshmi reviewed the situation on Friday morning. At Utukuru, a village in Parigi mandal, five youth, who fell in Penna river while taking selfies, were saved by villagers. In the same mandal, two others got washed away in the river at Sasanakota village up to a distance and stayed there clinging on to bushes for a couple of hours until fire and police personnel came to their rescue. In Anantapur city, which has seen incessant rain for the last 36 hours, an old woman was injured after a tiled house collapsed in the early hours. The woman, Anasuyamma(62) was asleep when the roof of her house in Raninagar collapsed. She was shifted to hospital for head injuries. In yet another incident, a woman and her son were injured at Kadavakallu village in Putlur mandal when their house collapsed. Water enters Kadiri temple As the Maddileru rivulet overflowed, several streets in Kadiri were flooded, making it difficult for residents to come out. Rainwater gushed into the Narasimha Swamy temple as well. There were also reports of corpses from a nearby burial ground floating in Pushkarni in the town due to the force of the water. Communication between Anantapur and Kadapa district was snapped as streams were overflowing at several places on the State Highways.

20 November 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||IAF chopper rescues 10 persons from Chitravathi||An Indian Air Force helicopter from Yelahanka in Bengaluru rescued 10 persons stranded in the middle of Chitravathi river, at Veldurthy village in Chennekothapalli mandal of Anantapur district, on Friday. A car with four passengers was stuck in the middle of the river at 4 a.m. owing to heavy flow of water, and Dharmavaram Deputy Superintendent of Police Ramakanth took the help of a local earthmover and Fire Department personnel, and tried to rescue them by bringing them on to the earthmover. As soon as the earthmover began its 250-metre journey back to the river bund, heavy inflows from the upper reaches made it impossible for it to move and it was on the verge of getting washed away. There were four passengers of the car, two Fire Department personnel and four other local swimmers along with the earthmover operator on the vehicle. District Collector Nagalakshmi Selvarajan along with Superintendent of Police Fakkeerappa Kaginelli immediately contacted the DGP, and Rapthadu MLA Thopudurthi Prakash Reddy, who in turn got in touch with Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy for help. The Chief Minister got in touch with the Indian Navy officers at Visakhapatnam, but due to inclement weather and distance, the Indian Air Force at Yelahanka was contacted and a Mi-17-IV helicopter was for the rescue operation. The helicopter reached the spot at 1.40 p.m. and took about an hour to rescue all the 10 persons stranded on the earthmover, which was shaking due to the ever-increasing force of the floodwater. While seven crew members of the IAF toiled hard to rescue the 10 persons, families of those stranded spent an anxious day on the shore and lustily cheered every time one person was lifted up into the chopper from the vvehicle. Mr. Fakkeerappa said it was a satisfying joint operation as all the lives could be saved and thanked the IAF Yelahanka team for their timely help.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/iaf-chopper-rescues-10-persons-from-chitravathi/article37591610.ece
20 November 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Repeal labour code too, urges APCC||APCC president S. Sailajanath has termed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement of withdrawal of the three farm laws as a conditional decision aimed at facing the elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. While the Centre’s decision to enact the farm laws was flawed, the latest announcement should be seen as a victory of the farmers and farm labourers, Mr. Sailajanath told The Hindu on Friday. “Had the BJP been pro-farmer, it would be repealed the laws unconditionally and desisted from constituting a commission to look into the MSP for the farm produce,” the Congress leader said. In such a backdrop, the farmers’ decision to continue their strike despite the Prime Minister’s announcement was justified, Mr. Sailajanath said, and added that the protesters should watch the developments in Parliament before taking the final decision. Padayatra Meanwhile, CPI(M) district secretary V. Rambhupal welcomed the announcement and termed it a victory of the farmers. He said the Rythu Sangham and the Rythu Coolie Sangham, in association with the CPI(M) and the CITU, would launch a padayatra on Saturday seeking compensation to the farmers of the district for the loss of crops due to excess rains.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/repeal-labour-code-too-urges-apcc/article37591092.ece

20 November 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘30% of Bengaluru’s poorest seek private healthcare’||In the light of disproportionate health vulnerabilities being suffered by the urban poor in India, theAzim Premji University (APU) released a report, ‘Health Care Equity in Urban India’, in collaboration with 17 regional NGOs to combat the problem. “The report explores understanding of health vulnerabilities of urban poor, availability, accessibility and cost of healthcare facilities, and possibilities in future-proofing services in the next decade,” APU said in a statement on Friday. Calling for significant investments in scaling up healthcare facilities and infrastructure in cities, the report found that there is a disproportionate disease burden on the poor, chaotic urban health governance, financial burden on the poor, and urban local bodies are less invested in healthcare. To address these issues, the university and NGOs called for strengthening community participation and governance, building a comprehensive and dynamic database on the health and nutrition status, strengthening healthcare provisioning through the National Urban Health Mission, and policy measures to reduce financial burden on the poor. Among other findings, the report noted that life expectancy among the poorest in urban areas, when compared with the richest, was lower by 9.1 years in case of men and by 6.2 years in women. 10-fold difference in cost Cost-wise, the report observed that evidence from Bengaluru showed that 30% of even the poorest quintile seek healthcare from private sources. Since there is a 10-fold difference in cost between public and private facilities, it significantly adds to their financial burden. The varsity and NGOs pointed out that the 74th Constitutional Amendment, 1992 mandated a central role for urban local bodies to be invested in healthcare.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/30-of-bengalurus-poorest-seek-private-healthcare/article37590842.ece

20 November 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Farmers will throw TRS govt. out’||Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president A. Revanth Reddy has said that Telangana farmers were inspired with the victory of the farming community that forced the Modi government to repeal the three farm laws and was ready to throw out the TRS government now for its failure to procure paddy. Mr. Reddy, who visited the threshing yards of paddy farmers in Nizamabad district as a part of the party’s “Kallallo Congress” on Friday interacted with the farmers, said Modi government repealing the farm laws was a morale boosters for Telangana farmers to fight for their rights. Congress would support them as it did at the national-level against the farm laws. The farmers explained how they were pushed into financial distress with the crop loss due to recent heavy rains. Farmers said that they had brought paddy to the procurement centres 15 days ago but the officials were yet to procure. Meanwhile, heavy rains spoiled the produce. Farmers also explained the difficulties they have been facing due to uncertainty over paddy cultivation. Many farmers complained of non-payment of MSP for their produce while a few complained about the huge rise in input cost due to the increase in prices of diesel. Accompanied by former minister Mohammed Ali Shabbir, DCC presidents and other leaders, Mr. Revanth Reddu interacted with farmers in Baswapur, Rameshwarpally, Jangampally, Bhiknoor Town, Kamareddy Town, Bhavanipet, Palvancha, Tadvai, Lingampet, Lingampalli, Nalla Madugu and Shettali Sangareddy. The team met the family of farmer Beeraiah in Ailapur village of Lingampet, who recently died of a heart attack on his paddy field. They also met the family of another farmer Mettu Prabhakar of Nalla Madugu village, who died due to a snake bike. Financial assistance was given to both the families on behalf of the Congress party. Speaking to media persons later, Mr. Revanth Reddy alleged that farmers in Telangana were in deep distress due to the negligent attitude of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. . Mr. Reddy announced that the party would raise the issues concerning farmers of Telangana in the forthcoming session of Parliament unlike the ‘drama’ of the Chief Minister at Indira Park. Shabbir Ali said KCR should seek an appointment with the Prime Minister to discuss procurement. If he was unable to convince the Centre, he must resign.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/farmers-will-throw-trs-govt-out/article37591410.ece
20 November 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Centre yet to act on KCR’s deadline||The Centre remained unmoved even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced repeal of farm laws on day one after Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao set a two-day deadline to it to respond to the dharna by him and his Cabinet colleagues demanding procurement of boiled rice produced in ensuing rabi from the State. But, official sources of the Ministry of Food and Public Distribution System have already confirmed, off the record, that only raw rice produced from just concluded kharif alone would be procured henceforth. The Food Corporation of India will not be given permission to procure boiled rice that is produced in rabi because it has these stocks that were sufficient to meet the country’s requirement for four years. The sources circulated a note that said the FCI procured both raw rice of kharif and boiled rice of rabi from the State in excess of the fixed targets in all seasons from 2016-17 to kharif of 2020-21. It was only in rabi of 2021-21 that the procurement of boiled rice was restricted due to a mismatch in production and consumption levels. Though only 24.75 lakh tonnes was set for procurement in that season, the FCI was permitted to lift another 20 lakh tonnes as a one-time concession on the request of the Chief Minister. The Telangana government also agreed in writing not to ask FCI to buy any more boiled rice and instead use the stocks to promote rice bran oil mills by incentivising them. As of October 11, the FCI had boiled rice stock of 46.28 lakh tonnes and another 32.73 lakh tonnes was yet to reach its godowns. With a storage of 79 lakh tonnes thus, the FCI had stocks to meet the requirements of boiled rice consuming States for four years. The annual consumption in these States was only 20 lakh tonnes. Also, the boiled rice consuming States have stepped up their own production which has slowed down movement of stocks from FCI godowns. On the other hand, Telangana produced boiled rice, but consumed raw rice which added to piling up of stocks. Reacting to the demand of the Chief Minister to enhance the target of procurement or raw rice in kharif of 2020-21 from 40 to 90 lakh tonnes, the Ministry officials denied such large quantity as the expected yield was only 54.27 lakh tonnes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/centre-yet-to-act-on-kcrs-deadline/article37590845.ece
20 November 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Repeal of farm laws a victory for Telangana CM: Minister||Welcoming the Central Government’s decision to withdraw the three controversial farm laws, Agriculture Minister S. Niranjan Reddy described the development as a victory of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and the Maha Dharna he staged on Thursday in protest against the Central Government’s attitude towards purchase of paddy from the State. Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Government should realise the fact that the Constitution cast the responsibility of foodgrains’ procurement and distribution on the Central Government. The Prime Minister should accordingly hold discussions with the stakeholders on the modalities that should be adopted for stabilization of agriculture in the country. Simultaneously, efforts should be made to evolve a comprehensive agriculture policy giving guidance to farmers taking into consideration aspects like cropping pattern and demand for the produce in national and international markets. He wondered why the Government which could waive loans to the tune of Rs. 6 lakh crore to corporates was not willing to come to the aid of farmers by putting in place an appropriate policy governing the sector. Recent developments He recalled the developments related to paddy procurement in recent months wherein the Chief Minister himself addressed several communications to the Centre besides personally meeting the Ministers concerned that culminated in the protest demonstration on Thursday. “The development apparently reflects the Central Government’s apprehensions over the consequences in the event of the Chief Minister leading an agitation from the south bringing together all the like-minded forces,” he said adding that Mr. Modi knew fully well about the popularity and capability of Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao. Mr. Niranjan Reddy welcomed the Mr. Modi’s gesture in apologizing to people for bringing in the three laws and said his gesture as Prime Minister of the largest democracy was in line with the decorum of the post he held. The State BJP leaders however were unwilling to accept the facts and some of these leaders were still claiming that people did not understand the legislations properly. “The Congress has initiated the process for agricultural laws and the BJP government tried for their implementation. The Congress on its part should be ashamed that it has incorporated these legislations in its election manifesto in 2019 and it has no role in the sustained agitation carried out by the farmers,” he said. The Centre’s decision to rescind the legislations was a victory of the farmers who sacrificed their lives in the fight against the “black laws”. The Government should tender apologies to their families and announce appropriate compensation for the families of the deceased,” he said. At the same time, the “self-claimed intellectuals” who supported these laws owed an explanation and apology to the people of the country, he said adding these persons should be ashamed of themselves for misleading the people. The Minister favoured changes in the agriculture sector so as to attract youth into the profession while the Centre should take steps to purchase paddy from Telangana. Steps should be taken at the Central level to encourage paddy cultivation in Telangana and the Prime Minister should himself intervene in the matter of paddy purchase to resolve the ongoing stalemate. Minister A. Indrakaran Reddy said the Centre was forced to withdraw the legislations due to the sustained democratic struggle by farmers while the Maha Dharna staged by the Chief Minister too had its impact on the development. He reiterated that the Telangana Rashtra Samithi government was committed to the cause of farmers and would continue its struggle to ensure that farmers received their due.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/repeal-of-farm-laws-a-victory-for-telangana-cm-minister/article37590843.ece
20 November 2021||KADAPA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Eight persons washed away in Kadapa||Eight persons were reported dead and 50 others are reported missing after they were washed away in gushing waters after the Annamayya project breached near Rajampeta on Friday. Most of the victims were passengers of two RTC buses caught in the floodwaters on the road down the reservoir zone. According to information, the Annamayya project, constructed in 1978, was getting heavy inflows from the Bahuda river, after the Pincha project suffered damage near Rayachoti in the district. It was said that the project received an inflow of 3.25 lakh cusecs of floodwater, as against its capacity of 1.40 lakh cusecs. The impact was such that a concrete bund to a length of 336 metres was washed away in the morning. The railway track on the Chennai-Mumbai section was washed away for several metres before the gushing waters through the Cheyyeru river entered the road point nearby. Three buses were immediately surrounded by the floodwaters. By the time the rescue teams from Rajampeta and Kadapa divisions arrived at the spot, the buses were completely marooned. It is believed that about 30 passengers had gone missing. After five-hour-long rescue operation, about 20 passengers were rescued by evening. The rescue teams found eight dead bodies, four each at Ramapuram and Mandapally villages. Unconfirmed reports said that another four bodies were found. A revenue official said that rescue operation, which was continuing, was hampered due to 360-degree flooding and thick growth of thorns, coupled with engulfing darkness and an uncontrollable flow of water. A helicopter was deployed as part of the mission in the evening. It is reported that the flooding of the Cheyyeru river due to a breach of the Annamayya project had cut off links to a dozen villages. The damage of the Tirupati-Kadapa national highway further adversely impacted the rescue operations. The identification of the deceased had also turned a big task. Rajampeta MLA Meda Mallikarjun Reddy told the media that about 30 people were feared washed away in the Cheyyeru flood fury. He said that apart from NDRF and SDRF teams, the entire police and revenue machinery was monitoring the rescue operation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/8-dead-as-annamayya-project-breaches/article37591081.ece

20 November 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Globetrotting Kerala tea-seller no more||K.R. Vijayan, who shot into the limelight for his travels around the world along with wife, Mohana, using the savings from their small tea shop here, died of a heart attack on Friday. The couple had returned from a trip to Russia just over a fortnight ago. He was 71. He was planning his next trip to Japan and his wish list also included Vietnam and Cambodia. The globetrotting tea-seller couple had visited 26 countries across six continents in the past 14 years and was featured in the national and international media. Their tea shop next to Salim Rajan Road in Kochi is adorned with photographs from their many foreign trips. Maiden trip in 2007 The couple started travelling with a trip to Egypt in 2007. They initially raised the required funds through bank loans, which they repaid from their daily savings of as little as Rs. 300 from the tea shop. But, as the number of trips increased, so did the loans. However, as their fame spread, they started getting sponsors and they no longer had to pay for their travels. The couple’s trips to Australia, New Zealand and Russia were sponsored. Brand ambassador Mr. Vijayan, who considered life as countless journeys strung together, also had a trip to Singapore lined up to inaugurate the office of a travel agency of which he was the brand ambassador. Last year, the couple brought out a book titled Chaaya Vittu Vijayanteyum Mohanayudeyum Loka Sancharangal , which loosely translates to ‘The global tours of Vijayan and Mohana by selling tea’. The Tourism Department paid tributes to Mr. Vijayan by sharing his picture on twitter, calling him an “intrepid traveller who embarked on his final journey”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/globetrotting-kerala-tea-seller-no-more/article37590847.ece
20 November 2021||Kozhikode,ANDHRA PRADESH||Kerala picks Kinalur to set up AIIMS||The State Government has reportedly decided to establish the proposed All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) for Kerala at Kinalur, near Balussery, in Kozhikode district. Already 150 acres of unused land is in the possession of the Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation on the Kinalur Industrial Estate. The Government has now notified that it would acquire another 100 acres for the purpose. The District Collector has been tasked to look into the acquisition process. Earlier, a three-member committee chaired by Principal Health Secretary Rajan N. Khobragade had given a favourable report that the site is ideal for setting up AIIMS after visiting Kinalur in August. Health Minister Veena George will visit the site on Saturday. However, a final decision on the proposal will be taken after a team of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare inspected the location, about 25 km from Kozhikode city, on the Koyilandy-Thamarassery-Edavanna State Highway. Infra, other facilities If the proposal become a reality, Kinalur would become an national-level hub for treatment facilities, studies and medical research. The State has assured the Centre that the location would be provided with infrastructure and transportation facilities and other utility services including power and water connections. It already has a substation of the Kerala State Electricity Board and is linked by the Japan-aided drinking water scheme. A few years ago, the Government had identified four locations: the open jail compound at Nettukaltheri Thiruvananthapuram district, land at Kinalur, land belonging to the Government Medical College at Kottayam, and the HMT land at Kalamassery in Ernakulam district. This was following the announcement of the first Narendra Modi Ministry to establish AIIMS-like institutes in 10 States in 2014. Currently, Kerala is the only major State in the country that does not figure on the list of AIIMS under the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) scheme. Officials said the proposed AIIMS at Kinalur would cater to the needs of people of six districts in north Kerala. Outpatient facilities could be started in the first phase and MBBS and postgraduate courses in a phased manner. This part, hundreds of job opportunities will be created with the establishment of the new medical institute.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kerala-picks-kinalur-to-set-up-aiims/article37591043.ece
20 November 2021||Mangaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Karnataka border district allows buses to Kerala||The Dakshina Kannada district administration has allowed operations of inter-State Road Transport Corporation (RTC) buses between Kerala and Dakshina Kannada that had been suspended over COVID-19 pandemic. DK Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra, in his order of Wednesday that was released to the media on Friday, said only RTCs of the respective States could operate the inter-State services. The Hindu on Tuesday highlighted the plight of students and other regular travellers while changing buses on the Kerala-Karnataka border at Talapady for non operation of interstate services. Dr. Rajendra said possessing a RT-PCR certificate and complete vaccination certificate were mandatory for bus passengers. Daily travellers have to furnish a RT-PCR negative certificate once a week. The DC said the relaxation was being offered in view of opening up of all sectors and resumption of physical classes for students. There has been widespread demand to restore direct buses between Dakshina Kannada and Kasaragod districts, he added. Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation’s Mangaluru division on Friday operated 16 buses at an interval of every six minutes between Mangaluru and Kasaragod. Kerala SRTC operated 23 buses at an interval of every six minutes, said a KSRTC official. Prior to COVID-19 travel curbs, Karnataka SRTC operated a total of 35 buses doing five single trip each while Kerala SRTC with 33 buses also did five single trip for each bus. Karnataka SRTC’s Puttur division, which had deployed 25 buses towards Kerala, too resumed operations on Friday. Railways however is yet to resume passenger train services in the region thereby forcing students and the public from border areas of Kasaragod district to incur hefty travel expenditure. Students, who would have travelled by paying a maximum of Rs. 30 for two-way by trains between border towns of Kerala to Mangaluru, would have to shell out more than Rs. 100 for travel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/karnataka-border-district-allows-buses-to-kerala/article37591037.ece
20 November 2021||NELLORE,ANDHRA PRADESH||People moved to shelters as Penna is in spate||A huge 5.31 lakh cusecs of water was discharged by lifting 11 gates of Somasila reservoir as Penna river was in spate following heavy rains in the catchment areas in the neighbourng YSR Kadapa district. Two units each of the National Disaster Response Force and State Disaster Response Force were rushed to the flood-affected parts to rescue stranded people as the inflow into the reservoir remained high at 5.56 lakh cusecs on Friday morning. However, the inflow came down to little over 5 lakh cusecs in the evening. The district administration heaved a relief with rains abating in the wake of the depression weakening into a well-marked low pressure after crossing the coast. “We are on high alert and closely watching the flood situation in Penna,” District Collector K.V.N. Chakradhar Babu said overseeing the relief operations along with Special Officer B. Rajasekhar deputed by the State Government. Only four mandals in the district now had over 10 mm rainfall, the District Collector said. No untoward incidents had been reported from anywhere in the district so far, he added. The Swarnamukhi river, which was also in spate carrying over 60,000 cusecs of water from neighbouring Chittoor district, kept the district administration on tenterhooks. The irrigation authorities maintained a flood cushion of 7.95 tmcft in the Somasila reservoir with a 78 tmcft capacity in the wake of the unabated rains in the catchment areas. Flood waters overflowed over some places including on the arterial Chennai-Kolkata national highway near Gudur. However, the officials intervened and ensured smooth flow of vehiclar traffic. The Nellore-Budvel highway was flooded following the heavy discharge from Somasila reservoir. Police personnel led by Nellore Superintendent of Police Ch.Vijaya Rao rescued the stranded people in Sangam and Atmakur mandals. As many as 1,950 people were moved to 13 relief camps set up by the district administration. Standing crops in 8738 hectares, including paddy in 5,173 hectares, were damaged, according to a preliminary report compiled by the Agriculture department. Paddy nurseries raised in 2872.58 hectares were also damaged. The affected farmers would be provided subsidised seeds after a detailed survey of the damage to crops caused by the rains.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/people-moved-to-relief-camps-as-penna-is-in-spate/article37591602.ece
20 November 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Rollback of farm laws a partial victory for farmers, says CPI(M) leader||Communist Party of India (Marxist) Polit Bureau member B.V. Raghavulu has termed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to repeal the three farm laws as a victory for the prolonged struggle by the farmers. “Political exigency is the reason behind the decision of the Centre to roll back the laws, ahead of Assembly elections in five States including Uttar Pradesh. Its drubbing in the recent bypolls in some States also contributed to the decision,” Mr. Raghavulu said. “If the Narendra Modi government is sincere, it should reverse several of its anti-people decisions on various issues including the Citizenship Amendment Act and scrapping of Article 370 which evoked strong opposition from the people,” Mr. Raghavulu added. The CPI(M) would back the struggle by farmers for providing statutory backing to the Minimum Support Price (MSP) regime. The Centre should give up its move to amend the Electricity Act to phase out power subsidies to the farm sector, said the CPI(M) leader who took part in the party’s Prakasam district plenary presided by district secretary P. Anjaneyulu. There can be no justification for continuing with the new labour code which was stoutly opposed by all Central trade unions including the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, affiliated to Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, he said, urging the YSRCP government in the State to roll back its capital trifurcation decision which is being vehemently opposed by Amaravati farmers. He also opposed the Jagan Mohan Reddy government’s decision to withdraw grant-in aid to educational institutions as the same would lead to closure of such institutions or result in students being forced to cough up high tuition fees. In Prakasam district, jubilant farmer leaders on Friday welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement to repeal the three controversial farm laws. Samukyta Kisan Morcha Prakasam district convenor Ch. Ranga Rao termed the Centre’s decision a “partial victory” for the farmers’ year-long struggle. Thanking the Prime Minister for apologising to the farmers, he said their stir for statutory backing to the Minimum Support Price(MSP) regime would continue with vigour. Fair deal to farmers could be ensured only when the formula evolved by noted agriculture scientist M.S. Swaminathan to make farming remunerative was given effect to, he opined. Acharya N.G. Ranga Kisan Samastha Secretary Ch. Seshaiah said no conditions should be imposed during the winter session of Parliament while giving effect to the process of the repeal of three farm laws.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rollback-of-farm-laws-a-partial-victory-for-farmers-says-cpim-leader/article37591603.ece
20 November 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Amaravati farmers welcome Prime Minister’s decision on farm laws||Welcoming Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement to withdraw the three controversial farm laws, Amaravati Parirakshana Samiti co-convener G. Tirupati Rao on Friday urged Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to follow suit and withdraw the Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) Repeal Act. The farmers from Amaravati suspended their ongoing ‘maha padayatra’ against shifting the capital for the second day on Friday due to unabated rains. The farmers were of the view that the Union and State governments should evolve policies and programmes that fulfil the aspirations of the people and not enact any piece of legislation that went against the larger interests of the people. “In such a situation, those in power will have no option but to retract in the wake of the prolonged people’s struggles,” Mr. Rao said. The YSRCP government too had no option but to scrap the CRDA Repeal Act in the wake of the struggle of the farmers from the Amaravati capital region, he added. “The State government should give up its adamant stand and revoke its decision to establish three capitals. It should develop Amaravati as the sole capital of the State,” he said. Welcoming the BJP’s support to their walkathon, the farmers, who camped at Gudlur in Prakasam district on Friday, wanted the Prime Minister, who had laid the stone for a world-class capital in Amaravati, to intervene and ensure justice for them too. The padayatra would resume from Gudlur on Saturday and enter Nellore district near Rajuvari Chintalapalem. Power subsidy Meanwhile, All India Kisan Sabha Prakasam district secretary Vadde Hanuma Reddy demanded that the Centre drop its proposed amendment to the Electricity Act to phase out power subsidy to the farm sector and drop Union Minister Ajay Mishra from the Cabinet in the wake of the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in U.P.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/amaravati-farmers-welcome-prime-ministers-decision-on-farm-laws/article37591616.ece
20 November 2021||PALAKKAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Debate over ‘sir’, ‘madam’ reaches Kerala rights panel||The Kerala State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) has filed a case in connection with the ongoing debate over the issue of using the salutation ‘sir’ and ‘madam.’ The SHRC has registered the case following a complaint by rights activist Boban Mattumantha, who is in the forefront of a campaign against the use of expressions from the colonial period to address those in governance. Several local bodies across the State came forward to drop the use of ‘sir’ and ‘madam’ as part of the campaign. Mr. Mattumantha approached the SHRC in the wake of a reply he got from the Additional Chief Secretary, Personnel and Administrative Reforms, confirming ‘sir’ and ‘madam’ as mere words of respect. The official said ‘sir’ and ‘madam’ were being used extensively as terms of respect among people, including in government offices. However, Mr. Mattumantha questioned the Government argument saying government employees rarely address people approaching them for various purposes using ‘sir’ and ‘madam’ and instead the former expect the people to address them using ‘sir’ and ‘madam.’ “This is against the ethos of democracy enshrined in our Constitution. We are still following the colonial culture left behind by the British even 74 years after we secured freedom,” he said. In his complaint to the SHRC, Mr. Mattumantha pointed out that people’s representatives, including Ministers, MPs and MLAs, were rarely using the term ‘sir’ and ‘madam’ when writing to or addressing their counterparts. “Our Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan wrote to his Tamil Nadu counterpart addressing him as ‘Stalin ji’ and to Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressing him as ‘Modi ji’ ,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/debate-over-sir-madam-reaches-kerala-rights-panel/article37591038.ece

20 November 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Finger of blame in Viveka murder case points at TDP’||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Friday said that slain former MP Y.S. Vivekananda Reddy was a paternal uncle for him and Kadapa MP Y.S. Avinash Reddy, and sought to know why anyone would kill his or her family member. “In fact, TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu had created doubts in the minds of the people that someone very close to the slain MP or myself might have abetted the crime, to derive political mileage,” Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy alleged in the Legislative Assembly. The Chief Minister was responding to the allegation made by Mr. Naidu that his family was being dragged into the political muddle and that his wife, who had been with him through the thick and thin of politics, was not spared. Vivekananda Reddy’s murder had been committed when Mr. Naidu was the Chief Minister, and, therefore, the finger of blame points at the TDP leaders, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said. The TDP had hatched several conspiracies to defeat Vivekananda Reddy in the MLC elections and succeeded in spite of the YSRCP’s domination, the Chief Minister alleged. ‘Naidu twisting facts’ “Mr. Naidu is twisting facts and desperately trying to drive a wedge among my family members by planting the seed of suspicion in my uncle’s murder. Whatever he does, God is watching,” Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said. Denying that the YSRCP MLAs made disparaging comments on Mr. Naidu’s family, the Chief Minister said they were only giving a retort to certain allegations made by the Leader of the Opposition. He said the ruling party MLAs were insisting that if Mr. Naidu wanted a discussion on the charges he had been levelling against the Chief Minister, he should be prepared for a debate on the murder of Vangaveeti Mohan Ranga and A. Madhava Reddy, and the suicide of Mallela Babji too. But, in a knee-jerk reaction, Mr. Naidu said his family was being targeted to earn sympathy. The Chief Minister said that Mr. Naidu and his party MLAs should have made constructive suggestions in the Assembly when a serious debate was taking place on the issues related to the agriculture sector, but what happened was unfortunate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jagan-denies-allegations/article37591036.ece

Of this, six lakh MT would be procured during Kharif and 9.60 lakh MT would be procured during the Rabi season. The Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution had launched a programme for distribution of fortified rice having three micronutrients — folic acid, iron and vitamin B-12 — to children and lactating mothers.

20 November 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||3 capitals petition ought to have been heard in first instance: CJ||Chief Justice of the Andhra Pradesh High Court Prashant Kumar Mishra observed on Friday that a petition filed by MLC P. Ashok Babu against the A.P. Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions and the CRDA Repeal Acts ought to have been heard in the first instance given their consequences for the State. Had it been taken up at that early stage, the burden on the court would have reduced, Mr. Justice Mishra said during the hearing on the impugned legislations. Appearing for the petitioner, senior advocate Jandhyala Ravi Shankar argued that the passage of the Bills in the Assembly after the same were referred to a select committee by the Legislative Council Chairman for the sake of eliciting public opinion within six months smacked of a “fraud on the Constitution and democracy.” He insisted that the Bills should have been signed by both the Assembly Speaker and the Council Chairman, and that wherever the word ‘Speaker’ was mentioned, it should be read as Chairman (of the Council) also. He further said that if the Bills were not considered at every stage, a parliamentary debate would have no meaning, and that the Council had its due weightage as per a judgment of the constitutional bench of the Supreme Court. Mr. Ravi Shankar said reintroduction of the Bills in the Assembly before the select committee concluded its proceedings was itself violative of the Constitution. He also said the Advocate-General had made a statement in the High Court that the Bills were sent to the select committee, whereas no attempt had apparently been made either by the Legislature Secretary or the government to let the committee fulfil its mandate. Even before these procedures were complied with, the Bills were sent for assent of the Governor, whose office remained silent on a letter purportedly written by the Council Chairman on the alleged inaction of the Legislature Secretary with regard to the forming of a select committee, the terms of reference and its functioning.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/3-capitals-petition-ought-to-have-been-heard-in-first-instance-cj/article37591608.ece

20 November 2021||Visakhapatnam,ANDHRA PRADESH||AIIEA, VUPPC hail repeal of farm laws||The All India Insurance Employees’ Association (AIIEA) has welcomed the announcement by the Prime Minister on repeal of the three farm laws. In a statement on Friday, AIIEA general secretary Shreekanth Mishra said that the laws were seen by them as steps towards corporatisation of agriculture. There were genuine fears that the move would not only place the farmers at the mercy of big corporations but would also deprive them of their livelihood. The farmers were also aggrieved that these laws were framed without any consultation with the farming community, and pushed in Parliament without any discussion. The nation has witnessed large-scale protests against these laws for the last one year. Such a long-drawn protest involving a very large section of the people raised questions over democracy as people’s involvement in governance, he said. In the last one year hundreds of lives were lost and the economy was impacted badly. Had the government shown some flexibility, the issue could have been resolved much earlier avoiding the loss of precious lives, he said. The struggle of the farmers was not just about the three farm laws. The protests raised certain important issues relating to the life and living of the farmers and the national economy as well. The protests are also about asking the government to take steps to make agriculture remunerative. With more than 50% of the workforce in the country dependent on agriculture for a living, the country cannot progress without addressing their genuine grievances over remunerative prices for their produce and enhancement of their living standards, he said. Mr. Misha said the AIIEA was hopeful that the government would take the initiative to hold discussions for a peaceful resolution of all the issues raised by the farmers’ struggle. The AIIEA congratulated the Samyukt Kisan Morcha and all the farmers on the success of their agitation. Meanwhile, the relay hunger strikes being organised by workers of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP), under the aegis of Visakha Ukku Parirakshana Porata Committee (VUPPC) continued for the 281st day on Friday. ‘People losing trust’ VUPPC representative J. Simhachalam commended the farmers on their success in the long-drawn struggles against the farm laws. Though the Prime Minister had announced repeal of the farm laws, they were not ready to believe him. This shows that Mr. Narendra Modi was losing the trust of the people, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/aiiea-vuppc-hail-repeal-of-farm-laws/article37591713.ece

Addressing the participants , party State secretariat member Ch. Narasinga Rao commended the farmers for their united struggles, which compelled the BJP government for a rethink on its decision. He recalled that the Union government had brought out the farm laws last year, which were against the interests of farmers . Farmers all over the country, with the support of industrial workers, have been agitating for nearly one year. The struggle had forced the Prime Minister to announce withdrawal of the ‘anti-farmer’ laws and expressing his apologies to the farmers, he said. He demanded that the BJP government implement the M.S. Swaminathan Commission recommendations and provide remunerative prices to farmers for their produce. Party city secretary M. Jaggu Naidu described the farmers struggle as the ‘biggest struggle’ after the ‘struggle for Independence’. He warned that if the BJP government continued to bring anti-people laws, taking advantage of its strength in Parliament, it would have to face defeat. He said it was the responsibility of the people to continue the struggle in the same spirit till the BJP government withdrew its decision on privatisation of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) and abolished the four Labour Codes and withdrew the decision on privatisation of other PSUs. Rythu Sangham district president Gandi Nayana Babu, 78th Ward Corporator B. Ganga Rao, CITU city president R.K.S.V. Kumar, CITU district secretary G. Koteswara Rao and leaders Y.

He said that the farmers had refused to give up their struggle till an announcement was made in the winter session of Parliament. They were also demanding payment of compensation to the farmers, who had died during the agitation. He also demanded that the BJP government also come out with a statement on continuation of the VSP in the public sector. Party city secretary M. Pydiraju, assistant secretary SK Rehaman, party leaders A. Vimala and K. Satyanarayana were among those who participated.

He said that creating awareness among all sections of the people on the anti-people policies of the BJP government could help in saving PSUs, keeping prices under control and protecting democratic rights.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/repeal-of-farm-laws-left-parties-take-out-victory-rallies/article37591662.ece

Speaking on the occasion, State Industries Minister Mekapati Goutham Reddy said creation of the Andhra Pradesh Airports Development Corporation Ltd., a Special Purpose Vehicle, was aimed at facilitating speedy implementation of the aviation plan, ensuring connectivity through road, rail and, possibly, sea via ports in close proximity, and building multi-model cargo hubs to drive industrial and economic development. He said that of the seven airports in Andhra Pradesh, five were under the jurisdiction of the Airports Authority of India (AAI). One in Kurnool was being operated by the APADCL and the one in Puttaparti was under the Sri Sathya Sai Central Trust. The airstrips in Prakasam district being constructed by the AAI were expected to be operational by 2022, he said. Of the five AAI airports, the ones in Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada and Tirupati were international airports, he said. The domestic airports in Rajamahendravaram and Kadapa had witnessed more than 5 million passenger traffic and handled cargo of around 12,135 MT in 2019-20, but the business went down in 2020-21 due to COVID-19. Development of Aerospace and Defence manufacturing facilities was another thrust area, Mr. Reddy said, listing the upcoming A&D facilities in the State, including the Mishra Dhatu Nigam Limited’s greenfield aluminium alloy production plant at Bodduvaripalem in Nellore district; Advanced Night Vision devices project at BEL, Nimmakuru, Krishna district; Missile Integration Facility at BEL, Palasamudram, in Anantapur; Very Low Frequency transmission facility by the Indian Navy in Prakasam district; helicopter training facility by the Air Force at Donakonda in Prakasam district; and a cyber security operations centre in Visakhapatnam by the DRDO.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/scindia-lauds-state-for-slashing-aviation-fuel-tax/article37591709.ece

The brochures have been brought out to buttress the State-owned coal company’s efforts to foster safety awareness among the coal miners and ensure effective implementation of the SMPs in all its coal mines by actively involving the safety committee members, sources said. The recent roof collapse incident in the SRP 3 & 3A incline underground mine in Mancherial district, which claimed the lives of four coal miners, has yet again turned the spotlight on mine safety. The company’s safety wing has been periodically organising training programmes for the safety committee members and also providing personal protective equipment such as safety lamps, helmets, gloves and goggles to the coal workers as per the statutory provisions. Various trade unions affiliated to the central trade unions have been consistent in their demand for renewed focus on safety of coal miners alongside implementing the growth strategies for enhancing productivity and preventing mine accidents.

20 November 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Preserving Dhokra art with skill development, and tech||With the aim of training the younger generations of Ojha community in the traditional Dhokra art form, one of the earliest known methods of non-ferrous metal casting, a team at the Indian Institute of Technology-Hyderabad (IIT-H), conducted a design intervention workshop. Led by professor Deepak John Mathew of the institute’s department of Design, the workshop was held for Ojha Gonds of Adilabad as a part of an ongoing project, “Tangible and Intangible Cultural Heritage of Telangana” supported by Science and Heritage Research Initiative Programme, Design Innovation Centre, and Institutional Innovation Centre. Traditionally, Dhokra artifacts were majorly created for ritualistic purposes of the Raj Gonds. The workshop aimed at retaining and sustaining the traditional craft practices of the Ojhas and to provide them opportunities to generate livelihood from their ancestral occupation of Dhokra craft-making. It also focussed on community building, peer learning, skill development, and training. Thus, the master craftsman was chosen from Ojha community itself. Digital repository One more aspect of the workshop was to create a digital repository of all the artifacts created at the workshop by using photogrammetry and 3D digital printing, which would be useful for researchers for further studies as well as for patrons from all over the world to get insights in the cultural heritage of the Raj Gonds as well as associated communities and their traditional practices. The digital museum would be an extension of the workshop to preserve the traditional artifacts with non-destructive methods where the original artifacts will remain with the community and 3D printed artifacts will fulfil the knowledge-sharing purpose on the cultural heritage of Telangana on a global level, where the museum can be visited virtually from anywhere in the world. “We define IIT-H as inventing and innovating in technology for humanity. [We are aiming at] Preserving Dhokra using the design concept and encouraging future generations to sustain it. IIT-H also has a Rural Development Centre to uplift rural livelihood with the aid of technology,” said institute director B.S. Murty. The workshop intended to revive the traditional “Whojari Kala” (art of Ojha community) and encourage younger generations of the Ojha families to adopt the traditional occupation by providing design intervention through the workshop. “It will also facilitate the creation of products that can fulfil the market’s needs. Thus, our traditional crafts can provide sustainable livelihood to the community,” said master craftsman Uika Inderjeet. Speaking about the project, a PhD scholar from the department of Design, Krishna Trivedi said: “Raj Gonds are one of the oldest indigenous communities of India. The Ojha Gonds are associated with the Raj Gonds by providing Dhokra artifacts for ritualistic, utilitarian and decorative needs of the community, which is gradually declining due to the lack of the patronage. With the adaptation of industrial goods, thus, systematic documentation, preservation, and safeguarding of the Ojha’s Dhokra crafts practices is an important need at present.” “The documentation of the traditional process of the metallurgy followed by the Ojhas of Adilabad district is unique and differs from the Dhokra crafts process followed in West Bengal, Bastar, and Odisha. The ancestral practices of the Ojhas are an intangible cultural heritage itself. The workshop gave insights into the detailed process followed in creating the Dhokra artifacts,” said Naquash V, another Ph.D. scholar from the department of Design.  The workshop will facilitate the creation of products that can fulfil the market’s needs. Thus, our traditional crafts can provide sustainable livelihood to the community.

20 November 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Nagara Deepikas help improve municipal solid waste collection||Shamshabad municipality on the capital outskirts has initiated a unique “Micro-Level Monitoring and Awareness Program” for the door-to-door collection and segregation of municipal solid waste by engaging self-help groups (SHGs), Nagara Deepikas, which has helped source segregation of waste from 15% to 75%, besides ensuring cent pent door-to-door collection. Women members of these groups are trained in different aspects of solid waste management such as micro-level monitoring of door-to-door collection, sensitisation of households on source segregation, the importance of not littering on roads and in open places, and against garbage burning, said Director of Municipal Administration N. Satyanarayana on Friday. ‘Nagara Deepikas helped the municipal authorities improve waste collection as well as segregation into wet, dry and hazardous wastes by households, acting as a liaison between the municipality and the citizens, to reduce the gaps in the system within a couple of months of they being pressed into service. Each Nagara Deepika covers around 500 households to counsel them about the waste and road littering while also keeping on eye on the drains overflow and burning of waste. This information is conveyed to the officials concerned on daily basis. Shamshabad municipality has a total of 25 wards and around 13,076 households. A pilot programme was started in 10 wards by appointing 12 Nagara Deepikas for them and this was gradually enhanced to 17 women after noticing the positive impact. Soon, it was taken throughout the town and a spin-off of waste segregation has been that auto-drivers have been earning up to Rs. 300 a day selling the dry waste. ITC-WOW has been providing support to community awareness programmes on source segregation of waste, said said senior officials. The experiment was taken to the Badangpet municipal corporation with 32 wards and around 39,000 households. Here, 64 Nagara Deepikas were appointed and this helped eliminate 82 garbage points, and 100% door-to-door collection was achieved with 80% waste segregation. In fact, 1,600 households have begun home-composting and terrace gardening too, they claimed. Nagaram municipality with 20 wards and 16,000 households followed suit by appointing Nagara Deepikas and training them on source segregation and home-composting. This has helped achieve cent per cent door-to-door collection and 75% source segregation. Dry Resource Collection Centres (DRCCs) have been set up in these urban local bodies for selling the dry waste by autos, and ITC WOW is helping them to market various recyclables. If it was up to 300 kg dry waste being collected before, now in Shamshabad alone - it is about 2,000 kg., 5,000 kg in Badangpet and 1000 kg in Nagaram a day, the officials added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/nagara-deepikas-help-improve-municipal-solid-waste-collection/article37591397.ece

20 November 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Helping disabled animals live their best life||An Ongole cow in Hyderabad with a genetic deformity is all set to receive a pair of new prosthetic limbs. And enabling such animals to live a life of dignity is Krishna Limb. Founded in 2014 by Tapesh Mathur, a veterinarian with vast experience, Krishna Limb has, so far, attended to as many as 120 cases, including disabilities caused due to accidents, from 18 states. Dr Mathur’s team was in the city to take measurements so that the cow can soon have a pair of prosthetic limbs. Measurements can be tricky and the animal has to be gently eased into mobility. “After the animal receives these limbs, it cannot stand on its own, instantly. The length of these limbs have to be increased gradually so that there is muscle movement,” Dr Mathur says, adding that these limbs are made in-house. He explains that he came up with the idea to start Krishna Limb following his experiences as a veterinarian and observations made in a goshala in Rajasthan he happened to visit. “We deal with all kinds of animals — cows, dogs... Basically, these limbs let them live a life of dignity,” he says. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Krishna Limb team did not want work to stop. Therefore, they decided to ask animal owners to send video clips of the animal with disabilities so that they could assess the situation. The Krishna Limb team points out that while they welcome all requests, it is the animal owner’s dedication which is crucial. They have to be eager to take care of the animal. “It is only if they are keen on taking care of the animal that we go ahead. The limb is basically made of a polypropylene sheet. Measurements are tricky and we have to be very careful about it,” Shipra Mathur of Krishna Limb says, adding, “We have been getting a lot of calls from south India.”  Measurements are tricky and we have to be very careful about it...

20 November 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Police officer’s attempts to help accused raises eyebrows||What was a police officer of Hyderabad Commissionerate doing at Raidurg police station, in Cyberabad Commissionerate, when a builder accused of cheating different persons was arrested. The presence of this police officer, who was earlier suspended for his alleged connections with slain gangster Nayeemuddin, at Raidurg police station when the builder was brought there for questioning in a cheating case raised many an eyebrow. Unconfirmed reports said that the officer even attempted to help the builder secure a bail using his good offices. The movements and presence of the police officer, whose friends often boast of his commitment and conviction in discharging duties, became a point of serious discussion in police circles. It is said the police officer was a ‘good friend’ of the builder and hence tried to help him out. Inquiries conducted, unofficially, by some police personnel of Cyberabad indicated that the builder would take help of ‘friends’ to solve problems faced in his real estate deals and other business transactions. Interestingly, it is said the builder has ‘good journalist friends’. One of them works as anchor for a regional news channel and often appears as moderator for political discussions especially connected to Andhra Pradesh. There is no concrete evidence but grapevine has it that this anchor lives in a villa belonging to the builder located in a posh locality of the western part of the city. This police officer and the journalist often turn up at the builder’s office in Gachchibowli and ‘help their friend in sorting out the differences he has with his clients using their good offices’. “How can a serving police officer go to a police station to rescue a person who is facing serious criminal charges,” is the question several police officers are raising during private conversations. Already, the said officer was accused of being in contact with slain gangster Nayeemuddin (when the latter was alive) and his friends. He faced disciplinary action and somehow managed to get back into the job. His presence at the police station and attempts to help out a person facing criminal charges suggest little did he learn from the disciplinary action, say some police officers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/police-officer-attempts-to-help-accused/article37591396.ece

The enterprise, to come up in Gadwal, will generate jobs while also contributing to environmental sustainability. Made from discarded groundnut shells, Biopot, the invention is an eco-friendly alternative to the black plastic bags used in nurseries for growing saplings, T-Works said in a release on the collaboration with the Haier company. In September, T-Works had unveiled the biopress machine it had designed for mass production of the biopots. A live demonstration of the machinery was made on Friday in which volunteers from GE Appliances got hands-on experience of manufacturing biodegradable pots. T-Works said it worked closely with Srija and her mentor Augustien, who had approached the incubator through the Telangana State Innovation Cell (TSIC), and came up with the machine. CEO Sujai Karampuri said “after developing a mechanism to mass produce the biopots, we are now moving a step closer to setting up an industry based on this idea. This is why T-Works exists, to create impact on the ground.” The partnership with GE Appliances is only the beginning of a strong collaboration based on shared values. T-Works will continue to collaborate with corporations, grassroots innovators and ecosystem partners to translate innovation into impact, he said. GE Appliances has decided to support the initiative through the CSR towards setting up a small-scale domestic enterprise for manufacturing biopots in Gadwal district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/t-works-ge-appliances-to-give-wings-to-teenagers-invention/article37591407.ece
20 November 2021||hyderabad,TELANGANA||Civil society members decry cordon and search operations||Cordon and search operations tend to project areas as ‘criminal areas’, are an infringement of privacy, and drug consumption is seen in all classes of society but searches are being done in the relatively ‘lower rung’ of society, a fact-finding committee on the issue has observed. The fact-finding committee comprised activists Surya from Chaitanya Mahila Samakhya, Sajaya, Nikhat Fatima, Sujatha Surepally from Dalit Women Collective, Kaneez Fathima, Jyothi, S Q Masood, and Bilal from Human Rights Forum. In a statement to the media, the committee said said that they visited neighbourhoods which witnessed cordon and search operations and spoke to residents about what ensued during these operations. These neighbourhoods included Chandraiah Huts, Hanumanthu huts and Narsaiah huts, which is a settlement of 236 huts, along the banks of the Musi. A large number of dwellers here, the team said, were Madigas, and a few families belonging to Scheduled Tribes, and Muslims. The committee also interacted with residents of Nawab Sahab Kunta and Teegal Kunta which also saw cordon and search operations. Describing cordon and search as originally a ‘military tactic’ to crack down on insurgents, the committee stated that according to information obtained under the Right to Information Act, the operation is done under section 94 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The committee observed that several women who were living in the areas where cordon and search operations were carried out were confused and frightened with the police presence, especially since they arrived without any prior intimation. They also observed that such operations ‘enable a range of human rights violations, including physical intimidation and assault, invasion of privacy, arbitrary and unlawful detention, collective punishment and destruction of private property’, and underscored that such areas are tend to be projected as ‘criminal areas’. Activists claimed that while drug users are found among people from all ‘classes’, searches and nabbing culprits were being done from the ‘lower rung of the society. Terming cordon and search illegal, the committee demanded that police cease these operations at once. The demand includes an end to seizing of property such as vehicles in the absence of written orders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/civil-society-members-decry-cordon-and-search-operations/article37591416.ece

Sreedhar Rao of Sandhya Convention was arrested by the Raidurg police in Bengaluru two days ago and presented him before a local magistrate in Hyderabad. The magistrate remanded him in judicial custody for 14 days, after police presented details of a series of cases registered against him. The judge told Public Prosecutor Pratap Reddy, appearing for the police, to sensitise police officers on the provisions of Cr.P.C. and the need to adhere to them. Senior counsel M.S. Prasad, appearing for Mr. Rao, said police acted in high-handed manner during the arrest of his client in Bengaluru. Questioning the procedure adopted by Raidurg police in issuing notice under section 41-A of Cr.P.C., the lawyer said the remand report stated that his client rejected such notice issued by the police. Even in case of rejection of notice by a person facing charge, the police had to take permission of the magistrate concerned to arrest the accused, he said. Responding to Mr. Prasad’s contentions, the PP argued that police had no option but to arrest Mr. Rao since he was facing 17 cases involving allegations of cheating civilians. Seeking to know why the police failed to comply with the Cr.P.C. procedures in the arrest of Mr. Rao, the judge recorded that the conduct of Raidurg Inspector made it clear that he was unaware of the criminal procedure code provisions and Supreme Court guidelines on the matter. The judge instructed the Inspector to file counter affidavit over his failure to comply with the procedures.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/high-court-grants-bail/article37591399.ece

He said “The Centre eventually decided to repeal the three detrimental farm laws bowing down to the concerted and collective struggle by farmers.” CPI (M) State committee members P Venkateshwara Rao and Srikanth, district leaders B Sarala and Y Vikram, and a host of other leaders took part in the rally.

20 November 2021||Gurugram,||Amid Sikh group’s opposition, namaz not held at gurdwara||The proposed token Friday prayers (Jumma Namaz) could not be offered at the Sadar gurdwara here after a Sikh group raised objections to “non-Sikh” religious activities inside a gurdwara. In view of the opposition, and rush on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev, Muslim community members decided against the proposed prayers at the gurdwara. However, the namaz was held on the premises offered by Akshay Yadav, a resident of Sector 12A. Altaf Ahmad, co-founder, Gurgaon Muslim Council, said since Thursday members of right-wing groups had been using condemnable tactics to mount pressure on the Committee of Gurdwara to stop Muslims from offering Jumma Namaz at the gurdwara. “Muslims may not have read Jumma Namaz at a physical space of the gurdwara today (on Friday). However, crores of Muslims in India have read namaz sitting in the hearts of the entire Sikh community. We thank our Sikh brothers for this noble gesture of opening their gurdwara for the prayers,” he said. Ravi Ranjan, chairman, Jhatka Authority, held a meeting with members of Shri Guru Singh Sabha, which manages the Sadar gurdwara, during the day on its offer to allow the gurdwara premises for offering of namaz. “I held a meeting with the committee members and made it clear that the gurdwara premises could not be used for ‘non-Sikh’ religious activities. The committee members assured us to hold further discussions on the matter and take a decision,” Mr. Ranjan said. The Sabha’s president, Sherdil Singh Sidhu, who had earlier offered the gurdwara premises for Jumma Namaz, said he was “misquoted” by the media and had no plans as of now to allow namaz inside the gurdwara. “The decision will be taken by the committee if any such request comes up before it,” he said. Meanwhile, Gurgaon Nagrik Ekta Manch, a citizens’ forum, felicitated Mr. Yadav and Mr. Sidhu for their gesture of offering space to Muslims for Friday prayers. The Manch in a letter to them has said that “compassion, love and oneness are the basic tenets of all religions and your effort draws us closer to that truth. Your commitment to this truth shines in this darkness and enables all of us to retain our faith in the goodness that resides in our social fabric”. The civil society group also appealed to the residents of Gurugram to reject the campaign of hatred initiated by some vigilante groups and instead open their hearts and private and institutional spaces to enable the Muslim community to offer Jumma Namaz.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/amid-sikh-groups-opposition-namaz-not-held-at-gurdwara/article37591253.ece
20 November 2021||GURUGRAM,||Repeal of farm laws may upset political equations in Haryana||The unexpected announcement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday to repeal the three controversial farm laws — largely seen as guided by the political compulsions due to upcoming elections in northern States — seems to have come “a little too late” for the ruling coalition in Haryana to win back the farming community, mostly the Jats. The “damage has already been done”, say political analysts. “Irrespective of whether the farm laws are repealed or not, the Jats, the major agricultural land-owning community in the State, have this feeling of loss of power under the present regime led by a non-Jat Chief Minister after being at the centre of State’s politics for decades, and their opposition to the BJP will continue. The agitation has further fuelled the community’s opposition to the party,” said Rajendra Sharma, Professor, Political Science, Maharishi Dayanand University. “But the Dushyant Chautala-led Jannayak Janata Party, the junior coalition partner, could be the biggest loser of the movement with a large chunk of its support base, mostly the Jats, having drifted back to Indian National Lok Dal,” Prof. Sharma said. Former Haryana Agriculture University professor and political analyst Ram Kanwar said withdrawal of three farm laws was vindication that the agitation against the laws was “justified” and the protesters were “farmers”, thus causing more political damage to the ruling coalition whose leaders had, on several occasions, tried to show the protesters in a poor light and even dismissed the movement as “politically motivated”. Though the political analysts said it was premature to comment on the possible new social combinations emerging in the State out of the agitation, the recent victory of Indian National Lok Dal MLA Abhay Chautala in Ellenabad by-poll being attributed to Dalits and Sikhs joining hands with Jats could be a hint of things to come. Mass movement “The protest against the three farm laws was initially seen as a farmers movement, but the rise in prices of essential commodities and the labour codes turned the poor and the workers also against the present regime making it a mass movement. It is now for the political parties to tap this anger to cobble new social combinations in the State,” said Raju Maan, a Congress leader. Under the leadership of Chaudhary Devi Lal, the Lok Dal had support across “peasantry” communities, including Jats, Sainis, Other Backward Classes and the Scheduled Castes, but over the years the party, now INLD lost its support base among the communities other than Jats with leaders such as Ashok Arora, Hari Singh Saini, P.D. Gupta, Kripa Lal Punia, quitting it. The Congress has traditionally banked on a Jat-SC combination in the State with Chamars, a dominant Scheduled Caste community, supporting the Congress. “If not a State-level social coalition, the parties can try and cobble together social combinations at constituency and district-levels during election,” said Prof. Sharma. However, sounding a note of caution, Inderjit Singh, vice-president of the All-India Kisan Sabha, Haryana, said a clearer picture on the possible political fallout of the agitation would emerge only after the curtains were fully drawn on it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/repeal-of-farm-laws-may-upset-political-equations-in-haryana/article37591264.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao set a two-day deadline to it to respond to the dharna by him demanding procurement of boiled rice produced in ensuing rabi from the State. But, official sources in the Ministry of Food and Public Distribution System have already confirmed, off the record, that only raw rice produced from just concluded kharif alone would be procured henceforth. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) will not be given permission to procure boiled rice produced in rabi because it has these stocks that were sufficient to meet the country’s requirement for four years. The sources circulated a note that said the FCI procured both raw rice of kharif and boiled rice of rabi from the State in excess of the fixed targets in all seasons from 2016-17 to kharif of 2020-21. It was only in rabi of 2021-22 that the procurement of boiled rice was restricted due to a mismatch. Though only 24.75 lakh tonnes was set for procurement, FCI was permitted to lift another 20 lakh tonnes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/centre-yet-to-act-on-kcrs-deadline/article37591258.ece
20 November 2021||JAIPUR:,||Modi govt.’s move a defeat of arrogance, says Rajasthan CM||While Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday said the announcement for the repeal of the three agriculture sector laws was a “defeat of arrogance” of the Narendra Modi government, farmers agitating near Shahjahanpur at the Rajasthan-Haryana border celebrated the decision, danced to drum beats, and burst firecrackers with the claim of having achieved victory. The farmers, who have stayed put at the inter-State border since December 12, 2020, raised slogans such as ‘Modi haara , kisan jeeta ’  (Modi lost, farmers won) and ‘ Kisan ekta zindabad ’ (long live farmers unity). The Samyukt Kisan Morcha will shortly take a decision on lifting the dharna as the Haryana Government has not allowed the protesters to proceed to New Delhi. Kisan Union State president and Alwar Zila Pramukh Balbir Singh Chhillar, who led the agitation, said farmers would deliberate on extending help to the families of those who had lost their lives. “This is a victory of the historic, peaceful and biggest agitation of poor farmers. The Modi government left no stone unturned to defame us,” he said. Talking to reporters at the Pradesh Congress Committee headquarters here, Mr. Gehlot said the BJP government at the Centre had decided to repeal the farm laws “out of panic” in view of the upcoming Assembly election in Uttar Pradesh. “The Centre has failed to understand the farmers’ sentiments,” he said. The Chief Minister pointed out that the Rajasthan Assembly had passed three Amendment Bills in 2020 to stop the applicability of the Central Acts and make them ineffective in certain respects. “On the other hand, BJP leaders at the Centre remained arrogant as ever and refused to budge. This is not the way a democratic government should function,” he said. ‘Crisis of credibility’ Mr. Gehlot said farmers’ groups were still cautious about the implementation of the Prime Minister’s announcement because of the BJP government’s “crisis of credibility”. “That is why we have been repeatedly warning about the direction to which the country is being taken...There is an all-pervading atmosphere of fear, distrust and intolerance, and an unprecedented pressure on institutions,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/modi-govts-move-a-defeat-of-arrogance-says-rajasthan-cm/article37591261.ece
20 November 2021||JAIPUR,||Funds released to reimburse schools for RTE admissions||The Congress government in Rajasthan has lifted the moratorium on reimbursement of fees to private schools for admission of students under the Right to Education Act and approved the release of 25% of the budget withheld earlier. Most of the schools were closed after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The Finance Department had stopped RTE entitlements for about 50,000 private schools on the grounds of their closure because of which the bills could not be cleared. The dues to be paid to private schools amount to a whopping Rs. 300 crore. Free admissions are given to the students aged five to seven years, belonging to the financially underprivileged families under the RTE Act. Private schools had earlier threatened that they would not give admissions this year unless their dues were cleared. Official sources said here on Friday that the verification of online teaching and distribution of textbooks during the pandemic would be carried out on a random basis. Since this will take some time, the Finance Department has approved a proposal to pay 25% of the amount to the schools for 2020-21. This will be adjusted against the last payable amount in the current financial year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/funds-released-to-reimburse-schools-for-rte-admissions/article37591499.ece
20 November 2021||JAIPUr,||3 Rajasthan Cabinet Ministers offer to quit||In an indication of an imminent Cabinet reshuffle in Rajasthan, three Ministers holding important portfolios in the Ashok Gehlot government as well as the party posts on Friday offered their resignation to Congress president Sonia Gandhi. The ministers’ offer to quit suggested that the much-awaited Cabinet rejig will be based on “one man, one post” formula. All India Congress Committee general secretary Ajay Maken, who arrived here on Friday evening to take part in a ‘Kisan Vijay Diwas’ rally, told reporters that Ministers Govind Singh Dotasra, Raghu Sharma and Harish Chaudhary had offered to resign in a letter addressed to Ms. Gandhi and expressed their desire to serve in the party organisation. “I had met the Ministers in Jaipur on July 30, when some of them had expressed their willingness to work for the party. Our three honhaar (promising) Ministers have made the offer of resignation. They obviously want to work in the organisation,” Mr. Maken said at Sanganer airport after his arrival from New Delhi. Mr. Maken, accompanied by Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and Mr. Dotasra, later left for the CM’s official residence. Education Minister Mr. Dotasra is at present the Pradesh Congress Committee president, while Health Minister Mr. Sharma was recently appointed AICC in-charge of Gujarat and Revenue Minister Mr. Chaudhary was made in-charge of Punjab. There are nine vacancies in the Council of Ministers, which will increase to 12 if the resignation of the three Ministers is accepted and they are dropped. The Cabinet reshuffle, possibly accompanied by an expansion, may take place anytime before the Congress government completes three years on December 17. Senior Congress leader Sachin Pilot, who was sacked as Deputy CM and PCC president after his rebellion in July last year, has been demanding a Cabinet reshuffle and political appointments for a long time. Both Mr. Pilot and Mr. Gehlot had separately met Ms. Gandhi in New Delhi last week to discuss the issue. Mr. Gehlot later indicated that the reshuffle would be carried out soon. While a few independent MLAs may be accommodated in the Cabinet, the induction of the legislators loyal to Mr. Pilot is going to be a challenging task for the party high command.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/3-rajasthan-cabinet-ministers-offer-to-quit/article37591262.ece
20 November 2021||Mumbai,||Choksi moves Bombay HC||Businessman Mehul Choksi has moved the Bombay High Court seeking that the proceedings initiated against him by the Enforcement Directorate, which has sought that he be declared a fugitive economic offender (FEO), be kept in abeyance. Mr. Choksi, an accused in the Punjab National Bank fraud case worth Rs. 14,500 crore, moved the High Court on Thursday through senior lawyer Vijay Aggarwal. The ED, in 2019, had moved an application before the PMLA court seeking that Mr. Choksi be declared an FEO under the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, 2018. As per the Act, a person can be declared an FEO if a warrant has been issued against him for an offence involving Rs. 100 crore or more and if the person has left the country and refuses to return. Mr. Choksi, in his application, said that he could not be declared an FEO, since he had not left India to avoid criminal prosecution, but had left well before any FIRs were registered against him. He said that in July 2021, he was granted bail by a court in Dominica and had been permitted to travel to Antigua and Barbuda for medical treatment. However, Mr. Choksi was facing difficulties in travelling because of the ongoing proceedings before the special PMLA court in the city, the petition stated. Mr. Aggarwal told a Single Bench, presided over by Justice S.K. Shinde, that the Dominica court had passed the order permitting him to travel for medical treatment in the presence of Indian authorities. Advocate Hiten Venegaokar, appearing for the ED, opposed Mr. Choksi’s application and sought time to file a detailed reply. The High Court granted the central agency time to filed a reply and posted the matter for further hearing to December 21.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/choksi-moves-bombay-hc/article37591497.ece

20 November 2021||New Delhi,||Victory of farmers, democracy: CM||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday congratulated all the farmers whose tireless struggle over the last year bore fruit when Prime Minister Narendra Modi repealed the three farm laws. The farmers’ struggle, which forced the Centre to bow down and withdraw the laws, was not only a huge victory for them but also for democracy, he said. “Today’s day is a golden day in the history of India. This day will be written with golden letters in the chronicles of Indian history like August 15 and January 26. The Central Government had to finally bow down in front of the farmers’ tireless struggle and withdraw all the kale kanoon [black laws],” Mr. Kejriwal told a digital briefing. “The farmers have proved to all the Governments that in a democracy, the Governments will always have to listen to the people. Only the will of the people will rule. Be it any party or leader, your arrogance will not work in front of the public,” he added. Unifying force Everyone — from labourers, women, arhatis to shopkeepers — took part in the struggle alongside farmers, he said. Be it Punjab or Uttar Pradesh, Bengal or Kerala, the whole country stood with the farmers. So came together all Indians, those living in the country as well as abroad, to create history, he added. “In the history of the world, there would hardly have been a movement bigger or longer than this. Millions of people fought in the harsh sun, rain and cold in a peaceful manner. The whole system did its best to break this movement; they called farmers terrorists, called them Khalistanis, called them anti-nationals,” he said. “Today, like the freedom fighters, the farmers fought and won this fight. One thing pains me that more than 700 of our farmers lost their lives in this movement. This could have been avoided had these laws been rolled back earlier; their lives could have been saved,” he said, adding that their martyrdom will be immortal. Meanwhile, Mr. Kejriwal offered prayers and sought blessings at Gurdwara Sri Rakab Ganj Sahib on the occasion of Guru Nanak Dev’s Parkash Parv. Guru Nanak Dev, he said, did a lot for humanity and it was everyone’s duty to follow the path shown by him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/victory-of-farmers-democracy-cm/article37591247.ece
20 November 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi’s BJP unit in a tizzy after Modi repeals three farm laws||The Delhi BJP’s efforts to explain the three farm laws to the farmers over the last year, including public meetings across 360 villages, came to naught after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced his decision to repeal them on Friday. The party’s State unit has found itself in a tight spot. To put up a brave face following the development, the party had initially planned a thanksgiving programme after Mr. Modi’s televised address. It was, however, called off within minutes. A senior party leader played down the cancelled event as an aberration resulting from ‘miscommunication’. Another leader said it was evidence of the fissures within the party’s State unit, coming as it did due to the lack of an ‘effective communication strategy’. “If you include the ones from the national unit, there are around 56 spokespersons in Delhi. These spokespersons as well as State leaders were put in-charge of the public outreach regarding the laws,” a party source said. “The PM himself took the blame regarding clarifications related to the laws not being communicated effectively. Will these spokespersons and leaders who presided over explanatory events in over 300 Delhi villages own up?” the source asked. Beginning in October last year and carried out until recently, the BJP had organised a slew of events, including ‘khaat baithak’ public meetings and village panchayats as part of a two-pronged strategy to clarify the laws to residents of Delhi’s villages and amplify “issues” with the Delhi Government’s treatment of them. The ostensible strategy, according to the party, was aimed at relaying clarifications regarding the laws to agrarian households in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan. Same strategy A senior party leader said the BJP would continue on the same strategic path of cornering the AAP Government in Delhi on its unkept promises made to the city’s farmers. “The announcement actually gives us an edge against the Delhi Government. We will now corner the Delhi Government on its treatment of the Capital’s farmers by asking why it can’t fulfil its promises to them if the PM can repeal the farm laws in a decision with national ramifications,” a leader said. “The repeal of the laws is expected to have a positive impact on the BJP’s image in western Uttar Pradesh. which is adjacent to Delhi; a BJP wave in the U.P. elections next year will have a positive impact on municipal seats in Delhi as well,” another leader said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/delhis-bjp-unit-in-a-tizzy-after-modi-repeals-three-farm-laws/article37591245.ece
20 November 2021||New Delhi,||A tourney that gives raw talent a chance||When 19-year-old Mohammed Wasim turned up at the ongoing trials for the East Delhi Premier League, which is set to begin on November 30, he was one among many anxious contenders waiting for a chance to show their talent. But he took the selectors by surprise when he bowled at a speed of close to 140 km per hour wearing a pair of slippers. Wasim, an aspiring cricketer from east Delhi, has divided his time between working as a paperboy and practice session. “I lost my parents at an early age, so I did some odd jobs to help my family. My brother works too, but still our financial situation is not good. Getting selected for the tournament would boost my cricketing career. Officials have also helped me out with cricket kits and shoes for my practice,” said Wasim, who is inspired by the likes of Indian pacer Jasprit Bumrah. Conducted by East Delhi MP Gautam Gambhir, the Premier League, which will be held at Yamuna Sports Complex, will have 10 teams named after the 10 constituencies. The winning team will receive Rs. 30 lakh while the runner-up will get Rs. 20 lakh. Residents of east Delhi — in the 17-36 age group — can participate in the ongoing trials, which have former Ranji trophy players as selectors. Among the other raw talents is Shubam, 17, who wants to be an all-rounder. Unable to attend school due to lack of financial resources, Shubham assists his father who runs a laundry shop. “After helping my father for nearly four hours, I spend the remaining time on practice. If I get selected for the league, I will be able to take my career forward in terms of exposure, game time and financial aid. I really hope to emulate players like Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja someday,” he said. Mr. Gambhir, who unveiled the trophy and kits for the league on Thursday, said the objective is to give a chance to those who are not able to showcase their talent due to lack of facilities and resources. “I had promised to bring modern sports infrastructure to East Delhi during my campaign and I am proud that we have been able to deliver. Trials are being held for every player who has registered for the tournament. Your background or what gear you have does not matter, what really matters is your talent. This is the league of the masses,” the MP said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/a-tourney-that-gives-raw-talent-a-chance/article37591252.ece
20 November 2021||New Delhi,||HC issues fresh SOP for hearings||The Delhi High Court has issued a fresh standard operating procedure (SOP) for physical and virtual hearings from next week, which includes tight restrictions on entry into the court blocks, mandatory wearing of mask and social distancing norms related to COVID-19. The new SOP which will be implemented from Monday was issued by Delhi High Court Registrar General Manoj Jain. In an effort to bring down the number of persons visiting the courts, the High Court’s SOP said that entry into the court block for attending physical hearings and videoconference hearings will be restricted to only one advocate accompanied by one junior/intern per party. Entry will also be permitted to the party-in-person, where such party is pursuing the case himself/herself without any legal assistance, and senior counsel engaged by an advocate. “No entry into the court blocks shall be permitted to relatives of any party-in-person or litigant,” the SOP said. Additionally, advocates, parties-in-person and registered clerks above the age of 65 and those suffering from co-morbidities are advised to refrain from appearing in courts. “Persons displaying symptoms of flu, fever, cough etc. shall not be permitted entry into the court complex,” the SOP said. In terms of arrangements inside the courtroom, in order to ensure strict adherence to the social distancing norms, seats in each courtroom will limited to bare minimum. Entry into the courtroom will be permitted to those advocates or parties-in-person whose matter is called out for hearing and also for the advocates whose item is the immediate next, subject to availability of space. The rest of the advocates will wait outside the courtroom in the designated area for their turn, while maintaining the social distancing norms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-issues-fresh-sop-for-hearings/article37591256.ece
20 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Elderly, women protesters refuse to back off||Even as farmers protesting at the Singhu border heaved a sigh of relief after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced to repeal the three farm laws early on Friday, the elderly and women protesters said they were determined to hold fort and not step back despite several obstacles they have faced in the way. They said they will continue to protest with renewed energy. Elderly farmers, who along with several women protesters helmed the protest and were an integral part of it, said they have ignored their age-related ailments throughout the year and survived the Capital’s blistering summers and chilly winters just like any young protester. Ninety-year-old Bawa, who hails from Moga in Punjab, said nothing else has bothered him other than the three farm laws and what mattered was to see them being repealed. “We don’t have any problems either in the summer or winter...we are here for a reason and it is way too important,” the nonagenarian told The Hindu . “Eighty-six and not out”, Nichattar Singh, who comes from Ludhiana in Punjab, proudly introduced himself as he said that he is beyond elated at the announcement. On cloud nine “All of us were going with our business when suddenly one of the farmers came running and told me the news... I was on cloud nine,” Mr. Nichattar said. But he received a call from his family in the morning and they told him to stay put and continue the protest. “I have sworn to not return to my village until the farm laws are repealed...we won’t believe in the PM’s speech, we want it on paper,” he said. Dafedar, 80, from Fatehgarh Sahib in Punjab, said that he has no intention to turn back and return to his village despite the PM’s announcement. “The plan is to not step back...I somehow live here among my farmer brothers and never thought about my age and other ailments; the aim is too important,” he said. Just motivation The octogenarian said that he came to the Singhu protest site exactly one year ago with Rs. 6,500 in his pocket and a pair of clothes. “That’s all I carried with me as I was very motivated to take part in the agitation...even my family back home called me today [Friday] and said that I shouldn’t return and continue to stay here,” he said. Santok Singh, 78, from Punjab, who received around eight stitches after sustaining injuries on his left eye during tear gas shelling last year and has stayed at the Singhu protest site since the first day, said he doesn’t trust politicians as they can go back on their word. Women protesters, some of whom have travelled from their villages leaving their children and kin, said the PM’s decision has validated their agitation, which was also a women-led protest. Paramjeet Kaur, who had come alone from Beas, said she was determined to participate and lead the agitation. “I keep getting calls from my family to return especially after Friday’s decision, but there is a fire inside me that keeps holding me back. Both my sons are farmers and I understand their pain,” Ms. Paramjeet said. She said she does not feel cold during winters and her vigour to lead the protest keeps her warm. “I have come here for a purpose and I’m willing to sacrifice anything for it,” Ms. Paramjeet said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/elderly-women-protesters-refuse-to-back-off/article37591243.ece
20 November 2021||New Delhi,||Taliban takeover impacts presence of Afghan businessmen at trade fair||Hosting traders from various countries, including Nepal, Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey and Sri Lanka, the India International Trade Fair (IITF) is back in Delhi with its 40th edition after a year-long gap induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, for traders from Afghanistan, the crisis back home since the Taliban’s takeover in August has resulted in limited representation at this year’s fair. Dry fruit traders from the country said that a ‘massive dip’ in footfall was observed during the ongoing fair and that nonavailability of direct flights from Delhi to Kabul resulted in delay in procuring stocks. Air routes shut Roman Khan, 21, a dry fruit trader based in Delhi’s Lajpat Nagar, said stocks had to be transported through the Wagah border by road. “Our prices have also increased and the reasons behind this are the financial strain due to COVID-19 and the taxes that we have to pay for getting stocks from Afghanistan using road options. The Taliban’s law is very harsh, especially towards women, and their takeover has impacted business with air routes to India shut. While some people are content with their law, there are many who want to leave Afghanistan,” said Mr. Khan, whose family moved from Kabul to Delhi over a decade ago. Another dry fruit trader from the country, seconding Mr. Khan, said the closure of air routes was ‘the reason why many traders from other industries could not participate’ in this year’s fair. Visa hassle He added, “There are no carpet traders here because either most of them can’t get a visa or they aren’t able to get their stocks. Close to 10 or 12 traders are present at this year’s fair. In our case, we have to wait for over a week to get dry fruit stocks because it is sent via Pakistan and then through the Wagah border. Air cargo was an option that helped cut down this massive delay, which has become a recurring issue. There is no doubt that the Taliban’s takeover has hit our business.” However, according to Siddiqullah Popalzai, 38, owner of a wholesale fresh fruit and dry fruit business, “The Taliban is trying to promote our business”. Mr. Popalzai, who arrived in Delhi a week before the Taliban’s takeover on August 15, said while there was panic during the first week of the takeover, everything returned to normal thereafter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/taliban-takeover-impacts-presence-of-afghan-businessmen-at-trade-fair/article37591249.ece
20 November 2021||New Delhi,||North Delhi corporation blames Govt. for pending salaries of health workers||Two days after the Municipal Corporation Doctors’ Association (MCDA) wrote a letter on pending salaries of health workers under the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, its Standing Committee chairman Jogi Ram Jain on Friday said the reason behind the delayed payments was a financial crisis “caused by the Delhi Government not allocating pending municipal funds”. In the letter — written to higher officials at the Centre, Delhi Government and the North civic body — the MCDA said that while a previously held strike by health workers in March was called off after a written assurance from the North Delhi civic body commissioner promising their salaries, the civic body “has failed to honour the agreement. Hence, we are free to call for [a] strike of doctors”. Dr. Maruti Sinha, general secretary, MCDA, said the non-payment of salaries and previous dues have been a “recurring issue since 2015”. “Every year, we have to protest to get our salaries. Our daily allowance was revised in January and July, but it has not been implemented since January,” said Dr. Sinha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/north-delhi-corporation-blames-govt-for-pending-salaries-of-health-workers/article37591257.ece

20 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Improvement in air quality likely as winds pick up speed||The Capital’s air quality remained in the “very poor” category with an average 24-hour AQI reading of 380 on Friday. The air quality in Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Gurugram, Noida and Greater Noida was also in the “very poor” category. The AQI was 347 on Thursday, down from 375 on Wednesday. The AQI forecast shows that the air quality is likely to improve and reach the lower end of the “very poor” category on November 20 and “poor” category on November 21 due to relatively strong winds. Continuing with its efforts to reduce pollution, the Delhi Government has launched the second phase of the ‘Red Light on Car Off’ campaign. Environment Minister Gopal Rai said that the phase one of the campaign that had run for a month since October has been instrumental in reducing vehicular pollution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/improvement-in-air-quality-likely-as-winds-pick-up-speed/article37591244.ece
20 November 2021||New Delhi,||Tracking waste collection vehicles now a click away||The East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) on Friday launched online tracking of its fleet of waste collection vehicles for residents under the civic body’s jurisdiction. EDMC Commissioner Vikas Anand said that residents can track the vehicles on the civic body’s online portal. He said the move was aimed at providing transparency regarding waste collection and to educate residents on the civic body’s ongoing initiative to ensure segregation of waste by the generator in residential areas. “We have to make more efforts to create awareness among residents and we are talking to RWAs and NGOs for the same. In industrial areas, waste is being segregated and while the results aren’t complete, our efforts are in place especially with door-to-door collection,” said Mr. Anand. Previously, EDMC had directed that commercial establishments will have to strictly ensure waste segregation prior to collection from November 1.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/tracking-waste-collection-vehicles-now-a-click-away/article37591250.ece
20 November 2021||New Delhi,||HC seeks reply to plea for rehabilitation by 60 families||The Delhi High Court has asked the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs and the Delhi Government to respond to a plea by over 60 families, whose shanties were removed from Gol Dak Khana, seeking allotment of flats as part of the rehabilitation scheme. Justice Rekha Palli also issued a notice to the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) and posted the case for further hearing on December 3. The plea said these 60  petitioners and their families were illegally evicted from Gol Market in central Delhi in 2010 and in compliance with an October 2011 order of the authorities, they are staying at a community centre which is a shelter home and awaiting rehabilitation. The plea said the eligibility of petitioners for rehabilitation was established and full payment had been made to the authorities for rehabilitation under a 2015 policy of the Delhi Government as per which the eligible families would get ownership rights over the allotted apartment. The petition has challenged a circular issued by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs in December last year as per which all the vacant and under-construction houses under the erstwhile schemes — Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission and Rajiv Awas Yojana — be available for affordable rental houses for urban migrants and poor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-seeks-reply-to-plea-for-rehabilitation-by-60-families/article37591254.ece

This observation was made at a late night hearing on Thursday by a Division Bench comprising Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Mohit Kumar Shah during a special hearing on an “unprecedented and shocking” matter of physical attack and assault on Additional District and Sessions Judge of sub-divisional court at Jhanjharpur in Madhubani Avinash Kumar-1 by two policemen inside his chamber. The court said, “The present case has been listed before this Bench for special hearing in view of unprecedented and shocking matter in view of a report received from the in-charge District and Sessions Judge Madhubani date 18 November, 2021.” The Bench said, “This episode puts the independence of judiciary in jeopardy.” It fixed November 29 as the next date of hearing. It issued notices to the Chief Secretary, Director General of Police, Principal Home Secretary and Madhubani SP Satya Prakash. It directed the DGP to be present on the next date of hearing. “In view of the sensitivity of the issue, he shall look into the matter and file a status report in a sealed cover,” it stated. Earlier, the District and Sessions Judge had sent a letter to the HC in respect of the “physical attack and assault on Sri Avinash Kumar-1, Additional District and Sessions Judge Jhanjharpur”.

20 November 2021||Patna,||Over 5,000 illegal private nursing homes get notices||Days after the abduction and murder of journalist and Right to Information activist Buddhinath Jha alias Avinash Jha in Benipatti of Madhubani district in Bihar, allegedly for exposing illegal private nursing homes and clinics mushrooming in his area, 5,433 such establishments have been served notices across Bihar for not following stipulated norms, including the Bio-Medical Waste Management Rules, 2016. Of them, 326 are from Patna district alone. Out of 21 such illegal nursing homes and medical clinics against whom the deceased had lodged a complaint, only one was found to be operational in accordance with the established rules, said officials. Buddhinath’s half-burnt body was found by the side of a State Highway in Urain village, 5 km away from his residence in Benipatti, on November 12. He went missing on November 9. His elder brother Chandrashekhar Jha on November 11 lodged an FIR against 11 named and several other unnamed owners of private nursing homes and clinics, alleging the abduction of his brother. “My brother exposed several illegal nursing homes and fake medical clinics in the news portal he was working with and that had led to the closure of several of them,” Mr. Chandrashekhar said. Local police later arrested six people, including a woman, and told mediapersons that the “case was being investigated from both love affair angle and the alleged involvement of owners of private nursing homes and clinics”. “So far, the probe against 21 nursing homes and private medical clinics has been conducted. Out of them, eight were already closed while inquiry reports on some others are awaited. Out of 21, only one nursing home so far has been found to be operational in accordance with stipulated rules and norms,” Madhubani civil surgeon Dr. S.K. Jha said. Closure notices have been served to two nursing homes on Kataiya road in Benipatti. Buddhinath had also filed petitions against these two nursing homes. He was last seen at 10 p.m. on November 9 near one of the two nursing homes after meeting a woman, Purna Kala Devi, who was later arrested. In the State, 5,433 private nursing homes and clinics have been served notices for not following established norms. “Despite several reminders, these private nursing homes and clinics have not been following the Bio-Medical Waste Management Rules, 2016, and have been declared illegal,” said an official of the Bihar State Pollution Control Board.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/over-5000-illegal-private-nursing-homes-get-notices/article37591494.ece

20 November 2021||Washington,||U.S. mulling diplomatic boycott of Beijing Olympics, says Biden||President Joe Biden said on Thursday he was considering a U.S. diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics in Beijing, in what would be an attempt to show toughness over China’s rights abuses without impacting U.S. athletes. That is “something we are considering”, Mr. Biden told reporters while meeting with Canada’s Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, at the White House. The Beijing Olympics take place next February. Mr. Biden’s comments followed a long-awaited video summit with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping late on Monday, during which the two leaders said they wanted to ensure stability and prevent accidental conflicts. The U.S. President is under pressure at home to speak out on China’s human rights abuses, especially in the Xinjiang region where the U.S. government says repression of the Uighur ethnic group qualifies as genocide. Campaigners say that at least one million Uighurs and other Turkic-speaking, mostly Muslim minorities have been incarcerated in camps in Xinjiang, where China is also accused of forcibly sterilising women and imposing forced labour. China’s Foreign Ministry on Friday brushed off the rights accusations as “inconsistent with the truth and completely groundless”, calling Washington’s claims a “joke in the eyes of Chinese people.” ‘Don’t politicise sports’ “Politicising sports is against the Olympic spirit, and harms the interests of athletes from all countries,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a regular press briefing on Friday. On Tuesday, The Washington Post reported that the Biden administration would soon announce a diplomatic boycott, meaning that while athletes would still compete, government representatives would not be in the stands. White House officials said that the issue was not raised during the Biden-Xi virtual summit. U.S.-China relations hit a low point under Mr. Biden’s predecessor Donald Trump, with a massive trade war and incendiary debate over how the COVID-19 virus first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Mr. Biden has sought to re-engage with Beijing, while at the same time focusing on strengthening traditional U.S. alliances to counter China’s ever-growing economic clout and military presence across the Indo-Pacific region.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-mulling-diplomatic-boycott-of-beijing-olympics-says-biden/article37590782.ece
20 November 2021||JAFFNA,||India-funded Jaffna Cultural Centre awaits inauguration||Nearly two years after its construction, the India-funded Jaffna Cultural Centre in Sri Lanka’s Northern Province awaits inauguration, amid persisting uncertainty over who will run the facility. The structure, with 11 floors and facilities, including an auditorium that can seat 600 persons, a conference hall, an amphitheatre and a digital library, was completed in early 2020. Built with an Indian grant of $11 million, the centre was envisaged as a public space to “promote, preserve and foster the cultural heritage of Jaffna”, and serve as “a hub of cultural activities” in Sri Lanka. “We hope to open it soon,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi told a rally in Chennai in February 2021, referring to the Jaffna Cultural Centre. But there has been little movement since, despite India’s subsequent offer to Sri Lanka, to absorb the administrative costs of the centre for five years. As per the Memorandum of Understanding signed by the Governments of India and Sri Lanka in 2014 — during Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa’s second term as President — the Government of India was to hand over the facility to the Government of Sri Lanka that would, in turn, hand it over to the Jaffna Municipal Council, which was given the responsibility of managing its recurring expenses and maintenance. In effect, it was envisioned as a facility in Jaffna, that would be managed by the local municipal authority, and not the Central Government in Colombo. Now, amid questions about the Municipal Council’s ability to spare funds to run the centre, its future looks uncertain. Army’s involvement Local media had also reported on “attempts” to hand over the administration to the Army, which manages the ‘Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre’ in Colombo, sparking concern among locals. “While we have old auditoriums and public spaces in Jaffna, we do not have a modern facility and that is why such a centre, for the use of our people, is welcome,” said S. Raghuram, head of the Department of Media Studies at the University of Jaffna. Observing that the northern people have wanted a stronger Provincial Government to have a greater say in development activities, he said: “The cultural centre ought to be managed by either the Provincial Government, or the local municipal authority for it to function as a people’s asset. There are fears that the Central Government might gobble up this facility too.” Meanwhile, the Mayor of Jaffna said he is “100 % sure” of being able to manage the facility. “I have written to the Indian High Commission, and the offices of the President and Prime Minister, asking for the building to be handed over to us. We have estimated an annual cost of LKR 34 million for that, and I have even made a budgetary allocation from the council’s total budget of LKR 1,466 million for 2022,” Mayor V. Manivannan told The Hindu . He is especially optimistic after India pledged further financial assistance for the centre’s administration. Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla made the announcement in Jaffna last month, during his four-day visit to the island nation. “India supporting the centre for five years gives us time to stabilise, use the facility, and make some revenue from it,” Mr. Manivannan added. Even India’s offer to absorb administrative costs for five years came as a “pre-emptive measure” to deter any Army involvement, well-placed sources told The Hindu, requesting anonymity. For now, the cultural centre, located next to the iconic Jaffna Public Library, stands as the tallest building in Jaffna town, waiting to be used by the people it was intended for. Expressing confidence that the facility would be launched “very soon”, Jeevan Thiyagarajah, the recently appointed Governor of the Northern Province said he would like to see the centre grow to become “a Santiniketan”. All nine provincial councils in Sri Lanka, including the Northern Provincial Council, are currently under their respective Governors’ rule, after their terms expired in 2018 and 2019. “We are keen to see the cultural centre evolve as a hub, where the arts are taught, shared and performed. It might even be possible to beam down the Chennai December music festival in Jaffna in future,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/india-funded-jaffna-cultural-centre-awaits-inauguration/article37590790.ece
20 November 2021||Tokyo,||Japan unveils record stimulus to boost pandemic recovery||Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced a record $490 billion stimulus for the world’s third-largest economy Friday as he looks to shore up the country’s patchy pandemic recovery. The 56 trillion yen injection, the third since the Covid crisis struck last year, “is enough to deliver a sense of safety and hope to the Japanese people”, Mr. Kishida said. The vast spending plans are expected to be approved by the Cabinet later in the day and reportedly include cash and coupon handouts to families with children under 18 who meet an income cap, as well as pay rises for nurses and careworkers. It comes after Japan’s economy shrank far more than expected in the second quarter as leaders struggled to overcome virus surges by imposing containment measures in Tokyo and other cities. Former Prime Ministers Yoshihide Suga and Shinzo Abe poured 40 trillion yen and 38 trillion yen respectively into the economy in 2020, although some analysts have raised doubts over how effective that stimulus has been. “We have been able to build economic measures that will lead to a new society after the pandemic,” Mr. Kishida said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/japan-unveils-record-stimulus-to-boost-pandemic-recovery/article37590779.ece
20 November 2021||London,||U.K. moves to ban Hamas as ‘terrorist organisation’||Showing support for Hamas in Britain could be punished with 14 years in prison if the government succeeds in banning the group as a terrorist organisation, the Home Office said on Friday. Home Secretary Priti Patel will push for the change in Parliament next week, seeking to bring Britain into line with the United States, which designated Hamas a terror group in 1995, and the European Union. Ms. Patel argued an outright ban under the Terrorism Act 2000 was necessary because it was not possible to distinguish between Hamas’ political and military wing. The al-Qassam Brigades military wing of the Islamist movement that rules the Gaza Strip has been banned in Britain since March 2001. “Hamas has significant terrorist capability, including access to extensive and sophisticated weaponry, as well as terrorist facilities,” she tweeted. “That is why today I have acted to proscribe Hamas in its entirety.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/uk-moves-to-ban-hamas-as-terrorist-organisation/article37590783.ece
20 November 2021||Washington,||U.S. authorises COVID-19 booster shots for all adults||The U.S. on Friday authorised Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccine boosters to all people aged 18 and older, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said. Boosters were previously available to the immune compromised, over 65s, people at high risk of severe disease and people in high risk occupations. The decision “helps to provide continued protection against COVID-19, including the serious consequences that can occur, such as hospitalisation and death”, said acting FDA commissioner Janet Woodcock. “This emergency use authorisation comes at a critical time as we enter the winter months and face increasing COVID-19 case counts and hospitalisations across the country,” added Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel. The FDA said it based its decision on strong immune response data from hundreds of people dosed with the two vaccines. Pfizer’s vaccine is dosed at 30 micrograms, the same as the primary series, while Moderna’s is 50 micrograms, half the primary series — but this was not cited by the FDA as data used to make its decision. Pfizer also carried out a clinical trial involving 10,000 people aged over 16 which found the booster restored vaccine efficacy to 95%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-authorises-covid-19-booster-shots-for-all-adults/article37590784.ece

20 November 2021||RIO DE JANEIRO,||Amazon deforestation surges to worst in 15 years||The area deforested in Brazil’s Amazon reached a 15-year high after a 22% jump from the prior year, according to official data published on Thursday. The National Institute for Space Research’s Prodes monitoring system showed the Brazilian Amazon lost 13,235 square kilometres of rainforest in the 12-month reference period from August 2020 to July 2021. That’s the most since 2006. The 15-year high flies in the face of the Bolsonaro Government’s recent attempts to shore up its environmental credibility, having made overtures to the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden and moved forward its commitment to end illegal deforestation at the United Nations climate summit in Glasgow this month. The space agency’s report, released on Thursday, is dated October 27 — before talks in Glasgow began. The Brazilian Amazon hadn’t recorded a single year with more than 10,000 square kilometres of deforestation in more than a decade before Jair Bolsonaro’s term started in January 2019. Between 2009 and 2018, the average was 6,500 square kilometres. Since then, the annual average leapt to 11,405 square kilometres. “It is a shame. It is a crime,” Márcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a network of environmental nonprofit groups, told The Associated Press.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/amazon-deforestation-surges-to-worst-in-15-years/article37590788.ece

20 November 2021||November 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Big haul, small fish and a dead end||An A4 sheet with two lines printed on it made front-page headlines recently. It simply read: ‘Aashi Trading Company, GSTIN: 37AOTPG6030RIZ7’. The paper was pasted with brown duct tape on the wall of a 60-year-old building located in the densely populated locality of Satyanarayanapuram in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh. It could be easily overlooked: it is not particularly eye-catching. But it is important, for this is the address of the Aashi Trading Company which was found to be the intended recipient of the nearly 3,000 kg of heroin seized at Mundra port in Gujarat in September, in one of the biggest drug hauls that India has ever seen. All eyes on Vijayawada It all began on September 15 when, thanks to a tip-off, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) seized the contraband estimated to be worth over Rs. 21,000 crore at Mundra Port in Kutch. The port is run by Adani Ports and SEZ (APSEZ), the ports business under the Gautam Adani-run conglomerate. The consignment was declared as ‘semi-processed talc stones’ from Afghanistan. On opening it, the officials found that it was, in fact, heroin. It had been exported in the garb of talcum powder from Hassan Hussain Limited in Kandahar and shipped from Bandar Abbas Port in Iran to Mundra Port. It was headed to Delhi, according to the police. Since investigations began, 10 people — six Afghan nationals, one Uzbek national and three Indian nationals — have been arrested. But what came as the biggest surprise during the investigation was that this consignment was being imported by a company in Vijayawada run by a Chennai-based couple. The residents of Satyanarayanapuram are dismayed to find their locality in the news for all the wrong reasons. Amid the immediate political blame game that began after this discovery, as well as some media reports connecting the seizure to the city’s who’s who, Vijayawada Police Commissioner B. Srinivasulu sought to cushion Vijayawada from any adverse impact following the disclosure when he stated in a press release that the consignment was not meant for the city. “Heroin worth thousands of crores of rupees seized at Mundra port, Gujarat, was smuggled from Afghanistan. On verification by concerned investigating agencies, it is learnt that one Govindaraju Durga Purna Vaishali, resident of Chennai, has taken GST registration in August 2020 on the address at D. No. 23-14-16, Satyanarayanapuram, Gadiyaramvari Street, Vijayawada,” Srinivasulu said. The Commissioner also said that Vaishali, wife of the Chennai-based Machavaram Sudhakar, had registered the trading company and obtained an Importer-Exporter  Code from the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) with the address last August. The couple has been staying in Chennai for many years. “No activity related to the import, except the use of the address, has come to our notice. The racket has no link to Andhra Pradesh and further probe is on,” Srinivasulu said. The couple is being questioned by the DRI and other anti-drug trafficking agencies. Sudhakar and Vaishali were taken into custody by the DRI team from the Govardhan Giri apartments in Kolapakkam, 20 kilometres off Chennai, a few days after the seizure. After an extended remand, the couple were sent to Palara jail by a special Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) court. The authorities have cordoned off the house where the couple lived as tenants with their two young children. A shocked neighbourhood More than a month later, on October 19, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) obtained custody of the accused, along with one Rajkumar, for 10 days in connection with the heroin import case. Rajkumar is believed to have coordinated the drug transport and other related business deals abroad. According to the police, the NIA is investigating how Aashi Trading Company was used as a front for importing drugs and how the proceeds are being used to support terror activities in the country. The NIA visited the Aashi Trading Company building in Vijayawada on October 9 and conducted an extensive search, according to neighbours living in the area. Vijayawada is a busy railway junction. News of the address being linked to a drug haul has left the residents shaken. Sagar (name changed), a government employee and a cousin of Vaishali, seemed to be in shock. Sagar lives in the same house that the officials barged into, as the property was inherited by both the families. The building spread over about 200 yards is painted sandalwood yellow. It consists of two portions and the company is housed in one of them. The east-facing house on the narrow street is equipped with two air conditioning units and has one single room on the terrace which can be reached through a structured staircase. “Who knew that Aashi Trading was a company trading drugs,” asked Sagar. “As far as I know, Sudhakar was involved in some solar panels-related business. I don’t know anything beyond that. I was in office when the DRI officials came to our place. My wife called me to say that some GST officials had come for some information. When I reached home, I realised that it was the DRI. They wanted to break open the other portion of my cousin’s place to carry out further investigations. They took the permission letter through WhatsApp from Vaishali’s brother who lives in Hyderabad. They searched the place and took some general information from us.” The trail of the drug racket leading to the locality was equally astonishing for neighbours who have been sharing a common wall with this building for 40-50 years. Senior railway employee A. Sridhar, who lives on the southern side of the house, said it is the biggest and strangest news that he has heard in the past four decades. “This colony is known for traditional families and most of them work in the government and in private firms. We hadn’t even noticed the company name on the house till this news was published in the media. In fact, they are very simple people. Sudhakar is a native of Kakinada in East Godavari district. He is a very hard-working man and came up on his own. Vaishali is known to be a very devotional lady. We used to see her performing daily rituals. The couple shifted to Chennai after marriage. We were told that Sudhakar has taken an import and export licence and started some business, but I know nothing about the nature of the business. In my opinion, they are very nice people and someone might have trapped them into this trade,” he said. What did Sudhakar do for a living? The family members in the house seemed unaware of the story behind the company name board on the house and their immediate cousins’ connection to the drug trade. The haul and the lead to an address far away from the port seems to be emblematic of how global drug trade operates: low-profile importers are often used as big names or foreign nationals may raise suspicion. The investigating agencies are now probing every suspicious activity associated with the company, the people behind it, the location of the firm, the online and social media footprint of the couple, among other aspects. The company, investigators found, was first registered in the house address of Taraka, Sudhakar’s mother-in-law. Sources said that the proprietary firm was registered a year ago with the address in Vijayawada, while the couple has been living in Chennai for the past eight years. Though no conclusion can be drawn, a study of the company shows that there is mystery surrounding its intended business activity. While the company is said to have imported 3,000 kg of heroin in the guise of talcum powder, the official and unofficial business activity of Aashi is different according to online and offline records. The online Indian Yellow Pages state that the business activity of Aashi Trading Company involves fruits, vegetables, cereals, foodgrains and rice. But Sagar said that the accused used to import solar panels. “Through conversations we had with him, we learned that the couple used to import and sell solar panels. But we never saw any product coming into this house,” he said. According to Sudhakar’s close relatives, he left his job a couple of years ago and was on his own and living in Chennai. “The last time I saw him was a month ago when the couple came from Chennai to attend a marriage in the family in Vijayawada, in the same house,” Sagar said. Even close relatives do not seem to know much about what Sudhakar did before marriage. “Two years after marriage, he joined a Chennai-based steel sheet-making company. Before marriage, he was with a company in Vizag. Someone told me that he was also with a company in Kolkata,” said a close relative. The statements from relatives indicate that they were clueless about what Sudhakar did for a living. Sudhakar has three Facebook accounts which show that he was working for a public company involved in logistics. In two of these accounts, his location reads Chennai and Kakinada. There were also reports about a couple of businesses that Sudhakar ventured into, but all of them are unconfirmed. Reports, again unconfirmed, also state that the couple has a two-wheeler and a car.  Modus operandi Authorities said that the entities involved are making use of technology and shell firms to remain undetected. Top officials of the Intelligence Bureau (IB) said that the company’s address in Vijayawada was perhaps intended to divert the attention of the authorities from another location for the transport and distribution of the contraband. Official sources said that in most cases, these gangs make sure that the carrier is unaware of the contents of the package while smuggling the banned material. In some cases, gullible people fall into the trap for financial benefit. With the demand for drugs escalating in high-profile circles, the gangs are getting more innovative and organised, they said. The seizure of heroin at the Mundra Port is unquestionably significant, but there have been many instances of seizures of smaller quantities in the recent past. In a landmark seizure in May 2019, the DRI and the Indian Coast Guard together seized over 200 kg of heroin from fishing vessels along the Gujarat coast. In the last few years, the Gujarat Coast has become the preferred route for smuggling of drugs from Pakistan, Afghanistan or Iran. Recently, the Gujarat Anti-Terrorist Squad arrested six persons and seized 144 kg of heroin worth Rs. 700 crore. The drug consignment was apparently sent from Pakistan and delivered mid sea off the Gujarat coast. In April this year, eight Pakistan nationals onboard a boat were apprehended with heroin worth about Rs. 150 crore off the Gujarat coast in the Arabian Sea. A mid-sea operation was commissioned with two high-speed boats and an aircraft of the Indian Coast Guard. Six Pakistani nationals were arrested in the operation. In 2019-20, the DRI seized 72 lots of narcotic drugs and psychotrophic substances covered under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, across the country. Most of the drug consignments appear to originate in Pakistan, officials said. This apart, courier and postal cargo have become the most frequent modes of transportation of drugs by traffickers as these ensure anonymity. In a recent case, officers of the DRI, Chennai, intercepted a consignment of Alprazolam tablets, a psychotropic substance, which was on its way to the U.S. in the guise of herbal and Ayurvedic medicines. About 90 kg of tablets numbering 1,37,665 were located. The DRI’s investigations led it to an international call centre in Jaipur which was run by one of the accused who took orders from customers in the U.S. Given the gravity of the situation, there are regular training sessions for the police and other anti-drug trafficking agencies. The Hyderabad-based Centre for Human Security Studies which (CHSS) said there needs to be coordination and cooperation between several agencies to effectively tackle the menace. Founder and Executive Director of CHSS, K. Ramesh Babu, said India needs to invest heavily in container scanners and strategically deploy them in the 18 major ports and a few important minor ports of India through which the containers come in. “The Israeli and UAE security models are noteworthy here. We need to strengthen the hands of the Central Industrial Security Force and the paramilitary forces of the country with AI-enabled software and tech gadgets,” Ramesh said. The CHSS is planning to organise workshops in collaboration with the Andhra Pradesh Police on drug trafficking and narco-terrorism, body concealment of narcotic drugs and evacuation, etc. shortly.    Political blame game The drug bust and the Vijayawada link has opened the proverbial Pandora’s Box. Political parties have been accusing each other of involvement in the trade. The government, the police and other law-enforcement agencies were quick to state that except for the fact that the office address of Aashi Trading Company is in Vijayawada, the city has nothing to do with the import and transit of the seized heroin. Following allegations by the ruling YSR Congress and the Opposition Telugu Desam Party that the political class was involved in the trade, the Director General of Police Gautam Sawang has sought to clarify multiple times that there was no truth in these allegations. “The accused used a Vijayawada address. There is no drug trafficking in the State,” he said while also appealing to political leaders not to create panic with false information and campaigns. The NIA, which is now investigating the case, said it plans to approach the authorities in Iran to determine the identities of those who helped the syndicate ship the consignment through the Bandar Abbas port. Meanwhile, given the embarassment brought to it by the seizure, the Gujarat-based Adani Group, which operates ports across the country, announced that it will not handle Exim containerised cargo originating from Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan from November 15. “This trade advisory will apply to all terminals operated by APSEZ and including third party terminals at any APSEZ port till further notice,” a trade advisory issued to customers read.

20 November 2021||November 20 2021 00:00 IST,||The defeat of hubris, a confrontation on hold||The repeal of the three farm laws by the Union government, on Friday, marks a historic victory for the farmer’s movement in India. For more than a year, thousands of farmers had barricaded Delhi, and their protests were gradually evolving into a pan-Indian movement of resistance. The belated, though wise, decision by the Government to repeal the laws brings down the curtains on the agitation in Delhi but is unlikely to douse the political fervour it has left behind. The Union government’s response to the protests were appalling and marked by hubris. Its focus was on controlling and positivising the narrative. Efforts were made to break, divide, buy out, demean, denigrate, demonise and shame the protesters, who were conveniently branded as terrorists and Khalistanis. Sedition cases were filed against the protesters. Teargas shells rained on the protest marches, and officials publicly asked the police to smash the heads of protesters. In Lakhimpur Kheri, Uttar Pradesh, a vehicle was driven into a peaceful demonstration, killing several persons. That the protests endured and survived such brutal responses is indeed salutary. The broader context “Reforms” in agriculture, advocated by right-wing economists after 1991, were focused on dismantling the institutional support structures in Indian agriculture that were established after the 1960s. These support structures — in prices, subsidies, credit, marketing, research and extension — were instrumental in India’s achievement of food self-sufficiency between the 1960s and the 1980s. In agricultural marketing, the focus of attack was the mandis governed by the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Acts passed by State Assemblies. It was argued that if India needs to diversify its cropping pattern into export-oriented and high-value crops, mandis need to give way to private markets, futures markets and contract farming. The APMC Acts discriminated against farmers by not allowing them to interact directly with the big corporate buyers and exporters. So, the APMC Acts must be amended so that any private market or rural collection centre can freely emerge anywhere without approval of the local mandi or the payment of a mandi tax, and so that contract farming can be popularised. Similarly, the advocacy for the amendment to the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 rested on the view that private corporate investment can be incentivised into storage and warehousing if stock limits are relaxed for traders. It was a long-held constitutional consensus in India that agricultural marketing was the legislative arena of State governments. Thus, in 2003, the Union government prepared a Model Act on agricultural marketing and sent it to States for passage in State Assemblies. This was followed by the preparation and circulation of two other Model Acts, in 2017 and 2018. Reception to these Model Acts was neither dismissive nor welcoming. Many States selected a few clauses, which they found attractive and suitable to their contexts, and accordingly amended their APMC Acts between 2003 and 2020. Only one State — Bihar — used the occasion to completely annul its APMC Act in 2006. Laws were unconstitutional The consensus was broken in 2020, when the Union government took up on itself the task of legislating on agricultural marketing and passed the farm laws. Federal principles were violated as the Union government invoked Entry 33 of the Concurrent List to intervene into matters in Entry 14, Entry 26 and Entry 27 of the State List. The farm laws even interfered with Entry 28 of the State List, which were not subject to Entry 33 of the Concurrent List. Thus, to begin with, the farm laws were reasonably and justifiably argued to be unconstitutional. However, the Supreme Court of India refused to act swiftly on petitions filed before it. Instead, without consulting the protesting farmer’s organisations, it appointed, in January 2021, a committee of four persons, all of whom had publicly declared their support for the farm laws. Farmer’s organisations, on their part, distanced themselves from the committee and continued with their agitation. Apart from constitutionality, the contents of farm laws were also widely criticised. Bihar’s example showed that private investment was unlikely to flow into agricultural markets even if APMC Acts were annulled. In fact, the exploitation of farmers by unscrupulous traders intensified in Bihar after 2006. Kerala never had an APMC Act. Yet, there was little presence of private investment in its agricultural markets. Maharashtra delisted fruits and vegetables from the ambit of APMCs in 2016. Still, the inflow of private investment into agricultural markets was only marginal. Thus, what was likely was that a formal and regulated market might fragment itself into an informal and unregulated market if the APMC Acts were weakened. Furthermore, two other problems were highlighted. One, mandi taxes were used to invest in rural infrastructure in States such as Punjab. If mandis are weakened, what would substitute for such investments? Two, even if private markets emerged, how would they address the structural problem of poor farm-gate aggregation of the produce of small and marginal farmers? Would one middleman be simply substituted by another? Proponents of farm laws had no convincing answers. The grievance redress mechanisms for contract farming also came up for criticism. The obliteration of the power of civil courts and their substitution with a weak mechanism led by the sub-divisional magistrate threatened to be a serious impediment to a just redress of complaints. It was feared that this may benefit corporate sponsors more than the contracting farmers. It pointed towards corporates Finally, the overall thrust of the farm laws appeared to encourage the participation of larger corporate players in agricultural markets rather than farmer-friendly organisations, such as cooperatives or Farmer Producer Companies (FPC). Especially in the case of the amendment of the Essential Commodities Act, there was reasonable suspicion that a handful of corporate players were to substantially benefit from investments in logistics, storage and warehousing. The farmers’ protests began from States such as Punjab and Haryana where the mandis were deeply rooted institutions in the local economy and society. However, as days passed, the agitation spread to western Uttar Pradesh and from there to many other States. In a few months, the agitation threatened to grow into a pan-Indian phenomenon with a constant addition of local agrarian demands into the larger demand for the repeal of farm laws. Such local customisation of the agitation immensely helped in the cause of mobilisation. An unusually large number of women actively participated in the protests. In regions such as western U.P., the protests also threatened to bridge and repair the communal fault lines that were consciously cultivated after the Muzaffarnagar riots of 2013. Numerous protesters perished on the protest grounds, but support for the protests grew not just domestically, but also globally. A mindset of intolerance It was not just hubris that marked the Government’s response, but also infantilism. When pop star and celebrity Rihanna tweeted a rather innocent comment about the protests, the entire machinery of the ministry of external affairs was awoken for an extraordinarily disproportionate response. Indian embassies were asked to spread the word that she and other celebrities were propagandists who had irresponsibly ganged up to discredit progress in India. These responses showed nothing but a deeply disturbing official mindset of intolerance and insecurity. The repeal of the farm laws has, at least temporarily, put an end to an ugly and eminently avoidable chapter of confrontation between the Union government and the farmers. However, the momentum that the agitation has left behind would surely linger on. The agitation has led to a positive politicisation of several agrarian demands, including the need for stable markets and remunerative prices. A confidence has grown that committed struggles matter and even aggressive governments can be made to kneel. New rural mobilisations around demands to address the larger and persistent agrarian crisis are likely to emerge and grow. We surely are in for interesting times. R.

20 November 2021||November 20 2021 00:00 IST,||The story of an arrest, a ‘resolution’ and retribution||The arrest, on October 31, 2021, of the former Chairman, State Bank of India (SBI), Pratip Chaudhuri — in a case that was related to a hotel project in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan that was financed by the bank — became the centre of attention, but reactions were mixed. There are some who consider the arrest of any banker as well-deserved without bothering to ask the reason. Such callous reactions are often spawned by ‘Wiki-pandits’. One such person wrote: “… was arrested... for selling property as (sic) throwaway price to one company and he joined same company after retirement.” The background The group which ran the luxury hotel, GarhRajwada, in Jaisalmer, availed a loan of Rs. 24 crore and cash credit of Rs. 1 crore from the SBI in 2007. With repayments not forthcoming and the global financial crisis raging, the bank restructured the account in 2009. It became a non-performing asset in June 2010. The bank recalled the loan. On non-payment, it approached the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) in 2013 for Rs. 39.69 crore. It also proceeded under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act. To secure its financial interest, the bank assigned the loan to the Alchemist Asset Reconstruction Company (AARC) for Rs. 25 crore. AARC pursued the matter in the DRT and under the SARFAESI Act. It also approached the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). It had to move the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) and the Supreme Court of India before the NCLT admitted the matter in March 2017. The dilatory tactics of the promoters, including not handing over company vehicles to the Interim Resolution Professional (IRP), delayed the process. These invited strictures from the NCLAT and the Court. The promoters also filed a first information report against the IRP resulting in his arrest. The Court quashed these proceedings. In December 2017, despite the attempts by the promoters to delay things on frivolous grounds, the NCLT permitted the sale of the hotel to JFC Finance. The lenders were paid in full while the promoters received just Rs. 1 per share, or Rs. 17.4 lakh. The case was the first such sale after the IBC barred promoters from bidding for their own assets. Recovery yield The bank recovered Rs. 25 crore out of dues of Rs. 40 crore. Recovering over 60% is excellent when globally, such sales yield only around 30% or less. In India, recoveries average only 23.2% across various channels. It is highest through the IBC at 45.5% of the amount involved. Recoveries through the SARFAESI route come to 26.7%. Lok Adalats and DRTs come next with 6.2% and 4.1%, respectively. As the sale of the underlying security was done by the ARC, the consideration received by the bank when assigning its dues and its appropriateness as compared to the security value is irrelevant. This sale is unrelated to the value of the underlying security. Thus, a transparent process was followed for the sale of the receivables by the bank to the arc, and by the arc to the final buyer. So there was no case for malfeasance against any banker including Mr. Chaudhuri. He laid down office as Chairman of the SBI in September 2013, about six months before the bank sold the asset to ARC in March 2014. He joined the board of ARC six months later in October 2014. In any case, such individual cases do not come to the chairman of a bank of the SBI’s standing The  logic behind accepting smaller amounts in settlement is based on a banker’s judgment that recovering Rs. 25 crore today is better than recovering an uncertain amount in the distant future, given the time value of money and delays in our judicial processes. The second reason is that banks are in the business of banking, and recovery is not their forte. Investing people and money in messy recovery processes — through specialised branches or otherwise — distracts a bank from its core business. Mr. Chaudhuri’s arrest took place in a related case where the same borrower alleged fraud in an apparent act of retribution. The case was initially dismissed for want of criminality. The matter was later revived and a non-bailable warrant issued. The arrest of Mr. Chaudhuri and not that of the other directors indicate that he was either not briefed or defended properly; or he was the victim of overconfidence. A destabilisation The episode betrays a lack of understanding of the recovery process and its underlying principles. These could have been clarified during discussions. That there were none indicates an attempt to put the system under duress through blackmail to get the desired result. The balance of power between the lender and borrower has moved like a pendulum. At periodic intervals, the Government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have moved to strengthen the hands of the lender vis-à-vis the borrower, and vice-versa. But, an unstable equilibrium was often restored with the system, bankers and other gatekeepers included, conspiring to put the system back in favour of the borrower. In 1962, after the Palai Central Bank failed, an amended RBI Act provided for a de facto credit information bureau, which would have been among the first in the world. What would have strengthened information sharing among bankers soon became dysfunctional. A decade later, in 1971, a study group recommended setting up a Credit Information Trust. The entire system was discontinued in 1995. The Credit Authorisation Scheme, inventory norms, and other regulations were started from the late 1960s onwards with similar pious intentions. But, an industry of professionals sprung up to train and advise borrowers on how to cook up figures to get the level of credit they wanted. The Debt Recovery Tribunal was introduced in 1993 following the Narasimham Committee recommendations of 1991. About a decade later, the SARFAESI Act was passed. These were intended to speed up recovery and strengthen the hands of bankers. But, the system, over the years, became compromised in different ways. This included the non-appointment of judges, failed auctions, delayed payments, and so on. The IBP is the most effective system to date to secure the interests of the lender. Mr. Chaudhuri’s arrest is an early symptom of attempts to hijack the system. An alert Government and regulator should move fast to close the gaps. Those who wield high-level fiduciary responsibilities should also be circumspect deciding who they associate with later. Very often they are not after the persons or their worth, but their last designation. G.

20 November 2021||November 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Seeds of hope||Prime Minister Narendra Modi has done the right thing by announcing the repeal of the three farm laws that are at the centre of a protracted confrontation between his government and a section of farmers for a year. The laws sought to reorganise India’s agriculture sector more in accordance with the principles of market economy. They would have redesigned the country’s food procurement and distribution mechanisms, triggering fears that the producers and consumers would be adversely affected, to the benefit of big companies. Such fears were aggravated by the undemocratic manner in which these laws were brought about, through ordinances, and passed in Parliament without deliberations, or consultations with the States. The decision to repeal them is a triumph of democracy. On the one hand, the tenacity of the agitating farmers that the BJP and state agencies could not break while on the other, the looming Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, forced the ruling party’s hand. In bowing to public demand, Mr. Modi has shown flexibility and pragmatism. Farmers should not only withdraw the protest now but also show a more flexible approach regarding the path ahead to reform the sector. Flexibility is not a bad trait in democracy, which is about constant negotiations, but it should not be merely political expediency. In this instance, the agitators were socially dominant, and economically and politically powerful groups whose hostility the BJP found difficult to handle. This should be an occasion for the Government to revisit its general attitude towards protest mobilisation. The reflex of the current dispensation has been to paint opponents and critics as traitors or anti-nationals — a tactic that was tried even in the case of the farmers. A consultative decision making would always be more sustainable and easier to enforce. Further moves on agriculture sector reforms must draw from the experience of the making, and now the repeal, of the three farm laws. Their repeal does not invalidate the urgent case for reforms in the agriculture sector, in which incentive mechanisms are skewed, and environmental costs are unsustainable. Those will have to be pursued in a manner suitable to a federal democratic polity as India’s. The repeal of these laws will likely spur a realignment of politics in U.P. and Punjab, where Assembly elections are round the corner. The RLD, which is influential among the Jat farmers in western U.P., might now see the BJP in a different light. The Congress has been supporting the protesting farmers, and can claim victory. But by repealing the laws the BJP has increased its political space in both States, more so in Punjab where the Congress is in power. The BJP’s estranged ally, the Akali Dal, and Amarinder Singh, former Congress CM who was humiliated by the party, will also look for new opportunities in the situation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/seeds-of-hope/article37590766.ece
20 November 2021||November 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Error corrected||The Supreme Court has done well to correct an egregious error of interpretation committed by a judge in the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court in holding that sexual assault on a child victim would require “skin-to-skin” contact. It has set aside two judgments that acquitted two offenders against children from the graver charge of sexual assault, even while sentencing them to short prison terms for lesser offences. The High Court had construed Section 7 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, pertaining to sexual assault on children, in such a way that it concluded that the acts for which the accused were charged did not amount to sexual assault. The Attorney General of India took the initiative to challenge these two verdicts. The NCW also questioned the Court’s understanding of a POCSO provision, arguing that the law does not brook the sort of dilution that led to the Court ignoring the basic fact that the entire Act is aimed at penalising actions rooted in sexual intent. The Supreme Court showed alacrity and sensitivity in staying the portions of the judgment related to the diluted interpretation earlier this year. In one case, the act of groping a 12-year-old girl’s breast over her dress and, in another, the acts preparatory to an assault on a five-year-old were proved in the trial. Even after accepting these facts, the absence of physical contact with the girl’s body part was used to absolve the accused of the charge of sexual assault. In the second case, the Court took a lenient view that the act of “holding the hands of the prosecutrix” and “opening the zip of the pant” did not fit into the definition of sexual assault. It was quite apparent that the High Court’s understanding was flawed and out of sync with the legislative intent behind the enactment of a stringent law to protect children based on principles found in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Writing for the Bench, Justice Bela M. Trivedi has said that restricting the interpretation of the words ‘touch’ or ‘physical contact’ to ‘skin to skin contact’ would be a narrow and pedantic interpretation of Section 7, and if such a narrow interpretation is accepted it would frustrate the very object of the Act. The judgment sets right not only a misinterpretation of the statute but also underscores that the core ingredient of a sexual offence is the “sexual intent” behind it. While restoring the trial court’s conviction for ‘sexual assault’ in one case, and ‘aggravated sexual assault’ in the other, the apex court has rejected attempts to interpret a law in favour of the accused when there was no real ambiguity in it. And in any case, as Justice S. Ravindra Bhat has pointed out in his concurring opinion, an interpretation should not be destructive of the law’s intention.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/error-corrected/article37590767.ece
20 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Devas to continue fight for AI’s assets||Shareholders in Devas have written to a U.S. District Court asserting that Air India’s sale to the Tatas did not impact its petition seeking seizure of the airline’s assets to recover the arbitration award it won against the Indian government. They have also claimed that the Tatas could be liable for damages. Dated November 15, the letter follows AI’s supplemental letter where the airline has underlined that its forthcoming privatisation weakens the merit of the enforcement action sought by Devas. Air India (AI) has also demanded a stay on discovery pending its forthcoming motion seeking dismissal of Devas’s petition. “Air India is incorrect. India’s sale of Air India will not moot this case... will not impair — much less destroy — the Court’s ability to grant Plaintiffs effective relief,” law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher contended in the letter. In June 2021, Devas Shareholders had filed a petition in a New York court seeking to seize AI assets in the U.S. as reparation for India’s failure to pay the satellite firm. The letter said Devas’s shareholders hold an arbitral award of more than $111 million against India under the India-Mauritius Bilateral Investment Treaty. The shareholders have won sums totalling in excess of $1 billion across multiple awards against India. In 2011, state-owned Antrix Corp. had cancelled contracts with Devas, resulting, the latter said, in erosion of investment value. The June petition said the airline was an “alter ego of the Republic of India” and was jointly liable for the debts and obligations of India. AI has argued that its sale to the Tatas will eliminate any possibility that the airline could remain an alter ego of India. Devas’s lawyers claimed that “the relevant time period for determining whether Air India is India’s alter ego is before this action (the June petition) was filed.” A message sent to Secretary, Department of Investment and Public Asset Management, elicited no response. “If Air India is found to be India’s alter ego at the time of the arbitral award, Air India’s transfer must be subject to Plaintiffs’ claims. Tata will take control of Air India with notice of Plaintiffs’ claim on a portion of its assets,” they said in the letter. Devas’s lawyers reiterated their demand for discovery of AI’s assets urgently, as the transfer of control to the Tatas will “endanger” their ability to get discovery as the new owners may lack knowledge of document location and inventory, they said. The Centre aims to hand over AI to the Tatas by this year-end. British firm Cairn Energy, having won an arbitral award in the retro tax case against India, had recently agreed to give up claims to AI’s assets after the government repealed the law concerned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/devas-to-continue-fight-for-ais-assets/article37591112.ece
20 November 2021||COIMBATORE,||Higher GST rates disappoint textiles, clothing industry||The Centre’s notification on higher GST rates for several textile and apparel items from January next has come as a blow to micro, small and medium-scale textile and clothing units with industry groups asserting the move will push up prices for consumers and spur inflation. In an industry where almost 80% of the units are in the MSME segment, fixing 12% for fabrics and garments will only lead to higher prices for the common man, said Sanjay K. Jain, chairman of the Committee on Textiles, Indian Chamber of Commerce. “The industry and the market can absorb 3% to 4% hike,” he remarked. “But 7% is too steep and sudden. It is the MSME units that make the low-cost garments mostly and these units may suffer from drop in demand.” Industry groups were disappointed that their representations to the government to maintain status quo or bring the entire textile supply chain under 5% rate had not been heeded, Mr. Jain added. Clothing Manufacturers Association of India Chief Mentor Rahul Mehta said the notification was both ‘disappointing and distressing.’ The move would lead to higher prices for the end consumer at a time when high raw material costs had already impacted prices. Industry sources observed that almost 90% of fabric production in the country was in the unorganised sector. Increasing the rate to 12% for fabrics would hit the power loom and handloom weavers. The textile sector was certain to require additional working capital now.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/higher-gst-rates-disappoint-textiles-clothing-industry/article37591110.ece
20 November 2021||New Delhi,||Global tech talent crunch may last for a decade: IBM chairman||Chairman and CEO of 110-year-old global tech major International Business Machines (IBM), Arvind Krishna, on Friday said the tech talent crunch was not just an Indian phenomenon but a global one; and was likely to stay that way for the next decade, at least. Mr. Krishna, who is on a visit to India, was addressing the media. “Today every company, every country, every government has woken up to that fact that technology is not a cost of doing business but... is a fundamental competitive advantage. That is why there isn’t enough (tech talent) supply,” Mr. Krishna said. He added that this was especially true in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, blockchain technology and cybersecurity, where supply was significantly behind demand and would continue to be so for the next few years. Under his leadership, IBM has optimised its portfolio, focusing more on high-margin, consulting and software work which constitutes about 70% of its business. It has spun off non-core, relatively lower-margin business, like managed infrastructure services which is now a new company, Kyndryl. “We have increased our spending on organic R &D. We have also increased our M&A spend. We have acquired 17 companies since last April, across security, multi-cloud and several other areas. Almost half of IBM today is in software. This is a dramatically different business make-up than it has been over the past decades. That will allow us to participate where there is growth in the market,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/global-tech-talent-crunch-may-last-for-a-decade-ibm-chairman/article37591115.ece

20 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||TN and Karnataka on collision course||Defending champion Tamil Nadu and Karnataka have given all indications of being potential finalists all through this edition of the Syed Mushtaq Ali (T20) tournament. A victory away from that title clash, these contenders run into starless, but unbeaten rivals in the semifinals on Saturday. TN takes on Hyderabad in the morning at the Ferozeshah Kotla ground before Karnataka plays Vidarbha. Preferring the chase With the onset of winter, teams have preferred to chase, after the new-ball bowlers had made the most of the nippy conditions and moisture on the pitch in morning matches. The choice should be no different on Saturday. TN clearly holds the edge not only due to its overall strength but also because it returns to the same venue within 48 hours of chasing down Kerala’s 181 with ease. Hyderabad, which began its campaign at full strength, is now without Hanuma Vihari and Siraj Mohammad. But the manner in which it outplayed two-time winner Gujarat on Thursday shows the team is no less fired up to go one better than the 2009-10 runner-up finish. Unlike TN, whose batters have come good and appear increasingly consistent, Hyderabad has largely depended on skipper and opener Tanmay Agarwal, the top run-getter this season. In addition, left-arm medium-pacer C.V. Milind, with 18 wickets, is the highest wicket-taker this season. Easy passage One team that has faced least resistance on its way to the semifinals is Vidarbha. After topping the Plate group, Vidarbha stretched its impressive run by whipping Maharashtra by seven wickets and Rajasthan by nine wickets. Though not much should be read into Vidarbha’s league performances, batters Atharva Taide and skipper Akshay Wadkar continue to look good. Among the bowlers, lanky spinner Akshay Karnewar (13 wickets) and pacer Yash Thakur (10) are the ones to watch. Wake-up call But Vidarbha’s run could end against Karnataka, which has survived a few anxious moments in its campaign. Its escape to victory against Bengal should serve as a wake-up call. Under Manish Pandey, this depleted team still has the potential to regain the title won twice in the last three seasons. With Karun Nair and Abhinav Manohar looking in great touch and leg-spinner K.C. Cariappa consistently pitching it right, the team can hope to justify the the favourite tag.

20 November 2021||Ranchi,||Rahul, Rohit drive India to series win||A clinical 117-run opening partnership between K.L. Rahul (65, 49b, 6x4, 2x6) and Rohit Sharma (55, 36b, 1x4, 5x6) helped India record a seven-wicket victory over New Zealand in the second T20I here on Friday. The full house at the JSCA International Stadium Complex cheered the home team to an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series. India made short work of the 154-run target, completing the task with 16 deliveries to spare. In total control Rahul and Rohit stayed in control from the start of the chase. Rohit accelerated in the 10th over, bowled by left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner, carting two big sixes. Rohit received a life in the same over, on 29, when Trent Boult put down a regulation chance at long-on. Rahul then got into the act, smacking Adam Milne for a six and a four. The duo’s exploits brought the required run rate to below seven. By the time Rahul and Rohit departed, India had effectively sealed the win. Losing the plot Earlier, New Zealand frittered away a great start to finish with a sub-par score. Openers Martin Guptill (31, 15b, 3x4, 2x6) and Daryl Mitchell (31, 28b, 3x4) attacked pacers Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Deepak Chahar to propel the side to 64 for one in six overs. From here, the visitor added just 89 runs in 14 overs. R. Ashwin, Axar Patel and debutant Harshal Patel tightened the screws, turning the momentum India’s way. The middle-order — Mark Chapman (21, 17b, 3x4), Glenn Phillips (34, 21b, 1x3, 3x6) and Tim Seifert (13, 15b, 1x4) — erred by taking an overly cautious approach. Jimmy Neesham (3, 12b), expected to finish the innings with a bang, was terribly out of sorts. Ashwin, just like he did in the first T20I, spun a web around the batters. Axar was typically stingy with freebies. Harshal was the most impressive of the lot, showing no signs of nerves. The slower deliveries, which had brought him so much success in the IPL, were on full display here. Time and again, batters committed early and got tangled up in awkward hitting positions. Mitchell, who lobbed a cutter to long-on, was Harshal’s maiden international wicket. Another cutter got rid of Phillips, who had only just begun to take on the quicks. Guptill, meanwhile, overtook Virat Kohli to become the highest run-scorer in T20I cricket. He struck a couple of astonishing sixes off the speedsters, clearing his front leg and hitting golf-like tee shots to send the ball straight and far. Dropped catches by Rahul and Venkatesh Iyer, which handed lives to Guptill and Phillips respectively, did not prove to be costly for India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rahul-rohit-drive-india-to-series-win/article37591062.ece
20 November 2021||CHENNAI,||Joshna bullish on India’s chances||Joshna Chinappa loves playing with children. After working out at the Indian Squash and Triathlon Academy (ISTA) here on Friday, the 35-year-old World No. 12, was seen hitting the squash ball on one of the outsides courts with a little girl for a while. Joshna said she’s looking forward to competing in the Asian team (men & women) championships to be held in Kuala Lumpur from November 30 to December 4. Seeded third, Joshna felt that Malaysia is a good place to host the event and that the third-seeded Indian women’s team has a good chance to return with a medal. “It’s good that the event is happening in Malaysia, which has strict COVID-19 rules. They have found a way to have a bubble with three simultaneous events in KL: a PSA event (Nov. 23 to 27), the Asian teams, and men’s team Worlds (Dec. 7 to 12). We have a good chance to equal our seedings and am looking forward to representing India after a long time,” said the reigning Asian individual champion. Heavy burden Without the services of Tanvi Kanna, who is nursing an ACL injury, and Dipika Pallikal, who has been recently blessed with twins, the Indian women’s team will be heavily burdened, but Joshna disagreed. “This team has not played as much for India as teams in the past. Having said that, it is anyone’s game. I have to win my matches and if the rest of the team can back me by winning theirs, anything is possible. With our attitude and outlook, we will play our best and just take it one match at a time,” said Joshna. Despite being the lone senior member of the team, Joshna said there will be no pressure and that she enjoys playing team events. “I’ve been playing for India since I was 12 years old. Pressure comes when I am playing on the professional tour. In a team game, I love the team support. I am relaxed and, in fact, play better,” she said. Top seeding The Indian men’s team, on the other hand, will be looking to win the gold having been given top seeding. “I think we have a good chance to win. We will all have to play well to execute our plans to good effect,” said Saurav Ghosal, world-ranked 15. “Tough competition is expected from Malaysia, Hong Kong and Pakistan, too.” The Indian men’s and women’s teams did not take part in the last edition, the 2018 Asian team championships, as it coincided with the preparations for the Commonwealth Games. Joshna and Ghosal, however, will not defend their singles crown in the Asian individual championships scheduled in Islamabad, Pakistan from December 15 to 19.  The teams:   Men: Saurav Ghosal, Mahesh Mangaonkar, Ramit Tandon, S. Velavan; Women: Joshna Chinappa, Sunayna Kuruvilla, Urwashi Joshi, Aparajitha Balamurukan. Coaches: Harinder Pal Singh & Surbhi Misra .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/joshna-bullish-on-indias-chances/article37591161.ece
20 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Vishnu subdues Nitin in a battle of wits||Olympian Vishnu Vardhan captured some of the old magic to subdue Nitin Kumar Sinha 7-6(3), 2-6, 7-5 in a battle of wits that lasted three hours and 31 minutes in the quarterfinals of the $15,000 ITF men’s tennis tournament here on Friday. The 22-year-old Nitin saved match points on his serve in the ninth game of the decider, before the 34-year-old Vishnu stepped up his game to sneak through in the climax. After missing the match points while going for his big shots, Vishnu converted the first match point on his serve in the 12th game with a deft slice. It was the rich experience of having won 10 singles titles and 40 doubles titles in the international professional circuit as much as his commendable physical fitness and sharp game that helped Vishnu prevail this day. In the semifinals, Vishnu will take on Valentin Vacherot who proved too good for Abhinav Sanjeev Shanmugam. Second seed Sidharth Rawat played a compact game to oust the reigning national champion Niki Poonacha who had won the last ITF event at the same venue in April. In the semifinals, Sidharth will play Philip Sekulic of Australia who stopped Dev Javia in straight sets.  The results: Singles (quarterfinals): Vishnu Vardhan bt Nitin Kumar Sinha 7-6(3), 2-6, 7-5; Valentin Vacherot (Fra) bt Abhinav Sanjeev Shanmugam 6-1, 6-3; Philip Sekulic (Aus) bt Dev Javia 7-5, 6-2; Sidharth Rawat bt Niki Poonacha 6-1, 6-2.   Doubles (semifinals): Saketh Myneni & Vishnu Vardhan bt Paras Dahiya & Parikshit Somani 6-3, 6-7(7), [11-9]; Julian Cash (GBr) & Zsombor Velcz (Hun) bt Anirudh Chandrasekar & Niki Poonacha 7-5, 6-3 .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/vishnu-subdues-nitin-in-a-battle-of-wits/article37591589.ece
20 November 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Kerala University’s famous triumph remembered||Forty years ago, Kerala University achieved a remarkable feat. It became the all-India inter-university football champion for the first time and embossed its name on the Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee Trophy. In the final held at the Kuruskhetra University, Kerala, led by John Mathew, beat Calicut 5-4 in the tie-breaker after both teams drew 1-1 at the end of extra time. The triumph ended a long wait for a football title by the varsity and it was made possible by astute coaching of Ibrahim Kutty who took charge that year. It was a nostalgic trip to many members of the 1981 cup winning team and others who played for the university till 1985 when they gathered together in Thiruvananthapuram to pay ‘Guruvandanam’ to Ibrahim Kutty and Pathrose Mathai, the then Director of physical Education. The hall at Mascot hotel was awash with memories of the trailblazing win.  “When I took charge, Kerala University was undivided and we had affiliated colleges till Angamaly in Ernakulam district. We had a large pool of players and we chose around 90 for the camp. The camp was held in three phases in Thiruvananthapuram. At the camp we concentrated mostly on improving the fitness of the players. We worked on the tactics and techniques in the final phase. For me the practice matches against department teams KSEB, KSRTC and Travancore Titanium were important and helped me identify players for the final squad. They performed well in those practice matches and their confidence were high,” reminisced Kutty “However, we were not expected to win against Calicut in the final. They were the favourites and had a good team. We played a tactical game and held them to a 1-1 draw in extra time. In the penalty shoot-out I was confident that my boys would not miss any kicks. During training I had made each one of them take at least 50 kicks and it put them in good stead,’’ said Kutty, who retired as Physical Education director, MG University. The university went on to become runners-up twice (1983 and 85) in the all-India championships under Kutty. “Those five years when Ibrahim Kutty sir was in charge could be described as the golden age of Kerala University. He was meticulous and believed in hard work. Many of us blossomed under him,” said Gee Varghese, a former Indian university player, who was part of the team that finished runner-up in 1985. An exhibition match between players was kicked off by Kutty to mark the occasion of that famous triumph.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kerala-universitys-famous-triumph-remembered/article37591507.ece
20 November 2021||London,||Liverpool to test Arsenal revival||Liverpool will pose a stern test of Arsenal’s revival when the Premier League title chaser hosts Mikel Arteta’s resurgent side on Saturday. The international break offered a welcome respite for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, but Manchester United’s beleaguered manager is in the firing line again as his troubled team heads to Watford. Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard is back in the Premier League and takes charge of his first match as Aston Villa boss against Brighton. Since a dismal 5-0 thrashing at Manchester City in August, Arsenal has surprisingly emerged as the Premier League’s form team. Critics silenced That chastening defeat sparked calls for Gunners boss Mikel Arteta to be sacked, but the critics have been silenced by an eight-game unbeaten run in the league. Not even leader Chelsea took as many points over that period as Arsenal, which has won six and drawn two to climb to fifth in the table. Fuelled by the emergence of young England midfielder Emile Smith Rowe and Arteta’s successful overhaul of his previously leaky defence, Arsenal is dreaming of a return to the Champions League via a top four finish. Arsenal skipper Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been back among the goals and his bubbly mood reflects the team’s current confidence.  Surprise defeat After a relatively benign run of fixtures, Liverpool is the first serious threat to Arsenal’s renaissance, with the Reds desperate to bounce back from their surprise 3-2 defeat at West Ham before the international hiatus. Sitting four points behind Chelsea — and two ahead of Arsenal — fourth placed Liverpool can ill afford another setback after two league games without a win. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is locked in a desperate fight to save his job as Manchester United try to get its chaotic campaign back on track at Watford. Solskjaer was expected to oversee a sustained challenge for United’s first English title since 2013 after the signings of Cristiano Ronaldo, Jadon Sancho and Raphael Varane.  But the United boss has struggled to turn his star-studded squad into a coherent team, leading to a series of damaging defeats including Liverpool’s 5-0 ransacking of Old Trafford and Manchester City’s 2-0 stroll at the same venue. With United languishing nine points adrift of first place, Solskjaer had to endure fresh reports this week that the club’s owners the Glazer family have started making plans to replace the Norwegian.  Work in progress Steven Gerrard is one of the Premier League’s iconic figures after his glittering playing career with Liverpool, but his reputation as a manager is still a work in progress — making his decision to take charge of struggling Aston Villa a major gamble. In his first managerial role, Gerrard spent three and a half years restoring Rangers to its current status as Scottish champion. But proving himself in the Premier League is essential for Gerrard as he eyes an eventual move to Liverpool.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/liverpool-to-test-arsenal-revival/article37591368.ece
20 November 2021||Galle,||West Indies eyes elusive Test win in Sri Lanka||A resurgent West Indies is aiming for its first Test victory in Sri Lanka from Sunday, having failed to win on the island in three decades of trying. In 11 attempts it has lost seven games and drawn four. Even when Brian Lara hammered 688 runs in a three-Test series in 2001, it still lost 3-0. But the West Indies has had a decent year in Test cricket, having beaten Bangladesh away and drawn home series against Sri Lanka and Pakistan. Its win over Pakistan in Jamaica in August gave it the first points in the World Test Championship, while Sri Lanka is yet to open its account. Jermaine Blackwood, one of the most experienced players in the side with 41 Test appearances, was confident of recording the elusive Test win in the two-match series. Both games are in Galle, but without spectators. “We came here to win. Our guys are hungry and you can see that in their eyes,” Blackwood told reporters. “We are a decent team and we are ready to break the shackles and win games this time around,” he said.  West Indies defeated Bangladesh in February where conditions were similar, with tracks that kept low and turned, allowing spinners to come on early. “Sri Lanka have quality spinners but we are ready for the challenge. If you see the series in Bangladesh when we won, it was played on similar conditions and we tackled their spinners well. Most of the guys who played in that series are here and we know what to expect,” Blackwood said. Sticking to experience In white ball, Sri Lanka has axed half a dozen senior players but for Tests, the Lions are sticking with experience, particularly with a tough tour of India due in February. Skipper Dimuth Karunaratne, former captains Angelo Mathews, Dinesh Chandimal and Suranga Lakmal are back in the squad and they are expected to play in both matches. “(Karunaratne’s) last knock in Test cricket was a double hundred. Angelo is one of the great players in the game. “Suranga Lakmal is so crucial for us with the new ball and he is a wonderful player,” coach Mickey Arthur said. “It’s great to have them back and their experience is going to be vital.” Former Sri Lanka Under-19 captain Charith Asalanka is tipped to make his Test debut at his hometown after an impressive T-20 World Cup. Arthur’s swansong Arthur will want to sign off on a high note as this is his last assignment with Sri Lanka. He is immensely popular in the island after he brought the best out of a young team during the T20 World Cup and was seeking an extension of his two-year contract. But Sri Lanka Cricket had other ideas, and Arthur is upping sticks for English county Derbyshire starting next season. “I am happy I am leaving the team in a far better place than I found it. I see our players getting better and exciting times are ahead,” Arthur said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/west-indies-eyes-elusive-test-win-in-sri-lanka/article37591365.ece
20 November 2021||Madrid,||Barcelona feels the belief again||After 2,373 days away, Xavi Hernandez will be back with Barcelona for a match at Camp Nou on Saturday and he can expect a hero’s welcome. Xavi’s return as coach was confirmed at the start of the international break but two weeks has done nothing to dim the crackle of excitement ahead of his opening game on the bench. Almost 10,000 fans, at 1pm on a Monday, attended a presentation with club president Joan Laporta last week, when Xavi’s attempts to thank the crowd were thwarted by the sound of them chanting his name. Laporta will hope more than eight times that number will be in the stands on Saturday when Barcelona faces neighbour Espanyol, the club whose claim to a rivalry has historically been only geographical but which now finds itself level on points with Barca in La Liga. Slide from elite It is another reminder of Barcelona’s slide away from the elite. It is ninth, already 10 points behind Real Madrid in second and, more pressingly, six adrift of Atletico Madrid in fourth. Averting the financial disaster of missing out on Champions League qualification will be Xavi’s first priority between now and May. It has conceded more goals than Espanyol and Rayo Vallecano, both of whom have just come up from the second division. It has won none of its last four league games. There is unlikely to be the option of a quick-fix either, with the club still desperately trying to reduce record debts of more than a billion euros.  Barca’s chief executive Mateu Alemany said on Wednesday that “as it stands there is nothing left” for signings in the January transfer window. Yet Xavi’s return, for a while at least and certainly on Saturday, momentarily pushes all that into the background. Dismay at the club’s decline and Lionel Messi’s departure can be forgotten. When Xavi played his 765th match for Barcelona and his last at Camp Nou on May 23, 2015, he was substituted in the 86th minute and walked off to a standing ovation.   Shorn of stars A Barca side shorn of stars and now relying on a handful of talented youngsters has generally played to an atmosphere of gentle encouragement.  Xavi’s return reignites the spark, through nostalgia and hope more than anything else, but the result this weekend at least will be a club that believes again. Real Sociedad, the league leader, plays at home to Valencia on Sunday after Real Madrid faces struggling Granada at Los Carmenes. Earlier on Saturday, Sevilla hosts Alaves and Atletico Madrid is at home to Osasuna.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/barcelona-feels-the-belief-again/article37591370.ece
20 November 2021||Bali,||Sindhu marches into semifinals||P.V. Sindhu and K. Srikanth posted dominant victories and entered the semifinals at the Indonesia Masters Super 750 badminton tournament here on Friday. While reigning World champion Sindhu, seeded third, scripted a 21-13, 21-10 win over Turkey’s Neslihan Yigit in 35 minutes in the women’s quarterfinals, Srikanth made short work of compatriot H.S. Prannoy 21-7, 21-18 in the men’s last eight fixture. With the win two-time Olympic medallist Sindhu extended her head-to-head record against the Turk to 4-0. The 26-year-old from Hyderabad, ranked seven, had beaten Yigit last month as well in the Denmark Open. In the men’s event, former World No. 1 Srikanth was at his vintage best and gave away just seven points in a lop-sided first game. The second game was more evenly matched as Prannoy, who claimed an upset win over Tokyo Olympics gold medallist Victor Axelsen earlier, made a strong recovery.  The results (quarterfinals): Women: P.V. Sindhu bt Neslihan Yigit (Tur) 21-13, 21-10.   Men: K. Srikanth bt H.S.

20 November 2021||Dhaka,||India bags two silvers||Indian recurve archers picked up three more medals at the Asian archery championships here on Friday. The Indian men and women’s teams lost to top-seeded Korea to take silver medals, while the mixed team got the better of Uzbekistan to gather a bronze on the final day of the championships. Pravin Jadhav, Kapil and Parth Salunkhe went down to Korea 6-2 (57-52, 55-53, 54-56, 57-55) in the men’s team final. The Indians fought back to close the gap to 4-2 in the third set, but the Koreans, comprising Woo Tack Han, Pil-Joong Kim and Seungyun Lee, produced another brilliant set to win the contest. India — Ankita Bhakat, Ridhi and Medhu Vedwan — lost to Korea 6-0 (57-52, 59-49, 60-56) in a lopsided women’s team final. The Indian women were inconsistent as each of them shot a 7 and an 8. The duo of Ankita and Kapil gave India a bronze medal in the mixed team event. They defeated the Uzbek pair of Ziyodakhon Abdusattorova and Amirkhan Sadikov 6-0 (35-32, 37-32, 36-35). Overall, the Indian contingent collected one gold, four silver and two bronze medals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-bags-two-silvers/article37591116.ece
20 November 2021||Coimbatore,||Can Vishnu Prasad light up the track yet again?||After a stellar show in the season’s opening round last month, Vishnu Prasad of Team MSport will look to carry his good form into the second round of the 24th JK Tyre FMSCI National Racing Championship which begins at the Kari Motor Speedway here on Saturday. The right balance The 34-year-old from Chennai heads the premier Formula LGB4 championship standings with 21 points. Vishnu loves to go flat out from lights to flag, but a slip-up may prove costly. He knows that well and will look to race with a mix of caution and aggression. Bengaluru’s Sohil Shah is just six points behind his teammate. He will be keen to press the pedal hard from here. Kottayam’s Amir Sayed (Ahura Racing), who made a clean sweep in the Novice class last season, is beginning to find his form. Big boys The big boys of Dark Don Racing such as A. Sandeep Kumar and Ashwin Datta (both Chennai) and T.S. Diljith (Thrissur) are equally fit and capable of pulling off upsets. Anish Damodar Shetty (Hubli) and Allwin Xavir (Thrissur) also showed off their might in the JK Tyre Royal Enfield Continental GT Cup, which made its debut in the opening round. After having had a good test and racing time with the heavy bikes last month, the duo will look to go full throtttle. And, that’s going to add to the excitement for the spectators. Ruhaan sitting pretty Ruhaan Alva of Bengaluru is the lad to beat in the JK Tyre Novice Cup. He showed signs of great class on both days in the opener and has a good chance to finish on top again. There will be three races each of the JK Tyre FLGB4 & JK Tyre Novice Cup and, two of the JK Tyre presents RE Continental GT Cup over the weekend.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/can-vishnu-prasad-light-up-the-track-yet-again/article37591166.ece
20 November 2021||KOLKATA,||Arjun underlines his class in rapid section||The odds of Arjun Erigaisi winning the Tata Steel Chess weren’t much different from those of Emma Raducanu claiming her maiden Grand Slam singles at the US Open tennis a couple of months ago. He did a Raducanu at the National Library here on Friday. The 18-year-old from Telangana won the rapid event of the Tata Steel Chess, finishing ahead of stronger and more fancied players. The new emerging star of Indian chess could not have announced his arrival in a more emphatic fashion, as he won the 10-player, round-robin event by one full point. Levon Aronian of Armenia, the top seed and Arjun’s opponent in the final round, had to settle for the second place, as he finished with 5.5 points, the same as R. Praggnanandhaa and Vidit Gujrathi. Getting the right move Aronian, though, had seemed on course for a win in that crucial game, but, playing from the white side of a Petroff Defence, he messed it up with a series of weak moves. Arjun, however, still had to find the right moves — sometimes the only one — to get the draw he needed. He did, like his 41st move with the queen, which ensured that he would get the half-the-point and the biggest title of his career yet. The game ended six moves later with the repetition of moves. Earlier in the day, he drew with Gujrathi and B. Adhiban, in contrasting styles. While he had to battle it out for 45 moves with Adhiban, he and Gujrathi split the point after just 12. Like Raducanu had to extend her stay in New York — she had booked her flight home after the qualifying round — Arjun will stay back for the blitz section, replacing an unwell Adhiban, who has withdrawn.  The results (Indians unless specified): Ninth round: B. Adhiban lost to Le Quang Leim (Vie); Vidit Gujrathi drew with Sam Shankland (USA); Levon Aronian (Arm) drew with Arjun Erigaisi; Parham Maghsoodloo drew with R, Vaishali; R. Praggnanandhaa drew with Karthikeyan Murali.   Eighth round: Liem drew with Praggnanandhaa; Karthikeyan bt Maghsoodloo; Vaishali drew with Aroninan; Arjun drew with Gujrathi; Shankland drew with Adhiban.   Seventh round: Shankland bt Liem; Adhiban drew with Arjun; Gujrathi bt Vaishali; Aronian drew with Karthikeyan; Maghsoodloo drew with Praggnanandhaa.   Final standings: 1. Arjun 6.5; 2-4. Aronian, Praggnanandhaa and Gujrathi 5.5; 5-6. Karthikeyan and Shankland 5; 7, Maghsoodloo 4.5; 8. Liem 4; 9. Adhiban 2; 10.

Navjot Kaur and youngster Suman Devi Thoudam have been chosen as alternative players. “Despite some injuries and senior players joining the under-21 team for the Junior World Cup in South Africa, I feel we have selected a good team. This tournament will be a good opportunity for some young players to get a taste of the highest international level,” said chief coach Janneke Schopman. “I am sure the expectations are high after our success at the Tokyo Olympics but we all start at zero again,” he said.

20 November 2021||November 20 2021 00:00 IST,||ATK Mohun Bagan proves too good for Kerala Blasters||Last year’s runner-up ATK Mohun Bagan showed fine form to overcome the challenge of former finalist Kerala Blasters convincingly (4-2) in the opening match of the Indian Super League’s season eight, at Fatorda, on Friday. Hugo Boumous made his debut for ATK MB with a pair of goals while Roy Krishna (penalty) and Liston Colaco scored one each. Samad Abdul Sahal and Pereyra Diaz scored were the scorers for Blasters. In attack mode The ATKT MB was in attack mode from the word go as Boumous converted his team’s first attack into a goal with a fine angular finish. There was a hint of controversy as Krishna appeared to be interfering with the shot coming from an off-side position. The referee thought otherwise and upheld the goal.  Boumous, the Frenchman who tormented ATK MB last season with his creativity for champion Mumbai City FC, used his arsenal to good effect, switching over to the former in this edition. Glimse of talent Sahal gave a glimpse of his talent as he scored the equaliser for Blasters with a nice finish in the 24th minute. The scoreline was altered soon as Krishna, who was tripped inside the box by Blasters goalkeeper Albino Gomes, found the net from the resultant penalty in the 27th minute (2-1). ATK MB consolidated the lead in the 39th minute when Boumous breached the Blasters defence again to make it 3-1. The change of ends did not alter the balance much and ATK MB made it 4-1 in the 50th minute when Colaco came up with a world-class finish. Blasters pulled one back in the 69th minute through Argentine Pereyra Diaz but it was not enough.  The result: ATK Mohun Bagan 4 (Boumous 3, 39, Krishna 27-pen, Colaco 50) bt Kerala Blasters 2 (Sahal 24, Diaz 69) .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/atk-mohun-bagan-proves-too-good-for-kerala-blasters/article37591058.ece
20 November 2021||November 20 2021 00:00 IST,||BFC looks to put heartbreak behind||Bengaluru FC will look to put two seasons of disappointment behind as it begins its 2021-22 Indian Super League (ISL) campaign against NorthEast United FC at Bambolim in Goa on Saturday. Last season was especially hard, as the club finished seventh, largely playing uninspiring and one-dimensional football. Unsurprisingly Marco Pezzaiuoli, the new head coach, has made “playing a better kind of football” his target. The squad has changed significantly. Four first-choice starters in defenders Rahul Bheke and Juanan, and midfielders Dimas Delgado and Erik Paartalu have moved on. The foreign-player roster, except for Cleiton Silva, is brand new. The side will thus revolve once again around Sunil Chhetri. The 37-year-old forward is still fit as a fiddle, but he will need much more support from his fellow attackers than last year. Udanta Singh, once marked out for great things, has plateaued, and will be keenly watched. So will the role of Congolese striker Prince Ibara, as BFC looks to recapture its once ferocious firepower upfront. NEUFC, however, is no pushover. The Khalid Jamil-coached side finished third last season and has managed to hold on to its most creative player in Federico Gallego. The addition of Hernan Santana, a defensive mainstay in the title-winning Mumbai City FC side last season, will also help. But the absence of Lalengmawia ‘Apuia’, will be felt, with the midfielder moving to Mumbai after an outstanding 2021-22 campaign. Hard work is something Jamil swears by. He will need all of it and more from his wards.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bfc-looks-to-put-heartbreak-behind/article37591059.ece
20 November 2021||Ranchi,||‘Harshal a skilful bowler’||India skipper Rohit Sharma praised debutant Harshal Patel, who won the match-of-the-match award for his outstanding two for 25 in the second T20I against New Zealand here on Friday. “Harshal has done the job many times... He knows what he needs to execute, and is a very skilful bowler,” Rohit said in the post-match presentation ceremony. Rohit was unfazed by New Zealand’s dazzling start with the bat, stating that he “kept telling the bowlers that it is just about getting one wicket” to break the momentum. New Zealand captain Tim Southee explained that his side was outplayed, irrespective of the dew factor. “We knew it was going to be wet when we came to the ground. We knew that dew would be a factor, but India was too good tonight,” Southee said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/harshal-a-skilful-bowler/article37591077.ece
20 November 2021||AUCKLAND,||Australia handles NZ swing bowling better than India: Hesson||Denying claims that New Zealand has a “phobia “of facing its Trans-Tasman rival, former coach Mike Hesson said Australia is simply good at countering swing bowling, something that India struggles with. New Zealand lost the T20 World Cup final to Australia last week. It was reminiscent to the 2015 ODI World Cup final’s defeat to the same opponent. “I guess we’ve only really had two big occasions haven’t we (recently), the 2015 World Cup and this one in terms of finals,” Hesson told ‘SEN NZ’, when asked if the Kiwis have a “phobia” of the Australians in cricket terms. “We’ve beaten them a heck of a lot in Chappell-Hadlees over the last six or seven years, and we’ve basically retained it the majority of the time.” India, on the other hand, has a poor record versus New Zealand in major International Cricket Council (ICC) events stretching back to 18 years. Poor record India’s seven-wicket win in the 2003 World Cup under Sourav Ganguly was the last time it beat the Kiwis in an ICC tournament. The Men in Blue recently lost to the Kiwis in the T20 World Cup and the World Test Championship final earlier this year. They were also knocked out by Kane Williamson and Co. in the 2019 ODI World Cup semifinals. The 47-year-old also shed light on why New Zealand fare so well against India in ICC tournaments. “Each side has got better match-ups than others. We obviously do very well against India, Australia struggles against India. “I think it’s just the way the side’s match-up against each other from a skill perspective, what we’re good at facing and what they’re good at facing. “Australia tends to deal with our swing bowling a lot better than the Indians do. So, I think it’s more match-up than phobia from my perspective.” Hesson, who guided New Zealand to the final of the 2019 ODI World Cup, feels the Australian players also have more experienced of playing matches at the big stage than their Kiwi counterparts. “I think we’re okay in bi-laterals, it’s when we get to a big stage and more of their players have potentially played more big matches, but I don’t think necessarily there’s a phobia.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/australia-handles-nz-swing-bowling-better-than-india-hesson/article37591363.ece

20 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Women footballers interact with fans||In a first for women’s football in India, young fans got a chance to interact with the players from the national team in a virtual meeting before they departed for an exposure tour of Brazil. Sanju Yadav and Indumathi Kathiresan took time out for 10 fans who were eager to speak to them and wish the team. The virtual meeting was not only a unique opportunity for fans, but it also gave the players a chance to witness first-hand the support and love from the followers as they gear up to to face Brazil (Nov. 25), Chile (Nov. 28) and Venezuela (Dec. 1). Midfielder Indumathi said: “All of us are working hard and excited about the tour of Brazil. We are especially looking forward to playing against Marta and learning from her.” Sanju expressed happiness about the disciplined training under new coach Thomas Dennerby. When a seven-year-old girl talked about boys in the playground telling her that football is not for girls, Indumathi replied, “when I was playing at the state-level, people often told me that this is a sport for boys, not girls. Even at home, they used to ask me why are you playing a boys’ game? But nobody can tell you that this is not a girls’ game, and for that, we have to go out there and show them”. When a budding woman footballer asked Sanju how she made it from Haryana’s Bhiwani to the National team, she highlighted the importance of family support. “I first played football at school,” said the 23-year-old midfielder. “I soon developed interest and started going out to play regularly. In the beginning, my family had no idea about it but when I started coming home late, they found out that I was playing football. “Since that day, they have never stopped me. Till date, getting selected for that first Indian camp remains the most special moment of my career.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/women-footballers-interact-with-fans/article37591366.ece

20 November 2021||Beijing,||WTA chief threatens to pull out of China||The head of the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) says he is willing to pull tournaments out of China if tennis star Peng Shuai remains unaccounted for and her sexual assault allegations not investigated. Peng, a former Wimbledon and French Open doubles champion, alleged on Chinese social media earlier this month that former vice-premier Zhang Gaoli had “forced” her into sex during a long-term on-off relationship. The claims were quickly scrubbed from the Twitter-like Weibo platform and the 35-year-old has not been seen since, drawing mounting concern over her well-being. Since then the WTA has called for proof that she is safe and a growing number of tennis stars have been drawing attention to Peng’s case, including Naomi Osaka, Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams. WTA boss Steve Simon told CNN he was willing to lose hundreds of millions of dollars worth of business in the lucrative China market to ensure Peng’s safety. “We’re definitely willing to pull our business and deal with all the complications that come with it,” Simon said. “Because this is certainly, this is bigger than the business. Women need to be respected and not censored.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/wta-chief-threatens-to-pull-out-of-china/article37591665.ece
20 November 2021||Milan,||Inter awaits leader Napoli||Inter Milan’s defence of its Serie A title will be tested again on Sunday as it awaits league leader Napoli hoping to close the seven-point gap between itself and top spot. Simone Inzaghi’s side trails both Napoli and city rival AC Milan, both unbeaten and cheek by jowl at the summit, after a series of big matches marked by missed chances and gutting refereeing decisions. Inter drew its derby with Milan before the international break. Now it hosts Napoli in front of a sold out San Siro with a chance to claw back some of the ground it lost with its draw with Juventus and collapse at Lazio last month.

Bhattar says She holds in Her left hand a bow made of sugarcane. In Her right hand, She holds arrows made of five flowers — lotus, flower of the mango tree, Asoka, the jasmine variety known as mullai in Tamil and neelothpala (blue water lily). This is a symbolic indication that if we worship Her, She keeps us from falling prey to worldly attractions, said M. A. Manickavelu in a discourse. In other words, She helps us control our senses. The sugarcane bow has a symbolic significance too. The tip of the sugarcane has a salty taste. It is only as one moves lower down that one can taste the sweetness. In the same way, if we study the attributes of Ambal superficially, we will not realise Her fully. The more we delve into the philosophy that Sakthi embodies, the greater will be our joy and our jnana. We must study the works of great saints who have extolled Her; we must contemplate on Her; we must meditate with Ambal in focus. Only then will we realise that She alone can lead us out of the bonds of samsara. Kama, the god of love, also holds a sugarcane bow and arrows made of five flowers. But while his arrows evoke desires in us, Ambal’s arrows free us from desires. Ganesa, the son of Parvathi, has the pasa and ankusa in his hands. Pasa is a looped coil of rope, and the ankusa is the instrument used by mahouts to control elephants. It was Goddess Tripurasundari who gave these weapons to Her son Ganesa. The Goddess holds these weapons in Her hands. They show that She helps Her followers achieve self-control in a world full of temptations. Abirami Bhattar praises the Goddess as Tripurasundari. She is the Consort of Tripurantaka.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/abiramis-bow-and-arrows/article37590824.ece

20 November 2021||November 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Inside Lin-Manuel Miranda’s meta musical||In Lin-Manuel Miranda’s world, throwing a shoe at a performer is the highest form of praise. For early rehearsals of Tick, Tick... Boom! , lead actor Andrew Garfield was not exempt from the custom. Miranda laughs at the memory and says, “I wasn’t aiming at him, just to be clear. It’s just choir! When someone has a killer solo, you take off your shoe, chuck it and go ‘damn it, that’s amazing!’ It started with In The Heights [his 2005 musical] , and that’s what I do when I run out of words to express myself.” Miranda, 41, is all smiles over a video interview as he gears up for the world to watch his feature film directorial debut . The stage-to-screen adaptation follows the late Jonathan Larson during one of his most vulnerable moments as a playwright and composer. Set in a 90s New York of curly-coiled telephone cords and oversized trench coats, Tick, Tick... Boom! is a musical within a musical. It narrates how Larson, after working for eight arduous years on his dystopian rock musical Superbia , had to eventually give up his dream. Audiences follow his story of creative loss, financial woes, and personal turmoil as he races towards a deadline — the metronomical tick, tick, tick — to put together a workshop for the musical, as he nears his 30-year milestone.  Message in a bottle  Even after his passing in 1996, Larson’s legacy as a game-changer for American theatre holds strong, and Miranda hopes no one ever forgets it. It was after watching Rent — the rock musical that won Larson three posthumous Tony Awards and a posthumous Pulitzer Prize for Drama — as a 17-year-old, that Miranda realised he, too, could write a play and have a diverse cast in a Broadway show. When he watched Tick, Tick... Boom! in its Off-Broadway incarnation in 2001, his final year of college, he “loved that it was not about the story of writing Rent or of a guy writing his masterpiece. It felt like a private message in a bottle from Jonathan, that said ‘This is harder than you think it’s going to be, but it’s worth it if you really love it.’ It was scary and incredibly clarifying for me”. Miranda enjoyed Tick, Tick... Boom! so much that he ended up playing Larson in the 2014 Encores! Off-Centre Revival. That said, he hopes the Netflix film, which released on November 19, will be “a whole new homing beacon for artistes questioning whether they are pursuing the right path”. Because it is, ultimately, a love letter to American theatre — as was Miranda’s magnum opus Broadway show, Hamilton . The ripple effect of the 2015 production (which raked in $30 million in advance ticket sales alone) was global; people in other countries booked flights to New York just so they could watch the rap musical, which follows the story of USA founding father, Alexander Hamilton. Disney+ later inked a deal with Miranda to get a filmed version on the platform and it proved successful: between July 3 and 13, 2020, more than 2.7 million households streamed it.  More power to musicals  The post- Hamilton boom has ignited a new appreciation for musicals everywhere. Miranda has always believed that “musicals are like real life, but better”. He tells me: “Wouldn’t it be wonderful to live in a world where you can break into song and express your heart’s desires, and you have just the right lyrics to express how you’re feeling in that moment? So often, most of the best lyrics I write are things I wished I would’ve thought of at that time, or it’s that thought expressed that I can’t find the answer to in my real life.” Musicals offer us a way to do that. “Basically,every project I’ve done since Hamilton has been the film school I could never afford,” says the composer, for whom it has been an illustrious six years in the film industry so far. He has worked with Rob Marshall on Mary Poppins Returns (2018), produced Fosse/Verdon (2019) with Tommy Kail, and shadowed John M Chu when he directed the 2020 film In The Heights (the earliest draft of the stage musical was written by Miranda in 1999). His new projects include South America’s first Disney feature film, Encanto , and the Halle Bailey-starrer The Little Mermaid .  Fearless Garfield  For Tick, Tick... Boom! , it made sense that Miranda would want to work with like-minded people, needing “a theatre animal” to play Larson. In 2017, Garfield’s emotive portrayal of Prior Walter in the six-hour production Angels of America at the National Theatre in London, caught his eye. Trained by vocal coach Liz Caplan, The Amazing Spider-Man star was encouraged to think about singing in a new way, which worked well. “Liz is not someone who says ‘this is how you sing’ but rather ‘what’s blocking you from singing?’ Andrew had an inherent musicality that had barriers, and it was amazing watching, during reading after reading, how he would sing a little more and louder,” Miranda says. He conveys nothing but “amazed respect” for the actor who frequents biopic roles, but not many of the musical sort. “These notes are hard for even the most seasoned of singers to pull off, and he got himself there. I saw my job as providing him the runway and resources for him to do whatever he needed to do.”  For the love of Larson  Like few others in the industry, Miranda — who is one Oscar away from EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony) status — understands the weighted responsibilities of adaptations, particularly those of the stage-to-screen variety. That said, the story of Tick, Tick... Boom! has been foundational to Miranda’s career and life, given there is a strong parallel to the sentimental value of In The Heights . “I still feel connected to those times of not knowing if I was going to pay my rent; I needed teachers to get sick so that I could get enough substitute teaching gigs to do so. That was my main job while I was in my first theatre show In The Heights ,” he shares. “But there is real wisdom in that lesson.” As expected, the film builds upon the original story to aid Larson’s journey, and Miranda worked with screenwriter Steven Levenson to bring even more humanity to it, to the point where audiences leave pondering the bigger picture of the pursuit of happiness. He also wanted to be as close to Larson as possible — speaking with Ira Weitzman, who had fought with Larson over production issues; Roger Bart, who sang backup for the one-man show of Tick, Tick... Boom! ; composer Steven Sondheim (who was also a mentor to Miranda); Matt O’Grady (his best friend) and even past girlfriends. “They knew we weren’t going for sainthood in making this movie, given it is semi-autobiographical,” he points out. Miranda wanted to create the right world for this intimate story, sourcing the very furniture that sat in Larson’s closet-sized apartment. He also wanted the film to be a springboard for Larson’s other music that the world never got to hear. He hoped that, if the film was done right, the credits would read ‘score by Jonathan Larson’, owing to the incidental music such as the background score in the diner scenes or the dialogue scenes between him and other characters. For example, in a scene of Michael and Jonathan driving, one can hear a talk-radio theme song which Larson wrote for CNN which the network never wound up buying.  Taking the hard road  As Miranda delves into the essence of the story, he talks with his hands as though he is physically unravelling how intricate and intimate the story of Larson is. “It’s the story of a guy spending years writing a show no one got to see. What do you take out of that? Well, the first is you write a show called Tick, Tick... Boom! and say, ‘No one is making my things!’ [Laughs] So much of Tick, Tick... Boom! is inadvertently a portrait of this great young man while he was still finding his voice — and you really feel his influences here.” He motions to his left, offering examples: “This sounds like the work of composer Steven Sondheim,” and then to his right, “The structure is similar to Company and Sunday in the Park w ith George ,” then brings it forward, “And then you hear songs and think ‘This sounds like Rent but it’s not Rent yet!’ I’m thinking of the song ‘ No More ’, which could be a ‘ Rent B-side’ — maybe it was!” He settles down and ponders before concluding, “I get hopeful with stories like that; this guy hasn’t even started writing Rent yet and he was able to find the inner resources to get back on the horse, get back at the piano, and start again. And that’s a lesson we are always learning.” Continued on page 3||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/inside-lin-manuel-mirandas-meta-musical/article37591033.ece
20 November 2021||November 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Taking the wheel||It’s a cold November evening in London when Rosamund Pike steps on to the blue carpet at the BFI IMAX in Waterloo. Dressed in a hooded sheer white toga-style Christian Dior silk gown and bodysuit, the Oscar nominee looks like she’s just magicked herself there from the White Tower of Tar Valon, the seat of the mighty Aes Sedai in The Wheel of Time series. Quite fitting for the British actor who plays Moiraine Damodred, a powerful magic-user from author Robert Jordan’s 14-book high fantasy — who upends the lives of five youngsters in her quest to find the Dragon Reborn, a messiah of sorts to stop the ultimate evil. Pike is the last to arrive at the premiere of the new Amazon Prime Video series, but also one of the most anticipated. Her remark about how you’ll see “more naked men than naked women” in the show “which is quite pleasing, since women have been asked to expose themselves forever and a day” has already been doing the rounds online. At the time, she was responding to the inevitable comparisons with Game of Thrones . Though the Gone Girl actor’s blue carpet appearance is brief, she finds time to tell me that it’s the representation of gender that drew her to the series. “Usually a guide character in any fantasy book is a man, and here it was interesting to see a woman who changes the lives of people. So, in the spiritual sense, it came at the right time for me to explore a power outside of myself,” she says, adding, “The whole idea of channelling was also very appealing to me.” On the carpet Urban legend has it that The Wheel of Time series, which started shooting in Prague over two-and-a-half years ago, came about because Amazon’s Jeff Bezos wanted to create a fantasy that would surpass Game of Thrones’ success. What better then than an epic that has maintained its active fan base over 23 years, 14 volumes (with over 90 million copies sold worldwide), the death of the writer, and the completion of the saga by another writer using the notes and deathbed audio recordings that Jordan had made before he succumbed to a rare blood disease. The on-screen adaptation has been a Herculean task — condensing its thousands of characters, many nations, centuries of history and the sprawling geography. The common emotion on the blue carpet is excitement. I watch New Zealand actor Zoë Robins (who plays Nynaeve al’Meara, one of the five youngsters) in her off-shoulder lime green Valentino gown, as I wait my turn for a quick chat with Daniel Henney. The American actor — known for his roles in several Korean and Hollywood films, including Seducing Mr Perfect and X Men Origins: Wolverine — is stylishly dressed in a slim grey suit and black polo neck. He plays al’Lan Mandragoran, Moiraine’s warder, a magically-enhanced bodyguard of sorts, and admits he’s racing through the first book, Eye of the World. “I need to be up to speed as we are doing press,” he laughs, adding that he loves being a man in a woman’s world. “Following a powerful woman into the dark and to see where we end up, is special. And working with Pike is a challenge I am most excited about.” Correcting the gaze The fantasy tale is directed by a woman, a breakthrough of sorts for German cinematographer-director Uta Briesewitz, who is thrilled to be helming a show of this scale — an “opportunity reserved for male directors in the past”. Speaking about comparisons with The Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones, she says, “This is a show about women being in power and how they wield it. If we gave women opportunity we could get the world in balance.” With its diverse cast, inclusivity is a topic of discussion on the blue carpet. It brings to mind Pike’s recent interview with Radio Times, where she talked about receiving fan letters, where many men wrote to her about how the women in the stories “were role models for them growing up”. Amazon Prime Video has already confirmed season two, and shooting has begun. Meanwhile, season one premiered on November 19 to mixed reviews.

C ycle ,  which  premieres at the upcoming International Documentary and Short Film Festival of Kerala, is about systemic violence by the State against people of the forest.  Cheepatakadumka is named after a phrase Makhija’s father often used. It refers to a game like hide-and-seek or tag — ideal for a film that set out to speak about ‘that which must not be spoken, women’s sexuality’. “I tried not to be preachy. The film was born of conversations with Bhumika Dube [Teja in the film] and Ipshita Chakraborty Singh, from NSD, and hailing from small-town cities. Gender was one of the things we spoke about, and I asked them to throw all their experiences at me and see if we could structure a story. It was a very organic process,” says Makhija.

20 November 2021||November 20 2021 00:00 IST,||a tactile balm||These days, Priyamvada spends most of her time experimenting in the kitchen. Before you ask, it is not the recent lockdown obsessions of baking bread or preparing sourdough starters. Instead, watched over suspiciously by her cats, she brings to boil various concoctions of pomegranate, beetroot, turmeric, tea, and coffee. They are patiently stirred, each taken to a different level, all to create natural, beautiful hues for her sustainable hand-crafted knitwear range, Knitsanyasini. For the 26-year-old, the brand is a culmination of a journey that began when she was seven. “Growing up, I’ve seen my mother, grandmother and aunt knit. My mother would always experiment with knits, and my first experience with the needle was in third grade when she taught me how to hand-knit a scarf for a school project using the rib knit,” says the Pune-based artiste, who went on to pursue a degree in Knitwear Design from NIFT Chennai in 2013.  The upcycled collector  On graduating, she collected and then upcycled all the excess yarn from her family’s earlier knitting projects and her NIFT course. “My aunt and mother would knit winter sweaters and collected leftover yarns over the years. I took these along with the yarns that I had saved during my degree [primarily cotton, wool, acrylic, bamboo and linen blends] and started knitting.” In 2019, she kickstarted Knitsanyasini with hand-knit tube tops, camisoles and turtleneck sweaters. Her range now includes headbands, cardigans and pullovers crafted in relaxed, free flowing silhouettes using ethically-sourced organic wool and cotton, in addition to upcycled yarn. Bucking tropes In literature and in art, knitting is often associated with elderly women in rockers or practical housewives. Jo March of Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women describes it as something only a “poky old woman” would do. But it is a trope far removed from reality given how everyone from teens to those in their 30s have taken to the art form over the years. For instance, when the cameras zoomed in on British diver Tom Daley at the Tokyo Olympics this year, he was almost always knitting. His hobby made headlines, especially when he admitted how it helped him manage his anxiety. For Priyamvada — whose work was also featured on The Woolmark Company’s Instagram last year — knitting has become a mode of expression.  Only by hand  Explaining her process, she says she uses vegetables, fruits, leaves and roots for the dyes — something she picked up through her explorations in knitting. “It is inspired by traditional Indian fabric colouring techniques that leave no harmful by-products.” She likens the process of experimenting to ‘walking in the dark and finding colourful jewels along the way’ as it takes months of trial and error. Each natural ingredient is prepared according to its individual properties — for instance, marigold flowers and pomegranate skins would need to boil for varying durations so their optimal colour can be extracted. “The process of washing, drying, rolling and winding the yarn is done by hand. The only tools involved are basic kitchen utensils and my knitting needles,” says Priyamvada, adding that it takes anywhere between two weeks to a month to create a sweater. Referring to the last two years, she says the craft was a tactile balm to deal with all the uncertainty of multiple lockdowns. “It was a way to escape and find solace in my thoughts.”  Rs. 5,000 onwards on @knitsanyasini on Instagram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/a-tactile-balm/article37591001.ece

The collection of furniture, tableware, and soft furnishings derive inspiration from both travel and India’s diversity in equal measure. “I am a very visual person; I travel with my eyes,” begins Ashiesh. “These places [Amer and Jaisalmer in Rajasthan, and Kochi in Kerala] inspired me: the silhouettes of coconut trees, the camels of Jaisalmer.

20 November 2021||November 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Inside Lin-Manuel Miranda’s meta musical||In Lin-Manuel Miranda’s world, throwing a shoe at a performer is the highest form of praise. For early rehearsals of Tick, Tick... Boom! , lead actor Andrew Garfield was not exempt from the custom. Miranda laughs at the memory and says, “I wasn’t aiming at him, just to be clear. It’s just choir! When someone has a killer solo, you take off your shoe, chuck it and go ‘damn it, that’s amazing!’ It started with In The Heights [his 2005 musical] , and that’s what I do when I run out of words to express myself.” Miranda, 41, is all smiles over a video interview as he gears up for the world to watch his feature film directorial debut . The stage-to-screen adaptation follows the late Jonathan Larson during one of his most vulnerable moments as a playwright and composer. Set in a 90s New York of curly-coiled telephone cords and oversized trench coats, Tick, Tick... Boom! is a musical within a musical. It narrates how Larson, after working for eight arduous years on his dystopian rock musical Superbia , had to eventually give up his dream. Audiences follow his story of creative loss, financial woes, and personal turmoil as he races towards a deadline — the metronomical tick, tick, tick — to put together a workshop for the musical, as he nears his 30-year milestone.  Message in a bottle  Even after his passing in 1996, Larson’s legacy as a game-changer for American theatre holds strong, and Miranda hopes no one ever forgets it. It was after watching Rent — the rock musical that won Larson three posthumous Tony Awards and a posthumous Pulitzer Prize for Drama — as a 17-year-old, that Miranda realised he, too, could write a play and have a diverse cast in a Broadway show. When he watched Tick, Tick... Boom! in its Off-Broadway incarnation in 2001, his final year of college, he “loved that it was not about the story of writing Rent or of a guy writing his masterpiece. It felt like a private message in a bottle from Jonathan, that said ‘This is harder than you think it’s going to be, but it’s worth it if you really love it.’ It was scary and incredibly clarifying for me”. Miranda enjoyed Tick, Tick... Boom! so much that he ended up playing Larson in the 2014 Encores! Off-Centre Revival. That said, he hopes the Netflix film, which released on November 19, will be “a whole new homing beacon for artistes questioning whether they are pursuing the right path”. Because it is, ultimately, a love letter to American theatre — as was Miranda’s magnum opus Broadway show, Hamilton . The ripple effect of the 2015 production (which raked in $30 million in advance ticket sales alone) was global; people in other countries booked flights to New York just so they could watch the rap musical, which follows the story of USA founding father, Alexander Hamilton. Disney+ later inked a deal with Miranda to get a filmed version on the platform and it proved successful: between July 3 and 13, 2020, more than 2.7 million households streamed it.  More power to musicals  The post- Hamilton boom has ignited a new appreciation for musicals everywhere. Miranda has always believed that “musicals are like real life, but better”. He tells me: “Wouldn’t it be wonderful to live in a world where you can break into song and express your heart’s desires, and you have just the right lyrics to express how you’re feeling in that moment? So often, most of the best lyrics I write are things I wished I would’ve thought of at that time, or it’s that thought expressed that I can’t find the answer to in my real life.” Musicals offer us a way to do that. “Basically,every project I’ve done since Hamilton has been the film school I could never afford,” says the composer, for whom it has been an illustrious six years in the film industry so far. He has worked with Rob Marshall on Mary Poppins Returns (2018), produced Fosse/Verdon (2019) with Tommy Kail, and shadowed John M Chu when he directed the 2020 film In The Heights (the earliest draft of the stage musical was written by Miranda in 1999). His new projects include South America’s first Disney feature film, Encanto , and the Halle Bailey-starrer The Little Mermaid .  Fearless Garfield  For Tick, Tick... Boom! , it made sense that Miranda would want to work with like-minded people, needing “a theatre animal” to play Larson. In 2017, Garfield’s emotive portrayal of Prior Walter in the six-hour production Angels of America at the National Theatre in London, caught his eye. Trained by vocal coach Liz Caplan, The Amazing Spider-Man star was encouraged to think about singing in a new way, which worked well. “Liz is not someone who says ‘this is how you sing’ but rather ‘what’s blocking you from singing?’ Andrew had an inherent musicality that had barriers, and it was amazing watching, during reading after reading, how he would sing a little more and louder,” Miranda says. He conveys nothing but “amazed respect” for the actor who frequents biopic roles, but not many of the musical sort. “These notes are hard for even the most seasoned of singers to pull off, and he got himself there. I saw my job as providing him the runway and resources for him to do whatever he needed to do.”  For the love of Larson  Like few others in the industry, Miranda — who is one Oscar away from EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony) status — understands the weighted responsibilities of adaptations, particularly those of the stage-to-screen variety. That said, the story of Tick, Tick... Boom! has been foundational to Miranda’s career and life, given there is a strong parallel to the sentimental value of In The Heights . “I still feel connected to those times of not knowing if I was going to pay my rent; I needed teachers to get sick so that I could get enough substitute teaching gigs to do so. That was my main job while I was in my first theatre show In The Heights ,” he shares. “But there is real wisdom in that lesson.” As expected, the film builds upon the original story to aid Larson’s journey, and Miranda worked with screenwriter Steven Levenson to bring even more humanity to it, to the point where audiences leave pondering the bigger picture of the pursuit of happiness. He also wanted to be as close to Larson as possible — speaking with Ira Weitzman, who had fought with Larson over production issues; Roger Bart, who sang backup for the one-man show of Tick, Tick... Boom! ; composer Steven Sondheim (who was also a mentor to Miranda); Matt O’Grady (his best friend) and even past girlfriends. “They knew we weren’t going for sainthood in making this movie, given it is semi-autobiographical,” he points out. Miranda wanted to create the right world for this intimate story, sourcing the very furniture that sat in Larson’s closet-sized apartment. He also wanted the film to be a springboard for Larson’s other music that the world never got to hear. He hoped that, if the film was done right, the credits would read ‘score by Jonathan Larson’, owing to the incidental music such as the background score in the diner scenes or the dialogue scenes between him and other characters. For example, in a scene of Michael and Jonathan driving, one can hear a talk-radio theme song which Larson wrote for CNN which the network never wound up buying.  Taking the hard road  As Miranda delves into the essence of the story, he talks with his hands as though he is physically unravelling how intricate and intimate the story of Larson is. “It’s the story of a guy spending years writing a show no one got to see. What do you take out of that? Well, the first is you write a show called Tick, Tick... Boom! and say, ‘No one is making my things!’ [Laughs] So much of Tick, Tick... Boom! is inadvertently a portrait of this great young man while he was still finding his voice — and you really feel his influences here.” He motions to his left, offering examples: “This sounds like the work of composer Steven Sondheim,” and then to his right, “The structure is similar to Company and Sunday in the Park w ith George ,” then brings it forward, “And then you hear songs and think ‘This sounds like Rent but it’s not Rent yet!’ I’m thinking of the song ‘ No More ’, which could be a ‘ Rent B-side’ — maybe it was!” He settles down and ponders before concluding, “I get hopeful with stories like that; this guy hasn’t even started writing Rent yet and he was able to find the inner resources to get back on the horse, get back at the piano, and start again. And that’s a lesson we are always learning.” Continued on page 3||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/inside-lin-manuel-mirandas-meta-musical/article37590989.ece

20 November 2021||CHENNAI,||CMDA explores revenue-sharing model for three bus terminals||The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) is exploring a revenue-sharing model for the operation and maintenance of three bus terminals at Kilambakkam, Kuthambakkam and Madhavaram by granting concessionaire. The CMDA is exploring ways for the best utilisation of Puratchi Thalaivar Dr. MGR Bus Terminus (CMBT) and Chennai Contract Carriage Bus Terminus (CCCBT) (Omni Bus Stand) at Koyambedu after the operations of south- and west-bound buses are shifted to new bus terminals at Kilambakkam and Kuthambakkam respectively. The CMDA this week floated two tenders for selecting consultants to prepare the feasibility report for identifying concessionaire for operation and maintenance through revenue-sharing models for the three bus terminals. A senior official in the Housing and Urban Development Department said multiple options were being explored. “The CMDA intends to operate these terminals through the concessionaire(s)/conventional method for all operations and maintenance. The sources from where revenue can be generated are parking of vehicles and rent from restaurants, fast food courts, shops, dormitories, clinics and advertisements, among others,” one of the documents said. The selected consultant will prepare a contract where a third party will operate and manage the new bus terminals at Kilambakkam, Kuthambakkam and Madhavaram. An operation plan and a revenue model will be prepared after duly studying the CMBT experience, it said. 30-year projection “The financial model should provide projections over a 30-year period, for different scenarios, and indicate estimates towards operation and maintenance costs, replacement costs, provision for sinking fund, debt servicing, and so on,” it said. In line with the proposal made in the first Master Plan for CMA, the CMDA developed CMBT, an inter-city bus terminal, as part of decongestion strategy. Eventually, a satellite bus terminal at Madhavaram was constructed for north-bound buses, which has a parking capacity of 42 buses, 50 idle buses with two-wheeler, car parking, toilets, and restaurants, among others. The CMDA is constructing two new mofussil bus terminals in Kilambakkam near Vandalur for south-bound buses and one at Kuthambakkam for west-bound buses. The terminal at Kilambakkam in Chengalpattu district is being constructed over 67 acres of land at a cost of Rs. 314 crore and has a parking capacity of 216 buses, 250 idle buses with two-wheeler, car parking, toilets, restaurants, and so on. It is expected to be completed by March 2022. The terminal at Kuthambakkam in Tiruvallur, spread across 25 acres, is being constructed at Rs. 307 crore, and has a parking capacity of 100 buses and 80 idle buses. It is likely to be completed by October 2022.

20 November 2021||CHENNAI,||Directives issued to schools to ensure students’ safety||Following the heavy rain in several parts of the State, the Directorate of Elementary Education has issued directives to schools functioning under it, on steps to be taken to ensure student safety during monsoon. In a circular, the Director of Elementary Education has asked district-level officials, as well as school heads to remain vigilant and ensure that safety measures are implemented on campus. Since the school compound walls might be damp after the heavy rain, students have been asked to stay at least twenty feet away from it. School heads have been asked to ensure that students do not go near the walls and stay away from classrooms that were damaged due to the rain. Schools have further been asked to carry out an audit of all the electrical connections and switches, and to contact engineers for major damages to power connections. They have also been instructed to stay vigilant and ensure that open water sources on campus are covered, and that students remain at a distance from it and also from any ongoing construction work. Teachers have been asked to advise students to avoid visiting lakes or ponds during rain on holidays, and to avoid going outdoors during rough weather. Since students are vulnerable to diseases such as dengue and chikungunya during rain, schools can refer them to the nearest PHC or hospital if they are found to have such symptoms on campus. Schools in many districts have been shut for the last two days owing to the rain in Tamil Nadu. When they reopen, teachers and school heads have been instructed to carry out a safety audit to ensure that there is no damage to infrastructure and that the campus is safe for students. Chief Educational Officials have also been instructed to check for any structural damages that schools might have faced during the rain.

20 November 2021||TIRUCHI,||Govt. will set up complaint centres in schools: Minister||The State government is planning to print information about the toll-free '14417' counselling helpline on the front page of all school textbooks, School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi said here on Friday. Awareness of the helpline would help children reach out for help in time of need. As children are returning to schools after 19 months, awareness posters about child safety, the '14417' helpline and other such details would be placed in all schools, Mr. Poyyamozhi told reporters after inaugurating a workshop on child safety on the occasion of World Day for Prevention of Child Abuse. A central complaints centre, consisting of a dedicated team, would be set up. It will be a one-stop agency for the protection of children in each school. These arrangements will come into force with the soon-to-be-announced government order, he said. The School Education Department, with the help of other stakeholders, will strengthen School Management Committees so that they become a monitoring system in all schools. He urged school authorities to keep a child's safety in mind and take necessary action when needed. “Please do not try to cover up any incident with the motive of preserving the school's reputation,” the Minister said. Workshop for teachers A three-hour-long workshop for teachers and non-teaching staff from all schools in the district was organised by Tulir, a not-for-profit working towards child safety. Around 350 teachers who took part in the workshop would be able to impart the acquired information to their schools’ other staff and act as nodal officers of child safety in their respective schools. A similar workshop has been planned in Chennai on November 25.

K.M. Kader Mohideen, national president of the party, said Mr. Modi decided to withdraw the farm laws in spirit of goodwill, and he should adopt a similar approach and repeal the CAA. “The CAA is also a legislation that needs to be withdrawn as it caused turmoil across the country and resulted in the loss of several lives. The legislative process to repeal the three farm laws and the CAA should be adopted together in the Parliament,” he said. He said the announcement had come as a victory for the farmers’ long and steadfast struggle, during which many lives were lost. The Prime Minister deserves praise for giving up an obstinate approach and deciding to withdraw the laws, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/repeal-caa-too-iuml/article37591270.ece
20 November 2021||Madurai,||Mark my words: Rahul Gandhi’s remark on farm laws goes viral||“Mark my words … these (farm) laws… the government will be forced to take them back. Remember what I said!,” a short video clip of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, making this statement in January last has gone viral on social media after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced repeal of the three farm laws on Friday. Mr. Gandhi said these words while talking to the media at the Madurai Airport on Pongal Day after witnessing Jallikattu in nearby Avaniyapuram. “His statement is now a prophecy. What he said on the soil of Madurai has turned into reality,” said Virudhunagar MP and Congress Whip in Lok Sabha B. Manickam Tagore. “Another significance is that he had made the statement against the black laws on Pongal day, a harvest festival,” he added. Mr. Gandhi was firm on the issue and his statement only revealed that, said Mr. Tagore, adding that the farmers were very clear on their stand and the Congress backed them with conviction. Caution on COVID-19 “It is not his stand on farm laws alone that stands vindicated. His words of caution on the COVID-19 outbreak and the adverse impact of demonetisation have also turned out to be true,” Mr. Tagore said. The MP gave full credit to the farmers and their unrelenting protest for the announcement on the repeal of the three Central farm laws.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/mark-my-words-rahul-gandhis-remark-on-farm-laws-goes-viral/article37591274.ece
