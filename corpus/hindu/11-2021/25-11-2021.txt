25 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Centre’s free foodgrain scheme on till March||Acknowledging that poor families still need food security support in the middle of a recovering economy, the Centre has decided to extend its free ration scheme, Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY), for another four months, until March 2022. At its meeting on Wednesday, the Union Cabinet also gave its formal approval to repeal the three contentious farm reform laws in the upcoming winter session of Parliament, as announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week. “On [November] 19th, PM announced, and today, within five days, we have fulfilled all the formalities. In the upcoming winter session, the priority would be to take these Bills and repeal them at the earliest,” Information and Broadcasting Minister Anurag Thakur told presspersons in a briefing on Cabinet decisions. However, he evaded questions on the farmers’ continued demand for a legal guarantee on minimum support prices for their crops, and declined to set any timeline on the PM’s promise to set up a committee to make the MSP more effective and transparent, as well as to change crop patterns and promote zero-budget agriculture. In its other major decision, the Cabinet approved the extension of the PMGKAY which provides more than 80 crore ration card holders with five kg of rice or wheat per month free of cost, in addition to the five kg which they are already eligible for on a subsidised basis under the National Food Security Act. Initially introduced in the first COVID-19 relief package from April 2020, the scheme has been extended thrice, but was scheduled to end in November. Earlier this month, Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey had told presspersons that there was no proposal for extension as the economy was reviving. “In the last more than 20 months, we have seen that the poor, even the middle class families have suffered, not here but globally as well. One of the reasons to help the poor families was to give them foodgrains,” Mr. Thakur said. “We still feel as the economy is getting back on track, the figures are looking much better. At the same time, Prime Minister wants to help those poor families who have gone through this COVID-19 pandemic, so that for the next four months, they should be helped and food grains should be given to them,” the Minister added. In the run-up to the Uttar Pradesh Assembly election, the State Government had announced a unilateral extension of PMGKAY until March 2022.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/centres-free-foodgrain-scheme-on-till-march/article37675664.ece

25 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||More hospital births, but limited gains in childhood nutrition: NFHS||Births in institutional facilities, such as a hospital, improved by nearly eight percentage points but children who were either stunted or displayed signs of wasting only dropped by a maximum of three percentage points, shows a comparison of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 5 and 4. The complete results of the NFHS-5 were made public on Wednesday. The NFHS-4 was released in 2014-15 and the latest, which captured population health indicators in 2017-19, was delayed due to the pandemic. Growth under check India has also officially hit a Total Fertility Rate (TFR) of 2.0 that indicates a decrease from the 2.2 in the NFHS-4. According to the United Nations Population Division, a TFR of about 2.1 children per woman is called replacement-level fertility. If replacement level fertility is sustained over a sufficiently long period, each generation will exactly replace itself. The urban TFR is 1.6 and rural 2.1 “This is a significant feat for the country’s family-planning programme, which does not include coercive policies. These findings bust the population-explosion myth and show that India must steer away from coercive measures of population control. While the increase in the use of modern contraceptive methods is heartening, an increase in female sterilisation coupled with continued stagnation in male sterilisation uptake shows that the onus of family planning still lies with women,” the Population Foundation of India, a non-governmental organisation, said in a statement. An overall survey of the major differences between the NFHS-5 and NFHS-4 suggests that the use of contraceptives has improved from 53.5% to 66.7% in the latest NFHS-5 and institutional births increased from 78.9% to 88.6%. The proportion of children (12-23 months) who were fully vaccinated improved from 62%-76% and children under six months who were exclusively breastfed also showed a sharp improvement from 54.9% to 63.7%. There were, however, mixed signals in nutrition. Though the gains in childhood nutrition were minimal, women and men (15-49) who had a below normal body mass index (BMI) each dropped roughly four percentage points. Those overweight (or had a higher BMI than ideal) increased by around 4 percentage points. Abnormal BMIs are linked to an increase in obesity and other non-communicable diseases (NCD).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/more-hospital-births-but-limited-gains-in-childhood-nutrition-nfhs/article37675662.ece

The girl, eldest of the four children of a labourer couple working in the factory near Vamanjoor in Mangaluru Rural Police limits, was found dead in a drain on the factory premises on Sunday. The police said that Jayban, Mukesh Singh and Manish Tirki, who worked in the factory, were directly involved in the crime, while Muneem Singh helped them in raping the victim and throwing the body in the drain. Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar told reporters on Wednesday that the girl went missing at 1.30 p.m on Sunday. Her parents and other labourers, including two arrested persons, launched a search and found the girl dead in the drain at around 6 p.m. The Mangaluru Rural Police registered cases under Section 302 (murder) and 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code and under Sections 5 and 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.

25 November 2021||Vijayawada,||Decks cleared for online sale of movie tickets||The Legislative Assembly on Wednesday facilitated the much-debated online ticketing for movies and screening of only four shows per day by passing the AP Cinemas Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2021. The A.P. State Film, Television and Theatre Development Corporation will operate the online portal through which tickets will be sold. Payments will be made to the theatres on a daily basis through an RBI gateway. Tabling the Bill, Minister for Transport and Information and Public Relations Perni Venkataramaiah said it was intended to stop the exploitation of movie-goers, particularly the poor and middle classes for whom the price of tickets ranging from Rs. 300 to Rs. 500 was a big burden. Theatres screened up to seven shows a day starting from the early mornings against the permitted four, and sold tickets at exorbitant rates in the name of benefit shows, he said. Mr. Venkataramaiah said cinema tickets could be purchased as usual online, through mobile phones and at the theatres an hour in advance. However, the show timings would be fixed by the government. The Minister observed that there had been a huge mismatch between the cinema collections, the revenues claimed to be earned by producers and distributors and the GST payments made to the government. Once the online system went live, the government would know the quantum of taxes to be remitted to it, the Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/decks-cleared-for-online-sale-of-movie-tickets/article37675597.ece

Ramana, heading a Special Bench, orally asked Additional Solicitor-General S.V. Raju, appearing for the Centre. Mr. Raju said he had just been assigned the case and would need time to consult and formulate a response. But the Government, in an affidavit filed by the Law Ministry in the court in December 2020, had rejected the idea of a lifetime ban on convicted persons contesting elections or forming or becoming an office-bearer of a political party. The Ministry had reasoned that MPs and MLAs were not bound by specific “service conditions”. “They are bound by their oath to serve citizens and country... They are bound by propriety, good conscience and interest of the nation,” the Ministry had argued. The Centre had attempted to buttress its case last year by citing a Constitution Bench decision in the Public Interest Foundation case of 2019 which said “though criminalisation of politics is a bitter manifest truth, which is a termite to the citadel of democracy, be that as it may, the court cannot make the law”. In a separate case, the apex court said States have a large number of criminal cases pending against former and sitting legislators, and poll-bound Uttar Pradesh may host the “largest”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/will-you-ban-convicts-from-polls-sc-asks-govt/article37675697.ece

While inspecting Horamavu ward which was inundated on Sunday, Mr. Bommai said the government would work with railway officials to widen vents to allow free flow of water. The lack of road and drain infrastructure has become a sore point for citizens who pointed out that these issues crop up year after year with depressing regularity. On Wednesday, citizens’ group Varthur Rising submitted a memorandum to the BBMP highlighting the lack of proper roads in the area. To press their point home, many residents started cultivating crops on ‘roads’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-draws-up-plans-to-widen-rajakaluves-build-drains/article37675706.ece

25 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Private vaccine stocks near expiry date||Private hospitals in States such as Gujarat and Jharkhand could face wastage of COVID-19 vaccines as stocks approach the expiry date, Girdhar Gyani, director-general of the Association of Healthcare Providers (India), says. By the association’s survey, such a situation can arise as early as December if a mechanism to remedy this is not immediately put in place. “This is happening in the private healthcare sector. We are getting news from other parts of the country also about vaccine stocks nearing expiry date. The Union Health Ministry has given us this understanding that they may export the excess stock to prevent waste. We have approached the Ministry asking it to direct manufacturers to take back the excess stock and also look into making booster dose available for healthcare workers who were vaccinated early this year,” Mr. Gyani said. According to the Health Ministry, the States and the Union Territories have more than 21.65 crore balance and unutilised vaccine doses. Earlier, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation had agreed to extend Covaxin’s shelf life to 12 months from the manufacturing date. The existing shelf life is nine months, which is same as that of Covishield. The shelf life of Covishield was increased from six to nine months. Millions of doses Harsh Mahajan, president, NATHEALTH, a healthcare body which raises issues on access and quality of healthcare, said it was presumed that there was unused stock of between five and 10 million doses in the private sector. This stock would possibly start expiring from January or February 2022. Dr. Mahajan added that in case the expert committee of the Government decided that a booster dose was necessary, then this stock could be used for boosters for healthcare and frontline workers and those who were at higher risk. “The objective should be to minimise wastage of this precious resource,” he said. Bishnu Panigrahi, group head, Medical Strategy and Operations, Fortis Healthcare, said that while his hospital continued to administer vaccines across all its centres in India, the daily footfall was low. “So looking at this, we are ordering in a prudent manner, so that we are never overstocked. We are reviewing our vaccine stocks on a regular basis. We are also actively reaching out to people to take their second dose,” he said. Stating that it was important to coordinate the production, storage, cold chain and distribution of vaccines, Rajeev Jayadevan, member, national, Indian Medical Association task force on coronavirus and deputy medical director of Sunrise Hospitals, Kochi, said any imbalance in this process could lead to wastage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/private-vaccine-stocks-near-expiry-date/article37675576.ece
25 November 2021||Srinagar,||‘Militant behind school killings dead’||In a dramatic anti-militancy operation of the police, three “militants” including a wanted The Resistance Front (TRF) “commander”, were killed in a busy market in an uptown area of Rambagh in Srinagar on Wednesday evening. Eyewitnesses said policemen, many wearing civilian clothes, had laid an ambush on the busy Lal Chowk-Rambagh route and opened fire upon the men travelling in a car near Rambagh. Women were seen wailing and raising slogans on the roadside, as the street was splashed with blood. “A small team from the Srinagar police signalled a suspected Santro vehicle to stop. However, the terrorists started firing indiscriminately, while trying to flee under the cover of fire. The fire was, however, effectively retaliated. Three militants were killed in the operation,” Inspector-General of Police Vijay Kumar said. The police identified the slain as TRF “commander” Mehran Yaseen Shalla from Jamalatta here, Manzoor Ahmad Mir and Arafat Ahmad Sheikh from Pulwama. ‘Wanted commander’ According to the police, Mr. Shalla was behind the killing of Meeran Ali Sheikh, sub-inspector Arshad Ahmad, school principal Supinder Kour and teacher Deepak Chand in Srinagar. “Prior to joining the terror ranks, several cases regarding his involvement in stone pelting incidents are also registered against him. Mr. Sheikh was involved in the killing of a non-local labour at Litter area of Pulwama,” the police said. The police said they recovered incriminating material, including arms and ammunition, from them, without providing any details about it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/three-militants-gunned-down-in-jk/article37675556.ece
25 November 2021||New Delhi,||Don’t disturb federalism, Mamata to PM||The Centre must not disturb the federal structure, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee reportedly told Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday at a meeting in Delhi, flagging the expansion of the BSF’s jurisdiction in the border States. Ms. Banerjee has been demanding that the amendment to the BSF Act be withdrawn immediately. The Union Home Ministry, in a notification on October 11, amended the BSF Act of 1968 expanding its jurisdiction from 15 km to 50 km in border States. Though the BSF does not have policing powers, it can apprehend a suspect and conduct “preliminary questioning”. The seized consignment or suspect has to be handed over to the local police within 24 hours. West Bengal has a 2,216-km border with Bangladesh, and the ruling Trinamool Congress contends that the extension of jurisdiction will effectively bring nearly one-third of the State’s territory under BSF control. Of the 23 districts in the State, nearly 10 will be affected. This would have an impact on 21 of the 42 Lok Sabha constituencies, which can have larger political implications. Ms. Banerjee said she told the PM that if the law and order was solely a State subject and if this equilibrium was changed, then it would lead to an obvious confrontation. “Our country has an established federal structure. We are not against the BSF, I respect all agencies. But law and order is a State subject. Giving more powers will lead to a confrontation,” Ms. Banerjee told presspersons. She referred to incidents of recent encounters that the BSF has had in the State. “If you need more power to man the borders, then you should ask for the State Government’s help. But do not unnecessarily disturb the federal structure. This issue must be debated and the law must be withdrawn,” she said. Ms. Banerjee said she had invited the PM to inaugurate the Global Business Summit in West Bengal next year. She urged him to clear Rs. 96,000 crore in dues that the Centre owed the State. The Trinamool is trying to expand its footprint across the country and making a serious effort to dislodge the Congress from the position of the lead Opposition party. Asked if she will be meeting any other Opposition leaders, Ms. Banerjee said her Delhi visit was specifically to meet the Prime Minister. No meet with Sonia She snapped at reporters when asked why she was not meeting Congress president Sonia Gandhi, whose 10 Janpath house used to be a regular stop for her during every Delhi visit. “Why should I meet Sonia every time? It is not constitutionally mandated.” She said she had raised the issue of violence in Tripura where Trinamool workers were allegedly assaulted by BJP workers. On the Uttar Pradesh election, she said: “If Trinamool can help defeat the BJP in U.P., we will go… If Akhilesh [Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav] wants our help we will give.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dont-disturb-federalism-mamata-to-pm/article37675574.ece
25 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||MSP law required to tide over farm crisis: AIKS||Uttar Pradesh’s farmers face higher losses in comparison to their counterparts in Kerala, Punjab and even Jharkhand, due to the current regime of patchy procurement at minimum support prices which are not comprehensive, according to the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS). Farm unions are continuing their agitation calling for the ruling BJP to be voted out in Uttar Pradesh’s upcoming Assembly election, arguing that while the Centre’s repeal of farm laws will prevent future catastrophe, a new law guaranteeing comprehensive MSP rates for all farmers is needed to deal with the current agrarian crisis. “This struggle was never just about the repeal of the three black laws. The main problem is yet to be solved,” Ashok Dhawale, president of the Communist Party of India-affiliated AIKS, said on Wednesday, explaining why protesters are not going home yet. As part of the unions’ Mission-Uttar Pradesh campaign, the AIKS claimed that the prevailing market price of paddy in Uttar Pradesh was just Rs. 1,100 per quintal, lower than the Rs. 1,960 per quintal rate set by the Centre as MSP. Those are significantly lower than the Rs. 2,590 per quintal which would be the MSP if imputed costs of capital assets and rental on owned land was taken into account in calculating the cost of production as recommended by the Swaminathan Commission. In comparison, Jharkhand has a market rate of Rs. 1,200 per quintal, while Punjab’s farmers are able to sell their crops at MSP, and Kerala farmers benefit from a State bonus to sell at Rs. 2,800 per quintal. Across the country, only 8.6% of agricultural households cultivating paddy were able to sell their crop to a government agency at the set MSP rate, the AIKS noted. Several other major Uttar Pradesh crops do not benefit from the MSP regime at all, including potatoes, pulses and sugarcane. Although Uttar Pradesh is the country’s largest potato producer, its farmers sell their crop at Rs. 300 to 400 per quintal, while the vegetable retails at five to six times that amount, said the AIKS.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/main-issue-is-msp-says-aiks/article37675572.ece
25 November 2021||JAIPUR,||Vasundhara trip creates a desert storm for BJP||The tour of former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje of six districts in southern Rajasthan, mainly in the Mewar region, has created ripples in the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party in the aftermath of the recent State Assembly byelection, in which the party suffered a humiliating defeat. The visit is set to deepen the divide between rival factions in the State unit. Ms. Raje, also party national vice-president, is paying obeisance at some prominent temples in the region and visiting the families of the departed party leaders to offer her condolences during the four-day visit. Though she has declared that her tour is “religious” in nature, it is being seen here as a strategy to assert her dominance in the BJP. This is the third occasion of Ms. Raje going on a show of strength this year in the shape of a religious or personal visit. Upset on being sidelined within the party, Ms. Raje went on a two-day “pilgrimage” to the Lord Krishna Circuit in Bharatpur in March and made a high-profile visit to Jodhpur in October to offer condolences to Union Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat on his mother’s death and to the family of the departed Congress leader Mahipal Maderna. Tumultuous welcome On Wednesday, she arrived in Udaipur to a tumultuous welcome by the party workers and leaders opposed to Mewar region’s seniormost leader Gulab Chand Kataria, including former Speaker Shantilal Chaplot and former Vallabhnagar MLA Randhir Singh Bhindar, who fought the recent bypolls as a rebel. Ms. Raje inaugurated a “Suhani Sardi” (pleasant winter) campaign of a voluntary group in the city. The BJP leadership is yet to come to terms with the rout faced in the byelections at Udaipur division’s Dhariawad and Vallabhnagar seats, where its candidates were relegated to third and fourth positions, respectively. The party had announced her as one of the star campaigners in the bypolls, but she did not join the campaign.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vasundhara-trip-creates-a-desert-storm-for-bjp/article37675566.ece
25 November 2021||New Delhi,||Centre raises concern over fall in COVID-19 testing rates||The Union Health Ministry on Wednesday expressed concern over declining weekly COVID-19 testing rates in Nagaland, Sikkim, Maharashtra, Kerala, Goa, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan, West Bengal and Ladakh, and directed the 13 States and Union Territories to rectify the “worrying trend”. This Ministry, in a letter, noted that in the absence of sustained levels of sufficient testing, it was difficult to determine the true extent of the spread of the infection. With many countries witnessing surges in COVID-19 cases despite high levels of vaccination, there was a need for continued vigil, given the unpredictable and contagious nature of the disease, it said. “Hence, all efforts must be implemented to preserve the gains made so far and to prevent deterioration of COVID scenario across the country,” the letter said. According to data released by the Ministry, Nagaland reported 342 average daily tests in the week ending November 22. This is in stark contrast to the 1,250 average daily tests conducted in the period August 23-29. The Ministry further said that worrying trends with regards to tests, tests per million, positivity rate and higher dependence on rapid antigen tests had been observed in various districts of the State.  “Also, with the onset of winter and increased pollution in some States, prevalence of ILI/SARI and respiratory distress symptoms should be closely monitored, with tests conducted regularly for timely monitoring and clustering of cases for early hotspot identification,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-raises-concern-over-fall-in-covid-19-testing-rates/article37675596.ece
25 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC reimposes Delhi construction ban||The credit for loosening the smog’s choke on Delhi in the past few days largely goes to the wind, an “‘act of God”, but the wind may die by the end of the day to leave the Capital again at the mercy of pollution, Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana told the Government on Wednesday. “We are saved because of the wind,” the Chief Justice Ramana addressed Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta, for the Centre. “It is what we call in law an ‘act of God,’” Justice D.Y. Chandrachud noted. The Solicitor-General said the ban on construction and demolition activities had not been extended in the Capital. But the ban would be re-imposed if the situation worsened, he said. The court reimposed the ban in Delhi-NCR as an interim measure. The court nevertheless allowed non-polluting activities related to construction like plumbing and interior decoration to continue. The Bench directed that funds collected as labour cess for the welfare of construction workers should be paid for their subsistence. “I think there is no substantial change. It appears to be getting serious again.. You will have to take measures for another three days,” the Chief Justice told the Government. The court clarified it had no intention to dispose of the case or stop monitoring the pollution graph. If necessary, it would hear the case “almost every day”, the Bench underscored. Justice Chandrachud criticised how the Government waited for pollution to take a turn for the worse before scurrying to kick in pollution control measures. The court urged the Government to continue with anti-pollution measures for another three days. It listed the case on Monday.

Imagine the message you are sending across the globe… You take measures after waiting for the weather to become ‘severe plus’ or ‘emergency’. You should have a graded response ready and take measures in anticipation of the weather based on wind patterns.... Why should Delhiites suffer pollution that goes from ‘very poor’ to ‘emergency’?” Justice Chandrachud asked Mr. Mehta. The court urged the Government to continue with anti-pollution measures for another three days.

25 November 2021||New Delhi,||Local militants feeling the heat in Valley||More than 80% of the militants killed this year in Kashmir hailed from the Valley, according to Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) data. The CRPF is one of the largest Central forces deployed in the Valley for counter-terrorism operations, along with the Jammu and Kashmir Police and the Army. According to a CRPF official, till November 23, as many as 148 militants had been killed, of which 127 were residents and 21 foreigners. In 2020, the number of militants killed in the Valley stood at 195. 199 militants active The official said 199 militants were active in the Valley. “Out of the active militants, 110 are locals and 89 are foreigners,” he added. Another official added that of the active militants, 97 were recruited to the fold of various terror groups such as The Resistance Front (TRF) this year. The police say the TRF, which has claimed responsibility for the recent civilian killings in the Valley, is a front for the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). As many as 178 men joined the militants ranks in 2020, of which 121 were killed. The number of such recruitment in 2019 was 117. J&K has been under Central rule since June 2018. In August 2019, Parliament abrogated the special status given to J&K under Article 370 of the Constitution and bifurcated the former State into the Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh. The CRPF has deployed around 65,000 personnel in J&K. The force has also enhanced the compensation to the next of kin of personnel killed in action. “The amount for those killed in action has been increased from Rs. 21.5 lakh to Rs. 35 lakh and for those who died of other reasons, it has been enhanced from Rs. 16.5 lakh to Rs. 25 lakh,” the official said. This compensation is provided from the risk fund and central welfare fund of the CRPF. While all CRPF personnel contribute Rs. 500 each to the risk fund, the contribution to the central welfare fund depends on the rank of the official. CRPF has a strength of around 3 lakh personnel. This year, 11 CRPF personnel have been killed in action — three in J&K and eight in areas affected by Left Wing Extremism.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/local-militants-feeling-the-heat-in-valley/article37675699.ece
25 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Normal international flights very soon: Govt.||International flights are likely to be normalised before 2021-end, Rajiv Bansal, Secretary, Civil Aviation Ministry, said on Wednesday. India banned scheduled international flights from March 22, 2020. Over the past 18 months, however, it has entered into “air bubble” arrangements with 31 countries under which a limited number of flights are permitted with several restrictions. Scheduled international flights are likely to resume “very soon” and “by the end of this year”, Mr. Bansal told reporters. Several airlines, embassies, tour operators and travel agents have appealed to the Government to allow pre-COVID capacity as restrictions on the number of flights under “air bubbles” have led to fares soaring. For example, as per the agreement with Dubai, its airlines Emirates and flydubai are allowed only 4,800 seats per day, or 33,600 seats per week, whereas they were allowed 65,200 flights per week before the pandemic under the bilateral air service agreement. As a result, airlines say, the capacity has come down to half on the India-Dubai route leading to doubling of fares to Rs. 40,000-Rs. 45,000. As different Ministries sit down to chalk out a strategy to reopen flights, the key focus will be on ensuring safety of health. “I am all for regaining our space in the civil aviation arena and making a hub in India and for more wide-bodied aircraft. We will get there but bear with me and trust me, I am on your side. We will work together but in a safe environment,” Mr. Bansal said.

25 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||UAE seeks exemption from air bubble||Faced with a rush on flights to the Dubai Expo 2021 during the winter tourist season, the United Arab Emirates has asked India to reconsider its restricted “air travel bubble” arrangement started during the pandemic, and to make a special exception for it during the expo that runs until March 31, Ambassador Ahmed Al-Banna said here on Wednesday. “If you try and book a flight from any airport in India to the UAE — Dubai, Abu Dhabi or Sharjah — it is close to impossible to find a seat easily. We are working on that and we hope to finalise something with the Indian authorities,” Mr. Al-Banna told reporters during a briefing on the expo which falls within the UAE’s “Golden Jubilee” year. “We have asked the Government to exempt us from those restrictions during the expo but are yet to receive any green light.” He said at present the UAE national carriers — Emirates and Etihad — were travelling at only 30% of their capacity, and the number of passengers travelling “would double” if India lifted the “bubble” restrictions. This would also help those trying to visit the expo that began on October 1, which, officials said, received about 41 lakh visits, including about 3.9 lakh visits to the India Pavillion. Flight capacity The problem over flight capacity is also likely to figure in the bilateral conversations as External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar is expected to travel to Abu Dhabi next week to address the “Indian Ocean Region” Conference on December 4-6. This will be Mr. Jaishankar’s second visit in as many months, after he visited the expo and met the UAE leadership on November 13-14. Speaking about the newly launched India-Israel-UAE-U.S. quadrilateral at the time, Mr. Jaishankar said there would be an in-person ministerial meeting of what is being called the “West Asian Quad” in the next few weeks. To questions on the new Quad, Mr. Al-Banna said the “Quadrant” is not a strategic collaboration. “We have emphasised that the Quadrant is an economic arrangement between the four countries. I read articles that said this was about … creating a second NATO ... that doesn’t make any sense. This will concentrate on business and economic collaborations.” He said preparations were under way on teams that would work on the various issues identified for cooperation, to be followed by a ministerial meeting. Mr. Al-Banna also said he hoped that the India-UAE negotiations on a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) would be concluded in the next few months, possibly even before March 2022, which would give a fillip to bilateral trade, investment and travel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/uae-seeks-exemption-from-air-bubble/article37675587.ece
25 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||SIT defends investigation into 2002 Godhra riots cases||The Special Investigation Team (SIT) on Wednesday in the Supreme Court defended its investigation into the Godhra riots cases of 2002. Appearing before a Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said the SIT, which was appointed by the apex court, did a “thorough” job in probing the riots. Mr. Rohatgi said the allegations of a “larger conspiracy” behind the riots was baseless. The role of every accused was looked into by the SIT. Accusations of “collaboration” by it were reckless, Mr. Rohatgi submitted. “There is no material to conclude that there was any other conspiracy than the cases that are being tried,” the senior advocate argued. He said several cases had been re-opened and investigated again. Chargesheets were filed. The senior lawyer said no FIR had been registered on the basis of Ms. Jafri’s complaint of a larger conspiracy. In an earlier hearing, the apex court had observed that its September 12, 2011 order, had merely directed the SIT to “look into” the material brought forth by Ms. Jafri and file a final report before the magistrate court concerned in Gujarat. Following the apex court order in 2011, the SIT had gone on to file a closure report in February 2012.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sit-defends-investigation-into-2002-godhra-riots-cases/article37675648.ece
25 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Railways to resume cooked food service on premium trains||With things gradually returning to pre-pandemic normalcy, the Indian Railways has decided to restore catering services with cooked food on premium trains such as Rajdhani, Shatabdi, Duronto, Vande Bharat, Tejas and Gatiman.  As per the order issued by the Railway Board on December 23, the Zonal Railways will verify the catering charges to be realised based on services being provided and the applicable rate list and feed the same in the PRS software for enabling booking/opting out of catering services, from advanced reservation period (ARP) date, at the time of booking of tickets. For PNRs already booked, the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) will intimate the Zonal Railway concerned about the exact date from which onboard catering services with cooked food will be resumed on a particular train for the journeys falling within the ARP. The order added that the Zonal Railways on getting such intimation will enable the option of booking meal/opting out of catering services for the journey dates starting from the commencement of catering service in PRS software. The Board also directed the IRCTC to inform e-ticket passengers already booked on above-mentioned trains through SMS and e-mail regarding resumption of cooked food supply.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/railways-to-resume-cooked-food-service-on-premium-trains/article37675582.ece
25 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Bangladesh pact example of mutual respect’||The historic land boundary agreement between India and Bangladesh has set a unique example on resolving border disputes through mutual negotiations at a time when “certain” countries are trying to alter the status quo by force, said Army chief General Manoj Naravane on Wednesday without naming anyone. His comments come in the backdrop of continuing negotiations between India and China for disengagement and de-escalation towards ending the ongoing stand-off in eastern Ladakh. Speaking at a seminar on ‘India-Bangladesh: 50 years of friendship’ organised by the Centre for Land Warfare Studies, Bangladesh High Commissioner Muhammad Imran noted that water sharing was an “emotive issue” in Bangladesh and called for attention on resolving the outstanding issues. “The historic land boundary agreement between our nations has set a unique example on how to resolve border disputes through mutual negotiations and a concerted outlook. This at a time when certain countries are trying to alter the status quo by force, bypassing traditional norms and protocols and with complete disregard to the territorial integrity of others,” Gen. Naravane said. “Such agreements as that between ours epitomises the three ‘Ms’ — Mutual respect, [mutual] trust and [mutual] commitment to the rules-based order.” India and Bangladesh have resolved both the land and maritime boundary issues by mutual agreement. This year marks the diamond jubilee of the 1971 war and also 50 years of the establishment of diplomatic ties between India and Bangladesh. Observing that there were issues in the bilateral relationship in the past, Mr. Imran said that under the present Government of Sheikh Hasina the relationship between the countries had made progress.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bangladesh-pact-example-of-mutual-respect/article37675542.ece
25 November 2021||New Delhi,||12 Congress MLAs join Trinamool in Meghalaya||Senior Congress leader and Leader of the Opposition in the Meghalaya Assembly, Mukul Sangma, along with 11 other Congress legislators are said to have joined the All India Trinamool Congress late on Wednesday evening. There was, however, no formal announcement by the MLAs as they are likely to hold a press conference in Meghalaya’s capital Shillong on Thursday. Trinamool Congress sources, however, confirmed the development. Mr. Sangma, along with his colleagues, submitted a joint letter to Speaker Metbah Lyngdoh, a source confirmed to The Hindu . Principal Opposition With this development, the Trinamool Congress will be the principal Opposition party in the Meghalaya Legislative Assembly even though it had not won any seat in the 2018 Assembly election in the State. The Congress that so far had 17 legislators will now be reduced to only five MLAs. Among those who are said to have joined the Trinamool, eight MLAs, including former Chief Minister Mr. Sangma, are from the Garo Hills, while the remaining four legislators are from the Khasi Jaintia Hills. Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi had met Mr. Sangma and State Congress chief Vincent Pala in the first week of October in Delhi to resolve their differences. But the meeting clearly failed to prevent the former Chief Minister from switching over to the Trinamool. In the 60-member Meghalaya Assembly, the National People’s Party (NPP)-led coalition is in government. The NPP is a part of the National Democratic Alliance in the Centre as well as an ally of the BJP in Manipur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/12-congress-mlas-join-trinamool-in-meghalaya/article37675652.ece
25 November 2021||GUWAHATI,||Tension brewing on Assam-Arunachal border||Assam has moved closer to resolving its decades-old boundary dispute with Meghalaya, but tension has been brewing on its Arunachal Pradesh frontier. Miscreants allegedly fired at Assam forest officials on November 23 in the Ronga Reserve Forest of the State’s Lakhimpur district. The spot is near the Arunachal Pradesh border. On November 20, a team of Assam forest officials was detained by allegedly illegal settlers from Arunachal Pradesh in the forest. They were later rescued by the Assam police. The Lakhimpur district police officials said a joint operation was on with their Arunachal Pradesh counterparts to apprehend the miscreants. The firing coincided with the visit of the members of the border committees of Assam and Meghalaya to various areas of difference along the inter-State boundary. These areas included Hawla, Lyngkhung, Jimbrigaon, Boklapara and Patgaon villages on the border of Ri-Bhoi (Meghalaya) and Kamrup (Assam) districts. Things have not been quiet on Assam’s border with Mizoram too. Forest officials in southern Assam’s Hailakandi district have flagged a 3.5-km road being built by Mizoram inside a reserve forest in Assam despite the Centre’s advisory against construction in disputed areas along the inter-State boundary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tension-brewing-on-assam-arunachal-border/article37675580.ece
25 November 2021||November 25 2021 00:00 IST,||More hospital births, indicates NFHS-5||“This is a significant feat for the country’s family-planning programme, which does not include coercive policies. These findings bust the population-explosion myth and show that India must steer away from coercive measures of population control. While the increase in the use of modern contraceptive methods is heartening, an increase in female sterilisation coupled with continued stagnation in male sterilisation uptake shows that the onus of family planning still lies with women,” the Population Foundation of India, a non-governmental organisation, said in a statement. An overall survey of the major differences between the NFHS-5 and NFHS-4 suggests that the use of contraceptives has improved from 53.5% to 66.7% and institutional births increased from 78.9% to 88.6%. The proportion of children (12-23 months) who were fully vaccinated improved from 62%-76% and children under six months who were exclusively breastfed also showed a sharp improvement from 54.9% to 63.7%. Though the gains in childhood nutrition were minimal, women and men (15-49) who had a below normal body mass index (BMI) each dropped roughly four percentage points. Those overweight (or had a higher BMI than ideal) increased by around 4 percentage points. Abnormal BMIs are linked to an increase in obesity and other non-communicable diseases. India's battle with anaemia also appears to have faltered. The proportion of anaemic children (6-59 months) increased from 58% to 67%. Women aged 15-49 who were anaemic increased from 53% to 57% and men of the same age increased from 29% to 31% between both editions of the NFHS.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/more-hospital-births-indicates-nfhs-5/article37675534.ece
25 November 2021||November 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Will you ban convicts from polls, SC asks Govt.||“They are bound by their oath to serve citizens and country... They are bound by propriety, good conscience and interest of the nation,” the Ministry had argued. The Centre had attempted to buttress its case last year by citing a Constitution Bench decision in the Public Interest Foundation case of 2019 which said “though criminalisation of politics is a bitter manifest truth, which is a termite to the citadel of democracy, be that as it may, the court cannot make the law”. In a separate case, the apex court said States have a large number of criminal cases pending against former and sitting legislators, and poll-bound Uttar Pradesh may host the “largest”. The Government had maintained that disqualification under the Representation of the People Act of 1951 for the period of prison sentence and six years thereafter was enough for legislators. The petitioner, advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay, urged the need for a level playing field. He said if a convicted person cannot be a government clerk, the same rule should apply to a politician.“A person who cannot be a government clerk, can be a Minister,” Mr. Upadhyay submitted. Meanwhile, in a separate case, the court said States across the country have a large number of criminal cases pending against former and sitting legislators, and poll-bound Uttar Pradesh may host the “largest”. “Are these Special Courts constituted for this purpose [the trial of criminal cases against former and sitting MPs/MLAs] exclusively?” the CJI asked the lawyer. Justice Surya Kant, on the Special Bench, said the total pendency of such cases in the State was 1,374. “You have not established a single court exclusively for this purpose,” he said. Justice Kant said existing courts have been “labelled” Special Courts Justice D.Y. Chandrachud referred to a December 4, 2018 order which had requested each High Court to “assign/allocate criminal cases involving former and sitting legislators to as many Sessions Courts and Magisterial Courts as each High Court may consider proper, fit and expedient”. However, according to a report submitted by senior advocate Vijay Hansaria and advocate Sneha Kalita, the Allahabad High Court had constituted only Special Courts at the level of the Sessions Judge for trial of criminal cases against legislators. The court contemplated that the way forward may be to request the High Courts, which have not constituted Special Magisterial Courts, to establish them. The case on trial at the Special Sessions Courts would be transferred to these new Magisterial Courts. The trial of these cases would resume from the point of transfer. Additional Solicitor General S.V. Raju, for the Centre, objected, saying the transfer of the records of these cases would take time and further delay the trial.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/will-you-ban-convicts-from-polls-sc-asks-govt/article37675535.ece

In this context, he referred to some of the HADR missions in the IOR undertaken by India in recent years, including Operation Rahat in Yemen in 2015, cyclone in Sri Lanka in 2016; quake in Indonesia in 2019; Cyclone Idai in Mozambique and flooding and landslips in Madagascar in January 2020. Challenging landscape Stating that we live in a challenging geo-political landscape where countries have to face, traditional and non-traditional threats including natural calamities which include pandemics like COVID-19, which has wreaked havoc in the last two years, Mr. Singh said, “We must look at cooperating more closely to strengthen international architecture for building structures to prevent and manage future disasters.” He said benefits of cutting-edge technologies emerging in the fields of space, communication, bio-engineering, bio-medics and Artificial Intelligence should be shared with all.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-first-responder-in-indian-ocean-region/article37675543.ece

25 November 2021||Mumbai,||‘Claims against former Minister only hearsay’||Former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh told a judicial commission that the allegations of corruption he made against former Home Minister of Maharashtra Anil Deshmukh were based on “hearsay”. Advocate Abhinav Chandrachud, on behalf of Mr. Singh, told a one-member committee of retired Justice K.U. Chandiwal that Mr. Singh did not have anything further to share in the matter. Mr. Singh, who has been granted protection from arrest by the Supreme Court after a lower court declared him a “proclaimed offender”, on Wednesday said he was in Chandigarh and would visit Mumbai soon. Mr. Chandrachud on Tuesday said he would file an affidavit in a week and “it will say nothing more than what has already been said, which is that the information given to Mr. Singh was provided by some officers”. “He [Mr. Singh] has no first-hand information of what transpired,” the lawyer said. He added that the information provided by Mr Singh, in that sense, was hearsay. “Even if he were to step into the witness box it would have no value in law because it would be what someone else told him. Therefore, he has nothing to depose.” Two bailable warrants have been issued against Mr. Singh by the Chandiwal Commission. The commission was appointed on March 30 by the Maharashtra Government to inquire into the allegations made by Mr. Singh in a letter he wrote to the Chief Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/claims-against-former-minister-only-hearsay/article37675548.ece

Following a year of protests by farmers against the three agriculture laws, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement on November 19 that these would be repealed led to renewed calls from trade unions for repeal of the labour codes too. Amarjeet Kaur, general secretary of the All-India Trade Union Congress, said the joint platform of 10 Central trade unions would meet on Thursday and then meet the leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha to plan their course of action. “We will intensify our protests to demand the repeal of the labour codes. The Government is only looking at elections,” Ms. Kaur said. The RSS-affiliated Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh was also not optimistic about the implementation of the codes soon.

Earlier this month, Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey had told presspersons that there was no proposal for extension as the economy was reviving. “In the last more than 20 months, we have seen that the poor, even the middle class families have suffered, not here but globally as well. One of the ways to help the poor families was to give them foodgrains,” Mr. Thakur said. “We still feel as the economy is getting back on track, the figures are looking much better. At the same time, Prime Minister wants to help those poor families who have gone through this COVID-19 pandemic, so that for the next four months, they should be helped and foodgrains should be given to them,” he added. In the run-up to the Uttar Pradesh Assembly election, the State Government had announced a unilateral extension of the PMGKAY until March 2022. Several other State Governments and political parties demanded an extension by the Centre, although Food Ministry officials said no direct request had been received, and Mr. Pandey insisted that the decision had not been taken with U.P. alone in mind.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centres-free-foodgrain-scheme-on-till-march/article37675560.ece
25 November 2021||November 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Bhakti in Kali Yuga||In the depiction of Krishna avatar in the Bhagavata Purana, many people get the chance to move with Him closely and experience His presence. They are attracted to Him and express their devotion in their individual ways. Among them Uddhava, a kinsman and great devotee of Krishna, is described as one who is also most dear to the Lord. At the end of His avatar, when Krishna has to depart, Uddhava is unable to bear the thought of being separated from Him and voices his many concerns to the Lord, pointed out Sri Dushyanth Sridhar in a discourse. The Supreme Lord, the embodiment of Sat-chit-ananda, is beyond form and name; yet He came down to earth in human form for the sake of His devotees. Now, without Krishna’s protection what would be the fate of people in Kali Yuga when cruelty is sure to hold full sway, asks Uddhava. Krishna should not leave the earth, for even good people shall feel the adverse influences of Kali Yuga. In the Bhagavata Mahatmya, it is held that the Lord started to think deeply on what Uddhava said and then decided to assimilate all His powers and essence into the text Bhagavata Purana. Krishna tells Uddhava that one who has intense love for Him and constantly remembers Him with love and devotion is sure to get liberated from samsara. He can attain whatever he wants. Bhakti helps to initiate the thoughts of the Lord in people and by listening to the purana or by reading it one gradually begins to feel the presence of the Lord in the text. The purana gives mental strength to people in Kali Yuga to overcome the power of Maya that distorts one’s understanding of Truth. It removes the sins of people and helps them to win over the passions of lust and anger.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bhakti-in-kali-yuga/article37675577.ece
25 November 2021||New Delhi,||3 lakh COVID victims in Gujarat: Rahul||Ahead of the 2022 Assembly election in Gujarat, the Congress on Wednesday launched a campaign that challenges the “Gujarat Model” and alleged that three lakh people died of COVID-19 in the State. He demanded Rs. 4 lakh as compensation for the kin of the victims. Termed the “Congress Nyay Campaign”, the short video has former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi assuring people that his party will make sure that the Government pays Rs. 4 lakh as compensation to the kin of the victims. Mr. Gandhi also urged people to register themselves onwww.4lakhdenahoga.com. He said right now the Government was paying only Rs. 50,000 to the victims and the Gujarat Government had acknowledged only 10,000 deaths. Two demands “The Congress party has two demands. The correct figure of deaths should be given and Rs. 4 lakh compensation should be given to the families. The Government will have to ease the pain of the people and they should get compensation,” he tweeted along with the campaign video. The video also has testimonials by the families of the victims talking about lack of testing facilities, shortage of hospital beds, oxygen and ventilators. “There is always a lot of discussion about the Gujarat model. All the families we spoke to said they didn’t find a hospital bed, ventilator or oxygen,” Mr. Gandhi said in the video. The clip showed a member of a Patel family from Valsad saying, “My brother would have been alive if he had got a ventilator.” “They say Ahmedabad is a mega-city but we had to go to Anand for a hospital bed,” the video quoted a woman from the Qadri family. An elderly man from Himmatnagar’s Prajapati family breaks down while talking about his son dying while being treated inside a vehicle. “When you had to help them in the hospital, you were not there and when they lost Rs. 10-15 lakh in hospital and also their family members, you were still not there to provide compensation. What type of Government is this,” Mr. Gandhi asked. He alleged that while the Narendra Modi Government could not pay the compensation, it waived off lakhs of crores in tax relief to business tycoons and bought aircraft worth Rs. 8,500 crore to fly the Prime Minister. “The Congress party will exert pressure on the Government and will make sure compensation of Rs. 4 lakh each is paid,” Mr. Gandhi said. Though the BJP had changed almost the entire Cabinet including former Chief Minister Vijay Rupani in September over its handling of the pandemic, the video makes it clear that the party would make it a major poll issue for the Assembly elections towards 2022-end.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/3-lakh-covid-victims-in-gujarat-says-rahul/article37675570.ece

25 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||T.N. ahead in reproductive, child health||With significant improvements in several social and health parameters, when compared with the previous edition, the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 5 seems to have set the State on its regular path ahead yet again, particularly in reproductive and child health. While the drastic reduction in vaccination rates during NFHS 4 was disconcerting for a State that is usually ahead of the national averages, particularly in the health sector, it is of some solace that the vaccination rates are climbing back up. From lower down the scale at 69.7% during the 2015-16 assessment, the percentage of fully vaccinated children in the 12-23 months age group has risen to 89.2% in the current assessment (2019-2021). “The comeback in vaccination after the disastrous District Level Health Survey and the earlier NFHS 4 is rather remarkable. We retraced our steps with targeted interventions in districts that had parameters lower than the national average. Our village health nurses and ANMs should be given credit for this,” said Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan. The hard work of field-level staff is also evident in the improving figures of maternal care — the percentage of mothers who had an antenatal check up in the first trimester went up to 77.4 (from 64), and the percentage of mothers who had at least 4 antenatal visits climbed to 89.9 (from 81.1). The percentage of mothers who were protected by tetanus, those who had taken iron and frolic acid when they were pregnant, also went up significantly in NFHS 5. There were marginal increases in the percentage of institutional births — a nearly 99.8% of births were attended to by skilled health personnel. However, the percentage of caesarian section births has gone up both in private and public health care facilities, with the total percentage of C-section births at 44.9 (up from 34.1) in the State. Other studies too have independently shown a rising trend in C-section deliveries in Tamil Nadu. The neo-natal mortality rate has gone down to 12.7 (deaths per 1,000 live births in the first 28 days after birth), from 14 in NFHS 4. The infant mortality rate has further dropped to 18.6 from 20.2, and the under-5 mortality rate now stands at 22.3 — a drop from 26.8 in NFHS 4. While sex ratio at birth of the total population is encouraging, at 1,088 females per 1,000 males (up from 1,033 in NFHS 4), the sex ratio at birth for children born in the last five years is worrisome, at 867 (a drop from 954 in NFHS 4). NFHS 5 fieldwork was done from January 6, 2020, to March 21, 2020, before the lockdown, and again from December 21, 2020, to March 31, 2021. Information was gathered from 27,929 households, 25,650 women and 3,372 men.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-ahead-in-reproductive-child-health/article37675767.ece

Sekarbabu on Wednesday said the renovation of the Mandaikadu Bhagavathi Amman temple in Kanniyakumari was being carried out as per devaprasannam recommendations. Mr. Sekarbabu, who inaugurated the renovation works in the temple where there was a fire accident recently, said those protesting over the renovation should understand that the government was particular about completing the work within the stipulated time. “If they had come to us instead of organising protests, we would have allowed them to sit with us to air their views. All works are being done as per devaprsannam recommendations and there is no political interference,” he told reporters when asked about the protests organised by some Hindu outfits. Fire damage He said the roof of the sanctum sanctorum of the temple was damaged in a fire that broke out in June and the government is restoring it to its original shape. The cost of the work is Rs. 95 lakh. The wood works at the sanctum sanctorum would be renovated at a cost of Rs. 5.50 lakh. Mr. Sekarbabu said works were awarded through proper tender procedures and the overall cost for renovation work was estimated to be Rs. 1.10 crore. He also visited the Thanumalayaswamy Temple in Suchindram where water entered during the recent floods. He promised to look into the demand of the temple employees for a hike in salary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/temple-renovation-will-be-completed-on-time/article37675807.ece

25 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Moderate to heavy rain in State likely||Chennai may have to brace for another downpour, as rainfall may steadily increase from Thursday. The city may begin to experience moderate rainfall from Thursday, and the intensity may peak to very heavy rain on November 27 and 28. Fairly widespread rainfall may cover the State till Thursday and it may become widespread from Friday, once a low pressure area forms over the southwest Bay of Bengal by Thursday. In most parts of State An India Meteorological Department (IMD) bulletin issued at 12.30 p.m. said this weather system is likely to move west-northwestwards towards Sri Lanka and the south Tamil Nadu coast. A trough that runs from the weather system to south Tamil Nadu in the lower tropospheric level will also ensure that rainfall covers most parts of the State. Officials of the Meteorological department said two districts — Ramanathapuram, and Pudukottai — may experience heavy to very heavy rain on Thursday. Delta districts and five other districts, including Kanniyakumari, Cuddalore, and Puducherry and Karaikal may receive heavy rainfall. Many places over coastal and south Tamil Nadu may begin to receive moderate rain. Slow moving system S. Balachandran, Deputy Director General of Meteorology, Chennai said heavy rain may start from south Tamil Nadu on Wednesday and cover north coastal and adjoining interior districts. This rain spell may last till the month-end. This is a slow moving system and it is taking time to intensify. It may cover a large area with rainfall of varied intensity, he said. As the system is at a low latitude, the chances for it to intensify are also low. Moreover, wind speed may decrease as it moves towards Sri Lanka. During the past 24 hours ending 8.30 a.m. on Wednesday, Bodinaickanur in Theni district and Ramanathapuram recorded 13cm of rainfall, the highest in the State for the day. On November 26 too, very heavy rainfall may occur in isolated places in delta districts, Cuddalore, Ramanathapuram, Thoothukudi and Karaikal. Chennai and its neighbouring districts and Puducherry may begin to get heavy rain from Friday. ‘No fishing’ From Saturday, north coastal and adjoining interior districts, including Chennai and Cuddalore, may receive heavy to very heavy rainfall in isolated places. The Department has also warned fishermen not to venture into the sea as squally winds with speed gusting up to 50 km may prevail over Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh coasts till November 28.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/city-may-have-to-brace-for-another-downpour/article37675772.ece

25 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK meet sees exchange of views||The meeting of senior office-bearers and district secretaries of the AIADMK on Wednesday saw an intense exchange of views on several issues, including the impact of the 10.5% quota for the Vanniyars on the party’s performance in the last Assembly election and the efficacy of the steering committee. Though the meeting was convened to discuss the party’s preparedness for the urban local bodies elections and the organisational elections, it discussed other issues. The camps of coordinator O. Panneerselvam and co-coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami were also engaged in placing their arguments and counter-arguments. The trouble began when A. Anwhar Raajhaa, minorities wing secretary and former Ramanathapuram MP, rose to make his point on the strategy to be adopted for the local bodies elections. Some members, including G. Hari, former Arakkonam MP, and C.Ve. Shanmugam, former Law Minister, protested against Mr. Raajhaa for having made “derogatory” remarks against Mr. Palaniswami. P. Venugopal, former Tiruvallur MP, went to the defence of Mr. Raajhaa, who expressed regret for his observations and wanted the party to go it alone in the urban local bodies elections. K.A. Sengottaiyan, former School Education Minister, said the services of senior leaders should be utilised better. Paul Manoj Pandian, Alangulam MLA, stressed the need for providing adequate space to different communities within the party. However, the meeting, which lasted four-and-a-half hours, also witnessed Mr. Panneerselvam and Mr. Palaniswami articulating their divergent views on the 10.5% quota and the steering committee. The coordinator suggested that the steering committee’s size be increased to take in some of the senior members. He wanted the committee to be given a critical role in decision-making. But Mr. Palaniswami expressed reservations about the idea of the panel being given such a role, when he and Mr. Panneerselvam themselves could not effectively address several issues. When Mr. Panneerselvam said the quota was one of the factors that led to the party’s defeat in the southern districts, the co-coordinator said the decision was “a collective one”. Briefing reporters on the discussions, D. Jayakumar, organisation secretary, said the exchange of views took place in a “healthy way” and in a “democratic manner”. While the meeting was in progress, a section of party members of a panchayat union in Chengalpattu district staged a demonstration in the party headquarters, demanding that the local office-bearers be changed. They dispersed after party representatives pacified them. Mr. Sengottaiyan wanted transparency in the decision-making process and felt that the size of the steering committee could be increased. A proposal was mooted to increase the number of members from 11 to 18. Clarifying his public remarks on the question of admitting former interim general secretary V. K. Sasikala back into the party, Mr. Panneerselvam explained that he did not favour or oppose any course of action. His remarks had only underscored the importance of all the senior functionaries to be involved in decision-making. As for the 10.5% quota, the coordinator recalled that it was he who had moved the Bill in the Assembly. But his point was that all other communities should be taken into confidence. A release said the party’s executive would meet on December 1.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-meet-sees-intense-exchange-of-views/article37675797.ece
25 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Ban on registering properties on waterbodies to be enforced||To strictly enforce the existing ban on the registration of properties on waterbodies, waterways and water catchment areas, the Registration Department has warned Sub-Registrars of disciplinary action if they violate the norm. After a review meeting convened by Chief Secretary V. Irai Anbu in the wake of the Madras High Court’s direction to the State Government to evict encroachments on the Chitlapakkam and Selaiyur tanks and its inflow/outflow waterways in Chengalpattu district, the Registration Department has said that no more registrations should be permitted on waterbodies, waterways, water catchment areas and associated Government poromboke lands, under any circumstance. In the event of any deviation from the norm, responsibility will be fixed on the Deputy Inspector General of Registration, District Registrar and Sub-Registrar concerned, and disciplinary action will be initiated under provisions of the Tamil Nadu Civil Services (Disciplinary & Appeal) Rules, 1973. Besides, the concerned officials will also have to face contempt of court proceedings, the Additional Inspector General of Registrations said in an order issued on Tuesday. Zero value District Registrars were told to coordinate with the Revenue Department and access their land records software to compile details of all waterbodies, waterways and water catchment areas across Tamil Nadu and fix the value of the land as “zero”, so that there would be no more transactions on the respective survey numbers. The Madras High Court order in September this year arose out of a petition filed by Arappor Iyakkam, an anti-corruption movement, that the tanks and their inflow-outflow channels were encroached upon and buildings constructed on them, in Chitlapakkam and Selaiyur areas. This was not only lowering the water table but also causing flooding, resulting in loss of life and property. The latest order of the Registration Department will mean that there will be no more registration of any property built on any survey number, earmarked as waterbodies on revenue records, said a senior functionary of the Tamil Nadu Registration Department Officials’ Association. “Even if the unapproved buildings are regularised by the respective local bodies, the construction remains unlawful, and its value will be reduced to ‘zero’. There are a number of such houses, flats and other buildings constructed on waterbodies across the State...,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ban-on-registering-properties-on-waterbodies-to-be-enforced/article37675768.ece
25 November 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||After a decade, Radha Nagar subway work to be taken up||The work on Radha Nagar subway, pending for completion due to the approach road work, is set to be taken up shortly. The Southern Railway is set to give the permission to the State Highways department for starting the preliminary work for paving the approach road for the subway. The permission for the work has been pending with the Southern Railway. The subway has been a long-pending project for the residents of Chromepet as thousands of vehicles were getting caught in the traffic at the level crossing. The subway, built across the railway tracks, would help in providing easier and faster access for hundreds of residents to reach the GST Road. However, the subway work, which started more than a decade ago, has remained unfinished putting thousands of motorists to severe hardship, say residents’ welfare activists. The subway is being constructed by the State Highways department and is almost in the completion stage, except for the approach road linking the subway to the GST Road. Social activist V. Santhanam said the Radha Nagar subway project has been pending for more than a decade. He said that most of the construction work has been completed except for the ramps and the approach road. He also said that as per the reply from the State Highways department to a query through the Right To Information Act, the paving of the approach road was causing the project delay. He wanted the Southern Railway to give permission to the State Highways department. B. Guganesan, Chief Public Relations Officer, Southern Railway, said the General Arrangement Drawing (GAD) for the approach road has been approved and permission to carry out the work would be communicated shortly to the Highways department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/after-a-decade-radha-nagar-subway-work-to-be-taken-up/article37675777.ece
25 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Doctors implant device to treat boy with COVID-19 myocarditis||Doctors of Kauvery Hospital treated an 18-year-old boy, who suffered from COVID-19 myocarditis, with a device that helps in pumping out oxygenated blood, giving rest to the heart while maintaining blood flow to other organs in the body. Launching the “Impella Heart Recovery Programme”, R. Anantharaman, senior consultant, cardiologist, Kauvery Hospital, said that when a person suffered a cardiogenic shock due to heart attack or myocarditis, he/she is usually given medications to increase the heart rate and blood pressure. This, in turn, could affect the heart adversely and deteriorate its condition. The device, Impella, helped in pumping out oxygenated blood from the left ventricle of the heart into the aorta, thereby continuing to provide essential blood flow to sustain the function of the brain and other organs, a press release said. The boy with COVID-19 myocarditis, which is weakening of heart muscles due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, presented with cardiac arrest and was shifted to the cath lab where the Impella device was implanted through a catheter. Once the device was in place, the heart was given rest. The doctor said that his heart function improved from 15% to 50% on the fourth day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/doctors-implant-device-to-treat-boy-with-covid-19-myocarditis/article37675778.ece
25 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Brimming lakes filled with weeds, waste||Consistent rain this season has not only filled lakes in western parts of the city with water but also with weeds and waste from upstream. The Water Resources Department is removing truckloads of vegetation that has overgrown in lakes like Retteri. The chain of waterbodies in Ambattur, Korattur and Retteri have already reached their full capacity. However, these lakes are covered with a thick layer of water hyacinth after the intense rainspell early this month. An official of the WRD said: “Nearly 25 truck loads of weeds and waste were removed from Retteri lake alone over the past 10 days. We had already carried out the work as part of monsoon preparedness. But, loads of weeds had reached the lake from upstream through surplus courses and other drains.” The growth of weeds indicate sewage pollution in the waterbodies. Despite restoration efforts, Ambattur lake continues to be vulnerable to the disposal of untreated sewage from local bodies like Ayapakkam. Many of the neighbouring local bodies still lack proper underground sewer network and hence waterbodies turned a target for sewage discharge. Polluted water too got conveyed along with floodwater to the lakes downstream and led to the growth of weeds. Such menace can be put to an end only when the surrounding localities get a sewer network, officials said. The three lakes together have a storage capacity of 500 million cubic feet and surplus water from Retteri joins Red Hills reservoir’s surplus course. “We convey the waste and weeds removed from the lakes to Kodungaiyur dumpyard as of now,” the official added. The WRD continues to release 1,000 cusecs (cubic feet per second) of surplus water from Red Hills reservoir into the surplus course that joins the Ennore creek. Nearly 2,000 mcft of floodwater have been drained into the sea. Moreover, floodwater from Retteri too joins the channel. Though the course has a capacity to carry 7,000 cusecs, some of the low-level areas downstream get waterlogged when the course carries half its capacity. The stormwater drains are often connected at bed level instead of the channel’s maximum flood level. The SWD do not function during the rainy season as the channel is already flowing with floodwater and there is reverse flow from the SWD, waterlogging the nearby localities, officials added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/brimming-chennai-lakes-filled-with-weeds-and-waste/article37675775.ece
25 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Ownerless property is unknown to law: HC||An ownerless property is unknown to law. The moment the heartbeat of a person stops, the ownership of his/her estate gets transferred to the successor without any break, the Madras High Court said on Wednesday. It directed the Chennai Collector to hand over the keys of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s Poes Garden residence Veda Nilayam to her nephew J. Deepak and niece J. Deepa within three weeks. Justice N. Seshasayee made it clear that the Income Tax Department would be free to proceed to recover any tax arrears, payable by Jayalalithaa, which were chargeable on her estate as per law. After delivery of the verdict, Advocate-General R. Shunmugasundaram brought it to the notice of the court that a Bengaluru special court, which convicted Jayalalithaa in a disproportionate assets case, had ordered confiscation of a portion of Veda Nilayam. The Advocate-General said the special court’s verdict was confirmed by the Supreme Court and wanted to know whether the judge had made any reference to it in his judgment. Justice Seshasayee replied that he had confined his decision to the validity of the acquisition proceedings initiated by the government. All other issues would be left open to be decided in accordance with law. The judge rejected the question of maintainability raised by the previous AIADMK Government about the writ petitions filed by Mr. Deepak and Ms. Deepa on the ground that they were declared legal heirs by a Division Bench of the High Court only on May 27, 2020, whereas the acquisition proceedings were initiated much earlier. Pointing out that Jayalalithaa died intestate and Mr. Deepak and Ms. Deepa were her only legal heirs as per the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, the judge said the Division Bench had only declared their status legally on a particular date. Just because it took time to make such a declaration, it would not mean that the property was lying ownerless from the moment Jayalalithaa breathed her last till the declaration was made. “Where a property possesses an inherent character to outlive the death of the person who has held the right over it, then that right cannot exist in a vacuum. It is here that the law on inheritance or succession of rights comes in... They provide the rules to identify the person for vesting of ownership,” the judge said. He pointed out that if there were no legal heirs at all, the property would vest with the State. “The next point is about ascertaining the moment when ownership disappears in a dead person and re-appears in the successors-in-interest of the deceased. The answer is uncomplicated: It happens the moment the owner dies,” the judge added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ownerless-property-is-unknown-to-law-hc/article37675761.ece
25 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC refuses to interfere in inquiry against Isha Yoga Centre||The Madras High Court has refused to interfere with a suo motu inquiry initiated by the Tamil Nadu Commission for Protection of Child Rights in 2016, to find out whether there was any violation of child rights in the schools run by Isha Yoga Centre at Velliangiri in Coimbatore. The schools are run as per ‘gurukul’ form of education. Justice S.M. Subramaniam disposed of a writ petition filed by the Yoga Centre in 2016 and directed it to participate in the inquiry. He also directed the Commission to issue fresh summons for the administrator of the Yoga Centre to appear and tender an explanation. The inquiry was ordered to be completed in eight weeks. “The suo motu powers conferred on the Commission is to ensure that educational institutions function under recognised scheme of education pattern and in the event of any violation of rights of children, actions are imminent and therefore, mere issuance of summons would not provide cause for the petitioner to institute the present petition,” the judge wrote. He went on to state: “At the inquiry stage itself, the petitioner has approached the court which cannot be appreciated as they are expected to avail of the opportunities to be provided by the competent authorities for the purpose of establishing their case and to defend the allegations... It is needless to say the authorities are bound to conduct the inquiry in a free and fair manner.” The court was told that Isha Foundation was a trust founded by Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev on January 7, 1992.

Palaniswami on Wednesday demanded a reduction in the import duty on cotton, and a ban on the export of yarn and cotton. Making his suggestions in the light of a reported increase in the price of cotton yarn, he said in a statement that the State Government should hold talks with bodies representing textile manufacturers, handlooms, powerlooms, importers and exporters and resolve their problems. The Government should take stern action against those hoarding cotton and yarn; subsidise yarn; and impress upon the GST Council the need to remove the 5% tax on yarn and cotton.

With the district reporting sporadic cases of dengue, the Health Department and the local bodies have stepped up source reduction activities to prevent the breeding of aedes aegypti, the primary vector. “Cases are increasing compared to last year, even though we never had any outbreak so far,” said District Collector G.S. Sameeran. He added that the district administration was closely monitoring the situation. P. Aruna, Deputy Director of Health Services, said that the district did not witness any deaths due to dengue this year. Though there was no alarming spike in the number of cases, the Health Department was taking control measures to prevent a situation like an outbreak. Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH), the biggest tertiary level government hospital in the region, was getting dengue cases from Coimbatore and neighbouring districts. CMCH Dean A. Nirmala said that the hospital had two patients each from Tiruppur and Erode a few days ago and three others from Coimbatore. “We have not come across any serious case of dengue infection in the recent past,” she said. The hospital has a special ward for treating dengue patients in isolation. The blood bank at the hospital was maintaining adequate stocks of platelet, transfusion of which is required in high-risk patients.

25 November 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Farmers demand release of water through TMC branch canal||Farmers benefiting from four tanks near Karumathur are demanding desilting of an old branch canal of Tirumangalam Main Canal (TMC) to ensure early and adequate supply of water to the tanks. However, Public Works Department officials said water supply to the tanks had already started through TMC Extension Canal. The issue came up for a prolonged discussion at DISHA meeting held here on Tuesday, with the farmers not relenting and finding support from Minister for Registration and Commercial Taxes P. Moorthy. Executive Engineer (Periyar-Vaigai Basin Division) V. Sugumaran said water had been released for a tank for eight days and after supplying water to other tanks for ensuring equitable distribution, another round of release started on Wednesday. Former vice-chairperson of Chellampatti Panchayat union A. Jeyaraman said the farmers had toiled hard to desilt the supply canal for 1.5 km with their own resources to take water to Valayankulam tank. “The stone canal has been designed with 1.5 feet width and 1.5 feet depth, which is not matching the huge size of the tank that has a water spread area of 170 acres,” he said. The tank did not get adequate water in the last 13 year and when there was flood in the Vaigai, the farmers wanted to make the most of the situation. A farmer, M. Elangovan of Karumathur, said desilting of Branch Canal 1 from the TMC would cut short the distance of water travel and the four tanks – Kovilankulam, Andikulam, Karukkanji and Valayankulam – would get adequate water at the earliest. Usilampatti MLA Ayyappan visited the village on Wednesday and inspected the water flowing to Valayankulam tank. The farmers said if their tanks were filled up, it would help raise paddy crop in several villages downstream. Mr. Elangovan claimed that water was released directly to these tanks till 1982, but was diverted after the construction of the TMC Extension Canal. A PWD engineer said for indirect irrigation, the department could only ensure water to one-third of the tank capacity and the remaining quantum had to be managed with local rainfall and inflow.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-demand-release-of-water-through-tmc-branch-canal/article37676251.ece

Following a quarrel, he had strangled his wife with the mangalsutra. The convict, Suresh of Chinnamanur, was married to Karpagavalli, and they had two children. Suresh used to harass Karpagavalli, suspecting her fidelity. Karpagavalli lodged a police complaint in this regard. Following an inquiry, the police advised Suresh and closed the complaint. On July 21, 2015, following a quarrel between the two, Suresh attacked Karpagavalli in her stomach and private part, and strangled her with the mangalsutra. She was six months pregnant. After she fell unconscious, Suresh took her to Chinnamanur Government Hospital and told the doctors that she had attempted suicide. On examination, the doctors found ligature mark on her neck and her private part was swollen and bleeding. The woman succumbed to her injuries the next day. Suspecting foul play, the family members lodged a police complaint and a criminal case was registered. In 2020, the Additional District and Sessions Judge, Theni, found Suresh guilty of the offences. The Sessions Judge awarded death sentence for him for the offence under Section 302 (murder) and 10 years’ imprisonment under Section 316 (causing death of quick unborn child by act amounting to culpable homicide) of the IPC. The sentence was referred to the High Court for confirmation. A Division Bench of Justices V. Bharathidasan and S. Ananthi observed that while imposing the death sentence, the court should consider the aggravating and mitigating circumstances. After giving full weightage to the mitigating circumstances, the court should strike a balance between the aggravating and mitigating circumstances before imposing capital punishment. The court observed that the case fell short of the ‘rarest of rare cases’ category and commuted the death sentence to life imprisonment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-commutes-death-penalty-to-life-term/article37675812.ece

One death has so far been reported, and 348 cases have been reported in the last 23 days from various healthcare centres across Puducherry. A 55-year-old cook of Bahour died due to the the disease a few days ago. The number of cases was lower in October: only 297 cases were reported. On Tuesday alone, 20 cases were reported; of the total number of cases detected, two needed in-patient treatment. “We have seen an increase in the number of cases this month. The Health Department has started various measures on its own, and is also working with civic agencies to prevent mosquito-breeding,” G. Sriramulu, Director of Health and Family Welfare Services, told The Hindu. The Indira Gandhi Government General Hospital and Research Institute now has around 22 dengue patients. It has opened a 24-bed fever ward with the scope to increase the capacity. Similarly, the Government Medical College has opened a 60-bed fever ward, and has four dengue patients under treatment. Mr. Sriramulu urged residents to report to hospital immediately in case of symptoms such as fever, accompanied with headache and body pain, pain behind eyes, rashes and vomiting. In certain rare cases, there would be respiratory symptoms and bleeding. “It is very important that people consult a physician at the earliest. In the case of the death reported from Bahour, the feedback we received was that the patient came late for treatment. So, it is very important to get appropriate treatment,” he said. The Health Department had asked the civic authorities to prevent accumulation of waste that could store water, and the dengue mosquito could breed only in freshwater, he said. Residents should keep their surroundings clean and prevent water stagnation on their premises. Mr. Sriramulu said the Department had stocked up on medicines. It would hand over fogging machines to the Ariankuppam and Villianur commune panchayats to intensify the drive against mosquito-breeding. According to State Surveillance Officer L. Ravivarman, the dengue hotspots are Ariankuppam, Mudaliarpet, Saram, Muthialpet and Lawspet.

Jayakumar. He said this while addressing the party cadres before taking out a padayatra here on Wednesday against the anti-people policies of the Centre.

In a petition to Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, president of Karisal Bhoomi Vivasaayigal Sangam A. Varadharajan said cattle rearing, the chief profession of the farmers after agriculture in the district, is a prime livelihood for the farmers of Kovilpatti, Vilathikulam and Ettaiyapuram areas, where over 1 lakh goats and sheep are being reared. Since the viral infection causes heavy loss to the farmers during the northeast monsoon every year, vaccination of these domestic animals is very much needed. However, qualified veterinarians are yet to be appointed in the veterinary clinics in these areas, leaving the farmers at the mercy of the private practitioners. “After getting the prescription from the private veterinarians, the farmers themselves administer the injection to the animals. Since the district is getting good rainfall this year, the sheep and goats cannot be taken for grazing even as the prevailing weather condition is causing rapid spreading of cattle diseases. However, veterinarians have not been appointed in 56 government veterinary clinics across the district to further compound their woes. Hence, the government should appoint the veterinarians in these vacancies to save the cattle farmers,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-to-fill-up-vacancies-of-56-veterinarians-in-govt-clinics/article37676178.ece

Officials of the Highways Department said that a water pipeline of Tiruchi City Corporation broke near Oyamari, loosening the soil above it and causing the road to give away. The problem was not a large one, and would be solved by Thursday morning, the officials said. The pipeline was from a pumping station and was an old one, a senior official of the civic body confirmed. Water was being supplied through the pipeline to Ariyamangalam and Ponmalai areas. The civic body had begun work in the area, the official added. Vehicles have to navigate the hazardous stretch, which is also poorly lit with insufficient street lights. With incessant rain in these parts, it is a risky road to take, say motorists, who use the road daily. Earlier this year, a large part of the road along the bank of the Cauvery caved in during work undertaken to construct a retaining wall. The work was being undertaken by the State Highways as part of a pending project to relay the road when the excavation loosened the sand, officials said. The work was never completed and some parts of the road are yet to be asphalted said P. Ayyarappan, a road safety activist. “This keeps happening on that road and officials continue to attend to the problem every now and then,” he contends. Mr. Ayyappan wonders about the lack of a long-term approach to set right the road, by way of strengthening it, as yet.

Referring to the State having relied on a 1969 Supreme Court judgment related to a memorial for Mahatma Gandhi in Ahmedabad, he asked: “By relying upon this verdict, has not the Government acknowledged that the benchmark for establishing a memorial with public money can be justified only if the life and contribution of the person for whom the memorial is proposed approximates the life of Gandhiji and those of his ilk?” He went on to state: “In contemporary times, where there is a perceptible depreciation of ethical standards and corrosion of moral values which cumulatively leave their adverse impact on the constitutional responsibility and institutional integrity, there may not be too many leaders who may match the standards of those who gave their lives for the cause of the nation or the humankind.” He said, “In other words, if the life of a leader has only a relative value to some and not to the substantial number, then there is a risk of its becoming a memorial for a group of followers, and not the public, and may well fail in a judicial review of an alleged colourable action of the Executive.” He also took judicial note that the State had already constructed a phoenix-shaped mausoleum for Jayalalithaa at the Marina Beach by spending Rs. 80 crore in public money. “Veda Nilayam is only a few kilometres away from the phoenix memorial... What is the inspirational story that Veda Nilayam may provide which the Marina memorial does not?” the judge wondered. Justice Seshasayee said that in a country where a substantial number of its populace were struggling for a dignified life, and for whom Part III (fundamental rights) and Part IV (directive principles of State policy) of the Constitution were yet to become relevant, the court could not remain insensitive and play Dhridarashtra (the visually challenged king in the Mahabharata ) when the government decides to divert crores of rupees of public money mindlessly. “Fiscal prudence is the soul of fiscal management and is in-built in the governance of public affairs. As a prudent manager of public funds, it is the duty of the government to deploy public money where the investment fetches tangible returns to the public at large. It includes welfare measures for the public such as health, education, housing, transportation, and the list is endless,” the judge opined.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/proceedings-to-acquire-jayas-residence-quashed/article37675770.ece

25 November 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Lakhan Jarkiholi may weaken the chances of Cong. candidate||Candidates of both the BJP and the Congress are concerned with Lakhan Jarkiholi filing his nomination papers as an independent candidate in the Legislative Council polls from the double-member Belagavi- Chikkodi Rural Local Bodies Constituency. The two-member constituency now has eight candidates, including Mahantesh Kavatagimath of the BJP, Channaraj Hattiholi of the Congress and Shankar Hegde of the AAP. The others are independents, including Lakhan Jarkiholi. It is widely believed that Lakhan Jarkiholi’s entry into the fray will weaken the chances of the Congress candidate, rather than the BJP. One of his followers pointed out that there are a few reasons behind this. “Ramesh Jarkiholi and Balachandra Jarkiholi are in the BJP and will work for Mr. Kavatagimath. Ramesh Jarkiholi has also said that his priority will be to defeat the Congress. Satish Jarkiholi may openly say he will campaign for Mr. Hattiholi, but he is not too keen. That is because he thinks Mr. Hattiholi and his sister, Lakshmi Hebbalkar, did not campaign for him during the Lok Sabha bypolls,’’ he said. There is a general impression in the district that when it comes to the family’s interest, the Jarkiholi Brothers set aside their political differences. Rahul Nasipudi, a gram panchayat member from Gokak, said that he and his friends had decided to cast their votes for Lakhan Jarkiholi and Mahantesh Kavatagimath and not the Congress. “We have been told by the Jarkiholi Brothers to vote for the BJP as the second candidate,’’ he said. Lakhan Jarkiholi held a big show of strength rally in Belagavi on Tuesday, the last day for filing nomination papers. He spoke briefly to his supporters who had gathered on the Sardar School Grounds. They later marched with him to the Deputy Commissioner’s office where he filed his nomination papers. He came out and said that his supporters had gathered voluntarily and not on his instructions. “I am happy they came. But this is no show of strength,’’ he said. Balachandra Jarkiholi neither accompanied Lakhan Jarkiholi when he filed his nomination papers nor did he join the delegation of the BJP nominee Mr. Kavatagimath. Ramesh Jarkiholi was present when Mr. Kavatagimath submitted his nomination papers. Satish Jarkiholi told journalists that Lakhan Jarkiholi could withdraw his nomination papers if he was promised an important post in the Congress. Satish Jarkiholi said that the Congress had dedicated voters in the district, that would ensure the victory of the party nominee Mr. Hattiholi. But Lakhan Jarkiholi responded to this saying nothing would make him withdraw. Lakshmi Hebbalkar expressed the confidence that her brother [Mr. Hattiholi] will easily win. Bommai’s reaction Meanwhile, in Bengaluru, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai dismissed reports that Lakhan Jarkiholi’s candidature could affect the chances of the BJP nominee. “Lakhan Jarkiholi is contesting as an independent candidate. He is not in the BJP now anyway. His contest will not affect us. We will win the first round. I am sure Ramesh Jarkiholi and Balachandra Jarkiholi are with us and will support our candidate. They made it clear yesterday. Ramesh Jarkiholi even accompanied Mr. Kavatagimath when he filed his nomination papers. Anyway, I will speak to both of them to understand what happened,” he said. To a query, the Chief Minister also said that the Lakhan Jarkiholi’s case was different from that of A. Manju’s son. “The two incidents are different. They cannot be compared. For a long time, the Jarkiholi Brothers have been in different parties,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/lakhan-jarkiholi-may-weaken-the-chances-of-cong-candidate/article37675906.ece
25 November 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Police assure Christians of protection||A delegation of Christian leaders met Police Commissioner K. Thiyagarajan and expressed their concern over what they said rising attacks on minorities by Hindu right wing groups. They sought protection for prayer groups and other congregation of Christians in the city. Bishop Derek Fernandes, who headed the delegation, told the Police Commissioner that they were concerned over reports of such intolerant attitude and attacks on minorities. They were particularly concerned about certain media reports about the police advising some Protestant prayer groups to avoid conducting prayers in conventional halls and other public places. Bishop Fernandes also sought a clarification about the reports and urged the police not to restrain Christians from holding routine prayer services in halls and private places in a legitimate manner. The Police Commissioner denied that the police had acted that way. He told them that the police will provide adequate protection whenever necessary. Dr. Thiyagarajan said that he was misquoted by some media persons and said that neither oral nor written orders were issued by the police to any organisation. Officers will provide security to all prayer services that are held as per the traditions and customs of Christians, he said. The Bishop later told journalists that he was grateful to the Police Commissioner for his assurance. “There was a misunderstanding and confusion that was spread among Christians in the city regarding the alleged curbs imposed by the police. While prayers are being conducted in halls as per rights enshrined in the Constitution, we urge the police to ensure the safety of Christians,’’ he said. “We wish to inform you that like other religions, Christians too hold certain ceremonies and prayer sessions in their houses and elsewhere as per rituals and traditions. Sometimes, however, due to lack of place, some Christian groups are compelled to conduct prayers in rented halls or on private premises. What is more, during the Christmas season some groups will have open air celebrations and services. We requested the police to help observe these rituals peacefully,” he said. Pastor Nandu Kumar, Fr. Philip Kutty, Fr. Nelson Pinto, Louis Rodrigues, Clara Fernandes and Fr. Pramod Kumar and Louis Rodrigues were part of the delegation. Deputy Commissioner of Police Vikram Amathe was present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/police-assure-christians-of-protection/article37675905.ece

25 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Plan for new 90 km of drains at a cost of Rs. 900 cr. on the cards||After heavy rains caused widespread damage, inundating hundreds of homes and throwing life out of gear, the State Government, on Wednesday, firmed up its plans to widen and improve the carrying capacity of the city’s 842-km drain network. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai announced that there was a need for nearly 90 km of new drains, including 51.5 km of primary and 38 km secondary drains. This is estimated to cost around Rs. 900 crore. “The civic body has been directed to prepare the detailed project report (DPR) and submit it to the government. We will provide the required funds, on condition that it is completed in a time-bound manner,” he said. The civic body has also been asked to take up recruitment of 137 engineers on contract basis. On November 23, after inspecting rain-affected areas in Yelahanka and Byatarayanapura, Mr. Bommai announced a ‘master plan’ for storm-water drains, details of which were firmed up at a high-level meeting with senior officials at the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike’s (BBMP) head office on Wednesday. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, the Chief Minister said many rajakaluves (primary/ big storm-water drains) needed repairs and reinforced cement concrete structures. The drains in the 110 villages in the outer zones were mud structures, which need to be reconstructed and widened. “We need concerted efforts to clear these bottlenecks,” he said. The BBMP had identified 94 critical points in different zones. Work will be taken up at these points to minimise flooding and officials had been directed to complete the same within 2 months’ time, he added. The civic body has been directed to draft a master plan to ensure smooth flow of water from a series of lakes to the rivers through the four valleys in the city - Vrushabhavathi, Hebbal, Koramangala and Challaghatta. “There may have been a master plan earlier. However, layouts have now come up across the city. The new master plan should take into account the present conditions on the ground,” he said. With regard to strengthening of drains, he said that in 2019-20, the State Government had accorded permission to the BBMP to take up work on 75 km and sanctioned Rs. 1,060 crore. “Of this, work on 40 km has been completed and that on 30 km will be completed by January end,” he said. Mr. Bommai said that the civic body had also been instructed to take up repair of tertiary drains, apart from desilting all drains. “We will monitor the progress of all these works that are deemed as permanent solutions to the flooding issue. The Government has taken this issue very seriously,” he said. With a lot of work pending on laying the new underground drainage lines in the 110 villages, the Chief Minister said he has directed the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board to complete the work and ensure that there is no let off. Ministers C.N. Ashwathnarayan, S.T. Somashekhar, K. Gopalaiah, Munirathna, V. Somanna, B.A. Basavaraju, administrator and additional chief secretary Rakesh Singh, civic chief Gaurav Gupta and senior officials were present at the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/plan-for-new-90-km-of-drains-at-a-cost-of-rs-900-cr-on-the-cards/article37675729.ece

25 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Mahadevapura zone tops vaccination coverage||A total of 1.36 crore doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in Bengaluru. Around 80.57 lakh citizens (88% coverage) have received the first dose and 56.41 lakh (62% coverage) have got both shots. Among all the zones, Mahadevapura has the highest coverage with 98% for the first dose and 80% for both doses. While 98% of citizens in Yelahanka zone have received their first shot, coverage is relatively lower for the second dose at 73%. Special drive To further improve COVID-19 vaccination coverage, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), in association with the Care India Foundation, will soon have special vehicles that will go around the city for door-to-door administration of the vaccine. On Wednesday, BBMP Chief Commissioner launched the ‘Lasika Vahana’ drive with 80 two-wheelers and 16 vans. Each zone will get eight two-wheelers and two vans for the block and lane-level vaccination drive along with a data entry operator (verifier) in each vehicle. Pending vaccine dose To increase the vaccination coverage, block and lane-level vaccine drive was taken up. Those who are yet to receive the second dose are being identified. Civic health officials are also contacting them and reminding them about the pending vaccine dose, a release said. Health teams in the various Assembly constituencies have also taken up door-to-door vaccination drives. So far, around 70 wards health teams have visited and vaccinated around 35,000 people (including first and second doses).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mahadevapura-zone-tops-vaccination-coverage/article37675714.ece
25 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Only around 23% colleges in State apply for accreditation||Of the 3,595 colleges offering UG programmes in Karnataka, only around 23% have applied for accreditation by National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), as per the 2021 report recently published by the council. Across the State, 837 colleges have received their accreditation. This despite the fact that since 2013, it is mandatory for colleges to get accreditation. Many colleges have not initiated the process. In other cases, colleges whose accreditation has expired have also not come forward for the process. These include government, grant-in-aid and self-financed non-grant UG colleges. S.C. Sharma, director of NAAC, said that there was a need for greater sensitisation for colleges to come forward to complete the process. “Colleges are probably reluctant to apply as they may not meet all parameters. But we have written to the government stating that we are ready to handhold them through the process,” he said. College managements that The Hindu spoke to cited the pandemic as one of the reasons for not initiating the process. Some admitted that due to staff shortage, they decided to skip accreditation as they were worried about getting a poor rank. “Things are improving now as we have got good student strength. We hope to apply for accreditation within the next six months,” said the principal of a private college in Bengaluru. As per the revised accreditation framework introduced in 2017, a large part of the parameters are verified digitally in order to promote transparency. The assessment is conducted on parameters ranging from curricular aspects and teaching-learning to evaluation and research innovation, among others. The final grade is based on a statistical analysis of quantitative indicators, peer team review, and an institutional grade sheet that will be based on student satisfaction surveys among others. Based on the assessment, colleges are allotted one of the eight grades. If they obtain any grade other than D, they will be awarded accredited status. If they are graded ‘D’, they will get a remark stating that they are not accredited.  College managements that The Hindu spoke to cited the pandemic as one of the reasons for not initiating the process.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/only-around-23-colleges-in-state-apply-for-accreditation/article37675747.ece
25 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||What will be the impact of COP26 on Bengaluru and Karnataka?||The commitment made by our Prime Minister at COP26 in Glasgow demands a rapid increase in renewable power and early retirement of coal power plants. Karnataka can be a leader in the growth of renewable energy technology in India as it is already a leader in the area of information technology. There are many sites favourable for solar power plants in north Karnataka and locations favourable for wind power plants in the western Ghats and Bellary. Wind power is available mainly during the monsoon but it compensates for the poor yield from solar power plants during that season. There will be a need for large energy storage facilities to tide over the periods during which neither wind or solar energy is available. The large hydropower plants in Karnataka can be used for energy storage through ‘pumped storage’ systems. These systems will pump water from downstream of the dam to the lake located upstream during mid-day when there is more solar power generation. The cost of storing electrical energy in batteries is coming down rapidly. This will make renewable energy and its storage less expensive than power generated from new coal power plants in Karnataka. To enable India to attain the goal of reducing net emissions of greenhouse gases to zero by 2070, there will be a need to retire old and inefficient coal power plants. Climate change occurs on a variety of temporal and spatial scales. On a global scale we know that emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane lead to global warming. On a city scale, many other factors play a role. The maximum temperature in Bengaluru has increased by around 2 degrees in March during the past 100 years while the global mean temperature has gone up by around 1 degree during the same period. One cannot attribute all the warming in Bengaluru to carbon dioxide. A part of the warming is on account of the increase in built-up area, higher road traffic and destruction of greenery in Bengaluru. Global warming has increased the number of high rainfall events in India This has led to flooding in urban areas and landslides in hilly regions. Flooding in urban areas is partly a consequence of uncontrolled development that has not allowed the rain water to flow freely. To reduce flooding there is a need to promote construction of porous pavements and roads. In addition, we need enough green areas to soak up excess rainfall. While constructing roads in hilly regions, we must ensure that there is sufficient provision for the free flow of rainwater. When more of the rain falls as heavy downpour there is less rain during the rest of the monsoon season and this leads to droughts. This can be avoided if Karnataka becomes a ‘Kerenataka’ (a land of lakes) once more. In order to prevent landslides and floods in western Ghats, it will be necessary to prohibit mining and other development activities in this region. Greener plan for city The future climate of Bengaluru will depend primarily upon how we develop urban areas. There will be a need for more lakes and mini-forests and the city must become more friendly to pedestrians and cyclists. We have to make sure that all rooftops have solar panels or solar water heaters. We should promote the use of electric vehicles and buses. They will reduce vehicular emissions and air pollution. During the 19th and early 20th century, the kingdom of Mysore was known for its far-sighted novel initiatives for the development of the State. In the 21st century, Karnataka can become a leader for the sustainable development of India.

25 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Pay Rs. 10,000 per acre to farmers for crop loss due to rain: Congress||With standing crops on more than five lakh hectares damaged owing to excess rainfall in October and November, the State Congress has demanded the government pay compensation of Rs. 10,000 per acre to farmers. KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar and MLA and former Agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda on Wednesday held a press conference and urged the State Government to immediately commence the survey to assess damage to crops. Tahsildars have to receive applications and compensation should be disbursed to farmers in a month, they said. Mr. Shivakumar appealed to party workers to go to farmers and collect their applications and submit them to officials concerned for payment of compensation. They alleged that insurance companies had “looted” the farmers and the State Government’s share in the insurance premium paid by denying insurance to farmers citing various reasons. The government has “kneeled down” before the insurance firms, they alleged, and said farmers had not benefited from the Fasal Bima Yojana, a crop insurance scheme. Such insurance firms should be blacklisted and debarred from operations in the State, they said. They also demanded waiver of collection of land revenue this year from farmers who had lost crops owing to heavy rains. Mr. Shivakumar said the party’s delegation would call on Governor Thawarchand Ghelot on Thursday and submit a memorandum on the government’s failure to respond to farmers’ difficulties. Meanwhile, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah met some rain-hit farmers at Bangarpet constituency and heard their grievances.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pay-rs-10000-per-acre-to-farmers-for-crop-loss-due-to-rain-cong/article37675741.ece

In frustration, residents of Varthur took to cultivating staples on roads that bear more resemblance to fields, and highlighted their foray into agriculture on social media tagging the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board and Bangalore Electricity Supply Company. “Residents of Varthur began to cultivate staple food items from the same roads now converted into Agri fields as the basic right of movement has been deterred by irresponsible planning & execution of utilities lines,” said a citizens’ group on Twitter. Jagadish Reddy from Varthur Rising told The Hindu said that of 205 km of roads in Varthur ward, 165 km had been dug up by various agencies. What’s worse is that while the recent spate of heavy rains have made the situation worse, the lack of proper roads is a problem that residents have been facing for years, Varthur Rising members claimed. Due to the poor condition of roads, many cabs don’t ply in the area and neither do school buses. The condition has worsened following rains, said Mr. Reddy. “Citizens’ right to movement is hindered. We can’t even step out of our homes to buy groceries. The whole ward is ignored,” he said, and added that on Wednesday, a memorandum was submitted to the BBMP by the residents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/residents-grow-crops-on-mud-filled-roads/article37675720.ece

25 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Two arrested; phones, two-wheelers worth Rs. 2.6 lakh recovered||The Magadi Road police, on Wednesday, arrested a 50-year-old habitual offender, who was allegedly running a gang that stole two-wheelers and mobile phones. According to the police, the accused, Aslam Pasha, 50, is a gangster and a rowdy sheeter from J.J. Nagar. They identified him as the prime accused with the help of CCTV footage while probing a case. The police later arrested his associate Mohammed Usman and recovered two stolen motorcycles, and two phones worth Rs. 2.6 lakh from the duo. They also recovered Rs. 31,000 in cash. However, three other members of the gang managed to escape, and efforts are on to track them down, said a senior police officer. High drama prevailed for sometime when a police team moved in to secure Aslam at his residence. He reportedly created a scene and then fainted. Enraged by this, his family members and neighbours attacked the police team. “However, we secured Aslam to the station and later arrested his associate,” the police officer added. Apart from running the gang, Aslam also purchased stolen mobile phones from other muggers in and around the city. He would sell the devices to his contacts in other cities. This is not his first brush with the police. He was earlier arrested by Ashok Nagar police for a similar offence but was released on bail. “After he came out of jail, he shifted his area of operations from central to west division,” the police added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/two-arrested-phones-two-wheelers-worth-rs-26-lakh-recovered/article37675728.ece
25 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Magistrate court orders probe against police commissioner, 2 others||A magistrate court in the city on Tuesday ordered investigation against City Police Commissioner Kamal Pant, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central) M.N. Anucheth and Cubbon Park Police Inspector Maruty B. for allegedly delaying registration of First Information Report (FIR) in the CD scandal allegedly involving former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi. All the three officers on Wednesday moved the High Court challenging the legality of Tuesday’s direction of the magistrate court to the Cubbon Park Police to register a FIR against them and submit a report after conducting investigation into the allegations made in a private complaint. The VIII Additional Metropolitan Magistrate, Bengaluru City, on November 23 had ordered registration of FIR against the three officers based on the private complaint registered by one Adarsh R. Iyer, a social activist, on April 7, 2021. The complainant had filed the private complaint before the magistrate after the police had not acted on his complaint against the three officers. Private complaint It was alleged in the private complaint that the three officers have failed to register a FIR against Mr. Jarkiholi based on a complaint lodged by one Dinesh Kallahalli, also a social activist, on March 2, 2021, alleging that the then minister had sexually harassed a women. Though the private complaint was lodged on April 7, 2021, the magistrate court could not take it up for hearing due to restrictions in the functioning of the courts in the State as a consequence of the pandemic. The three officers, in their petition filed before the High Court through advocate P. Prasanna Kumar, explained that they have not disobeyed the law in not registering FIR based on Mr. Kallahalli’s complaint. Lack of information They have pointed out in the petition that investigation was carried out by the police as per the apex court’s guidelines by treating Mr. Kallahalli’s complaint as a petition as it lacked sufficient information to register an FIR and by taking cognisance of offence. Stating that Mr. Kallahalli could not provide sufficient material to lodge a First Information Report despite sufficient opportunities given to him, the officers have also pointed out in the petition that the FIR was registered on March 26 based on the complaint lodged by the victim herself.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/magistrate-court-orders-probe-against-police-commissioner-2-others/article37675710.ece
25 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC allows KSLU to hold exam for UG law courses||The High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday allowed the Karnataka State Law University (KSLU) to conduct examination for undergraduate law courses with a rider that the results would be subject to final order of the court. A Division Bench passed the interim order on an appeal filed by KSLU. The appeal was filed challenging an interim order passed on November 12 by a single judge, which had stayed the exams that were scheduled to be held from November 15. “ Prima facie, we find that students of colleges governed by KSLU are on a different footing than students governed by universities of other states as question of discrimination can be only among equals,” the Division Bench observed. The single judge had stayed the exams while prima facie agreeing with the contention of some of the petitioner students that holding exams for the students of KSLU amounts to discrimination as students of law of universities in other states were being promoted without holding exams. The Division Bench also found force in the argument of the KSLU that Sections 9 and 10 of the KSLU Act, 2009, related to powers of the State Government to issue directions to the varsity could have have any application to the issue of holding exam as it would be within the powers of the KSLU to conduct examination as per the statutory requirements. The single judge found that KSLU had decided to hold exams contrary to the directions issued by the State Government to promote students without holding exam in view of the pandemic. KSLU had contended that conducting exam for promoting students and awarding degree is a mandatory requirement otherwise the Bar Council India would not recognise their degrees. The Division Bench adjourned further hearing on the appeal after issuing notice to the students, who had approached the single judge, the BCI, and the State Government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-allows-kslu-to-hold-exam-for-undergraduate-law-courses/article37675739.ece

25 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Govt. will work with Railways to widen vents: CM||One of the reasons why K.R. Puram and other areas in the Assembly constituency get inundated during the rains is problems in the existing drainage infrastructure. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, while inspecting BDS Nagar in Horamavu ward on Wednesday told reporters that from the Hebbal valley, the water flows through K.R. Puram and Mahadevapura, before joining the Pinakini and reaching Tamil Nadu. From Hebbal valley, the water flows through a drain that is 125 ft wide. However, there is a huge overflow near K.R. Puram on account of the narrow vent that comes under the jurisdiction of the railways. “The Government will coordinate with the railway officials concerned with regards to widening of the vent to allow free flow of the huge volume of water. This will prevent flooding in these parts. The Government will sanction the funds required for the project,” he said. He added that there was a need to widen another vent near Arkavathy Layout. The Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) had been directed to take up this work. Further down this point, the drain will need strengthening with reinforced cement concrete until it reaches Kalkere lake. This work would be taken up shortly. The work on widening of the main drain from Nagenahalli lake and linking it to the Hebbal valley by constructing a new drain for 3.5 km would also be taken up soon, said Mr. Bommai.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-will-work-with-railways-to-widen-vents-cm/article37675727.ece
25 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Eggs to be provided with midday meals||Taking note of the rise in the number of children who are malnourished and anaemic in north Karnataka, the Department of Public Instruction has decided to provide eggs to students in government and aided schools in seven districts from December. This has been a long-pending demand among many organisations and stakeholders for several years now. Eggs will be provided to students in Bidar, Raichur, Kalaburagi, Yadgir, Koppal, Ballari,and Vijayapura. Students who do not consume eggs will be given bananas along with their noon meals. As many as 14.44 lakh students from classes one to eight are likely to benefit from this move. Eggs or bananas will have to be supplied to students 12 times a month and school managements are allowed to decide on which days they will provide eggs. Students are likely to be given eggs thrice a week. Schools will be given Rs. 6 per child 12 times a month. This initiative will continue till March. School managements have been asked to monitor and file reports on the health indicators among each student. Welcoming the move, Veena Shatrugna, former Deputy Director of National Institute of Nutrition, said it was a good beginning, but added that going forward the government should extend it to all children in the State as eggs were essential proteins for children’s growth. However, many public health experts have said that providing eggs merely thrice a week may not help in reducing malnutrition. “Malnourished children need to get protein at least five to six times a week so that there is some improvement in their health,” said a doctor working in a government hospital in the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/eggs-to-be-provided-with-midday-meals-in-7-nk-districts/article37675716.ece

A Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum, passed the order while disposing of the PIL filed by Honnavara Taluk Hasimeenu Vyaparastara Sangha. Contrary to the claim of the petitioner that the project was being developed in turtle nesting area, the Bench found from a survey conducted by the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management, Chennai, that no turtle nests, turtles or carcass of turtles were found on the 45 hectares of land identified for the project. The survey was conducted as per an earlier direction issued by the court. On location of the port, the Bench said that it was for the experts to determine it. The Bench also noted that the Deputy Commissioner of Uttara Kannada had already clarified to the court that there was no change of location of the port after the environmental clearance was granted for the project.

25 November 2021||Bengaluru/Hubballi,KARNATAKA||‘Global trends will give a fillip to Hubballi valve industry’||Karnataka’s ‘Chota Mumbai’ Hubballi has emerged as a key hub for all kinds of valves and related accessories and started contributing significantly to domestic and exports markets. The city’s valve ecosystem currently has over 200 valves and valve accessories (pumps, actuators, instruments, products, and other services meant for the valve industry) manufacturers that employ over 20,000 people and clock an annual turnover of over Rs. 1,000 crore with exports accounting for over 50% of that. These firms comprise micro, small, medium enterprises and also MNC players such as Trillium Floor Technologies and Flowserve Corporation. President of the newly set up Hubli Valve Manufacturers’ Association Shivanand Awati told The Hindu that Indian valves market was currently in an interesting phase since major global players had shifted their focus to India, considering the upbeat investment scenario and slow-down in West Asia and Europe. “This opens up further growth potential for Hubballi which is already a significant player in the valve industry,” he said. How critical are valves? Industrial valves are devices used to control the flow of liquids and gases through pipelines. If proper valves are not used, the process industry handling liquids and gases could become hazardous and it may lead to mishaps, environmental degradation, or loss of lives. Industrial valves may be classified based on the type of function: manual or power operated, modulating or control valves. Based on the construction they can also be divided as linear valves (globe, gate, sluice, knife gate, piston valve, diaphragm, and pinch) or rotary valves (ball, plug, and butterfly), as per the trade body. Most valves are manufactured in stainless steel, nickel alloy or other metals that are corrosion and erosion resistant with the capacity for high holding pressure. Per unit price of a valve ranges from Rs. 200 to Rs. 20 lakh. “This price range says something about the range we play. Interestingly, Hubballi is a critical player in all categories of industrial valves. As a thumb rule, valves and pumps account for 5% to 10% of the total project cost for process industries,” Mr. Awati said. Chemical process industries, petroleum, petrochemical, and allied industries, refineries, oil and gas industries, fertilizer and sugar industries, drugs, pharmaceuticals and chemicals, food, brewery and beverage industries, power generation industries, water supply treatment and wastewater management, nuclear industries, pesticides manufacturing, shipping services, steel plants, mining and mineral processing are some of the key valve consuming industries. Government support However, according to Ninganna S. Biradar, president, North Karnataka Small Scale Industries Association (NKSSIA), Hubballi’s valve ecosystem has taken a beating in the last decade as key consuming sectors slowed down on procurement. “Government support and incentives are required for the business to double and grow exponentially. Also, the government has to attract companies to Hubballi–Dharwad. We have the right environment and ecosystem, people, talent, and expertise,” Mr. Biradar said. NKSSIA has already asked the State Government to work out a special programme to get the valve industry in the region into the next orbit of growth. It also asked for the revival of NGEF (New Government Electrical Factory) in Hubballi to help small vendors and suppliers and also to boost the overall ecosystem. Echoing similar sentiments, Mr. Awati said: “Government support is a must for the industry to get into the next level of growth. The economic and employment potential is huge. In the coming years, industrial valves market is expected to post significant growth, attributed to new industrial infrastructure development projects, repair and renovation of existing industries, and expansion in the gas pipeline network.” Industry landscape The country’s valve and ancillary industry is spread across Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, and Gujarat with Hubballi, Coimbatore, Pune, Tiruchirappalli, Chennai, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Vadodara, and Ahmedabad playing lead roles. As per a CII report, the market is expected to witness a CAGR of 5.9% between 2018 and 2023.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/global-trends-will-give-a-fillip-to-hubballi-valve-industry/article37675738.ece

25 November 2021||HYDERABAD,KARNATAKA||At this hospital, pay to hold your baby for the first time!||Poor attendants of women who had a delivery at the Modern Government Maternity Hospital, Petlaburj, are allegedly forced to shell out anywhere between Rs. 2,000 and Rs. 6,000 to the staff there in order to avail various services. Among the services for which money was ‘unofficially’ collected by the hospital staff includes handing over the newborn to the family (Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 3,000 or sometimes more), shifting the new mother post delivery from one section to another on a stretcher (Rs. 300 to Rs. 500), and vaccination (Rs. 500). For those who are lucky, the staff sometimes make exceptions and demand money only for a single ‘service’. Financial burden To put it in perspective, the amount constitutes 30% to 50% of the financial assistance of Rs. 12,000-Rs. 13,000 under KCR Kit Scheme. Since majority of the patients come from a poor background, their attendants have to forego their daily wages, or salary for a week or more for the hospital stay. Added to their woes of losing a few days’ salary, they had to pay huge amounts to the staff on duty, according to several attendants of the new mothers admitted at the maternity hospital Sharing an unpleasant experience at the Petlaburj facility, Md Yosuf said a staff member forced him to pay Rs. 3,000 to hand over his newborn daughter. “Then they demanded Rs. 300-500 to carry my wife on a stretcher from one ward to another. I work as a driver. Every rupee counts. Since I do not get money unless I attend my job, I borrowed Rs. 500 from my brother to meet daily expenses. But then, I had to pay the hospital staff. I was worried they might harm my baby if I did not pay the money,” he said. Attendant of another patient, Ghouse Moinuddin said he used to work at a fruit shop but has been at the hospital, along with his wife, for over 10 days. His daughter recently delivered a child. Sitting outside a ward, he said,“I do not even know if I will get back my job after such a long gap. Even while staring at possible jobless days, we had to pay over Rs. 3,500 to the staff. We will get Rs. 12,000 as part of KCR Kit Scheme, but the money each family has to pay to the staff here is almost 30% to 50% of that assistance.” Authorities unaware? Many other families raised similar complaints when The Hindu spoke to them. Some said money was demanded to even give medicines to the newborns. They wondered how this ‘clandestine’ business has been thriving at the hospital and has escaped the notice of higher authorities. The superintendent of the maternity hospital could not be reached for a comment.

25 November 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Pachchanady road overbridge thrown open to traffic||The new road overbridge over the Mangaluru-Mumbai railway line on Bondel-Vamanjoor Road at Pachchanady was informally thrown open to traffic on Tuesday after work on approach roads was completed. Southern Railway’s construction wing dismantled the six metre wide and 9.25 metre long old overbridge to facilitate line doubling between Mangaluru Junction and Panambur in 2017. The Railways then provided a temporary level-crossing, about 300 m to the south of the old overbridge. The work gained momentum in May this year when two concrete abutments were built and five girders were erected. Though the work on the overbridge was completed last month, it was not thrown open to public as the approach roads were to be built. The Bondel-Vamanjoor Road, a key stretch connecting the Airport Road and Mangaluru-Karkala National Highway 169, was closed for all kinds of traffic for over a month to facilitate construction of approach roads. Mangaluru City Corporation recently widened the road and concreted them. Though Southern Railway undertook construction of the new road overbridge with a width of 12 metres and a length of 27.95 metres at an estimated cost of Rs. 5 crore, the abnormal delay in the completion of the work had irked road users. Vehicle users had to wait for long at the level-crossing with the Mangaluru-Mumbai line being one of the busiest. The new and wider road overbridge provides hassle-free movement of vehicles, said Southern Railway. Tall parapet and return walls were constructed on either side of the overbridge as the 25 kV traction passes beneath the bridge. Approach road Approach roads on both sides of the overbridge were built by the construction wing of the Southern Railway. While 150 m of approach road was provided on the Bondel-side, 100 m of approach road was provided towards the Vamanjoor side. Work on the approach roads that began on October 10 was completed on November 1, followed by a three-week gap to allow concrete to get cured, said officials from Southern Railway. The execution team comprised Deputy Chief Engineer (Construction, Mangaluru) S. Vinoth Kumar and Assistant Executive Engineer (Construction, Ernakulam) S. Anil Kumar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pachchanady-road-overbridge-thrown-open-to-traffic/article37676261.ece
25 November 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Four arrested on the charge of abduction and murder||The Puttur Rural Police arrested four persons said to be involved in the abduction and murder of a photographer from Mysuru. The police gave the names of the arrested persons as Balakrishna alias Subbaih Rai, his son Prashant, Prashant’s wife Jayalakshmi and their neighbour Jeevan Prasad. According to the police, the photographer, 58-year-old Jagadish, had taken a two-acre agriculture land in Aryapu village of Puttur taluk on lease three years ago and had allowed his uncle Balakrishna to cultivate it. On November 18, Jagadish came to Aryapu village in his car and spent some time on his land along with Balakrishna. He left in his car in the evening. As he was not traceable, Jagadish’s brother Shashidhar filed a complaint that his brother has gone missing. A few days later, Shashidhar filed another complaint accusing Balakrishna and his son Prashant of kidnapping Jagadish and causing him harm. The police registered a case under Section 364 (kidnapping). Meanwhile, investigation revealed that Balakrishna and the other three accused murdered Jagadish and buried the body in a forest area near the house of Balakrishna.

25 November 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Sexual assaults raise concern over child safety at workplace||The sexual assault and murder of an eight-year-old girl on November 11 in a tiles factory on the outskirts of the city has raised concerns over the safety of children of people employed at construction sites, fish processing units, tile factories, hotels and other workplaces. Four men, including three workers of the tiles factory, were arrested in connection with the rape and murder of the girl, the eldest of the four children of a couple working in the factory. The incident comes after a two-year-old girl survived a sexual assault at a fish processing unit in Hoige Bazaar here on November 1. “Both these incidents show the absence of proper arrangements for care for children of workers in these units,” said Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar. In the absence of crèche or watch and ward staff, the children are susceptible to assault, kidnapping and other offences, he added. In the tiles factory, there were 31 labourers, which included 21 from Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand. The others are locals. Of 31 labourers, six were women. There were six children of these labourers. They stayed in different sheds on the premises of the tiles factory. The police said that the accused sexually assaulted the girl, murdered her and abandoned the body in the drain. Similarly, the two-year-old survivor was among a group of children of labourers working in the fish processing unit in Hoige Bazaar. These labourers too stayed in sheds nearby. The survivor was found in a bin filled with salt water, which is used in the unit to process fish. The girl was admitted to Government Wenlock Hospital. The police arrested Chandan, a native of Bihar, who worked in the unit. District Child Welfare Committee Chairman Renni D’Souza said that the Factories Act and the new Central Scheme on contract labourers mandate establishing a crèche for workers children.“Apart from providing a secure environment, the crèche will help look after health and educational needs,” he said. However, there is no provision to penalise establishments that do not set up a crèche. Mr. D’Souza, also a child rights activist, said that he will write a letter asking the district administration to set up crèches for children of labourers hailing from different parts of country. Departments, including Labour, Women and Child Welfare, Education, Social Welfare, should be involved in running this crèche. Civic society should also chip in, he said. Mr. Shashi Kumar said the police will be visiting establishments that employ people from other States and submit a report to the district administration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sexual-assaults-raise-concern-over-child-safety-at-workplace/article37676269.ece

25 November 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘Integrate technology in higher education’||Kerala Governor Arif Mohammad Khan on Wednesday favoured integration of technology in higher education for making it more accessible and less expensive as the pandemic brought to the fore the importance of digital education for continuity in learning and how the world, especially India, embraced it so fast. Speaking after inaugurating the award ceremony-cum-film screening of the 23rd UGC-CEC Educational Video Conference and Prakriti International Documentary Film Festival at the University of Mysore here, Mr Khan said the National Education Policy-2020 has laid thrust on digitization of education. The Consortium for Educational Communication (CEC), New Delhi, which has been developing digital educational content, has the onus for taking digital education across India, he suggested. The Governor said the digitisation of education progressed a lot amidst the pandemic. The relevance of digital-enabled educational content has gained significance post-COVID-19 too, he said. The CEC was developing digital educational content before the pandemic and it also developed video lectures in sign language, Mr. Khan informed. Favoring the model of “anywhere education and examination”, he said at least two universities in each State should be developed as “future-ready” centres of higher learning, with effective utilisation and incorporation of world-class technology. He told students that innovative ideas and the drive to push beyond the limits are key for success, besides critical thinking and acquiring new skills in the emerging world. Referring to the award-winning documentaries to be screened at the film festival, Mr. Khan said films can make narratives impressive. The visual medium is very impactful, especially those on subjects like the environment and issues concerning climate change are in need of immediate attention and documentaries can help in reaching out the message, he felt. The Governor said educational institutions have greater responsibility of imparting moral, ethical values, and traditional knowledge among students. “India is ancient but not old, as it has been renewing because of its people with the successive generations coming up with new ideas and thinking.” Praising the University of Mysore, Mr. Khan said he was visiting the university for the first time. “I am very happy to be here and thankful to the Vice-chancellor and its officials for their affectionate welcome.” On the occasion, Vice-Chancellor G Hemantha Kumar delivered the keynote address while CEC Director Jagat Bhushan Nadda presented the festival address. EMRC Director H. Rajashekar and CEC Joint Director Sunil Mehru were present. The screening of films and documentaries will be held from November 24 to 26 at Vijnana Bhavan for students and the university staff. This is the second time the event, organised jointly by the UGC and CEC in collaboration with Educational Multimedia Research Center (EMRC), Mysuru, is being hosted by the university.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/integrate-technology-in-higher-education/article37676035.ece
25 November 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||JD(S) is helping BJP by not fielding candidates in all seats, says Zameer||Former Minister and Congress leader B.Z. Zameer Ahmed Khan on Wednesday said that the JD(S) was trying to help the BJP in the Legislative Council elections by not fielding candidates in all seats going to polls on December 10. On a visit to Mysuru, Mr. Khan said the JD(S) had fielded candidates in only seven constituencies. With elections for 25 seats, Mr. Khan claimed that the party had left 18 constituencies only to help the BJP. It may be mentioned here that elections will be held for 25 Legislative Council seats in 20 local authorities’ constituencies. Mr. Khan said the JD(S) was only targeting the Congress. During the recent byelections, the JD(S) had fielded only candidates from the minority community to help the BJP. Though former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy has been claiming that the party was focusing on the next Assembly elections, Mr. Khan said the JD(S) will be reduced to single digits in the 2023 Assembly polls. Mr. Khan also denied any rift between him and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah. Referring to the reports that Mr. Siddaramaiah had cut short his speech at a recent party function in Bengaluru when his supporters shouted slogans, Mr. Khan said the former Chief Minister had wound up his address in a short time as he was scheduled to attend an event in memory of Kannada actor Puneeth Rajkumar. Mr. Khan said he could not attend the event as he was away in the national capital, but spoke to Mr Siddaramaiah over the phone. Mr. Khan claimed that the former Chief Minister was actually delighted that his supporters shouted his name even in his absence. Referring to Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai’s inspection of rain-hit areas in Bengaluru, Mr. Khan said the Chief Minister’s trips would not serve any purpose. He said the Chief Minister neither heard the woes of the people nor has he announced any compensation so far. Mr. Khan, who visited the house of former corporator Akram and participated in a Kanakadasa Jayanthi programme at Nanjumalige Circle on Wednesday, said he will also call on Suttur Mutt seer Shivarathri Deshikendra Swami.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/jds-is-helping-bjp-by-not-fielding-candidates-in-all-seats-says-zameer/article37676038.ece
25 November 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Rain induced crop loss drives vegetable prices up||Crop loss owing to recent heavy rains have led to vegetable prices skyrocketing, with farmers staring at a loss and consumers feeling the pinch in Mysuru and surrounding regions. While tomato rates have hit a new high and is over Rs. 100 per kg, other vegetables like beans too is racing upwards and was being quoted at Rs. 80 per kg. People are cutting down on the consumption of tomatoes and beans while there is an increase in the use of green leafy vegetables. But the farmers are not the beneficiaries of the skyrocketing price of vegetables. While the prices have risen owing to a supply-demand mismatch, it has been wrought about by waterlogging as a result of which vegetables are rotting in the field, according to Nagaraj, a vegetable farmers and member of Raita Mitra, a farmers’ producer company. He said more than 100 farmers in Bardanpura village in Mysuru taluk alone have taken up tomato cultivation on a large scale and are now in dire straits as the crop was rotting. ‘’Though we had a good harvest the incessant rains have damaged the vegetables which were ripe and ready for harvesting,” he added. Spraying insecticide to cover 1 hectare of land costs around Rs. 18,000. Though the exercise was completed heavy rains washed away the insecticide while rendering the exercise useless. As a result the yield per acre also declined and against harvesting 1,500 crates [of 22 kg per crate] of tomato, farmers were able to harvest only 300 crates, according to Mr. Nagaraj. Though the price is Rs. 100 per kg, let alone a profit, farmers are unable to recover the cultivation cost, he added. Tomato is cultivated on a large scale in Mysuru, K.R. Pet, K.R. Nagar, Srirangapatana, H.D. Kote, Pandavpura and bulk of it is the hybrid variety that are costs more to cultivate and hence the loss incurred by the farmers is also more, according to Atahalli Devaraj of the Federation of Farmers’ Association. Apart from incessant rains, the overflow and run off from the village tanks and waterbodies is also causing waterlogging in the fields adding to the crop loss. Meanwhile, the farmers in the region have urged the Government to appoint more surveyors to assess the crop loss. At present, only one surveyor has been appointed for each hobli and this was grossly inadequate, according to Mr.Nagaraj and Mr. Devaraj, who said that surveyor would be forced to rush through the assessment to submit the report within the deadline.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rain-induced-crop-loss-drives-vegetable-prices-up/article37676040.ece

Hailed as one of the best performing districts in vaccination coverage, Kodagu on Wednesday administered vaccines to 11,281 persons as against the target of 8,000, registering 141 percent progress. The number of persons vaccinated was updated till 5.30 p.m. The total number vaccinated on this day was 7,78,660 persons (39%) as against the target of 20 lakh.

Mysuru stands 10th among the best performing districts. Chamarajanagar is rated among the poor performing districts based on the achievement it made in the drive held on Wednesday as it could register 26% progress in coverage, vaccinating 13,004 persons as against the target of 50,000. The target set for BBMP in Bengaluru was 3.5 lakh but it could achieve 40,710 coverage, registering 12% achievement. Zero cases Meanwhile, Kodagu has reported zero COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, after a gap of many months since the second wave. It was categorised as one of the high-risk districts earlier this year because of its proximity to Kerala where the pandemic had caused havoc with unrelenting cases though infection rate dropped in other neighboring states. With tight vigil in areas bordering Kerala, the authorities could prevent spread cross-border transmission. Also, Kodagu is also among the top districts with highest vaccination coverage. Kodagu has 57 active cases. No deaths were reported on Wednesday. “The district’s positivity rate is now 0%,” said Deputy Commissioner B.C. Satish.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/with-141-progress-kodagu-tops-state-in-covid-19-vaccination/article37675910.ece

25 November 2021||IDUKKI,KERALA||Water level increases in Idukki reservoir||The water level in the Idukki reservoir rose on Wednesday following the trial stopping of one of the six generators at the Moolamattom power house. The water level reached 2,400.44 ft at 5 p.m. An official of the Dam Monitoring and Research Station said it was unusual for the power plant to operate all the generators for maximum power generation during the rainy season. The dam was mainly reserved for power generation during the summer season, when demand escalated. Maximum generation He said, however, due to the persistent spell of rainfall, all generators were being operated for maximum power generation. It was during the rainy season, the annual maintenance works of generators were done. “One of the generators was not operated on Wednesday and it would be back to normal in two days,” he said. The fall in tunnel discharge mainly led to the increase in the water level, he said adding that dam safety officials were monitoring the situation. There was a wide gap to the upper rule level now as the present level was at blue alert. However, considering the chances of rainfall and inflow through the Periyar, the Cheruthoni dam could be opened to regulate the water level. He said a decision would be taken by the rule committee at Thiruvananthapuram. As the inflow into the Mullaperiyar dam declined, Tamil Nadu officials on Wednesday closed six of the seven spillway shutters that were opened on Tuesday. Only one was kept raised to 10 cm. Following heavy inflow, the spillway shutters were opened on Tuesday night releasing around 4,000 cusecs to the Periyar. In Mullaperiyar On Wednesday morning, the water level at Mullaperiyar declined to 141.45 ft. The water level at 5 p.m. was 141.35 ft and the tunnel discharge was 2,300 cusecs and the water release to the Periyar was 136 cusecs. The average inflow into the dam at 5 p.m. was 2,271 cusecs. The upper rule level is 142 ft. As per the rule curve for the Idukki reservoir, the orange alert level is at 2,401 ft, red alert level at 2,402 ft, and the upper rule level at 2,403 ft. A Kerala State Electricity Board official said following water release from Mullaperiyar, the water level in the Idukki dam rose by 0.14 ft in a day. The water level may fall in two days if there was no heavy rainfall.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/water-level-increases-in-idukki/article37675793.ece
25 November 2021||KALPETTA,KERALA||Survey a farce, says committee||The Nilgiri-Wayanad NH and Railway Action Committee has alleged that the survey launched by the Konkan Railway Corporation Limited (KRCL) for the proposed Thalassery-Wayanad-Mysuru rail line was a farce. The ongoing survey would cost Rs. 18 crore to the exchequer but it would not benefit the State in any manner, T.M. Rahseed, convener of the action committee, said. Moreover, the Karnataka Government and the Railway Board were yet to permit the agency to conduct the survey. Karnataka had decided not to go ahead with the project owing to the stiff opposition from the Forest department officials there, Mr. Rasheed said. Why should the Kerala Government spent such a huge amount for a project that was not certain to be approved, he asked. As many as five feasibility studies, including two during the British era, had been conducted for the railway line since 1910 but all them had found that the project would not be remunerative, Mr. Rasheed said. Alternative line In contrast, a recent study of the Delhi Metro Railway Corporation on the proposed Nilambur–Sulthan Bathery-Nanjangud railway line had said that the project was the only feasible one as it would reduce the rail distance between Shoranur and Mysuru from 617 km to 253 km. The Nilambur–Sulthan Bathery-Nanjangud project would benefit entire Kerala and would provide port outlets for Mysuru, Bangaluru, and hinderlands of Karnataka. The Kerala Government had approved the final location survey for the Nilambur-Nanjangud railway line, he said. However, now the government was trying to sabotage the project by launching the heli-borne survey after the intervention of a Kannur lobby, he alleged. Hence, the government should withdraw from the survey and recover the amount incurred from the officials concerned, Mr. Rasheed demanded. Meanwhile, traders’ organisations in Sulthan Bathery have decided to take out a march to the helipad at Sulthan Bathery on Thursday against the alleged attempts to subvert the Nilambur-Nanjangud railway line project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/survey-a-farce-says-committee/article37675927.ece

Speaking after launching a 12-hour fast in front of the collectorate here on Wednesday, raising a slew of demands including adoption of pragmatic steps to mitigate man-animal conflict, Mr. Mohanan said the plight of the public, including tribespeople, living on the forest fringes was beyond imagination but it seemed the government was yet to consider the issue seriously. A pragmatic solution was the need of the hour to address the issue and it should be executed with public participation, he said. The criteria for providing compensation in animal attack should be decided scientifically, Mr. Mohanan said . District Congress Committee president N.D. Appachan inaugurated the fast.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/steps-sought-to-mitigate-man-animal-conflict/article37675920.ece

The State Government has proposed the extension of Marine Drive up to Vaduthala, covering Mulavukad and Pachalam areas. It has been estimated that an approximate area of 329 hectares will be available as land mass in the project area, including islands. Incidentally, islands account for around 119 hectares, which could be developed into an ecological conservation zone, according to the Kochi Waterfront Development Project, as proposed by the consultancy service unit of the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). The area set apart for the projects will see an environmentally sensitive, sustainable and energy-efficient development model, which will take into consideration the “existing communities who would be the major stakeholders,” according to the project document. A high-rise development will be adopted as the main mode of infrastructure creation in the project area. Development activities will be confined to a buffer of 250 metres from the water line. The construction of roads, common services, and utilities will require 10.6 hectares, whereas 30.19 hectares will be available for construction, it is estimated. Transit spine The planners have proposed a ‘transit spine of 50 metres’ along the shore, which will act as its “lifeline consisting of walkways, cycle paths, carriageway, and service roads forming an almost circular loop connecting into the existing roads.” The land, according to the proposal, which will be available beyond the development area will see “incremental development in terms of better infrastructure, amenities, and public spaces.” According to the project presented at a meeting convened by the Chief Minister in Thiruvananthapuram on Tuesday, areas starting from Pachalam, Vaduthala, and Mulavukad will be developed at a length of 9.1 km. A bridge connecting Mulavukad and Vaduthala has also been suggested. The special purpose vehicle (SPV) will have representatives of the Kochi Corporation, Greater Cochin Development Authority, Goshree Islands Development Authority, and the local bodies concerned as its members. The State Government will be the main advisor for the SPV, which will be entrusted with the task of preparing the master plan and obtaining all statutory clearances. Once the master plan is finalised, a notification will be released designating the area of development, and survey will be initiated, it is suggested.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vast-built-up-area-to-be-for-sale-under-marine-drive-project/article37676235.ece
25 November 2021||Kochi,KERALA||High veggie prices hit family budgets||The price of tomato, an essential ingredient in everyday cooking, has gone up to between Rs. 100 and Rs. 120 a kg in markets across the State. The price looks set to rise in the near future with heavy rain lashing every part of Kerala and neighbouring Tamil Nadu and Karnataka from where most of the commodity is sourced. Scientists studying extreme climatic conditions and the relation to farm production hint at tomato prices giving us a glimpse of the shape of things to come. Soil erosion, flooding of fields, and increasing humidity have disrupted farming operations. Soil erosion will call for more fertilizer application while increasing humidity will trigger more pest attacks. In Kerala’s rice barn Palakkad, 3,975 ha of paddy crop has been lost to heavy rain. The loss has hit more than 10,600 farmers, says an official of the Agriculture Department. 1.86 lakh farmers hit Crops across the spectrum, from ginger and turmeric to Nendran banana and tapioca, have taken a hit. As per estimates, 55,919 ha has been hit by extreme weather between October 12 and this week. The crop loss has hit 1.86 lakh farmers and the loss is estimated at Rs. 700 crore. Alappuzha has recorded the maximum loss at 25,743 ha while 9,284 ha in Thrissur has seen affected. Tapioca has also taken a hit, the crop vulnerable to flooding. B. Ajithkumar of the Department of Agricultural Meteorology, Kerala Agricultural University, says Kerala has received heavy rain this season. The season’s rainfall between October 1 and October 6 has seen a 68% increase against the long-term average. Shortage of supplies N.H. Shameed, a vegetable wholesaler in Kochi, attributes the rise in vegetable prices to a shortage of supplies from locations in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Big onion, tomato, cool season vegetables, potato, and garlic are sourced from other States, he says. According to estimates, Kerala produces around 12 lakh tonnes of vegetables a year. An equal volume is imported from other States yearly though no figures are available for the actual import volume. S.S. Nagesh, head of the agriculture division of the Kerala State Planning Board, says the Subhiksha Kerala programme, launched in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak for intense agricultural activities, has resulted in significant increase in farm production. But he warns of the climatic conditions in which the loss of sunny days, among other problems, leading to more obstacles for farm production.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/high-veggie-prices-hit-family-budgets/article37676016.ece

The shipment contained over 2.5 tonnes of pineapple and was sent by the Delhi-bound Nizamuddin Express from the Ernakulam South station on Wednesday. According to James George Thottumariyil, association president, the consignment is sent to Diem Agro LLP, an agri business start-up incubated at Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar, and funded by the Agriculture Ministry. The start-up is developing an online marketplace for fruit and vegetable farmers, especially for pineapple farmers in Kerala, to market their produce among interstate buyers. Usually, pineapple is sent to north India by road in trucks which take five days to reach Delhi, while by rail, it reaches in 50 hours, Mr. Thottumariyil said. “Thus, we can offer fresher fruits this time to the market, and if the experiment succeeds, we have plans to send bigger consignments regularly,” he added. The association is getting tremendous support from the State Horticulture Mission - Kerala and the Railway Ministry. “Kisan Rail, which was launched in August last year, was in touch with us for sending fruits by rail and when the right time came, we took up the task,” he said. The GI-tagged Vazhakulam Pineapple is always getting attractive trade queries from north India, and the State Horticulture Mission - Kerala and the Railways have offered attractive incentives to send bigger consignments, he added. Farmers in Kerala cultivate pineapple in around 18,000 hectares and produce 5.5 lakh tonnes of the fruit at the moment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/in-a-first-over-25-tonnes-of-pineapple-sent-to-delhi-by-train/article37676233.ece

In her note, Mofiya Parveen, 21, from Edayapuram in Aluva, accused Inspector C.L.

He was delivering the inaugural address at ‘food street’, a protest organised by the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) district committee against the Sangh Parivar agenda by distributing free food, including meat, here on Wednesday. The DYFI launched the protest to counter the BJP’s campaign against hotels selling ‘halal’ food. “People ruling the country and their affiliates should introspect whether it suits a democratic and secular country that people have to fight for their right to eat the food of their choice. It [giving communal angle to matters of food] is a dangerous trend, which should be strongly opposed,” said Mr. Paul. He added that halal was not a complex issue, but food sanctioned under the social and religious ways of a community about which the rest of society should not have any problem. Hotels do not have religion, and even the ones identified with some communities tend to make it their unique selling point by focusing on their speciality food, which the Malayali community used to enjoy regardless. “Mixing poison in food is not permitted under the law, and the Sangh Parivar is undertaking a unique experiment of mixing an even more dangerous poison of communalism in food,” said Mr. Paul. DYFI district secretary A.A. Anshad said food streets were organised at all 14 district headquarters as part of the organisation’s ongoing campaign against the Sangh Parivar agenda. “The choice of food is my freedom, and no one else can intervene in it. While anyone has the right not to eat some food, they cannot dictate what others should eat,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/autonomy-to-choose-food-being-usurped/article37676238.ece

The Crime Branch (CB) probing the case has sought the help of local fishermen to find it in addition to the experts already engaged. It is learnt that local fisherfolk may have netted a hard disk but dumped it back into the water on finding it useless. Though the investigators were not sure whether it was the same hard disk, searches were held along the location based on feedback. The police team had already taken the help of the scuba diving team of the fire force as well as the Coast Guard to find the missing hard disk, but in vain. The police suspect that the hard disk might contain visuals that could prove to be crucial evidence in the case. The accident turned controversial after it emerged that the ill-fated car was followed by another car driven by a person identified as Syju Thankachan who had moved an anticipatory bail plea and has since then gone untraceable. The CB continues to collect statements from those who attended the party on the fateful night. Once Syju is tracked down, he will be questioned, sources said. Besides, Roy J. Vayalat, the hotel owner, and the first accused, Abdul Rahman, both on bail, will be questioned again, if needed. The former is recuperating after a medical procedure he underwent recently for cardiac ailments. The accident killed three, including two models, after the car driven by Abdul Rahman had rammed a tree on the national highway in the early hours of November 1. The driver was since then found to be under the influence of alcohol.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kochi-accident-hunt-for-hard-disk-continues/article37675990.ece

Compared with the 1980s, the warming of the south-east Arabian Sea has exceeded by more than 1°C, surpassing the maximum sea surface temperature of 29°C in 1980s to greater than 30°C in 2020s. The warming in the Arabian Sea is about 1.5 times that of the rest of the world’s oceans. This has huge consequences in the form of increased frequency of deep (cumulonimbus) clouds even during the monsoon, leading to very heavy to extreme rainfall and cloud-burst type events. It is also alarming to learn that the warming in the south east Arabian Sea has paralleled the warming of the west-Pacific where the frequency of severe typhoons (cyclones) is on the higher end. The collaborators in the study include P. Vijaykumar, Baby Chakrapani, and K.Mohankumar from Cusat and O.P.

According to farmers, torrential rain in the latter part of monsoon has hit the harvesting of the Virippu (monsoon) crop across the region, besides bringing to light gaps in post-harvest storage management. The delay in concluding the season has also cast a shadow over the next cycle of cultivation as well. The region’s farm calendar stipulate the Virippu season to begin in May-June so as to complete the harvest by October-November. A timely completion of the monsoon crop will enable the farmers to launch the next season, Punja , by mid-November. Any delay in concluding the Punja season by March involves the risk of more losses due to summer rain, as witnessed in April this year. Flattened crop Officials of the Agriculture Department say unrelenting rain had flattened matured crop in several hectares and this will cause loss of lustre and yield, besides increasing the harvesting cost. Taking note of the situation, the department has now approached the Government for additional measures such as installation of more pumps to drain out water-logged polders. “The changing rainfall pattern over the last couple of years has upended the farming calendar while the shortage of harvest machines is the latest addition to the woes of farmers. A process is on to ascertain the exact loss sustained through crop flattening this season,” says Beena George, principal agriculture officer, Kottayam. Grim situation As per preliminary estimates, nearly half of the 4,653.13 ha under the Virippu crop has been affected. Even in locations where harvest is over, rain has left its mark on the grain by causing germination or decay. Farmers under the aegis of the Upper Kuttanad Karshika Vikasana Samiti and the Meenachil-Meenanthara- Kodoor river relinking initiative have submitted petitions to Agriculture Minister P. Prasad seeking Government intervention to tide over the crisis. The samiti, meanwhile, has also urged the Government to extend the deadline of reporting crop loss from November 15, besides raising the compensation from Rs. 5,400 per acre. All eyes are now on a visit by the Minister to the district on November 27 to attend a district-level meeting of the department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/torrential-rain-upends-farm-calendar/article37675976.ece

Surendran Pillai, one of its State general secretaries, from the party and removed three other leaders, including Sheikh P. Haris from their positions as State office-bearers of the party, for their alleged violation of party discipline. A press release issued by party State president M.V.

25 November 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||NMC retains draft regulations on stipend||The National Medical Commission (NMC) seems to have rejected the stand of the erstwhile Medical Council of India (MCI) on stipend for medical interns as the draft regulations on their compulsory rotating internship have been gazetted without any changes. The Draft Regulations issued on April 21, 2021, had said that all interns shall be paid stipend “as fixed by the appropriate fee fixation authority as applicable to the institution/ University/State”. They were gazetted on November 18. The erstwhile MCI, however, had come up with a public notice on January 25, 2019, on Graduate Medical Education Regulations, 1997. The Board of Governors that superseded the MCI was considering to include a provision that said: “all the candidates pursuing compulsory rotating internship at the institution from which MBBS course was completed, shall be paid stipend on par with the stipend being paid to the interns of the State Govt. Medical Institution/Central Government Medical Institution in the State/ Union Territory where the institution is located.” However, it was not gazetted until the Board was dissolved. High Court order The Kerala High Court, in an order on October 29, 2015, had directed PMS College of Dental Science and Research, Thiruvananthapuram, to pay stipend to the BDS interns at at the rate of what is being paid to the government dental colleges in the State. K.V. Babu, Kannur-based public health activist, pointed out that the vague provision on stipend in the draft regulations would give room for private medical college management to deny stipend to MBBS interns. In a mail to the NMC in July, Dr. Babu had sought reframing of the provision to: “all the candidates pursuing compulsory rotating internship at the institution from which MBBS course was completed, shall be paid stipend on par with the stipend being paid to the interns of the State Govt. Medical Institution/Central Government Medical Institution in the State/Union Territory where the institution is located.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nmc-retains-draft-regulations-on-stipend-for-medical-interns/article37675939.ece

The event is being organised by Kozhikode-based Grand Cycle Challenge with an aim to help the tourism sector in Kerala regain its old glory post the pandemic. The tour will be led by Sahir Abdul Jabbar, the Cycle Mayor of Kozhikode, and will be accompanied by 10 other cyclists from different parts of the State. The tour will be flagged off by Tourism Minister P.A. Mohamed Riyas in Thiruvananthapuram on December 4. It will conclude in Kasaragod on December 14. The seven expatriate riders, Salim Valiyaparamba, Faisal Kodanad, Salah Anappadikkal, Abdu Salam, Anwar, Noufal and Noufal Charaan, represent DXB riders, a cycling club in Dubai. “They are coming to Kerala at their own risk on a 14-day leave, only to be part of the ride out of their commitment towards cycling and their motherland,” said Sahir, the team leader. Shahul BosQ, Naseef Ali and Riyas Konkath are the other riders who are part of the event. Mr. Sahir said that the cyclists themselves were bearing most of the expenses, though there are a few sponsors for the event, and the Tourism Department is backing the venture. The eleven riders will travel across 14 districts of the State covering 1,200 kilometres. Photographs and videos of the ride will be showcased at an exhibition to be held in Dubai and Sharjah after the event. They will also be circulated across the world through cycling networks, Mr. Sahir said. “Our aim is to organise this ride every year on the same date, on the lines of Tour- de- Nilgiri which is a coming together of riders organised by the Karnataka Government,” said Sahir, wishing that the event would get better backing from sponsors and the government in the coming years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pedalling-to-help-kerala-tourism-regain-its-glory-post-pandemic/article37675929.ece
25 November 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Visually-impaired student seeks help to recover lost laptop||A visually-impaired research student at the University of Calicut is seeking the help of kind-hearted people to locate her laptop that she lost during a visit to Kozhikode city recently. According to K.M. Sheriff, Associate Professor and Head of the Department of English, where C.S. Sayoojya, the student, is pursuing research, the incident happened on November 3. She had come to the city with a group of students by a car. The vehicle was parked near the Akashavani building on the beach at 4.45 p.m. and the students went out. They returned in 45 minutes and had tea outside a nearby hotel before returning to the university. Only after reaching the campus Ms. Sayoojya realised that the laptop was missing. It is an HP laptop 15-da1041TU, with a product serial number CND9385VN1 and product number 6FS90PA. Mr. Sheriff told The Hindu on Wednesday that some one might have cleverly opened the locked door of the vehicle and snatched it away. “More than the loss of the equipment, what worries us is the loss of her research material stored in the laptop. It was the result of her years of hard work. Ms. Sayoojya is a bright student who cleared the exam for the University Grants Commission’s Junior Research Fellow when she was in second semester of her M.A. course,” he said. Ms. Sayoojya is a native of Guruvayoor in Thrissur district. Mr. Sheriff also said that some one might have sold it to people engaged in sale of second-hand laptops in Malappuram and Kozhikode districts. He said that he was willing to buy back the laptop from such sellers and hand it over to Ms. Sayoojya. Though a police complaint had been registered, it is reportedly not making any headway. Mr. Sheriff said that the CCTV footage from near the Akashavani building and the restaurant should be examined. Meanwhile, the All-Kerala Research Scholars’ Association too has intervened in the issue. Urging second-hand laptop dealers to inform them if they come across the laptop, the association said a research student’s future was at stake.  More than the loss of the equipment, what worries us is the loss of her research material. It was the result of her years of hard work K.M.

But the Azhiyoor grama panchayat in the district had kick-started an initiative to check the water sources much before. According to sources, two community volunteers from each ward and 18 ward members were trained to check the quality of water recently. They were given special kits for the purpose. As many as 200 water resources are being examined in the first phase. The panchayat is also taking action against those who discharge sewage into drinking water sources. Legal action Two restaurant owners, 14 building owners, and a cattle centre were served notices. The panchayat is planning to invoke provisions of the Panchayati Raj Act to levy Rs. 10,000 as fine from them and launch further legal actions if these people did not toe the line in a week. Meanwhile, the Health Department said that 11,330 water sources had been chlorinated as part of its ‘Operation Vibrio’ campaign so far. As many as 15,941 houses were examined.

Visiting Thusharagiri under the aegis of All Kerala River Protection Committee on Wednesday, the noted water conservationist and Magsaysay Award winner said that the State Government should take the initiative immediately to protect the dense forest area at Thusharagiri. “This is the birthplace of a baby. These rivers are the babies of this forest area. The biodiversity, waterfalls and forest land here is as holy as the womb of a mother”, Mr. Singh said. He said that the real farmers were those who protected the environment, taking a jab at the original owners of the disputed land at Thusharagiri. The State Government had confiscated land from them 20 years ago after complaints of widespread tree felling in the ecologically fragile area. Since then, under the Forest Department, the area flourished into a dense evergreen forest. Mr. Singh called upon all sections of people to come forward to protect Thusharagiri. He expressed solidarity with all campaigns being held to protect the Thusharagiri forest area. Mr. Singh was accompanied by T.V.

The Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) made it possible for a group of nature and heritage enthusiasts here on Wednesday to have a spectacular view of the geographical wonder that connects Kerala with its neighbouring State of Tamil Nadu. The rock named Kunnampidari Mala at Sixth Mile in Kozhinjampara panchayat, near Chittur, remains one of the least climbed hills in the district. Sweeping view “It’s amazing. Being in Palakkad, we cannot afford to miss the real charm of the 40-km wide Palakkad Gap. Nowhere else do we get to see that sweeping view of Palakkad Gap,” said J.G. Menon, former chief general manager of NABARD. A Siva temple welcomes the visitor at the foothill, from where it takes a comfortable climb to reach the Kunnampidari Amman Kovil. A few more steep steps take one to the top. “If the weather is clear, you can see the Western Ghats abruptly ending at Walayar in the north and at Nelliampathy in the south,” said Arun Narayanan, convener of INTACH in Palakkad. As the temple has weekly pujas, very few people bother to climb this rock every day. “The breathtakingly panoramic view apart, the rock offers so much of calm and quiet. It’s an amazing place to meditate,” said Rajesh Unni, a senior member of INTACH. Although the hill is least climbed by tourists, the INTACH team had a handful of plastic waste to carry back from Kunnampidari Mala on Wednesday. “That’s the saddest thing. Even an almost virgin mount like this is littered. We need to inculcate the idea of responsible behaviour among people visiting such places,” said Mr. Narayanan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/unravelling-a-panoramic-view/article37676174.ece

The State Government is keenly looking at the possibility of establishing a ‘Renewable Energy Park’ in the coastal locality that would tap into a variety of energy sources. The Government has constituted a committee to study proposals made by the Vizhinjam International Seaport Ltd (VISL) and the Agency for New and Renewable Energy Research and Technology (ANERT). Way forward The five-member panel, chaired by the Secretary, Ports Department, will “decide upon the requirements, way forward and timely implementation of the Renewable Energy Park at Vizhinjam,” a November 16 order said. Geographical advantages Given Vizhinjam’s geographical advantages, a renewable energy park there can explore the potential of wind (onshore and offshore), solar, biomass and wave power, said Dr. Jayakumar, Chief Executive Officer, VISL. In subsequent phases, the electricity generated through renewable energy projects can be used to generate green hydrogen through electrolysis, he added. While the park is not part of the international seaport, it is an allied initiative, government officials said. While granting environmental clearance for the seaport project, the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) had recommended the promotion of renewable energy tapping available sources, said Narendra Nath Veluri, CEO, ANERT. A 1 MW project for tapping wave energy is already on the cards with support from IIT-Madras. It would be scaled up if found successful. The five-member committee constituted by the State Government has the VISL CEO as convener, and the VISL managing director and the CEOs of the Kerala Maritime Board and ANERT as members.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/energy-park-on-the-cards-at-vizhinjam/article37676274.ece

Billed as a ‘five-year action plan,’ the document, titled ‘Tvm and You’ was released here on Wednesday by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. The document lists over 125 projects being implemented by the State and Central Governments and in public-private partnership mode. It offers information on initiatives falling under the broad categories of surface transport, airport, Vizhinjam port, city infrastructure, knowledge-based industry and digital initiatives, tourism, environment, social infrastructure and media and culture. For every project, it seeks to provide a short description with its present status, funding pattern, critical milestones, implementation agency, the department and Assembly constituency involved apart from remarks on requirements. Generating awareness TCCI president S. N. Raghuchandran Nair told a press conference that the document was meant to create awareness among citizens and also act as a support mechanism in spurring the city’s development and sustainable growth. The document will be distributed to elected representatives as it can help them keep track of the projects in their respective constituencies and wards, he said. Of the Rs. 31,309.73 crore, projects worth Rs. 16,704.5 crore are under implementation, while those worth Rs. 14,605.23 crore have been cleared, according to the document. Tvm and You also provides a parliamentary constituencies and assembly constituency-wise break-down of projects.

25 November 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Health Ministry pulls up Kerala||The Union Health Ministry has come down heavily on the Kerala Government for the less than transparent manner in which it has been reporting COVID-19 deaths. The ongoing COVID-19 death reconciliation exercise, which has added 8,684 deaths (October 22-November 22) in a space of one month to the State’s COVID toll, completely belies its claim that it has managed the pandemic well, a death analysis report by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) has said. The State’s case fatality rate has now jumped from 0.3% to 0.73%. The allegation that the State it not declaring all COVID deaths or including all deaths of COVID-positive persons on its official list of deaths has been there from the initial days of the pandemic. The State has never offered a clear explanation for the inconsistencies in death reporting, gaps in data and the unusual disparities in COVID mortality rate between districts when these were pointed out. Ex gratia The State was forced to release the backlog of “undeclared” COVID deaths, make death reporting online directly from hospitals and undertake a death reconciliation exercise only after the issue of ex gratia to the families who lost their kin to COVID was raised by the Supreme Court. The report calls it “shocking” that in the one month from October 22 to November 22, apart from 1,789 new deaths, the State reported a backlog of 8,684 deaths, which constitutes 83% of the total 10,473 deaths reported during the period. “By deliberately not declaring COVID deaths and straining to push the narrative that Kerala had the lowest case fatality rate, at no point during the pandemic did we have the true picture about COVID’s real impact. And that, when mortality reduction should have been the only goal before the Government. If the Government had been more transparent about data sharing, the collective wisdom of the State’s clinicians could have helped the State evolve more focussed strategies to bring down deaths,” a public health expert opined. As for disease transmission, Kerala continues to present a unique picture and has remained on a plateau consistently for the past few months. Testing levels have come down drastically to between 50,000-60,000 tests daily.  Even when it has been reporting an average of 5,000 new cases daily for the past few weeks, over 40% of the new cases reported are breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated individuals. The active case pool has been declining steadily and hospitalisations and ICU occupancy too have come down sharply over the past few weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/health-ministry-pulls-up-kerala/article37675992.ece
25 November 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||SilverLine in five years, says K-Rail||Apparently stung by the criticism of the SilverLine project by noted engineer E. Sreedharan, the Kerala Rail Development Corporation on Wednesday issued a press note seeking to counter the points raised by the former Railway Board member. The press note quoting K-Rail Managing Director V. Ajith Kumar said the SilverLine project was planned on a fast-track basis to be completed in five years at a cost of Rs. 63,941 crore. If land could be acquired in two years, SilverLine would be completed in another three years. He, however, admitted that more years of acquiring land would lead to cost escalation and non-viability of the project. On Tuesday, Mr. Sreedharan had rubbished K-Rail’s claim to complete the project in five years, saying that even the best executing agency in the country would take eight to 10 years for execution. DPR awaiting nod Mr. Kumar said the detailed project report (DPR) was awaiting the final approval of the Railway Board. “The Ministry of Railways has cleared the proposal for foreign funding and NITI-Aayog has recommended to the Finance Ministry to go ahead with the process,” he said. A comprehensive environmental impact assessment (EIA) study was in progress. The DPR, he said, was a commercial document and hence could not be released in the public domain. He explained that the SilverLine would run parallel to the existing road from Kasaragod to Tirur. A parallel route from Tirur to Thiruvananthapuram was not possible as there were many curves and hence a new route was planned for this stretch. ‘No cause for worry’ The press note said the embankment for SilverLine would not cause flooding and that protective fencing would be erected around the tracks where the train travels at a speed of more than 140 kmph. Defending the decision to base the SilverLine on the standard gauge, Mr. Kumar said the current broad-gauge system in India did not allow a train to run above 160 kmph.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/silverline-in-five-years-says-k-rail/article37676008.ece

She expressed her utmost happiness at having her baby back. In the afternoon, she walked out of the Family Court at Vanchiyoor in the capital with her baby tightly wrapped in a towel, and accompanied by the activists and the legal team who aided her in the fight. With media vans in tow, she headed straight to the protest venue in front of the Kerala State Council for Child Welfare where she had been sitting with her husband, B. Ajith Kumar, for the past few days. She then left for her residence. Expresses gratitude Speaking to mediapersons later, Anupama expressed her delight. "I express my gratitude to all those who have supported me in this fight. Even when there were social media attacks against us, so many of them wrote in our support. I also thank the couple from Andhra Pradesh who took good care of him, treating him as their own son for around four months. We will raise him as a good human being. We might not be able to provide him a luxurious life, but we will ensure that he will grow up to be a good human being," she said. Anupama said she remained unwavering in her earlier stand to continue her protest until action was taken against the officials of the Child Welfare Committee who had allegedly given the child in an illegal adoption. "I will not end this protest. The nature of the protest might change, which we will decide and announce tomorrow. We will strongly continue with our protest until we feel that a deserving action has been taken against the officials involved. It was only after we got the support of the media that the issue was exposed," she said. Lapses reported A departmental inquiry, which the State Government had earlier ordered, had reportedly found that there were lapses on the part of the Child Welfare Committee and the Kerala State Council for Child Welfare officials.

25 November 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Minister asks DTPCs to tap unexplored tourist sites||Tourism Minister P.A. Mohamed Riyas has said the District Tourism Promotion Councils (DTPCs) have a vital role to play in identifying unexplored destinations across the State. Addressing a two-day familiarisation programme for the newly appointed DTPC secretaries held by the Tourism Department here on Wednesday, the Minister said it was also important that DTPCs take utmost care in maintaining the valuable tourism assets in their respective areas. “It is primarily your responsibility to explore the unexplored destinations. The Government has a perspective about tourism that development of this key sector should also bring benefits to the people. The DTPCs should function in tune with the Government policies,” Shri Riyas said. The Minister also urged the DTPCs to ensure total transparency in their functioning and focus on completing projects in a time-bound manner. Referring to the caravan tourism project, he said the DTPCs could also identify potential sites for setting up caravan parks. Mr. Riyas said discussions were on to ensure inter-departmental collaboration for several initiatives.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dtpcs-asked-to-tap-unexplored-destinations/article37675970.ece
25 November 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Hospitals left with unused vaccines||Private hospitals which have unused COVID-19 vaccine stock with them are looking to the State Government now to help them out by buying it back at least at subsidised rates. During May-July, when the demand for vaccines was huge and vaccine supply from the Centre was erratic, it was on request from the State Government that many private hospitals stepped in to facilitate the COVID-19 vaccination drive. Many major private hospitals bought bulk orders directly from manufacturers. Small and medium hospitals found it difficult to purchase vaccine directly because of the stipulation that a fixed minimum order had to be placed and the Government allowed them to place their orders through its supply network Expiry period “When the demand was huge and the Government’s supply was restricted, many hospitals bought between 10,000 and 20,000 doses paying huge amounts. The expiry period is one year, so there is no issue on that count. But once the vaccine supply issues were sorted out, people naturally flocked to Government vaccination sites. Many small private hospitals now have unused stock — approximately 2-3 lakh doses — whereas major hospitals are managing their stock by taking up vaccinations in corporate houses and firms,” says A.V. Jayakrishnan, chairman, IMA Hospital Board of India. Though the Kerala State Medical Services Corporation had bought 10 lakh doses of Covishield vaccine for purchase by private hospitals, nearly 9.2 lakh doses were given to the Government hospitals as there were no more takers from the private sector. “It is up to the Government now to act and to ensure that the stock available with the private sector is utilised properly by subsidising it and prioritising it for the poor. The vaccination campaign had been intense when the Government was pushing everyone to take the first dose. That momentum seems to have been lost now and the second dose uptake is slow and poor,” Dr. Jayakrishnan says. Health Department officials said that with nearly 96% coverage of the first dose vaccine completed, the daily uptake of first dose had dwindled to 8,000-10,000 doses while close to two lakh second doses were administered daily. Comfortable “The State’s vaccine stock position is comfortable and people can walk in or register ahead for vaccination. But now, strange enough, people are not so keen on completing the second doses on time. When we started out with the first dose, people were jostling at all centres to get the vaccine. Now, health workers in the field have to call and beg people who are overdue for the second dose to take it,” a senior health official says. “We feel that people no longer fear COVID-19 or think that it cannot do much harm. The lifting of restrictions on civil life has given them the feeling that the pandemic is over,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hospitals-left-with-unused-vaccines/article37676001.ece

Sathidevi said on Wednesday. In a message on the eve of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women that falls on November 25, Ms. Sathidevi stressed the need to dismantle the male-dominated social structure and create awareness about gender justice and equality. She also called for radical changes in the justice system and the social and health sectors to achieve this objective. Ms. Sathidevi urged women to imbibe the need for financial security and self-reliance and redefine their role in marital life, the family set-up and raising children. “Eliminating atrocities against women will require a whole set of changes in society,” she said. Noting that the recent dowry deaths had cast a slur on the State, she said it was time society woke up to the need to redefine gender relations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/call-for-drive-to-boost-gender-justice/article37676283.ece
25 November 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||CM responsible for child trafficking, alleges Opposition||Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan on Wednesday said the abduction and trafficking of Anupama S. Chandran’s infant had the backing of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and a set of Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] leaders. Mr. Satheesan said the child was exiled to Andhra Pradesh with their knowledge and consent. Some CPI(M) Ministers were also part of the plot to deny a mother her natural-born child. It is tantamount to human trafficking. Intervention of CPI(M) Polit Bureau member Vrinda Karat and CPI(M) Central committee member P. K. Sreemathy at the CM’s level yielded no result. Mr. Vijayan chaired the State Child Welfare Council (SCWC) and his silence was conspiratorial, he said. Mr. Vijayan had maintained a similar enigmatic silence when Tamil Nadu inadvertently revealed that Kerala had given covert consent to strengthen the baby dam at Mullaperiyar, he said. The hastily withdrawn order had nearly scuttled the State’s prospect for obtaining Supreme Court sanction for building a new barrier to replace the 126-year-old levee and cast 40 lakh people living downstream in a permanent state of fear, he added. Main culprits Mr. Satheesan said the CPI(M) appointees at the helm of the SCWC and the Child Welfare Committee were the main culprits. They had tweaked official records to erase the identity of the child. They blotted out Anupama’s visits to the Council in search of her child, which was abandoned in the electronic cradle against her wishes. The Opposition leader said there was an attempt to present another child for DNA testing to thwart Anupama’s claim of biological parentage. The Council had gone ahead with the adoption process despite Anupama’s protest, and its actions were patently illegal. The CPI(M) has attempted to enforce the party code in all arms of the Government. The ruling party acted as if it was the law and the State. The government had protected an officer found aiding the accused in the infamous Uthara dowry-related murder case in Kollam, said Mr. Satheesan. In Aluva, the officer insulted a dowry harassment victim, prompting her to commit suicide. The law student had damned the Circle Inspector in her suicide note. The officer had received a posting because of his CPI(M) connections, he alleged. Stating that women and children had no protection in the State, Mr. Satheesan said the Government paid lip service to gender justice and equality but acted in a patriarchal and misogynist manner.  Some CPI(M) Ministers were part of the plot to deny a mother her natural-born child, says V.D.

Agriculture Minister P. Prasad presented the State’s case at a meeting of State Agriculture Ministers convened by Union Minister for Chemicals and Fertilizers Mansukh Mandaviya on Tuesday. Integrated approach Kerala banks on judicious fertilizer application and an integrated approach to nutrient management for agricultural expansion given the presence of distinct ecological zones, diverse crops and limited land availability. However, in the past few months, the State had not been receiving even its allotted quantity of fertilizers. Allocation so far Farmers were in distress due to fertilizer shortage as the rabi crop had already been raised, the Minister said. They were already battling hardships caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and natural calamities, Mr. Prasad added. The State’s allocation for November is as follows — 6,300 tonnes of urea, 3,000 tonnes of diammonium phosphate (DAP), 9,000 tonnes of muriate of potash (MOP) and 14,650 tonnes of complex fertilizers. As on Tuesday, the State had received only 2,981 tonnes of urea, 87 tonnes of DAP, 1,300 tonnes of MOP and 4,353 tonnes of complex fertilizers. This was way short of the State’s requirement, Mr. Prasad said. Data In November 2020, the fertilizer usage in the State was as follows — 11,206 tonnes of urea, 2,579 tonnes DAP and 11,608 tonnes of MOP. The data revealed the plight of the farmers due to the shortfall in fertilizers, the Minister said.  P.

Govindan here on Wednesday. Through the project, small loans are provided for poor families at low interest rates with a system of weekly repayments. The project targets daily wage workers, small traders and poor families who often end up depending on lenders who charge cut-throat interest rates. The project was launched in Palakkad in 2018, with the Kudumbashree district mission jointly implementing it with the help of various cooperative banks. It was later expanded across the State. In the current financial year, loans of Rs. 535.65 crore were provided to neighbourhood groups through cooperative banks. The project is being implemented by 2,386 neighbourhood groups through 456 Community Development Societies (CDS) in association with 586 cooperative banks. The Kudumbashree organised a survey to identify the families who had fallen into the debt trap. Loans up to Rs. 50,000 are given for one-year period under the project.

The  Kudumbashree Mission and farmers under the Mattathur Labour Cooperative Society have been supplying kadali bananas, one of the main offerings at the temple, for the past 12 years. Kadaleevanam, a project to ensure sustainable income for the farmers, was started in 2009 on the initiative of former Minister C. Ravindranath. According to the contract between the Kudumbashree Mission, Guruvayur Devaswom, and the cooperative society, 4,000 kadali bananas will be distributed to the Guruvayur temple a day. “Around 500 farmers were cultivating kadali bananas in around 125 acres in Kodakara block. We used to supply banana to the Guruvayur and Thiruvambadi temples before the lockdown,” says K.P. Prashant, secretary Mattathur Labour Cooperative Society, which procures the commodity from the farmers. Loss during lockdown The first COVID-19 lockdown came at the peak of the harvest season. As the temples remained closed, there were no takers for the bananas, which used to fetch Rs. 45-50 a kg, and the farmers suffered a heavy loss, he says. Farmers are now happy as the temples are opening as usual for the devotees. But they are apprehensive too. “Farmers have not been cultivating the kadali plantain for the past six months as they incurred a heavy loss following the second lockdown. If we start cultivating the banana, it will be ready for harvesting only next August,” says Mr. Prashant. Farmers are apprehensive that outsiders may chip in to fill the demand now, which may undermine the Kadaleevanam project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/guruvayur-devotees-bring-cheer-to-kadali-farmers/article37676000.ece

If lack of rain for more than 55 days led to drying up of the crop in August/September, excess rain in the last few days has left the fields in a sheet of water, said Public Accounts Committee chairman and Telugu Desam Party Uravakoda MLA Payyavula Keshav. Visiting groundnut, cotton and chilli fields in Belaguppa mandal in Uravakonda Assembly constituency, Mr. Keshav lamented the extent of loss that the groundnut farmers have suffered, some of whom have lost 100% of their investment, while 80% of cotton farmers were staring a bleak future as the crop was hit at a time when the cotton balls were in the growing stage. Chillies are the third major crop in these parts, and rain came at a time when the crop was ready for the first cutting in some fields and second in others. Heavy rain led to the dropping of flowers and the entire plant falling to the ground. The State Government must assess the loss in a realistic manner and provide compensation to the farmers, he told reporters after the visit. Meanwhile, farmers in Lakshmumpalli and Goddumarri have asked Singanamala YSRCP MLA Jonnalagadda Padmavathi to get their villages identified as flood-inundated areas so that they could get some compensation to offset the losses. Paddy, banana and other crops were badly hit, said Ms. Padmavathi, who toured the villages to console the farmers. Ms. Padmavathi said the Agriculture and Horticulture Department officials were asked to make realistic assessments and then fix compensation. “While Lakshmumpalli is already identified as flood-affected, the damages and condition in Goddumarri village would be assessed and then decided about its status,” she pointed out. She promised to get the best possible assistance from the government after speaking to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-mla-tours-rain-hit-agri-fields-in-belaguppa/article37676086.ece

25 November 2021||ANANTAPUR/KURNOOL,ANDHRA PRADESH||Many opt for govt. hospitals as vaccine is free, says official||The vaccination programme in the five private hospitals in Kurnool and Anantapur districts has seen little activity for the past three months as there were no takers for the paid ones as the vaccine is available free-of-cost in government facilities. Three of the five hospitals have stopped vaccination and have no stocks left. In Anantapur district, the two private hospitals have so far administered 45,000 first doses and 1,500 second doses. Explaining the wide gap between the two figures, District Immunisation Officer P. Yugandhar said now that the vaccine is available free-of-cost without any restrictions for all aged above 18, some of those who took the first dose of Covishield or Covaxin in a private facility would have taken the second one in the government hospital. Now, while KIMS Saveera Hospital has stopped the vaccination process, Akbar Eye Hospital continues conducting the programme. Here, Covaxin is administered even if only one person goes, but those wanting to have Covishield administered need to come in a group of 10 as a single vial contains ten doses, the hospital staff explained. Anantapur district was originally given a target of administering vaccine to 28 lakh eligible population, but was later revised to 32 lakh. The district has vaccinated close to 87% of the new target with one dose and above 45% with both doses. Vaccine hesitancy “We are campaigning in rural areas for people to take the second dose, but vaccine hesitancy is hampering the process,” explains Dr. Yugandhar. The health department personnel are now going from door-to-door to vaccinate people in both Kurnool and Anantapur districts to reach 100% of the target. In Kurnool district, while KIMS Hospital, Gowri Gopal, and Medicover Hospital were given permission to hold vaccination programme, KIMS and Medicover hospitals had stopped vaccination as there were no stocks with them, according to District Immunisation Officer K. Visveswara Reddy. While the Reliance had tied up with Medicover to vaccinate people, it has been discontinued now, and 146 persons, who had taken the first dose under that scheme, are yet to take their second dose. While 260 persons, who had taken the vaccine separately at Medicover, were also yet to take the second dose, and 17 persons who had taken the first dose from KIMS Hospital in Kurnool were yet to take their second dose, Dr. Visveswara Reddy explained. Kurnool district, however, as a whole had achieved a 97% target of administering first dose and 57% of the second dose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/many-opt-for-govt-hospitals-as-vaccine-is-available-free-of-cost/article37676088.ece
25 November 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Shortage of drug hits thalassaemia patients||Yousra Iram, 27, a Bengaluru-based audit and research officer living with thalassaemia, is worried as she is unable to get her life-saving iron chelation injection Desferal 500 mg from her usual suppliers. Desferal is widely used to remove excess iron from the body that accumulates as a result of frequent blood transfusion. If not taken regularly, the excess iron will damage vital organs. Although Ms. Iram was taking the drug thrice a week earlier, her doctor has now advised her to take it daily as there is excess build up of iron in her body. “But we have not been able to get this injection for the last 18 days and are desperately contacting all suppliers, who say there is no stock,” said her father Syed Shameel Ahmed, a retired telecom employee. Desperate search Several thalassaemia patients, who are dependent on this life-saving iron chelation injection manufactured by Novartis, are desperately running from pillar to post to get a few vials from other friends and patients. “We have been contacting the Delhi and Mumbai thalassaemia societies and NGOs in other States for help. But the situation is the same across the country for the last three weeks. We are even ready to buy the stock at MRP from some organisations that would have bought the drug in bulk but there is no response,” said Gagandeep Singh Chandok, president, Thalassaemia and Sickle Cell Society of Bengaluru. “This is a vital drug for thalassaemia patients who need daily injections to prevent iron overload from blood transfusions. The non-availability of this drug is a disaster for patients who are dependent on it. Morbidities and even fatalities can occur if the drug supply is not restored,” said Mr. Chandok, who is also dependent on the drug and needs 16 vials a week. Namitha A. Kumar, thalassaemia patient advocate from Open Platform for Orphan Diseases (OPFORD), said Desferal is a lifeline for nearly 1,500 of the 5,000 thalassaemia patients in Karnataka for whom no other iron chelation drugs work. “If Desferal is not back in stock soon we will start seeing a steep rise in comorbidities and even cardiac fatalities,” she said. “There is no information from the company on what the real issue is and when supplies will be restored. The same situation had occurred in 2016 when the company faced production issues after shifting their production unit to Brazil and supply was disrupted for over six months,” she said. Supply chain issue When contacted by The Hindu, a spokesperson for Novartis said that there have been interruptions in a few States. “Desferal injections are available in India to meet the needs of our patients. However, we have identified certain interruptions in supply in a few areas in India. We recognise the importance of this medication and are making every effort to ensure supply in the affected areas. At Novartis, we are committed to improving and extending people’s lives and are leaving no stones unturned to do so.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/shortage-of-drug-hits-thalassaemia-patients/article37675602.ece
25 November 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||ACB searches houses, offices of 15 Karnataka Govt. officials||The Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) launched simultaneous search operations at 68 locations across Karnataka targeting 15 Government officials in various departments as part of a probe into alleged disproportionate assets, on Wednesday.

25 November 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||A furore over portrait of Vallabhbhai Patel||Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D.K. Shivakumar, in an old video that surfaced on Wednesday, was seen being “persuaded” to install former Deputy Prime Minister the late Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s photograph at a function held at the Congress office to observe former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s death anniversary on October 31. In the video, shared by M.P. Renukacharya, BJP MLA, on Twitter, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah can be heard asking Mr. Shivakumar to place a portrait of Sardar Patel with Indira Gandhi “to avoid criticism by ruling BJP”. Sardar Patel’s birth anniversary too falls on October 31. Replying to Mr. Siddaramaiah, Mr. Shivakumar is heard saying, “We never keep Patel’s photograph on this day [Indira Gandhi’s death anniversary].” However, Mr. Shivakumar is later seen directing an employee in the party office to bring a photograph of Sardar Patel. This conversation was picked up by the mike of a news channel. Separate functions Addressing mediapersons later, Mr, Shivakumar explained: “We used to have separate functions for the events. We don’t want to mix death and birth anniversaries of leaders.” On criticism by the BJP, he said: “The BJP neither respects Indira Gandhi nor Sardar Patel... Please ask them what they have done on the birth anniversary of Patel or death anniversary of Indira Gandhi. We respect our freedom fighters and leaders.” This is not the only instance of conversations of politicians being inadvertently recorded and ending up in the public domain. In October, 2021, in a video that was widely shared, KPCC media coordinator M.A. Saleem and former MP V.S. Ugrappa could be heard discussing the alleged corrupt practices of Mr. Shivakumar. Back in 2017, a video that was shared widely showed former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and then Union Minister the late H.N. Ananth Kumar discussing payments made to central leaders of political parties.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/a-furore-over-portrait-of-vallabhbhai-patel/article37675600.ece
25 November 2021||CHENNAI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Proceedings to buy Jaya’s residence quashed||The Madras High Court on Wednesday quashed the proceedings initiated by the previous AIADMK government to acquire former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s bungalow, Veda Nilayam, at Poes Garden in Chennai for converting it into a memorial. It observed that India of today is not a land of pharaohs or emperors to erect monuments to immortalise the dead. Justice N. Seshasayee wrote, “India of today is not the Raj of the yesteryear for its administrators to bask in a fallacy that the wealth of the State is the wealth of the ruler. No, it is the wealth of the ruled — the People. It is time that the governments get accustomed to this constitutional reality.” He said the acquisition would serve no public purpose. He delivered the verdict while allowing the petitions filed by Jayalalithaa’s nephew J. Deepak and niece J. Deepa through their counsel S.L. Sudarsanam and K.V. Sundararajan. The judge concurred with the State that it was empowered to acquire private property for any purpose of its choice but stressed that such a purpose should be useful to the public. “This is the key. This is the test,” he said. Posing a question whether acquisition for a memorial would involve a public purpose, he said: “The answer can be a ‘Yes’ and a ‘No’. Generically it can be, but individually it need not be.” He said the need for a memorial could not be dictated by professional achievements, political populism, an image carefully groomed by cultivated charisma and electoral victories. Referring to the State having relied on a 1969 Supreme Court judgment related to a memorial for Mahatma Gandhi in Ahmedabad, he asked: “By relying upon this verdict, has not the Government acknowledged that the benchmark for establishing a memorial with public money can be justified only if the life and contribution of the person for whom the memorial is proposed approximates the life of Gandhiji and those of his ilk?” He went on to state: “In contemporary times, where there is a perceptible depreciation of ethical standards and corrosion of moral values which cumulatively leave their adverse impact on the constitutional responsibility and institutional integrity, there may not be too many leaders who may match the standards of those who gave their lives for the cause of the nation or the humankind.” He said, “In other words, if the life of a leader has only a relative value to some and not to the substantial number, then there is a risk of its becoming a memorial for a group of followers, and not the public, and may well fail in a judicial review of an alleged colourable action of the Executive.” He also took judicial note that the State had already constructed a phoenix-shaped mausoleum for Jayalalithaa at the Marina Beach by spending Rs. 80 crore in public money. “Veda Nilayam is only a few kilometres away from the phonenix memorial... What is the inspirational story that Veda Nilayam may provide which the Marina memorial does not?” the judge wondered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/proceedings-to-buy-jayalalithaas-residence-quashed/article37675737.ece
25 November 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Ensure basic facilities to flood-hit people: Jagan||Nearly one lakh people have been affected by the floods in the Rayalaseema region, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy said, while directing the administration to ensure that every family is provided basic ration. During a video conference with Collectors and officials of the flood-battered districts on Wednesday, Mr. Jagan said the loss of property should be enumerated quickly and electricity and water supply should be restored immediately. Mr. Jagan said compensation for death of livestock should be given immediately and added that cattle should be vaccinated and fodder distributed. He instructed the officials to expedite the process of payment of compensation for those whose houses were completely damaged or partially damaged within the next 3 to 4 days, and added that new houses should be sanctioned for completely damaged houses. Mr. Jagan said Rs. 95,000 should be paid as compensation for those who lost their kin, and directed the officials to sanction Rs. 1.80 lakh for constructing new house. He directed the officials to complete crop enumeration on a war-footing. He said District Collectors should submit reports on road restoration. He said temporary work should be undertaken immediately to avoid any disruption to transport. Mr. Jagan said Annamayya project should be designed to hold 2.85 lakh cusecs of water, instead of 2.17 lakh cusecs. He said the project received an inflow of 3.25 lakh cusecs of floodwater resulting in a breach. He said a report was submitted in 2017 regarding Annamayya Project to improve the quality of the dam and it was neglected by the previous government. He said the capacity of Pincha project was 58,000 cusecs while project received an inflow of 1.38 lakh cusecs of floodwater. He instructed the officials to take steps anticipating similar floods in the future and to redesign the Annamayya Project considering the current inflows. The Chief Minister instructed the officials not to lose confidence due to political criticism and to provide services to the victims. The Chief Minister directed the officials to focus on the safety of irrigation projects in 13 districts. He said the incidents like Annamayya project breach should not happen in future. He instructed the officials to be vigilant in the wake of heavy rain forecast in Nellore and Prakasam districts from November 26 for four days and make necessary preparations. The District Collectors informed the Chief Minister that they had expedited the programme of providing essential commodities to 95,949 flood-affected families, and added that providing Rs. 2,000 financial assistance to all flood affected families was almost completed.

In a video conference with Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Wednesday, the district administration, which received a flak for not gearing up for the flood situation initially, explained that the ‘unprecedented rain and heavy inflows to the water bodies’ had led to the flood situation. Days after the Annamayya and Pincha projects in Kadapa district developed a breach and the flood caused loss of life and damage of property in hundreds of acres, the district administration explained that a massive cloudburst on November 18 resulted in the floods and it was ‘unprecedented in the history of the district’. “The rainfall recorded on November 18 was unprecedented in the history of the district. There was a massive increase in inflows into the Pincha project on the Cheyyeru river. From 3,845 cusecs, the inflows increased to 90,464 cusecs by the evening of November 18. On the same day, 50 mandals in the district received a rainfall of 10.7 cm. Besides, the heavy rains in Chittor and Seshachalam hill ranges had the Cheyyeru river brimming. All the reservoirs including Annamayya, Buggavanka, Veligallu, Chitravathi, Mylavaram and Gandikota received massive inflows,” said District Collector V. Vijaya Rama Raju. The Collector said that the Pincha Dam received massive inflows of 1.17 lakh cusecs, more than the double its capacity, while Annamayya project received inflows of 2.3 lakh cusecs, resulting in breaching of bunds. The Pincha project also suffered major breaches, causing loss of lives and inundation of property.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/1250-families-evacuated-in-kadapa-collector/article37676096.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy failed to personally visit his native Kadapa district which was ravaged by the floods and confined to an aerial tour. JSP Political Affairs Committee (PAC) chairman Nadendla Manohar, who toured the submerged villages the downstream Annamayya project in Nandalur mandal on Wednesday, faulted the manner in which the administrators had ‘confined to boardroom statistics’ when the flood victims were struggling to find a shelter and food. Referring to the Cabinet ministers visiting the district in the run-up to the by-election, Mr. Manohar wondered why no Minister toured the flood-hit areas so far. “It seems Cabinet ministers tour districts during the elections only, not during such exigencies,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/administrators-confined-to-boardroom-statistics/article37676101.ece

In their ancestral villages, their prime source of livelihood options was agriculture and collecting minor forest produce, apart from their traditional occupations. On Tuesday, the evacuees shared their woes with the officials during a meeting convened by Union Ministry of Tribal Welfare Secretary Anil Kumar Jha at the Indukuru R&R Colony. The affected families from Mantooru, Enugula Gudem, and Agraharam villages have been rehabilitated in the R&R Colony.

25 November 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Anupama reunited with child||The baby boy who was given in pre-adoption foster care to a couple in Andhra Pradesh was reunited with its biological mother here on Wednesday following a court order. On a day marked by high drama, the Family Court, Thiruvananthapuram, ordered the release of the baby to its biological mother after “dropping and summarily dismissing” the adoption proceedings. Proceedings advanced  Family Court judge K. Biju Menon had advanced the proceedings in the case and passed the order by evening considering the plea of the State. The case was originally scheduled to be considered on November 30. The infant, who was brought to the chamber of the judge, was handed over to Anupama S. Chandran after her identification records were verified. The judge issued the order considering a suggestion from public prosecutor P.P. Hakkim that the child shall be handed over to its mother through the court. In its order, the judge noted that the adoption proceedings were initiated in the case on the premise that the “child was abandoned and his biological parents could not be found.”  The judge sidestepped the various allegations raised by the biological mother as he felt that those aspects were not necessary for the proceedings at hand. The court noted that the issue whether the Kerala State Council for Child Welfare, which gave the baby in foster care, has a valid licence for adoption does not “linger any more” as the council had produced a copy of the Certificate of Recognition for Adoption issued under Rule 23 (2) of the Adoption Regulations, 2017. The certificate is valid from March 12, 2019 to March 11, 2024, the court noted. Certificate cancelled Earlier, the Child Welfare Committee had recalled and cancelled the Legally Free for Adoption certificate it had issued for the baby. The “finding was arrived at on the basis of the DNA test, which confirmed that Anupama S. Chandran and B. Ajith Kumar are the biological mother and father of the child,” the court noted. N. Sunanda, chairperson of the committee, had also appeared before the court during the proceedings. The court, which had given the baby in foster care, decided to take a relook at the proceedings as the biological mother filed an application requesting that the proceedings be put on hold. The mother contended that the child, born on October 19, 2020 in her marital relationship, was entrusted to her parents for temporary custody. However, it was later found that they handed over the baby to the Kerala State for Child Welfare for adoption, the court noted. The member secretary of the State Adoption Resource Agency too had approached the court stating that a woman claiming to be the biological mother had come forward objecting to the adoption proceedings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/anupama-reunited-with-child/article37675610.ece

The State Pollution Control Board had sought advice / guidelines from the Central board for acting against violations by the municipal secretary and vendors engaged for waste removal by way of not submitting periodic reports, action plans, and data on removal and disposal of steel and concrete debris from the site. A report submitted by the board before the Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal said that non-submission of action plans by the civic body and service providers had caused difficulty in identifying sites for disposal of debris. However, the board pointed out that it was satisfied with the removal of debris from the site by service providers on the directive of the municipality. Action plans But they did not provide action plans prior to transfer of waste from the site. Though they had submitted a proposal for a sand making unit at Kumbalam for processing debris, it was given up later despite receiving the board’s consent. A portion of debris following the demolition of the Alfa Serene apartment had fallen into the nearby Vembanad lake. Local fishermen had protested against the delay in removal of debris while expressing concern about its impact on fish wealth in the region. The municipal secretary had informed the tribunal that all necessary steps had been taken to comply with the directions of the authorities concerned on the removal of demolition debris.

Sanjith on Wednesday found the scrapped parts of a car allegedly used by the assailants. The scrapped car was found from a workshop at Pollachi in Tamil Nadu. The car was suspected to have been scrapped as part of a move by the assailants to destroy evidence. The car had developed some mechanical fault while the attackers were returning after the murder. The police said the car was taken to Pollachi and scrapped in a workshop there after getting it repaired here. The assailants had used a fake number plate for the car, the police said. Meanwhile, the police arrested one more person who was suspected to have involved in the murder. He was remanded in judicial custody for two weeks. The police said he had driven the car that carried the assailants. The investigation team may move the court for his custody on Thursday.

25 November 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Private hospitals see fewer takers for COVID vaccination||Vaccine centres at private hospitals are seeing a decline in the number of persons availing themselves of paid vaccination against COVID-19 of late. As a result, many private hospitals are left with a huge number of vaccine stocks compared to the daily requirement. Many hospitals shut down vaccine centres once their stocks were fully utilised. On Wednesday, only 45 hospitals in the State administered vaccines at their respective centres while the government provided vaccination at over 2,756 centres. A total of 2.52 lakh doses were administered in the state as of 7 p.m., according to the CoWIN portal. “The number of persons seeking vaccine at our hospital has come down drastically. At present, we are administering about 20 to 30 doses per day, and we have a stock of over 500 doses,” said the representative of a hospital in Vijayawada. Another hospital in the city has been administering less than 10 doses a day and has over 100 doses in stock, according to a source. The same was the situation with many hospitals in the city and elsewhere, as demand for vaccines among the public has come down owing to increased coverage of the first dose. Across the State, over 86% of the eligible population received at least one dose of vaccine against COVID while 60% of the eligible population were fully vaccinated. With poor response to vaccine drives, the State government is reaching out to persons yet to be vaccinated by the door to door visits involving ward and village volunteers, ANMs and others. A total of 5.79 crore doses were administered, including 3.41 crore first doses and 2.38 crore second doses, so far. Meanwhile, the State’s cumulative COVID toll and tally increased to 14,430 and 20,71,831 respectively. The test positivity rate of the 3.02 crore samples tested so far at 6.85% and the daily positivity rate was below 1% for the three weeks. The number of recoveries stands at 20,55,226 with a recovery rate of 99.20%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/private-hospitals-see-fewer-takers-for-covid-vaccine/article37676082.ece
25 November 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘A.P. has overspent its NREGA fund allocation’||Andhra Pradesh has an overdraft of Rs. 2,808.7 crore in the implementation of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) in the State. Out of the original allocation of Rs. 6,271.7 crore for the current year, the Centre has released Rs. 4,571.2 crore so far but the State has already spent Rs. 7,379.9 crore. “There is no amount left for the remaining part of this fiscal (2021-22) as the allocated budget has not only been exhausted, but overspent,” said G. Naveen Kumar, a researcher from LibTech India, an organisation that analysed and prepared a report using the data available in the public domain on “MGNREGA budget vs expenditure for the current financial year”. LibTech India (Liberation Technology) is represented by a team of engineers, social workers and social scientists who work towards improving public service delivery. The period of study for the analysis of MGNREGA was from April to November 15, 2021. ‘Inadequate allocation’ Mr. Naveen Kumar said the original allocation made to the State for implementation of the programme that provides livelihood to the rural sections was grossly inadequate and got exhausted within seven months of the financial year and “we have nearly five more months to go and for the remaining months, the State does not have any money left for implementation of the programme.” The immediate question that comes to mind is how will the government meet the remaining expenditure. “If we estimate similar employment as last year during the remaining four and a half months, the State will need additional allocation of 1,782.09 crore. But if we consider providing 100 days of work as guaranteed by the Act, the government will need additional funds to the tune of Rs. 9,203.26 crore. This includes wage, material and admin expenditure,” explained Buddha Chakradhar, director, LibTech, for Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. ‘Payments doubtful’ With no money left in the State coffers, he said, workers might not receive any more employment under the scheme till March 2022. “Moreover, they will have to wait to receive the Rs. 416 crore pending wages for the works already completed,” he said, adding that the situation could be averted if the Central government allocated the required additional funds and releases them immediately. Compared to the revised allocation for last year (2020-21), which was Rs. 10,365.5 crore, there is a cut of 39.5% for the current year. The mandate of the Centrally-sponsored scheme is to provide at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. The programme continues to attract rural labourers pushed into distress due to the COVID-19 crisis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ap-has-overspent-its-nrega-fund-allocation/article37675672.ece

25 November 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Staff shortage forces AU to stop offering or modify courses||In 1932, the then Vice-Chancellor of Andhra University, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, who later went on to become the first Vice-President and the second President of the country, had inaugurated the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies in the university. The founder-Head of Department was Prof. Saileswar Sen, who had been hand-picked by Radhakrishnan. The department had produced many a stalwart such as Padma Vibhushan K. Satchidananda Murty. But today, due to lack of teachers in the department, the nine-decade-old institution that is also the biggest public university in the State, is forced to close down the department. The departments of Archaeology and Sanskrit too have been closed.This apart, many courses, or specialisation, have either be shutdown or merged into core courses, primarily because of lack of teaching staff. However, Vice-Chancellor P.V.G.D. Prasad Reddy says the departments of Philosophy and Sanskrit have been closed only for a period of one year. “We have shutdown the two departments on the campus and transferred them to the A.U. School of Distance Education (AUSDE). The number of those opting the courses has dwindled to a single digit over the years, and we do not have faculty too. This is also impacting our NIRF ranking. We will revive the two departments on the campus once we are in a position to recruit teachers,” Prof. Prasad Reddy says. He cites the same reason in respect of other courses as well. The fisheries course in the Department of Zoology has been shifted to the Marine Living Resource, as it is more relevant there. Similarly, M.Sc (Horticulture) and M.Sc (Agriculture Biotechnology) courses have been merged into M.Sc (Botany) as specialisation. “The takers for these courses too are few and there are no teachers. And, most importantly, these courses have not been recognised by many government departments. To accommodate all the students, we have increased the sections from one to two,” he says. “On the same lines, M.Sc. (Nuclear Chemistry) and M.Sc. (Physical Chemistry) have been merged into the core degrees such as M.Sc (Inorganic Chemistry) and M.Sc. (Organic Chemistry) as specialisations,” the Vice-Chancellor says. “The departments, as a result, now have more number of specialisations. Instead of having a number of courses that do not have takers and teachers, we now have core degrees with options for more specialisations,” Prof. Prasad Reddy reasons. Faculty shortage has been plaguing the university since two decades as recruitments have stopped. The university had once a permanent faculty strength of about 1,000 teachers and each department was flush with experienced professors. But, over the years, with the retirement of teachers, the strength of permanent teachers now is barely 216. “By the time this government completes its term, the strength will further drop to 60,” according to a senior professor. In this backdrop, the university has been managing with about 102 contract teachers and a few guest faculty. Recruitments have been affected because of court cases and delay on the part of the authorities concerned in the government. ‘Win-win situation’ To augment the depleting strength, the university recently inducted on deputation 113 teachers, whose services were surrendered by the aided college managements to the government. “Though there is some resentment on the campus, especially from the contract teachers, this is a win-win situation, as the university does not have to pay salaries and all are Ph.D holders with over 20 years of experience,” says Prof. Prasad Reddy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/staff-shortage-forces-au-to-stop-offering-or-modify-courses/article37675670.ece
25 November 2021||Visakhapatnam,ANDHRA PRADESH||Four ‘drunken’ persons create ruckus, ‘assault’ three persons||Four persons from the city who were reportedly in an inebriated condition created ruckus by assaulting three persons at different locations under Gopalapatnam Police Station limits here on Wednesday. According to primary investigation by the Inspector of Gopalapatnam Police Station, M. Apparao, at around 4 p.m., four persons V. Balaram (26), L. Krishna (23), D. Venkata Naveen (25), all from Arilova, and S. Shankar Rao (34) from Kurmannapalem, had reportedly consumed alcohol at a bar near Prahaladapuram and allegedly entered into a heated argument with the supervisor N. Demudu in the bar. They have also allegedly beaten him up with a beer bottle. The four then left the bar and boarded an auto-rickshaw and asked the driver Srinu to drop them at the Petrol Bunk Junction in Gopalapatnam. However, after reaching the junction, the four persons allegedly grabbed Srinu and tried to snatch his gold chain from him. Srinu escaped from their clutches and contacted the traffic constable who was standing at the junction and informed him about them. When the traffic constable was informing other police personnel through the communication sets, the accused allegedly fled from the place with the auto-rickshaw. Later they boarded an APSRTC bus and entered into an altercation with the conductor. B. Erri Naidu, who works as a constable at Maddilapalem RTC Depot, saw them at Baji Junction and started to record their activities on his mobile phone. Noticing him recording their behaviour, the four have reportedly assaulted him too. The police personnel reached Baji Junction and arrested them. “We have registered cases against them, based on the complaint from the victims. Further investigation is on,” said Mr. Apparao.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/four-drunken-persons-create-ruckus-assault-three-persons/article37676305.ece

The two-night/three-day tour will be in a Volvo multi-axle semi sleeper bus. The bus will leave from the old Central Reservation Office (CRO) of APTDC in the RTC Complex at 2 p.m. Passengers can also board the bus at NAD Junction and Gajuwaka in the city and also in Rajamahendravaram and in Vijayawada.

25 November 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||KCR on a holiday in Delhi as farmers suffer: Revanth||Telangana Congress chief Revanth Reddy has wondered why Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao was sitting in New Delhi rather than giving confidence to farmers battling with damaged and sprouted paddy due to heavy rains. ‘Secret deal’ “Is it for entering into another secret deal with the BJP government after criticising it in the air-conditioned dharna chowk,” he asked, and said that KCR’s New Delhi visit was nothing but escaping from the heat generated by the criticism of paddy farmers. The visit will yield zilch and it was more of an outing for the CM, he said. ‘Match-fixing’ In an open letter released to the media here, Mr. Reddy said that the BJP and the TRS had entered into ‘match-fixing’ using farmers as pawns. “It is astonishing that KCR is putting up a fake fight with the Centre for procurement for the next season by totally ignoring the procurement of this season. He said farmers in Telangana have brought the paddy to procurement centres a month ago and there is hardly any taker with the government least bothered to open the requisite centres. Farmers who have still stored paddy in threshing yards with procurement centres not opened are in a huge problem with the rains damaging paddy. The Congress party’s recent visit to the threshing centres across Telangana exposed the farmers’ woes and the government’s callousness. “Government should make preparations 45 days in advance but even after two months, it has failed to open even procurement centres,” he alleged. Questioning the Chief Minister on the government’s stand on buying sprouted paddy, he said it was his responsibility to procure entire damaged paddy as the delay was from the government. Claiming that KCR was ‘insincere’ on the three farm laws now withdrawn, he reminded how the TRS flip-flopped on it first supporting the Bharat Bandh against the farm laws and later arguing that they were in farmers’ interest. “Chief Minister’s dubious stand is in public memory and he can’t fool farmers trying to create a fake fight with the Centre.” In fact, KCR had officially made his government’s view crystal clear on the crops procurement saying the government was not in the business of buying and selling and it had already suffered Rs. 7,500 crore loss in it and there would be no procurement centres in the future in Telangana, Mr. Reddy claimed in the letter. Cong. support Assuring farmers that the Congress would continue to back them till the last grain was procured, he said he had personally visited the market yards and farmers in their threshing yards to understand their plight.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/kcr-on-a-holiday-in-delhi-as-farmers-suffer-revanth/article37676167.ece

Venkataramana Reddy, and P. Sudarshan Reddy. The Minister said that last time too, all the paddy produce was procured by the State government from farmers and this time also it would be done. He added that the Centre failed to give any assurance to the State government on procurement despite repeated appeals. “There is no clarity on how much quantity of fine variety and raw variety paddy would be purchased by the FCI.” He said that the State was unable to give any clarity on the next crop to be sown by farmers as the Centre itself has not given any advice. He called upon parties to join hands with TRS to pressurise the Centre to take a decision in favour of farmers. He also wanted TPCC president Revanth Reddy to stage a dharna in New Delhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/centre-humiliated-ts-by-not-giving-appointment-to-cm/article37676159.ece

Police said that the accused made as many as 17 round seals, 31 designated rubber stamps, five signature stamps of authorities which include Panchayati Raj Department, Judiciary, TSTransco, TSGenco, health, irrigation, and other departments. They approached one Khasim, who runs an employment consultancy, and asked him to share names and contact numbers of job aspirants. Khasim paid Rs. 1.10 lakh to the accused so as to get a job for his brother as a Junior Assistant in the Panchayati Raj Department. Police said that the accused cheated 23 other victims. These victims were given fake job certificates and forged appointment letters. As many as 24 fake or forged job appointment letters were given. Of these, five pertain to the fake jobs in the judiciary, and 19 are of the Panchayati Raj Department.

The procedure will cost around Rs. 25 lakh. The woman, B Surekha lost her husband B Ravi, a daily wage labourer, after he suffered a heart attack in 2017. Thereafter, she started working to provide for her three children. She makes a modest Rs. 3,000 through tailoring work. The family lives in a government-sanctioned house in Abdullapurmet, Hayatnagar. Her two other children are studying in class 9 and 10. Lokesh had to discontinue education as an attendant was needed at the school. Monthly blood transfusion and sugar level treatment of Lokesh cost Rs. 18,000. Though Ms Surekha gets Rs. 2,000 as monthly pension from the government, managing daily expenses and Lokesh’s medical care has been a challenge. Her plea for funds was earlier published in these columns in January 2020. Though she received Rs. 1.30 lakh as donation, the money has been exhausted on Lokesh’s treatment. A doctor at a city corporate hospital said that curative treatment for Lokesh is bone marrow transplantation, estimated to cost around Rs. 25 lakh. Those willing to donate money can send it to B. Surekha (Union Bank of India, Chikadpally branch, Hyderabad; bank account number: 007610100054512, IFSC: UBIN0800767) or contact her on 86867-29184.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/woman-seeks-funds-for-sons-bone-marrow-transplantation/article37676143.ece

The Kukatpally police registered a criminal case against the officer. The accused officer moved the HC which instructed the police not to take any coercive steps against him. Meanwhile, the woman got impleaded in the petition filed by the officer stating that there was no progress in the investigation by the Kukatpally police. ‘Tarnishing of image’ The lawyer appearing for the officer told the court on Wednesday that already a case was registered against the woman by the Central Crime Station of Hyderabad based on a complaint that she tarnished the image of a woman (a close relative of the accused officer) by posting objectionable content online. The officer’s counsel contended that the woman approached the Kukatpally police only to counter the case registered against her by the CCS. The judge instructed the police to present status reports in the two cases by Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hc-sets-aside-go-providing-promotions-only-to-male-officers/article37676155.ece
25 November 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||TRS corruption has surpassed Cong., TD govts: Bandi Sanjay||State BJP president and MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar on Wednesday charged the ruling TRS government saying that its ‘corruption’ has surpassed even that of the erstwhile Telugu Desam and Congress governments in united Andhra Pradesh. “Telangana people are now fed up with this corruption, family dominance and tyrannical rule. They are looking up to our party as the next alternative and this became clear going by the overwhelming response during the Praja Sangrama Yatra. We have to highlight the government’s failures and unfulfilled promises to people,” he said, addressing a training programme at the party office in the presence of senior leaders, including National OBC president K. Laxman and others. Stating that people will eventually “reject rulers with corruption and dictatorial tendencies,” he alluded to the previous governments at the Centre and State which had met this fate. “People expect that the BJP government will bring in development and serve the poor ... without indulging in corrupt practices, hence the onus is on the partymen to strengthen people’s confidence in us,” he said. The BJP is not against any community but will strongly fight against the ‘traitors’. Partymen should highlight that every section of the society are disillusioned as they have been cheated by the government, he charged. “Old City in Hyderabad has not seen any development because the Majlis party aligns itself with any party that comes to power, be it Congress, Telugu Desam or the TRS now, but does nothing. People there are more aware of this,” he said. Earlier in the day, the party’s OBC morcha held a protest outside the BC Bhavan demanding release of scholarships and funds for fee reimbursement as the pendancy has topped Rs. 3,000 crore. Students and parents are under pressure with the respective college managements demanding fee payment. When the SC/ST and minority students are getting scholarships and fee reimbursements, why is it being denied to BC children, questioned A. Bhaskar Raj, BC morcha president. With regard to loan disbursal, about 5.5 lakh are eligible as was announced in the last Assembly session but not a single penny has been sanctioned till date, he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-corruption-has-surpassed-cong-td-govts-bandi-sanjay/article37676164.ece

25 November 2021||RAJANNA-SIRCILLA,TELANGANA||Over 5k applications for settlement of claims over podu land, pattas||Around 5,940 applications were received from farmers of both tribal and non-tribal communities for settlement of long pending claims over podu (forest) land and sanction of pattas (title deeds) under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act 2006, for a little over 14,000 acres of podu land in the district. These applications were submitted by farmers from as many as 75 habitations in the forest fringe areas of 63 Gram Panchayats in eight mandals of the district during the village level meetings held earlier this month, sources said. Prior to receiving the applications, the district administration conducted meetings involving the elected representatives of the rural local bodies and other stakeholders on the provisions of the RoFR Act and the collective endeavour to protect forests. The meetings were held under the aegis of the nodal officers as part of the State government’s recent initiative to resolve issues relating to podu land and prevent encroachment of forest land across the State. Most applications were received from both tribal and non-tribal farmers mainly from Veernapalli, Garjanapalli, Adavipadira, Madimalla, and Rudrangi villages situated near the reserve forest areas in the district. Though the district has relatively less forest cover compared to tribal majority districts like Mulugu and Bhadradri-Kothagudem, it received a substantial number of 3048 applications from non-tribal farmers for grant of title deeds for podu lands, sources added. “We are awaiting guidelines from the State government to take up a field inspection to examine and settle the claims of the eligible persons in strict adherence to the provisions of the RoFR Act,” an official, who is associated with the task of receiving applications from podu farmers, told The Hindu . The exercise is expected to pick up pace soon after the December 10 biennial election to the State Legislative Council from Karimnagar Local Authorities Constituency, the official, who did not wish to be identified, said, citing model code of conduct for the ensuing MLC election, which is in force.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/over-5k-applications-for-settlement-of-claims-over-podu-land-pattas/article37676169.ece

25 November 2021||New Delhi,||Educational institutions, Govt. offices to reopen on Monday||Schools, colleges, libraries and other educational institutions in the city, which have been closed since November 13 due to high levels of air pollution, will reopen on Monday, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said on Wednesday. Truck entry ban on Government offices, which were closed, will also reopen on Monday, he said. However, the ban on entry of trucks into the city will continue till December 3. “Schools, colleges, and institutes will reopen on November 29. All Government offices will also reopen and the work-from-home directive will be lifted. But for this, it is advisable for all Government employees to use public transport to a great extent for the purpose of commuting,” Mr. Rai said. The Minister said that for the last three days, there have been improvements in Delhi’s pollution levels and the decision was taken after a review meeting on Wednesday. “Until now, trucks and other commercial vehicles, except essential service trucks, were banned from entering Delhi. But today, we have decided that starting November 27, CNG and electric trucks will be allowed to enter. Other trucks will remain banned till December 3,” he said.s Mr. Rai said that there are colonies and areas such as Nimri Colony, Gulabi Bagh, Timarpur where a majority of Delhi Government employees live and the Government has decided to start special — private CNG — buses for these people to come to work. “If we look at the average air quality index from before Deepavali, Delhi has reached those levels again. The pollution levels had been steadily rising after Deepavali. Considering that, multiple restrictions were put in place, apart from the routine processes,” the Minister said. The Minister said that so far, 1,221 construction sites have been inspected and work was stopped at 105 places due to violations of rules.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/educational-institutions-govt-offices-to-reopen-on-monday/article37676198.ece
25 November 2021||New Delhi,||While spotlight’s on Delhi, smaller northern towns often fare worse||An analysis of air quality data by The Hindu shows that Agra, Firozabad, and Vrindavan were more polluted than Delhi during the week after Deepavali. However, during this period, the media attention and actions were concentrated more on Delhi and the NCR. While Delhi was among the top 10 most polluted cities for three out of seven days, Agra, Firozabad, and Vrindavan were part of the list for four days, as per the air quality index (AQI) data of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Also, the average daily AQI of these three places is more than that of the national Capital. On some days, other non-NCR districts such as Kaithal and Kanpur made it to the top 10 list and were more polluted than Delhi. Interestingly, Delhi was never among the top five polluted cities in the country during this week. The Supreme Court ordered actions have also been mainly for the Delhi-NCR, which is monitored by the Commission for Air Quality Management  (CAQM)  in NCR and Adjoining Areas. For instance, despite the high pollution, schools were not closed or construction activities were not banned in Agra, Firozabad or Vrindavan after Deepavali, officials said. However, on November 13, these actions were taken in Delhi after the Supreme Court pulled up the State and Central Governments earlier that day. Also, Delhi and the NCR have a Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), according to which, different actions kick in as per levels of air pollution. But no such plan exists for areas beyond the NCR. Most polluted From November 5-11, the average daily AQI of Delhi was 414.8, while Vrindavan’s was 438.14, Agra’s 429.85, and Firozabad’s 437.6. On November 9, Delhi was not part of the top 10 polluted places, and there were four non-NCR districts in the top 10 and Firozabad was the most polluted place in the country. Similarly, on November 10, Agra was the most polluted place in the country. Delhi has 39 air quality monitoring stations, while Agra has six and Vrindavan and Firozabad have only one each. “It is not that we are not giving attention to these cities. These three cities are also part of the 132 cities which are covered by the NCAP (National Clean Air Programme),” a CPCB official said. About smaller cities witnessing higher pollution compared to Delhi, the official said that though meteorological conditions of Delhi and these places are similar, local factors could be behind the higher AQI. Attention needed Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director of Centre for Science and Environment, a research and advocacy NGO, said that during winter, the natural ventilation of the entire Indo Gangetic Plains (IGP), which stretches from Punjab and touches the boundaries of West Bengal, is constrained and pollutants get trapped. This is due to a drop in temperature, wind speed and the height up to which pollutants can be dispersed in the atmosphere. “A big chunk of the IGP is affected by stubble burning also. Because of these factors, several cities and sub-regions that are outside the NCR, but within the IGP, are more polluted than even Delhi during winter. But the annual average pollution of these places could be lower than Delhi,” Ms. Roychowdhury said. “Delhi gets an undue importance as initial cases on air pollution were filed about the Delhi-NCR in the Supreme Court. Because of the court orders, the region got focus,” she added. But Ms. Roychowdhury said that the Government should pay more attention to the entire IGP for pollution mitigation, as the entire region is more vulnerable to high pollution. “The NCAP is for 132 cities. The Government should implement NCAP at district and State levels and take into consideration rural areas too, instead of just focusing on cities,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/while-spotlights-on-delhi-smaller-northern-towns-often-fare-worse/article37676216.ece

He also said that for the first time, each police station will have three inspectors exclusively  to investigate crimes against women. Addressing a press conference at the Indian Women’s Press Corps office, Mr. Asthana said expeditious attention will be given if a woman or a child is in distress. “We have a crime against women cell in every police station and there is also the special unit for women and children that is working throughout the day.” The Commissioner said that the police have analysed the total rape cases recorded in Delhi this year and found out that “a friend or a family member was involved in 46% cases, neighbours were involved in 11% cases, relatives were involved in 14% cases, and other known persons, including live-in partners, were involved in 28% cases”. The police, he said, have identified the dark spots  where there is no mobile network and the areas that are vulnerable, and integrated facilitation booths will come up there. “It is an issue as sometimes there is no last-mile connectivity in some areas.” About no separate Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section to deal with the offence of snatching, Mr. Asthana said that in some States, Section 379 of the IPC, which relates to punishment for theft, has been amended. “I hope in future there is an amendment to the law which applies to Delhi too.” The farmers’ protests at the Delhi borders, he said, have been and will be allowed to continue in a democratic manner as long as law and order is maintained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/special-booths-at-dark-spots-to-prevent-crimes-against-women/article37676200.ece

The flats are those which remained unsold in the DDA’s previous housing schemes, a press note said on Wednesday. “The flats are being offered at the old rates and the cost in relaxation of the costing policy of the DDA, which is updated every financial year based on the appreciation and depreciation of land price and building as the case may be. The allottees will be eligible for subsidy under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana if they avail of home loan from a bank or a financial institution,” the statement said. Apart from this, the DDA has approved the fixation of predetermined rates for the allotment of land to transport traders. Each eligible transport trader will get a plot of 50 square metres with a floor area ratio of 250. “As per the provision of the Master Plan of Delhi 2021, godowns of transport traders in the walled city and special areas are required to be shifted to the integrated freight complex at Holambi Kalan, Narela, where booking of goods and transport agencies offices are permitted activity,” the release said. The DDA has also made provisions to expedite the process of its upcoming “in-situ” slum rehabilitation projects. “The provisions include a condition in which the slum dwellers, who are eligible for rehabilitation, will lose their right to transit accommodation if they refuse to vacate the premises which are being redeveloped. If the eligible dwellers refuse to vacate the premises even after the sanctioning of the building plan, for the areas being redeveloped, then they will not be given the alternative accommodation after the redevelopment project is completed,” a DDA official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/15000-flats-up-for-grabs-in-dda-scheme/article37676204.ece
25 November 2021||New Delhi,||Court discharges 5 accused in riots case for lack of evidence||A Delhi court has discharged five accused in a case related to vandalism during the north-east Delhi riots while noting that there was no sufficient evidence that has been presented by the police on the basis of which charges can be framed against them. Additional Sessions Judge Virender Bhat, in his order dated November 22, stated that the material on record clearly indicates that a riotous incident in question has taken place wherein the shop as well as the house of the complainant was vandalised and looted. “This court is not insensitive towards the mental agony and financial loss suffered by the complainant due to this incident. However, the sensitivity or the emotions alone are not the factors to be taken into consideration by the court while deciding the fate of any accused,” the court stated. ASJ Bhat said that there should be sufficient and legally admissible evidence on the basis of which charges can be framed against any accused and the same is lacking in the present case. “The perusal of the chargesheet does not indicate whether or not there were any efforts made by the IO (Investigating Officer) to trace any other witness. It is not clear as to whether the IO chose not to find any other witness or whether no other person who had seen the incident came forward,” the court order read. While discharging the five accused for lack of sufficient evidence, the court also directed the DCP (North-East) to conduct an inquiry into the manner in which the investigation was conducted by the IO in the case to find out whether or not there had been any deliberate attempt to shield the offenders. It asked the DCP to submit a report on the next date of hearing. According to the case records, the FIR pertains to an incident of rioting and vandalism of a medical shop on February 25 around 11.30 p.m. when a mob of around 100 people, who were armed with rods, pipes and petrol bottles, raised slogans, came towards complainant Firoz Khan’s shop in Sudamapuri and broke its shutter and the main gate and looted it. Mr. Khan was watching the incident from his roof all the while. The court stated that there was only one witness, Mr. Khan, in the whole case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/court-discharges-5-accused-in-riots-case-for-lack-of-evidence/article37676206.ece

Senior citizens of Delhi can take benefit of this scheme. Additionally, every senior citizen can take along an attendant with them on the pilgrimage. Till now, over 36,000 people have been on pilgrimage,” he also said. The ‘Mukhyamantri Tirth Yatra Yojna’ was approved by the Delhi Cabinet on January 9, 2018. The scheme provides Government assistance to the residents of Delhi, in specific persons belonging to the economically weaker section of the society. Facilities for pilgrims The scheme aims at helping the elderly go on a pilgrimage once in a lifetime.

25 November 2021||New Delhi,||HC stays summons to Vijender Gupta in defamation case||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday stayed a trial court order issuing summons to BJP MLA Vijender Gupta in a criminal defamation complaint filed by Delhi Cabinet Minister Kailash Gahlot. Justice Manoj Kumar Ohri gave the direction on Mr. Gupta’s plea challenging the summons issued to him for allegedly making defamatory statements on purported irregularities in the procurement of 1,000 low-floor buses by the Delhi Transport Corporation. The High Court will hear the case again on March 4 next year. Mr. Gupta was summoned as an accused by the trial court on October 11 on the Delhi Transport Minister’s complaint. The trial court had said there was prima facie enough evidence to summon Mr. Gupta as an accused for the alleged offence of defamation. Senior lawyer Ajay Burman, appearing for Mr. Gupta, argued that his client was covered under the exceptions to defamation under the Indian Penal Code as the statements were made in discharge of public service as a Leader of the Opposition. Senior advocate Manish Vashisht, appearing for Mr. Gahlot, stated that Mr. Gupta’s tweets were “absolutely scandalous” and made in the absence of any “conclusive finding by any judicial body”. In his complaint before the trial court, Mr. Gahlot has alleged that Mr Gupta “intentionally and for malafide purposes” defamed him and tarnished his reputation to gain political mileage. He claimed that Mr. Gupta levelled “defamatory, scandalous, mischievous, false and scurrilous allegations” verbally as well as in writing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-stays-summons-to-vijender-gupta-in-defamation-case/article37676196.ece

25 November 2021||New Delhi,||City’s air quality falls to ‘very poor’ category||The air quality in the city deteriorated to the “very poor” category on Wednesday from the “poor” level a day earlier. It is likely to remain in the same category for the next two days, according to the authorities. “Local surface winds are relatively low for the next three days, which reduce dispersion of pollutants, leading to deterioration of air quality. But air quality is likely to be within the ‘very poor’ category for the next two days,” said Government-run monitoring agency SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research) in a statement. But on Saturday, local surface winds are likely to pick up speed, resulting in improvement of air quality within the “very poor” category. SAFAR said that with the onset of winter conditions, local weather is likely to be the dominating factor in determining air quality from now. The air quality index of Delhi was 361 on Wednesday, up from 290 on Tuesday, as per the Central Pollution Control Board’s 4 p.m.bulletin, which is the average of the past 24 hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/citys-air-quality-falls-to-very-poor-category/article37676214.ece

The demonstration was led by Pradesh Morcha president Yogita Singh. “While Mr. Kejriwal is talking about giving Rs. 1,000 each month to women of Punjab and Uttarakhand, he should fulfil this in Delhi first. He had earlier talked about giving unemployment allowance to the youth but thousands of them are still waiting for that,” Ms. Singh said. “The CM, who talked about women’s safety and welfare, had promised CCTV cameras in DTC buses, but the fact is these buses are in a bad shape. If he talks about honour and respect for women, why is there not a single woman minister in his cabinet?” she asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/keep-your-promises-made-to-delhiites-first-bjp-tells-cm/article37676210.ece

Over the past few days, the price of tomatoes has reached Rs. 100 per kg in many markets of the city, with traders attributing the rise to heavy unseasonal rains across the country and a surge in fuel prices.

25 November 2021||HONG KONG,||Chinese firms eye Afghanistan’s lithium||A number of Chinese companies have already begun “on-site inspections” of possible projects to tap lithium deposits in Afghanistan, having received the green light to do so from the Taliban regime, according to a report in the Chinese state media on Wednesday. Lithium is one of many resources in Afghanistan present in large deposits but as yet untapped, largely because of years of political instability and the lack of infrastructure. A Chinese company secured the rights to mine one of the world’s biggest copper reserves in Afghanistan at Aynak more than a decade ago, but has not yet begun work on extraction. While Chinese firms are aware of the risks and pitfalls, they have not wasted time scouting out potential deposits of lithium, a valuable resource for a range of industries from electric cars to energy storage systems. A report on Wednesday in the Communist Party-run newspaper Global Times , citing Chinese businessmen, said, “Representatives of several Chinese companies have arrived in Afghanistan on special visas and are conducting on-site inspections of potential lithium projects, while others have made contacts about such projects.” The visas were obtained from Afghan authorities “after coordination between the China Arab Economic and Trade Promotion Committee in Kabul and Afghanistan’s Mining Ministry” with “representatives of five Chinese companies” arriving in early November “to conduct on-site inspections”, Yu Minghui, who heads the trade promotion committee, told the newspaper. Besides the five companies present in Afghanistan, another “at least 20” state-owned and private firms had made inquiries about lithium projects, the committee said. Mr. Yu said company representatives were “most concerned about basic guarantees of security and social order in Afghanistan”, but also “praised the Afghan Taliban’s friendliness toward Chinese investors”. The Taliban Government has said it would welcome Chinese investment and support President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative, and was also open to extending the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to Afghanistan. Security situation The security situation, not to mention a dire economic crisis including food shortages, are among the many challenges. Chinese media reported that on Saturday, a train carrying 1,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid was sent to Afghanistan from China’s western Xinjiang region. “The problem is to ensure safety,” Zhou Shijian, former vice president of the China Chamber of Commerce of Metals, Minerals and Chemicals Importers and Exporters, told the newspaper. “If safety is not guaranteed, the gain will not be worth the loss.” Last month, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with acting Deputy Prime Minister Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar in Doha, who assured Beijing that “a friendly policy towards China” was “a firm choice” by the Taliban. Mr. Wang “expressed China’s willingness to continue to provide humanitarian aid to Afghanistan within its capacity and work with the international community to help Afghanistan alleviate temporary difficulties and realise economic reconstruction as well as independent development”, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said then. Mr. Wang in September had announced China would “urgently provide 200 million yuan [$30.96 million] worth of grains, winter supplies, vaccines, and medicines to Afghanistan” as well as 3 million vaccines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/chinese-firms-eye-afghanistans-lithium/article37675527.ece
25 November 2021||COLOMBO,||Sri Lanka Cabinet clears China’s role in terminal project||Sri Lanka has decided to rope in China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) to construct the second phase of the Colombo Port’s East Container Terminal (ECT), which was earlier to be developed jointly by Sri Lanka, India and Japan, until Colombo reneged on a 2019 trilateral agreement. In a Cabinet decision taken on Tuesday, Colombo approved the development of the strategic port terminal in stages, to be “totally operated” by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. Prominent Sri Lankan firm Access Engineering and CHEC have won the bid to construct the facility, the Department of Government Information said in a statement. CHEC, a subsidiary of the state-owned China Communications Construction Company, is already involved in strategic infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka, including the $1-billion Colombo Port City coming up near Galle Face — the capital’s iconic seafront — and a four-lane elevated highway connecting Colombo’s suburbs, with a near-$1-billion investment. The terms of the highway deal allow the state-run Chinese firm to own and run the highway for 15 years before transferring ownership to Sri Lanka. With the ECT development project now, China’s role in Sri Lanka’s ports — China Merchants Port Holdings Company already holds majority stakes at the southern Hambantota Port as well as the Colombo International Container Terminal at the Colombo Port — has further increased. Limited to civil works CHEC’s role at the ECT appears limited to civil works, according to sources familiar with the tendering process. The Ministry of Port and Shipping, in its invitation for international bids, said only firms with a domestic majority ownership — over 51% of the state held by Sri Lankan nationals — were eligible to participate. The ECT’s development would require construction of an additional 700-metre-long quay wall and infrastructure around it, that was earlier estimated to cost at least $700 million. While India and Japan had earlier agreed to bring in the investment, involving India’s Adani Group, the Rajapaksa administration in February scrapped the deal signed by the former Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Government with New Delhi, citing resistance from port worker unions, and the Adani Group’s refusal to agree to the terms set by Sri Lanka. India and Japan were quick to express their displeasure. Within weeks, Sri Lanka offered the West Container Terminal development project at the same port to the Adani Group, with no known tendering process, in what Colombo called “a compromise”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/sri-lanka-cabinet-clears-chinas-role-in-terminal-project/article37675532.ece

The visit by the Crown Prince, seen as the de facto leader and the force behind the UAE’s foreign policy posture, is his first official trip to Turkey since 2012, and the highest-level visit by an Emirati official since relations hit a low. His brother who is the UAE National Security Adviser, Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, visited Turkey in August as the first step toward mending ties. The fallout between Ankara and Abu Dhabi reverberated across West Asia, resulting in a proxy conflict in Libya as well as tensions in the Gulf and in the eastern Mediterranean. Tensions also played out on social media, with jabs and taunts by officials, state-aligned accounts and Government supporters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/erdogan-hosts-uaes-crown-prince-in-attempt-to-mend-ties/article37675530.ece
25 November 2021||BERLIN,||German parties reach deal for coalition Govt.||Three German parties have reached a deal to form a new Government that will end the era of longtime Chancellor Angela Merkel, according to Olaf Scholz, who is poised to replace her. Mr. Scholz, of the centre-left Social Democrats, said he expects that members of the parties would give their blessing to the deal in the next 10 days. At a press conference, Mr. Scholz and other leaders gave some indications of how the coalition would govern. Among the first measures agreed: compulsory COVID-19 vaccinations in places where particularly vulnerable people are cared for, with the option of expanding that rule. This comes as Germany is seeing a surge in cases, and the political transition has somewhat hampered the country’s response. Mr. Scholz also stressed the importance of a sovereign Europe, friendship with France and partnership with the United States as key cornerstones of the Government’s foreign policy — continuing a long post-war tradition. The new Government would not seek “the lowest common denominator, but the politics of big impacts”, Mr. Scholz promised. The Social Democrats have been negotiating with the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats since narrowly winning a national election on September 26.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/german-parties-reach-deal-for-coalition-govt/article37675528.ece
25 November 2021||Washington,||U.S. President invites Taiwan to online meet on democracy||U.S. President Joe Biden has invited Taiwan to a virtual summit on democracy alongside more than 100 countries — a move that sparked indignation from China, which is not on the list. Taiwan thanked Mr. Biden for the invitation and said the gathering would be a rare opportunity for the self-ruled democracy to burnish its credentials on the world stage. “Through this summit, Taiwan can share its democratic success story,” Presidential Office spokesperson Xavier Chang told reporters. China said it “firmly opposed” the inclusion of an island it regards as “an inalienable part of Chinese territory”. Beijing claims self-ruled Taiwan as part of its territory to be retaken one day, by force if necessary. The global conference was a campaign pledge by the U.S. President, who has placed the struggle between democracies and “autocratic Governments” at the heart of his foreign policy. The ‘Summit for Democracy’ will take place online on December 9 and 10 ahead of an in-person meeting at its second edition next year. The meeting was long advertised, but the guest list — published Tuesday on the U.S. State Department’s website — will be closely scrutinised. The U.S.’s main rivals, China and Russia, are not on it. The invitation is a major coup for Taipei at a time when Beijing is ramping up its campaign to keep Taiwan locked out of international bodies. Only 15 countries officially recognise Taipei over Beijing, although many nations maintain de facto diplomatic relations with the island. The U.S. does not recognise Taiwan as an independent country, but it holds it up as a rare model of progressive democracy in Asia and maintains it as a crucial regional ally. It opposes any change to Taiwan’s status by force. China balks at any use of the word “Taiwan” or diplomatic gestures that might lend a sense of international legitimacy to the island. Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry said it would be represented at the summit by its de facto U.S. Ambassador Bi-khim Hsiao and Digital Minister Audery Tang, who is one of the world’s few openly transgender national politicians.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/biden-invites-taiwan-to-summit-on-democracy/article37675524.ece
25 November 2021||Stockholm,||Andersson becomes first woman Prime Minister of Sweden||Sweden’s Parliament elected Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson as the country’s first woman Prime Minister on Wednesday, hours after she clinched a last-minute deal that gave her victory by the slimmest of possible margins. The 54-year-old, who took over as leader of the Social Democrats earlier this month, reached a deal with the Left Party late on Tuesday to raise pensions in exchange for its backing in Wednesday’s vote in Parliament. She had earlier received the support of the Social Democrats’ coalition partner, the Greens, as well as the Centre Party. Despite being a nation that has long championed gender equality, Sweden has never had a woman as Prime Minister. Ms. Andersson called it “a special day”, coming 100 years after Sweden allowed female suffrage. All other Nordic countries — Norway, Denmark, Finland and Iceland — have seen women lead their Governments. However, Ms. Andersson now heads a weak minority Government whose hands will be tied on numerous issues, and she faced her first setback even before her election. The Centre Party announced that while it would not oppose Ms. Andersson in the vote for Prime Minister, it would withdraw its support for the Government’s Budget to be voted on later on Wednesday, due to the concessions made to the Left. That means Ms. Andersson will in all likelihood have to govern with a Budget presented by the Opposition conservative Moderates, Christian Democrats and far-right Sweden Democrats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/andersson-becomes-first-woman-prime-minister-of-sweden/article37675525.ece

25 November 2021||November 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Battered and bruised, repealed and withdrawn||The announcement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 19, on the withdrawal of the three farm laws and his urging “all agitating farmers to go back to their families and villages and let’s make a new beginning”, did not raise eyebrows in the country. There were compulsions, both internal and external, for the Bharatiya Janata Party to do so notwithstanding the fact that the laws were under legal scrutiny by the Supreme Court of India. The forthcoming elections to the Uttar Pradesh and Punjab Assemblies may have also been a factor in shaping the Prime Minister’s decision. A long battle After Parliament hurriedly passed the three enactments, to bring in ‘reforms’ in the agriculture sector, the volley of protests began. Swarms of farmers along with their tractors converged along the borders of Delhi marking the beginning of an over year long battle. Surprisingly, many State legislatures have passed resolutions opposing the three farm laws. When someone questioned the authority of the legislatures to pass such resolutions, it was correctly negatived by the Supreme Court. When cases were filed in the Supreme Court, it not only granted a limited stay of the implementation of the laws but also appointed an expert committee to submit a report on these pieces of legislation. The Court also raised the question whether it was proper for the protesters to continue with their agitation even when the Court was seized of the matter. Another question was also raised over how long the agitating farmers would occupy the roads and that there must be a limit for such sit-ins. The Modi Government did not wait for any verdict from the Court but took the pragmatic position to withdraw the farm laws in view of the “large-scale misconceptions” among the people. However, the farmers have indicated that they will still continue to protest until the repeal law is passed in the winter session of Parliament. In a democracy, ultimately, sovereignty vests with the people and elected Parliamentarians have only a limited brief of legislating on the subjects allotted to Parliament. On the other hand, there is nothing in the law to prevent those aggrieved from lobbying against such laws which according to them is harmful, even though, significantly, the higher courts have the power to scrutinise any law made and to determine whether they are inconsistent with the fundamental rights enshrined in Part III of the Constitution. Many a time the delay in determination also makes the aggrieved impatient by taking the matter to the streets. Plan for a capital But the announcement of the withdrawal of the farm laws was not surprising when compared to the announcement of withdrawal of the Andhra Pradesh Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Act, 2020 and the A.P. Capital Region Development Authority Repeal Act, 2020 by the Y.S.R. Congress Party (YSRCP) Government led by its Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy. After the election of his party, the YSRCP, to form the government, he decided to dismantle the only capital of Andhra Pradesh at Amaravathi; he also decided on its trifurcation: Amaravathi (legislative), Kurnool (judicial) and Visakhapatnam (executive). This new law was passed when the YSRCP won 151 seats in the 175-member Andhra Pradesh Assembly in 2019. The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) which became the first ruling party of the newly formed Andhra Pradesh State was reduced to 23 seats. N. Chandrababu Naidu who led the TDP after the bifurcation of the undivided Andhra Pradesh State into Telangana and Andhra Pradesh decided to locate the new capital at Amaravathi which is situated between Vijayawada and Guntur and inaugurated the interim secretariat there. To locate and develop the infrastructure of the capital, the TDP Government acquired an estimated 33,000 acres from farmers while also proposing to acquire another 50,000 acres, leading to large-scale protests from the farmers of the region. Notwithstanding this, the TDP Government proceeded with the construction of the capital, allotting plots to judges of the High Court for their residences. The High Court also approved the plan submitted to create judicial infrastructure for locating the new High Court and other subordinate courts at Amaravathi. The twists and turns Taking advantage of the farmers’ unrest, the successor Y.S. Jagmohan Reddy Government began a campaign to have three different capitals, even enacting a law. An inquiry into the land purchase and allotments was ordered. Controversy arose when a case was registered against a former Andhra Pradesh Advocate General and the family members of a Supreme Court judge alleging that there had been insider trading. On a petition filed by the former Advocate General, the Andhra Pradesh High Court issued a gag order on the press from reporting on the first information report filed by the Anti Corruption Bureau. The gag order was stayed by the Supreme Court of India on a petition filed by the Andhra Pradesh Government. Subsequently, several developments took place in the Andhra Pradesh High Court. Justice D.V.S.S. Somayajulu stayed the SIT probe ordered against the land scam pursuant to a decision taken by a cabinet sub-committee. There were several shocking developments subsequent to the probe being ordered against the Amaravathi land deal. A Division Bench of Justice M. Satyanarayana Murthy and Justice Lalitha Kanneganti J.J. ordered an inquiry into a telephonic conversation allegedly about a plot against the Chief Justice of Andhra Pradesh and another sitting judge of the Supreme Court. The inquiry was to be headed by a retired Supreme Court Judge, Justice R.V. Raveendran, to verify the authenticity of the conversation. It is interesting that Justice Raveendran has been appointed by the Chief Justice of India, Justice N.V. Ramana, to supervise the three-member expert committee that will go into the Pegasus snooping case. It was more shocking when a division Bench of Justices Rakesh Kumar and J. Umadevi while hearing a habeas corpus petition (on a request on behalf of the Advocate General for a short adjournment, passed an order dated October 1, 2020) which said: “On the next date, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the State may come prepared to assist the Court as to whether in the circumstances, which are prevailing in the state of Andhra Pradesh, the Court can record a finding that there is Constitutional breakdown in the State or not”. It is unheard of for a court to make a mention about bringing President’s Rule in a case between the state and an individual. It was under these circumstances that the Chief Minister, Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, wrote a letter dated October 11, 2020 to the then Chief Justice of India for an inquiry into the role of the Supreme Court judge, who, according to him, was involved in a scam. However, no such in-house enquiry was ordered. However, the letter by the Chief Minister was released to the press by the personal adviser to the Chief Minister. Things did not end with a complaint made to the highest judicial authority. The next day, the same division Bench while entertaining another case observed: “Even some occupying high positions and Constitutional posts are not restraining themselves in committing the same mistake... due to the result of [a] larger conspiracy, the CBI [Central Bureau of Investigation] is required to take appropriate action against such culprits irrespective of the post and position. It goes without saying that the CBI immediately after taking up investigation may take steps so that all the defamatory posts available on social media, i.e., private respondents, may [be] struck down and may also take steps to block such users in accordance with law.” The Chief Minister’s woes continued. The new Chief Justice of Andhra Pradesh, Prashant Kumar Mishra, and Justices Satyanarayana Murthy and Somayajulu, constituting the full Bench, held a fresh hearing of the batch of writ petitions that challenged the Andhra Pradesh Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Act, 2020 and Capital Region Development Authority Repeal Act, 2020. The Government of Andhra Pradesh filed a recusal petition asking Justices Satyanarayana Murthy and Somayajulu to withdraw from the full Bench hearing as they were admittedly recipients of a housing plot at Amaravathi allotted to them. When this issue was raised before the court, the Chief Justice presiding over the Bench refused the recusal, and when asked for an order on this issue, said that orders would be passed along with the main case. In normal course, when even allegations of apparent bias on the part of the presiding officers are raised, appropriate orders will be pronounced then and there as such matters go to the root of the issue. A ‘strategy’ Even while the arguments are in progress, the Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy Government came up with the withdrawal of the two pieces of legislation with a reservation to introduce an appropriate Bill at a later date. It is not clear whether the Government was giving in to the pressure mounted by the Opposition TDP or that it did not want to face litigation at this juncture becoming adverse. In any event, the withdrawal proposal followed from the developments the Government faced vis-à-vis the judiciary. The Government had not given up the proposed trifurcation of the capital and locating them in three regions. This may be a litigation strategy normally adopted by litigants expecting changes in the judicial spectrum. The withdrawal of the legislations by two governments has a different background but what is worrisome is the circumstances surrounding the State government’s decision that has no parallel in the judicial history of India.

25 November 2021||November 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Pointers that India is witnessing a K-shaped recovery||There has been great chatter about a V-shaped recovery for quite a while, ever since the first lockdown following the novel coronavirus pandemic. A V-shaped recovery is characterised by quick and effective recovery in measures of economic performance after an acute decline in the economy. There is undeniably some type of recovery, but one can hardly label it V-shaped. The economic ravages of the pandemic have had an uneven impact on different socio-economic groups. The recovery we see today is more K-shaped than V-shaped, with various groups and industries recovering much more rapidly than their counterparts. Signs from industry Government taxation policies continue to be regressive, with increased indirect taxes and lower direct taxes placing greater tax incidence on the destitute. The effects of this K-shaped recovery can be observed through the growth and consumption in specific industries. Two-wheelers represent the economic situation of the lower and middle-class groups and India’s small businesses. A report by analytical company CRISIL indicates that in the year 2021, two-wheeler sales are set to decline by 3%-6% year-over-year. This is on top of a lower base in the year 2020 already affected by the pandemic. The actual decline of two-wheeler sales from pre-pandemic times on account of the base effect must be much more significant. The sales of two-wheelers are the second-lowest it has been in seven years. It is imperative to note that entry-level models are the ones most affected under the category of two-wheelers. The festival season was said to rectify this phenomenon, but it had been unable to. On the other hand, premium cars and premium motorcycles have been resistant to the pandemic slowdown. Impact of taxation Moreover, the usurious taxation policy of the Government, which insists on maintaining indirect taxes on fuel and consumer products while lowering corporate taxes, paints a picture explaining these figures. The Government had recently raised taxes on textile products from 5% to 12%. While inflation soars, the incomes of the middle and lower-middle-class have at best remained constant. There is tremendous pressure on the financial stability of these households, which seemingly face a sustained loss in disposable income. Besides, the figures representing those who are employed only partially explain this phenomenon. On jobs, NREGA Over five million or 50 lakh people lost their jobs in October, according to a Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) report. Many of those who lost their jobs during this period are likely economically insecure and abstain from non-essential purchases. This, paired with the astronomically high food and fuel prices, delivers a deadly blow pushing families to poverty. Additionally, it is prudent to look at Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) figures as it acts as a proxy for the informal sector, which employs a large portion of Indians. In the year 2021-2022, the Government of India had cut its budget allocation towards MGNREGA by 34%. There is a greater demand now for MGNREGA jobs than in the pre-COVID-19 era. The lower Budget allocation accounts for the inability to compensate workers in time and fairly. A portion of the Budget this year is spent on paying the liabilities for the previous financial year. Those looking for MGNREGA work cannot afford to be unpaid for such long durations. This again ties back to placing upward pressure on unemployment figures. Stimulus and growth Therefore, there seems to be no surprise that the consumption of two-wheelers and other such products has taken a significant hit. The U.S. and European economies have stimulated the economy bottom-up through unemployment cheques and social welfare schemes. The economist, John Maynard Keynes, popularised the concept of the money multiplier and the relationship between government stimulus and economic growth. It fundamentally makes great sense to prioritise those who are more likely to spend (the middle and lower-middle-class) rather than those who have a greater propensity to save. The velocity of money which sustained a significant shock from pandemic lockdowns needs to be kickstarted. Furthermore, the inflation of asset prices over the recovery period helps determine the nature of this recovery. The recovery in the stock market and other such financial assets over the past year has been phenomenal. However, it is essential to understand that this does not necessarily reflect the economy’s condition as observed previously. Less than 5% of India invest in equities, which means that less than 5% of India directly benefited from said recovery. The lower middle class, which does not invest in such assets for many reasons, has no guard against inflation. Their only hedge against inflation is their income which makes for a poor one. Think welfare schemes Therefore, as discussed before, their financial situation is worsened due to the rising prices of essential goods. Moreover, the disproportional benefit of the asset price inflation favouring the upper-middle-class further displays the inherent K-shape of the recovery. It is crucial that the Government addresses this phenomenon and works towards aiding the middle and lower-middle class. Social welfare schemes must be given greater importance to assist households to get through this period. A seemingly viable solution is for the Government to increase progressive (direct) taxes and reduce regressive (indirect) taxes to ease the financial pressure on lower-income households.

25 November 2021||November 25 2021 00:00 IST,||A food crisis of the government’s own making||There is consensus in the scientific community that organic agriculture could reduce crop yield. Quoting three global meta-data analysis, Meemkem and Qaim (2018) pointed out that on average, the yield reduction in organic agricultural systems could be 19-25%, depending on the crop and agro-climatic region. To switch to 100% organic agriculture, a country must have robust scientific evidence and a meticulously planned methodology along with targeted actions. Otherwise, it will plunge into a food crisis, if food security cannot be achieved by other means. Organic mania In May, Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa ordered a halt to importing chemical fertilizers to turn the island nation’s agriculture sector fully organic. By that time, the Yala cropping season (May to August) had already started and farmers were using the agro-chemicals available in the market. However, no additional agro-chemicals were to be released in the market. The government stated that if there is any yield loss as a consequence of this decision, the affected farmers would be compensated for it. It is unclear how the government was planning to separate yield loss related to lack of agro-chemicals from yield loss due to natural causes, farmers’ attitudes, and so on. It is apparent now that when the Sri Lankan government took this policy decision, it had neither solid scientific information nor a clear action plan. It had taken half-baked advice from some opportunists who regularly state in public that only organic and traditional agriculture is safe to the environment and human beings. Not only did the government seem to believe that there would be little or no yield loss from agriculture that is only organic; it also seemed to think that all plant nutrients could be organically produced in the country by October 2021. If the organic agricultural production system is that simple and straightforward, why is that globally, only 1.5% of farmland is organic? Sri Lanka has been almost entirely reliant on its own rice production since the mid-2000s. Could it not have maintained this? Unsurprisingly, even when the Maha season officially started on October 15, the country was well short of the required quantities of organic fertilizers. As the most critical plant nutrient for higher yields in Sri Lanka is nitrogen (N), the authorities have estimated that for this Maha season, about 0.1 million tonnes of N is required for some major crops including paddy and tea. This is equivalent to about 15 million tonnes of compost. The country produced only around 3 million tonnes of compost by the end of August 2021. Realising that the required quantities of organic fertilizers cannot be produced within five months, the government attempted in September to import solid organic fertilizers. According to the Plant Protection Act, No. 35 of 1999, no organic substance that has harmful organisms can be imported into the country. Moreover, Sri Lanka Standards (SLSI 1704) require all imported solid organic fertilizer to be devoid of any micro-organism. A tender to supply about 0.1 million tonnes of solid organic fertilizer was offered to a Chinese fertilizer company. It was later revealed that two samples provided by this company did not pass the quality standards. This message was conveyed by the authorities to the company. However, due to reasons unknown, the first load of that solid organic fertilizer is said to have come to Sri Lankan waters and is sailing around still looking for an opportunity to reach the shores of Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, farmers started getting angry as there were no fertilizers to start cultivation. They began to protest, demanding fertilizers to be provided in all major agricultural areas and setting aside preliminary land preparation practices. They did not want to start commercial cultivation without any assurance from the government on the availability of the required fertilizers. Then, the government was advised to purchase a liquid nano-N fertilizer from the Indian Farmer Fertilizer Corporative Limited (IFFCO), which, some said, is organic and 100% efficient. However, according to the IFFCO website, this liquid fertilizer is actually nano-urea and hence cannot be used in organic agriculture as it is chemical in nature. Given the urgency of the situation, the government ordered 3.1 million litres of nano-urea, which has only 4% N, from IFFCO. The first quantity was air-lifted into Sri Lanka and distributed as Nano-Raja among paddy farmers. Farmers were advised to apply 2.5 L of Nano-Raja as a foliar spray. Scientists are sceptical about the efficacy of this fertilizer as there has been heavy rainfall in Sri Lanka over the last few weeks. Nonetheless, even in India, there is limited large-scale evidence on the effectiveness of this product. Not much is known about the health concerns that might arise on long-term exposure to nano-particles. Moreover, 2.5 L of Nano-Raja provides only 100g of N when at least 50kg of N is needed for the paddy crop. The farmers will at most get an additional 5-10kg of N through locally available compost. The quality of these composts, mostly produced using municipal solid wastes, cannot be guaranteed either, as there is no quality control mechanism in place. Crop decline Now, even over a month after the season started, only about 25-40% of farmers have started paddy cultivation in Sri Lanka. The distributed quantities of N fertilizers have not been adequate to achieve the expected yield target of the farmers (4-6 tonnes per hectare). Therefore, reduction in national paddy production is an inevitability. The same would be true for other crop sectors as well. Therefore, the government must do something within a very short period of time to provide sufficient quantities of N fertilizer, at least to paddy farmers and tea-growers. Failure to do so will reduce foreign exchange earnings from tea, increase food prices, create food shortage and lead to food imports. The government will have to import food from other countries — food that is produced using agro-chemicals because of the higher price of organic food. This would be ironical as food without agro-chemicals was one of the major policy objectives of the ban on the import of agro-chemicals. The overarching policy document of the government titled ‘Vistas of Prosperity and Splendor’ promises to provide the nation with safe food and food security. However, the ill-advised policy of banning agro-chemicals, which was based on inadequate scientific evidence and false belief, hit the Sri Lankan agriculture and plantation crop sectors like a cyclone. With a crippling economy thanks to COVID-19, this was uncalled for. On November 24, the Sri Lankan government announced that it would partially lift the ban on chemical fertilizers and permit the private sector to import these fertilizers. However, considerable damage has already been done, with farmers claiming that their crop production has declined, food prices rising, and a food crisis looming. R.S.

25 November 2021||November 25 2021 00:00 IST,||A unified regulatory framework||It is evident that the success of Internet firms and telcos goes hand in hand. However, the ownership of approximately 18% of Jio by Facebook and Google provides a hint that new dynamics are on the horizon — with the evolution of 5G technologies, we are seeing the growth of an integrated sphere of cooperation as well as competition between telcos and Internet companies on account of substitute services, and competition in complementary value networks. Asymmetric regulatory stance The growth in over-the-top (OTT) messaging services provided by Internet firms has been accompanied by significant reductions in the revenues of text messaging services provided by telcos. For instance, the quarterly SMS volume in the U.K. has declined by half to 10 billion by 2021 in the past five years. Similarly, the growth of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services offered by OTT service providers is also a threat to telcos. Complementary value networks or ‘Walled Gardens’ comprise a bouquet of services provided by network operators, handset manufacturers, platform vendors, and content providers. An example is the one created by Apple with exclusive wholesale agreements with AT&T Wireless in the early 2000s for its iPhones. By subsidising the iPhone with long tenure contractual agreements, and creating a proprietary app store, Apple created a walled garden. Recently in India, RJio has forged arrangements with Google for JioPhone Next to create an ecosystem of handsets, connectivity and applications. These walled gardens often have a “platform captain” (i.e. Apple, RJio) which provides coordinating mechanisms, rules, key products, intellectual property and financial capital. Platform captains generally derive business benefit from their pole position. Hence, members of a walled garden may aspire for the position of captain. This brings a new element of competition into the telcos-Internet companies’ relationship. Despite the fact that services can be substituted and despite increasing competitive pressures within walled gardens, there is an asymmetric regulatory stance with respect to telcos and Internet companies. Some of this stems from fundamental differences in the nature of business such as the jurisdictional nature of operation and technology used. However, the asymmetry partly reflects a certain world view with regard to the regulation of competition across telcos and Internet firms. Net neutrality regulation An example is net neutrality regulation. When net neutrality was conceptualised in the early 2000s, it was meant to stem the significant market power of telcos, which provide an essential service. A dominant telco can hinder competition in a downstream market by a vertical merger with content and application providers. Net neutrality regulation that prohibits discriminatory treatment of Internet companies — either with respect to pricing or traffic management — in a sense eliminates any incentive for vertical integration. Net neutrality regulation can also be explained as a way of preventing telcos from extracting all their revenues from Internet companies. This possibility arises because such firms have no choice but to make themselves available via all telecom service providers. On the other hand, subscribers restrict themselves to one service provider. However, over the past decade, the Internet has evolved to a point where many Internet companies also provide an essential service and enjoy significant market power. For instance, web search, a market dominated by Google, is often the starting point for navigating the World Wide Web. Without search neutrality, search results may be manipulated to favour certain firms. This concern becomes heightened in the presence of vertical integration between the search engine company and downstream companies. Hence, net neutrality principles need to be applied to Internet companies as well. Beyond net neutrality, just as it is mandatory for telcos to provide “equal access” for interconnecting with other telcos’ networks, social media networks, instant messengers, and indeed any Internet service that exhibits critical mass dynamics needs to be governed by interconnection regulation. In sum, there is an element of competition between telcos and Internet companies in the context of overlapping services and walled gardens. Hence, there is a need for a measure of regulatory parity between the two. In the U.S. and in India, while the sector regulator makes rules for telcos, the competition regulator oversees the behaviour of the Internet firms. It is time for a unified regulatory framework. A semblance of this convergence is visible in the European Union. India too needs an integrated perspective. Rohit Prasad and V.

25 November 2021||November 25 2021 00:00 IST,||POCSO shocker||The recent Allahabad High Court verdict that a penetrative sexual assault on a 10-year-old boy by an offender did not amount to an aggravated form of the crime appears to be per incuriam , that is, a ruling handed down without due regard to the law and facts. The offence that was proven in the trial, and endorsed without demur by the High Court, involved the child being made to perform an oral sexual act. The Court agrees that it was a “penetrative sexual assault” as defined by the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, as the accused had put his member into the victim’s mouth. However, it did not amount to “aggravated penetrative sexual assault”, a crime punishable with a minimum prison term of 10 years that can go up to life, Justice Anil Kumar Ojha has said. Instead, it was punishable under Section 4 of POCSO, which prescribes a minimum seven years. Accordingly, he reduced the trial court sentence of 10 years in jail to seven years. The High Court is palpably in error, as it failed to note that a sexual offence takes the character of an aggravated form of the same offence in certain circumstances under POCSO. The main circumstances involving aggravation given in Section 5 are where the offender is a police officer, a member of the armed forces, a public servant or someone on the staff of a jail, remand home, hospital, educational or religious institution, or any place of custody or care and protection. However, these are not the only circumstances. Where the crime involves a group of offenders, or is done repeatedly, or when it pertains to the use of deadly weapons or causes grievous harm or injury, or leads to physical or mental incapacitation, pregnancy, or disease, it is also an aggravated form of the offence. Significantly, Section 5(m) adds “whoever commits penetrative sexual assault on a child below 12 years” to this list. The High Court seems to have missed either this legal provision while reducing the sentence, or the fact that the child was about 10 years old when the offence took place. The fact that the convicted person will stay in jail for seven years will not obviate the deleterious effect of the ruling — that a particular act, amounting to a penetrative sexual act, does not attract the punishment prescribed for its aggravated form — will have on lower courts trying similar cases. It is a matter of coincidence that this ruling came from the Allahabad High Court on the same day as the Supreme Court’s judgment underscoring the importance of not diluting the gravity of an offence against a child by ignoring the plain meaning of POCSO’s provisions. The verdict in Sonu Kushwaha vs State of U.P. is a fit case for review, as it seems to be based on an error of law.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/pocso-shocker/article37675493.ece
25 November 2021||November 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Virus rages in Europe||With the staggering increase in daily fresh coronavirus cases and deaths in much of Europe, the continent has for the second time since last March, become the pandemic epicentre. The resurgence in daily new cases which began in early October and restricted to three countries has since spread and is driven by the Delta variant. The continent reported nearly two million new cases last week, the highest since the pandemic began; more than half of the global COVID-19 deaths this month were in Europe. In Austria, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, and Norway, the daily cases are the highest since the pandemic began; Romania and Ukraine reported record high numbers a few weeks ago. With hospitals fast filling up, WHO predicts that there would be extreme stress on hospital beds and intensive care units in many European countries between now and March next year. While the vaccination rates in most countries in western Europe are higher — Ireland leads the table with over 90% adults being fully vaccinated in early September — the vaccination levels are relatively lower in eastern Europe. With France setting an example, many countries are now making it difficult for the unvaccinated to freely travel or enter certain public or even workplaces, in an attempt to increase vaccine uptake. And in a first, Austria made vaccination mandatory starting February next year and went into a national lockdown for three weeks from November 22. Austria has managed to fully vaccinate about 65% of its eligible population, which is one of the lowest rates in western Europe. While most of the new daily cases reported are among the unvaccinated, breakthrough infections and hospitalisations are being reported in the fully vaccinated too. However, the deaths have predominantly been among the unvaccinated. Even while WHO has called for a moratorium on booster doses till this year-end so vaccines become available to developing countries, its Europe office has endorsed administering booster doses as a “priority” to the most vulnerable populations — based on growing evidence of a decline in protection against infection and mild disease among the fully vaccinated. As evidence has shown, vaccines alone will be insufficient to break the transmission chain. Unfortunately, most western countries focused primarily on increasing vaccination coverage while foregoing simple yet highly effective non-pharmaceutical interventions such as universal mask wearing, physical distancing and improved ventilation in confined spaces. A study, which is yet to be peer-reviewed, predicts 0.9 million more hospitalisations and 0.3 million additional deaths in 19 European countries where people have been neither infected nor vaccinated. WHO predicts 0.7 million more deaths by March 2022 in Europe and central Asia. Compliance with public health measures can indeed avoid needless infections and deaths.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/virus-rages-in-europe/article37675494.ece
25 November 2021||November 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Task cut out for Congress in Kerala||Some members of the Congress’s old guard in Kerala are up in arms against the ongoing reorganisation of the party in the State. The drubbing the party received in the Assembly elections this year forced a leadership change which did not go down well with senior leaders such as former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy and former Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, Ramesh Chennithala. The new Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president, K. Sudhakaran, and the Leader of the Opposition, V.D. Satheesan, came under fire from leader V.M. Sudheeran for not consulting veteran leaders ‘adequately’ while finalising the list of district Congress presidents. During this turbulence, disciplinary action was initiated against leaders who made disparaging public statements against the selection. Reorganisation efforts When the party went to the polls, its weaknesses included its unwieldy, top-heavy structure. The shake-up saw a nearly 500-member State Committee give way to a ‘manageable’ 56-member body. The new leadership is now gearing up to select district committee members — not more than 51 in bigger districts and up to 31 in smaller ones — by mid-December. That the KPCC reshuffle has almost rendered the 21-member political affairs committee (PAC) appointed by the All-India Congress Committee in 2016 redundant or relegated it to an advisory role has riled senior leaders who want the PAC to be in the saddle. That, however, would be counterproductive given that there could be run-ins with the new State committee. To rebuild the party at the grassroots, the Congress is now mobilising unit committees below the booth level. The plan is to have at least one lakh such committees. A structured programme to train volunteers is already being implemented at various levels, with the thrust on “the organisational history, secular tradition and democratic outlook”. Also on the cards is a ‘political school’, to be set up first in Thiruvananthapuram, to strengthen the ideological base and political vision of leaders. Winning back support The Congress’s commitment to secularism was called into question when the party proposed to bring legislation criminalising women’s entry into Sabarimala. A rethink in the party about that campaign is apparent considering the Congress’s refusal to fall for a similar communally charged propaganda by the BJP against restaurants serving ‘halal’ food and citing ‘halal’ markings on a few parcels of jaggery purchased by Sabarimala temple authorities in 2019 to prepare aravana prasadam. Another big task for the party’s State leadership is to win back the communities that have drifted away. It was the rising prominence of the Muslim League in the 2011 Chandy government that created bad blood within the Congress-led UDF and gave heartburn to the strongest faction of the Kerala Congress, influential among the Catholic Christians. With the Kerala Congress (Mani) now aligned with the Left and sections of the church trying to curry favour with the BJP, it is an uphill task for the Congress to regain the trust of large sections of Christian voters. Meanwhile, the most vexing question is whether the organisational reshuffle is just another desultory exercise considering that the organisational elections are set to take place in a year or so. Detractors of the reshuffle point to the ongoing membership drive, slated to end on March 31, 2022, if not extended. There would be a freeze on nomination of party officials once the drive is over and elections are declared. Should the party wait until then to set its house in order is a million-dollar question. The present reorganisation process may offer no silver bullet, but it can give the party a sense of direction. anandan.s@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/task-cut-out-for-congress-in-kerala/article37675522.ece
25 November 2021||November 25 2021 00:00 IST,||U.S. feels Pindi charge exaggerated||Washington, Nov. 24: On the basis of reports from its own Intelligence channels the U.S. is understood to have concluded that regular units of the Indian Army have moved into East Bengal during the last 48 hours. Official sources here admit that Pakistani allegations that a full-scale attack by 12 or more Indian divisions is a gross exaggeration. Their estimate rather is that two or three Indian brigades have moved into East Bengal in Jesore sector to support a Mukti Bahini offensive. These officials are therefore not accepting Indian denials of absolute non-involvement in the fighting that has flared up in East Bengal. The U.S. assessment therefore is that while the present situation is far short of war, the prospect of such a conflict is now much nearer. Washington is therefore watching the situation to see how it develops before adopting any particular course of action. This is evident from the fact that neither the State Department nor the White House has until now called in either the Indian or Pakistani envoys here to express their concern — calls to the two countries to cool have so far only emanated from press spokesmen of the U.S. Government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/us-feels-pindi-charge-exaggerated/article37675508.ece
25 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Survey suggests 71% have low or no trust in cryptocurrency’||About 71% Indians have low or zero trust in cryptocurrencies, according to a recent survey by LocalCircles. The survey added that 54% do not want the government to legalise cryptocurrencies but want them taxed on par with digital assets held abroad. The community social network said the survey results were based on 56,000 citizen responses from 342 districts of India, received over the past 15 days. The Centre plans to introduce a Bill to regulate cryptocurrency and ban all private cryptocurrencies in the winter session of Parliament that begins on November 29. The bill also seeks to create a facilitative framework for creation of an official digital currency to be issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). As per the survey, families of 87% of the respondents do not have anyone trading or investing in cryptocurrencies and 54% do not want the government to legalise cryptocurrencies but tax them like a digital asset held abroad. “About 26% say they should be legalised and then taxed in India,” LocalCircles said in a release. “The study also finds that 51% of the respondents support India rolling out its own digital currency which is managed by the RBI while 26% are against the same. This indicates that the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) would be a more trustworthy investment,” it added. “LocalCircles will be sharing the findings of this study with the senior leadership of Government of India, the RBI leadership and all Members of Parliament such that public feedback on cryptocurrencies can be given the due consideration as laws related to it are finalised,” said Sachin Taparia, founder, LocalCircles.  The findings show that the Central Bank Digital Currency is seen as more trustworthy||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/survey-suggests-71-have-low-or-no-trust-in-cryptocurrency/article37675477.ece
25 November 2021||New delhi,||‘Airports to attract Rs. 90,000 cr. in investments over five years’||The airports sector is expected to see an investment of Rs. 90,000 crore in a five-year period, with almost Rs. 68,000 crore coming from the private players, a senior official said on Wednesday. The civil aviation sector, which was battered by the COVID-19 pandemic that had also resulted in the suspension of domestic and international flight services, is slowly on the recovery path and the daily domestic air traffic is nearing the pre-COVID level of 4 lakh. Civil Aviation Secretary Rajiv Bansal said investments totalling Rs. 90,000 crore would be made for airports over the five-year period which started in 2020-21. ‘Private sector to invest’ Of the total amount, about Rs. 20,000-Rs. 22,000 crore would be invested by the Airports Authority of India (AAI), while the remaining amount of about Rs. 68,000 crore would be from the private sector, he said. The government expects to have 220 operational airports, including heliports over five years. Currently, there are 136 operational airports in the country, and many aerodromes are in the works. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone for the new airport at Jewar in Uttar Pradesh on Thursday. A new airport at Mopa in Goa is expected to be ready next year, and an aerodrome is also coming up at Navi Mumbai in Maharashtra. Besides, expansion work has been taken up at the airports in Delhi, Bangalore and Hyderabad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/airports-to-attract-rs-90000-cr-in-investments-over-five-years/article37675481.ece

Krishna Kumar, VP and centre head at Music Tribe India. “The India team will strengthen Music Tribe’s software capabilities around embedded software, cloud and digital technologies including AI, ML and edge computing,” he added. Music Tribe also has audio-visual product manufacturing facilities in China, Malaysia and Thailand and is likely to set up a manufacturing facility in India as well at a later point. Music Tribe designs and sells a wide range of audio-visual products including mixers, synthesizers, amplifiers, signal processors, microphones, hi-fi speakers and headphones. Other than products under the Behringer brand, the company also owns brands such as Midas, Klark Teknik, Lab Gruppen, Tannoy, Aston Microphones, TC Electronic and TC Helicon.

While concerns over inflation, especially in the Wholesale Price Index, needed to be addressed, measures other than reversal of the accommodative stance should be encouraged, it added. “The RBI and its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) have done a commendable job to retain the present policy rates. However, central banks in some of the developed economies are moving towards tapering the accommodative policies. “We are sure and as we have been maintaining that the RBI would not follow this template and continue with the low interest rates,” the industry body said in a statement. “Any reversal of the accommodative interest rate stance may dampen faster revival in investment,” Assocham added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/rbi-must-aid-growth-by-staying-accommodative/article37675483.ece

25 November 2021||Paris,||United & Chelsea make the knockouts||Energised by a change of manager and another opportunistic finish by Cristiano Ronaldo, Manchester United qualified for the knockout stage of the Champions League with a game to spare. United was led for the first time by Michael Carrick following the weekend firing of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and, just like his predecessor, the interim manager was thankful for a goal by the Champions League’s record scorer. Lobbed finish Ronaldo produced a sublime lobbed finish to put United ahead against Villarreal on Tuesday and a 90th-minute strike by Jadon Sancho sealed a 2-0 win to secure progress as the winner of Group F. Another English team, defending champion Chelsea, also advanced on the back of a 4-0 win over already-qualified Juventus. Chelsea and Juventus are tied on 12 points with a game left to play. Barcelona, now coached by former star midfielder Xavi Hernandez, has advanced from its group every season for almost two decades but a 0-0 draw at home to Benfica means the Spanish club might need to beat Bayern Munich in the final round of games to advance. If Barca fails to beat Bayern away, Benfica could overtake the Spanish club with a win at home to already-eliminated Dynamo Kyiv. If they finish tied on points, Benfica would advance courtesy of their head-to-head record.  The results: Group E: Dynamo Kiev 1 (Garmash 70) lost to Bayern Munich 2 (Lewandowski 14, Coman 42); Barcelona 0 drew with Benfica 0.   Group F: Villarreal 0 lost to Manchester United 2 (Ronaldo 78, Sancho 90); Young Boys 3 (Siebatcheu 39, Sierro 80, Hefti 84) drew with Atalanta 3 (Zapata 10, Palomino 51, Muriel 88).

Group H: Chelsea 4 (Chalobah 25, James 56, Hudson-Odoi 58, Werner 90+5) bt Juventus 0; Malmo 1 (Rieks 28) lost to Zenit Saint Petersburg 1 (Rakitsky 90+2-pen) .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/united-chelsea-make-the-knockouts/article37675686.ece
25 November 2021||KANPUR,||Spinners hold the key as India begins its Test journey under Dravid||With a new coach, a stand-in captain and another home series waiting to be won, a depleted India still looks ready to whip out a familiar result as the first Test gets underway here from Thursday. Moreover, given the conditions at the Green Park Stadium here and spin-resources in the squad, coach Rahul Dravid may not be required to bring in much of his cricketing acumen to stump the opposition on his “Test debut”. Leading the squad which is without some of the regulars, Ajinkya Rahane is confident he has the ammunition needed to take out New Zealand, the reigning World Test champion. Pitch looks dry Although not a rank-turner, the pitch here appears dry and good enough for the spin trio of R. Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel to get into the act early. In short, the longevity of this Test depends entirely on how New Zealand bats. Last time a Test was played here, involving these teams in 2016, Ashwin took 10 wickets and Man-of-the-Match Jadeja six, to go with his unbeaten 50. The match did go into the fifth day, which India won by 197 runs. For the first Test to be competitive, skipper Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor will have to show the way to play spin. The duo, after playing an important part in the World Test Championship final at Lord’s, will be keen to repeat the dose to the Indian spinners, despite the occasion and the conditions being vastly different here.  A similar sentiment runs in the Indian dressing room, too. Having blanked New Zealand in the three-match T20I series after losing the key World T20 league match to the Kiwis, the host is raring to inflict a 2-0 whitewash in Tests to avenge the loss suffered in the WTC final. Looking to do one better than last time in the on-going WTC, India has no reason to provide batter-friendly pitches in the series. Similarly, New Zealand is not known to alter its home advantages in any format. After all, India and New Zealand thrive in home conditions. In the past 10 seasons, if one considers only the decisive Tests played in these countries, New Zealand won 43 out of 48 and India 47 from 51. Given that spinners will call the shots, it remains to be seen which two new-ball bowlers among Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Siraj, Umesh Yadav and Prasidh Krishna will be considered. The absence of K.L. Rahul means Shubman Gill and Mayank Agarwal will open, and Shreyas Iyer makes his Test debut. Regulars like Ajinkya, Cheteshwar Pujara and comeback-man Wriddhiman Saha, along with the five bowlers, complete the playing XI. New Zealand not only faces concerns regarding playing quality spinners on these pitches, but also how its slower bowlers bowl to the Indian batters. Left-arm spinners Mitchell Santner and Ajaz Patel appear certainties along with pacemen Tim Southee and Kyle Jamieson. Four-Test old off-spinner William Somerville could well be the third spin option.  The teams (from):   India: Ajinkya Rahane (Captain), Cheteshwar Pujara (vice-captain), Mayank Agarwal, Shubman Gill, Shreyas Iyer, Suryakumar Yadav, Wriddhiman Saha (wk), K.S. Bharat (wk), Ravindra Jadeja, R. Ashwin, Axar Patel, Jayant Yadav, Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Mohammed Siraj and Prasidh Krishna.   New Zealand: Kane Williamson (Captain), Tom Blundell (wk), Tom Latham, Ross Taylor, Daryl Mitchell, Henry Nicholls, Ajaz Patel, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Mitchell Santner, William Somerville, Tim Southee, Will Young, Neil Wagner and Kyle Jamieson.   Match starts at 9.30 a.m .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/spinners-hold-the-key-as-india-begins-its-test-journey-under-dravid/article37675622.ece
25 November 2021||Chennai,||Sai Sudharsan — a vital contributor||B. Sai Sudharsan might not have topped the run charts for Tamil Nadu in the Syed Mushtaq Ali tournament, but a look behind the headline numbers will show the vital contributions he has made in the team’s success. In his first two matches, his knocks gave the TN innings the momentum with a 19-ball 35 on debut against Maharashtra followed by a 25-ball 33 against Odisha. In the quarterfinal, chasing 182 against Kerala, it was his 31-ball 46 that set the path for TN to chase down the total before he made an unbeaten 34 (31) to knock off a small target of 90 against Hyderabad in the semifinals.  Sudharsan, like many youngsters, missed a crucial one year due to the pandemic after he was selected for the under-19 zonal camp in the NCA that was eventually cancelled last year. But the 20-year-old, speaking to The Hindu , said it proved to be a blessing. “I was upset initially the camp got cancelled because it was my last year in U-19. But I used the break to work hard on my skills and fitness to be ready when cricket resumed,” said Sudharsan. It showed when he topped the TNPL run charts with 358 runs for Lyca Kovai Kings. He followed it up with 494 runs in the V.A. Parthasarathy Memorial trophy one-dayers in seven matches to help his side Jolly Rovers win the title. On his experience of playing for TN, Sudharsan said, “The team management made me feel like I belonged here and told me where I would bat and what my role is. Their backing helped me play with freedom without fear of getting out.” The elegant left-hander termed his 46 as the best knock of the tournament and said he had learnt a lot from being with players who have played IPL and for India. Work in progress On the areas he feels he can improve, Sudharsan added, “I got starts but in future, I want to play the full quota of overs and finish off games. Another area I want to improve is how to improve my plans and game awareness.” Quote from M. Venkatramana: He did not look like he was a debutant and showed very good maturity for a 20-year-old. The most impressive aspect was his work ethic and off-the-field, he works more than is even required.  He did not look like he was a debutant and showed very good maturity for a 20-year-old.

25 November 2021||November 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Javi on a high, sinks BFC||A splendid double from Javi Hernandez and a fine individual effort from Aridai Suarez handed Odisha FC a 3-1 victory over Bengaluru FC in its Indian Super League opener at the Tilak Maidan Stadium in Goa on Wednesday. That Hernandez’s goals had their origins in completely avoidable mistakes from BFC shouldn’t take anything away from the execution; the first was a delightful long-range chip over the entire defence and the second a swerving free-kick from just outside the penalty area. At 1-2, BFC skipper Sunil Chhetri could have brought his side back and equalled Ferran Corominas’ all-time ISL goal tally (48), but his penalty in the 61st minute was saved. Substitute Cleiton Silva, who earned the spot-kick, bundled in the rebound, only for the referee to disallow the goal. Replays showed that the Brazilian had encroached the penalty box before the kick was taken. But the same replay also showed an Odisha player encroaching, which should have resulted in the penalty being retaken. Regardless, BFC was clearly below par. The evening was off to the worst possible start when a botched clearance by Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, following a miscommunication with his defenders in the third minute, was beautifully chipped into the goal by Hernandez. Marco Pezzaiuoli’s outfit equalised in the 21st minute with Alan Costa towering over Nandhakumar Sekar to turn in a fine corner from Roshan Naorem. Hernandez’s second was through a brilliant free kick to the top-right corner, but that came after a blunder from Udanta Singh. The winger misplaced a pass, and in an attempt to make amends, ended up fouling Jonathas Cristian. In the 90th minute, Silva saw a powerful shot from close range saved by Odisha goalie Kamaljit Singh. Soon enough, Suarez turned Pratik Chowdhary inside out and bundled the ball in to put the result to bed.  The result: Odisha FC 3 (Hernandez 3, 51, Suarez 90) bt with Bengaluru FC 1 (Costa 21).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/javi-on-a-high-sinks-bfc/article37675616.ece
25 November 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Determined France ambushes India||A well-oiled France outsmarted defending champion India 5-4 in a Pool B match to cause the biggest upset on the opening day of the Junior men's hockey World Cup at the Kalinga Stadium here on Wednesday. The lack of cohesion was apparent as the host was outplayed by France in every department. France, which finished a surprise runner-up in New Delhi in 2013, stunned the defending champion by scoring in the opening minute through captain Timothee Clement’s field goal. India’s shock doubled when the pacy French side went 2-0 up in the seventh minute. The trio of Mathis Clement, Jules Verrier and Benjamin Marque finished off a well-coordinated move, reflecting France's excellent preparation. India managed to pull one back as Uttam Singh slotted home a rebound off the team’s first penalty corner. Sanjay's drag-flick drew parity before the first break. The second quarter belonged to France. Clement's crisp drag-flick off the first long corner put his side in the lead again. The Frenchmen, who dominated the proceedings, earned three successive penalty corners after half-time. Clement went on to complete a hat-trick in the 32nd minute. France pulled away further through Corentin Sellier's field goal in the final quarter. Though Sanjay struck twice in the closing minutes and performed the three-peat, it wasn’t enough to deny France.  The results:   Pool A: Belgium 5 (Roman Duvekot 7 & 45, Nelson Onana 24, Arno van Dessel 55, Rik van Cleynenbreugel 58) bt South Africa 1 (Jacques van Tonder 15+); Malaysia 2 (Kamarulzaman Kamaruddin 34. Syarman Mat 43) bt Chile 1 (Sebastian Wolansky 59).   Pool B: Poland 1 (Eryk Bembenek 34) bt Canada 0; France 5 (Timothee Clement 1, 23 & 32, Benjamin Marque 7, Corentin Sellier 48) bt India 4 (Uttam Singh 10, Sanjay 15+, 57 & 58).   Pool D: Germany 5 (Michel Struthoff 1. Robert Duckscheer 14 & 54, Maximilian Siegburg 19, Benedikt Schwarzhaupt 22) bt Pakistan 2 (Abdul Shahid 18, Muhammed Hammadudin 49).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/determined-france-ambushes-india/article37675621.ece

25 November 2021||Galle,||Mendis puts Lanka on the brink of victory||Sri Lanka needs just four wickets to win the first Test against West Indies in Galle after setting the all-but-impossible target of 348 on Wednesday’s penultimate day of play. West Indies had made just 52 before bad light forced an early end after the hosts’ spin trio made quick work of the top order. The sensational collapse saw the tourists lose four wickets in 15 balls for just four runs. Ramesh Mendis was the pick of the bowlers finishing with four for 17. The off-spinner had the makings of a hat-trick as he trapped Kyle Mayers leg before. Lasith Embuldeniya accounted for Jermaine Blackwood and Roston Chase. There was little hope for West Indies at 18 for six and all signs were that the game was going to end on the fourth day. Then Nkrumah Bonner (18) and da Silva (15) batted for just over 45 minutes to hang in before the umpires called bad light. Sri Lanka declared its second innings on 191 for four after a 123-run stand by Angelo Mathews and Dimuth Karunaratne in just 150 deliveries. Skipper Karunaratne, who had posted 147 in the first innings, narrowly missed twin centuries with 83, including nine fours. West Indies was 230 all out in the first innings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mendis-spins-a-web-around-wi-batters-sri-lanka-on-the-brink-of-victory/article37675619.ece
25 November 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Junior WC—A platform to mould youngsters into individuals||Apart from providing a global platform to the participating nations to groom their youngsters, the men’s hockey Junior World Cup here offers the countries an opportunity to expose their players to varied cultures from around the world and help them grow as individuals. For Belgium coach Jeroen Baart, a player’s overall growth is important. “It is a fantastic opportunity for the boys to play different cultures and different nations, so (the objectives are to) grow inside the tournament, grow as players, grow as individuals and get the best out of them, which hopefully will give them a shot to join the Red Lions (senior Belgium team),” said Belgium coach Jeroen Baart. “Living and working in surroundings like this gives them the flavour to go further in life.” Similar views Netherlands’ coach Michiel van der Struijk had similar views. “It’s very good for the players’ experience to play other cultures. It’s also good for their education so that they can finally join the national men’s team. It’s important that we learn a lot here,” said van der Struijk. German coach Valentin Altenburg also underlined the importance of the young players’ wholesome development. “I believe every minute on the pitch in the next couple of weeks will make my team a better team. Getting to know this fascinating Indian culture will let my players grow as people of the world,” said Altenburg. Pakistan coach Danish Kaleem wanted his boys to learn as much as possible. “Not only will they play hockey but they will learn from watching these 16 nations,” said Kaleem.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/junior-wca-platform-to-mould-youngsters-into-individuals/article37676054.ece

25 November 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||‘Asian Games is Mirabai’s main target’||National weightlifting coach Vijay Sharma said winning a medal in the 2022 Asian Games would be the main target for Olympic silver medallist Mirabai Chanu. Sharma has decided not to field Mirabai in the upcoming World championships in Tashkent from December 7 to 17. “We are working on Mira’s snatch technique. We are trying to rectify a technical fault. You need time for that. I cannot see the kind of performance she needs to produce to compete at the World championships,” said Sharma on Wednesday. “Since we are working on the technique, there is no question of how much she does in snatch. In clean and jerk, she has not gone past 100-105kg. We are not taking load in jerk. If you don’t prepare the body for taking the load and rush, then there is a chance of picking up an injury.” Sharma said the Asian Games, where Mirabai would face strong competition from the Chinese lifters, would be the main challenge for the 27-year-old. “When we are qualifying (for the Commonwealth Games) on the basis of her No.1 ranking, then there is no need to go to the World championships (which is also a qualifying event for the 2022 Commonwealth Games). We have a (CWG qualifying) competition (in Singapore) in February, we need to test ourselves there. “Even if she does not do anything special, she will win the CWG gold. But the main target is the Asian Games. We have sufficient time to train for the Asiad, which is very close to the CWG. If we achieve the peak too early, then it will be difficult to maintain that performance for a long period of time,” said Sharma.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/asian-games-is-mirabais-main-target/article37675841.ece
25 November 2021||ANANTAPUR:,||Residential Football Academy for girls inaugurated||Anantapur District Collector S.

RDT’s Women Empowerment Director Vishala Ferrer, District Sports Development Officer P. Sai Krishna were among those present.

25 November 2021||Coimbatore,||Good response for U-19 championship||The Tamil Nadu Badminton Association (TNBA) has finally managed to get the much-needed break to conduct the under-19 championship here. “Our players lost about two years of their valuable time due to the pandemic. As organisers from TNBA, we had to conduct tournaments. Luckily, we got the break in January and conducted a few age-group championships. We completed most of them except the under-19,” said TNBA secretary V.E. Arunachallam. Time flies But surprisingly, time flew quickly for TNBA. “COVID-19 restrictions and various other disturbances failed to get us going. We are pleased that it is finally happening now. We are extremely proud and happy about the Coimbatore Badminton Association (CBA) being so supportive despite the many unforeseen circumstances,” he said. The players and parents were not happy with the championship getting delayed time and again as it affected their travel plans. Despite that, it has attracted about 600-plus entries. “It is phenomenal for an under-19 event. This is the first time that we have such a big crowd for this age-group championship,” added Arunachallam. Biggest bench strength He said the under-19 players are TN’s biggest bench strength at the national level. “We need to give the best facility to them and, we are pleased to host it at the RaK’s Sports Arena. It has good standard courts and the facilities are world class. We hope to see bigger tournaments happening here and looking forward to a better year ahead.” CBA secretary Swetha Krishnamurthy said: “It’s a good initiative by TNBA to promote its coaches and players and it has given rise to an exciting talent pool, who are making their mark in national and international tournaments.” The championship, inaugurated on Wednesday, had all safety protocols in place. “Only one coach and parent is allowed inside and there’s no entry for spectators. We have even split the practice sessions district-wise to avoid overcrowding,” said S. Mutharasu, its president.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/good-response-for-u-19-championship/article37675817.ece
25 November 2021||HYDERABAD,||Live in the present doing the little things right — Milind’s mantra||For Hyderabad left-arm pacer Chama Milind, who was the highest wicket-taker in the recent Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy T20 cricket championship with 18 scalps, the guiding principles for better success rate were to forget the past, not think too much about the future and live in the present doing the little things right. And, he is now focussed on improving that performance in the Vijay Hazare Trophy one-day championship in Mohali next month. The 27-year-old Milind, who has been one of the frontline pacers in the Hyderabad Ranji team for eight years now, said he had pressured himself for a couple of years to go to the next level. “And after the high in 2016 Ranji season claiming 35 wickets, I had an injury break the next season. Those were really testing times. But, thanks to the support of my parents, support staff in the HCA including my coach T. Dilip and my teammates, I could come back strong,” he recalled. “Now, I feel I am better off in using the crease, angle and importantly on getting the right field for different batters. “I am obviously more attentive to these simple but very effective things in the art of bowling,” Milind said. “There are no set targets; I would like to keep improving with each match. There is no end, as they say, to learning. But I would like to contribute to the team’s cause as much as possible,” he said. Milind was all praise for new coach Milap Mewada. “There is so much positivity the way he talks with the players even when the chips are down. He doesn’t put pressure of any kind on you. He has been just brilliant and has been a confidence booster. There is a unique and welcome bond among teammates now,” he said. Milind, who played for India in the U-19 World Cup back in 2014, is clearly determined to be consistent at the highest level to look ahead and realise the dream of playing for India seniors one day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/live-in-the-present-doing-the-little-things-right-milinds-mantra/article37676218.ece
25 November 2021||November 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Tougher than the opener: Vukomanovic||Despite the 2-4 loss against ATK Mohun Bagan in the opener, Kerala Blasters’ head coach Ivan Vukomanovic is not an anxious man. The Blasters take on NorthEast United in the Indian Super League at Fatorda on Thursday and the Serbian sees it as a new opportunity. “In football, the nice thing is that we have the next opportunity to play a new game,” said Vukomanovic on Wednesday. Khalid Jamil’s NorthEast, a semifinalist last season, also opened with a 2-4 defeat against Bengaluru FC but Vukomanovic feels the match will be a lot tougher than the opener. “I think tomorrow’s game will be harder. Every game is different, every game is hard. It depends on how you start, how you approach, we like to be more focused on ourselves, to control the game and try to make the game easier for ourselves,” said the Serbian. “And we want to play attacking football.” The Blasters will be without K.P. Rahul, the winger who provided a nice assist to Samad Abdul Sahal for the team’s opening goal, who suffered an injury in the opener. Meanwhile Alison Kharsyntiew, the NorthEast assistant coach, said he looked at the Blasters with a lot of respect. “They are a very good side, with a good coach and good players. We have to prepare very well, go with a strong mentality and do our best in every department to get the three points. But it will be a tough match,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kerala-blasters-will-hope-to-bounce-back/article37675967.ece

We played here in 2016 but things have changed a little bit.” These words from skipper Kane Williamson give a peek into the mindset of the New Zealand batters against the potent threat of the Indian spinners — R. Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Jayant Yadav — in the series. “The guys have been trying to prepare as well as they can and looking forward to the challenge,” Williamson said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/we-know-the-challenge-is-big-says-williamson/article37675623.ece
25 November 2021||KANPU,||Shreyas set to make Test debut, confirms Rahane||Finally, the wait is over for Shreyas Iyer. The Mumbai player will make his Test debut against New Zealand here on Thursday. First added to the Test squad in March 2017 as cover for Virat Kohli on the eve of the fourth Test against Australia, Shreyas went on to make his ODI debut (against New Zealand) and T20I debut (against Sri Lanka) later that year. As a result, after 22 ODIs and 32 T20Is, Shreyas gets to play Test cricket. Having made a mark with some tall scores, consistently in the domestic seasons, Shreyas averages 52.18 in First Class cricket (4592 runs in 54 matches). Interestingly, in his last First Class match, Shreyas played for Rest of India against Vidarbha in the Irani Cup tie in February 2019. Confirming the Test debut for Shreyas, stand-in skipper Ajinkya Rahane did not rule out another debutant in Thursday’s playing XI. This leaves a ray of hope for his Mumbai teammate Surya Kumar Yadav. Rahane described the absence of K.L. Rahul was a “big blow” and continued, “He did really well in England. Obviously, we will miss him. But, we have guys who can do that job (of an opener).” Like Cheteshwar Pujara on Tuesday, Rahane, too, chose to downplay his inconsistency in getting big scores since that match-winning century in Melbourne earlier this year. “My job is to contribute for the team and contribution doesn’t mean you score a hundred every game.

25 November 2021||GURUGRAM,||Manish gets the better of Sekulic||Manish Sureshkumar got his act right and beat the finalist of the last two events, Philip Sekulic of Australia, 6-3, 7-6(5) in the first round of the $15,000 ITF men’s tennis tournament at the Tennis Project on Wednesday. The 22-year-old overcame moments of uncertainty to haul himself past the talented Sekulic, whom he had beaten for the title in the final in Indore. Sekulic engaged in verbal volleys with his father right through the match and lacked the mental energy to fight his way past trouble this day. Thus, he was unable to drive home the advantage when leading 5-3, 30-0 in the second set. In another match, Karan Singh continued to hold sway over two-time national champion Niki Poonacha as he beat the second seed 6-2, 6-3. Poonacha has been troubled by back pain and could not stand up to the barrage of winners that the 18-year-old Karan unleashed. Having negotiated three rounds of the qualifying event, Karan was sharp with his game. He had beaten Poonacha in the first round in Indore. Ishaque Eqbal converted his sixth match point to beat seventh seed Rishab Agarwal 7-6(4), 6-3. Top seed Sidharth Rawat played close to his best to dismiss the challenge from the young Dev Javia in straight sets. Eighth seed S.D. Prajwal Dev overcame a tricky start to beat Romain Faucon of Belgium in three sets. In the pre-quarterfinals, he will play Nitin Kumar Sinha who also overcame a slow start to beat Bharath Kumaran.

25 November 2021||November 25 2021 00:00 IST,||As far as the eye can see||Chennai has enough nooks and crannies that spin their own tales even for the native. Here are monuments, museums and memorials to explore. Pack a picnic hamper, and discover Madras nalla Madras . Day 1  9am  Leave at the crack of dawn for the Dutch Fort, Sadras, near Kalpakkam. In the surreal monsoon light, the fort looks like a fading snapshot of colonial India. A gate with spikes, guarded by cannon stands at the entrance of this ASI monument with carved tombstones of Dutch sailors buried between 1620 and 1769. A warren of tunnels with clean sand, and dining and dancing halls leads to the moss-lined steps — you glimpse the Bay of Bengal from where the British bombed this fort and captured it in 1854.  11.30 am  Back in Chennai, make a detour to Taramani, a hub of education with institutes such as the Roja Muthiah Research Library. This is a treasure house of material on the humanities and social sciences, compiled over 200 years. The private collection of Roja Muthiah, once a signboard artist who fell in love with old books, the library has some of the finest Tamil books, the oldest published in 1804.  12.30 pm  Drive past the Classical-style DGP’s office, University Senate and War Memorial to arrive at Fort St George. This is where modern India was founded when the Fort was completed in 1644 and from where the Union Jack unfurled across Asia.City historian Sriram V suggests you spend two hours to explore 24 significant points in the fort. St Mary’s, the oldest Anglican church East of the Suez with its grand pipe organ plays host to the Armistice service every second Sunday of November to honour World War veterans. Built in 1795 the Fort Museum is disabled-friendly, its louvered windows open to coins, portraits and offbeat stories such as Captain Philip Anstruther’s cage in which he was held captive with his knees hammered. Also, wander through King’s Barracks, Clive’s house and the Duke of Wellington’s house.  2.30pm  The Madras High Court complex was completed by Henry Irwin in 1892. The Indo-Saracenic structure is home to two of the city’s early lighthouses, one a Doric column of Pallavaram granite, the other atop the main building visible 32 miles out at sea. The turrets, hang high above the city’s smog and were what many first saw of Madras when they came in by masula boats. It also survived two World Wars. A gallery lined with Minton tiles and portraits leads to a court-room where the accused made their appearance through a trap door set in the floor. Other intriguing cases and prized law documents are at the High Court Museum.  3.30pm  Wander pastArmenian Church, into Mannadi, chock-a-block with migrants for nearly 200 years. The air is thick with Telugu, Marwari and Gujarati. Drive to Royapuram, once the haunt of Anglo-Indians, remembered now only in the names scratched out on the worn-out flagstones of Bishop Corrie’s. Further, The Communicable Diseases Hospital stands on the site of emigration depots that were holding spaces for indentured labour who set sail to places as far afield as Fiji to fund the Raj. The steps to Maadi Poonga are shaded by bougainvillea. Here lies the northern boundary wall built in 1772 of the once walled city of Madras. Day 2  9am  Swing the car down Poonamallee High Road taking in the sights of Madras Medical College, Central Station, Siddique Sarai, Victoria Hall and Ripon Building, Government College of Fine Arts, St Andrews Kirk and Egmore Railway Station to the Police Museum on Pantheon Road. The red-brick colonnaded Government Museum, Chennai has the largest collection of Roman antiquities outside of Europe. Sujatha Shankar, convenor, INTACH, Chennai chapter, recommends seeing The Bronze Gallery and the Amaravathi sculptures.It was also here that the idea for the city’s first zoo was thought of by Orientalist Edward Balfour.  2pm  It is full steam ahead to the RailMuseum, its parks filled with engines and carriages of iconic trains such as the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway. The galleries are filled with miniatures that take you back to the hiss of hot steam and the sharp toot of the brass whistle when the train snakes around a bend. There are also pictures of the Swiss engineers who lent the Integral Coach Factory the first technology, and luminaries such as Leonid Brezhnev and Queen Elizabeth II who have visited the ICF. Don’t miss the old world charm of cutlery from that Indian classic — the Railway Waiting Room.  4pm  At the Madras War Cemetery whereheadstones commemorate men and women who died in both World Wars pause at the austere Stone of Remembrance with the words ‘Their Name Liveth For Evermore’, chosen by Rudyard Kipling to venerate the dead of the Empire. Then, as the long drawn-out twilight of the East falls on the city, drive up St Thomas Mount. On one side is the church, on the other, a birds-eye view of Chennai caught in a sweep of dusk.

25 November 2021||November 25 2021 00:00 IST,||The way back||Silambarasan aka Simbu’s career hit a pause when whispers about his unprofessionalism came to surface after AAA in 2017. As the whispers grew louder, with some producers even asking for compensation for losses incurred, Simbu felt he had hit rock bottom. The accusations and name-calling accumulated so much that Simbu says he did not know how to manage or even come out of the pitfall that he created. The journey turned out to be a long-term project than a quick fix. In an industry where issues related to mental health are either brushed aside or lack sensitivity, Simbu is a rare Tamil cinema star who has been vocal about what he went through. Starting out as a child actor in his father T Rajendar’s films, Simbu admits that it was a low-point in his long career that only caused damage. He describes that phase as his “lockdown”, quite literally. “I didn’t feel like coming out of the house and interacting with people. In spite of all that, I was acting and was trying to socialise with people,” says Simbu, dressed in an olive green V-neck T-shirt, during a press interaction ahead of the Venkat Prabhu-directed Maanaadu releasing today. The actor turned to spirituality to come out of that place. “Now that I am finally out, I believe my potential will reflect in my work.” The realisation of having swam his way through was what happened recently when Simbu become emotional at the audio launch of Maanaadu . He made a dramatic statement, addressing his fans and well-wishers: “I will take care of my problems, you take care of me.” Simbu says he tried controlling his pent-up emotions, but he could not. “Even for this film [ Maanaadu ], there were a lot of problems from the start. We started shooting and then it was dropped, and we started again. The film, my weight loss journey and the pandemic — all of this affected me when I went on stage,” he says. Set against a political backdrop,  Maanaadu (Campaign) is about the concept of time loop, where the characters are trapped in a series of events that repeat themselves. But Simbu clarifies that the film is not overly political. Nor is he worried if audiences would understand such a high-concept. In fact, what drew him towards Maanaadu was how simplified the concept has been presented by its director, Venkat Prabhu. “It is about a normal guy getting caught in this time loop [like Edge of Tomorrow and Source Code ]. Though the scenes repeat, you will see something new. That is what Venkat Prabhu has done, in a commercial way.” For Simbu, it was as much a journey of self-discovery as it was spiritual. In due course, he says he learnt a lesson or two; and how he has evolved as an actor-person. Which is why Simbu says he will not do a film like Vallavan in today’s times. “I was a boy then and hence acted in such commercial films. I have come out of that zone now. Cinema too has changed. Audiences are watching all sorts of content and they are no longer liking the cinema thanam ,” he says, adding, “We need to cater to what today’s audiences want. For that, you will have to work with directors who are doing that.” Simbu has been talking to young filmmakers, although nothing has been finalised yet. In the next one year, he wishes to stay committed to his acting projects. “I like the zone I am in right now...it’s peaceful. I need this space for me.”  I was a boy when I did films likeVallavan. I have come out of that zone now. We need to cater to what today’s audiences want Simbu   Spiritual Journey Simbu went through a drastic physical transformation last year, losing nearly 27 kilos. Lockdowns are when Simbu got the breathing time to schedule his day. “In the past, I have put on and lost weight for my character [like in Silambattam ]. But once you hit 30, your body doesn’t listen to you,” he says. Simbu switched to liquid diet, in addition to a fitness regimen that included working out and playing sports such as tennis, cricket and basketball. “My body couldn’t take it for the first two weeks and I struggled a lot. But that is something you should overcome.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-way-back/article37675429.ece
25 November 2021||November 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Lean, clean killing machine||There comes a point in life where you feel you hit stagnation; where the pause is perpetual, sometimes even questioning yourself if you have lost the sense of objectivity. It is only natural for an artist or any creative person for that matter to elbow their way through the odds stacked against them. Somewhere around 2016, Abhishek Bachchan realised he was not satisfied with the kind of work he was doing, although some of his films during that interval were successful. He was brave to take a pause when he realised he had “slipped into his comfort zone” and came back with Manmarziyaan in 2018, in which his performance as Robbie was highly appreciated. Having been in the business of acting for 21 years, Abhishek says he wanted to recalibrate and come back and do the work that excited him. “As an actor, you cannot always be in your comfort zone. Sometimes you have to push your limits and if needed, stick your neck out,” he says. It is only fair to say that Abhishek has loosened up as an actor with some interesting choices: Ludo , Breathe: Into the Shadows and The Big Bull . He is now in the spin-off Bob Biswas , based on an assassin character from the Hindi thriller Kahaani , directed by Sujoy Ghosh. He is also acting in the Hindi remake of Tamil experimental Oththa Seruppu Size 7 . There is a slight excitement in his voice at the mention of whether we are witnessing Abhishek 2.0 where he is reinventing his career. “Not exactly reinventing but enjoying myself doing the work I like. Thankfully, I am also getting the work I personally want to do,” he says, ahead of of Bob Biswas , releasing on Zee5 on December 3. What did you think of Kahaani and Saswata Chatterjee’s performance as the original Bob Biswas?  I hadn’t seen Kahaani when I started shooting this film. I only ended up seeing the film during the lockdown for the first time. By that time we had almost finished most of the shoot. To have such a great impact in such a short time is testimony enough. It is a wonderful character, wonderfully written and performed. Spin-off as a concept is still relatively new in Indian cinema. What were your thoughts when Diya came to you with this idea about making a standalone film? I had signed on the film before I read the script. It was an emotional decision to make. But the kind of person I am, I tend to put relationships ahead of the professional game. Sujoy [Ghosh] is a very dear friend and when I got to know that Diya [Annapurna Ghosh] was making the film, it was obviously a ‘yes’. I was thankful and relieved when I heard the script because it was a great script and a great role. We never really discussed whether spin offs work. The focus was on making a good film. You seemed to have killed the physicality of Bob Biswas. Was there a point during the course of the making where you felt you cracked the mental side of the character as well?  It is kind of immaterial what I think. It is what the audiences think that matters in the end. As actors you have to be 100% convinced about what you are doing. I don’t know any actor who is not completely prepared before they go to a film. Be it physically or mentally, you have to be completely prepared as we were. But as I said, it is immaterial what we think. The film also seems to deal with the moral dilemmas that Bob Biswas faces. As an actor, do you have such dilemmas when you play characters that are morally-flawed?  Yes, I do. Of late, my entire thought process has changed. I decided not to do a film which my family couldn’t sit down and watch — but that is a personal choice. I do believe that I have certain moral responsibilities when it comes to work. Part of being an actor is the fun of getting to live lives you will not live personally. There is that fun aspect of it but I do understand the responsibility I have. But this is my personal belief.  Bob Biswas is written by Sujoy, and directed by Diya. To whom does the film belong?  I would say it belongs to Bob Biswas and me ( laughs ).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/lean-clean-killing-machine/article37675437.ece
25 November 2021||November 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Call of the waterfall||Tired of being cooped up at home? It might be another week till the rains dissipate, but until then, let us take solace in keeping our winter escapades planned, booked and ready. While the usual sun-soaked beaches await weekenders to Chennai’s South, to the West are places that have not seen the full flow of tourism in a while. Yelagiri’s waterfalls and campsites are eagerly awaiting visitors, so why not map out a 48-hour drive that lets us cover as much natural beauty as possible? Not all the wonders on route — hidden or otherwise — are natural. In 2013, the small, pre-historic stone structures inside Moolakkadu Reserve Forest on Jawadu Hills were made accessible to tourists. The drive along NH32, enroute Yelagiri, takes a little less than five hours if you start early, making it the perfect brunch pitstop with a post-meal hike to boot. The site is described fondly by Rajith Cherian, a Chennai-based offroad biker: “The distance from base is not much, but it’s an hour-long trek, since the trail isn’t well-paved or well-explored.” He went during the dry season and says “Everything was brown but the view was still beautiful. After the monsoon, things will be more lush and green.” It can get tricky after rains, though, so trek cautiously.  The Vaaliyamparai Dolmens stand atop a short yet precarious trail. They are small, single-chamber structures, theorised to be ancient stone tombs known as dolmens, and can be accessed only via a guided trek in the presence of members from a self help group set up just for this purpose. Your effort will be rewarded not only by the curious structures on top, but also by a stunning view of the hills all around. At a distance of about 30 kilometres from the dolmens await the Beeman Waterfalls, that are gushing after weeks of being fed by heavy rainfall. These falls are the first among a string of waterfalls. This particular stretch of Jawadu Hills, dotted with multiple waterfalls, is worth visiting, but the remaining ones in our list are still a few kilometres away. What is closer — about 13 kilometres or a half-hour drive away — is the Vainu Bappu Observatory at Indian Institute of Astrophysics, near the hilly village of Kavalur. In any other year, the observatory would have boasted three impressive telescopes — including Asia’s largest, the Vainu Bappu Telescope — and made for an interesting pitstop for Nature enthusiasts and stargazers. However, the visitor programme was suspended earlier this year due to COVID-19. So, unless you want to visit three more waterfalls in the same evening, covering another 45-odd kilometres, how about spending the evening stargazing by a campfire, next to your cosy tent? Since Jawadu Hills are not as commercialised or touristy as Yelagiri, there are few options for accomodation nearby. However, Gogocamping near Kavalur offers tents and equipment upon pre-booking. The surroundings are simple, but the skies will be starry and the sites are used to catering to the needs of Chennai travellers. Gogocamping, for instance, offers free private parking as well as a vegetarian breakfast, so you are well-fuelled for day two of your sojourn. The next morning, a 40-kilometre drive will lead you to Mayilparai, the first of a string of waterfalls in that stretch of the Eastern Ghats. After a day of exploring and enjoying the Mayilparai and Jalagamparai falls, make sure you begin your drive back to Chennai by noon, since it will take you about six hours. Unless, of course, you want to spend another night under the stars, at a campsite closer down your route. The YMCA Camp Centre in Yelagiri is open for visitors, and offers three-people tents as well as other equipment to be used within its star-capped camping site. YMCA sometimes hosts stargazing camps, conducted by SPACE Chennai, but those have been put on hold till January. Until then, there are plenty of mountain drives and waterfalls to enjoy. And if you want one last pitstop, drop by Amirthi Zoological Park, 25 kilometres South of Vellore, to say hello to the pelicans and deer on your way home to Chennai.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/call-of-the-waterfall/article37675468.ece
25 November 2021||November 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Making of a MasterChef||In this remote bylane of Thillai Nagar in Tiruchi, a banner congratulating Devaki Vijayaraman for winning the title in the first season of MasterChef India — Tamil works better than Google Maps in helping us locate the low-profile victor’s home. But Devaki blushes when we mention it to her. “My husband and school friends put it up, even though I was not for it. Participating inMasterChef Tamiland winning the inaugural season feels like a dream to me; I haven’t woken up yet!” laughs Devaki. Prepping, as every chef is fond of saying, is everything when it comes to the culinary world. But for Devaki, preparation has been often overtaken by her passion to try new things. Despite being interested in cookery from an early age, Devaki was not encouraged to make it a profession by her family. “So I graduated in Commerce, and then did my MBA, and worked in an IT company for a few years. After marriage, my husband and I were based in Chennai, but we decided to return to Tiruchi when we were expecting our first child,” says the 28-year-old. Lockdown bakes A few months after her son Dhruv was born, Devaki attended a baking course, and started posting pictures of her cakes on her WhatsApp and Instagram accounts. “I set up a baking and icing station in my drawing room just so that I could get the perfect product.” What started out as a hobby became a business idea during lockdown. With commercial bakeries downing shutters last year, Devaki found herself flooded with orders from friends and neighbours. As her venture took off, so did her dreams. “I am an ardent fan of cookery shows on TV; when I watched [Singaporean] Sasi Cheliah win the MasterChef Australia title in 2018, I became passionate about contesting in the show,” says Devaki. “But it wasn’t about winning anything, I would have been happy just to qualify or get an apron at the most,” she says. Filmed in Bengaluru and telecast by Sun TV, MasterChef India - Tamil was hosted by actor Vijay Sethupathi. Professional chefs Harish Rao, Aarthi Sampath and Koushik S were the judges. There is no doubt Devaki has achieved far more than what she had initially hoped for: besides winning the title and trophy, she has also got the coveted MasterChef gold-trimmed coat, and a cash prize of Rs. 25 lakh. After clearing two audition rounds in Madurai, Devaki was among the 12 shortlisted contestants who headed to Bengaluru, where a further 12 people joined the competition. She was one among the 14 finalists who eventually progressed to the advanced stages of the show. Interacting with the charismatic host was a major highlight. “Vijay Sethupathi is so down-to-earth; when we were waiting for the chefs to evaluate our work with knots in our stomachs, he would ease the tension with light-hearted banter,” she recalls. By contrast, she says, the judges were strict. “We could talk only about the food we had cooked, and listen to their technical assessment of our skills.” Twist of taste Devaki presented recipes that capitalised on a continental flavour with a southern Indian twist. Whether arancini (fried Italian rice balls stuffed with cheese) made with karuvepillai sadam (curry leaf rice), or dianthus poothrekelu , a floral take on the papery Andhra rice batter dessert served up with white chocolate, her yen for fusion cuisine stood out. “I felt that I had finally reached some level of expertise when judge Harish Rao took a selfie with me after I presented the dianthus poothrekelu , because I had tried a complicated technique with the available materials in the studio, replacing an earthen pot with a dosa tawa ,” she says. In the finale, Mayajalam, an iced lemon cream quennelle with a paruthi paal (cottonseed extract) mousse filling won over the judges, with its sweet and tart flavours. “Though it was a Tamil programme, MasterChef is also about food from other cultures. I tried to do my best with what we have here in South India, mixed with international tastes,” she says. Devaki hopes to secure a portion of her prize money for her son’s future, and also expand her bakery business. “Winning the MasterChef India - Tamil title has given me a new identity and self-confidence. My customers in Tiruchi have been very supportive and proud to have bought a cake from the season’s winner,” she laughs. “Their trust and love are the best prize.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/making-of-a-masterchef/article37675473.ece
25 November 2021||November 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Wanted: India’s master brewer||Many people have spent half the lockdown playing barista, sitting at home. Some have even tested their gradually growing skills with different roasts, pitted themselves against different devices and played with experimental brewing styles. But have you ever wondered how good you really are, outside of your home kitchen and friends circle? As the Indian Aeropress Championship comes to Chennai, non-professional coffee brewers finally have a chance to pit their prowess against others in the city and the country — and the world, if they are good enough. Originally a brand known for sports equipment, the name AeroPress in 2005 became synonymous with the coffee making device, AeroPress, developed in the US and introduced to the market by the same firm. Today, AeroPress is among the popular home-brewing methods for coffee lovers around the world. In December, Chennai will be one of 13 cities and regions to choose three talented amateur brewers for a final, national-level showdown, from which will be selected the Indian representative for the World Aeropress Championships to be held in Australia in 2022. The Indian leg of the contest is put together by the country’s growing fraternity of independent coffee roasters, planters and experts. In Chennai, the venue is being provided by Divya Jayashankar, founder of Beachville Coffee Roasters, and the raw ingredients by Akshay Vaidyanathan, founder of Kaapi Kottai. Judges are Auroville-based independent coffee pioneer Marc Tormo, and Viggnesh V who documents the country’s growing coffee industry on his Instagram page Roast Brew and You. Says Divya, “The Chennai round will be held on December 5 at 11am. The idea is that the people who brew with an Aeropress will be given one coffee, uniform across all contestants, and will have to use it in a way they like, to create a concoction that they prefer. They will be given 10 days to test and brew at home with the same coffee, and figure out what works best in their opinion — what their brew ratio is, what water temperature they prefer.” Registrations close around November 25, after which organisers will ship the coffee — 250 grams of whole bean — out to participants. “Typically, most contestants will have a grinder at home and can fine-tune the grind according to their preference. Participants may also come over on the day of the event, and take a couple of tries getting the grind right on our in-shop grinder,” adds Divya. The team behind the Indian leg of contests is Bengaluru-based Benki Brewing Tools , whose founder Suhas Dwarkanath has been organising coordinating with roasters, planters and others in the fraternity, to conduct regional rounds since 2017. “We started very small, with 38 contestants in total across the Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore rounds. When we last did it in 2019, before the pandemic, we were the second biggest competition in the world, with 221 participants in five cities. Spain was the biggest,” says Suhas over a phone call, between flying from city to city with each round. The scope of the contest in India has grown as steadily as the fraternity itself. Most major cities now have a community eager to experiment with bean to bar coffee. Each city chapter is supported by a different roastery sponsoring the venue, and startup sponsoring the coffee, be it Roastery Coffee House that hosts the Hyderabad and Kolkata contests, or original bean to bar brand Blue Tokai, which provided beans for Delhi. “There is no minimum requirement for the number of participants in a city,” says Suhas, “As long as a roastery can provide 650 square feet space, enough tables and electricity, and basic equipment including a grinder, they can host a round.”   For details and registration,   visit www.indianaeropress championship.com   The goal is to select India’s representative for World Aeropress Championships in Australia in 2022||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/wanted-indias-master-brewer/article37675432.ece
25 November 2021||November 25 2021 00:00 IST,||For the record||Over a Zoom call on a rainy day in Chennai, I flaunt my 1999 cassette cover of Deewana , one of Sonu Nigam’s hit albums. Sitting across a few thousand miles, inside a London suite, the singer flashes a grin that changes into a big smile very quickly. “The business of music was very one-dimensional back then,” he says, referring to the beginning stages of his career, “But so many things have changed since then. I have been witness to sweeping changes in the music industry — from cassettes, disks and CDs to digital platforms.” He is part of another huge trend currently: venturing into non-fungible tokens (NFTs), thanks to a partnership with Jet Synthesys. “It’s something precious, either from the past or a future prospect,” he says, “It is especially for people who value the artiste or content, and for those who treat it as an investment.” Sonu’s debut in this space will feature a special track titled ‘Hall of Fame’, which he worked on with composer-lyricist Jim Beanz a couple of years ago. “I have sung thousands of songs in the last few decades, but this was among the toughest to sing,” he reveals, “The reason I like legends like Mohammad Rafi and Kishore Kumar is not because of their evergreen hits, but because they have attempted some songs that are very difficult to sing. ‘Hall of Fame’ is my attempt to do something like that.” After ‘Hall of Fame’, the singer plans to release some other creative work of his as NFTs; that includes some hand-written papers that he personally wrote before recording some of his hit numbers. “I have this habit since I debuted as a singer; I always write the place, time and date and team working on it, when I record my songs, apart from marking my comments with respect to the scale and pronunciation. For any music lover or collector, to possess that sheet written by a singer is precious, because it is a memory only he or she can share.” In the future, he even hopes to work on albums exclusively for the NFT world. “I was mulling about doing something exclusively, probably on the works of Mir Taqi Mir or Faiz Ahmad Faiz. A musical project for an audio label is familiar among audiences, but a project exclusively as an NFT would be niche and sought after.” If he does that, it will be a flashback for him. For, Sonu Nigam is well known for his non-filmi musical outings in the Nineties. What gave him the confidence back then? “I realised that a lot of art could be created beyond it through independent projects. I was open to trying newer things.” It was probably that urge to break boundaries that led Sonu to the South. He is no stranger to Tamil music, having debuted with AR Rahman’s ‘Varayo Thozhi’ from Jeans (1998) and also subsequently singing for GV Prakash and many other composers. “I am lucky to have got the opportunity to work with the likes of Ilaiyaraaja and AR Rahman,” he says. “Late singer SPB was one of my special musical gurus; in fact, I sang ‘Aasman Kehta Hai Rab Se’ ( Mast ) keeping his delivery style in mind.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/for-the-record/article37675416.ece
25 November 2021||November 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Fact meets folklore||Director Priyadarsan says Mohanlal-starrer Marakkar: Arabikadalinte Simham , releasing in theatres on December 2, is his best in his career. In addition to Malayalam, it will be released in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Hindi.  Marakkar: Arabikadalinte Simham is touted to be the most expensive Malayalam film till date; its budget is reportedly over Rs. 100 crore. Set in the 16th Century, the film will revolve around the exploits of Kunjali Marakkar IV, a naval warrior and adventurer. Not many reliable accounts about the Marakkars exist. “There are conflicting stories,” admits Priyadarsan, “Nevertheless, the characters in my film are all historical figures. I have taken cinematic liberties. My script is a mix of fact, fiction and folklore.” With Mohanlal in the titular role, the cast includes Nedumudi Venu, Prabhu, Suresh Kumar, Arjun Sarja, Suniel Shetty, Manju Warrier, Keerthy Suresh, Siddique, Mukesh and Pranav Mohanlal. Except for a few shots of the sea at Kovalam, Thiruvananthapuram, the entire film was shot in Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad. Completed in 102 days, Priyadarsan asserts that the film could not have been be made without the help of art director Sabu Cyril, with whom he has worked in several films. “A one-acre water body filled with one-and-a-half lakh litres of water was created in Ramoji City. We built four ships that have never been to the ocean. Cinematographer Thirunavukarasu’s camera has never seen the sea during shooting; all the action on the high seas, the storms, the thundering waves were created with the help of VFX,” explains Priyadarsan. The film might be releasing only now but it has already won three National Film Awards: for best feature film, for costume and for VFX (done by the director’s son, Siddharth Priyadarsan). “Marakkar was a patriot whose loyalty to his land came above barriers of caste and religion. That is my message through this film.” Post Marakkar: Arabikadalinte Simham , Priyadarsan is busy directing a feature in Tamil with Urvashi in the lead. “I enjoyed reading the script of Appatha, a small film about a woman and her dog, that we are now making with Urvashi.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/fact-meets-folklore/article37675422.ece
25 November 2021||November 25 2021 00:00 IST,||The necklace tells a story||“There is a potent connection between narratives and jewellery in India, where jewellery propels the story forward. For example, in Shakuntala , by Kalidasa, the signet ring plays a crucial role in the story, and in Silapathikaaram , by Ilango Adigal, an ankle bracelet is the most important metaphor,” says Divya N, Chennai-based founder of Sayuri, a brand of mixed media jewellery. Her online exhibition, Jewellery in Narratives, brings together folk art and epics. The designer has created hand-painted jewellery, using the techniques of tholu bommalata, a form of shadow theatre from Nimmalakunta, Andhra Pradesh. “Revisiting familiar stories was fascinating and the experience provided me with a fresh perspective. I curated epics, temple histories and moral stories in which jewellery plays an important role, then showcased them on necklaces,” says Divya. All the detailing represented in the collection was derived from the epics. “When I was painting Sita inashokavana, I had to bring out her agony by using appropriate colour combinations.” The display has 15 designs derived from the Ramayana, Bhagavat Purana , Śhakuntala, Silapathikaaram, Ratnaavali, Temple Histories – Jataka tales and Hitopadesa.  The discussion for the project which began in April this year, was completed by the end of October. Divya designed the products in Chennai, while Sriramulu worked from Nimmalakunta. Dokra brass beads andpatwathread art components for jewellery were sourced from Chattisgarh. The final product was then shipped to Hyderabad to be photographed A unique aspect of this project is the concept of a “create with me” framework, where collaborators teach and learn skills from each other. “Normally designers create and artists follow the instructions. But in this project, I have broken that tradition. I learnt from artist Shinde Sriramulu. The artist also designed some pieces for the project,” says Divya. She adds, “Roles are fluid, where the artist becomes the designer and the designer becomes the artist.” Jewellery in Narratives is on view for a year athttps://jewelryin narratives.com/.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-necklace-tells-a-story/article37675434.ece
25 November 2021||November 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Talking to the tahr||It is a nippy morning, so we bask in the sun at Anamalai Tiger Reserve’s (ATR) Butterfly Park at Aliyar on Pollachi-Valparai Road, a two hour drive from Coimbatore. Like us, hundreds of butterflies soak in the sunshine, — dark blue tiger, blue tiger, and common crows — all buzzing around the small, purple flowers of t ha e l kodukku (Indian heliotrope). A little away, showy orange and red lantana blooms are attracting the plain tiger butterflies even as rows and rows of ornamental nithya kalyani with pink flowers, and yellow and red dahlias vie for attention. A stone pavement leads to the watchtower where visitors can enjoy a view of the spectacular Aliyar Dam and the expanse of the pristine blue water. There are carved replicas of birds, butterflies, and reptiles, including an intimidating king cobra, installed at the park to pique the interest of visitors. An artificial cascade draws children. As a part of the 20-member team led by V Selvam, Assistant Conservator of Forests, it is a good place to start the tour offered by the park. “The objective is to sensitise visitors on conservation by sharing knowledge,” says MG Ganesan, Deputy Director of ATR. “For November, we have called it Hornbill Festival to put the spotlight on the birds. Next month, we want to highlight another key species like the Nilgiri tahr, and then a primates tour to showcase the lion tailed macaques, grey and black langurs, Nilgiris langur, bonnet macaque and slender lorris, and then maybe tribal communities...it’s a long list,” he explains. Our next stop is the gushing waterfall Kavi Aruvi .“During a regular outing, vistors tend to just enjoy the views, dump plastic, and go back to their routine. In ecotourism, we keep reiterating the need on conserving resources,” states Selvam. As we drive to the ninth hairpin bend, we encounter a pair of Nilgiri tahr, roaming freely on the almost deserted ghat road. Another tahr lazes atop a hillock. A three-kilometre drive gets us to Attakatti Training Centre. For the next one hour, there are talks and videos on hornbills. Of the 54 species of hornbills across the world, nine are found in India, and four in South India. As frugivores, hornbills also need a large forest with ficus trees. However, logging of these trees as well as tree species that provide nesting have led to significant reduction in their population. “Hornbills could be seen in hundreds along this stretch. For the past three months, I am visiting every day, but am yet to catch a glimpse of a single bird. We are monitoring and protecting our rainforest as they are like sponges that conserve water,” states Selvam. He adds, “With landslides and floods, our rivers are drying up. We have to conserve to leave the forest in the safe hands of the future,” he says, adding, “After the tour, if you go back and plant one aala maram , arasa maram or ichi , it is a ray of hope.”  For bookings in December, call 9842595826||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/talking-to-the-tahr/article37675454.ece
25 November 2021||November 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Herod’s song||Drumroll please! The annual Mellow Circle Christmas play for a cause is back, after a pandemic-induced gap last year. While 2020 saw the production in the form of a movie, shot at 18 different locations, 2021 sees it return to the stage. It took Michael Muthu six days and 54 A4 sheets to come up with this year’s original play, titled The First Christmas . “I have done two edits so far, and now I am going to be merciless and edit the play further,” he says in between rehearsals. After doing plays for the Mellow Circle for 22 years now, Michael wanted to move away from the play’s well-loved Santa Claus and Christmas miracle formula. “This time it is darker.” he says, adding, “I wanted to do a story which explains why Christ was born, his journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem, and what the circumstances were.” The script is based on events in the Bible . But, this story is from Herod’s point of view. “Herod the Great did not want to lose his throne. So insecure was he that he killed his wife, brother, mother-in-law, and two sons. When he heard about the birth of the true king of the Jews who would take over the throne, he ordered the slaughter of all the children in Bethlehem. But Christ is saved. While Herod dies of gangrene,” says Michael. “I have introduced characters like Rachel and Barnabas to show how families were affected by the slaughter,” he adds. There are seven songs in the play, of which three are originals, written by Michael. The two-hour long play has a 32 member cast and 30 choristers. Yohan Chacko plays the role of the wicked Herod, a king going mad, whose main opponent is God, says Michael.  The First Christmas will be staged at the Sir Mutha Venkatasubba Rao Concert Hall on Sunday, November 28 at 7pm. The show is in aid of Prathyasha, the Home of Hope that Mellow Circle runs for children with HIV.  Donor passes priced at Rs. 5,000 for two, Rs. 1000, Rs. 600 and Rs. 300 will be available online atwww.5oh9.com, and at the Mellow Circle office: 9944224848.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/herods-song/article37675470.ece
25 November 2021||November 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Lean, clean killing machine||There comes a point in life where you feel you hit stagnation; where the pause is perpetual, sometimes even questioning yourself if you have lost the sense of objectivity. It is only natural for an artist or any creative person for that matter to elbow their way through the odds stacked against them. Somewhere around 2016, Abhishek Bachchan realised he was not satisfied with the kind of work he was doing, although some of his films during that interval were successful. He was brave to take a pause when he realised he had “slipped into his comfort zone” and came back with Manmarziyaan in 2018, in which his performance as Robbie was highly appreciated. Having been in the business of acting for 21 years, Abhishek says he wanted to recalibrate and come back and do the work that excited him. “As an actor, you cannot always be in your comfort zone. Sometimes you have to push your limits and if needed, stick your neck out,” he says. It is only fair to say that Abhishek has loosened up as an actor with some interesting choices: Ludo , Breathe: Into the Shadows and The Big Bull . He is now in the spin-off, Bob Biswas , based on an assassin character from the Hindi thriller Kahaani , directed by Sujoy Ghosh. He is also acting in the Hindi remake of Tamil experimental film Oththa Seruppu Size 7 . There is a slight excitement in his voice at the mention of whether we are witnessing Abhishek 2.0 where he is reinventing his career. “Not exactly reinventing but enjoying myself doing the work I like. Thankfully, I am also getting the work I personally want to do,” he says, ahead of of Bob Biswas , releasing on Zee5 on December 3. What did you think of Kahaani and Saswata Chatterjee’s performance as the original Bob Biswas?  I hadn’t seen Kahaani when I started shooting this film. I only ended up seeing the film during the lockdown for the first time. By that time we had almost finished most of the shoot. To have such a great impact in such a short time is testimony enough. It is a wonderful character, wonderfully written and performed. Spin-off as a concept is still relatively new in Indian cinema. What were your thoughts when Diya came to you with this idea about making a standalone film? I had signed on the film before I read the script. It was an emotional decision to make. But the kind of person I am, I tend to put relationships ahead of the professional game. Sujoy [Ghosh] is a very dear friend and when I got to know that Diya [Annapurna Ghosh] was making the film, it was obviously a ‘yes’. I was thankful and relieved when I heard the script because it was a great script and a great role. We never really discussed whether spin-offs work. The focus was on making a good film. You seemed to have killed the physicality of Bob Biswas. Was there a point during the course of the making where you felt you cracked the mental side of the character as well?  It is kind of immaterial what I think. It is what the audiences think that matters in the end. As actors you have to be 100% convinced about what you are doing. I don’t know any actor who is not completely prepared before they go to a film. Be it physically or mentally, you have to be completely prepared as we were. But as I said, it is immaterial what we think. The film also seems to deal with the moral dilemmas that Bob Biswas faces. As an actor, do you have such dilemmas when you play characters that are morally flawed?  Yes, I do. Of late, my entire thought process has changed. I decided not to do a film which my family couldn’t sit down and watch — but that is a personal choice. I do believe that I have certain moral responsibilities when it comes to work. Part of being an actor is the fun of getting to live lives you will not live personally. There is that fun aspect of it but I do understand the responsibility I have. But this is my personal belief.  Bob Biswas is written by Sujoy, and directed by Diya. To whom does the film belong?  I would say it belongs to Bob Biswas and me ( laughs ).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/lean-clean-killing-machine/article37675945.ece
25 November 2021||November 25 2021 00:00 IST,||The way back||Silambarasan aka Simbu’s career hit a pause when whispers about his unprofessionalism came to surface after AAA in 2017. As the whispers grew louder, with some producers even asking for compensation for losses incurred, Simbu felt he had hit rock bottom. The accusations and name-calling accumulated so much that Simbu says he did not know how to manage or even come out of the pitfall that he created. The journey turned out to be a long-term project than a quick fix. In an industry where issues related to mental health are either brushed aside or lack sensitivity, Simbu is a rare Tamil cinema star who has been vocal about what he went through. Starting out as a child actor in his father T. Rajendar’s films, Simbu admits that it was a low-point in his long career that only caused damage. He describes that phase as his “lockdown”. “I didn’t feel like coming out of the house and interacting with people. In spite of all that, I was acting and was trying to socialise with people,” he says, dressed in an olive green V-neck T-shirt, during a press interaction ahead of the Venkat Prabhu-directed Maanaadu releasing on Thursday. The actor turned to spirituality to come out of that place. “Now that I am finally out, I believe my potential will reflect in my work.” The realisation of having swam his way through what happened recently made Simbu emotional at the audio launch of Maanaadu . He made a dramatic statement, addressing his fans and well-wishers: “I will take care of my problems, you take care of me.” Simbu says he tried controlling his pent-up emotions, but he could not. “Even for this film [ Maanaadu ], there were a lot of problems from the start. We started shooting and then it was dropped, and we started again. The film, my weight loss journey and the pandemic — all of this affected me when I went on stage,” he says. Set against a political backdrop,  Maanaadu (Campaign) is about the concept of time loop, where the characters are trapped in a series of events that repeat themselves. But Simbu clarifies that the film is not overly political. Nor is he worried if audiences would understand such a high concept. In fact, what drew him towards Maanaadu was how simplified the concept has been presented by its director. “It is about a normal guy getting caught in this time loop [like Edge of Tomorrow and Source Code ]. Though the scenes repeat, you will see something new. That is what Venkat Prabhu has done, in a commercial way.” For Simbu, it was as much a journey of self-discovery as it was spiritual. In due course, he says he learnt a lesson or two; and how he has evolved as an actor and person. Which is why Simbu says he will not do a film like Vallavan in today’s times. “I was a boy then and hence acted in such commercial films. I have come out of that zone now. Cinema too has changed. Audiences are watching all sorts of content and they are no longer liking the cinema thanam ,” he says. “We need to cater to what today’s audiences want. For that, you will have to work with directors who are doing that,” he adds. Simbu has been talking to young filmmakers, although nothing has been finalised yet. In the next one year, he wishes to stay committed to his acting projects. He says, “I like the zone I am in right now... it’s peaceful. I need this space for me.”  I was a boy when I did films likeVallavan. I have come out of that zone now. We need to cater to what today’s audiences want Simbu   Spiritual Journey Simbu went through a drastic physical transformation last year, losing nearly 27 kilos. Lockdowns are when Simbu got the breathing time to schedule his day. “In the past, I have put on and lost weight for my character [like in Silambattam ]. But once you hit 30, your body doesn’t listen to you,” he says. Simbu switched to liquid diet, in addition to a fitness regimen that included working out and playing sports such as tennis, cricket and basketball. “My body couldn’t take it for the first two weeks and I struggled a lot. But that is something you should overcome.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-way-back/article37675946.ece
25 November 2021||November 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Wanted: India’s master brewer||Many people have spent half the lockdown playing barista, sitting at home. Some have even tested their gradually growing skills with different roasts, pitted themselves against different devices and played with experimental brewing styles. But have you ever wondered how good you really are, outside of your home kitchen and friends circle? As the Indian AeroPress Championship comes to Chennai, non-professional coffee brewers finally have a chance to pit their prowess against others in the city and the country — and the world, if they are good enough. Originally a brand known for sports equipment, the name AeroPress in 2005 became synonymous with the coffee making device, AeroPress, developed in the U.S. and introduced to the market by the same firm. Today, AeroPress is among the popular home-brewing methods for coffee lovers around the world. In December, Chennai will be one of 13 cities and regions to choose three talented amateur brewers for a final, national-level showdown, from which will be selected the Indian representative for the World AeroPress Championship to be held in Australia in 2022. The Indian leg of the contest is put together by the country’s growing fraternity of independent coffee roasters, planters and experts. In Chennai, the venue is being provided by Divya Jayashankar, founder of Beachville Coffee Roasters, and the raw ingredients by Akshay Vaidyanathan, founder of Kaapi Kottai. Judges are Auroville-based independent coffee pioneer Marc Tormo, and Viggnesh V., who documents the country’s growing coffee industry on his Instagram page, Roast Brew and You. Divya says, “The Chennai round will be held on December 5 at 11 a.m. The idea is that the people who brew with an AeroPress will be given one coffee, uniform across all contestants, and will have to use it in a way they like, to create a concoction that they prefer. They will be given 10 days to test and brew at home with the same coffee, and figure out what works best in their opinion — what their brew ratio is, what water temperature they prefer.” Registrations close on Thursday, after which organisers will ship the coffee — 250 grams of whole bean — out to participants. “Typically, most contestants will have a grinder at home and can fine-tune the grind according to their preference. Participants may also come over on the day of the event, and take a couple of tries getting the grind right on our in-shop grinder,” adds Divya. The team behind the Indian leg of contests is Bengaluru-based Benki Brewing Tools , whose founder, Suhas Dwarkanath, has been coordinating with roasters, planters and others in the fraternity, to conduct the regional rounds since 2017. “We started very small, with 38 contestants in total across the Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore rounds. When we last did it in 2019, before the pandemic, we were the second biggest competition in the world, with 221 participants in five cities. Spain was the biggest,” says Suhas over a phone call, between flying from city to city for each round. The scope of the contest in India has grown as steadily as the fraternity itself. Most major cities now have a community eager to experiment with bean to bar coffee. Each city chapter is supported by a different roastery sponsoring the venue, and startup sponsoring the coffee, be it Roastery Coffee House that hosts the Hyderabad and Kolkata contests, or original bean to bar brand Blue Tokai, which provided beans for Delhi. “There is no minimum requirement for the number of participants in a city,” says Suhas. “As long as a roastery can provide 650 square feet space, enough tables and electricity, and basic equipment including a grinder, they can host a round,” he says.

25 November 2021||Kolkata,||Civic polls: HC puts off hearing on BJP plea||The legal bottlenecks regarding holding polls to 112 civic bodies in West Bengal continue with the Calcutta High Court on Wednesday postponing the hearing of a petition by Bharatiya Janata Party to November 29. A Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava and Justice R. Bharadwaj, said it would hear the petition next Monday. The BJP has approached the court seeking that polls to all municipalities in West Bengal be held on a single day. The Trinamool Congress and the State Government are of the opinion that election to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and Howrah Municipal Corporation should be held on December 19 and that of other civic bodies later. The State Government has recently passed a Bill in the West Bengal Assembly for bifurcation of Howrah Muncipal Corporation. Meanwhile, West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Wednesday sought further details for consideration of Howrah Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Bill, 2021 under Article 200 of the Constitution. The Bill aims to bifurcate the wards of Howrah and Bally towns into two civic bodies. Mr. Dhankhar had earlier sought details of the Assembly proceedings and other issues relating to passing of the Bill. On Wednesday, the Governor rejected the arguments and deliberations presented by the State government and sought more details. Governor meets SEC This comes a day after Mr. Dhankhar met State Election Commissioner Sourav Das and wrote a letter underlining the need to hold polls on a single day. The Governor in his letter to Mr. Das said, “If the SEC were to toe the line of State Government and be merely its executing agency, treating itself as an extension of the State government, then the same would be an outrage of Constitution and also unwholesome for democratic process.” The Governor emphasised that SEC itself had mooted the idea of simultaneous elections to all the municipalities earlier. “The overwhelming political inputs are for the same. There does not appear to be any rationale for any deviation thereof,” the letter added. He also added that the authority of the SEC was at par with the Election Commission of India, it should be non-partisan and not an extension of the State Government. The five-year term of the elected members of 112 municipalities and corporations ended almost two years back but elections have not been held so far. These civic bodies are being run by administrators appointed by the State government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/civic-polls-hc-puts-off-hearing-on-bjp-plea/article37675957.ece
25 November 2021||GURUGRAM,||Give compensation for dead farmers: JJP leader||The Jannayak Janata Party general secretary Digvijay Chautala on Wednesday demanded that the Union Government must announce suitable compensation for the families of those farmers who died during the agitation against the three farm laws and also construct a memorial for them. Party foundation day Mr. Chautala was in Gurugram to address separate meetings of party workers in the district as part of the preparations for the proposed Jan Sarokar Diwas rally in Jhajjar on December 9 to mark the third anniversary of the JJP’s foundation day. Speaking to media persons, Mr. Chautala said he had been raising this issue for long and the Government would have to make a decision sooner or later. “Those in power can move forward only with the support of the masses. The laws have been repealed and this is the right opportunity. The announcement for the memorial and the compensation be made so we can win back their confidence,” said Mr. Chautala. Seeking an early resolution, Mr. Chautala said the earlier the matter was resolved, the better it would be. He added that the prolonged delay to settle the stalemate over the three farm laws had caused loss to the ruling dispensation politically and the nation as well. Earlier addressing the party workers, Mr. Chautala emphasised that the JJP was constantly working to deliver on the promises made during the elections. He said that 75% reservation for youth in private sectors was a historic move, besides 50% reservation for women in Panchayat elections. The party’s national president Ajay Singh Chautala visited the rally’s venue two days ago and gave directions to the party’s office-bearers and workers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/give-compensation-for-dead-farmers-jjp-leader/article37675963.ece
25 November 2021||Pune,||Showcasing Maharashtra’s rural milieu||The world according to indie filmmaker Santosh Ram is a very different one as seen through the eyes of his more privileged counterparts. Mr. Ram, the son of a humble schoolmaster from Udgir in Latur district, has showcased Maharashtra’s rural milieu and its hardscrabble lives with a sensitivity and realism like few others. After failing to get through the entrance exam to the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), he learnt his craft by watching classics screened at a National Film Archives of India (NFAI) film appreciation course. His latest film Prashna (‘Question’), a deeply thought examination of the lives of a seasonal sugarcane labourer couple and the problem of schooling faced by their child as a result of this migration, has been making waves in niche film festivals across the globe. Drolly dubbing himself an FTII ‘canteen pass-out’, Mr. Ram finally broke through with Vartul (Circle) in 2009 – a stunning 18-and-a-half-minute documentary that won 13 awards across India and put him on the Indie filmmaking map. The film has being selected for screening in 21 national and international film fests, most recently at the UNICEF Innocenti fest in Florence, Italy, and the London Migration Film earlier this week, while bagging no less than 14 awards in different categories including writing and cinematography.  Prashna is about an illiterate sugarcane labourer who uses her native intelligence to teach her child while coping with extant socio-economic and caste problems. Child marriage issue The idea for Prashna first  came about in 2011, when Mr. Ram decided to tackle the problem of rising child marriages across the State. “Given that this phenomenon was especially noticeable in the Marathwada and Vidarbha regions, I accordingly visited some of these places and began researching and found a number of heart-rending stories. It was during this research that a related problem of education of these children took hold. Child marriages and schooling intertwined when I started studying the migration of sugarcane workers from the Marathwada into the urban parts of Maharashtra,” he said. There are around 10 -15 lakh sugarcane workers in Maharashtra and of these, the problems of women workers, especially single women workers who are known as ardha koyta (literally ‘half sickle’), are strikingly complex as they get only half the payment as opposed to what couples get, Mr. Ram observes. The migration of these sugarcane farmers, who leave their homes in the Marathwada to work in the sugar heartland of western Maharashtra, ensures that their children are deprived of proper schooling for long stretches of time. “As a result, these sugarcane workers focus on getting their daughters and sons married off before they reach the ages of 13 and 16 respectively as they then would be eligible to be paid more or become full koyta (full sickle) as known in the colloquial. Either way, this leaves very little prospects for their education,” Mr. Ram says. He notes the challenge in Prashna was to show multiple stories and different, though intertwined issues in a lucid yet realistic manner in barely 24 minutes. Mr. Ram’s ‘stock company’ is drawn from the drought-stricken parts of the State. His selection and deployment of a crew of amateur actors acting alongside real subjects harks back to the techniques pioneered in Italian neorealist classics like Luchino Visconti’s La Terra Trema (1947), Vittorio de Sica’s Shoeshine (1946) and Bicycle Thieves (1948), Roberto Rossellini’s Germany Year Zero (1948), and legendary Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray’s Pather Panchali (1955). This is not to say that Mr. Ram sacrifices entertainment on the altar of serious artistry: quite the contrary, for he is a firm believer that the social message should go hand-in-hand with entertainment. “I have never pigeon-holed my works into ‘art house’ or ‘didactic message films’. Given that there were made for, and by, people who have themselves experienced major problems and obstacles, my films are accessible to all,” Mr. Ram said. Budgetary constraints The severe budgetary constraints meant that shooting had to take place with the actors living night and day among actual sugarcane labourers, absorbing their processes. “It was a real risk for me as a director. Alongside these inexperienced actors, we shot this film with the actual sugarcane workers in Chungi village in Solapur district. We would shoot all day with the cane workers, have lunch with them and continue shooting well into the night as they were loading the trucks,” Mr. Ram says. Mr. Ram says funding for his films come entirely through donations by friends with steadfast faith in his art. After his breakthrough film Vartul in 2009, Mr. Ram experienced three bitter, disillusioning years in Mumbai where he reminisces knocking in vain on doors of production houses. “It eventually dawned that there is no open-door entry for the likes of us. Every Assistant Director whom I saw used to come in a car of his own. I felt that I could not continue in this place where my output, which would have been mediocre anyway, would have been stifled by rigorous conformity to the system,” he says. Brilliant creation Determined not to compromise on his art, he returned to Udgir and produced yet another brilliant short, ‘Galli’ (The Lane). With Prashna , this ‘Indie celluloid boondocker’ has tackled yet another important and rarely addressed topic, and treated it with a mastery and passion that would put his more privileged counterparts in the shade.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/showcasing-maharashtras-rural-milieu/article37675959.ece
25 November 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Foundation laid for redevelopment project around Jagannath Temple||The foundation stone was laid on Wednesday for the ambitious Shree Mandira Parikrama Project (SMPP), which seeks to develop areas falling within 75 metres from the 12th century Shree Jagannath Temple, Puri. In the presence of Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, Dibyasingha Deb, Chairman of Shree Jagannath Temple Managing Committee and titular king of Puri, laid the foundation at the culmination of a three-day ‘yagna’ (special rituals). Being developed at an estimated investment of around Rs. 800 crore, the project will help create an unobstructed 75-metre corridor around the Meghanada Pacheri (outer wall of Shree Jagannatha Temple). For the first time in centuries, the redevelopment of the temple surroundings has been taken up in this scale. Upon completion of the project, devotees would get to see the temple from a distance. The corridor would also provide amenities for pilgrims and strengthen the safety and security of the temple and devotees, the Government said. “Today is a historic day for all Jagannath devotees across the globe. This is also a sacred day for Odisha,” Mr. Patnaik said emerging from the ‘yajna’. According to the plan, the Shree Jagannath Heritage Corridor (SJHC) abutting Meghanada Pacheri will be broadly divided into nine zones on the northern, southern and western side. The seven-metre green buffer zone (adjacent to Meghanada Pacheri) will consist of five-metre terraced landscape, the remaining section will include a two-metre hardscape area abutting Meghanada Pacheri for access by staff and maintenance purpose. Ceremonial procession of deities will be facilitated in the 10-metre ‘Antar’ (inner) ‘Pradakshina’ — pedestrian-only path for round the year. Besides, it will be used by the general public for ‘parikrama’ (clockwise circumambulation) of Shreemandira complex. A 14-metre landscape zone comprising a garden will have local varieties of trees and shrub. The eight-metre outer circumambulation path would be covered by trees on either side.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/foundation-laid-for-redevelopment-project-around-jagannath-temple/article37675955.ece
25 November 2021||Pune,||MVA Govt. announces pay hike; MSRTC workers refuse to budge||In a bid to break the impasse on the ongoing strike called by the workers of the cash-strapped Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC), the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) Government has announced a significant pay hike. State Transport Minister Anil Parab, who announced a 41% wage hike for all MSRTC employees and called upon the agitators to resume duties immediately, said salaries would now be paid before the 10th of every month. However, the Minister said the Government could not take a decision on the merger as it depended on the recommendations of the high-level committee which was appointed on the directives of the Bombay HC. “I urge all striking staffers to present themselves at work by 8 a.m. on Thursday. Those who have been terminated will have their terminations revoked once they report for duty,” he said. However, the strikers refused to budge on their main demand of merger of the MSRTC, with unruly scenes witnessed in Mumbai’s Azad Maidan and other places including Nashik and Aurangabad. BJP leaders Gopichand Padalkar and Sadabhau Khot, prominent faces of the agitation, said in Mumbai they would decide only after consultation with the agitators. “We will be talking with the MSRTC employees. We will spend the night in Azad Maidan and announce our decision by Thursday morning,” Mr. Khot said. Both Mr. Khot and Mr. Padalkar were present at the press conference with Mr. Parab. As per the offer, the new pay which comes into effect this month, workers with one to ten years of service would see a rise in basic pay by Rs. 5000.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/mva-govt-announces-pay-hike-msrtc-workers-refuse-to-budge/article37675964.ece
25 November 2021||Gautam Buddha Nagar,||Jewar town struggles to process new-found fame||The nondescript town of Jewar, 100 km from Delhi, is set to find a place on the world map as Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday will lay the foundation stone of an international airport that would be the largest in Asia and the fourth largest in the world. The first phase, built on 1,334 hectares , is expected to be completed by 2024 when one runway would become operational. However, for Hansraj, a resident of Rohi village, the immediate concern is what will he do with his eight cows if he decides to resettle in Jewar Bangar, a township being developed by the Uttar Pradesh Government for around 3,000 families of six villages whose land has been acquired under the Land Acquisition Act. “How will I tend to them in the 50 square metre plot that I would get,” asked Hansraj who tills one bigha of land. He is among around 500 of 9,000 farmers yet to accept the compensation deposited in the treasury by the Government. There are others. Like Pramod Kumar from Dayanatpur village, who has 20 bighas of land and feels that farmers were cheated by the Government when the land use was changed from rural to urban to cut down on the compensation. “The officials haven’t followed the provisions of the Act properly. Being in a rural area, we deserve compensation four times the circle rate, but by changing the land use, the Government has given us only twice the circle rate. Our petition is pending in the Allahabad High Court and we expect the PM to take note of our demand,” he said. He argued that they have been given compensation at the rate of Rs. 2,300 per square metre while the circle rate at Pari Chowk in Greater Noida is Rs. 50,000 per square metre. “If we have been declared urban, we should get the rates prevailing in the neighbouring urban areas. That’s why we approached the court,” he added. Ravinder Kumar from Rohi agreed with Pramod but he has taken the compensation and the plot. “I have received Rs. 2.5 crore for 12 bighas. I am building a three-storey house in the township but I could have got more,” he said. Neeraj Kumar from Rohera village has also chosen to wait. “I have heard officials are targeting those who didn’t accept the offer earlier. They ask for a cut in our money lying with the tribunal,” he alleged. A senior official said as per the Act, the permission of 70% of farmers was necessary. “In the beginning, only four farmers agreed but when the CM agreed to give Rs. 500 per sq. m. over the rate the farmers were entitled to, more than 72% agreed,” he said. Jewar MLA Dhirendra Singh said the BJP was known for “ushering in development” and on Thursday the region would “celebrate the PM’s visit as a festival.” The nondescript town of Jewar, 100 km from Delhi, is set to find a place on the world map as Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday will lay the foundation stone of an international airport that would be the largest in Asia and the fourth largest in the world.

25 November 2021||Pune,||Farm laws repealed with eye on polls: Pawar||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to repeal the contentious farm laws would not have been taken had there not been elections in Uttar Pradesh and other States in the near future, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar said on Wednesday. Speaking at Mahabaleshwar in Satara at the NCP’s youth wing convention, Mr. Pawar quashed the BJP’s prediction that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) Government would not complete its five-year term. “Elections are to be held soon in U.P. and other States...when those in power visited villages, they got a different kind of reception from what they expected...they might have sensed what kind of treatment they will get when they go to seek votes,” Mr. Pawar said. Taking potshots at State BJP president Chandrakant Patil’s frequent predictions of collapse of the MVA Government, Mr. Pawar expressed confidence that the coalition would not only complete its full term successfully but would come to power if elections were held at any point of time. Lambasting the Centre’s misuse of Central agencies in Maharashtra, he said there was nothing new about their actions and that their inquiries would yield no result. “I recently met West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee…there are six to seven Ministers from her Government who are presently harassed by the Central agencies. I am going to meet her in Mumbai soon, ” he said, adding that the Centre had taken a stand to “harass” the non-BJP States by unleashing agencies on them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/farm-laws-repealed-with-eye-on-polls-pawar/article37675961.ece
