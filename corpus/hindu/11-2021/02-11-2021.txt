02 November 2021||New Delhi,||India will achieve net zero emissions by 2070, says PM||India will achieve net zero emissions latest by 2070, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at the COP26 summit in Glasgow on Monday. By 2030, India will ensure 50% of its energy will be sourced from renewable energy sources. India will reduce its carbon emissions until 2030 by a billion tonnes. India will also reduce its emissions intensity per unit of GDP by less than 45%, the Prime Minister said. He added that in the spirit of climate justice, rich developed countries ought to be providing at least $1 trillion in climate finance to assist developing countries and those most vulnerable. Earlier, speaking at another event of the COP, Mr. Modi said there had not been as much focus on climate adaptation as much as mitigation and that was an injustice against developing nations. There are changes in cropping patterns, there are floods and a great need to make agriculture resilient to these shocks, he said. He said that sustainable modes of living being practised in certain traditional communities ought to be made part of school curricula and the lessons from India’s efforts at adaptation in programmes such as the Jal Jeevan Mission, the Swach Bharat Abhiyan and the Ujwala scheme ought to be popularised globally. India pushed for “safeguarding the interests of the developing world” as Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the G-20 summit at sessions on climate change and sustainable development on Sunday, said G-20 Sherpa and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/india-will-achieve-net-zero-emissions-by-2070-says-pm/article37295830.ece
02 November 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||YSR awards to be an A.P. Formation Day fixture||Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan and Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy presented the State government’s first YSR Life Time Achievement Awards and YSR Achievement Awards to 59 awardees, including organisations and individuals, at a ceremony in the city on Monday. The duo offered tributes to the busts of Potti Sriramulu and the late Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy wished the people of the State on the occasion of the State Formation Day and said that the YSR awards would be an annual programme on November 1. He said following the suggestions of many, the awards were initiated at the State level on the lines of the Padma awards of the Central government. Transparent selection “I am happy to be amongst the great people from the State. The name YSR reminds the Telugu people of his dressing style (pancha kattu) reflecting the Telugu culture, his love for agriculture, care for villages and the poor and his desire to provide education to everyone in the State,” Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said. “Today, even though he’s not amongst us, we have decided to give these awards in his memory. After the formation of this government, all the initiatives have been done transparently and, in line with it, the selection of awardees has been transparent. We have not seen caste, region, religion and even political affiliations or opinions. Though they have different opinions what mattered was their talent and contribution to society,” he said. “These are the most impartial awards in the history of the State and they reflect the Telugu culture, art and the people,” the Chief Minister said. “The awards are to recognise the hidden gems in our society and appreciate their priceless contributions. We have largely recognised people from the field of arts and culture in which the brand of Andhra Pradesh lies,” he said. “I am fortunate to spend time with the great personalities and felicitate them,” he added. Mr. Harichandan congratulated the awardees for their exemplary services rendered to society in their respective fields.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ysr-awards-to-be-a-state-formation-day-fixture/article37295821.ece
02 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Modi discusses Afghanistan with Boris Johnson||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday met his British counterpart Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the COP26 climate summit here and discussed ways to enhance cooperation in areas such as green hydrogen, renewables and clean technology, economy and defence. This was the first in-person meeting between the two leaders following the British Prime Minister’s twice cancelled visit to India earlier this year due to the pandemic. Strategic ties The interaction, soon after the opening ceremony of the World Leaders’ Summit at COP26, was scheduled to focus on the climate partnership and a review of the 2030 Roadmap for stronger strategic ties — signed by the two leaders during a virtual summit in May. Prime Minister Modi congratulated Mr. Johnson on successfully organising the COP26 and for his personal leadership in championing global action for climate change mitigation and adaptation. He reiterated India’s commitment to closely work with the U.K. on climate finance, technology, innovation and adaptation of green hydrogen, renewables and clean technologies including joint initiatives under the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, the Ministry of External Affairs said in a press release. Both Prime Ministers reviewed the implementation of the Roadmap 2030 priorities particularly in the trade and economy, people-to-people, health, defence and security areas. Both leaders also discussed regional and global challenges, including Afghanistan, counter-terrorism, Indo-Pacific, supply chain resilience and post-Covid global economic recovery.

02 November 2021||PATNA,||Four get death sentence in 2013 Patna serial blasts case||The special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court in Patna sentenced four persons convicted in the Patna serial blasts case of 2013 to death on Monday. It handed down life imprisonment to two others, 10 years in jail to another two and seven years’ imprisonment to one person. On October 27, the special NIA court of judge Gurvinder Singh Malhotra convicted nine of the 10 accused. One person was acquitted for lack of evidence. Six people were killed and 80 injured in the blasts at the ‘Hunkar’ rally of the National Democratic Alliance in Patna in October 2013. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was then the Gujarat Chief Minister, was among the leaders who attended the rally. SIMI, IM members All the accused were said to be members of the Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) and Indian Mujahideen (IM). An operative named Tariq Ansari had died while planting a bomb inside a toilet at the Patna Junction. Out of the nine convicts, six were from Ranchi in Jharkhand, two from Mirzapur in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh and one from Raipur in Chhattisgarh. All the accused are currently lodged in the Beur Central Jail in Patna. The NIA took up the case on November 6, 2013.

02 November 2021||Ghaziabad,||Priyanka-Jayant meeting creates a flutter||The meeting between Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) president Jayant Singh in the lounge of Lucknow’s Chaudhary Charan Singh Airport on Sunday created a flutter in political circles and media about a possible tie-up for the coming Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls. Curiously, photos of the hour-long meeting went viral on a day when Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav told a news agency that the alliance with the RLD had been finalised. While the RLD president termed it a mere “speculation” of the media, sources in the State Congress said the party did see the RLD as a “potential partner” in the State. “I made my statement in Lucknow on my ongoing positive conversation with the Samajwadi Party. I don’t change my view in a matter of one hour,” Mr. Singh told The Hindu . ‘Chat overchaat’ Senior RLD leader Shahid Siddiqui, who was present during the meeting, described it as “an informal chat over Lucknawichaat”. He said the party was in an alliance with the SP but didn’t rule out the possibility of a broader alliance with the Congress to keep out the BJP. Observers feel that it could be a ploy to bargain for more seats from the SP in west U.P., where the RLD feels it could do better than its partner. Vivek Bansal, senior Congress leader from western U.P. and the party’s Haryana in-charge, observed that when two leaders meet, they discuss politics. “I don’t know about broad or narrow but we are looking at the RLD as a potential partner in the Assembly election. It is up to them to take a call.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/priyanka-jayant-meeting-creates-a-flutter/article37296214.ece
02 November 2021||Vijayawada,||Governor’s name in SDC loan documents sparks controversy||Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan is believed to have expressed his objection to his name reportedly figuring in some loan documents of the Andhra Pradesh State Development Corporation (APSDC). The development is learnt to have set senior government officials on a damage control mission. The Governor’s name has apparently been mentioned against the ‘Address for Notice’ column in the ‘Description of Guarantor’ section, raising concerns on his personal liability with regard to the loans raised by the State Development Corporation, which is already mired in litigation in the High Court consequent upon the filing of some Public Interest Litigations (PILs) including one by Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) from Visakhapatnam (East) constituency Velagapudi Ramakrishna Babu. The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) MLA and other petitioners questioned the constitutional validity of the APSDC itself and the manner in which it sought to mobilise funds for the implementation of various schemes. Following the Governor’s objection, government officials are learnt to have initiated corrective measures with Secretary (Finance) K.V.V. Satyanarayana recently informing the court through a common counter that the reference to the Governor’s name in Schedule 3 of the loan guarantee agreement is only incidental to the details provided thereof and does not expose the Governor to potential proceedings in violation of Article 361 of the Constitution. A complete reading of the terms of the contract would indicate that there is neither an intent nor the consequence of waiver of his (Governor’s) personal immunity. The deponent is an officer of the State under Article 309 of the Constitution representing the Governor as provided for in various G.O.s related to the State Development Corporation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/governors-name-in-sdc-loan-documents-sparks-controversy/article37296410.ece

02 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Cannot impose blanket ban on all firecrackers, says SC||The Supreme Court on Monday said a blanket ban on firecrackers may not be possible, but measures ought to be in place to prevent the use of toxic chemicals in firecrackers. This is the second time in the past few days that the court had accepted the improbability of imposing a total ban on firecrackers. On October 29, the court had made it clear that there was no total ban on use of firecrackers. “Only those firecrackers are banned which are found to be injurious to health and affecting the health of citizens,” the court had noted in an order. On Monday, a Special Bench of Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and Ajay Rastogi orally said there could not be a complete ban of firecrackers. The firecracker industry had moved the top court after the Calcutta High Court “prohibited the sale, purchase, use, display or bursting of firecrackers of any type at all during the upcoming Kali Puja, Diwali celebration as well as the following Chatt Puja, Jagadhatri Puja, Guru Nanak’s Birthday and/or Christmas/New Year’s Eve this year in the State of West Bengal”. “Strengthen the mechanism to stop misuse,” the apex court reiterated its advice, with a reference to its October 29 order. The Special Bench was setting aside a Calcutta High Court order which had ordered a complete ban on the use of firecrackers on October 29, coincidentally the very same day on which the top court had said such a measure was not advisable. The Bench said the High Court order was “extreme”. The HC should have heard the industry, which employs thousands of workers, before passing any such order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cannot-impose-blanket-ban-on-all-firecrackers-says-sc/article37295832.ece

02 November 2021||CHENNAI,||Chennai Metro sees pre-COVID level footfall||Nearly a year-and-a-half after the pandemic struck, Metro Rail has been close to touching the pre-COVID levels of patronage with about 1.12 lakh passengers travelling daily on an average during the weekdays. Before COVID-19, the figure was 1.25 lakh passengers a day. In October, 29.6 lakh passengers travelled by Metro. The fact that more and more people were returning to Metro trains showed signs of recovery and this was likely to improve in the coming months, sources said. After the services resumed in June this year, the number of passengers travelling had grown as the COVID-19 restrictions were removed one after the other and offices re-opened in many areas. From 3.55 lakh passengers in June, the number of passengers rose sharply to 18.46 lakh in July and then to 22.7 lakh in August. According to Chennai Metro Rail Ltd. (CMRL) officials, 26.8 lakh passengers travelled in September and this rose by 10% in October. “Apart from having more number of office-goers, owing to festival season, we had a lot of people travelling to places like Forum Mall for shopping and to the beach. Also, we had people taking the usual joy rides during the Navaratri holidays last month,” an official said. The day before the long weekend, there was a surge in the number of passengers as people were heading to railway stations, Koyambedu bus stand and airport, another official said. Central Metro station sees the maximum number of about 8,000 to 9,000 passengers while airport and Thirumangalam stations come second with about 5,000-5,500 passengers on weekdays. Nehru Park and Shenoy Nagar have the lowest number of users with just 800-900 passengers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/metro-sees-pre-covid-level-footfall/article37295927.ece

Chandran, former Students’ Federation of India (SFI) leader and daughter of a Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] local leader, who had alleged that her baby had been given up for adoption by her parents without her knowledge approached the Kerala High Court on Monday seeking a directive to the police to produce her one-year-old child before the court and to hand over the baby to her. Abandoned In her habeas corpus petition, Anupama said she had been in the dark about her baby for 12 months. She gave birth to a baby boy on October 19, 2020 and after four days the child was taken away and abandoned by her parents, who were in immediate custody of the child, without the consent of the petitioner. She alleged that the police, child welfare committee and her parents, with a common intention, had conspired to isolate her four-day-old child from her and denied it all the basic human rights of an infant. Despite the fact that a kidnapping case was under investigation and the adoption process was stayed by the court, the Minister for Women and Child Development had said in the Assembly that the adoption of the child was in accordance with the law. The petitioner feared that the statement by the Minister might influence the investigation and litigation before a family court. Anupama alleged that her parents had forcefully isolated the child from her on the pretext of COVID-19 restrictions and placed the child in ‘Amma Thottil’ run by the Kerala State Council for Child Welfare. The council had not complied with the provision of the Juvenile Justice Act regarding the surrender of an abandoned child. ‘Influential leaders’ She said her parents were highly influential political leaders and they did not accept her love affair with Ajith Kumar, the baby’s father. When they came to know about her pregnancy, the parents had compelled her to abort the child with help of a family friend, a gynaecologist. The petitioner refused, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/anupama-moves-hc/article37296171.ece

02 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Festive season fires up Oct. GST revenues||The country’s gross GST (Goods and Services Tax) revenues crossed the Rs. 1.3 lakh crore mark in October, the second highest collection since the tax regime was implemented in July 2017. The Union Finance Ministry said this reflected the recovery of economic activity and would have ‘still been higher if the sales of cars and other products had not been affected on account of disruption in supply of semi-conductors’. October’s GST kitty was 24% higher than the same month a year ago and 36% over the pre-pandemic levels of 2019. Year-on-year surge This was driven largely by a 39% year-on-year surge in collections from import of goods, while domestic transactions and import of services were 19% higher than October 2020. ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar attributed October’s healthy growth in revenues to ‘pre-festive season stocking and improved compliance’. Semiconductor supply challenges could continue to constrain GST compensation cess collections, she pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/festivity-fires-up-gst-revenues-to-rs-13-lakh-cr/article37295839.ece

China recently tested a hypersonic weapon capable of partially orbiting the earth before re-entering atmosphere and gliding on a manoeuvrable path to its target. Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the test was “very close” to being a Sputnik moment, akin to the 1957 launching by the Soviet Union of the world's first space satellite.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/chinas-military-push-rattles-pentagon/article37295873.ece
02 November 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,||Firecrackers banned in MTR||Forest Department officials at the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) distributed pamphlets to tourists, members of the public and resort owners urging them to refrain from playing loud music and lighting firecrackers during Deepavali. “Shining of bright spotlights, playing of loud music, bursting of firecrackers and gathering [in] large numbers… in forest fringe areas cause major disturbance to wildlife. The unusual noise and lighting of crackers leads to disorientation of large herbivores and carnivores, which may result in them abandoning their young ones. Further, it will also result in straying of wild animals into human habitations,” said a pamphlet issued by S. Kaanthan, Forest Range Officer, Singara Range, to resort owners and the public in Masinagudi, Achakarai and Mavanallah villages. P. Arunkumar, Deputy Director of MTR (Buffer Zone), appealed to the public to celebrate a “green” Deepavali. The Nilgiris district administration has said that firecrackers should only be lit from 6 a.m. to 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. on November 4.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/firecrackers-banned-in-mtr/article37295989.ece

02 November 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Panel to talk to farmers: Haryana CM||Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal on Monday said that the State Government was making constant efforts to open the ‘Singhu and Tikri’ borders, which he added were closed by the farmers, and asserted that the problem can be solved only through dialogue. Scores of farmers have been camping for over 11 months now at several places including Singhu-Tikri on Delhi’s borders, demanding the repeal of the three farm laws enacted by the Union Government. Plea for dialogue Mr. Khattar, who was addressing a press conference here on the occasion of the 56th Haryana Divas, said the State Government has constituted a committee under the chairmanship of the Home Secretary to hold talks with the protesting farmers for clearing the blockade on the Kundli-Singhu and Tikri borders. “Discussions are under way. Along with this, the Supreme Court has also taken cognisance in this matter. Due to the closure of the border, the people travelling along with the local residents and traders are facing inconvenience. The people blocking the highway should understand the problem and come forward for dialogue,” he said. Mr. Khattar said that in the coming days, he would visit all the 90 Assembly constituencies of the State and interact with the people. “Due to the pandemic, the tours could not be conducted for some time. Now the programmes for the next two months have been prepared,” he said. The Chief Minister’s remarks come even as leaders of the BJP and its coalition partner, the Duhsyant Chautala-led Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), have been facing a backlash from farmers over the Centre’s farm laws during the past few months. Farmer outfits have announced that all legislators who have backed the Centre’s farm laws will be boycotted and not be allowed entry into villages across the State. Toying with the youth Mr. Khattar said transparency in recruitments was one of the focuses of his government and complete transparency was being adopted in the recruitment by the Haryana Staff Selection Commission and Haryana Public Service Commission. However, senior Congress leader from Haryana and party’s national general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala said the BJP-JJP government and Haryana Staff Selection Commission had once again made a mockery of the competence, ability and potential of the youth. He accused them of destroying the entire examination system, the manner of preparing the paper and the method of taking the exam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/panel-to-talk-to-farmers-haryana-cm/article37295751.ece
02 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Sign off on Paris Rulebook, says BASIC||On the opening day of the 26th United Nations Conference of Parties (COP), Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav delivered a statement on behalf of the BASIC group of countries — Brazil, South Africa, India and China — at the U.N. Climate Change Conference under way in Glasgow. These major developing economies are significant polluters but bear diminished responsibility for the carbon dioxide that has been pumped into the atmosphere since 1850 and also have low per capita emissions because of their significant populations. These countries have therefore for many years sought to rebuff pressure from developed countries to take on firmer emission reductions. Mr. Yadav said a key demand of the BASIC was that the Paris Agreement Rulebook be concluded at COP26. While the Paris Agreement laid out the framework for international action, the Rulebook will set this Agreement in motion by laying out the tools and processes to enable it is implemented fairly and properly. Countries had agreed to develop and finalise the Paris Rulebook at COP24 in Poland in 2018. “In doing so, full effect must be given to implementation of the principles of Equity and Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC) and, recognition of the very different national circumstances of Parties,” Mr. Yadav said in his written statement and underlined that developing countries must be accorded time, policy space and support to transition towards a low emissions future. Mr. Yadav reiterated BASIC demands that he has also spelt out in India that COP26 must aim for higher global ambition on climate finance and adaptation as well, along with recognition of the Parties’ differing historical responsibilities and the developmental challenges faced by developing countries, compounded by the pandemic. In the statement, Mr. Yadav recalled the “bottom-up nature” of the Paris Agreement and the freedom of Parties to determine their NDCs and progressively update them based on the outcomes of the Global Stocktake cycle — that specifies the actual progress made by countries so far in mitigating emissions — and as per national circumstances and call of science. The latest available science makes it clear that all Parties need to immediately contribute their fair share and achieving this would require developed countries to rapidly reduce their emissions and dramatically scale-up their financial support to developing countries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sign-off-on-paris-rulebook-says-basic/article37295577.ece
02 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Parachute unit practises combat manoeuvres||As the Army prepares to remain deployed in large numbers in the high-altitude areas of eastern Ladakh with the stand-off with China still unresolved, the 50th Parachute Brigade is conducting an airborne exercise and combat manoeuvres along the northern borders in the region to validate its rapid response capabilities. “On Monday, airborne troops were inserted to a drop zone at an altitude of more than 14,000 feet,” an Army source said on Monday. “Pre-acclimatised troops, along with specialist vehicles and missile detachments, were transported via C-130 and AN-32 aircraft from five different mounting bases to validate inter-theatre moves, precision stand-off drops, rapid grouping and capture of designated objectives with speed and surprise.” The drop was particularly challenging due to the low temperatures of up to minus-20 degrees and rarefied atmosphere in super high-altitude terrain, the source said. The exercise involves use of oxygen systems during free fall jumps and integrated battle drills by airborne forces, mechanised columns and attack helicopters for seamless integration. The parachute brigade is known as the Shatrujeet Brigade. With winter approaching, the Army has mostly completed its stocking to support the troops for the next few months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/parachute-unit-practises-combat-manoeuvres/article37295765.ece
02 November 2021||Ghaziabad,||Priyanka-Jayant meeting creates a flutter in U.P.||The meeting between Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) president Jayant Singh in the lounge of Lucknow’s Chaudhary Charan Singh airport on Sunday created a flutter in political circles and media about a possible tie-up for the coming Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls. Curiously, photos of the hour-long meeting went viral on a day when Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav told a news agency that the alliance with the RLD had been finalised. While the RLD president termed it a mere “speculation” of the media, sources in the State Congress said the party did see the RLD as a “potential partner” in the state. The RLD chief stated that there was “no plan or discussion on an alliance with the Congress.” “I made my statement in Lucknow on my positive ongoing conversation with the Samajwadi Party. I don’t change my view in a matter of one hour,” he told The Hindu . Senior RLD leader Shahid Siddiqui, who was present during the meeting, described it as “an informal chat over Lucknawi chaat” where the possibility of “an alliance was not discussed”. He said the party was in an alliance with the SP but didn’t rule out the possibility of a broader alliance with the Congress to keep out the BJP. “It was a mere coincidence that the two leaders met but it is a fact that after seeing the tremendous response to Jayant Singh’s rallies in west U.P. over the last one month, every party wants to align with the RLD,” he said. Observers feel that it could be a ploy to bargain more seats from the SP in west U.P., where the RLD feels it could do better than its partner, riding on the farmers’ movement. “The SP and the RLD are natural allies but in its current form, the RLD needs to contest from a respectable number of seats as it could defeat the BJP,” said a senior party leader. ‘A potential partner’ Vivek Bansal, senior Congress leader from west U.P. and party’s Haryana in charge, observed that when two political leaders meet, they discuss politics. “I don’t know about broad or narrow but we are looking at the RLD as a potential partner in the Assembly elections. It is up to them to take a call.” He didn’t deny the media speculation that the meeting was arranged by Haryana Rajya Sabha member Deepender Hooda, who is known to be close to the RLD president.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/priyanka-jayant-meeting-creates-a-flutter-in-up/article37295755.ece
02 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Australia recognises Covaxin||The Government of Australia has recognised Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. This recognition from the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) of the Department of Health will enable travellers fully vaccinated with Covaxin to travel to the country. With Monday’s announcement, Australia has become the first major economy to grant recognition to both the Indian-manufactured vaccines — Covishield and Covaxin. Modi thanks Morrison Prime Minister Narendra Modi has praised Australia’s decision. “I thank my dear friend PM Scott Morrison for Australia’s recognition of India’s Covaxin. It is an important step forward in the post-COVID partnership between India and Australia,” he said in a social media message. An announcement from the TGA said the recognition was for travellers aged 12 and over. “In recent weeks, the TGA has obtained additional information demonstrating these vaccines provide protection and potentially reduce the likelihood that an incoming traveller would transmit COVID-19 infection to others while in Australia or become acutely unwell due to COVID-19,” declared the announcement. It stated that the relevant information regarding the vaccine was provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the vaccine sponsors. The announcement noted that anyone who had received two doses of a TGA-recognised vaccine “at least 14 days apart is regarded as fully vaccinated from 7 days after the second dose”. Travellers with two doses of the same vaccine or two doses of two different vaccines (heterologous) too would be considered fully vaccinated seven days after the second dose.  Australia’s announcement also covered BBIBP-CorV, manufactured by Sinopharm of China. Tourist flow Recognition of the Indian and Chinese manufactured vaccines are a new step in the direction of gradual reopening of Australia to global tourist flow. This will also help Indian students to return to Australia. Australia’s Foreign Minister Marise Payne, during her latest visit to Delhi, had said that the country would open up in phases and that she herself would be present at the airport to receive Indian students when they returned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/australia-recognises-covaxin/article37295768.ece
02 November 2021||Kolkata,||Rescue guide launched for Ganges river dolphin||The Jal Shakti Ministry on Monday released a guide for the safe rescue and release of stranded Ganges river dolphins. The document has been prepared by the Turtle Survival Alliance and the Environment, Forest and Climate Change Department (EFCCD) of the Uttar Pradesh Government. The guide has been drawn from years of experience of rescuing 25 Ganges river dolphins stranded in irrigation canals. The Ganges river dolphin is the national aquatic animal of India and is listed as ‘endangered’ under the IUCN Red List Assessments, Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act (1972), Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The species, whose global population is estimated at 4,000, is mostly found in the Indian subcontinent. The dolphins often accidentally enter canals in northern India and are unable to swim up against the gradient. They are also vulnerable to harm by people. The manual is endorsed by the IUCN Cetacean Specialist Group. Best practices on crowd control, dolphin capture from canals and handling, transfer, transport and release are part of the guide. “Found throughout the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna and Karnaphuli-Sangu river systems of Nepal, India and Bangladesh, the Ganges river dolphin [ Platanista gangetica gangetica] is a global priority and is also an indicator of healthy aquatic systems,” said Shailendra Singh, director of Turtle Survival Alliance, India. The guide was also simultaneously released via local fishermen at the Ghaghra river, a prime habitat where most of the rescued dolphins were released in the past few years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rescue-guide-launched-for-ganges-river-dolphin/article37295772.ece

Mr. Patnaik also demanded enhancement of the labour budget of Odisha under the MGNREGS to 25 crore person days for the year 2021-22. He shot off a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi drawing his attention to pending liabilities of Rs. 1,088.72 crore (Rs. 377.91 crore as wage component and Rs. 710.8I crore as material component) under the MGNREGS for Odisha. “Timely payment of wages to poor jobseekers is the fundamental guarantee under the MGNREG Act. Similarly, timely release of payment for material is critical for creation of tangible and durable assets under the MGNREGS”, Mr. Patnaik mentioned in the letter. The Chief Minister sought the Prime Minister’s direction to the Ministry of Rural Development for timely release of funds. Mr. Patnaik pointed out that significant number of returnee migrants stayed back due to the reduced level of economic activities during the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/release-mgnregs-funds-says-odisha-cm/article37295734.ece
02 November 2021||JAIPUR,||Ex-SBI chief arrested in loan scam||The Chief Judicial Magistrate’s Court in Rajasthan’s Jaisalmer city on Monday sent former Chairman of the State Bank of India (SBI) Pratip Chaudhuri, who was arrested from his Delhi residence for an alleged loan scam involving a hotel, to judicial custody for 14 days after rejecting his bail application. Mr. Chaudhuri was arrested on the warrants issued by the Court. The case against Mr. Chaudhuri, who retired from SBI in 2013, pertains to two hotel properties worth Rs. 200 crore in Jaisalmer having been sold at a much lower price of Rs. 25 crore after declaring them non-performing assets (NPA). The Godawan Group had taken a loan of Rs. 24 crore from the SBI for its hotel project in 2007. The project remained incomplete for over three years, while another hotel of the group was functioning. The key promoter died in April 2010, after which the account slipped into NPA in June 2010. The SBI moved to seize both the hotels when Mr. Chaudhuri was the chairman and later sold them to an asset reconstruction company (ARC), Alchemist, at Rs. 25 crore as part of its recovery efforts. Mr. Chaudhuri joined Alchemist as a director after his retirement from SBI. The borrower, who had initially lodged a first information report (FIR) with the police against the sale of assets to Alchemist ARC, filed a protest petition in the CJM’s Court on being aggrieved by the closure report filed by the police authorities. In a clarification on the matter, the SBI stated on Monday that the sale to the ARC was carried out through “a laid down process as per the policy of the bank”. The SBI said the borrower was subjected to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) process by the ARC and the assets had been acquired by a non-banking financial company in December 2017, again through due process under the orders of the National Company Law Tribunal, New Delhi. The SBI affirmed that it was not made a party to the case, while all the directors of the ARC, including Mr. Chaudhuri who joined their board in October 2014, had been named in the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ex-sbi-chief-arrested-in-loan-scam/article37295738.ece
02 November 2021||Srinagar,||Centre driving a wedge in J&K: PDP||The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Monday accused the Central Government of “creating and fostering new fault lines between the people of Jammu and Kashmir”. Immediately after chairing a meeting of the Political Affairs Committee (PAC) of the party, PDP president Mehbooba Mufti observed that New Delhi was resorting to ‘naked communalism’ and pitting people against each other on the basis of religion, cast, sect and ethnicity. They were the only tools of the BJP to cover up its failure in governance. Hence divisive policies were gaining fresh ground and promoted unabashedly. A PDP spokesman said the PAC meeting noted that New Delhi was further dividing J&K people “to accomplish the agenda of complete disempowerment of people.” The party wanted people to collectively rise in unison to defeat such plans. The meeting also highlighted that apart from being robbed of their constitutional and democratic rights, people were slowly witnessing the catastrophic ramifications of the BJP- RSS plans in sectors such as business, employment, right to natural resources etc., the spokesman alleged. “The abject failure of the BJP government has given J&K the dubious distinction of having the highest unemployment rate in the country,” the PDP claimed. Party chief spokesperson Syed Suhail Bukhari asserted that the PAC would redouble its efforts to fight the designs of dividing and disempowering the J&K people and would give voice to the concerns and aspirations of all the people of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh. He sought the immediate release of all political prisoners and speedy and impartial investigation into cases of recent civilian killings. Earlier in the day, Ms. Mufti alleged that she was disallowed to meet the family of a civilian, who was killed in a “crossfire” on October 25 in south Kashmir. Mehbooba’s charge “When anyone is being killed by the militants, they (politicians) are being allowed to meet the slain family. It's unfortunate that whenever anyone is being killed in the forces’ action, no one is being allowed to meet the bereaved family,” she remarked. The former Chief Minister had desired to meet the family of Anantnag’s Shahid Aijaz, who was killed in a firing incident at Babapora area of Shopian near a CRPF camp. According to the police, he died in the crossfire between militants and security personnel. However, his family contested the police version.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-driving-a-wedge-in-jk-pdp/article37295745.ece
02 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Major swap of diplomatic postings||Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates Pavan Kapoor has been appointed envoy to Russia, the Ministry of External Affairs announced on Monday, part of a major reshuffle of postings in the neighbourhood and other major capitals. In a series of “round-robin” postings, Mr. Kapoor is being replaced by High Commissioner to the Maldives Sanjay Sudhir, who is in turn being replaced by Ambassador to Oman Munnu Mahawar. Amit Narang, Joint Secretary for the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) and handling relations with the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Mauritius and other island neighbours from headquarters, has now been appointed Ambassador to Oman. In addition, Director General of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations Dinesh Patnaik will head to Spain as envoy in the next few months, the MEA announced. Secretary, Consular Passports and Visas, and Overseas Indian Affairs (CPV &OIA) Sanjay Bhattacharyya is expected to head to Switzerland and appointments to Mexico and Myanmar are expected shortly. The Government has also extended the tenure of External Affairs Minister’s special adviser Ashok Mallik for another year. According to Ministry insiders, the reshuffle is one of two major such exercises to be carried out in the next few months, ahead of Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla’s retirement due in April 2022. However, it is unclear whether Mr. Shringla, who has worked closely in the foreign service with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, will be given an extension. Mr. Kapoor is taking over the important P-5 posting in Russia from Ambassador Venkatesh Varma, who is retiring after an eventful tenure that began in 2018, shortly after the informal summit in Sochi between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/major-swap-of-diplomatic-postings/article37295749.ece
02 November 2021||Ghaziabad,||Positive talks going on with Samajwadi Party: Jayant Singh||Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) president Jayant Singh on Monday said “positive” talks were on with the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh. Dismissing any plan or discussion on an alliance with the Congress following his hour-long meeting with Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra at the Lucknow airport, he said: “I made my statement in Lucknow on my positive ongoing conversation with the Samajwadi Party. I don’t change my view in a matter of one hour.” ‘Chat over chaat’ Senior RLD leader Shahid Siddiqui, who was present during the meeting, described it as “an informal chat over Lucknawi chaat” where the possibility of “an alliance was not discussed”. He said the party was in an alliance with the SP but didn’t rule out the possibility of a broader alliance with the Congress to keep out the BJP. “It was a mere coincidence that the two leaders met but it is a fact that after seeing the tremendous response to Jayant Singh’s rallies in western U.P. over the last one month, every party wants to align with the RLD,” he said.

Imran Masood, Congress strongman from Saharanpur, recently urged the party to align with the SP in a television interview as it “didn’t have the cadre to make an impact at the grassroots level”. “It was Mr. Masood’s personal opinion. The party will take a call on it,” Mr. Bansal said. Notably, in her Gorakhpur rally on Sunday, Ms. Vadra had targeted the SP and the Bahujan Samaj Party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/positive-talks-going-on-with-samajwadi-party-jayant-singh/article37296002.ece
02 November 2021||Mumbai,||Deshmukh appears before ED||Former Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh on Monday appeared before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) office for questioning in an alleged money laundering and extortion case, even as he slammed the ‘witch hunt campaign launched’ against him. “On account of a witch hunt campaign launched at the instance of certain vested inimical interests, some blatantly false allegations have been levelled by those persons who have absolute no credibility, honour or pride. These unscrupulous persons are themselves knee-deep involved in several rackets of extortion, fraud and even murder. The principal person who held the high office of Commissioner of Police is now a wanted absconding criminal,” said Mr Deshmukh in a statement, referring to the absconding IPS officer Param Bir Singh. It was Mr. Singh’s letter claiming that the former minister had sought Rs. 100 crore from hoteliers in Mumbai through now dismissed officer Sachin Waze, that led to the probe through central agencies including the Central Bureau of Investigation and the ED. The ED had issued summons four times in the past but he failed to appear and had moved to the Bombay High Court seeking no coercive action against him. The court rejected his appeal last week, following which he appeared before the agency on Monday. Mr Deshmukh said he has taken constitutional remedies for the protection of his life and liberty and his petition challenging the proceedings under PMLA is pending adjudication is pending before the Supreme Court. “A false narrative and an erroneous impression is being created by these vested interests that I am evading or avoiding to appear before the ED,” said Mr. Deshmukh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/deshmukh-appears-before-ed/article37296218.ece
02 November 2021||JAIPUR,||Judge suspended on charges of sexual assault||A Special Judge, dealing with the Prevention of Corruption Act cases, in Bharatpur city of Rajasthan has been suspended after a first information report was registered against him and two others on the charge of sexually assaulting a minor boy. An Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) officer was also suspended for allegedly threatening the 14-year-old. The Rajasthan High Court issued orders late on Sunday night placing Jitendra Singh, who is of the District Judge cadre, under suspension with immediate effect pending preliminary enquiry and the contemplated departmental inquiry. In a complaint lodged with the police, the boy’s mother alleged that Mr. Singh and two other persons had been sexually assaulting her son for the last one month after intoxicating him with a narcotic substance. The judge and the two other accused had threatened the boy with implicating his family in false cases if he spoke about the assault to anyone, according to the complaint. Mr. Singh allegedly befriended the boy at the District Club in Bharatpur, where he used to play tennis. He allegedly took the boy to his residence and had sex with him several times. The matter came to light when the minor told about this to his mother last week. The other accused were identified as Anshul Soni, the judge’s stenographer, and Rahul Katara, another staff member of the court. The FIR has been registered at the Mathura Gate police station. The victim’s family also alleged that ACB Circle Officer Parmeshwar Lal Yadav had threatened to kill the boy. The Home Department has placed Mr. Yadav under suspension as per the Rajasthan Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1958. A video of Mr. Singh apologising to the boy and his mother has gone viral on social media in Bharatpur. The police will verify the video during the investigation.

In a statement, he denounced rumours of shortage and urged farmers not to hoard fertilizers.

Mr. Mandaviya reviewed production targets for November with the officials and issued the statement. “While the demand of urea is 41 lakh tonnes, 76 lakh tonnes of urea will be produced. Similarly, 18 lakh tonnes of DAP will be produced against a projected demand of 17 lakh tonnes. Supply of 30 lakh tonnes of NPK will surpass the demand of 15 lakh tonnes,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/production-of-fertilizers-will-surpass-demand-minister/article37295579.ece

Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav had on Sunday said that principles of Equity and Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC) and, recognition of the very different national circumstances of countries be respected. Taking on net zero targets, requires a sharp shift to clean energy sources that several experts have opined, will impose a steep cost. Earlier speaking a a side-event at the COP, Mr Modi said there had not been as much focus on climate adaptation as much as mitigation and that is an injustice against developing nations. There are changes in cropping patterns, there are floods and a great need to make agriculture resilient to these shocks, he added. Mr Modi said sustainable modes of living being practised in certain traditional communities ought to be made part of school curricula and the lessons from India's efforts at adaptation in programmes such as Jal Jeevan mission, Swach Bharat mission and mission ujwala ought to be popularized globally.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-will-achieve-net-zero-emissions-by-2070/article37295810.ece

On October 29, in a different case, a Supreme Court Bench led by Justice M.R. Shah had declared that Chief Secretaries, top administrative and police officials would be held personally liable if banned varieties of firecrackers were found to be used in any of the States. “Celebration cannot be at the cost of others’ health… Nobody can be permitted to play with the life of others, more particularly that of senior citizens and children,” a Bench of Justices M.R. Shah and A.S. Bopanna had underscored. The October 29 order had come in a plea, represented by senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, that manufacturers were blatantly flouting the court’s ban on using toxic chemicals like barium salts in firecrackers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cannot-impose-blanket-ban-on-all-crackers-sc/article37295736.ece

Enough of killing ourselves with carbon. Enough of treating nature like a toilet. Enough of burning and drilling and mining our way deeper. We are digging our own graves.” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson opened the summit by urging world leaders to that they faced a damning verdict from future generations unless they acted decisively. If the leaders “fluff our lines or miss our cue”, generations as-yet unborn “will not forgive us”, he said. “The anger and the impatience of the world will be uncontainable, unless we make this COP26 in Glasgow the moment when we get real about climate change, and we can get real on coal, cars, cash and trees,” he said in a keynote speech. Mr. Johnson echoed 18-year-old climate campaigner Greta Thunberg — who is in Glasgow with thousands of other protesters — in urging the summit against indulging in “blah blah blah”. If the leaders “fluff our lines or miss our cue”, generations as-yet unborn “will not forgive us,” Mr. Johnson said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/un-countries-must-act-to-save-humanity/article37295740.ece

02 November 2021||November 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Festive season fires up October GST revenues||The highest-ever GST collections of Rs. 1.4 lakh crore was recorded in April this year, which the Ministry stressed were related to “year-end revenues”, seeking to distinguish last month’s inflows as a more robust sign of recovery. It cited several data points, including an uptick in e-way bills and the amount of taxable value as “clearly indicating the recovery in economic activity”. An increase in compliance levels in recent months have also bolstered the GST kitty, the Ministry observed, again demonstrating the same with charts showing an improvement in timely filing of GST returns by tax-payers. “In addition to action against individual tax evaders, this has been a result of the multi-pronged approach followed by the GST Council,” the Ministry noted in a statement. This included measures to ease compliance, combined with steps to “discourage non-compliant behaviour like blocking of e-way bills for non-filing of returns, system-based suspension of registration of taxpayers who have failed to file six returns in a row and blocking of credit for return defaulters”. The gross GST revenue of Rs. 1,30,127 crore comprises Rs. 23,861 crore as Central GST, State GST of Rs. 30,421 crore and Integrated GST of Rs. 67,361 crore (including Rs. 32,998 crore collected on import of goods). The GST Compensation Cess collected in the month stood at Rs. 8,484 crore, including Rs. 699 crore received on import of goods. Ms. Nayar stated, “With the October 2021 GST e-way bills expected to exceed the level seen in the previous month, the headline GST collections are slated to remain healthy in a range of Rs. 1.25-1.35 lakh crore in November”. According to Deloitte India senior director M.S. Mani if the GST collections continue to be robust in the coming months, there is a chance the government may have higher than expected collections this year. “This would provide some fiscal space to absorb the increased healthcare costs,” he said. States’ revenue growth Among the more industrial States, Gujarat and Maharashtra recorded a revenue growth of 25% and 23%, respectively. Karnataka saw an 18% growth, while Tamil Nadu and Haryana, with a large auto industry presence, reported a more subdued growth of 11% and 3%, respectively. The populous States of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar saw a healthy surge of 24% and 34%, respectively, while Odisha reported a sharp 49% uptick in revenues. Arunachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand were the only ones to record a fall in GST revenues during the month, of 52% and 1%, respectively, while revenues were unchanged for Himachal Pradesh from a year ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/festivity-fires-up-gst-revenues-to-rs-13-lakh-cr/article37295742.ece

The 980-metre-long 17.20-metre-wide flyover on Jawaharlal Nehru Salai at Koyambedu will remove a major bottleneck on that congested stretch. A large number of buses entering and exiting the CMBT due to Deepavali rush take that stretch. Built at a cost of Rs. 93.50 crore, work on the flyover began in June 2018 and had to be done in sections of 100 metres each because of heavy traffic. “A one-way was introduced at Kaliamman Koil junction during the work, hope that will be removed now.

So far, 5,65,82,981 persons have been vaccinated at government facilities, and 26,67,663 persons have taken their shots at private centres since May 1. Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan issued a note of caution to the district collectors. The number of cases began to fall only in May when people took to wearing mask, followed the physical distance norm and got themselves vaccinated. Lauding field workers He credited field workers such as sanitation staff, paramedics, nurses and doctors, workers in the local bodies, public health cadre, revenue and social welfare workers, non-governmental oganisations and elected representatives besides resident welfare associations for the drop in cases. “Unfortunately, people seem to be kicking the ladder used to overcome the challenges and are throwing caution to the winds by not following masking in public places and avoiding vaccinations, both first dose and even the second dose,” he said. Instead of suppressing the virus, the public seem to be giving it an open invitation for its resurgence, he said. “Let us realise that relaxation comes with a lot of responsibilities in the follow up of COVID appropriate behaviour and SOPs for permitted activities and also ensuring eligible persons get vaccinated. We need to approach with a lot of caution the coming days and a few more months till all eligible persons get vaccinated,” Mr. Radhakrishnan added.

02 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Health Minister urges shoppers to follow COVID-19 norms||Health Minister Ma. Subramanian on Monday launched COVID awareness campaign in crowded localities ahead of Deepavali. Speaking to media persons at Ranganathan Street in T. Nagar on Monday, Mr. Subramanian said Chief Minister M.K. Stalin had directed officials to organise awareness campaign in all crowded localities in the State ahead of the festival. “The number of cases has reduced to less than 1,000. But the risk has increased because of crowding in commercial areas. Greater Chennai Corporation Commissioner has ordered the removal of all roadside vendors of cooked food and ice cream on Ranganathan Street until Deepavali. Crowding by people who purchase food from the vendors increases the risk. We empathise with the street vendors. But we have to prevent crowding during the pandemic,” said Mr. Subramanian. Pointing to the increase in cases after the festival season in West Bengal and Kerala, Mr. Subramanian said the government was taking initiatives to prevent any increase in the number of cases after Deepavali. “The number of cases increased in Kerala after Onam. The cases increased in West Bengal after Durga Puja,” Mr. Subramanian added. “Sanitary inspectors will check the shops in crowded areas to identify workers who are yet to be vaccinated. Facilities for vaccination and testing will be provided in crowded localities such as Ranganathan Street,” said Mr. Subramanian. The Minister stressed the need for mask wearing and physical distancing in shops in crowded localities. “Parents should not bring children to crowded localities ahead of the festival season,” Mr. Subramanian said. On a day when the daily tally of COVID-19 cases fell below the 1,000 mark, there was little to celebrate as this is the third time the number fell before going up within a few weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/health-minister-urges-shoppers-to-follow-covid-19-norms/article37295959.ece

The incident occurred when Mohammed Yunus was riding a two-wheeler on the arterial Anna Salai. The vehicle skidded and the victim fell down, and was caught under the rear wheel of a Metropolitan Transport Corporation Chennai (MTC) bus. He was killed on the spot. The MTC bus (Route no. 5E) was going from Besant Nagar to Vadapalani. An official of the Guindy Traffic Investigation Wing said the motorist was killed after he hit a pothole caused by some digging work. Visuals from a CCTV in a building close to the site of the accident yielded footage on the actual sequence of events. The clip went viral on social media on Monday, with users urging that action be taken against the authorities responsible for the road with potholes. Driver arrested The Traffic Investigation police arrested bus driver L. Devaraj of Porur. The body of Yunus was sent to the Government Royapettah Hospital for post-mortem. Sources in the Highways Department said that a private telecom company had dug the road to lay cables almost three weeks after their permission expired on October 5. Not barricaded “The road was dug open on Sunday night but the company did not close the pit or cordon it off with barricades. According to the rules, the company undertaking the road-cutting has to ensure that the trench is barricaded until the work is over. We have now barricaded the location and filed a complaint with the police to take action against the firm,” said the official source.

02 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||State hikes lean period dole for fishermen families to Rs. 6,000||The State Government on Monday hiked the lean period dole given to fishermen families from Rs. 5000 to Rs. 6000 each. A total of Rs. 108 crore has been sanctioned for the purpose by Chief Minister M. K. Stalin. This was one of the election promises of the DMK. In the first phase, 1.24 lakh families living in 11 coastal districts starting from Tiruvallur to Ramanathapuram will benefit. The government has allotted Rs. 74.40 crore for this purpose and the money would be directly transferred to the respective bank accounts of the beneficiary fishermen, said an official statement here. The lean period dole is usually given during the months of October-November when fishermen cannot go out to fish in the sea due to inclement weather. Fishermen in Kanniyakumari district, which comes under the West Coast would be given this amount for the period from January to March and those in Thoothukudi, and Tirunelveli would be get it between April - May - June 2022. The government also sanctioned Rs. 135.60 crore as its share of savings schemes for fishermen and fisherwomen, who are members of cooperative societies. The amount would be deposited in the bank accounts of the society members. K. Bharathi of the South Indian Fishermen Welfare Association, who welcomed the increase, said that banks were not allowing fishermen to withdraw the amount unless both husband and wife or mother and son are physically present at the respective branch and sign the challans in front of officials. “At times those who are sick are also forced to go to the banks. ATM cards have not been issued to all beneficiaries. The Fisheries department must sit with the banks and sort out these problems,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/state-hikes-lean-period-dole-for-fishermen-families-to-rs-6000/article37295961.ece
02 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Rs. 2,000 cr. in unused funds identified: Thiaga Rajan||A special task force established by the government has identified Rs. 2,000 crore unutilised by government departments and agencies, and the sum can be returned to the treasury, Tamil Nadu Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan said on Monday. Briefing journalists at the Secretariat, he underscored the need for a mechanism to prevent idling of funds and hinted at measures like opening of a payments bank. As mentioned in the Budget for 2021-22, a special task force was constituted to reconcile, identify and access the funds of government departments, government-run societies, statutory institutions and local bodies that were kept outside the treasury within a time frame. The task force collected and collated information broadly under the categories of available balances, liabilities and to be remitted to government accounts separately under each of the closed schemes, the ongoing schemes and receipts of the departments, he explained. From the data collected, the task force traced about Rs. 1,946.31 crore that could immediately be remitted back to the government account. Mr. Thiaga Rajan said the government was incurring Rs. 1,200 crore on account of the reduction in the VAT on petrol and allocated Rs. 200 crore for ‘Illam Thedi Kalvi’ (education at the doorsteps). “Now, we have identified Rs. 2,000 crore in unutilised funds. Such an exercise will help us use funds in a better way and cut unnecessary extra expenditure.” The details of bank accounts wherein government money was parked as on March 31, 2021 were collected from banks, the Collectors, government departments and other quasi-government entities, Mr. Thiaga Rajan said. The task force conducted meetings with government departments and the State-level bankers committee to build a reliable database. “The Rs. 2,000 crore identified is just a trailer; the whole picture remains to be seen, and runs into thousands of bank accounts.” Further amounts of unutilised funds could be identified for return to the treasury. Hence, the tenure of the task force would be extended up to March 31, 2022, and the task force would be asked to do field-based audit and reconciliation. The findings would be discussed with the Chief Minister, and he would decide how to use these funds. Mr. Thiaga Rajan said the parking of funds outside the treasury was not a secret, and it had been flagged by the Comptroller and Auditor-General. The government was readying infrastructure for opening a payments bank, and would seek a licence from the Reserve Bank of India. The payments bank would help to ensure transfer of benefits directly to the beneficiary. Through the Integrated Financial and Human Resources Management System, funds from the treasury would be directly disbursed to pensioners, government employees receiving salaries, old age pensioners and scholarship recipients and final payments for works and supply of goods and services. This would prevent idling of a substantial portion of the Budget, he said. The Finance Minister said a State-level public financial management system would be implemented to track the flow of funds till they reached the beneficiary, and more funds would be given only after the sum previously released was utilised.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rs-2000-cr-in-unused-funds-identified-thiaga-rajan/article37295945.ece
02 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Schools reopen for Classes I to VIII; students welcomed to campuses with fanfare||Even the steady drizzle on Monday morning did not dampen the spirits of teachers at schools across Chennai, eagerly waiting to welcome students of Classes I-VIII back. From student brass bands to flowers and chocolates to new notebooks, students were welcomed back to the campuses amid fanfare at several schools. Schools across Tamil Nadu reopened for primary and middle classes after nearly 20 months. But steady rain in some districts, including Cuddalore, Villupuram, Kallakurichi, Tiruvarur and Vellore, led to a holiday being declared for schools. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin visited the Chennai Corporation School at Maduvankarai and inspected the safety norms. He also distributed chocolates to some primary class students. Minister for School Education Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi and Chepauk MLA Udhayanidhi Stalin visited the Panchayat School at Pethanaickanur, Pollachi, and interacted with the students there. Across schools, students had their temperature checked at the entrance. Masks were distributed to those who had not worn one. In Chennai, students at the Lady Willingdon Girls Government Model Higher Secondary School were welcomed with stationery, chocolates and geometry boxes. “Over the last one week, we had parents coming to school and enquiring with us about the arrangements in place and whether they could send their children back. Most of our parents are daily wage earners, and they are keen on sending children back to school so that they are looked after well,” said headmistress Eswari Gopalan. “I have told my son to keep wearing his mask and wash his hands regularly. Children tend to share things, and they have been asked to avoid this habit as much as possible,” said Radha, a parent whose son started Class I. Students of Classes I and II were attending in-person classes for the first time because the schools remained shut all through the previous academic year. The strength at many government and corporation schools has increased this academic year. Some schools have opted for a shift system because of a strong student strength. Kalai Selvi, headmistress, Government Primary School at Padikuppam, said that while Class V students would come to school every day, those of the other classes would return to the campus thrice a week. “Students of Classes I-III will be in school on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and students of Classes II and IV will be there on the other days,” she said. Some private schools reopened the middle classes on Monday. They plan to decide on calling primary students back to the campus later this month since they have online classes now. K. Manoharan, principal, SBOA School, said his school reopened the middle classes, and would have primary students back on the campus after November 8. “We had 20% of the middle class students who had concerns about returning. For them, the school will run online classes...”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/schools-reopen-for-classes-i-to-viii-students-welcomed-to-campuses-with-fanfare/article37295943.ece
02 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Court verdict unacceptable, says Ramadoss||PMK founder S. Ramadoss on Monday urged the Tamil Nadu Government to appeal in the Supreme Court against the Madras High Court’s verdict declaring the 10.5% internal reservation for the Vanniyars unconstitutional. In a statement, he termed the verdict “unacceptable” because such questions were not raised by the Madras High Court or the Supreme Court against the internal reservation provided to the Muslims or the Arundhathiyars in Tamil Nadu. He said Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, “who has understood the need for such a quota despite the fact that the law was passed by the previous [AIADMK] government”, has the “duty and responsibility” to reinstate it through legal and political steps. “Lakhs of Vanniyars have been admitted to educational institutions and have taken up jobs through this quota. The High Court has not taken their future into account,” he said. Dr. Ramadoss said all the measures for reservation, taken thus far, were based on the caste census undertaken in 1931 and the data that the Backward Class Commissions had compiled from the 1931 caste census. “It is based on these data that the 10.5% reservation was created for the Vanniyars. The questions raised in the verdict go against social justice. They could pose a threat to the reservation for the other communities, too. The State Government must prepare a strong response to the questions,” he said. He said the opponents of social justice had raised similar questions over the 69% reservation in Tamil Nadu, but the Supreme Court rejected their contentions in 2010. Cadre held Meanwhile, a group of PMK cadre was arrested in Tiruchi and Ariyalur on Monday for staging road blockades against the Madras High Court verdict. They were subsequently released. TVK’s reaction The State Government should appeal against the Madras High Court verdict, Tamizhaga Vazhvurimai Katchi leader T. Velmurugan said in Coimbatore. Addressing reporters at the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, he felt the verdict seemed to suggest that the court’s understanding of the idea of ensuring social justice by giving the 10.5% reservation was not complete.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/court-verdict-unacceptable-says-ramadoss/article37295948.ece

Stalin on Monday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, flagging the issue of delays in the payment of wages under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). He requested Mr. Modi to release the funds. “The MGNREGS is considered a stable livelihood opportunity in rural areas and the present delay in wage payment is causing hardship to several thousands of rural households. It may make them to disown the scheme and lead to urban migration for employment opportunities,” Mr. Stalin said. Fully utilised The entire amount of Rs. 3,524.69 crore released by the Government of India to Tamil Nadu during FY 2021-22 had been fully utilised by crediting it into the workers’ accounts up to September 15, he said. Since then, no further funds had been released towards wages by Government of India, which led to a wage liability of Rs. 1,178.12 crore up to November 1, he pointed out. “As you are aware, it is one of the largest social security programmes that provides a maximum of 100 days of unskilled manual work to every household in rural areas,” the Chief Minister said. He reiterated that funds towards wage payments may be released immediately, particularly considering the festival season.

02 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Many in CM’s Economic Advisory Council not for cut in VAT on petrol||Many global experts in the Chief Minister Economic Advisory Council felt that the reduction in the VAT on petrol by the Tamil Nadu Government was not an impactful way to use the State’s scarce financial sources, Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan said on Monday. “We are the only State to have cut the tax on petrol so far this year. There have been two sides to the debate. The experts in the Council said that with only one State cutting the tax, people from other States could cross the borders and take advantage. Tamil Nadu is among the States that have the highest vehicular traffic,” he said. Mr. Thiaga Rajan pointed out that the Council had made several important recommendations that the government acted upon. These included the expansion of the old age pension scheme, ‘Illam Thedi Kalvi’ to tackle learning loss among students due to COVID-19 and special packages for micro, small and medium businesses. The Government would extend guarantee for the loans lent to these companies, he said. The Minister said the Council had supported the Government’s initiatives in data-centric governance and submitted some good suggestions. As part of the initiative, the beneficiary-linked databases of large government programmes such as the public distribution system and the old age pension scheme were being analysed by the Tamil Nadu e-Governance Agency. The databases, such as the Civil Registration System that maintains the records of births and deaths, could help to carry over additions (to the families) and deletions (on account of deaths) directly to the family card database, he said. Such an approach would eliminate the possibility of deceased persons receiving old age pension and monthly allocation of rice under the public distribution system — “instances of which we have discovered during the review over the past few months”, he said. An analysis of crop and jewel loan data from the co-operative banks led to several irregularities having been unearthed. Among them was the case of one person having taken multiple loans from multiple societies for the same small piece of agricultural land, he said. At some places, jewel loans were given without any jewel having been pledged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/many-in-cms-economic-advisory-council-not-for-cut-in-vat-on-petrol/article37295946.ece

An advisory from the Secretary, Environment, Forest and Climate Change, also mentioned a list of don’ts: avoid bursting of joined (serial) crackers which created huge noise pollution; avoid bursting of crackers in ‘silence areas’ such as hospitals, schools, courts and religious places; and avoid bursting of crackers near huts and fire-prone areas. It also advised people to celebrate the festival responsibly so that their action did not pollute the environment. It also recalled that the Supreme Court, ruling in a case in 2018, directed that crackers be made only with raw materials that would cut emissions.

Raja M. Shanmugham, president of the association, said in a press release that after deliberating the issue of the recent spurt in yarn prices, it was decided to suggest to all its members to avoid panic buying of cotton yarn. Most units will either close or scale down production for a couple of weeks because of the festival season. Cotton arrivals for the current season will also pick up after that. Hence, the units should slow down yarn purchase now. The government should ban export of cotton or cotton yarn and abolish import duty on cotton. The association also urged its members to talk to their overseas buyers and seek a price increase from them as high input costs are felt globally.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/garment-manufacturers-told-to-slow-down-yarn-purchase/article37295993.ece
02 November 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Farmers oppose move to establish industrial estate||Farmers in Akkarai Chengapalli, Kuppanur, Vadakkalur, Pogalur and other villages in and around Annur and Mettupalayam taluks petitioned the Coimbatore district administration at the weekly grievances redress meeting on Monday, opposing the proposed industrial estate. In their petitions, the farmers said the State Government’s move to establish the industrial estate by acquiring 3,800 acre from farmers was unwarranted as none of the farmers had demanded an industrial park. In fact, the farmers in the villages faced labour shortage and were meeting the demand by employing persons from north Indian states. If the Government were to go ahead to establish the industrial estate and then sell the lands to industrialists, the farmers would fight it tooth and nail, the petitioners added and demanded that the Government scrap the move. Financial help sought Parents of a six-month-old infant from Kavundampalayam on Monday petitioned the district administration for financial help.

02 November 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||State must make use of TNAU expertise to improve agriculture, says Governor||The State Government should make optimum use of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University to improve agriculture, Governor-Chancellor R.N. Ravi said in Coimbatore on Monday at the University’s 42nd convocation. The Government should start looking at the University as a precious asset because the latter’s beneficiaries were farmers. It should make optimum use of the institution and respond to its difficulties and concerns. The University, in turn, should be technically competent and emotionally involved in identifying problems of farmers from across the State, he said and called for greater cooperation between the two. Preparing farmers for the impact of climate change was a challenge the University faced. Changing monsoon pattern, rising sea level, deadly heat wave and intense storms posed threat to agriculture. As a first step to tackle the challenge, the Central Government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had recently launched 35 crop varieties, developed by ICAR institutions. It had earlier released 17 biofortified varieties of eight crops. Mr. Ravi said he was happy to note that the University’s contribution towards increasing farmers income was Rs. 10,443 crore a year. It had helped farmers earn Rs. 5,029 crore through its crop varieties, Rs. 4,863 crore through management technologies and Rs. 541 crore through farm machineries. Department of Agricultural Research and Education Secretary and Director General, Indian Council of Agricultural Research, Trilochan Mohapatra said the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University stood first among State agricultural universities in generating revenue. It had earned Rs. 125 crore while other universities earned less than Rs. 78 crore. It was time to focus on logistics, storage and transportation of agricultural produce as the country had attained self-sufficiency in production. They were crucial for transforming agriculture into a profitable venture, as farmers at present suffered Rs. 92,651 crore loss a year due to post-harvest losses. Mr. Mohapatra also said it was time for the University to devise strategies for better use of rainwater for agriculture. It should respond to Mr Modi’s call for ‘more crop per drop’ and also take steps to develop new technologies in drip irrigation and fertigation because 45% land under cultivation in the State was rain-fed. It was all the more necessary for the University to work on water management. He congratulated the Vice-Chancellor and faculty for taking the University from the 33rd position to 8th position in the university rank list. Earlier, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University Vice-Chancellor N. Kumar welcomed the gathering and highlighted the University’s achievements in the last year. As many as 2,602 candidates received gold medals and awards from Governor Mr. Ravi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/make-use-of-tnau-expertise-to-improve-agriculture/article37295965.ece

According to Ayyaru Gopalakrishnan, assistant professor, “The MCRV virus had already severely affected the Chinese mud crab industry during an outbreak in 2007. This particular virus has been identified by RT-PCR, transmission electron microscopic and infectivity studies. The reo-viral particles were non-enveloped, icosahedral in shape and there is no clear evidence of spike-like structures on the surface organised in a crystalline manner. The average size of the viral particles is about 70 nm (nanometer).” Mud crabs have a high export value, both live and as meat. Mr. Gopalakrishnan pointed out that this is the first instance of a reovirus outbreak in mud crabs in the country. The emergence of MCRV in India will have a significant impact on crab production. According to the study, the virus is highly pathogenic and results in 100% mortality within 10 to 20 days. According to Prof. M. Srinivasan, dean and director of the Faculty of Marine Sciences, the prevalence of the outbreak is being monitored regularly by the said team. Investigations are on to identify the source of the virus, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/viral-disease-identified-in-mud-crabs-in-pichavaram-facility/article37296342.ece

02 November 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Mattutthavani-bound buses diverted to ease traffic flow||Madurai City Traffic Police have diverted buses proceeding from Goripalayam junction to MGR Integrated Bus Stand at Mattuthavani through Gandhi Museum Road to avoid traffic congestion on Gokhale Road where the ramp for the elevated corridor on New Natham Road is being constructed. The diversion was effected from Monday, bringing relief to Deepavali shoppers. Buses coming from Goripalayam junction must take a right turn from Gokhale Road on Tirumukkulam South Lane and reach Alagarkoil Road and again take a right turn to reach Tamukkam bus stop. “Since, all the three roads - Gokhale Road, Tirumukkulam South Street and Alagarkoil Road - are one way, the drivers of buses do not face any inconvenience in taking the diverted route,” a senior traffic police official said. Besides, metal barricades have been placed on the Alagarkoil Road junction to segregate vehicles coming from Outpost and Gokhale Road. From Tamukkam bus stop, the buses will take a left turn into Gandhi Museum Road and go through Dr. Thangaraj Salai to reach Melur Road at the roundabout near District Court Complex. This way the buses need to skip only the Vishaal de Mal and Outpost (old university) bus stops. However, passengers who want to alight at these bus stops can take other buses proceeding towards Oomachikulam (New Natham Road) and K. Pudur (Alagarkoil Road). The new arrangement has eased traffic congestion on Gokhale Road ahead of IOC roundabout to a great extent as two-wheelers, autorickshaws and cars can have more carriage space, at a time when the volume of traffic is high in the last few days ahead of Deepavali. As many as 1,000 buses, including mofusil buses, have been diverted. The option of diverting the buses through Panagal Road from Goripalayam was not explored as it would mean the buses had to skip four bus stops - Tamukkam, Tallakulam, Vishaal de Mal and Outpost, he added.

02 November 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Kerala has been creating hurdles for Tamil Nadu: OPS||The Kerala Government has been creating hurdles and preventing Tamil Nadu from storing water up to 142 feet in the Mullaperiyar dam as per the Supreme Court order and the ruling DMK is ignoring it, charged AIADMK coordinator O. Panneerselvam on Monday. After chairing a meeting of party functionaries in Madurai, Mr. Panneerselvam said the party would soon launch a massive protest in five southern districts to ensure the “lifeline of farmers” in those districts is protected. Former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa had fetched the right to Tamil Nadu to increase water level to 142 feet in the century-old reservoir in Idukki district of Kerala after a prolonged legal battle, he said. The Supreme Court had allowed Tamil Nadu to increase the water level to 142 feet after taking up strengthening works of the Baby dam, he added. “Water level in the reservoir was taken up to (the permitted) 142 feet for three successive years,” he recalled. The dam water has been the lifeline of Theni, Dindigul, Madurai, Sivaganga and Ramanathapuram districts for irrigation and drinking water purpose. However, the Kerala Government was putting spokes into Tamil Nadu's efforts in storing water up to 142 feet and the DMK government was overlooking it, he alleged. Senior party leaders Dindigul C. Sreenivasan, Natham R. Viswanathan, Sellur K. Raju, V. V. Rajan Chellappa and R. B. Udhayakumar, were among those who participated in the discussion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kerala-preventing-tn-from-storing-water-up-to-142-feet-in-dam-says-panneerselvam/article37295964.ece

02 November 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Deferred sexennial elections to be held on Nov. 7||The twice-deferred elections to choose people's representatives of the French living abroad will now be held on November 7. The sexennial elections afford French citizens living abroad across the world the means to elect their representatives, called ‘councillors for the French living abroad’, or advisers. In southern India, the elections involve French citizens residing in the Union Territory of Puducherry, apart from Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Three seats are to be filled for this constituency. There are an estimated 4,600 voters, a majority of them, in the Union Territory. The five candidates in the fray head six-member ‘lists’ of nominees and each make their case with distinct manifestoes. The elections, held once in six years, were originally scheduled for 2020 with candidates even commencing campaigning, but got postponed because of the pandemic. It was rescheduled again from May 30 this year. “We had already chosen this idea of change last year, to address the French community because this was the feedback we received from the persons we have been in touch with or who came to us,” said Chantal Samuel-David, who is a candidate with a list of six nominees representing the ‘Unis pour le Changement’ (United for Change). Under the unique electoral system that provides special representation for the French citizens living abroad, there are 442 representatives worldwide for French living abroad, or “councillors for French living abroad”. In turn, these councillors form part of an electoral college that vote for the representation of French citizens abroad at the Assembly of French Citizens Abroad and for members of the Senat, or the French Parliament’s upper house. Among the four regions, Asia is represented by 93 councillors. India consists of two electoral districts — one in the north of India and another in the south. In the southern constituency, there are 3 seats to be filled and the voters are the French citizens registered on the consular voter list and residing in Union Territory of Puducherry, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andaman, Nicobar and Lakshwadeep. There are 4,629 voters in the southern constituency. According to Ms. Samuel-David, what is quite special about these elections, is the stipulation that all lists of candidates should have perfect gender parity. The role of these councillors is to assist French citizens on day-to-day issues (education, health, security, retirement, etc) and to represent them before the French Consulate and the French authorities. This year, the other candidates heading the lists of six nominees are ‘The Experience at the Heart of the French’ led by Prédibane Siva, ‘The Solidarity and Ecocitoyen Movement of Pondichery, Tamil Nadu and Kerala’, a list that proclaims the support of the Europe Ecologie Les Verts, and is headed by Audrey Pelerin, ‘the Solidarity Alliance of the French of Pondichery’, led by Tirougnanasambandare Siva and ‘Together for Progress’, led by Balaramin Bichat. The French community is getting more and more diverse and expectations and demands have also evolved, says Ms. Samuel-David. Though from diverse backgrounds, her nominees have been engaged in social work, and together hope to represent the voice of the community through the Consulate or through other French administrations. Candidates have appealed to voters to turn out at one of the six polling booths in south India. Voting has been scheduled from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. There are four booths in Puducherry and one each in Chennai and Karaikal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/deferred-sexennial-elections-to-be-held-on-nov-7/article37296333.ece

02 November 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||Call for a noiseless, smoke-free Deepavali||The State government has made an appeal to the people to celebrate a noiseless, smoke-free and safe Deepavali this year also. In a press release issued here on Monday, the Information and Public Relations Officer, Thanjavur, said Deepavali was one of the important festivals celebrated in the country. Wearing of clothes, distribution of sweets and bursting of crackers with colourful lights was customary for many generations. However, bursting of crackers had a negative impact on the lives of people and the environment and the Supreme Court, while disposing a PIL seeking ban on the production and sale of crackers in October 2018, had instructed the manufacture crackers using raw materials that would reduce emission besides directing the manufactures to switch over to production of Green crackers. It had also urged the officials to create adequate awareness of air and noise pollution caused due to bursting of crackers and encourage the community to burst crackers at a particular place and period of time. Hence, like in the previous years, the State government granted permission to the people to burst crackers between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. and from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. this year. At the same time, the revellers were advised to avoid bursting of serial crackers as it created huge noise and not to burst crackers near hospitals, schools, courts, religious places, huts and other fire-prone areas.

02 November 2021||THENI,TAMIL NADU||Farmers plan padayatra to Mullaperiyar dam||About 5,000 farmers from five southern districts — Theni, Dindigul, Madurai, Sivaganga and Ramanathapuram — plan to take out a padayatra from Theni to Mullaperiyar on November 12, to draw the attention of the Tamil Nadu government to save the reservoir, said S. Rajasekar, president of the farmers’ associations of those districts, here on Monday. The well-attended meeting by various farmers’ associations submitted a memorandum to District Collector K.V. Muralidharan. Speaking to reporters, the farmers’ leaders said the State government should in no way dilute the 1979 agreement entered with Kerala. When it had been the practice of the Tamil Nadu government to announce the water release for irrigation ahead of the cultivation, it was shocking to learn that the Kerala government had “released” water in the presence of their Ministers and the Idukki District Collector. When reporters said that it was the Tamil Nadu government which had released water, the farmers’ leader shot back: “Why would the State PWD engineers release water in the presence of Kerala Ministers and officials? When the Supreme Court had directed authorities to maintain water level at 142 feet until the next hearing on Nov. 11, what was the need for the Tamil Nadu government officials to violate it?” They said they would definitely make a mention about the violation before the apex court. They urged Chief Minister M. K. Stalin to protect the farmers and clarify on the issue. The Theni Collector should visit the dam every week or at least twice a month. The Tamil Nadu government staff and officers at the Mullaperiyar dam site should be given protection and the Theni SP should be authorised to have control of the dam on the security point of view. The memorandum said the farmers should be nominated in the committee which held talks with the Kerala government. Along with the PWD engineers, farmers’ representatives should be part of the inspection teams. When over 100 farmers led by S.R. Thevar, Anwar Balasingam, Ponkatchi Kannan, Saleth and Loganathan went by private vehicles to Lower Camp, they were stopped near Uthamapalayam by the police. After staging a demonstration, they returned to Theni, the police said. The demonstrators urged the Theni Collector to take full charge of the dam and release of water should not be done under any circumstances until it reached 142 feet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-plan-padayatra-to-mullaperiyar-dam/article37295996.ece

02 November 2021||Thoothukudi,TAMIL NADU||Students of Classes I to VIII go to school after 18 months||After about 18 months, children studying in Classes I to VIII turned up on Monday as the schools reopened. The COVID-19 pandemic, which surfaced in March 2020, forced the Tamil Nadu government to issue a lockdown and all educational institutions were closed. When the situation improved, the officials from the Health Department relaxed with certain regulations. The government had instructed the authorities to adhere to Standard Operating Procedures. When cases started declining, the government, which had already reopened schools for higher classes, directed the authorities to open classes for children from Standard I to VIII. Chief Minister M. K. Stalin had instructed all Ministers, MLAs and MPs to welcome the children at the respective schools on Monday. Minister Geetha Jeevan visited a Corporation school in Thoothukudi and welcomed the children with sweets. She also distributed notebooks and pencil for the students on the occasion. The chief education officer Baladandayuthapani said that 2,10,638 students were enrolled from 1-8 standards in the district. The district has 1,221 primary, 304 middle, 111 high and 218 higher secondary schools. As a precautionary measure, all Headmasters, Headmistress and senior teachers and non-teaching staff had kept the campuses clean since the last one week. In some schools, the teachers had decorated the classrooms with balloons and organised bands to welcome the children. Residents in Pandarampatti village in Thoothukudi district had arranged ‘thavil’ players and garlanded the children. The objective of the celebrations was to create motivation and remove the fear that revolved among some students and their parents about COVID-19. The first day mostly was spent to recall the activities done by the children at their homes. Only after Deepavali, the regular classes would go on in full swing, a teacher with a Corporation school said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/students-of-classes-i-to-viii-go-to-school-after-18-months/article37296370.ece
02 November 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||After 20 months at home, students eagerly return to schools||Physical classes for students of Classes 1 to 8 resumed after a gap of over 20 months. The schools closed down in March last as a precautionary measure against COVID-19. Teachers of many government schools in Tiruchi city made an effort to make the day memorable for the children and gave them a warm welcome. With rain expected over the next few days, and the upcoming Deepavali, teachers were unsure of the students' attendance but were happy with the turnout. About 70% students returned to the schools, while the rest are expected to attend after Deepavali, officials said. The School Education Department has instructed teachers to engage students in activities such as singing and dancing for a period of two weeks before regular learning begins. School managements have been requested to divide the students into groups and conduct physical classes on alternate days. At Subbiah Memorial Middle School at Tennur, students offered prayers and broke 108 coconuts before entering the school. “At 8.30 a.m., there was no sign of any student. The sky was overcast and I presumed that they would not come and went to my office. However, by 9 a.m., at least 75% of the students had arrived,” K.S. Jeevanandhan, Headmaster, told The Hindu . In a similar way, K. Asha Devi, Headmistress at Panchayat Union Middle School, Pirattiyur, who recently bagged the National Award for Teachers given by the Union Ministry of Educatio, arranged for crowns and garlands for all her students. Drums and music were also arranged to welcome the students with song and dance. “I was feeling bored at home, and was not able to meet my friends as I had to stay with my grandparents in my village. I am happy that the school has reopened,” R. Sarathi Sree, a student, said. Parents too were happy to drop their children at the schools. “They were restless at home. Children this age need to learn social behaviour,” a parent said. Admissions to government schools across the district has increased. At the Corporation Middle School in Subramaniapuram, the admissions had risen to 240, from 80 last year. “Students from private schools in the locality have enrolled their children here. We believe that we can provide the students with education on par with them,” a teacher at the school said. Teachers have been instructed to ensure that the students wear masks at all times. Schools have been instructed to stock up on additional masks and keep sanitisers in every classroom while ensuring that social distancing is maintained between the students. Thanjavur, Tiruvarur Regular schooling for students from class 1 to 8 in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts commenced on a happy note with declaration of partial and full day holiday for schools on November 1. Students in Thanjavur district were overjoyed with double treat of a warm welcome with sweets when then entered their institutions and the subsequent announcement of holiday in the afternoon. The reopening of schools in Tiruvarur too began on a similar note with the district administration declaring a holiday for schools in view of inclement weather. Meanwhile, enquiry revealed that a moderate turnout was recorded in schools in Thanjavur district presumably due to School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi’s recent statement that parents were free to send their children to the schools on the reopening day or after the Deepavali festivities were over since insistence of strict attendance was not viable during the pandemic period. The elected representatives of the ruling party welcomed the students at select schools in their constituencies by distributing sweets and wishing them a good academic year. Inspecting the reopening of schools, Collector Dinesh Ponraj Oliver exhorted the school authorities to educate the students about the pandemic situation and ensure that the COVID-19 SoP was adhered to without fail in classrooms and as well as on the school premises. A group of 35 students of the Panchayat Union Primary School at Panancheri in Peravurani taluk received a VIP welcome at their school on Monday. Shawls were presented to them by the Headmaster, Veera. Chandrasekaran in addition to sweets and balloons. Earlier, a parent of a school student dressed as Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar went to the residences of other students in the village along with a group of teachers and parent-teacher association members and and invited the students to attend their schools.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/after-20-months-at-home-students-eagerly-return-to-schools/article37296050.ece

The Telugu Desam Party, the Congress, the CPI and other parties extended support to the farmers. Former Union Minister Renuka Chowdhury drove a tractor, as the farmers marched on, and extended solidarity with them.  680-day stir For over 680 days now, farmers in the Amaravati region have been continuing the agitation opposing the Jagan Mohan Reddy government’s move to trifurcate the State capital. They are also fighting a legal battle on the issue. Mr. Reddy had earlier reiterated that the decision to have separate seats of governance at Amaravati (legislative capital), Visakhapatnam (executive or administrative) and Kurnool (judicial) was aimed at balanced development of all regions. The farmers, who reportedly parted with over 33,000 acres of their fertile land for the construction of Andhra Pradesh’s new capital, have now undertaken the padayatra to Tirumala, the abode of Lord Venkateswara, to press their demand for retaining Amaravati as the sole capital of the State. The foot march will traverse through over 70 villages in Guntur, Prakasam, SPS Nellore and Chittoor districts before reaching Tirupati on December 17.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-begin-court-to-temple-march/article37295775.ece
02 November 2021||November 02 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Vanniyar quota law unconstitutional, says High Court||When the entire Most Backward Classes were enjoying 20% reservation, this caste alone was given 10.5%. This would affect the prospects of the others, it said. The government had not considered the caste-wise population, and there was no data available with the government to invoke the provision in the Constitution to provide internal reservation. There was nothing on record to establish that the government had held deliberations with all stakeholders, especially the communities that would be affected by the Act, the court said. The court observed that by virtue of the 102nd Constitutional Amendment, the powers of the Assembly to include and exclude the Backward Classes was bestowed on Parliament. But the 105th Constitutional Amendment restored the power of the States to identify and notify the Backward Classes. The 102nd Amendment came into existence on August 11, 2018, and the 105th Amendment was enacted on August 19, 2021. The court held that on the date of its enactment, February 26, 2021, the State legislature had no power to pass such legislation. The Tamil Nadu Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Reservation of Seats in Educational Institutions and of Appointments or Posts in the Services under the State) Act, 1993, was brought in to protect the 69% quota. Since the Act providing 20% undivided reservation for the MBCs was in force, without its being amended, the Act providing internal reservation went against the constitutional provisions, the court said. The court said it was a settled position of law that caste alone could not be the basis for any classification. Therefore, the reservation by virtue of the Act on the basis of the caste was untenable in law.   When the entire Most Backward Classes were enjoying 20% reservation, this caste alone was given 10.5%. This would affect the prospects of the others||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vanniyar-quota-law-unconstitutional-says-high-court/article37295953.ece

02 November 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Rajyotsava celebrated across Belagavi district||Rajyotsava was celebrated across Belagavi district in government and private offices and schools and colleges on Monday. District in-charge Minister Govind Karjol hoisted the national flag and felicitated achievers in various fields at the CPED Grounds Stadium. He recalled the contribution of journalists, activists and writers to the cause of unification of the State. Felicitations He felicitated activists Ramesh Sontakki, Padmaraj Vaijannanavar, Tippeswami, Ganesh Rokhade, Balu Udagatti and Shivanagouda Patil, journalists Shreeshail Mathad, Srikant Kubakaddi, Kiran Malennanavar, Kuntinath Kalamani, Rajashekar Patil, Vilas Joshi, Sunita Desai and Mahantesh Gaddishettihalli, artists Yadavendra Pujari, Holeppa Nesaragi, Shivalinga Karavinakoppa and Brahmananda Basaragi, environmentalist Firoz Chahus, sportsperson Malaprabha Jadhav, social workers Sunil Neginal and Channabasayya Kathapurimath, writers Ramakrishna Marathe, Nagaraj Murugod and Asha Kadapatti. Despite the express ban on processions and public celebrations, Kannada enthusiasts gathered in large numbers at the Rani Channamma Circle here to celebrate Rajyotsava. Hundreds of youth gathered in the circle for hours, waved flags, shouted slogans and danced to popular numbers. Black Day Meanwhile, Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti leaders gathered at the Maratha Mandal to observe Rajyotsava as Black Day. Shubham Shelke, youth wing leader, said that linguistic division of States has given the right to people who spoke various languages to join various regions. “This is a Constitutional right and we will get it,” he said. Manohar Kinekar urged political parties in Maharashtra to join the MES struggle for merger of the region with Maharashtra. “Even if they don’t support us, we will continue to agitate,” he said. He said that the Karnataka Government was imposing Kannada on non-Kannada speakers which was a violation of the fundamental right of linguistic minorities. The former Mayor Sarita Patil said that national parties are fast losing loyal followers and are trying to recruit MES cadre instead. She challenged “so-called nationalist and Hindutva professing parties’’ to hoist the saffron flag over the city corporation building. Participants wore black badges and held placards with slogans against the Karnataka Government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rajyotsava-celebrated-across-belagavi-district/article37296091.ece

02 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||No more RC smart cards for new vehicles||After issuing smart cards for registration certificates (RCs) for over 12 years, the Transport Department will do away with the exercise in the future. Instead of smart cards, owners of new vehicles will get their RCs in a digitised format and printed on paper. On Monday, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai launched 30 contactless online services related to the Transport Department. Among the services, the prominent ones are registration of new vehicles (non-transport) at the dealer point, issuing of learning licence, transfer of ownership, temporary registration certificate, and issuing of international driving permit. Rajender Kumar Kataria, Principal Secretary of Transport Department told The Hindu , that doing away with physical verification for registration of new vehicles is a major change. ‘Physical verification’ “Earlier, the RTOs were insisting on physical verification of vehicles prior to registration. This was causing inconvenience to vehicle owners. Now, dealers can register the vehicles by filling forms online and paying tax without producing the vehicle for inspection. Allotment of registration number happens online. The timeline for registration of vehicles will get drastically reduced in the coming days,” he said. ‘Digital format’ Asked what will happen to RC smart cards that have been issued by the department for over a decade, he said, “As per the rules specified for the Central Government, RCs should be made available through the digital format. When law enforcement authorities ask, they can be produced through DigiLocker or printed RC. There is no need for issuing existing smart cards for RC. However, the smart card for driving licences continue to be issued.” The Transport Department launched smart cards for driving licences and RCs in 2009, but it has hardly been of any use as enforcing authorities do not have the readers available with them to read the chip card that are inserted in these smart cards. Use of paper In addition, the online services will reduce use of papers drastically at RTOs. Every year, more than 12 lakh vehicles get registered in the State and 23 to 25 lakh people apply for learning licences and lakhs of people go to RTOs for various other services. “Till now, files are getting piled up at RTOs. Each file would have at least six papers, basically photocopies of various documents such as Aadhaar, vehicle documents, and others. When we shift to online, paper consumption gets reduced. Providing 30 online services will result in saving crores of sheets of paper,” Mr. Kataria said. He added that the Central Government facilitated RTO services through Sarathi and Vahan categories. “Provisions have been made to provide certain services on online mode where the general public need not visit the RTOs. The administrative reforms committee formed by the State Government too had recommended providing certain services online and the department is implementing them,” he said, adding that Delhi, Odisha, and Madhya Pradesh have already introduced many online services pertaining to the Transport Department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-more-rc-smart-cards-for-new-vehicles/article37295889.ece
02 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Close to 4,500 vacancies in Forest Dept.||The State Government has admitted that there are close to 4,500 vacancies in the Karnataka Forest Department (KFD), leading to questions about the functioning of the department at a time, when there are huge concerns over forest cover and threats to such areas. During the recently concluded session, Forest Minister Umesh V. Katti, responding to a question, said the KFD had 4,444 vacant posts. Of these, 2,743 were in Group C, 1,455 in Group D, 145 in Group B, and 101 in Group A. According to the annual report of the KFD for 2020-21, in addition to the territorial, wildlife and social forestry units, the department has functional units such as Working Plan, Research, Training, Evaluation, Vigilance, ICT cell, and Mobile Squads. “The total staff strength in the department is 13,244, of which 8,948 are filled and 4,296 are vacant. The number of daily wage staff working under Karnataka Daily Wage Employees Welfare Rules -2013 is 3,285,” the report said. Forest areas and duties According to the report, the total recorded forest area in the State is 41,590.16 sqkm. The State has a network of protected areas with five national parks, 33 wildlife sanctuaries (including five tiger reserves), 14 conservation reserves, and one community reserve. The work carried out by the department can be broadly classified into the following categories: regulatory, protection, conservation, and sustainable management, the report added. While regulatory functions include enforcing provisions of various legislations such as the Karnataka Forest Act 1963, the Wildlife Protection Act 1972, Forest (Conservation) Act 1980, the Karnataka Preservation of Trees Act 1976, protection functions include boundary consolidation, protection of forest areas from encroachment, illicit-felling, mitigation of human-wildlife conflict, undertaking fire prevention, and control measures. Conservation functions include taking up plantation works, soil-moisture conservation, and watershed development works for water security, conservation of rare, endangered and threatened species and conducting awareness activities. ‘Functioning affected’ Conservationists point out to the dangers of having such a large number of vacancies. “The functioning of the department is affected. They are crucial for so many activities: fire prevention, anti poaching, protection, tiger census, etc. Forest guards should not be doubling up and doing other duties and focus on protection alone. It is high time that the KFD writes to the finance department and fills up vacancies,” said a conservationist. Forest Department officials were unavailable for comment. However, Mr. Katti, in his response, had said that for every 500 to 1,500 hectares, there is one forest guard. There is no proposal to increase this number, instead the focus will be on filling existing vacancies, he had said. He had also said that the recruitment process for appointing 339 forest guards began in March 2020 and the process was on.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/close-to-4500-vacancies-in-forest-dept/article37295898.ece
02 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Aggressive testing suggested in Bengaluru, Hangal, and Sindgi||With total failure of all COVID-19 protocols in the past four days during the final journey of the late Kannada actor Puneeth Rajkumar, experts say there should be aggressive and increased testing of all symptomatic people in Bengaluru in the next fortnight. Karnataka’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) had, on October 10, recommended revision of testing targets keeping in mind the Test Positivity Rate (TPR), seven-day average of effective Reproduction Number (Rt No.), and the ensuing fairs and festivals in October-November. Recommending a total daily target of 1.1 lakh till November, the TAC had suggested that 50,000 tests should be conducted daily in Bengaluru and 60,000 in the rest of Karnataka. Half of the 60,000 should be in the border districts, the TAC had said. However, the daily testing targets have not been met on all days. Now, with huge crowds turning up to pay their respects to the late actor, experts say there is fear of a fresh outbreak of COVID-19. “The next fortnight is crucial as it was difficult to ensure COVID-19 protocols were followed in the past four days in Bengaluru. It was beyond anyone’s control. There should be aggressive testing of all symptomatic people in the city for at least two weeks,” TAC chairman M.K. Sudarshan told The Hindu on Monday. “At least 50,000 tests should be conducted daily in the city compulsorily. Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT) can be done for all symptomatic people and those who test negative should be followed up with RT-PCR test as per ICMR protocols. Testing can also be done through pooled samples in a 1:5 ratio,” Dr. Sudarshan said.  He said testing should also be ramped up in the two constituencies — Hangal and Sindgi — where bypolls were held. “There, testing should be increased by 20%. All symptomatic people, not just those who visit a healthcare facility but also those who buy medicines from pharmacies over the counter, should be tested.” “The issue was discussed at last week’s TAC meeting. All pharmacies should keep a record of the phone numbers of those who buy medicines for fever, cough and cold, and report to the health authorities. Such people should be contacted and tested,” Dr. Sudarshan said. C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, who is also part of the TAC, said random samples should be drawn from those in closed markets, shopkeepers, caterers, restaurant staff, and home delivery and housekeeping personnel. Street vendors and people in railway stations and bus stands should also be randomly tested. This is mainly because people from all walks of life attended the funeral, he said. “Testing is the only way we can keep our Test Positivity Rateunder check. We should continue tracing, tracking and testing a minimum of 1:20 contacts as per the guidelines. No one with symptoms of ILI, SARI and other respiratory diseases should be left out now,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/aggressive-testing-suggested-in-bengaluru-hangal-and-sindgi/article37295917.ece
02 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Delay in getting luggage irks passengers||A breakdown in the baggage handling system disrupted flight services for the second straight day on Monday at the Kempegowda International Airport. Passengers complained that they waited for hours near the baggage belt after landing at the airport to collect their belongings. On the other hand, those who had travelled on Sunday from Bengaluru to various destinations continued to vent their ire on social media alleging IndiGo failed to deliver missing luggage. Many passengers said that they did not get their luggage even after 12 to 20 hours. Amijit Hazarika, who travelled from Bengaluru to Goa, said after reaching Goa, he found that his luggage was left at Bengaluru. “I just have my T-shirt and jeans with me now. No response from IndiGo Goa call centre. Where is my luggage?” his tweet read. People who had gone to their home towns to celebrate the festivals are disappointed with the delay in delivery of luggages. Amit Jha, in his complaint to the airline, said, “Very disappointed by the service. People are travelling for celebrating Diwali/Chhath. Check-in baggage is missing!” Vardaan Sharma, who travelled from Bengaluru to Chandigarh, said, “I have filled out the PIR form but have not heard anything since. It is difficult to manage only with the clothes on my back. Any update would be appreciated.” Shalini Sahu, who had not received her luggage, said, “We need the clarity of whether the luggage is coming today or not. We were promised yesterday that we will get our stuff max by today morning. There has been no update. What is the ETA. People have important stuff stranded with you.” IndiGo replied to the aggrieved passengers by saying: “Due to baggage belt failure at Bengaluru airport, there are bags that are left behind and our team is working on priority to get those delivered at the earliest.” Ramesh B.H., who had planned for a trip to Rameswaram, said, “We had the materials needed for the rituals to be performed in Rameswaram. We had our clothes, medicines and other essentials in the bag. The plan of going to Rameswaram got cancelled. We paid an extra day of rent for our room.” In a statement, Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) said that a technical issue in the baggage handling system had disrupted baggage sorting on October 31 and the first half of November 1. This had an impact on the flights of IndiGo. “The issue was resolved at 12.20 p.m today (November 1). We are extending all our support to IndiGo to manage the situation and working closely with the airline to ensure that the misconnected bags reach passengers. We sincerely regret the inconvenience this has caused to passengers,” said a spokesperson of the BIAL.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/delay-in-getting-luggage-irks-passengers/article37295883.ece
02 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||On Rajyotsava, Bommai launches services to ease public interface||Efforts should be made to increase the GDP of Karnataka by increasing the per capita income of the people by enabling them to contribute to the State’s economy, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai said. “Currently, Karnataka stands fourth in the country in per capita income. Just about 35% of the population is in the higher per capita bracket while the rest are unable to contribute,” he said, while launching a slew of services aimed for the public. He said that 65% of those who are unable to contribute belong to SCs/STs/OBC communities and women. He said that if the family income of these people increases, the families will be empowered economically, and the State in turn will be richer. “They can contribute to the State GDP if they are provided better services that will help them save time. They can involve themselves in gainful activities that generate income for them and wealth for the government.” The Chief Minister launched ‘Jana Sevaka’ (public services at doorstep), Janaspandana (integrated public grievance service system through 1902 helpline, mobile app and web portal), and 30 contactless services online in the Transport Department. These services, the Chief Minister pointed out, will help bring wealth to the State and provide convenience to the public. “If the services are provided at the doorstep, they can engage themselves in other gainful activities,” Mr. Bommai said. He said that if these services are successfully implemented in Bengaluru, they can be extended to rural areas. “I have already announced that public services at the doorstep in rural areas will be launched across the State on January 26.” Mr. Bommai said that a survey had found that nearly 60 lakh people in Karnataka visit Transport Department offices for various reasons, and that efforts would be made to reduce this number with the launch of 30 contactless services. Pointing at delays in registration for vehicles, the Chief Minister said that the government had given powers to dealers to register new vehicles online. “However, we are expecting problems or obstacles to the new norms. That is why permission has been given to 10 organisations selling light motor vehicles, heavy motor vehicles and two-wheelers.” Depending on the outcome of the pilot, a decision to extend the services across Karnataka will be taken, he said. Mr. Bommai said that a committee headed by the Chief Secretary will regularly review the effectiveness in implementation of these services.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/on-rajyotsava-bommai-launches-services-to-ease-public-interface/article37295887.ece
02 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Demand for firecrackers up this Deepavali: Traders||With the festival of lights around the corner, many people from the city are crossing the State border to buy crackers. Several shops on Hosur Road, on the other side of the border, are seeing brisk business. Srinivasa B.S., a resident of Sarjapura, drove down to Hosur along with his friend to buy crackers for Deepavali. “This is the first time I am coming to Hosur for crackers. Not many cracker shops have started selling in the city. We wanted to stock up, because closer to the festival, the prices are likely to be higher,” he said. Most of the vehicles parked in front of the line of cracker shops on Hosur Road bore Bengaluru registration numbers, he said. “Each shop had at least around 20 people from Bengaluru,” he added. According to Madan Kumar of Sri Chakravarthy Traders in K.R. Puram, the price of crackers had increased by around 10% this year. He claimed that following the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, not many citizens wanted to splurge on crackers like earlier. “Many people have gone back to their hometowns since organisations have allowed work from home. This may also have an impact on our business this year,” he said. Ram from Vaishnavi Crackers Shop on Bagalur Main Road was busy getting his shop ready for the cracker sale from Tuesday. “Last year, we were in the middle of the second wave of the pandemic and people were hesitant to even celebrate. The situation has improved this year and more people are out and about. We are hopeful of good business this time around, as we are getting enquiries about crackers every day,” he said. Due to decrease in production of crackers and frequent rains in the neighbouring State, where most of the cracker manufacturing happens, the demand is higher this year, said Manjunath Hariharapura of Cracker Bazaar, Garepalya, near Silk Board. Recently, the State Government issued guidelines for the celebration of Deepavali. The guidelines specify that only green crackers will have to be sold by traders and burst by citizens. These green crackers are believed to be less harmful and polluting, compared to the conventional ones. Mr. Kumar said that most cracker companies, such as Standard and others, adhere to the strict standards and protocols set by the centre. Concurring, Mr. Hariharapura said that the crackers manufactured by these major companies are certified as being green crackers. The State Government guidelines have also permitted only licenced cracker shops to stay open only from November 1 to 10. To set up the temporary shops, the traders are required to get permission from the police. This year, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike had identified open spaces where these temporary cracker shops could be set up and shared the same with the police, sources in the civic body said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/demand-for-firecrackers-up-this-deepavali-traders/article37295880.ece
02 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Inability to recover bitcoins continues to fuel allegations||The city police that probed hacker Sri Krishna’s cybercrimes and charge-sheeted him in three cases have alleged that he hacked multiple U.S.-based bitcoin exchange wallets and stole over 5,000 bitcoins. But they have failed to recover a single bitcoin. Political circles are abuzz with reports that an American agency has flagged the case with their Indian counterparts and the Prime Minister’s Office has sought details on the case and that it is likely to lead to big-ticket political changes in Karnataka. Amida political storm over an alleged “cover-up of bitcoin scam” that the Opposition Congress has alleged involves transactions worth Rs. 10,000 crore and two prominent politicians of the State, the failure to recover the stolen bitcoins seems to be at the core of several suspicions. Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Siddaramaiah, in a series of tweets on Monday, demanded that the Chief Minister place all details of the probe before the public. “Where are the 5,000 bitcoins now? Have they been recovered or have they not been found yet?” the Congress leader asked. Senior officials in the Central Crime Branch (CCB), who arrested Sri Krishna in November 2020 in connection with a dark web drugs case, only to uncover his hacking exploits, said they were not able to recover a single bitcoin from him. The CCB had, in December 2020, claimed they had recovered 31 bitcoins worth Rs. 9 crore, only to later realise that the bitcoins he transferred to a government wallet in the presence of experts were not his own, but from a hacked account. “This only shows how skilled and dodgy he is. He neither has a bank account nor a mobile phone. We have electronic evidence of his online activities to substantiate our allegations. The lack of recovery of stolen goods is not the norm in every case,” an official said. Stashed away? Agencies believe Sri Krishna, 26, now out on bail, has either spent most of the bitcoins he stole or may have stashed them in a secret wallet or in offshore accounts that they have failed to uncover. The State Government wrote to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Interpol Division of Central Bureau of Investigation. The ED, which has questioned Sri Krishna over five times, has also failed to recover any bitcoins from him. “We suspect that he may have stashed some money, converting the bitcoins to hard currency in some offshore location. We have written to several foreign countries where there is such a possibility, but to no avail so far,” a senior ED official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/inability-to-recover-bitcoins-continues-to-fuel-allegations/article37295907.ece
02 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Local bodies cannot be held to ransom: HC||Observing that a few people cannot be allowed to hold the local bodies in the State to ransom by getting into properties and dictating their terms, the High Court of Karnataka has said that properties of a local body will have be given on lease or rent only by way of public auction. “There are a number of municipalities, town panchayats and corporations. They own buildings, shops etc., located in their precincts and controlled by them. There should be uniformity in grant of lease. Such uniformity can come about only when there is transparency in procedure; transparency in procedure can come about only when the properties are put to public auction and every citizen is permitted to participate in the auction,” the court said. Justice M. Nagaprasanna passed the order while noting partial auctioning of some of the shops by Arkalgud Town Panchayat in Hassan district while unilaterally extending the lease period in favour of some of the shops. The provisions of the municipal laws, the court said, have to be so construed so as to keep the individuals or a class interest subordinate to larger public interest. “A few people cannot hold the entire town municipal council to ransom by getting into properties and dictating their terms. Therefore, it is always necessary and desirable that such rights are auctioned out by way of public auction,” the court said while observing that “any direction not to hold auction or to renew the lease will lead to monopoly”. In case of Arkalgud town municipal council, the court said public property coming under precincts of the council was bartered away on the basis of a circular without public auction. The question of partial auction defeats the very law and the judgments of the High Court on allowing use of public properties for generating revenue of the public authorities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/local-bodies-cannot-be-held-to-ransom-hc/article37295911.ece
02 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Two doctors duped in separate incidents||A dentist and an owner of a pathology lab became the victims of cyber crooks who posed as patients and duped them in separate incidents and made away with Rs. 45,000. G. Nagajyothi, a 50-year-old dentist from Nagarabhavi, in her complaint to the West Division cyber crime police recently, said that the accused called her seeking an online consultation. The accused, posing as Praveen Kumar from J.P. Nagar, said that he wanted to get a dental implant for his father and asked for the charges. Dr. Nagajyothi said she would first consult the patient and examine him physically and the accused sent a photo of the patient. As soon as the fee was revealed, the accused sent her Rs. 2 on Google Pay, asking her to accept a link so that he could send the fee in advance. As soon as the link was accepted, Rs. 20,000 was debited from her account and the accused was not reachable. Similarly, a conman, posing as an Army officer, called Manasa H.P., the owner of a path lab in Rajajinagar, and asked for the invoice. As soon as Dr. Manasa shared the details, he sent a link on the pretext of payment asking her to accept it. Seconds after she accepted the link, Rs. 25,000 was deducted from her account. Based on her complaint, the North Division cyber crime police have taken up a case and are investigating. A police officer said it is the most common form of online fraud.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/two-doctors-duped-in-separate-incidents/article37295881.ece

Though the results will not affect the State Government in terms of strength in the Assembly, the polls were fiercely fought with the Congress and the BJP mounting a pitched campaign and the JD(S) also fielding candidates in both constituencies. Being the first election faced by Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai after he took over, it is seen as a “litmus test” for him. Polling for both constituencies was held on October 30 with people coming out in good numbers to exercise their franchise. However, both constituencies saw a slight decline in polling compared to 2018. The bypoll was necessitated following the death of six-time MLA and former Minister C.M. Udasi in Hangal (BJP).

02 November 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Educational institutions seek resumption of train services||The Dakshina Kannada District Pre University College Principals Association, Mangaluru, has urged the Railway Ministry to resume forthwith services of passenger trains between North Kerala and Mangaluru to help students travel from border areas of Kerala to Mangaluru. In a recent letter to Railway Minister, the association said that earlier too representations were made seeking resumption of passenger train services from Kerala to Mangaluru. Thousands of students travel from the border areas, including Kasaragod and Manjeshwar, to Mangaluru to pursue education, right from high school to professional courses, every day. With the State Government allowing resumption of physical classes from Class 1, there has been a great demand for passenger train services, the association said. It noted that all regular travellers entering the State from Kerala undergo weekly RT-PCR tests as mandated by the government and this is being followed by students too. Secretary and Correspondent, Ganapathi Aided PU College, Mahesh L. Bondal told The Hindu that students are now being forced to travel by buses incurring heavy expenditure. There is the inconvenience of changing buses at the border as inter-State bus services are yet to resume. Mr. Bondal, who is also secretary of Anandashram Aided High School and Parijnan PU College at Someshwar, said that the Charavathur-Mangaluru Passenger is one among the few catering to travelling students from Kerala to Mangaluru before it was cancelled due to the pandemic. It was popularly known as student special. Resumption of its services will help thousands of students and their parents. Also, a large number of working class people depend upon passenger trains, he said and added that travelling by bus or private vehicles is resulting in huge expenditure for them. He pointed out that the Konkan Railway has resumed the services of Madgaon-Karwar-Madgaon DEMU Passenger. Mr. Bondal also noted that educational institutions are regularly monitoring whether students from Kerala had with them COVID-19 test negative certificates on a weekly basis. As such, there is no harm in resuming passenger train services, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/educational-institutions-seek-resumption-of-trains/article37295900.ece

Speaking at the Rajyotsava celebrations at the Mahatma Gandhi Stadium at Ajjarakad in Udupi, he said that Sarojini Mahishi Report has recommended that Kannadigas be given jobs on priority both in government and private sectors.

Mr. Kumar said that the number of awards to be given, criteria to select the achievers for the district-level award will be streamlined and a circular to this effect will be issued to every district. Speaking to media persons later, the Minister said that as there is no provision to give State-level Rajyotsava Award posthumously, it could not be given to actor Puneeth Rajkumar who passed away recently. But a befitting honour will be paid to the actor as he had supported many programmes of the government, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/law-likely-on-jobs-on-priority-basis-for-kannadigas-in-state/article37296380.ece

While children, some with smiles on their faces and others crying, entered classrooms across the State on Monday, hundreds of students like Anusree in different parts of flood-hit Kuttanad in Alappuzha have to wait longer to experience the joy of being back to school. "After several months of online learning, I was looking forward to going to school on Monday. After all, it would have been nice to be in a classroom, talking to friends and attending offline classes. But I will have to wait. My school premises remains waterlogged and the authorities postponed the reopening," says Anusree. Knee-deep water While a number of schools in Kuttanad reopened on Monday, authorities delayed the opening of 40 institutions, including 10 high schools in the region, due to waterlogging and issues caused by the recent flooding. On Monday, there was knee-deep water at the 106-year-old Government High School, Kuppapuram. The school premises had been getting waterlogged frequently since the 2018 deluge and students face hardships to reach classrooms. Recurring breaches on the outer bund of the Kanakkassery paddy polder and delay in plugging the leak have only worsened the situation. “I joined the school on June 1, 2020 and am yet to meet all the students together. We were planning to welcome students back to the school on Monday, but the prevailing conditions forced us to delay the opening,” says Ajithkumar P., the school headmaster. As the flood situation improves, schools in Kuttanad, which remain closed, plan to reopen in a phased manner. “Parents want the school to be reopened soon and teachers also expressed their readiness. We are planning to start classes for students of Class X on Wednesday after obtaining approval from the higher authorities. If floodwaters recede, the school will start functioning normally from next week,” says Mr. Ajithkumar. V.R. Shyla, Deputy Director of Education, Alappuzha, said schools that remained shut would be reopened after assessment of the flood situation and cleaning.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/flooding-causes-delay-in-kuttanad/article37296240.ece

02 November 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||‘Nokkukooli’ is extortion: HC||The Kerala High Court on Monday observed that until headload workers understand that their attempt to extort money under the euphemism of ‘nokkukooli’ would invite very serious consequences, the confidence of the State as an investor-friendly destination cannot be firmly established. Justice Devan Ramachandran observed that what was at stake was not the business interests of the petitioner in the case before the court, but the collective interests of the State. On economic well-being Unless deleterious tendencies such as nokkukooli were done away with, the industrial and business atmosphere could never get better. No Government could countenance tendencies that destroy the economic well-being of a State. The court made these observations while dealing with a case seeking police protection against the demand for nokkukooli by headload workers. Any attempt to demand nokkukooli directly or in a veiled manner should be treated as extortion and the perpetrators should be brought to book under the most stringent provisions of the law. The court said that even after the High Court declaration against demanding nokkukooli, the media reported that it was still being practised. The State Government submitted that stringent measures had been taken against those who demanded nokkukooli. Counsel for the Kerala State Headload Workers Welfare Board submitted that its members had been given awareness classes and asked not to indulge in violence or demand nokkukooli.

The attendance in government and aided schools was better than that in unaided institutions going by the initial feedback from stakeholders. However, the authorities have pointed out that it could not be assessed properly as the schools were operating in batches. New normal Both parents and children remained anxious on the first day of reopening as the ‘new normal’ included wearing masks and physical distancing inside the classroom and outside. Teachers also shared a similar concern as they have to be extra cautious to avoid the possibility of a spread or formation of clusters within the campuses. Industries Minister P. Rajeeve, who inaugurated the district-level ‘praveshanotsavam’ online , stressed the need to comply with the safety guidelines while continuing with the offline mode of learning. The first day was devoted mainly for educating children on the safety and health protocols prescribed by the Education and Health departments. Principals of various schools spoke to the students and told them not to lower their guard. Children having co-morbidities and experiencing cold and fever symptoms were told to remain at home till they recovered. The authorities said many differently abled children preferred to stay at home even as some parents conveyed their wish to send the children to schools after taking stock of the situation. Ernakulam Deputy Director of Education Honey G. Alexander said regular assessment and monitoring would be conducted to ensure the safety of students and teachers. Unaided managements cited the non-availability of school buses for the low turnout in most schools. Some schools are planning to operate buses in the coming days, if the parents agree to meet the hike in bus fee following the rise in fuel prices. The associations of managements also urged the government to relax the norm of one student per seat to bring in more students to campuses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ensuring-students-safety-to-be-challenge/article37296190.ece
02 November 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Actor objects to Cong. road blockade, injured in melee||A blockade of the Vyttila-Edappally NH bypass organised by the Ernakulam District Congress Committee (DCC) on Monday against the spiralling fuel price caused traffic snarls on the stretch and choked traffic on other roads in the city. Actor Joju George, who objected to the blockade, was injured in a stand-off with the party workers and the rear windscreen of his car was shattered in the melee. The Maradu police registered two cases against the party activists. They have been charged with under Indian Penal Code Sections 143 (unlawful assembly), 147 (rioting) and 283 (posing danger or obstruction in public way) and under Kerala Epidemic Diseases Ordinance, 2020 for gathering in violation of social-distancing norms, in a suo motu case by the police. In addition, they have been charged under IPC Sections 341 (wrongful restraint), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) 294 B (use of obscene words), 427 (a mischief that caused damage) and 506 (criminal intimidation), apart from Kerala Prevention of Damage to Private Property and Payment of Compensation Act, 2019, based on a complaint by the actor. Many stranded The traffic regulations of the police did not yield the desired results and the traffic gridlocks lasted well after 2 p.m. A large number of people were stranded on the road on a day when schools reopened in the State. On the allegation that the actor spoke rudely to women, a senior police officer said video footage of the incident was available and action would be taken based on it. With a section of activists alleging that he was drunk, he volunteered to do a blood test. The result from Tripunithura Taluk Hospital showed he was not driving under the influence of liquor. Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president K. Sudhakaran accused Mr. George of attempting to disrupt the protest and ‘misbehaving’ with women party workers. He said the actor was drunk and criticised the police for not taking action against him. Women workers would file a complaint against the actor, he said. Actor’s stance Mr. George said he was enraged by many motorists getting stranded for over an hour on the NH bypass. “Among the people inconvenienced were patients, including a child who was being taken to hospital for chemotherapy. I did not speak rudely to any woman,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/actor-objects-to-cong-road-blockade-injured-in-melee/article37296198.ece
02 November 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Court seeks report on child welfare council’s licence||The Family Court, Thiruvananthapuram, on Monday sought a report from the State Government on whether the Kerala State Council for Child Welfare (KSCCW) had valid licence to function as a specialised adoption agency. The court also sought a report whether the council had followed the mandatory legal procedures while dealing with the baby of the young mother who had complained that her child was given in adoption against her will. The council had courted controversy following the allegation of the mother that the agency had abetted the adoption process by illegally obtaining her consent. Report on process In his order on Monday, Family Court judge K. Biju Menon sought to know whether the council had given a declaration to the State Adoption Resource Agency that there were no claimants for the child after publishing its details in leading newspapers. The court also sought copies of the newspapers in which the details of the child were published. The court wanted the State to submit an affidavit whether the council had reported the case to the Missing Persons Bureau of the police or the National Tracking System for Missing and Vulnerable Children as mandated by the Kerala Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Rules, 2014. The court wanted to know whether the council had submitted a copy of the report which it should file before the police station before the Child Welfare Committee, Thiruvananthapuram, on the baby. The court also sought a copy of the police report. DNA test The judge noted that the committee could decide on the DNA test to determine the biological parentage of the baby. The court proceedings should not deter the committee from re-examining adoption procedures related to the baby as no final decision was taken in the case. The committee can also adjudicate whether the baby was abandoned or surrendered as there was no mention about it in the application filed by the KSCCW in the court. The court posted the case for November 11.  Court seeks to know whether forum had followed legal steps in the recent ‘child missing’ case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/court-seeks-report-on-child-welfare-councils-licence/article37296201.ece

Their smiles were hidden behind their masks as they turned eloquent when asked about the precautions to be taken inside the classroom. “We have to sit at a distance from each other and not share anything with others,” they said as their class teacher distributed chocolates on the first day of the school reopening. “Students will come in two batches a week as part of the bio-bubble model proposed by the Education Department. We have divided the 38 students in two divisions of Class 5 into two batches of 19 children each. Today, 13 of the 19 in the first batch came to school,” said the teacher. Festive look The school, ravaged by the raging waters in the 2018 deluge, wore a festive look as its premises were decorated with balloons and colourful festoons. Teachers, members of the staff and the parent-teacher association along with elected representatives were busy making arrangements for a smooth return to the physical mode of teaching and learning. “A section of the parents brought their children in their own vehicles in the morning while some students opted for public transport. Some children in the higher secondary section came on their bicycles,” said T.V. Jaljakumari, Principal of the higher secondary section. “Of the 27 students in the first batch in the science stream, 25 students attended while 21 of the 28 students in the first batch of the commerce stream turned up on the first day,” she said. Parents raised concerns about the safety of their children amidst the pandemic situation. However, a majority of them said they would like to send their children to school as the face-to-face mode was better than the digital sessions. “We have also told our children to maintain physical distancing on the campus,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/on-day-1-smiles-and-worries-hidden-behind-masks/article37296183.ece

Justice V.G. Arun passed the interim order on a petition by the Knanaya Catholic Naveekarana Samithi, Kumarakom, and two others challenging a stay order of the Additional District Court. The court had stayed a decree of a subordinate court restraining the Metropolitan Archbishop of the Archeparchy of Kottayam from expelling members who got married outside the diocese. The subordinate court had also declared that by marrying so, a member of the Archeparchy of Kottayam will not forfeit the membership. In three months While disposing of the petition, the court said that if any member of a church under the Kottayam Archeparchy wished to marry a Catholic from another diocese, he/she could request the issuance of a Vivahakkuri or no objection certificate. The question of whether the person had forfeited his/her membership in the archeparchy on account of the marriage would depend on the judgment in the appeal. The court asked the appellate court to make earnest efforts to dispose of the appeals within three months.

Justice Devan Ramachandran, while dealing with a case against putting up flag masts on the Mannam Sugar Mill premises in Pandalam, said the culture of putting up flag mast by influential political parties and other associations had permeated society deeply. Political and other similar flag masts were being installed across the length and breadth of the State without any respite. The court said there could not be any doubt that any such installation could be set up at public space or on road only after obtaining necessary permission from the local self-government institution or such other competent authority. The court observed that not merely were flagpoles erected, the persons who did it seemed to think that they were in possession of the land on which it was put up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-disallows-erection-of-flagpoles-sans-nod/article37296169.ece

The resumption of classes had a “robotic touch” in one of the city schools too. The students of JDT Islam High School in Kozhikode city were welcomed by robotic devices, which sprayed sanitisers on their hands and gave them sweets. The devices were prepared in the Atal Tinkering Lab of the school. The event was opened by Kozhikode District Education Officer N.P. Mohammad Abbas. The school was among the 1,270 in the district that opened after a gap of over one-and-a-half years of the pandemic break. For some students in the primary classes, this was the first experience of classes in the offline mode as they were confined to their houses all these days. Alert was the keyword at every place as thermal scanners, hand sanitisers and face masks were provided. The classes would be held till afternoon for two weeks. Students have been divided into batches, each of which would get to spend at least three days in a week. Differently abled students were exempted from coming to schools.

02 November 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Uncovered drains turn deathtraps||Endangering pedestrians’ safety, a number of deep drainages are remaining open along suburban and city roads like deathtraps where the city corporation is yet to make quick intervention. Within the past three months alone, two persons fell into such uncovered drains and lost their lives. The latest incident took place at Palazhi on Saturday where a middle-aged autorickshaw driver was found dead inside an open drain. Union leaders representing autorickshaw drivers from the area said the man reportedly fell into the open drain while he was wading through a waterlogged road. During the rainy season, many persons unfamiliar with the dangerous condition of drains had met with such freak accidents causing serious leg injuries, they said. Though many of the dangerous open drains in the urban area had been earlier closed by the corporation authorities following mass complaints, they failed to complete the emergency work in many of the unnoticed suburban areas. Such uncovered locations were later found emerging as problem spots during heavy rain. “There are many isolated stretches of drainages remaining uncovered along the city roads near Eranhipalam, Puthiyara, Medical College, Nadakkavu, Elathur and West Hill areas. The most dangerous ones are those located in between the renovated stretches which never catch the attention of pedestrians,” says an ex-serviceman from West Hill. The delay in replacing the partly collapsed slabs with stronger ones were also found creating huge safety hurdles for pedestrians along the national and State highways in the city. According to officials, the contractors were allegedly trying to postpone or delay the execution of low-cost maintenance works. “It’s natural for pedestrians to walk over covered drains along highways to skip waterlogged roads and avoid the rush of vehicles. Many a time, they fall into traps because of the poor number of street lights in such vulnerable areas,” says P.V. Vineesh, a delivery boy from Pavangad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/uncovered-drains-turn-deathtraps/article37296168.ece
02 November 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Calicut varsity yet to have backup of digital data, records||The recent breaking down of computer servers of the University of Calicut has raised questions about the security system that should have been in place for safekeeping of digital data and records. According to sources, the servers broke down on Saturday, but there were some technical problems on Friday itself. Sources said that students were not able to complete the process of submitting applications, whose last date was on Friday. At least some people, who had come to the university for their various needs, had to return empty handed. Though the authorities claim that the problems were resolved by Saturday itself, the digital document filing system is not yet completely restored. Also, it is not yet sure if the data stored at the Pareeksha Bhavan, the examination wing, has been lost or not. If the data is lost, that will make scrutiny of grade cards and mark lists difficult. “Lack of security is still a problem. The servers are kept at the Tagore Nikethan complex. If there is an unforeseen incident there, all the data will be lost as the university is yet to have a proper backup server,” an official, who wished not to be named, said. The official said that the university was yet to make use of the servers purchased for the hyperconverged system. The lack of a proper uninterrupted power supply system has been cited as one of the reasons for this. It is learnt that these servers will be kept as they are until the guarantee period is over.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/calicut-varsity-yet-to-have-backup-of-digital-data-records/article37296161.ece

Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Union Minister for Minority Affairs, announced the list of airports, ignoring the plea of the State government. According to the decision, the Cochin International Airport will cover Kerala, Lakshadweep, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu, and Andaman and Nicobar. The others are Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Lucknow, Guwahati, and Srinagar. The Ministry of Civil Aviation had banned the operation of wide-bodied aircraft after the Boeing 737-800 Air India Express flight crashed on August 7, 2020, killing 21 persons and injuring 100 passengers. Incidentally, the operation of wide-bodied aircraft was banned at the Calicut airport from May 2015 after the Court of Inquiry report on the Air India Express Boeing 737 crash in Mangaluru in May 2010. Last year, the Airport Advisory Committee of the Calicut International Airport had urged the Centre to restore the Haj embarkation point at the airport so that it would hugely benefit pilgrims from north Kerala. It was in July 2019 that the operation of Haj flights was resumed by Saudia (Saudi Arabian Airlines) after a gap of four years. For Haj 2022, the embarkation points have been reduced from 21 to 10. Also, the entire process which began on Monday (November 1) will be online. The last date of applying for Haj 2022 is January 31, 2022. The people can apply for Haj online and also through “Haj Mobile App” equipped with modern facilities, the Ministry said. The applicants should have taken two doses of approved COVID-19 vaccines at least one month before the departure. Besides, the Haj application is provisional, subject to final guidelines of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The advance amount is Rs. 81,000 for provisionally selected pilgrims. Quoting Mr. Naqvi, a Ministry of Minority Affairs press release said that this time, Indian Haj pilgrims would promote "Vocal for Local'', going to Haj with indigenous products. Earlier, Haj pilgrims used to buy bed sheets, pillows, towels, umbrellas, and other items in Saudi Arabia in foreign currency. This time, it said most of these indigenous goods would be bought in India in Indian currency. While these goods would be available in India at about 50% lower prices in comparison with Saudi Arabia, it would also encourage “Swadeshi” and "Vocal for Local". All these items would be given to Haj pilgrims at their respective embarkation points in India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/calicut-airport-not-a-haj-embarkation-point/article37296166.ece

President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi were among those who greeted the State on the occasion. Extending Kerala Piravi greetings to the people of the State, Mr. Modi in his message hailed Kerala for its picturesque surroundings and the industrious nature of its people. He also wished the people all success in their endeavours. In his message a day ago, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had appealed to the citizens to uphold democratic values and religious brotherhood.

Book festival Speaker M.B. Rajesh greeted the people of Kerala which, he said, has remained rooted to the values of democracy, secularism and humanity. He also inaugurated a book festival organised at the Kerala Assembly to mark the Kerala Piravi day and the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav celebrations. The Assembly felicitated its women legislators of the past and present at a ceremony organised as part of the SAMAM campaign for gender equality by the Culture Department.

02 November 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Majoritarianism is a political pandemic: Mukul Kesavan||Terming majoritarianism a ‘political pandemic’, writer-historian Mukul Kesavan has said such tendencies have become an existential threat to pluralist societies and polities across the world. He was delivering the Vakkom Moulavi Memorial Lecture 2021 organised by Vakkom Moulavi Memorial and Research Centre (VMMRC) on the theme ‘A comparative understanding of modern majoritarianism’ at Vakkom on Monday. Mr. Kesavan, an associate professor of History and Culture at Jamia Millia Islamia in New Delhi, pointed out majoritarianism that referred to a notion that a nation’s political destiny should be determined by ethnic or religious majority had affected many countries including Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, in the first decade of their independence. While India had resisted such tendencies till the early 1980s, the massacre in Assam in 1983 was a landmark, followed by the anti-Sikh pogrom in Delhi in 1984 and the subsequent riots in Mumbai, Gujarat and other parts. Explicit Opining the modern-day majoritarianism was explicit and “sets out to make an example of the minority”, Mr. Kesavan explained how the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingyas was publicly defended both by Myanmar’s junta and its erstwhile ruling party, the National League for Democracy. He also drew parallels between France and China in their alleged suspicion of Muslim ‘extraterritoriality’. Political parties and voters across the political spectrum have targeted French Muslims as a dangerously unassimilated minority. Calling India’s tryst with majoritarianism a paradigmatic case, Mr. Kesavan felt the country would never be able to attempt a large-scale ethnic cleansing as done by China and Myanmar, even if its rulers wanted to. This was because the country was home to two hundred million Muslims with the population being both dispersed and massive. “India’s experience and practice of managing difference–economic, cultural, religious and linguistic–in a pluralist way represented a living political experiment,” Mr. Kesavan concluded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/majoritarianism-is-a-political-pandemic-mukul-kesavan/article37296398.ece

Recommeded He recommended setting up proper inundation markings as well as timely alerts using modern technology. “There could be disruptions in power supply. Hence, SMS and call alerts must be implemented for evacuating people in a timely manner. In order to invent new methods for reducing the risk of such disasters, there must be hackathon-like events conducted for engineers and other professionals,” he said.

02 November 2021||ANANTAPUR/KURNOOL,ANDHRA PRADESH||Demand for crackers likely to go up this year||With a relaxed atmosphere for some time in the State given the decline in the daily COVID-19 tally, retailers in Rayalaseema are vying with each other to buy crackers from wholesalers in anticipation of sales going up this year. But, shortage of supply has come as a big disappointment for them. COVID-induced restrictions had stalled production of firecrackers at several units leaving little-to-no stocks with wholesalers. Some of them, who had leftover stocks from last year, are making most of the citation, said Mallikarjun, who was setting up a shop in Kurnool. The retailers who had booked in advance will have some edge over the last-minute retailers. The number of stalls also might decrease on the ground, said Mallikarjun. The average price being quoted now was up by 30% compared to last year’s prices. While Anantapur district alone has 454 license applications from retailers, authorities in Kurnool district have already issued 150 permissions and are expecting some more demand. The preparations are in full swing at the STBC College Kurnool for the sale of crackers from Monday and stalls have been erected behind KIMS Saveera Hospital for sale in Anantapur. ‘Demonstration given’ Anantapur Deputy Superintendent of Police G. Veeraraghava Reddy said 100 licenses had been issued in the city alone out of 454 received from all over the district. Divisional Fire Officer Aswath said that a demonstration was given to all the prospective and current license holders at the District Fire Office on how to construct the stalls and what to do in case of mishaps. Kurnool District Fire Officer V. Sreenivas Reddy said that stalls were being built in a square, but some of them have been removed and they would be allowed in L Shape only so that even in case of an accident there was scope for people to run into the open. “None of them would be allowed to display crackers by opening boxes and all unsold ones have to be returned to the wholesalers,” he added. None would be allowed to stock them after November 4 at any other place.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/demand-for-crackers-likely-to-go-up-this-year/article37296304.ece

Participating in the 66th Rajyotsava function at Sree Kanteerava Stadium here, the Chief Minister said the Government would take a decision to ensure maximum jobs for Kannadigas in both public and private sectors. “It’s not important how much money entrepreneurs invest in Karnataka, but how many jobs are they providing to Kannadigas,” he said. The existing incentive-driven policy for industries would be reviewed to ensure more jobs for local people in small and medium sectors, Mr. Bommai said. The Chief Minister said Kannada would always get priority in the State administration, policies and programmes. “Our language has a rich history of thousands of years. We are blessed with a rich diversity and natural resources, and also the resources and skill to safeguard them,” he said. Despite many cultural and historical invasions, Kannada retained its rich cultural diversity. “It is our duty to promote Kannada not only in Karnataka but also in other parts of the country and the globe. Kannada vachanas and folk songs should reach the length and breadth of the country,” Mr. Bommai said. PM extends greetings Greeting the people of Karnataka, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, “Best wishes on the special occasion of Karnataka Rajyotsava.

02 November 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Puneeth’s death triggers rush at hospitals in Bengaluru||Following the sudden death of 46-year-old Kannada actor Puneeth Rajkumar due to cardiac arrest, there seems to be panic among people, especially youngsters, who are now rushing to hospitals for a cardiac evaluation. The outpatient department (OPD) at the State-run Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research was flooded with patients on Monday, although it was a government holiday. Institute Director C.N. Manjunath told The Hindu that while doctors usually see around 1,200 patients in the OPD on Mondays, the flow was nearly 30% higher than normal this Monday. “Till evening, doctors attended to over 1,600 patients, nearly 20% of whom had just come out of panic after watching on television about Puneeth’s death. Some 10%, who are follow-up patients, turned up ahead of their scheduled visits,” the doctor said. “The patient flow was unusually high on Sunday too. OPDs do not function on Sundays, and we see patients only in the emergency. While we used to see around 150 patients on Sundays, we had over 550 patients this Sunday (October 31) at our institute in Bengaluru. Even in Mysuru, where we see around 75 patients on Sundays, we had over 350 this Sunday,” Dr Manjunath said. Annual check-up The doctor said, “It is prudent to undergo regular medical checks if people have a family history or risk factors and comorbidities or have some symptoms. But, rushing to the hospital out of panic like this is unwarranted. I have always said that men above 35 years and women above 45 years should get an annual medical check done. It should be regular affair similar to birthdays and anniversaries.” Pointing out that most of those who rushed to the OPD on Monday came with anxiety, Dr. Manjunath said, “Getting tests done was a kind of reassurance to them. With a proper system in place, all the 1,600 patients got their reports by 5 p.m. Some of them were even counselled.” The sudden influx of patients has put a lot of stress on staff at the institute including doctors, nurses, technicians and other support staff. “We have a set time table wherein a particular unit handles the OPD on each day of the week. Because of the large crowd, we had to get some doctors and post-graduates from other non-OPD units,” Dr. Manjunath said. K.S. Ravindranath, professor of Cardiology at the institute, added, “We were surprised to find many follow-up patients turning up ahead of their scheduled dates.” While the routine temperature and oxygen saturation is checked at the entrance while letting in patients, the staff found it difficult to ensure physical distance was maintained. Private hospitals too Private hospitals too witnessed similar scenes. Cardiologists in Aster CMI Hospitals said they noticed a three-fold increase in the OPD flow as well as emergency. Pradeep Kumar D., Senior Consultant (Interventional Cardiology) at the hospital said patients, most of them in their 40s, came with complaints of chest pain and anxiety. Ranjan Shetty, interventional cardiologist at Manipal Hospitals on Old Airport Road, who also saw an increase in his OPD, said such health checks should not be out of panic. “We have advising patients to get it done on a regular basis,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/puneeths-death-triggers-rush-at-hospitals-in-bengaluru/article37295782.ece
02 November 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Charges framed against 18 accused in Gauri case||A city court framed charges against the 18 accused in the Gauri Lankesh murder case on October 30 [Saturday], nearly three years after the police filed a charge sheet against them. The accused, presently lodged in prisons in Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Pune, were presented before court through video conferencing. Charges were read out to them in the language of their choice: Marathi and Kannada. All accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. This clears the decks for the trial in the case to begin, four years after Ms. Lankesh was killed. The court adjourned the case to December 8, when the modalities of the trial will likely begin, sources said. “The defence has employed several delay tactics in the case till now. We hope this doesn’t repeat again and we will be able to fasttrack the trial,” said a senior SIT official. The court also confirmed charges against all the accused under the Karnataka Control of Organised Crimes Act, 2000 and the Arms Act, 1959, apart from a host of other charges under the Indian Penal Code, including murder and conspiracy. One of the accused, Mohan Naik, had charges under KCOCA, 2000 quashed against him in the Karnataka High Court earlier this April, giving the prosecution some tense days. However, the Supreme Court, hearing a petition by the complainant Kavita Lankesh, confirmed the KCOCA, 2000 charges in October. Ms. Lankesh was shot dead by two assailants outside her residence on September 5, 2017. The Special Investigation Team that probed the case filed a chargesheet in November 2018 against 18 accused, of whom one — only identified as Nihal alias Dada — is still at large. The charge sheet alleges that members associated with the Sanatan Sanstha and the Hindu Janjagruti Samiti inspired by Kshatra Dharma Sadhana , a book published by sanstha, formed an unnamed gang, conspired, and killed Ms. Lankesh as they deemed her to be “anti-Hindu”. Pune-based Amol Kale has been named as the prime accused in the case, while Parashuram Waghmore from Sindgi, Vijayapura district, has been identified as the shooter who killed Ms. Lankesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/charges-framed-against-18-accused-in-gauri-case/article37295777.ece
02 November 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Actor’s eyes give sight to four persons||The late Kannada actor Puneeth Rajkumar has gifted eyesight to four persons. Doctors at Narayana Nethralaya, who collected his corneas, said they sliced and transplanted them into four corneal blind patients. Addressing mediapersons in Bengaluru on Monday, K. Bhujang Shetty, chairman and managing director of Narayana Nethralaya, said, “We are very fortunate and grateful for ‘Power Star’ Puneeth Rajkumar’s eye donation. What was unique is that we used each eye to treat two patients by separating the superior and deeper layers of the cornea.” “The superior layer was transplanted into two patients, who had superficial corneal disease, and the deeper layer transplanted into patients with endothelial or deep corneal layer disease. Hence, we created four different transplants from two corneas to restore the vision of four people. This has not been done in Karnataka so far, to the best of our knowledge,” Dr. Shetty said. Following in the footsteps of his father Dr. Rajkumar, the family of Puneeth Rajkumar donated his eyes on October 29, soon after he was declared dead. Dr. Rajkumar had pledged the eyes of his entire family during the inaugural function of the eye bank in 1994. The corneal transplant procedures were performed on October 30. “Finding suitable recipients for the procedures was a challenge. We sought help from B.L. Sujatha Rathod, director of the State-run Minto Ophthalmic Hospital,” he said. Elaborating on the procedures, the doctor said the outer or superficial part of cornea was transplanted into two young patients with corneal dystrophy and keratoconus. Both these conditions affect predominantly the superficial layer of the cornea, while the deeper part of the eye is normal. The inner or deeper layer of the cornea was transplanted into two patients with corneal endothelial decompensation affecting the innermost layer of the cornea. “Besides this, the limbal rim (white part of the eye near the circumference of the cornea), which was not used for the transplants, has been sent to our lab to generate ‘Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells’ for potential use in patients with Limbal Stem Cell deficiency, chemical injuries, acid burns and other serious disorders,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/actors-eyes-give-sight-to-four-persons/article37295780.ece
02 November 2021||CHENNAI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Chennai school pulled up for keeping attendance registers with caste names||A primary school had been maintaining attendance registers organising the student rolls on the basis of caste before it was pulled up by Greater Chennai Corporation on Monday. The GCC has directed the school to discontinue the practice at once. Since the school had also divided its students into three batches on the basis of their attendance roster owing to COVID-19, it turned out that students were bunched together on the basis of their community alone. ‘Alphabetical order’ The GCC directed the school to drop the existing practise and asked it to prepare fresh batches based on the alphabetical order of the name of students. When this correspondent visited the school on Monday evening, the headmistress said: “This is not new and we have been following this attendance registers even before. We are not segregating students on caste basis. It so happened that most students of a caste are in one batch. It is unintentional.” She also produced attendance registers that showed caste mentioned against every student and said students are enrolled in the attendance register in the following order – SC (A), SC (O), MBC, BC-Hindu, BC-Christian, BC-Muslim and OC. “This is only for administrative purpose. Students won’t know which caste they are,” she maintained. When contacted, D. Sneha, Deputy Commissioner (Education), GCC said: “Across all schools, the attendance is meant to be in alphabet order only. This has never been the practice, and we'll ensure it's set right. Thank you for letting us know.” Asked about the batches, she said: “The batches will naturally change, the parents of the children will be informed today [Monday] evening.” Activist V. Gopalakrishnan demanded that action be taken against the teachers concerned. “If this can happen in Chennai city, we can only imagine the scenario in remote areas. They are teachers and they are supposed to teach against casteism and not remind them of their caste. Action must be taken against the teachers concerned. Be it intentional or otherwise, discrimination is discrimination and it cannot be tolerated.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/gcc-pulls-up-school-for-maintaining-attendance-registers-with-caste-names/article37295941.ece

Talking to the media, the contractor said he undertook construction of five anganwadis in Chittoor in 2018 after being pursued by the district officials. “Since 2018, I have been waiting to receive the payment of bills to the tune of Rs. 15 lakh. The officials concerned expressed their helplessness saying that they had just forwarded the bills. Now, I have to clear the loans and interests to my debtors, pending since 2018. If my grievance is not resolved, my family members and I have no option but to commit suicide,” he deplored.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/contractor-locks-anganwadi-demanding-clearance-of-bills/article37296298.ece

Addressing the 66th Andhra Pradesh State Formation Day celebrations at the Police Parade Grounds, Mr. Vivek Yadav said that the sacrifice made by Sreeramulu roused the people forcing the Centre to create a separate Andhra Province on October 1, 1953. The towns of Guntur and Kurnool shared the honour of being the High Court and the Capital respectively. Andhra Kesari Tanguturi Prakasam became the first Chief Minister of the State. Three years later, on the recommendations of the State Reorganisation Commission’s report , the States of the Indian Union were reorganised and Andhra Pradesh was created on November 1, 1956 after the disintegration of the State of Hyderabad. The Guntur district administration is taking several measures for the all-round development of the district, Mr. Vivek Yadav said.

02 November 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||TS urges KRMB to keep A.P. portion of RDS in its purview||Telangana government has requested the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) to keep the Rajolibanda Diversion Scheme (RDS) anicut portion falling in Andhra Pradesh territory in the board purview and complete the modernisation of the anicut at the earliest. In a letter addressed to Chairman of the river board M.P. Singh, Engineer-in-Chief of Telangana C. Muralidhar pointed out that the RDS head works and related components were not proposed to be brought under the board purview, as per an interim report of a sub-committee of the board on the operationalisation of the gazette notification on the grounds that their location was outside AP and Telangana. Mr. Muralidhar brought to the KRMB Chairman’s notice that RDS project was taken up jointly by the erstwhile Hyderabad and Madras States in June 1944 to utilise Tungabhadra water on par with supplementation to K.C. Canal. Half of the 819 metre long anicut falls geographically in AP territory (Kurnool district) and the other half in Karnataka (Raichur district). Explaining that the project has 5,879 acres ayacut in Karnataka with 1.2 tmc ft water allocation and 87,500 acres in Telangana (after bifurcation of combined Andhra Pradesh) with an allocation of 15.9 tmc ft as per KWDT-I award. Of the 143 km long main canal, 42.6 km was in Karnataka with full supply discharge at RDS at 850 cusecs with 770 cusecs to be available at Karnataka-Telangana border. However, only around 400 cusecs was being realised at the State border. The ENC pointed out that the required discharge was not being realised on account non-maintaining of the required driving head at the anicut due to lower anicut height, allowing uncontrolled flow through 10 construction sluices with 3 ft diameter each, un-gated vents of the river sluices, which were helping free flow of water without allowing build-up of water level at the anicut and lack of sufficient pondage (water storage space). As a result, Telangana area was hardly realising 5 tmc ft water against the allocation of 15.9 tmc ft for the last 25 years. Mr. Muralidhar also brought to the board’s notice that modernisation of the anicut was being obstructed by AP government in the name of law and order problem. He termed the AP’s communication to Karnataka not to proceed with the work as unwarranted. Meanwhile, Superintending Engineer Sridhar Rao Deshpande, who is the Officer on Special Duty to Chief Minister on irrigation, has been included in a sub-committee on the operationalisation of gazette notification by the river board in place of Chief Engineer (inter-State water resources) V. Mohan Kumar.  Modernisation of anicut being obstructed by AP government in the name of law and order problem. C.

Officials said a case under Indian Penal Code Sections 153(a) and 153(b) had been registered against the bishop at the Kuravilangadu police station in connection with his controversial speech on September 8. “The case follows a direction in this regard by the Pala magistrate court,” said Shilpa Dyavaiah, District Police Chief (DPC), Kottayam. The court directive followed a petition filed by Abdul Asees Moulavi, district president of the All India Imams Council. According to the complainant, the police had refused to lodge a case against the bishop though formal complaints had been lodged with the Kuravilangadu station and the DPC. In his speech to the faithful, the bishop had accused a section of the Muslim community of targeting Christians through ‘love jihad’ and ‘narcotic jihad.’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/case-filed-against-bishop-for-speech/article37295783.ece
02 November 2021||Madurai,ANDHRA PRADESH||Vanniyar quota law unconstitutional: HC||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Monday declared as unconstitutional the law providing 10.5% internal reservation to the Vanniakula Kshatriya community within the 20% reservation for the Most Backward Classes (MBCs) in education and public employment. The court held that it was ultra vires the Constitution. A Division Bench of Justices M. Duraiswamy and K. Murali Shankar gave its judgment on a batch of petitions that challenged the validity of the Act, which was passed hours before the model code of conduct came into force in February for the Assembly election. No supporting material It said the State had not collected any material to prove that the Vanniyar caste — that is, the Vanniakula Kshatriya, comprising Vanniyar, Vanniya, Vannia Gounder, Gounder or Kander, Padayachi, Palli and Agnikula Kshatriya — was unable to compete with the other extremely marginalised communities. When the entire Most Backward Classes were enjoying 20% reservation, this caste alone was given 10.5%. This would affect the prospects of the others, it said. The government had not considered the caste-wise population, and there was no data available with the government to invoke the provision in the Constitution to provide internal reservation. There was nothing on record to establish that the government had held deliberations with all stakeholders, especially the communities that would be affected by the Act, the court said. The court observed that by virtue of the 102nd constitutional amendment, the powers of the Assembly to include and exclude the Backward Classes was bestowed on Parliament. But the 105th constitutional amendment restored the power of the States to identify and notify the Backward Classes. The 102nd amendment came into existence on August 11, 2018, and the 105th amendment was enacted on August 19, 2021. The court held that on the date of its enactment, February 26, 2021, the State legislature had no power to pass such legislation. The Tamil Nadu Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Reservation of Seats in Educational Institutions and of Appointments or Posts in the Services under the State) Act, 1993, was brought in to protect the 69% quota. Unacceptable, says Ramadoss Meanwhile, PMK founder S. Ramadoss on Monday urged the Tamil Nadu Government to appeal in the Supreme Court against the Madras High Court’s verdict declaring the 10.5% internal reservation for the Vanniyars unconstitutional. In a statement, he termed the verdict “unacceptable” because such questions were not raised by the Madras High Court or the Supreme Court against the internal reservation provided to the Muslims or the Arundhathiyars in Tamil Nadu. He said Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, “who has understood the need for such a quota despite the fact that the law was passed by the previous [AIADMK] government”, has the “duty and responsibility” to reinstate it through legal and political steps.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/madras-hc-terms-vanniyar-quota-law-unconstitutional/article37295904.ece

02 November 2021||New Delhi,ANDHRA PRADESH||De-recognise YSRCP, TDP MPs urge EC||A delegation of Telugu Desam Party MPs has submitted a memorandum to the Election Commission urging it to de-recognise the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) alleging that the party had violated the Representation of the People Act by encouraging “state-sponsored terror.” Meanwhile, the YSRCP will be meeting President Ram Nath Kovind on Tuesday to complain to him about the “false propaganda” by the opposition TDP which, the ruling party claims, is hurting the image of Andhra Pradesh. The latest allegation comes in the backdrop of war of words between the two opponents. Last week, YSRCP leader Vijaya Sai Reddy had called the TDP a ‘terrorist organisation’. TDP MP Kesineni Srinivas (Nani), Rajya Sabha member Kanakamedala Ravindrakumar and former MP Nimmala Kistappa met the Election Commission and submitted a 16-page memorandum. The TDP alleged that the YSRCP Government has been carrying out all-round assault on constitutional institutions in Andhra Pradesh, including the media and opposition leaders. “The YSR Congress, founded on the ill-gotten gains by these leaders, has been a front for money laundering and illicit activities even now,” the TDP memorandum said. And this money, the TDP claimed, was used to establish the media house Sakshi and to capture political power in the State. Model Code of Conduct The opposition party has pointed out seven specific violations of the general conduct guidelines of the Model Code of Conduct. The TDP claimed that the YSRCP has been “aggravating the fault lines of society”, and it is encouraging use of unparliamentary words against candidates and the State Election Commissioner during and after elections. The party also claimed that the YSRCP is “encouraging attacks on temples and turning a blind eye on the perpetrators.” The TDP also accused the ruling party of widespread election fraud in the form of printing duplicate electoral photo identification cards. Citizens and dissenting organisations have been targeted by the police at the behest of the ruling party and charges of sedition are freely slapped, the TDP said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/de-recognise-ysr-congress-telugu-desam-mps-urge-ec/article37295792.ece

Tech graduate, his friend arrested in ‘honey trap’ case||The Mylavaram police arrested two persons on charge of luring a person with the voice of a woman on a social media group, and robbing him after slitting his throat at Pulluru village in Krishna district. The accused have been identified as V. Dayakar alias Kittu, a B.Tech graduate, and B. Praneeth, both natives of Vijayawada. They allegedly lured Y. David to an isolated place on October 25. They allegedly attacked him with a blade, took away his gold chains, rings and car, before pushing him into Polavaram canal at Kavuluru village near Kondapalli. Krishna Superintendent of Police Siddharth Kaushal formed three teams with Mylavaram, Reddygudem and G. Konduru police personnel to trace the accused. Nuzvid Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) B. Srinivasulu on Monday said that Dayakar, the owner of a private firm, had allegedly cheated many unemployed people on the pretext of providing jobs. Cases have been registered against Dayakar at Penamaluru, Suryaraopeta, Satyanarayanapuram, Vuyyur, Krishnalanka police stations and in Visakhapatnam. Dayakar allegedly opened an account in the name of ‘Durga’ on a social media platform and sent friend request to the victim who accepted it. Dayakar introduced himself as Sindhu, a software engineer from Mumbai and had been in touch with David for the last two years, the police said. On October 25, David told Dayakar that he was going to attend a party in Guntur. Dayakar asked David to wait at a petrol pump at Mylavaram and that he would pick up the latter from there. When David came to the petrol pump in his car, Dayakar and Praneeth told him that they were friends of Sindhu, the Nuzvid DSP said. The accused allegedly took David to Merusumilli village, slit his throat with a blade, took away gold ornaments and pushed him into Polavaram canal thinking that he was dead. They escaped in the victim’s car. However, David who fell into the bushes survived and the villagers took him to a hospital. Later, he lodged a police complaint. The police recovered the car, gold ornaments, a blade and gloves purportedly used during the offence, the DSP added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/b-tech-graduate-his-friend-arrested-in-honey-trap-case/article37296425.ece

Narayana has said the actor-politician, along with Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu, who had led the ‘Visakha Ukku Andhrulu Hakku’ stir in the past, should impress upon the Centre to drop the privatisation of the plant. “The Jana Sena Party is agitating at the grassroots level even as it continues its ties with the BJP and this has exposed its duplicity,” said Mr. Narayana, adding that the Left, democratic, secular forces would intensify struggles against the ‘anti-people’ policies of the Narendra Modi government to oust the BJP from power at the Centre. “Eleven national parties and the Left parties have come together to take on the BJP which has made the lives of the common man miserable by imposing heavy taxes on fuel, which has triggered a rise in prices of essential commodities,” said Mr. Narayana after meeting the family members of CPI (Maoist) central committee leader Akkiraju Haragopal alias Ramakrishna alias RK at Alakurapadu in Prakasam district. “The death of RK is a big loss to the Left movement,” he said.

Jagan Mohan Reddy and Leader of Opposition N. Chandrababu Naidu for not questioning the BJP-led NDA government over the privatisation of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant. Addressing a press conference along with the party’s district unit president Boddepalli Satyavati, Mr. Chinta Mohan said that both leaders failed to utter a single word against the Centre over the highly sensitive issue. “The Congress will surely come back to power in 2024. The new government will scrap the privatisation proposal and retain the steel plant in the public sector,” said Mr.Chinta Mohan. “Only two dominant castes have ruled the State for the last 70 years without giving a chance to any other communities including the BCs, SCs and STs. Their combined population is nearly 80% but their role was minimal in the administration of the State. The YSRCP government stopped financial assistance to these sections by not releasing funds for SC, ST and BC corporations. People of downtrodden sections would not be able to get financial support to start self-employment schemes,” Mr. Chinta Mohan alleged. He expressed concern over the delay in payment of fee reimbursement and scholarships to eligible students in the State.  Populist schemes He said that the government was focussing on populist schemes instead of helping them to earn a decent livelihood, which would be made possible through strong economic activity and industrialisation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-ysr-congress-silent-over-steel-plant-issue-says-chinta/article37296346.ece

02 November 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Pinarayi govt. meekly gave in to T.N. demand’||The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) Opposition walked out of the Assembly on Monday, accusing the Kerala Government of jeopardising the State’s interest in the Mullaperiyar dispute with Tamil Nadu. Seeking leave of the House to move an adjournment motion to debate the issue, Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala said the 126-year-old dam had outlived its lifespan by at least 76 years. Experts doubted the structural integrity of the barrier built to irrigate Tamil Nadu. An estimated 30 lakh people in five districts downstream of the Mullaperiyar dam lived in fear. However, the Government was dismissive of the danger at hand. It had meekly agreed to Tamil Nadu’s insistence to maintain the Mullaperiyar water level at a dangerously high 139.5 feet during the recent flood, Mr. Chennithala said. He said the 1886 accord was loaded heavily in favour of Tamil Nadu. The then ruler of Travancore had said he had signed it reluctantly and “with his blood.” Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s “thoughtless” statement in the Assembly that apprehensions about Mullaperiyar’s safety were misplaced had bolstered Tamil Nadu’s argument in the Supreme Court that Kerala was exaggerating matters. Tamil Nadu wanted to maintain the water level at a dangerously high 142 feet, and Kerala hardly objected. However, the Supreme Court saw merit in the argument of an Idukki resident, Jose Joseph, that a lower water level would ensure better dam safety during the monsoon. Kerala and Tamil Nadu had their respective political compulsions. Hence, an all-party delegation from both States should meet to discuss a roadmap to solve the Mullaperiyar question, he said. Govt. stand Water Resources Minister Roshy Augustine said Mullaperiyar was a limited capacity dam (12.75 tmc) with an expansive catchment area (625 sq km). Hence water levels rose fast and dangerously during heavy rain. Kerala’s only option was to construct a new dam. However, it required Tamil Nadu’s concurrence, he said. Kerala had convinced Tamil Nadu to bring down the water level from 142 ft to 139 ft. Both Governments were working in tandem to ensure dam safety. The Supreme Court would hear Kerala’s side again on November 11, the Minister said. Mr. Vijayan said the scaremongering that the Mullaperiyar dam was at the cusp of bursting would animate the extreme xenophobic fringe in both States and impede the efforts of the two States to settle the issue amicably.

02 November 2021||Visakhapatnam,ANDHRA PRADESH||VSP sale a national issue: student unions||The 100% strategic sale of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) is not a local issue pertaining to this city. It is a national issue that highlights the BJP-led Centre’s adverse policy towards PSUs and its favouring the private sector, said SFI the national general secretary Mayukh Biswas. He was addressing the public after a rally led by over 4,000 students from various colleges such as Mrs. AVN College, Andhra Medical College, Andhra University and various other private colleges on Monday. The rally was taken out from Mrs. AVN College to the Old Post Office. It was organised under the aegis of the Visakha Ukku Parirakshana Porata Committee, to honour the 11 people who were killed in police firing on November 1, 1967, during the protest for the setting up of the steel plant. “The steel plant had come up after sacrifices and it is emotionally rooted to the people of Andhra. This cannot be privatised just like that. We will make this a national issue and bring the students from across the country to protest against the decision,” said AISF national general secretary Vicky Maheswari. “It is not just a fight against the privatisation of one PSU, but against unemployment and the loss of jobs, post privatisation,” said Mr. Mayukh. According to him, the privatisation of VSP, will not only impact the lives of the employees but the city, as many families are indirectly dependent on the well-being of the steel plant. Earlier, Kolla Rajmohan, who had then actively participated in the agitation, as the president of the Andhra Medical College Student Union, said it was a student-led movement . Even then employment was the focal point, as young students aspired to get a job once the steel plant was established, said Dr. Rajmohan. All the three chairmen of the Porata Committee— Ch. Narasinga Rao, Mantri Rajasekhar and Ch. Adinarayana —spoke about the sacrifices made by the people . Not only in Visakhapatnam, about 20 others had lost their lives in police firing various other places such as Guntur, Vijayawada, Warangal and Rajahmundry, pointed out Mr. Adinarayana. Mr. Narasinga Rao said the present struggle was apolitical and all political parties could join in.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vsp-sale-a-national-issue-student-unions/article37295903.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy to take an all-party delegation to New Delhi to bring pressure on the Centre to drop the privatisation of the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP), a day after Jana Sena Party president Pawan Kalyan gave a call for it.

He alleged that the administration in the State had gone for a toss during the YSRCP rule. “Ganja is being seized at various places across the country and its origin is being traced to the State.

Over 500 people, including public representatives, visited the Vizianagaram Collectorate and urged the officials to take steps to ensure that their habitations are brought under the permanent control of A.P. Their move has reportedly left officials of the neighbouring State irked, who are learnt to have been making efforts to convince the villagers to be part of Odisha . To counter this, the Vizianagaram administration has intensified its efforts to woo nearly 5,000 people living in Kotia villages which according to the local officials fall under Saluru Assembly constituency. Ganjaibhadra vice-sarpanch Gemmili Beesu said the locals were being ‘harassed’ by Odisha officials over their decision to be a part of A.P. Vizianagaram officials assured that a police outpost would be set up to protect the people. In fact, the dispute over the Kotia villages cropped up in the 1920s, with the British government then trying to carve out a solution. According to officials, the then Madras Presidency had given orders saying that Kotia villages would come under the jurisdiction of the Saluru Zamindars. The then Odisha rulers, and later the Odisha government, had refused to accept the orders, it is alleged. The neighbouring State continues to claim its jurisdiction till today over those villages as they are reportedly rich in mineral wealth, it is alleged. Lok Satta Party leader Bhisetti Babji asked the government to strive hard to secure legitimate rights over the 16 villages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tension-fills-the-air-in-kotia-villages/article37296316.ece

02 November 2021||November 02 2021 00:00 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||Southern States to jointly combat drug trafficking||But the time had come to put in a concerted effort to eradicate it. For this there was a need for coordination between the States and various other departments, and A.P. had taken the lead. “To begin with we have already started a crackdown by destroying the crops and the last time we did it was in 2017,” he said. The DGP also said that technology would play a major role in combating the menace. “We will use drones, tools embedded with artificial intelligence and there will be a lot of data collation, data sharing and data analytics,” he said. According to Mr. Sawang, so far about 5,000 accused had been arrested at various places in the State for ganja smuggling and about 50% of the arrested were from other States. Speaking about the challenges, he said that most of the ganja is cultivated in the AOB region which had presence of the banned CPI (Maoist). “The Maoists have been patronising the cultivation, as they have a cut in the smuggling and it is a source of income for them. We have to brave the threat to beat them on their turf,” he said. He also pointed out that the ‘New Andhra’ model of tackling the left wing extremism would pay dividends in the coming days. “There is a sea change among the tribals in the Agency areas and they have started to distance from the Maoists. The government schemes are reaching them and ROFR has been a game changer. The recruitment in the Maoist fold has almost dried and the LWE are importing cadres from Chhattisgarh to keep the movement alive. And this is going to be our main driving point,” he said. Mr. Sawang also poin0\ted out that the district administration had been roped in and efforts were on with other departments such as Forests to provide an alternative model of cropping for better sustenance of tribals. The ganja trade had grown in dimension over the years and now there were cultivators, financiers, seed and technology providers and transport providers and everything worked through a chain. Efforts were on to identify them, including the routes and different modus operandi, to break the network and reach the kingpins, he said. ‘No heroin link’ Answering a question on the recent unearthing of 3000 kg of heroin at Mundra port, he said that A.P. had no involvement and this was clarified by the investigating agencies. The heroin had come to Mundra from Afghanistan via Iran, he said. “If someone is trying to link A.P., it is with a malafide intention to tarnish the image of the State,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/inter-state-meet-on-drug-trafficking-held/article37296307.ece

Presenting these awards on the State Formation Day adds more glitter and it will become a regular feature as part of the celebrations hereafter,” the Governor said.

Several leaders of the TDP and Congress took part in the programme on the first day. The padayatra is being taken out as part of the agitation demanding that the capital should be located at Amaravati. The genesis In 2014, the then Chief Minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu announced that the Capital region would come up between Guntur and Vijayawada. Later, a master plan for developing Amaravati City (covering 217 sq.km) was prepared. The government claimed that 33,000 farmers had given their lands through an innovative Land Pooling Scheme (LPS) undertaken for the first time in India at that scale. The land pooling was enabled through a legislation, APCRDA Act 2014, passed by the State legislature. Construction activity began in 2017 and the trunk infrastructure was also developed. Soon after the YSRCP stormed into power, the construction activity came to a halt. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy announced in the Assembly in December 2019 that the State would have three capitals – Executive Capital at Visakhapatnam, Legislative Capital at Amaravati and Judicial Capital at Kurnool – to ensure equitable development of all three regions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/amaravati-farmers-begin-padayatra-to-tirumala/article37296321.ece

02 November 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Ganja smugglers in AP ‘blacklist’ Hyd clients||The source of supply of marijuana to Telangana State, especially Hyderabad, has been snapped with ‘growers consortium’ passing a resolution not to sell to buyers here. A series of successful attempts by Telangana police intercepting and confiscating the banned consignment in the recent past has forced the cultivators and smugglers in Visakhapatnam and other parts of the Andhra-Odisha Border (AOB) to review and stop the supply of ganja. This gag rule is suspected to have been passed as suppliers in Andhra Pradesh assume the orders emerging from Telangana State were part of a decoy operation intending to incriminate the supply sources and seize the material, is alleged. It is observed that 90% of the stock consignments to Telangana were confiscated, which is alarming statics for the suppliers. Speaking to The Hindu , a senior police officer said that the existing supply source catering to consumer needs is of last year’s crop, which was harvested in January and February of this year. It is suspected this year too ganja is cultivated to an extent of over 10,000 acres, and the output is expected to hit the market only in January and February of 2022. As the curbs have been tightened, the fresh harvest is unlikely to enter Hyderabad, asserted the police officer. “The scope for smuggling ganja into the city will almost be eliminated if the same vigil continues for at least six more months,” he said. “They are scared to sell ganja even to their regular customers, suspecting it could be decoy operations or we might catch the consignment and follow the trail,” the officer said, citing the example of the recent exchange of fire between the smugglers and Nalgonda police in Andhra Pradesh. Unusual patterns were observed in ganja sale in the city as the price of 100 grams has skyrocketed to anywhere between Rs. 800 and Rs. 1,000, as against the normal of Rs. 200 to Rs. 300. “Currently the whole market is running on previous year’s stock. It is not exhausted yet,” he said. It’s common knowledge that the main conduit of the ganja trade is the driver of a vehicle. It is with drivers’ connivance that the prohibited ‘mall’ is entering the markers seamlessly. “Majority of the stock supplied in Hyderabad is pilfered while it is being smuggled to Maharashtra, and some States in north India,” the officer maintained, adding that most of it passes through ORR and does not enter the city. Further, the officer said that local police along with Task Force officials are working on every possibility to snap the supply chain to Hyderabad city. Regular vehicle checking is also being conducted in the city and in the outskirts as well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ganja-smugglers-in-ap-blacklist-hyd-clients/article37296129.ece

Farmers’ meeting were held in as many as 41 Rythu Vedikas across Wanaparthy Assembly constituency on Monday and Mr. Niranjan Reddy has addressed the gatherings at Gopalpet and Polikepadu. “Farmers’ conditions today should be compared to their situation prior to 2014. Chief Minister has been working for the benefit of farming community and top priority is being accorded to them by offering them round-the-clock power and support like Rythu Bima and Rythu Bandhu. Such schemes are not there anywhere else in the country. Farmers should come out from the conventional farming and think about crops that would offer them better revenue. Rythu Vedikas should be used for discussion among farmers about the new farming systems they have to follow and horticulture crops,” said Mr. Niranjan Reddy adding that farmers should also focus on oil seeds and fruit crops.

02 November 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||BJP calls for ‘million march’ of unemployed youth on Nov. 12||The Bharatiya Janata Party has on Monday given a ‘Million March’ call of the unemployed, youth and students to Hyderabad from all corners of the State to force the TRS government to issue notification for filling vacant jobs on Nov.12. Top party leaders led by State chief Bandi Sanjay Kumar took the decision to hold the programme to mock the successful ‘million march’ organised during the peak of Telangana agitation by many organisations, said general secretary G. Premender Reddy, MLA T. Raja Singh, Pradeep Kumar, Manohar Reddy and others at the press conference. Giving details of the decisions taken by the leadership, they said the programme will be “peaceful and democratic” to “open the eyes of the government and also the people about the disenchantment among the youth on the unemployment scenario with no sign of any decision to fill up the existing vacancies.” “There are more than 2 lakh vacancies but this government had filled just 30,000 posts. Why it does not want to issue notification for the rest is a mystery. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao is under the impression that no one can or should question him, but we will speak on behalf of the youth. We are going to mobilise youth from every village to highlight the failed election-eve promises,” they said. The party is confident of getting the necessary police permissions for such a mammoth programme. Mr. Raja Singh criticised the government for trying every “trick” to win Huzurabad bypoll by offering large sums of money to buy voters, launching ‘Dalit Bandhu’, using police force to ‘browbeat’ the opposition and later even trying to “remove” the VVPATs, post the polling.

Some might scramble to find replacement to the substance they are addicted to. The shortage of ganja in and around Hyderabad gave rise to the anticipation that regular users of the contraband might opt for habit-forming drugs sold at medical shops. Pharmacists, wholesalers of the medicines in Telangana were instructed to keep the drugs in a cupboard which is locked, or in a place reserved solely for them. Further, its sale will be closely monitored. Officials in the Telangana Drugs Control Administration said that the State police have held series of meetings with them. The DCA officials have issued a circular to the medical retailers, wholesalers, on October 25 in which it was stated that the habit-forming drugs come under the Scheduled drugs category, which have to be sold based on prescription. The circular states that sale and purchase of habit-forming drugs come under Schedule-H, H1, X and Narcotics Drugs Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) are as per the Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940. The retailers were directed to maintain records of sale of habit-forming drugs against prescription issued by ‘Registered Medical Practitioners’. Purchase and sale invoices of habit-forming drugs have to be maintained too. Drug Inspectors said that sale of the scheduled drugs is being monitored closely from the past many years. “A few of the habit-forming drugs sold at medical shops have sedative, hypnotic effect. The scope of their sale indiscriminately is less in the State,” said a drug inspector. Chemists and druggists said that they too have been stringent about sale of habit-forming drugs.“We sell the scheduled drugs only based on prescription from Registered Medical Practitioner. Anyone can verify this. In fact, some people lodged complaints against us stating that we sold less number of the scheduled medicines against the quantity mentioned in the prescriptions,” said a chemist.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/focus-will-be-on-habit-forming-drugs/article37296122.ece

02 November 2021||NALGONDA,TELANGANA||KCR neglected all sectors, says Sharmila||YSR Telangana Party founder-president Y.S. Sharmila continued to criticise the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi and alleged that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao is consistently neglecting pressing issues. Starting her Praja Prashtana Yatra from Devarakonda’s Chintapally mandal in the district on the 13th day, she covered its various villages, interacted with people, and completed her 11-km padayatra with a message: Congress leaders are bought by TRS. A vote to Congress is indirectly a vote to TRS. Reject them both. According to Ms. Sharmila, late Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy extended Pavala Vaddi loans to poor women in rural areas. He also extended free education and distributed land to poor people. However, the present TRS government is ignoring all issues, she said. “ Pavala Vaddi has assumed Rs. 1.25 interest rate, fee reimbursements are pending, employment notifications are not being released, people hailing from dalit communities are looked down upon and sarpanches are bring cheated,” she alleged. Ms. Sharmila also wondered if gram panchayats are receiving the minimum funds, and alleged that several promises the TRS made through in its electoral manifestos – 2BHK housing, unemployment allowance, loan waiver, KG to PG scheme, three acres of land to dalit community members – are just a record of how Mr. Rao cheated people. While the late Chief Minister worked for the poor, the present party leaders are being bought by the ruling TRS, she alleged, and advised that a vote to Congress is as good as voting for the TRS. “And a vote to YSRTP is to bring back YSR rule in Telangana,” she said, asserting her Telangana identity. During the yatra, Chakalisheerpally village sarpanch Mallamma recalled the works done under YSR rule. She said that she is joining the YSRTP in protest against the government’s continued neglect and recent developments in the village. Meanwhile, Ms. Sharmila appointed several party leaders as State secretaries for Nakrekal, Jadcherla, Uppal, Khammam, Chandrayangutta, Qutbullapur, Medak and Chevella constituencies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/kcr-neglected-all-sectors-alleges-ys-sharmila/article37296148.ece

Meanwhile, farmers staged protests in Miryalaguda. While one demand was requesting officials to allow their paddy stock, which was hit by unseasonal rainfall while in queue Sunday night, the other was against the alleged unfair trade practice by millers. According to farmers from mandals in Suryapet, they did not have any information about crop cutting and regulations for sale of paddy in Miryalaguda. Hundreds of farmers, who turned desperate after their produce was hit by rain, were seen requesting police officers to allow them. Groups of farmers who sat in protests around Shettipalem also alleged unfair practices by millers through weighment or by offering less than the declared minimum support price of Rs. 1,940 per quintal. Pat for police officer Meanwhile, farmers appreciated Miryalaguda rural police officer Sudheer Kumar for standing with them in the dire situation. Footage of the situation in which Mr. Kumar was seen questioning a rice miller for his alleged malpractice, of paying less than the MSP., and not recording the payment figures, went viral on social media. Meanwhile, Nalgonda police, in an attempt to de-congest the rice mill areas of the tractors to ensure smooth procurement, appealed to farmers to strictly follow a token system. Earlier, it also appealed to them to follow a crop-cutting holiday over the weekend to clear pending vehicle queues near Miryalaguda. On Monday, the police reiterated that only farmers who had collected a token to cut their crop and bring their load will be allowed to mills.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/paddy-farmers-stage-protests/article37296149.ece

Special Judge Geetanjali Goel issued the notices after a revision petition was filed in the court challenging an August 11 order by a trial court discharging Mr. Kejriwal and 10 other accused in the case, calling it “erroneous”. The revision plea, filed through advocate Kumar Vaibhav, stated that the trial court had erroneously discharged the 11 accused and that Metropolitan Magistrate Sachin Gupta had carried out a “miscarriage of justice” by not looking into the statements in the case. On August 11, the court had discharged the CM and 10 other accused in the case where Mr. Prakash, who was then the Chief Secretary, was allegedly manhandled by AAP legislators at a meeting. The prosecution had told the court that the alleged assault occurred at Mr. Kejriwal’s residence where the 11 MLAs were having a meeting with Mr. Prakash. The court had, however, ordered framing of charges against AAP MLAs Amanatullah Khan and Prakash Jarwal in the matter.

02 November 2021||washington,||Pentagon rattled by China’s military push||China’s growing military muscle and its drive to end American predominance in the Asia-Pacific is rattling the U.S. defence establishment. American officials see trouble quickly accumulating on multiple fronts — Beijing’s expanding nuclear arsenal, its advances in space, cyber and missile technologies, and threats to Taiwan. “The pace at which China is moving is stunning,” says Gen. John Hyten, the second-highest ranking officer in the U.S. military, who previously commanded the U.S. nuclear forces and oversaw the Air Force space operations. At stake is a potential shift in the global balance of power that has favoured the U.S. for decades. A realignment more favourable to China does not pose a direct threat to the U.S. but could complicate U.S. alliances in Asia. New signs of how the Pentagon intends to deal with the China challenge may emerge in the coming weeks from Biden administration policy reviews on nuclear weapons, global troop basing and overall defence strategy. For now, officials marvel at how Beijing is marshalling the resources, technology and political will to make rapid gains — so rapid that the Biden administration is attempting to reorient all aspects of U.S. foreign and defence policy. The latest example of surprising speed was China’s test of a hypersonic weapon capable of partially orbiting Earth before re-entering the atmosphere and gliding on a manoeuvrable path to its target. The weapon system’s design is meant to evade U.S. missile defences, and although Beijing insisted it was testing a reusable space vehicle, not a missile, the test appeared to have startled U.S. officials. Sputnik moment Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the test was “very close” to being a Sputnik moment, akin to the 1957 launching by the Soviet Union of the world’s first space satellite, which caught the world by surprise. Gen. Milley and other U.S. officials have declined to discuss details of the Chinese test, saying they are secret. He called it “very concerning” for the U.S. but added that problems posed by China’s military modernisation run far deeper. “That’s just one weapon system,” he said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “The Chinese military capabilities are much greater than that. They’re expanding rapidly in space, in cyber and then in the traditional domains of land, sea and air.” On the nuclear front, private satellite imagery in recent months has revealed large additions of launch silos that suggest the possibility that China plans to increase its fleet of land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs. Pentagon officials and defence hawks on Capitol Hill point to China’s modernisation as a key justification for rebuilding the U.S. nuclear arsenal, a project expected to cost more than $1 billion over 30 years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pentagon-rattled-by-chinas-military-push/article37295571.ece
02 November 2021||Tokyo,||Japan’s PM Fumio Kishida calls victory after ‘tough’ election||Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida declared victory on Monday after his ruling coalition won a strong majority in national elections, vowing to boost the virus-hit economy and “take a leading role” in Asia’s push towards carbon neutrality. Mr. Kishida, a soft-spoken centrist who has been in office for a month, said he would set out plans for a pandemic spending package this month in a bid to revive the world’s third-largest economy. Before heading to the COP26 summit, Mr. Kishida said he was committed to climate targets set by his predecessor Yoshihide Suga. “We will not only stand firm on our 2050 carbon-neutral goal but also take a leading role in working towards zero emissions in Asia,” he said. The long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its junior coalition partner Komeito won 293 of the 465 seats in Parliament’s Lower House, local media reported while the official result was finalised. The coalition had previously held 305 seats. “It was a very tough election, but the people’s will — that they want us to create this country’s future under the stable LDP-Komeito government and the Kishida administration — was shown,” Mr. Kishida said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/japans-pm-fumio-kishida-calls-victory-after-tough-election/article37295566.ece
02 November 2021||London,||U.K. vows action if France does not back down in fishing row||Britain on Monday warned France it will take action if Paris does not withdraw “unreasonable” threats to impose trade measures in an increasingly acrimonious row over post-Brexit fishing rights. President Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday that Britain must give ground in the dispute or France will trigger trade reprisals on Tuesday, saying: “The ball is in Britain’s court.” But Britain’s Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told Sky News on Monday that “we will use the mechanisms of our trade agreement with the EU to take action” if Mr. Macron goes ahead with his plans. “The French have made completely unreasonable threats, including to the Channel Islands and to our fishing industry, and they need to withdraw those threats,” she said. “If somebody behaves unfairly in a trade deal you’re entitled to take action against them and seek some compensatory measures. And that is what we will do if the French don’t back down.” Angry Paris France is angry that Britain and the Channel Islands of Jersey and Guernsey have not issued some French boats with licences to fish in their waters since Brexit took full effect at the start of 2021. Paris has vowed that, unless licences are approved, it will ban U.K. boats from unloading their catches at French ports from Tuesday and impose checks on all products brought to France from Britain. Jersey’s Minister for External Relations Ian Gorst said on Monday that his officials had followed the terms of the Brexit deal, which stipulates that boats should only be granted licences if evidence is presented that they fished in the waters before 2016. “We’ve really tumbled over ourselves to be as engaging and as reasonable as possible,” he told Sky News.   Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson complained to EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on Saturday that French threats over fishing were “completely unjustified” as he held out the option of invoking the Brexit dispute tool for the first time, drawing the EU itself into the row.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/uk-vows-action-if-france-does-not-back-down-in-fishing-row/article37295568.ece
02 November 2021||COLOMBO,||Sri Lanka fisher leaders meet Indian envoy||The Indian High Commissioner in Colombo on Monday assured Sri Lanka’s northern fishermen that he would convey their concerns over bottom trawling by Indian fishermen in the Palk Strait to both New Delhi and Tamil Nadu and look at some immediate measures to address the problem. A delegation of fisher leaders from Sri Lanka’s northern districts, along with Jaffna legislator M.A. Sumanthiran, met Indian High Commissioner Gopal Baglay in Colombo on Monday, and voiced concern over the “delay in India’s response” to the issue of bottom trawling in the Palk Strait. The meeting was consequent to a recent discussion, held when High Commissioner Baglay called on Tamil National Alliance (TNA) leader R. Sampanthan last week, according to TNA spokesman Mr. Sumanthiran, who was also at the meeting. “The fisher community leaders recalled that the Indian side had agreed twice — in 2010 and 2016 — to phase out and end the practice of bottom trawling. But it has not ended yet,” the Jaffna MP told The Hindu, after Monday's meeting. A fortnight ago, northern Sri Lankan fishermen held a sea rally, demanding that Sri Lanka implement its laws against bottom trawling, a destructive fishing method that erodes the seabed, endangering marine organisms. Dozens of boats with black flags travelled 100 km from the north-eastern Mullaitivu town to Point Pedro in Jaffna, with some TNA MPs joining the protest. Fishermen from Tamil Nadu crossing the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) and fishing in Sri Lankan waters, using the harmful bottom trawling fishing method, has been a recurring flashpoint in India-Sri Lanka ties. “The High Commissioner listened to the fisher leaders' grievances and told them that he would convey their sentiments to both New Delhi and Tamil Nadu. He agreed that while long term solutions are taking time, it is important to come up with some short-term measures meanwhile,” Mr. Sumanthiran said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/sri-lanka-fisher-leaders-meet-indian-envoy/article37295573.ece
02 November 2021||Nairobi,||Abiy defiant as rival Tigray forces make advance||Ethiopia’s Prime Minister has called on citizens to redouble efforts to combat the rival Tigray forces who claim to have seized key cities on a major highway leading to the capital, while a new wave of detentions of ethnic Tigrayans has begun. A move on Addis Ababa is a new phase in the war that has killed thousands of people since fighting broke out a year ago between Ethiopian and allied forces and Tigray ones who long dominated the national government before Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took office in 2018. His spokeswoman, Billene Seyoum, said on Monday that Mr. Abiy “is where he’s meant to be, leading the country’s front and centre”. Mr. Abiy, in a statement on Sunday, said federal troops are fighting on four fronts against the Tigray forces and “we should know that our enemy’s main strength is our weakness and unpreparedness”. Amid calls for attacks agai- nst ethnic Tigrayans, he said “we should closely follow those who work for the enemy and live amongst us”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/abiy-defiant-as-rival-tigray-forces-make-advance/article37295569.ece
02 November 2021||Islamabad,||Islamists call off rally after talks with Pak. govt.||A banned Pakistani Islamist party on Monday called off a march to the capital and ended its occupation of a major highway after reaching a deal with the government, following more than a week of clashes that left seven policemen dead. The Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) was protesting over the detention of its leader, arrested in April when the group was outlawed by authorities, and was demanding the expulsion of the French Ambassador from Pakistan over publication of blasphemous caricatures.  Several thousand supporters had begun a stop-start march from the eastern city of Lahore to the capital Islamabad, reaching about one third of the way. “We have called off our march to Islamabad after reaching an agreement with the government,” Sajjad Saifi, a spokesman for the TLP, said. “Our supporters have moved to the nearby park and until 50% of terms are fulfilled we will stay here,” he added. The government has refused to comment on the details of the talks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/islamists-call-off-rally-after-talks-with-pak-govt/article37295567.ece
02 November 2021||Kabul,||In Afghan hospital, unpaid doctors and Taliban clash||The Taliban-appointed supervisor of a small district hospital outside the Afghan capital has big plans for the place — to the dismay of the doctors who work there. Mohammed Javid Ahmadi, 22, was asked by his superiors, fresh off the fields of battle from a war that has spanned most of his life, what kind of jobs he could do. It was Ahmadi’s dream to be a doctor; poverty had kept him from gaining admission to medical school, he said. He chose the health sector. Soon after, the Mirbacha Kot District Hospital just outside of Kabul became his responsibility.  Different priorities It’s a job Ahmadi takes very seriously, but he and the other health workers in the 20-bed hospital rarely see eye-to-eye. Doctors are demanding overdue salary payments amid critical shortages of medicine, fuel and food. Ahmadi’s first priority is to build a mosque inside the hospital quarters, segregate staff by gender and encourage them to pray. The rest will follow according to the will of God, he tells them. The drama in Mirbacha Kot is playing out across Afghanistan’s health sector since the Taliban takeover. With power changing hands overnight, health workers have had to contend with a difficult adjustment. The host of problems that preceded the Taliban’s rise were exacerbated.   In Mirbacha Kot, doctors have not been paid in five months.  “What can we do? If we don’t want to come here there’s no other job for us. If there was another job, nobody can pay us. It’s better to stay here,” said Dr. Gul Nazar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/in-afghan-hospital-unpaid-doctors-and-taliban-clash/article37295570.ece

02 November 2021||November 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Why counting caste matters||The debate about whether the decennial Census should collect data on caste from individuals who fall into the administrative categories of ‘General’ and ‘Other Backward Classes’ (OBCs) has been argued by public intellectuals, politicians, and government administrators for decades. As the Census currently only collects data on ‘Scheduled Castes’ (SCs) and ‘Scheduled Tribes’ (STs), it fails to provide comprehensive data on India’s graded caste hierarchy. In the run-up to the 2011 Census, the political leadership agreed to include a full caste count in the Census. It later prevented a caste-wise enumeration in the Census. The suppression of caste-wise data took place then because of two interconnected dynamics which are likely to reoccur unless they are collectively challenged. The importance of caste data First, caste elites generally believe that caste no longer matters in shaping opportunities and outcomes in the 21st century. This caste blindness, or castelessness, obscures caste privileges and conceals sources of multi-generational structural advantage. Many caste elites view the collection of caste data about anyone but the most disadvantaged as unnecessary and a misuse of public resources. This perspective both serves their own interests and ignores the relational nature of caste — that is, the same societal institutions, systems, and cultural norms that have led to historic and ongoing subjugation of oppressed castes have simultaneously empowered others. To understand the full scope of disadvantage, we must also examine the full scope of privilege and advantage. The suppression also occurred as a result of the machinery of government. Organisations tasked with designing Census questions and overseeing data collection, similar to every other key institution in society, have caste-based inequalities entrenched within them. The bureaucracy blocked the inclusion of a full caste count in the Census 2011 on methodological grounds. It argued that a caste count would be “administratively difficult and cumbersome,” “jeopardise the whole exercise,” and “compromise the basic integrity of the Census”. The official language used by the Congress-led government in 2011 was identical to the language used in the affidavit filed in the Supreme Court on September 23, 2021 by the present BJP-led government. The presentation of (supposedly) insurmountable methodological and logistical challenges is particularly effective as an excuse because it silences non-experts. Caste elites have a numerical and cultural stranglehold over the upper bureaucracy, despite more than 70 years of Central government reservations. In 2019, out of the 82 Secretaries to the Government of India, only four were SCs or STs. Following the suppression of the caste count in Census 2011, the executive bureaucracy reconfigured the Below Poverty Line survey and renamed it the 2011 Socio-Economic Caste Census, which had little resemblance to the original demands by caste census advocates and produced unusable caste data. The purpose for collecting caste-wise data in the decennial Census is to understand the contours of inequality. These data are crucial to understand how caste intersects with class, gender, and regionality to structure access to resources. The collected caste data should be publicly available for use. In this regard, the caste data would continue the existing practice of the Office of the Registrar General of India to make Census data publicly available. The Census has the legal standing, public trust, operational expertise, and resources to collect, analyse, and make public caste data. Caste data must be collected as part of this constitutionally required exercise. Having the caste Census as part of another state project, or overseen by nodal agencies other than the ORGI, as happened 10 years ago, will relegate it to parts of the bureaucracy with insufficient expertise in a nationwide data collection operation. While counting (or not counting) caste is political, the decision should not be reduced to immediate political contingencies i.e., the expansion of reservation policies, the caste-based mobilisation by political parties, etc. In the absence of detailed caste data, we fail to name and confront major structural and foundational problems of society; leave space for opportunistic politicians to exploit each caste; and miss the opportunity to craft reasoned, data-driven, and inclusive public policies. Addressing concerns Yet, important concerns remain. Some progressive and anti-caste scholars fear that a full-caste count will further entrench caste identities. A caste census will require all households to think about, acknowledge, and speak about caste identities. Yet, historically outcast groups have already had to provide caste data in all postcolonial Censuses to implement reservations. A full caste-wise enumeration will help to make visible privileges and resources that have become over time disassociated with caste, despite historical, sociological, and economic evidence to the contrary. Updated data on the entire caste system, including its intersections with other identities, will provide a more complete picture of exclusion and inequality in India. Another concern is that groups will misuse the caste data. But misuse of caste data already takes place. Private groups with access to money and power regularly collect caste data for their needs. Political parties map the caste and religious composition of neighborhoods, cities, and villages to mobilise votes. Collecting caste data in the decennial Census removes this private power by making caste data publicly available to all. While methodological and logistical challenges are real, they are surmountable. Demographers in government agencies and universities have extensive experience working through these challenges. Sample surveys such as the India Human Development Survey have collected caste-wise data. In addition, research on the failed caste count suggests the importance of careful planning to prevent groups from being made invisible in the data, such as Dalit Muslims, Dalit Christians, inter-caste and inter-religious households (particularly those that cut across the line of ‘untouchability’ or communal divide), and LGBTQ+ individuals. Related to the discussion of castelessness, if a ‘no caste’ option is included in the Census, the caste count will likely undercount well-to-do caste elites. Given the purpose of the caste count, omissions of marginalised groups and elites require specific attention while designing the survey instrument, training enumerators, educating the public, and analysing collected caste-wise data. Hence, the entire process requires external oversight if the data are to be usable and to minimise potential harm. As the process unfolds, a public oversight group should work to ensure that major operational and methodological decisions align with the data collection’s purpose: to understand the scope of caste-based inequities and address structural inequalities. Anti-caste organisations and public intellectuals, who have devoted their life’s work to challenging caste hierarchy, must provide oversight and input. Their perspectives and lived experiences of fighting caste oppression are the best safeguards to ensure that the collected data will be used for liberatory purposes.

02 November 2021||November 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Kashmir’s fragility has more complex reasons||Fear is the prevailing sentiment across many parts of Kashmir today. It has, in turn, led to comparisons with the situation that existed during the 1990s and the early years of the 21st century. In the past few weeks, several civilians as well as security and armed forces personnel, have been killed by terrorists, some of the latter being labelled as hybrid terrorists, though it is not clear what this phrase signifies. Ground realities A predictable reaction to the situation has been the exodus of Hindus, especially of the Kashmiri Pandits, and of migrant labour, fearing for their lives and their future. Side by side with this, an impression has been created of increasing support to militancy, though it is unclear whether this is indeed the case. However, as in all situations of this kind, it is apparent that impressions often appear more real than actual ground realities. Latterly, Kashmir had managed to stay away from the headlines despite concerns expressed in different quarters about the ‘disciplined democracy’ being practised ever since the dilution of Article 370 and the restructuring of the erstwhile State of Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) into two Union Territories. In the absence of an agile press, it has not been possible to fathom the intensity of protests against the existing order, and whether they constitute a rejection of the changes effected. Incidents of violence have, however, continued. Notwithstanding this, given the hullabaloo in the immediate aftermath of the changes effected in August 2019, a degree of surface calm seemed to prevail, not very different from that which existed previously. Whether this was peace brought about through controlled conditions, or otherwise, has been difficult to discern. Given the recent recrudescence of violence, it is, nevertheless, evident that the situation remains fragile. Whether this means that the changes effected since August 2019 were merely a ‘triumph of wishfulness over prudence’, an overestimation of belief on what was possible ignoring the history of several decades past, and the failure of many previous attempts to change the status quo , is hence worth examining. Pakistan apart More important is what could possibly be the reasons for the revival of aggravated violence in Kashmir. While assessing the ground situation in Kashmir, Pakistan has always tended to be a factor. It is, however, again possible that the lessons of the past on what needed to be done — to effectively checkmate insurgency from across the border or inflame Kashmiri opinion — might have gone unheeded in the euphoria of having succeeded in altering the character of J&K and Delhi establishing a degree of direct control. Promises made and an unwillingness to use the time and opportunity to create fresh opportunities for dialogue with communities in Kashmir, allied with reputational interest in not accepting that the many steps taken, were inadequate to defeat the machinations from across the border, could also, perhaps, be additional reasons. By this reckoning, Kashmir might well seem, in some remote way, to reveal the same attitude as many post-conflict, pre-modern, hybrid societies with mixed populations. It would imply that in the case of Kashmir, making a transformation to a more stable society will always prove difficult. In addition, Kashmir has difficult neighbours such as Afghanistan, Pakistan and China, which leaves little scope for experimentation — a true test for decision-making of any kind. As violence escalated in J&K, it became commonplace to link it with the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. This could, however, be a highly simplistic answer to a more complex situation. In the current context, geopolitics is something that cannot and must not be ignored. The sudden surge in violence in Kashmir needs a more careful evaluation of the facts rather than simplistic answers. It is a fact, for instance, that India’s world view has steadily expanded, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, and several, including some relatively unknown, tension points have emerged. All these will need to be carefully assessed before coming up with an answer — more so since India is wedged between two known antagonists (Pakistan and China), has a Talibanised Afghanistan as its neighbour, and there has been a resurgence of international terror groups, notably the Islamic State and al-Qaeda. The China factor Of particular consequence in this context is China’s continuing cooperation with Pakistan in many matters, its growing assertiveness in regard to its territorial claims, vis-à-vis India, its opposition to the prominence given to India by the West in both Asian and global forums, etc. All these have further helped cement the nexus between China and Pakistan. Intertwined with this is again the battle raging for spheres of influence between China and India, which has intensified under China’s President Xi Jinping. The latter is intent on establishing an Asian system in which China sits at the summit of a hierarchical regional order. All this is altering the ground realities and it is worth considering whether Kashmir is emerging as a pressure point in this context. Intelligence is critical What it all boils down to is the need for hard and better intelligence. Hard intelligence is critical to avoid misperceptions and miscalculations. The (recent) history of the world is replete with stories of intelligence failures, misperceptions and miscalculations, which had led to grave situations, and which might well have been avoided had there been better intelligence. The serious miscalculation about Iraqi President Saddam Hussein possessing nuclear weapons based on wrong intelligence led to unnecessary involvement by the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Iraq, followed by an unfortunate train of events that continues to haunt the world to this day. As tensions between India and China, and between India and Pakistan, intensify, the need for hard intelligence is thus vital to be able to control the train of events and avoid any serious miscalculations. What is common to most, perhaps all, intelligence agencies — irrespective of their degrees of competence — is their limited capacity for imagination, viz. , to imagine future events and possibilities. Intelligence agencies, by and large, are adept at providing insights about yesterday’s threats rather than future ones, specially those that exist just beyond the horizon. Moreover, as intelligence agencies become more wedded to technology, they need to realise that advances in technology tend to be a double-edged sword insofar as intelligence is concerned. It should not negate the need for improved analysis and also how important it is to provide decision-makers with information on what is taking place in the minds of their opposite numbers. In the extant situation, Indian intelligence agencies must avoid the kind of lapses of both imagination and analysis displayed by western intelligence agencies some years ago, who misread, misunderstood and failed to anticipate the role of Sayyid Qutb and his preachings which later set the stage for the 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers in New York and other targets in the U.S. Had they understood what Sayyid Qutb preached, viz. , that martyrdom was a necessary part of 20th century jihad, they would not have underestimated the influence exerted by Islamist theology on the terrorist mindset. It is, thus, important that the ‘missing dimensions’ of intelligence in most cases, viz. , thinking imaginatively and improved analytical capabilities, receive the close attention of India’s intelligence agencies. Only then will it be possible to understand the nature of current events as a precursor of future threats. This is important to ensure that they do not ignore signals that may not be all too obvious at this time, and keep chasing more obvious and current aspects. Too narrowly focussed intelligence requirements, limited to current events such as, for example, tensions with China on the border, or Pakistan’s attempts to push in ‘irregulars’ and aid the Lashkar and Jaish elements to cross over into India, may prove self-defeating. The arc of intelligence needs to be much wider and Indian intelligence agencies such as the Intelligence Bureau, the Research & Analysis Wing as also the National Security Council Secretariat should ensure that they have the necessary capabilities. Linked to this is also the danger of ‘intelligence adjustment’, viz. , avoiding challenging conventional assumptions, which could undermine their ability to provide a more accurate picture of the larger threat. Today, when India faces problems all around it, to limit what is happening in Kashmir solely to the impetus created by a Talibanised Afghanistan without fully analysing all the facts could cost the country dear.

02 November 2021||November 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Finding a way out of India’s deepening water stress||The complexity and scale of the water crisis in India calls for a locus specific response, that can galvanise and integrate the ongoing work of different Ministries and Departments through new configurations. Such an integrated approach must necessarily cut across sectoral boundaries and not stop at the merger achieved between the two Ministries of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation and the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, which led to the formation of the Ministry of Jal Shakti in 2019. Understanding sources used Seeing India’s looming water crisis through the locus of ‘urban’ and ‘rural’ not only allows a better grasp of the causative factors but also enables a stronger grip on the strategies to be deployed to reverse the water crisis. Fundamental to this is a preliminary understanding of the sources from which the country draws water to meet its varying needs. In the rural areas, 80%-90% of the drinking water and 75% of the water used for agriculture is drawn from groundwater sources. In urban areas, 50%-60% of the water supply is drawn from groundwater sources, whereas the remaining is sourced from surface water resources such as rivers, often located afar, in addition to lakes, tanks and reservoirs. According to the composite water management index released by the think tank NITI Aayog in 2019, 21 major cities (including Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad) were on the brink of exhausting groundwater resources, affecting about 100 million people. The study also points out that by 2030, the demand for water is projected to be twice the available supply. The Chennai example A significant, and by no means less worrying, example of the water crisis that unfolded before our eyes was in Chennai in 2019, where life came to a standstill and parts of the city went without piped water for months. Though this may well have been forgotten, Chennai remains a spectacle of the impending tragedies brought about by the city’s inability to meet the basic needs of citizens, vis-à-vis drinking water, cooking and sanitation. A closer look at the factors that brought about the water crisis in Chennai is inescapable, should we gain a better grasp of the underlying problems, especially as this was a city which among others like Mumbai had suffered from floods previously. Many have cited the poor rainfall received in Chennai in the previous year as one of the main reasons for the water crisis. Though it is true that rainfall was low, which was 50% less than normal, focusing on this factor alone would absolve responsibility by blaming the vagaries of the rainfall patterns to a fast-changing climate, without understanding the ground-level steps (or missteps) which have been equally responsible factors. Chief among these is that the city has been built by incrementally encroaching floodplains and paving over lakes and wetlands that would have otherwise helped the process of recharging groundwater. The lack of space for water to percolate underground prevented rainwater from recharging the aquifers. This was further exacerbated by the loss of green cover (which would have otherwise helped water retention) to make way for infrastructure projects. Such a situation, on the one hand, leads to flooding during normal rainfall due to stagnation, and on the other hand leads to drought-like conditions due to the prevention of underground water storage. It is only that this situation was more magnified in Chennai, but other cities in India would echo these manifestations in varying degrees owing to a lack of sustainable urban planning. There is also the example, in Mumbai, in 2019, when 2,141 trees were felled at the Aarey colony, amid massive protests, to make space for a shed for the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Limited. Need for synergy If the Government is serious about addressing the water crisis in urban areas, the Ministry of Water Resources must reconfigure its relationship with other Ministries and Departments (Urban Development, Local Self-Government and Environment). This would be for enhanced integration and coordination through effective land and water zoning regulations that protect urban water bodies, groundwater sources, wetlands and green cover while simultaneously working to enhance waste water recycling and water recharge activities targeting aquifers and wells through rainwater harvesting. Lessons from rural Punjab In rural areas, the situation is no different, as the acute water crisis in Punjab shows. The draft report of the Central Ground Water Board concluded that Punjab would be reduced to a desert in 25 years if the extraction of its groundwater resources continues unabated; 82% of Punjab’s land area has seen a huge decline in groundwater levels, wherein 109 out of 138 administrative blocks have been placed in the ‘over exploited’ category. Groundwater extraction which was at 35% in the 1960s and 1970s, rose to 70% post the Green Revolution — a period which saw governments subsidising power for irrigation that left tubewells running for hours. Concomitantly, cultivation of water intensive crops such as paddy have further aggravated water depletion, even turning water saline. Immediate measures need to be taken to manage and replenish groundwater, especially through participatory groundwater management approaches with its combination of water budgeting, aquifer recharging and community involvement. Such an approach to water conservation again beckons new configurations between sectors and disciplines. At the sectoral level, the Ministries and Departments of water resources must coordinate efforts with their counterparts in agriculture, the environment and rural development for greater convergence to achieve water and food security. At the disciplinary level, governance and management should increasingly interact and draw from the expertise of fields such as hydrology (watershed sustainability), hydrogeology (aquifer mapping and recharge) and agriculture sciences (water-sensitive crop choices and soil health). Again, the importance given to groundwater conservation should not ignore surface water conservation including the many rivers and lakes which are in a critical and dying state due to encroachment, pollution, over-abstraction and obstruction of water flow by dams. Protecting resources The Ministry of Jal Shakti, last year, had announced an ambitious plan to provide water connections to every household in India by 2024. In view of the ongoing erosion of water resources and an ever-increasing demand for water, the thrust should not be on promising water supply. Instead the aim should be towards protecting and conserving water resources on the one hand and minimising and enhancing efficiency of water usage on the other. As the expert committee constituted under the Union Water Resources Ministry drafts a new National Water Policy, one hopes it would be rooted in locus specific realities and allows greater flexibility for integrating the insights and work of multiple departments and disciplines making way for new configurations to sustainably manage the country’s water resources.

02 November 2021||November 02 2021 00:00 IST,||The crypto conundrum||Bitcoin and other private cryptocurrencies have been on a bull run recently. Unlike previous rallies, the current rally in bitcoin has witnessed the increasing participation of retail investors in India. Since 2020, when the Supreme Court overturned an order by the Reserve Bank of India dated April 6, 2018, restricting the use of cryptocurrencies, traffic in domestic cryptocurrency exchanges in India has grown many-fold. Yet, the future of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is unlikely to be as bright as many believe it to be. A case of speculative mania? The most important feature of cryptocurrencies that is flaunted by their enthusiasts is their limited supply. In a world where central banks create a lot of money out of thin air, it is natural for investors who are looking to protect their wealth to seek abode in alternative assets whose supply cannot be cranked up as easily. Money creation by central banks causes the price of all goods to rise and also tends to accelerate the adoption of alternative assets as currencies. When central banks create a lot of money, it leads to an increase in the prices of not just goods such as food and cars but also that of commodities such as gold and silver, considered to be alternative forms of money. Yet, for various reasons, the rally in bitcoin may be no more than a case of speculative mania. For one, scarcity alone is not sufficient to facilitate the adoption of cryptocurrencies as money. Any asset must have either use value or exchange value in order for it to possess any fundamental value. This fundamental value, in turn, is reflected in the price of these assets in the long run. Stocks and bonds, for instance, possess exchange value that is based on the expected future cash flow from these assets. Commodities such as oil and steel possess use value because these assets are used to run vehicles and build real estate. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may be scarce but it is questionable whether they possess any use value or exchange value. Gold and silver have traditionally served as hedges against inflation because they possess fundamental value derived from their use as jewellery and money. But bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies neither offer direct use value nor possess significant exchange value — bitcoin can buy you very few real goods and services. In short, cryptocurrencies possess no significant fundamental value to sustain their current high prices. Yet, many believe that the rising prices of cryptocurrencies reflect their likely future value as a currency. It is possible that investors are bidding up the price of bitcoin because they foresee a future in which private currency is widely accepted as money. After all, all investments are forward-looking. One may also grant that the extreme volatility seen in the price of cryptocurrencies, which seems unrelated to any similar fluctuations in their fundamentals, may be due to the nascent, illiquid nature of the cryptocurrency market. However, the more cryptocurrencies are accepted in exchange for goods and services, the greater the chances of governments cracking down on them. Issuance of money The monopoly that governments (and central banks) possess over the issuance of money is at the root of their power and influence. This allows governments to fund their budget deficits, particularly during times of crises such as the current pandemic when tax revenues have taken an unprecedented hit. It also allows central banks to tinker with the money supply under the mandate of managing aggregate demand in the economy. In essence, monopoly control over money allows governments to indirectly tax citizens by increasing the supply of currencies, thus devaluing them. If cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are going to challenge fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar as a medium of exchange, they would essentially be challenging the authority of the government to print and spend. This is not an assault that governments will tolerate for long. They will allow cryptocurrencies to exist only as long as these currencies remain a speculative asset and not a medium of exchange. This is not to say that governments are justified in their crackdown against cryptocurrencies. China recently imposed a complete ban on all cryptocurrencies and plans to issue its own central bank-issued digital currency. Private alternatives to fiat currencies offer people greater choice in what currencies they choose to use as a medium of exchange. The benefits of free market competition in money were elaborated by economist Friedrich Hayek in The Denationalization of Money . Most notably, competition between currencies to cater to the demands of customers would ensure that fiat currencies that are printed indiscriminately simply go out of use. This is the outcome that governments fear and would fight to avoid at any cost. prashanthperumal.j@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-crypto-conundrum/article37295564.ece
02 November 2021||November 02 2021 00:00 IST,||The TDP’s search for a friend||There are no permanent friends and permanent enemies in politics. Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief N. Chandrababu Naidu is clearly on a mission to revive his old friendship with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the Centre. In the hope of bringing back glory to the ailing TDP and to protect it from the ruling YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) back home, Mr. Naidu is making every effort he can to join hands with an old friend which his party has ignored at the cost of repeated setbacks in the last few years. Looking for an ally The TDP’s growing desperation for a strong ally has been quite obvious in Mr. Naidu’s words and deeds. Recently, in an interview to this newspaper, when asked whether he was open to exploring a return to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), Mr. Naidu said: “We must explore it, otherwise others will exploit us.” This is an indication that he is worried about the BJP-YSRCP friendship. The BJP, in fact, had wanted the YSRCP in the Union Cabinet but the regional party has always been averse to it, being content, instead, with extending issue-based support to the BJP. Two weeks ago, after the TDP’s offices were attacked by miscreants, Mr. Naidu alleged that party persons were being targeted by YSRCP-backed mobs and requested Union Home Minister Amit Shah to deploy Central forces to ensure adequate security to the party’s offices. The TDP’s tie-up with the BJP in 2014 had been successful. The TDP had gained from the anti-Congress sentiment following the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh as well as the ‘Modi wave’. The alliance was strongly supported by the popular actor, Pawan Kalyan. But trouble started brewing between the partners in 2018 over the issue of central funding to the State. Mr. Naidu was also upset that the Centre was not granting special category status to Andhra Pradesh and finally snapped ties with the NDA. The BJP argued then that it had always been willing to grant the monetary equivalent of special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Mr. Kalyan launched a scathing attack against the State government, which TDP ministers alleged was being done at the behest of the BJP. Patching up After this fallout, Mr. Naidu started exploring alliances with the Congress and other parties, but these were unsuccessful. And so, Mr. Naidu was forced to wage a lone battle in the 2019 polls and met with an embarrassing defeat in the hands of the YSRCP. Post this debacle, Mr. Naidu has expressed regret — both in public and in private meetings with party members — for snapping ties with the NDA. During the post-poll meet of the party, Mr. Naidu said that he had nothing against the BJP and that his decisions were purely aimed at protecting the interests of the State. Over the years, Mr. Naidu’s softened stand can be seen in his appreciation for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In April 2020, for instance, Mr. Naidu hailed Mr. Modi for taking a “bold and statesman-like decision” to extend the COVID-19 lockdown. But the patch up with the BJP is not going to be easy. It might be hard for the BJP to ignore the two betrayals of the TDP — first after the 2004 polls when Mr. Naidu blamed and deserted the BJP after losing to Congress’s Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy; and the second in 2018, when the TDP snapped ties with the NDA. In 2019, Mr. Shah had said firmly that the doors of the NDA would be permanently shut for the TDP. The party re-iterated this stand last month. Yet, anything is possible, says a senior BJP leader in the State on the condition of anonymity. After all, the Congress, a foe, suddenly became a friend for the TDP in 2018. For the TDP, whose prospects seem bleak in the short term, finding an ally is crucial. appaji.r@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-tdps-search-for-a-friend/article37295558.ece
02 November 2021||November 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Time for action||At their first in-person meeting in two years, leaders of the G20 did not shy away from re-engaging with the biggest issues facing the global community today, including the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, a major tax agreement, and steps to address concerns regarding global economic growth and stability. On coordinated efforts to mitigate the pandemic, the focus was on vaccine production and distribution, with assurances of support to WHO’s target of inoculating 40% or more of the global population against COVID-19 by 2021, and at least 70% by mid-2022. The implicit assumption in this commitment by G20 leaders is that initiatives to boost the supply of vaccines in developing countries will succeed, and cooperation will help the world overcome supply and financing constraints. On climate change, the Group leaders recommitted their nations to providing $100 billion a year toward adaptation, mitigation, and green technologies, focusing on the needs of developing countries. However, in this sphere, a divergence of views still exists across developing and developed nations: ahead of this summit and the 2021 climate conference in Glasgow, India had rejected the call to announce a target of zero emissions. Prime Minister Narendra Modi appears to have scored a victory in this regard as the post-summit communiqué commits the G20 to limiting global warming to 1.5° C and identified sustainable and responsible consumption and production as “critical enablers”. The world community is on shakier footing regarding the fragile post-COVID economic recovery underway after paralysing lockdowns. Unsurprisingly, given the rising inflation, spiking energy prices, and alarming supply chain bottlenecks, G20 leaders were quick to affirm that national stimulus policies would not be removed prematurely. Even so, it would remain a challenge to walk the tightrope between preserving financial stability and fiscal sustainability. Perhaps in a bid to avoid potentially debilitating wobbles in global finance, the G20 leadership agreed to slap multinationals with a minimum 15% tax to create “a more stable and fairer international tax system”. This would impact the tech titans of Silicon Valley, as this initiative would make it harder for such companies to benefit from locating themselves in relatively lower-tax jurisdictions. This OECD-led reform enjoys the support of 136 countries, which account for more than 90% of global GDP, and is likely to enter into force in 2023 or after. Nations such as the U.S. are divided on whether to approve this proposal domestically, and unless there is unanimity amongst the discussants, the initiative risks facing implementation delays. The G20 meeting has come at a critical moment for the global political economy. If it results in timely, effective, coordinated action across major nations, hope for recovery will remain afloat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/time-for-action/article37295541.ece
02 November 2021||November 02 2021 00:00 IST,||A vote for stability||Defying expectations, Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) stormed to an outright majority in the country’s parliamentary elections on Sunday. The elections were the first major test for the new Prime Minister, Fumio Kishida, who took over last month amid enormous challenges. He followed the short-lived tenure of Yoshihide Suga, who succeeded Shinzo Abe. Japan’s longest serving Prime Minister, Mr. Abe stepped down in 2020 citing health reasons. Mr. Suga’s year-long term was marred by his government’s poor handling of COVID-19 and economic woes. Facing the lowest approval ratings of any Japanese leader in years, he resigned. Entering the election in these circumstances, the LDP, which held 276 seats in the 465-seat House of Representatives before the polls, was bracing for a poor show, with wide expectations that it would need to rely on its coalition with the Komeito party to cross the halfway mark. But it coasted to victory unencumbered by coalition considerations. Mr. Kishida now has to deliver on a range of pressing challenges, including the pandemic, the economy and on the security front, relations with China. He has committed to bolstering support to hospitals to ensure a far better response should Japan face another wave. On the economy front, he has put forward a “new capitalism” aimed at an economic revival keeping the interests of the middle class as a priority. He has pledged to come up with an ambitious stimulus package this month. On foreign policy, he will have to keep in mind the wishes of his party’s conservative bloc which is calling for significant increases in defence spending. Those are voices he cannot ignore considering that the new leader— Mr. Kishida was also a Foreign Minister — has no real popular support to call upon and will be beholden to what his party wants. In the election campaign, the LDP said it would double defence spending to 2% of the GDP. China’s recent air incursions into Taiwan were cited as one major reason, as also North Korea’s missile tests. Mr. Kishida has said he will focus on shoring up relations with Washington, and in his early days, has already reached out to the leaders of the Quad. He has also spoken with China’s President Xi Jinping, with positive noises about getting relations on track. Ultimately, matters at home will decide which of his two predecessors Mr. Kishida ends up emulating. Given the flagging reputation of the LDP towards the end of Mr. Abe’s term and through Mr. Suga’s turbulent time in office, the vote appears to be as much an endorsement for stability as it is for his government. It also reaffirms the LDP’s unchallenged position in domestic politics regardless of the troubles it has faced in recent years, underlining there is no serious challenger to its continued dominance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-vote-for-stability/article37295542.ece

The Defence Ministry spokesman, who disclosed the operation to-day [New Delhi, Nov. 1], did not say in so many words that the Indian armed forces had actually crossed the border to stop this Pakistani shelling, but he pointed out that this kind of action had been taken for the first time. He said: “Kamalpur has been shelled for the last 11 days by the Pakistan forces. There have been a number of civilian casualties and many buildings damaged. Our border forces have taken some action yesterday and to-day. The result is that there will be no further trouble from the Pakistan side in this sector. We were forced to take this action to stop the Pakistani shelling.” The spokesman did not indicate the strength of forces involved on both sides in this operation. But he stressed that the fighting was confined to ground troops and that there was no air action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/punitive-action-silences-pak-troops/article37295556.ece
02 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||October manufacturing activity quickens, job losses persist: PMI||The country’s manufacturing activity expanded for the fourth month in a row in October, as reflected by the IHS Markit Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI). The survey-based PMI rose to 55.9 from 53.7 in September.  Manufacturing jobs continued to slidethough producers recorded the strongest improvement in overall operating conditions since February, and business optimism hit a six-month high. A PMI reading of 50 indicates no change in output levels. Overall new orders grew at the fastest pace in seven months, while factory output also increased at the strongest pace since March. New export orders surged as well, the quickest in three months, according to IHS Markit. Input purchases increased at the fastest pace since April, as producers geared up to cope with the surfeit of new orders. However, the cost of inputs began to pinch, with the overall inflation for them surging to a 92-month high. “Anecdotal evidence highlighted higher chemical, fabric, metal, electronic component, oil, plastic and transportation costs,” IHS Markit noted. As capacities were still not fully utilised and government norms were in place surrounding shift work, employment continued to decline. The silver lining was that the rate of job shedding was marginal in October. “With companies gearing up for further improvements in demand by building up their stocks, it looks like manufacturing activity will continue to expand throughout the third quarter of 2021-22 should the pandemic remain under control,” said Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit. She flagged input cost inflation as a worry, citing that it was “at a near 8-year high, as strong global demand for scarce raw materials continued to push up prices.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/october-manufacturing-activity-quickens-job-losses-persist-pmi/article37295854.ece

Kia India and Honda Cars also saw a fall in dispatches from a year earlier. Tata, M&M buck trend However, companies such as Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), Nissan and Skoda managed to show growth last month despite supply chain challenges. The country’s largest carmaker (MSI) said domestic sales slipped 32% to 1,17,013 units last month as against 1,72,862 units in October 2020. Rival Hyundai Motor India reported a 35% decline in domestic sales to 37,021 units. It had dispatched 56,605 units to dealers in October 2020. The global semiconductor supply constraint continues to be a challenge, resulting in lower production across the industry, it said. Kia India witnessed a 22% decline in wholesales to 16,331 units, while Honda Cars saw domestic dispatches slide 25% to 8,108. M&M said domestic passenger vehicle sales rose 8% to 20,130 units. Tata Motors reported a 44% jump in domestic passenger vehicles to 33,925 units in October compared with 23,617 a year earlier. Nissan India’s domestic wholesales rose over threefold to 3,913 units, while Skoda reported a more than twofold jump to 3,065 units.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/maruti-hyundai-october-sales-fall-on-supply-woes/article37295845.ece

However, imports grew faster to $55.37 billion, or 62.5% higher than a year ago and 45.8% over the number in October 2019.

Coal and gold imports more than doubled during October, rising by almost 119% and 104%, respectively, from a year earlier. Imports of vegetable oil also jumped by almost 60%. The trade deficit for October more than doubled from a year earlier to $19.9 billion but was lower than the record deficit of $22.6 billion in September 2021. “Encouragingly, non-oil exports rose to a seven-month high of $30.3 billion in October, 30% higher from a year ago,” said ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar. “A sustenance of healthy export growth will be crucial to contain the current account deficit in light of the recovery and commodity price-led surge in merchandise imports,” she said, adding oil imports also dipped after a spike in September.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/goods-exports-climb-42-imports-surge-63/article37295848.ece

02 November 2021||SHARJAH,||Buttler serves up yet another feast||Jos Buttler hit the first century of the ICC T20 World Cup as England effectively booked its semifinal spot with a 26-run victory over Sri Lanka on Monday. Buttler's unbeaten 101 — his maiden century in 86 T20Is — steered England to 163 for four after being invited to bat first. The bowlers, led by Adil Rashid, then combined to bowl out Sri Lanka for 137 in 19 overs and helped England win its fourth match on the trot in Group 1. Sri Lanka slipped to its third loss in four matches. Only South Africa and Australia can match its eight points, but England already has the cushion of a far superior run rate. Buttler smashed six fours and six sixes in his 67-ball knock and put on 112 with skipper Eoin Morgan, who made 40, to lift England after it was in trouble at 35 for three. The England opener, who hit an unbeaten 71 in the win over Australia, surpassed his previous T20 best of 83 and leads the batting chart with 214. “I felt like I used a lot of my experience. I remember saying a while ago, if I can put both parts of my game together then I think I'll be getting into a really good place with my T20 batting,” said Buttler. Sri Lanka had England on the backfoot but Buttler took the attack to the opposition as he reached his hundred off the final ball of the innings with a six. Leg-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga got two early wickets, that of Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow, who was trapped lbw for nought off the first ball. The right-left combination of Buttler and Morgan stood firm to grind down the Sri Lankan attack with some sensible batting. Buttler reached his fifty off 45 balls and shifted gears with some powerful hits that unsettled the Sri Lankan bowlers. Morgan joined the charge with one four and three sixes in his 36-ball knock before being bowled by Hasaranga, who returned figures of three for 21. In reply, Sri Lanka lost early wickets and was never in the chase till Shanaka (26) and Hasaranga got together. Relay catch The two put on a threatening stand of 53 for the sixth wicket before a relay catch between Roy and substitute Sam Billings sent back Hasaranga. The Lankans never recovered from that blow.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/buttler-serves-up-yet-another-feast/article37295800.ece
02 November 2021||KOZHIKODE,||Good chance for Kerala players: Yohannan||Indian cricket’s new domestic season begins on Nov. 4, the Diwali day. Since the season-opener is the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy T20 tournament, the fireworks would not be limited just to the festival. Kerala’s first match is against Gujarat at New Delhi. The others in Group D are Madhya Pradesh, Railways, Bihar and Assam. Easier group “Yes, the grouping looks easier for us compared to the last edition of the tournament, but the format is so unpredictable as India’s show at the T20 World Cup reminds us right now,” Kerala’s coach Tinu Yohannan told The Hindu on Monday. “We could take confidence from our performance in the white-ball tournaments last season.” He is also glad that the players could get to play a lot of cricket over the past few months, despite the lockdown restrictions. “The T20 tournaments organised by the Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) at Alappuzha proved such a blessing,” the former India Test pacer said. “Many cricketers have thus been able to make a comeback to the side after a long time. Players like Manu Krishnan, Abdul Basith, M.S. Akhil and Vysakh Chandran made good use of the opportunities that came their way.” Good platform Yohannan feels the T20 tournament is a good platform also for cricketers like Vishweshwar Suresh, Vatsal Govind and Sharafudeen, especially with the expanded IPL and the mega auction. “I can’t now say how many of them will get to play, but it is good to see that there is good competition for places in the eleven,” he said. “That performers like Krishna Prasad and Anand Joseph are only among the reserves shows how strong our bench is,” Yohannan said. He said the team would benefit from having a mental conditioning coach. “The players have already had a few sessions with Jody Martins,” he said. “I felt that there was a need for a qualified, experienced person like Jody. I came to know of him through coach Biju George. I am glad that the KCA appointed him for the full season,” Yohannan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/good-chance-for-kerala-players-yohannan/article37296231.ece
02 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Niki Poonacha looks to step it up on the international circuit||When he plays his best tennis, Niki Poonacha looks top class. He can hit the big serves, and whip the forehand where he likes. At his fluent best, he is a delight to watch. After being crowned the national tennis champion for the second time on Saturday in Delhi, the 26-year-old resolved to take his form and confidence into the forthcoming international circuit. “I came for the National championship looking to win it. I am happy that I was able to pull it off. After I won the ITF title, the second COVID wave took away the momentum and confidence. So, this win is important,” said Poonacha, who had won the international title at the same venue in April. “It didn’t go that great for me in the ITF events in Tunisia recently. So, this title is crucial for me. The long matches have given me the mental strength to push more and believe that I can do it,” he said. Poonacha, who had competed six weeks in Tunisia, had played with many aches and pains through the national championship, visiting physio Anand Dubey to get suitable treatment. Aches and pains “I was playing with multiple pains and aches during this week, taking pain killers before the matches. Treatment from the physio, stretching, icing helped me a lot. I just have to play with the pain — mentally block it, and focus on the match. No pain, no gain,” he said. Poonacha is quite confident about his game, but feels the need to work on the fitness, so as to capitalise on the forthcoming three ITF tournaments in Indore, Delhi and Gurugram. “I am well prepared. In fact, playing the nationals was to prepare for the international events. Winning the nationals has given me the confidence and motivation. I am focusing on recovery now and building my fitness,” Poonacha said. Poonacha trains at the Rohan Bopanna Academy at the Sports School in Bengaluru. “I am grateful to the whole team.

02 November 2021||DUBAI,||Fans asked for the dream of 2007, getting the nightmare instead||At the beginning of the T20 World Cup — when the euphoria of the Yellow Brigade regaining the IPL was still strong — loyal worshippers of the Men in Blue were anticipating a repeat of 2007 come November 14. No doubt the fans are experiencing 2007, but not the one they had hoped for. Humiliation Instead of reliving the dream of the inaugural World Twenty in September 2007, they are going through the nightmare of March 2007, when India crashed out of the league stage of the ODI World Cup in the West Indies. Back then, Rahul Dravid’s boys were knocked out after losing to Sri Lanka in the last game of a pool of four. Cut to 2021, India seems to be virtually out of contention for the semifinals following two humiliating defeats. As a result, India’s campaign is in danger of ending with the league stage on November 8. Remote chances There still is a remote possibility — winning the remaining games by big margins and other results going its way — of making the semifinals, but it appears to be rather far-fetched or merely something to keep statisticians interested. No doubt Pakistan and New Zealand deserve all credit for the way they devised plans and, more importantly, executed them. But the manner in which India — especially the batters — threw in the towel raises multiple questions. Wider discussions about workload management, bubble fatigue, thrust on all-format specialists and administrators’ approach, etc are bound to happen. But let’s keep them aside for another week. India still has to complete the tournament, and hopefully win the remaining three games to give fans some reason to cheer. Exposed  The two games exposed the fears of many about the squad composition and choice of the XI. India’s preferred top three — Rohit Sharma, K.L. Rahul and Virat Kohli — like to give themselves a few balls before unleashing their strokes. But batting yourself in has become a luxury in T20 cricket. In a format that has been evolving with every passing year, India seems to be stuck in a time warp. Despite tweaking the opening combination, India appeared to be indecisive in its approach after being asked to bat. None of the top four tried to unsettle the bowlers. Neither could they get off to a flier nor set the foundation for a late flourish. Recipe for disaster The top four on Sunday scored a combined 45 runs off 55 balls. It turned out to be a recipe made for disaster, one that will haunt the team — and the fans — for years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/fans-asked-for-the-dream-of-2007-getting-the-nightmare-instead/article37295796.ece

02 November 2021||New Delhi,||2020 Government sports awards presented||It was a return to the real world from the virtual as the Arjuna, Khel Ratna, Dhyan Chand, Dronacharya and other government sports awards were presented physically to the awardees of 2020 by the Union Sports Minister Anurag Thakur here on Monday. The awards were presented by President Ram Nath Kovind virtually last year, and the cash component had also been transferred to the accounts of the awardees then. The physical trophies were presented to the awardees on Monday in the capital. The Sports Ministry had handed over a total of 74 national sports awards, including five Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratnas and 27 Arjuna awards for 2020. There was no announcement as yet about the selection of awardees for this year, or the function to be staged for presenting the awards. The ceremony was attended by most of the awardees including Rani Rampal, Vinesh Phogat, Manu Bhaker, Saurabh Chaudhary, Mariyappan Thangavelu, Lovlina Borgohain, Atanu Das, Satwik Sairaj Rankireddy, Chirag Shetty. “The journey of the awardees doesn’t end here. There is more to be achieved. We must also continue to look for talented athletes, groom them and make them capable of winning medals at the international level. I request all the athletes to take the pledge of at least grooming and training five such athletes who can win medals for India,” said Thakur.

02 November 2021||ABU DHABI,||Pakistan — a complete package||Pakistan’s hat-trick of wins in the ongoing ICC T20 World Cup means it is close to sealing its spot in the semifinals when it takes on Namibia on Tuesday. Babar Azam’s men began by ending their India hoodoo at World Cups with a record 10-wicket win in Dubai. It has set the tone for a tournament where Pakistan’s uncharacteristic consistency and enviable chutzpah have become the hallmarks. The world’s No. 2 T20I team has a highlights reel of mesmerising bowling spells and whirling moments of brilliance with the bat, including Shaheen Afridi’s fiery new-ball assault against India in which he claimed both openers and Asif Ali’s unbeaten 25 off seven during which he hit four sixes in an over to down Afghanistan. Pakistan has played 14 T20Is in the UAE since 2016, winning each of them. But one has to sacrifice the cold objectivity of stats to better understand what the team has achieved at this World Cup so far. It isn’t the emergence of a special sporting talent; it is a team working as one. Any fan of cricket will tell you that Pakistan has always been good before finding a way to collapse. But implosion is one thing it has steered clear of this time — there were moments against New Zealand and Afghanistan when things could have gone awry, but they commanded the chase. There is a steeliness to this Pakistan side, but more importantly, there is a well-executed plan. In 2021, Babar and Mohammad Rizwan have put on 713 runs as a T20I opening pair, at an average of 59.41. Both have an understanding that if one gets out early, the other will look to bat through. After the India win, Rizwan had revealed as much. Then there’s the mercurial finisher Asif, who has proved he has the temperament, power and above all, the self-belief to shine under pressure. Against Afghanistan, he sent Shadab Khan back to stay on strike for the 19th over and backed himself to seal the chase, and he did. That, coupled with Mohammad Hafeez and Shoaib Malik’s experience, makes this a formidable batting line-up. Potent bowling Pakistan’s success has also been built on its bowling line-up. Afridi and Haris Rauf offer swing and pace. Hasan Ali and Imad Wasim are the middle-over enforcers. And Shadab brings the wily leg-spin. Buoyed by a togetherness forged in pre-tournament distractions — England and New Zealand’s last-minute pullouts — Pakistan is ready to dream and conquer. “Don’t get overexcited, it’s our habit. We need to change it,” was Babar’s address to his teammates after beating India. His troops have answered the war cry emphatically.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/pakistan-the-complete-package/article37295795.ece
02 November 2021||KOCHI,||State basketball goes for knockout format for first time||The Kerala Basketball Association is in a big hurry to conduct the State senior championship this time and it’s going to be a big challenge too. The KBA, which elected its new set of office-bearers on Sunday, has decided to conduct the State senior meet in Thiruvananthapuram from Nov. 12 to 14. The State meet used to be week-long or six-day affair earlier, with a league-cum-knockout format, but there is no time for all that this year. “We are changing the format of the State senior championship, it is going to be a knockout event this time. We have the South Zone from November 25 in Coimbatore so we don’t have much time,” C. Sasidharan, the new KBA secretary, told The Hindu on Monday evening. “The BFI (national body) has changed the format of the Nationals, it has made four zones and three from each will play the Nationals.” The KBA had an option of going for an open selection trial but decided against it. “If we conduct an open trial and select the players, the team will not be good. A lot of players are out of practice in the last two years. It’s a big challenge, we will have to see how to reduce the number of matches,” explained Sasidharan. P.J. Sunny, a former State star and now a life president of the KBA, said that it was the first time Kerala was conducting the State championship as a knockout event. “The league-cum-knockout format would have given us a better idea of the players but we don’t have much time. Also, it’s not easy to get funds now in this pandemic situation, so we can’t think of having a long championship,” said Sunny. “A long championship will be very expensive.”  We have the South Zone from November 25 in Coimbatore so we don’t have much time C.

02 November 2021||Milan,||Zlatan rolls back the years||Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored his 150th Serie A goal as AC Milan beat Jose Mourinho’s Roma 2-1 on Sunday to remain second on goal difference behind Napoli. The Sweden striker, who turned 40 earlier this month, also thought he had scored his 400th goal in domestic leagues but was denied a second of the encounter with VAR finding offside in the second half.  Milan was given a scare late on as Roma’s Nicolo Zaniolo had an 81st minute header blocked on the line before its former midfielder Stephan El Shaarawy claimed an additional time consolation effort. Earlier, Poland midfielder Piotr Zielinski scored as league leader Napoli overcame lowly Salernitana. Zielinski claimed his second goal of the season with half an hour left at the Arechi Stadium as both sides finished with 10 men. Real Sociedad returned to the top of La Liga on Sunday but its joy was tempered by having to share the points after an injury-time strike for Basque rival Athletic Bilbao in a 1-1 draw. Alexander Isak gave Sociedad a 58th-minute lead from the penalty spot. But just as it was contemplating opening a three-point advantage over Real Madrid and Sevilla at the top, Bilbao levelled in stoppage time thanks to an Iker Muniain free-kick which deceived Sociedad goalkeeper Alex Remiro.  The results: Premier League: Aston Villa 1 (Watkins 34) lost to West Ham 4 (Johnson 7, Rice 38, Fornals 80, Bowen 84).   LaLiga: Atletico Madrid 3 (Carrasco 26, Pezzella 63-og, Joao Felix 80) bt Real Betis 0; Getafe 2 (Unal 31, 56) bt Espanyol 1 (Gomez 38); Real Sociedad 1 (Isak 58-pen) drew with Athletic Bilbao 1 (Muniain 90+1).

02 November 2021||Barcelona,||Barca fighting to avoid early exit||Barcelona, fighting to stay relevant in the Champions League, is still without a replacement for fired manager Ronald Koeman going into its Group E match at Dynamo Kyiv. It will be without at least six important players including Gerard Pique, who has a right calf strain, and Sergio Aguero, who is expected to stay in a hospital to undergo further tests on his heart. Barca is third in the group, but group leader Bayern Munich suddenly has defensive issues to sort out before Benfica’s visit after conceding seven goals in its last two games. Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was busy in both games, putting the blame squarely on Bayern’s defenders. But there’s nothing wrong with the attack and Robert Lewandowski will be keen to add to his 17 goals from 14 games across all competitions this season as Bayern can book its place in the next round with a win against second-place Benfica. The immediate pressure eased on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer after leading Manchester United to a 3-0 victory at Tottenham in the Premier League on Saturday. The scrutiny about the manager’s future is sure to return if United can’t win at Atalanta on Tuesday, especially with a derby against Manchester City to follow on Saturday. United is at least top of Champions League Group F but with only six points from three games, one point more than Villarreal, which plays Young Boys.   Tuesday’s fixtures  Malmo vs Chelsea, Wolfsburg vs RB Salzburg (11:15 p.m.) Villarreal vs Young Boys, Juventus vs Zenit, Bayern vs Benfica, Sevilla vs Lille, Dynamo Kyiv vs Barcelona, Atalanta vs Man United (1.30 a.m. Wednesday)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/barca-fighting-to-avoid-early-exit/article37295802.ece
02 November 2021||November 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Shun self-praise||It is a natural human tendency to derive satisfaction from one’s achievements. But to boast about one’s abilities is a despicable trait, elaborated Malayaman in a discourse, citing examples from Tamil literature. A parent boasting about his children’s achievements is just as bad, for it is also in a way nothing but self-praise. But if others praise one’s child, then the parent secretly delights in this public recognition for her child. There can be no greater joy for a parent than to hear her child praised by others. When a mother hears people praising her son as a virtuous person, she is happier than she was when she gave birth to him, says Thiruvalluvar. Thiruvalluvar says that humility lifts a man to the status of a celestial. But pride leads him down a dark and evil path. Kumaraguruparar, in his Neethi Neri Vilakkam, says that if one keeps talking about how he has controlled his senses, and is not prone to temptation, then even his merits will turn to sins. A person truly deserving praise never speaks highly of himself. But a person who has no claim to fame is forever singing his own praises, says Thiruvalluvar. Bharatha Venba says that when a man praises himself, his acts of charity lose their merit. Needhi Nool says that self-praise is akin to a man who wants to clean himself through a bath, but rubs himself all over with mud. It is like pouring water over a flame when the intention is to make the lamp shine brightly, says Needhi Nool. A person who keeps talking about his talents, his attributes, his actions, and his achievements, will be mocked by everyone. He will lose everyone’s respect. Naaladiyaar says that he will be shunned. Pride is a disease, and one must conquer it before it becomes impossible to do so.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/shun-self-praise/article37295756.ece

02 November 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Punjab reduces power rates, Oppn. terms it ‘political stunt’||With an eye on the upcoming Assembly elections in the State, due early next year, the Punjab Cabinet on Monday decided to reduce power tariff for domestic consumers by Rs. 3 per unit. An official statement said that the annual financial burden on the State government would be approximately Rs. 3,316 crore due to the tariff rationalisation. The government will reduce the power procurement cost and it will be passed on to the consumers, it said. The decision, which was taken at a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi,would benefit 69 lakh domestic consumers across the State. The Cabinet also announced increase in the Dearness Allowance (DA) of government employees by 11%, from the existing 17% to 28%, effective from July 1, 2021. Mr. Channi told reporters that his government was committed to give the highest priority to the employees and their welfare. “With this decision, the State government would have to bear an additional monthly burden of Rs. 440 crore on account of enhanced DA. We have resolved most of employees’ issues to their satisfaction and hence they have called off their strike and resumed work with immediate effect,” he said, adding that the employees’ who were recruited after January 1, 2016, would also be given the benefit of minimum 15% increase in the revised pay at par with other employees. The Opposition was quick to hit out at the ruling Congress, accusing it of befooling the people of State. ‘Cong. hiked tariff’ Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Daljit Singh Cheema said Mr. Channi was resorting to an ‘election stunt’. “People should judge the Congress party by its past actions. The party had promised cheap power before ascending to power in 2017. However, during the last nearly five years it increased the power tariff by 35%,” said Mr. Cheema. BJP's Punjab State secretary Subhash Sharma termed the tariff decision as a ‘political stunt’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/punjab-reduces-power-rates-oppn-parties-term-it-political-stunt/article37296016.ece
02 November 2021||Mumbai,||Malik, Fadnavis war of words heats up||Kick-starting yet another controversy and taking former Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis head-on, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and State Minister Nawab Malik on Monday tweeted a photograph of alleged drug peddler Jaideep Rana with Mr. Fadnavis’ wife, Amruta, saying “Come, let’s talk about the relations between BJP and drug peddlers today”. In return, Mr. Fadnavis alleged that Mr. Malik had connections with the underworld. On Twitter Mr. Malik said, “I have released a photograph of a person named Jaideep Rana who is presently in Sabarmati jail. He has been arrested in a case of drug trafficking. He was the financial head of the song ‘River Anthem’ released by Amruta Fadnavis in which Devendra Fadnavis too was featured. The drug business grew under his tenure.” He also tweeted a screenshot of the description of the ‘River Anthem’, where Mr. Rana has been mentioned as the Finance Head. According to sources, the mention has been removed since the allegations. Replying to Mr. Malik, Mr. Fadnavis said, “I will be exposing his underworld connections post-Deepavali and will give all the evidence to NCP president Sharad Pawar.” Those who live in glass house should not throw stones at others, he added. ‘Pressurising NCB’ “He is doing all this to pressurise the NCB, which is probing the drug case against his son-in-law. The said photograph is an old one, taken during the shooting of the song and the company which made the video has clarified that they had hired his services for the song. The person under question has no relation whatsoever with me or my wife,” Mr. Fadnavis said. He added that Mr. Malik has lit a sparkler before Deepavali, and he would burst a bomb post-Deepavali. In his reply, Mr. Malik tweeted in Hindi. “ Hai taiyar hum [We are ready]”. Earlier, Mr. Malik mentioned Neeraj Gunde, one of close aides of Mr. Fadnavis during the latter’s tenure as chief minister, demanding a CBI probe. “Neeraj Gunde used to frequent the CMO, from where he used to handle police transfers. Even Sameer Wankhede was brought in by Fadnavis who is controlling drug operations. The Centre must conduct a judicial probe and even a CBI investigation,” he said. The NCP leader alleged that the BJP had been posting officers in Central services to target Bollywood and Maharashtra. Baseless charges: Patil Meanwhile, the BJP’s Maharashtra unit president Chandrakant Patil said Mr. Malik should not make “baseless allegations” against the former chief minister. “Apparently the ruling MVA Government has nothing to say on serious issues facing Maharashtra such as distressed farmers, rising atrocities against women and the agitations of desperate State transport department drivers. Twenty-nine drivers have committed suicide thus far, but the State Government has no answer. So, this Government asks somebody [Mr. Malik] to raise some issues to divert the public’s attention,” Mr. Patil said. Exhorting the NCP leader to stop his “baseless allegations”, Mr. Patil said Mr. Fadnavis had always shown “remarkable restraint” while directing any criticism towards a ruling party leader and had certainly never commented on anyone’s wife or family. Mr. Patil also claimed that Neeraj Gunde, whom Mr. Malik accused of having shadowy connections, was in fact a “clean and good social worker”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/malik-fadnavis-war-of-words-heats-up/article37296030.ece
02 November 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Orissa High Court nod for sale and use of green firecrackers||The Orissa High Court on Monday granted permission for sale and use of only green crackers that are approved by the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO). The All Odisha Fireworks Dealers Association had moved the High Court seeking permission for sale of green crackers for Deepavali. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice S. Muralidhar and Justice B. P. Routray said the sale and use of fireworks should be limited to only green fireworks that conform to the definition and formulation as proposed by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, a CSIR institute. The authenticated copy of the PESO certificate granted after due inspection of existing stocks lying in possession of the traders or dealers should be deposited with the district administration or the police commissioner for getting permission to sell green fireworks, the court said. ‘Mere label won’t do’ “Traders or dealers who fail to obtain and produce the certificate from the PESO would not be allowed to sell their products. Mere label of fireworks boxes as green fireworks and providing QR codes would not entitle any trader or dealer to sell the crackers,” the Bench said. The court also directed that fireworks should be burst only from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. on November 4. It warned of strict penal action if the norm is violated. “Only green fireworks should be sold at designated sites and all COVID-19 protocols should be strictly followed. Sale of fireworks on the Internet should be strictly banned. Moreover, wholesale traders and retailers should have to produce original invoices on demand by the district administration,” it said Violation of any of the aforesaid conditions would be dealt with strictly and penal action would be taken as per law, the Bench said. Prohibitory orders Meanwhile, district administrations across the State have imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 at different places of worship to dissuade devotees from congregating in public places on Deepavali.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/orissa-high-court-nod-for-sale-and-use-of-green-firecrackers/article37296221.ece
02 November 2021||Patna,||Bihar Congress launches mega membership drive||The Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) on Monday launched a mega membership drive in the State apparently to regain its lost ground among voters. Earlier, the State in-charge of the party Bhakt Charan Das had announced that Congress party would contest the upcoming 2024 Parliamentary elections in Bihar on its own. “The mega membership drive is likely to continue till 31 March 2022. We’re now moving towards our commitment to contest the upcoming Lok Sabha poll in 2024 on our own”, Congress Legislature Party leader (CLP) Ajit Sharma said. During our mega membership drive, added Mr. Sharma, “the party will make connection with our old party cadres and voters and will also raise issues of price hike, unemployment and corruption in the State”. Earlier in 2020, BPCC had launched a digital membership drive which, party leaders said, “was not very successful as there were some technical issues not addressed properly”. The State party president Madan Mohan Jha flagged off the mega membership drive at Sadquat Ashram, State party headquarters. Other senior State party leaders like Prem Chandra Mishra, Chandan Bagchi, Kaukab Quadri, Brajesh Kumar Munnan, Rajesh Rathore too were present on the occasion. “The party has set the target of making 80 lakh people to be members of the party during the drive. The membership form has 10 guidelines for the new members to follow”, said State party leader and spokesperson Asit Nath Tiwari. Recently, ahead of the bypoll on two seats in Bihar, Tarapur and Kusheshwarsthan State party in-charge Mr. Das had declared to snap ties with the alliance partner Rashtriya Janata Dal in Bihar. The Congress party, later, also fielded candidates on two seats against RJD and JD(U) nominees. Claim refuted However, RJD president Lalu Prasad kept reiterating that alliance with Congress party was still intact as he had spoken to Congress president Sonia Gandhi. But, State Congress leaders strongly refuted Mr. Prasad’s claim and said there was “no talk between Ms. Gandhi and Mr. Prasad”. Earlier in 2000, 2005, 2009 and 2010 too both the parties had parted ways and contested poll separately. “Our electoral dependence on RJD has made us weakened, but this time we’ll do our best to rejuvenate our party workers and voters to gear up for the 2024 Parliamentary poll”, said a senior State party leader.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bihar-congress-launches-mega-membership-drive/article37296027.ece

But the entire society is behind Wankhede,” said Mr. Patil. He also dared the MVA leadership and Mr. Malik to investigate those against whom they had been making allegations. Mr. Patil said Maharashtra had been ravaged by heavy rain and floods, but no compensation for farmers had been given. “In the Marathwada region alone, 38 lakh hectares were ravaged while 11 lakh hectares of agricultural land was eroded. Farmers have not yet received any compensation nor any crop insurance despite the announcement of a Rs. 10,000-crore package.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/nawab-malik-should-not-make-baseless-allegations-bjp-leader/article37296228.ece
