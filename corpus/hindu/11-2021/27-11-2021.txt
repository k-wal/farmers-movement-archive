27 November 2021||Geneva,||Omicron new variant of concern||The World Health Organization (WHO) on Friday classified the B.1.1.529 variant detected in South Africa as a SARS-CoV-2 “variant of concern”, saying it may spread more quickly than other forms. Preliminary evidence suggested that there is an increased risk of reinfection and there had been a “detrimental change in COVID-19 epidemiology”, the WHO said after a meeting of experts who reviewed the data. Infections in South Africa had risen steeply in recent weeks, coinciding with the detection of the variant now designated as omicron, the WHO said. “This variant has been detected at faster rates than previous surges in infection, suggesting that this variant may have a growth advantage,” the WHO said. Current PCR tests continue to successfully detect the variant, it said. Earlier, the WHO cautioned countries against hastily imposing travel restrictions linked to the Omicron variant, saying they should take a “risk-based and scientific approach”. While medical experts warned against any overreaction before the variant was better understood, nations raced to halt air travel, markets fell sharply and scientists held emergency meetings to weigh the exact risks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/new-variant-who-not-for-travel-curbs/article37714585.ece
27 November 2021||MANGALURU,||Govt. suspends Leprosy Officer on sexual harassment charge||The State Government has suspended Dakshina Kannada District Leprosy Officer Rathnakar on the charge of sexually harassing a woman contract employee working in his office. However, the Karnataka State Administrative Tribunal, headed by its chairman Justice R.B. Budihal, has stayed the order of suspension. Following the receipt of information of the alleged sexual harassment, Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra directed District Health and Family Welfare Officer M. Kishor Kumar to conduct an inquiry. The Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) of the department, which is constituted under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, carried out a probe and submitted its report to the Deputy Commissioner on August 28. Following the receipt of the report, the Principal Secretary, Department of Health and Family Welfare, on November 8 passed an order keeping Dr. Rathnakar under suspension and placed him in lien against the vacant post of Medical Officer of Community Health Centre, Gurmitkal, Yadgir district, pending outcome of the disciplinary action. Dr. Rathnakar filed a writ petition in the High Court of Karnataka questioning the report of the committee. He contended that in the absence of a written complaint, the committee had no jurisdiction to initiate an inqury. He said that a message received by the Deputy Commissioner on WhatsApp has been treated as a complaint by the committee. Justice S.G. Pandit of the High Court stayed the report on November 18 for eight weeks. Dr. Rathnakar placed the order of the High Court before the Karnataka State Administrative Tribunal. On November 24, Mr. Budihal stayed the order of suspension till further notice and posted the matter for further hearing on December 2. The alleged sexual harassment came to light after videos and photographs of Dr. Rathnakar’s conduct with the woman employee went viral on social media on November 25. Meanwhile, Shweta, a member of Durga Vahini, on Friday filed a complaint with the Woman Police seeking action against Dr. Ratnakar. The Woman Police registered it for an offence under Section 354 of Indian Penal Code. Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar said that the police have taken custody of Dr. Rathankar and are questioning him. A statement of the harassed employee will be taken shortly, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-suspends-leprosy-officer-on-sexual-harassment-charge/article37715102.ece
27 November 2021||MANGALURU,||Three caught in rip current, die||Three government pre-university college students were drowned in a rivulet near Shivapura in Udupi district on Friday. The police gave the names of the deceased as Sudershan, Kiran and Sonith, all students of Government Pre University College, Hiriyadka.

27 November 2021||MANGALURU,||Karandlaje urges Rly. Minister to open PRS counter at Kundapur station||Union Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare and Udupi-Chikkamagaluru MP Shobha Karandlaje has urged the Railway Ministry to open a passenger reservation system (PRS) counter at the railway station in Kundapur which falls in her Lok Sabha constituency. In her letter to Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, Ms. Karandlaje said, “Considering the problems of Indian Post Kundapur PRS and religious, tourist commuters demand, I propose to shift PRS Centre from post office to the railway station in Kundapura or start new PRS at the railway station building.” Rail patrons have been facing difficulties in buying advance reservation tickets as the India Post PRS remained non-functional for over six months due to technical glitches. Ms. Karandlaje said that passengers from the Kundapur region as well as tourists were not happy with services at India Post PRS since its opening in 2013. The PRS was not operational on Sundays and public holidays and passengers always faced difficulty in booking Tatkal tickets. Services were affected during morning peak hours as postal employees were busy doing their routine, she said and added that the postal PRS regularly faced technical glitches while it was non-functional for the last six months. It would have been easy for passengers to book advance tickets if PRS was located at the station building itself, while the postal PRS was 8 km away from the station, she said. Halt sought In another letter to Mr. Vaishnaw, Ms. Karandlaje has urged the Ministry to provide a halt for Train Nos. 22113/22114 Mumbai LTT-Kochuveli-Mumbai LTT bi-weekly Superfast Express at Kundapur. The Minister said that she had earlier conveyed her demand to Minister of State for Railways Darshana Vikram Jardosh and sent a copy to Konkan Railway Corporation too. KRCL had forwarded the letter to the Railway Board, she said and added that providing a halt for these services will not affect the running of the trains. The proposal is awaiting the Minister’s approval, she said. Providing a halt for these services will help hundreds of passengers as well as tourists as Kundapur is connected to many places of tourist importance, Ms. Karandlaje said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/karandlaje-urges-rly-minister-to-open-prs-counter-at-kundapur-station/article37715100.ece

27 November 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi air turns toxic again||Delhi’s air quality deteriorated to the “severe” category on Friday but is expected to slightly improve to the higher end of the “very poor” category over the next two days. The Air Quality Index (AQI) of the Capital was 406 on Friday, up from 400 on Thursday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) 4 p.m. bulletin, which is the average of the past 24 hours. An AQI between 301 and 400 is considered “very poor” and between 401 and 500 “severe”. The current spike in pollution is chiefly due to a drop in wind speed and a fall in the height up to which pollutants can be distributed in the atmosphere. Local surface winds are likely to increase slightly in the next two days and increase dispersion of pollutants leading to slight improvement, but the AQI is expected to remain in the “very poor” band, according to a statement issued by the Government-run monitoring agency SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research). A significant improvement in AQI is expected from Monday due to high wind speed. On Friday, the contribution of stubble burning in neighbouring States to PM2.5 (a chief pollutant) in Delhi was only 8%, according to SAFAR. Severe air pollution levels affect healthy people and “seriously impacts” those with existing diseases, according to the CPCB. Doctors in many hospitals said they witnessed a rise in the number of patients coming to hospitals with respiratory problems this year since the spike in pollution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/delhi-air-turns-toxic-again/article37714791.ece
27 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Family-based political parties threat to democracy, says PM||At two separate events to mark “Constitution Day” Prime Minister Narendra Modi flagged dynastic politics as a threat to constitutional democracy and flayed certain Indians with a “colonial mindset” for erecting barriers to development in the country by “misusing” freedoms enshrined in the Constitution. Addressing Parliament first on the occasion of “Constitution Day”, Mr. Modi said the day was for paying homage to the House, but that India was heading for a “crisis” in the form of family-based parties, in an obvious dig at Opposition parties, many of whom had boycotted the event. While speaking on the Constitution he said it was “not just a collection of many articles; our Constitution is a great tradition of millenia. This is a modern expression of that unbroken stream.” Prime Minister Modi in his address paid tributes to Constitution framer B.R. Ambedkar and also homage on the 13th anniversary of the November 26 terror attacks in Mumbai.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/family-based-parties-a-threat-to-democracy-pm/article37714383.ece
27 November 2021||Bengaluru,||SSLC syllabus will be cut by 20%: Minister||The State Government has decided to truncate the SSLC syllabus by 20% this year. Primary and Secondary Education Minister B.C. Nagesh told The Hindu that an order in this regard would be issued after the Department of State Educational Research and Training decides which portion of the syllabus could be pruned. Mr. Nagesh said the decision was taken after officials took stock of the situation by visiting districts and reviewing academicactivities of SSLC students. “The pandemic has had a cascading effect on completion of the syllabus. The next academic year has to be started on time. We will also come out with a notification on the commencement of the next academic year,” said the Minister. Syllabus cuts are likely to be made applicable to all the subjects. Last academic year, Class IX students were promoted to Class X without appearing for examination. “They will be facing exam after almost three years. Cutting the syllabus by 20% will help them,” Mr. Nagesh said. Students, teachers, and school managements have welcomed the decision as they were strugglingto complete the portion in time. While physical classes have resumed, teachers have been devoting time revising concepts taught in previous years to bridge learning gaps. “We had requested the government two or three times to reduce the burden on students by pruning the syllabus. Trimming the syllabus will enable students to get quality learning in the available academic hours,” said D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary, Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sslc-syllabus-will-be-cut-by-20-minister/article37714615.ece
27 November 2021||PALAKKAD,||Govt. orders investigation into Attappady infant deaths||The State Government has ordered an investigation into the circumstances that led to the deaths of three infants on successive days in Attappady. Sickle cell anaemia was found to have caused the infant deaths in Agali and Pudur grama panchayats of Attappady. Minister for Welfare of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Backward Classes K. Radhakrishnan has sought a report from Scheduled Tribe Development Department Director T.V. Anupama. Mr. Radhakrishnan will visit Attappady on Saturday to evaluate the situation. He will convene a meeting at Agali in the morning. Health Minister Veena George too has asked the Health Department Director to conduct an investigation into the deaths of children in Attappady. Latest incident The latest death was that of a 10-month-old girl at Kathirambathiyur in Agali panchayat. Asanya, daughter of Ramya and Ayyappan, died while being brought to Government Tribal Specialty Hospital at Kottathara. Hospital sources said that the girl was under treatment for heart ailment. A three-day-old infant from Attappady died on Thursday at Government Taluk Hospital, Mannarkkad. Figures indicate that 10 infants died in Attappady in the current year. A young fully pregnant woman and her unborn child too died in Attappady on Tuesday because of sickle cell anaemia. Thulasi Balakrishnan, 23, from Thavalam, died at Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Thrissur.

27 November 2021||Hyderabad,||A grim reminder of Disha rape and murder||At 6.10 p.m., the reddish orange sky turns into a navy blue as the last vestiges of daylight disappear at the Outer Ring Road’s exit number 16. Known as Tondupally exit, it was at this busy traffic junction that the veterinary doctor parked her scooter on the fateful day of November 27, 2019. Within hours, criminals set in motion a plot to rape and kill a young woman that horrified Hyderabad and the world as the details emerged. “We no longer go singly to that location. Someone has to accompany or we go in a group,” says Archana who runs a kirana yards away from the place where the barbaric crime took place. Brightly lit by dozens of LEDs and high mast lamps, the never-ending stream of vehicles and the fine dust turn the location into a haze. “She parked the vehicle there. People coming from Shamshabad and Rallaguda park their vehicles and catch vehicles to go to Gachibowli,” says Nikhil, a resident of Tondupally. While some residents said they were scared of the location, life appears to go on normally as schoolchildren alight from Telangana State Road Transport Corporation buses and go home. Workers from the nearby construction sites converge near the ORR exit to hitchhike a ride home. Then, there are parked lorries with the drivers and cleaners loitering, waiting for directions or pick up necessities. “We cannot stop our lives. I sell vegetables for living, I cannot do anything else. This is a brightly lit area. What happened on that night was very unfortunate. But I cannot say I am not worried,” says a vegetable vendor near the village temple. While that dark night of November might disappear from public memory, for the village of Tondupally the ORR junction will remain a grim reminder of man’s capacity for evil.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/a-grim-reminder-of-disha-rape-and-murder-incident/article37714928.ece
27 November 2021||KARIMNAGAR,||Three brothers among 4 killed in Karimnagar road accident||Four persons, including three brothers — an executive engineer, an advocate and an architect — were killed and another person grievously injured when the car in which they were travelling rammed into a tree on the Huzurabad-Karimnagar highway near Manakondur in the early hours of Friday. The incident occurred around 4.30 a.m. when the driver of the car lost control of the vehicle amid poor visibility due to fog and crashed it into a roadside tree in the early hours of the day, sources said. The deceased were identified as 57-year-old Executive Engineer in Panchayat Raj Department at Sircilla Koppula Srinivasa Rao, his two brothers — 55-year-old advocate Sridhar and 53-year-old architect Sriraju — besides 26-year-old resident of Karimnagar Jalandhar. Another occupant of the car sustained serious injuries in the accident. He was admitted to a hospital in Karimnagar. Tenth day ceremony The trio met with a tragic end while returning to Karimnagar from Kallur in Khammam district after attending the 10th day ceremony (post-death ritual) at their relative’s house, sources added. Police suspect that the driver of the car dozed off at the wheel and rammed the tree on the extreme right side of the highway leading to the ghastly accident. Though the car’s airbags opened but that could not save the lives of four occupants of the ill-fated vehicle in the pre-dawn car accident that left only one survivor with injuries. Manakondur police are investigating the case to determine the exact cause of the horrific car crash.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/3-brothers-among-four-killed-in-road-accident/article37714939.ece
27 November 2021||CHENNAI,||‘Certain irregularities and procedural lapses occurred at Anna varsity under Surappa’||The Tamil Nadu Government on Friday informed the Madras High Court that it had received a report from a Commission of Inquiry, constituted during the AIADMK government, to probe the charges of corruption, malpractice, financial irregularities and irregularities in appointments at Anna University when M.K. Surappa was the Vice-Chancellor. Appearing before Justice V. Parthiban, Advocate-General R. Shunmugasundaram said the commission, headed by the retired High Court judge, P. Kalaiyarasan, had completed its probe and submitted a report. “Certain irregularities and procedural lapses have been found by the commission on the basis of evidence placed before it, and now the government has to act on it,” he said. The submissions were made at the hearing of a petition filed by Mr. Surappa in February this year to quash a Government Order of November 11, 2020, constituting the commission. Subsequently, he demitted office on April 11 this year on completion of his three-year tenure, but the commission continued its inquiry. When the matter came up on Friday, Mr. Shunmugasundaram said the case had become infructuous since the commission had wound up its proceedings and submitted a report. Now, it was for the government to take the proceedings forward. However, it was argued on behalf of Mr. Surappa that the very initiation of the inquiry was wrong and that the court must decide its validity. When the former Vice-Chancellor’s academic and other credentials were highlighted to underscore that he had enjoyed an impeccable track record, the Advocate-General intervened to state: “Let us not glorify him. There is a finding given by a former judge of this court and those findings are based on evidence.” After hearing both sides and finding that the Government was not inclined to drop the proceedings and instead wanted to take the inquiry to its logical conclusion, the judge directed the Government to produce a copy of the report and file a detailed counter-affidavit by December 15. In his affidavit, Mr. Surappa had said he undertook major development work after assuming charge in April 2018. However, his opposition to the then government’s decision to pass all engineering students without conducting examinations for the “arrears” papers on account of COVID-19 and his efforts to obtain the Institute of Eminence (IoE) status to the university had triggered a controversy. He claimed to have taken steps for obtaining the IoE status in June 2020 because it would bring the university a grant of Rs. 1,000 crore over five years, and that money could be spent on research. Also, the status would give more autonomy to the university and the freedom to determine fees, course structure and governance. The IoE status could have been obtained with a condition that the university continue to follow the State Government’s 69% reservation policy in admission and not the Union Government’s policy which capped the quota at 49.5%. Nevertheless, the move triggered a huge row since reservation was an important subject of electoral politics and because the Government did not want its control over the university to be reduced, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/certain-irregularities-and-procedural-lapses-occurred-at-anna-varsity-under-surappa/article37714657.ece
27 November 2021||Kolkata,||Show that celebrated 200 years of Bengal art to shut down||Ghare Baire, the popular museum-exhibition in Kolkata that showcased two centuries of art in Bengal and was housed in a building almost as old, is shutting down on Sunday after enriching the cultural landscape of the city for nearly two years. The announcement was sudden, with DAG Museums, a private entity that ran the show in collaboration with the National Gallery of Modern Art and the Archaeological Survey of India (both under the Culture Ministry), issuing a statement on Friday that they would be downing the shutters of Ghare Baire on November 28. According to sources, DAG Museums’ contract with the Ministry for Ghare Baire came to an end sometime last year and the Ministry had now decided not to renew it. Short-lived existence The museum-exhibition was inaugurated on January 11, 2020 at the renovated Currency Building — which was built in 1833 and almost razed in 1996 — located in BBD Bagh, also known as Dalhousie Square. It was shut down temporarily a few times due to the pandemic. “Consisting of multiple exhibitions, Ghare Baire traced the evolution of art in Bengal from the arrival of travelling European artists to the establishment of one of the earliest colonial art schools, the rise of indigenous practices, a revivalist movement borne of resistance to imperial impositions as well as the high tide of modernism. Viewed through a historical lens, the curation included the largest such collection of Bengal art on public display anywhere in the world,” the DAG statement said. ‘Dynamic cultural space’ “Ghare Baire combined sensitive displays with extensive notes in English and Bengali on artists, art movements and individual artworks spanning the gamut of early European aquatints, Kalighat and Early Bengal paintings, prints, drawings, paintings in watercolour, oil and acrylic, photography as well as sculpture. Its galleries and courtyard were used for workshops and as performance spaces, creating a dynamic cultural space in the city. With Ghare Baire set to close in Kolkata on Sunday, we promise to return with newer perspectives and exhibitions — our way of thanking the city that deserves the epithet of ‘art capital’ of India,” the statement said. Ghare Baire (at home and the world) derived its name from the title of Rabindranath Tagore’s iconic novel, which later inspired Satyajit Ray to make a film by the same name.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/show-that-celebrated-200-years-of-bengal-art-to-shut-down/article37714796.ece
27 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||CBI gets sanction to prosecute HC ex-judge||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has received sanction to prosecute retired judge of the Allahabad High Court, S.N. Shukla, in connection with a case for allegedly favouring a private medical college in his orders. The agency had sought the High Court’s approval to prosecute the retired judge earlier this year. Following the grant of sanction, it can now file a chargesheet for further legal proceedings. Besides Justice Shukla, who was with the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court, retired judge of the Orissa High Court I.M. Quddusi has also been named in the First Information Report. The other accused are Bhawana Pandey of Prasad Education Trust; Bhagwan Prasad Yadav, chairman of the Prasad Institute of Medical Sciences; his son Palash; and Sudhir Giri of Venketashwara Medical College (Meerut). The case was registered in December 2019 on the basis of a preliminary enquiry initiated by the CBI on September 8, 2017, into the alleged commission of gross misconduct by Justice Shukla and others. The Medical Council of India (MCI) had barred the Prasad Institute of Medical Sciences in May 2017 from admitting students for two years due to substandard facilities and non-fulfilment of criteria. Similar action had been taken against 46 other medical institutions. The Trust challenged the order in the Supreme Court. Subsequently, it is alleged, a conspiracy was hatched and the petition withdrawn with the court’s permission. Then, another petition was filed before a Division Bench of the Allahabad HC in Lucknow on August 24, 2017. The next day, Mr. Quddusi and the institute’s chairman met Justice Shukla at his residence and “delivered illegal gratification”. According to the CBI, the petition was heard later that day by the Division Bench comprising Justice Shukla and a favourable order was passed. The MCI challenged the order in the Supreme Court. During the hearing, the Trust did not claim any benefit from the High Court order, but requested that its bank guarantee not be encashed, which was permitted. The agency alleged that the institute’s chief then attempted to get back the illegal gratification from Justice Shukla and a part of it was returned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cbi-gets-sanction-to-prosecute-hc-ex-judge/article37714611.ece

27 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||SKM leaders to meet today on next move||As they mark one year of protests on Delhi’s borders, farm unions are united in celebrating the Government’s concession to their demand to repeal the three farm reform laws. However, leaders from different States and political philosophies have varying ideas on the next steps forward and what it would take to satisfy their demand for a legal guarantee of minimum support prices (MSP) for their crops. A meeting of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM)’s core committee will be held on Saturday to determine the future course of action. The three protest sites surrounding Delhi at Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur were thronged with farmers determined to flaunt their “historic victory” in convincing the Government to accede to their headline demand. “It is a monumental achievement that after 12 months, the farmers have forced this obstinate Prime Minister to blink, and to bend down. Few other struggles can claim such a victory,” said All India Kisan Sabha general secretary Hannan Mollah. Many farmers and leaders from Punjab, especially those without political affiliations outside the State, seem hopeful that the victory means they can go home after the year-long agitation. “We have won. The baseline has been crossed. We will now wait to see that Parliament actually repeals the laws and that the committee [mentioned by the PM] has a strong farmers’ voice,” said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary of the Dhakaunda faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). “We want to safeguard MSP also. But for many farmers in Punjab and Haryana, who are already getting MSP through government procurement, it was the repeal of the three laws that was the most critical factor and they feel the struggle is over,” said another Punjab leader who did not wish to be named. In Uttar Pradesh, on the other hand, the majority of farmers are yet to benefit from government procurement at MSP rates and a legal guarantee would have more significance for them. Electoral calculations will also play a role in the decision of how to take the protests forward. “The MSP must be recognised as the right of all farmers, not just a few. We will continue to fight until all farmers get their due,” said Rakesh Tikait, who heads a western U.P. faction of the BKU.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/skm-leaders-to-meet-today-on-next-move/article37714617.ece

27 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||International flights from December 15||India will resume international flights to all countries from December 15, after a gap of 20 months, though there will be restrictions on the number of flights permitted from a country depending on its health risk status. Key destinations for Indians such as U.S., Canada, Australia, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and Sri Lanka are permitted to have 100% of pre-COVID capacity. Europe and countries like Singapore will be allowed 75% of pre-COVID flights, while China and Hong Kong will be allowed 50% of pre-COVID flights. India has air-service pacts with at least 109 countries. The decision, however, comes even as several countries are tightening travel restrictions after a new coronavirus variant has been identified in South Africa. Fares likely to drop The announcement is likely to result in a fall in airfares on key routes, as well as allow travellers to take via flights, which was banned under the air bubble arrangements India signed with 31 countries as an interim measure. “Due to prevailing COVID-19 situation, the capacity entitlements shall be as per the category of countries based on enlistment of countries as at-risk from time to time by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare,” the Ministry of Civil Aviation said in an order issued on Friday. It further added that countries outside the “at-risk” list will be allowed 100% of pre-COVID flights. Countries in the “at-risk” list, but with whom India has an air-bubble will be allowed 75% of pre-COVID flights, while those with which India doesn’t have air-bubbles will be allowed 50% of pre-pandemic flights. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on Friday identified 11 countries as well as all of Europe as “at risk”. These 11 countries are South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong, Israel. “In a market that is bursting with pent-up demand for international travel, and a tourism industry that has been starved of revenue, the opening up of our international travel routes is exactly the timely intervention that was required to give a boost to the millions of Indians who are dependent on this sector for their livelihood,” said Subhash Goyal, chairman STIC Travels.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/come-dec-15-india-will-resume-scheduled-international-flights/article37714587.ece

Ramana said on Friday that the nation should evolve and progress through the framework of debate provided in the Constitution. “The most important feature of the Indian Constitution is the fact that it provides a framework for debate. It is through such debate and discussion that the nation ultimately progresses, evolves, and achieves higher levels of welfare for the people,” Chief Justice Ramana said in his address on Constitution Day. The CJI said the Constitution of today, built upon the foundations laid by the framers, was a richer and more complex document than it was when it was adopted in 1949. “This is a result of the dialogue that took place both inside and outside the courtroom, resulting in novel and unique interpretations,” Chief Justice Ramana said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/nation-should-evolve-through-debate-cji/article37714382.ece
27 November 2021||KOCHI,||HC cracks whip on headload workers at Sabarimala||Headload workers cannot claim the legal right to load and unload the goods that are brought to Sabarimala, Pampa and Nilackal, the Kerala High Court has clarified. Only those workers engaged by the Travancore Devaswom Board and its contractors have the right to engage in the loading and unloading of goods. The police should take stern action against those who obstruct the work, a Division Bench of the court consisting of Justice Anil K. Narendran and Justice P.G. Ajithkumar directed on Friday. The High Court intervention came after Sabarimala Special Commissioner M. Manoj Kumar reporting that headload workers were obstructing the transporting of goods brought for the temple needs. The court had earlier clarified that the temple premises do not come under the purview of the Kerala Headload Workers Act. Goods are brought to the Sannidhanam in trucks by the workers engaged by the board.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-cracks-whip-on-headload-workers-at-sabarimala/article37714945.ece
27 November 2021||KOCHI,||Driver of tailing car arrested in models’ death case||The Crime Branch probing the alleged mystery behind the accident at Chakkaraparambu here that claimed three lives, including two promising models, arrested one more person on Friday. The arrested is Syju Thankachan, who was found following the ill-fated car of the victims. He was booked under Sections 354-D (stalking) and 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) read with 109 (Abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence). His arrest was recorded late on Friday evening after hours-long interrogation. He was summoned for interrogation previously after he was caught in the CCTV footage and had since moved the court for anticipatory bail. He had then claimed that he had followed the victims and asked them not to drive under the influence of alcohol. He was untraceable thereafter till Friday. However, investigation sources said that the CCTV footage along the route leading to the accident site clearly showed a definite acceleration by the victims’ car after the encounter with the accused. A calculation of the speed of the car using CCTV footage indicated the sudden acceleration after the encounter, which is suspected to have also contributed to the accident. He is also accused of stalking the women by allegedly asking them repeatedly to stay back after the party, which they had attended, despite their summary rejection. Sources said that the driver had corroborated the police finding that Syju’s approach allegedly with sexual intent, had instilled fear in the two young women. The police have also reportedly obtained evidence of the man waiting outside the hotel before the victims left the place. He then allegedly followed them, and at one point, rolled down the window glass and asked them to stay back, which they declined. The victims probably feared that he would waylay them or follow them to their houses, said an officer. Meanwhile, the police have not yet managed to recover the hard disk of the CCTV digital video recorder (DVR) of the hotel that was allegedly dumped into the backwaters. The police have called off the search after three days of search with the help of experts. The hard disk is believed to contain crucial footage from the hotel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/driver-of-tailing-car-held-in-models-death-case/article37714948.ece
27 November 2021||MYSURU,||Woman, friend humiliated in Nanjangud||A woman and her male friend were tied to a pole and subjected to public humiliation at Hemmargala village in Nanjangud taluk before they were rescued by the police on Friday. The Nanjangud police, who confirmed the incident, said the victim had blamed her estranged husband Ravi and her brother-in-law Chandru. The woman and her friend were tied to a pole on Thursday evening pending a panchayat meeting to “dispense justice” when the police received information and rescued the victims. The woman was wailing and pleading with the public to untie her. Though a formal complaint is yet to be registered, the police have taken Ravi and Chandru into custody and are questioning them. The police said preliminary inquiry indicated that Ravi suspected that his wife was in a relationship with another male and hence tied them to a pole in public. It is suspected that the woman and her friend were denied food and water overnight besides being assaulted by the public. However, the police are yet to confirm it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/woman-friend-humiliated-in-nanjangud-village/article37714632.ece

27 November 2021||New Delhi,||MPs are defenders of dignity of Parliament, says President||President Ram Nath Kovind said on Friday that Members of Parliament (MPs), whether they represent the ruling party or the Opposition, are defenders of the dignity of Parliament and one should not confuse competition to be rivalry. Amid a boycott by around 15 Opposition parties, President Kovind addressed MPs in the Central Hall of the Parliament on the occasion of Constitution Day to commemorate the day the Indian Constitution was adopted. President Kovind said there may be differences of opinion, but no difference should be so great as to hinder the real purpose of public service. “The Opposition is, in fact, the most important element of democracy,” he noted. “Without an effective Opposition, democracy becomes ineffective. It is expected that the Government and the Opposition, despite their differences, continue to work together in the best interests of the citizens..” Noting that it was natural for members of the ruling party and the Opposition to compete, he said it should be “about being better representatives and doing better things for the public good. Only then will it be considered healthy competition”. “We all believe that our Parliament is a ‘Temple of Democracy’. Therefore, it becomes the responsibility of every parliamentarian to conduct themselves in this temple of democracy with the same spirit of reverence with which they do in their places of worship,” President Kovind said. President Kovind also released the digital version of the Constituent Assembly debates, as well as the calligraphed version of the Constitution, at the event. Speaking at the function, Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu, who is the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, said legislatures should be guided by “dialogue and debate” and not be rendered “dysfunctional through persistent disruptions”. Mr. Naidu argued that the people’s will in a democracy is conveyed as the mandate to the Governments of the day, and stressed that “tolerance towards the mandate of the people should be the guiding spirit for the legislatures”. The Rajya Sabha Chairman said productivity of the House, that was meant to be one for Elders, had hit the lowest ever productivity of 29.60% during the last session, slipping from the previous low of 35.75% during 2018. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, in his address, too spoke about Parliament being a forum for debate instead of disruptions. While interacting with journalists after the function, he stated his displeasure at the boycott by the Opposition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mps-are-defenders-of-dignity-of-parliament-says-president/article37714308.ece
27 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Over 50% of Bihar population multidimensionally poor: NITI||With more than 50% of the population in Bihar identified as “multidimensionally poor”, the State has the maximum percentage of population living in poverty among all the States and the Union Territories, according to Government think tank NITI Aayog’s Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI). As per the index, 51.91% of the population in Bihar is poor, followed by Jharkhand (42.16%), Uttar Pradesh (37.79%), Madhya Pradesh (36.65%) and Meghalaya (32.67%). On the other hand, Kerala registered the lowest population poverty levels (0.71%), followed by Puducherry (1.72%), Lakshadweep (1.82%), Goa (3.76%) and Sikkim (3.82%). Other States and Union Territories where less than 10% of the population is poor include Tamil Nadu (4.89%), Andaman & Nicobar Islands (4.30%), Delhi (4.79%), Punjab (5.59%), Himachal Pradesh (7.62%) and Mizoram (9.8%). “The development of the National Multidimensional Poverty Index of India is an important contribution towards instituting a public policy tool which monitors multidimensional poverty, informs evidence-based and focused interventions, thereby ensuring that no one is left behind,” NITI Aayog Chairman Rajeev Kumar said in the foreword. He said India’s national MPI measure uses the globally accepted and robust methodology developed by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). “Importantly, as a measure of multidimensional poverty, it captures multiple and simultaneous deprivation faced by households.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/over-50-of-bihar-population-multidimensionally-poor-niti/article37714330.ece
27 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||New waves of virus anticipated: experts||With a new coronavirus variant detected in South Africa, scientists and health experts in India have said new waves of the infection are anticipated and unless we act quickly and efficiently, the country will possibly see repeat waves. India had better tools in hand now compared to two years ago, said Vinod Scaria, scientist at CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB). He added that the country, however, had to improve its vaccination drive, public health measures, health infrastructure and genomic surveillance to be better prepared. Time was valuable and we could not afford to lose it, he said, adding that India had the best tools at hand, vaccines and public health measures, including masks, distancing and ventilation. Unfortunately, there was a global inequity of vaccines. “We have to use our precious time to vaccinate all eligible people with two doses at least. Closing the gap in the unvaccinated and second dose in the 45+ age group could provide a unique opportunity to minimise COVID-19 deaths,” he said. Dr. Scaria said boosters would not help when a larger proportion of the world had not even received one dose. According to experts, the new variant from South Africa was important as it had a large number of mutations, including around 32 in spike protein, some of which were independently associated with immune escape as well as increased transmissibility. While the additive behaviours of such mutations could not be accurately predicted, this could give rise to directions to focused investigation, they added. Stating that the latest development was particularly concerning for a densely populated country such as India, Dr. Scaria said transmission among the susceptible population could occur at a greater pace. Huge stress Viswesvaran Balasubramanian, consultant, interventional pulmonology and sleep medicine, Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad, said though public health systems were geared to face the possibility of a third wave, viral variants with high transmissibility could put a huge stress on the existing healthcare infrastructure, given the population in India. “In addition, with children still unvaccinated and many adults yet to receive the second dose of the vaccine, a mutant variant at this time can result in rapid transmission and increased severity of disease in these susceptible populations,” he said. Doctors also said with mutations becoming inevitable, long-term preparations and strategic planning to live with the COVID-19 pandemic were essential. “At an individual level, compliance to pandemic norms like avoidance or limiting social gatherings, wearing masks in public spaces, and even indoors in homes with susceptible populations and adherence to hand sanitisation techniques should be followed,” said Dr. Balasubramanian. India had been successful in administering more than 100 crore vaccine doses, but these were mostly single dose and not the complete two doses of vaccination, which could be effective in fighting the new strain, said Ankita Baidya of infectious diseases department, HCMCT Manipal Hospitals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/new-waves-of-virus-anticipated-experts/article37714349.ece
27 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Russia, India, China meet reveals Indo-Pacific gap||The virtual meeting between the Foreign Ministers of Russia, India and China on Friday revealed the inherent differences among the three countries on the future of the Indo-Pacific region. The discussion among Sergey Lavrov, S. Jaishankar and Wang Yi revealed that Russia and China consider the Indo-Pacific an exclusive concept, while favouring the notion of “Asia-Pacific region” that they consider “inclusive”. A statement from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred to Mr. Lavrov’s comments in the meeting in which he reportedly described the Indo-Pacific region as “not a partnership of equals” and supported the notion of the Asia-Pacific as a more “inclusive and harmonious” framework. India, along with the U.S., Japan and Australia, has formed the quadrilateral framework to ensure free and open maritime lanes in the Indo-Pacific region. However, China’s statement indirectly disapproved of such initiatives. Mr. Lavrov, according to the Chinese statement, referred to such groupings as reminiscent of the Cold War. The statement referred to the “patchwork of small circles”, while indirectly referring to the Quad initiative and urged all three countries to jointly deal with global challenges. It referred to the Sino-Russian-Indian spirit of “openness, solidarity, trust and cooperation”, which can fight epidemics, and provide stability to the world, Mr. Wang referred to the “democracy trap” and opposed the upcoming “Summit of Democracies”, adding that the summit will bring out “negative energy”. Sources here confirmed on Friday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi “is likely to attend” the summit that will be chaired by U.S. President Joe Biden.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/russia-india-china-meet-shows-gaps-on-indo-pacific/article37714324.ece
27 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Won’t add to vaccine hesitancy: SC||The Supreme Court on Friday made it clear that it will not do anything to bring on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy even as it asked a petitioner to serve a copy of his plea to direct the Government for active surveillance of immunised people and publication of the exact number of deaths that occurred within 30 days of inoculation. “Look at the positivity of vaccination. We cannot send a message that there is some problem with the vaccination. The World Health Organization [WHO] has spoken in favour of vaccines, countries all over the world are vaccinating their citizens. We cannot cast any doubts,” Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, heading a Bench comprising Justice A.S. Bopanna, said. Appearing for petitioner Ajay Kumar Gupta, senior advocate Colin Gonsalves said people who had been vaccinated were not being taken for follow-ups. “There are no directives for a follow-up... Healthy people are collapsing and dying,” Mr. Gonsalves submitted. However, the Bench asked what the correlation between vaccine and the deaths was. It may not be attributable to the vaccine, it said. Mr. Gonsalves, however, said these deaths needed to be investigated. He said the Adverse Event Following Immunisation (AEFI) guidelines required health workers to check on the vaccinated population after a specific period, after which clearance ought to be given. These guidelines were revised in 2020, which only provide “passive surveillance” on the health status of inoculated persons, that too, on the request of the person concerned or the affected families. The Bench, however, observed orally that the revised guidelines provided a mechanism for tracking instances of serious and minor AEFI. It said the Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) had been tasked to keep an eye on the vaccinated population and provide monthly reports. “We do have a system. We have formulated the AEFI guidelines. There will always be dissenters. Policy cannot be as per them... It is of the highest national importance that we vaccinate,” the court said. The Bench asked Mr. Gonsalves to serve a copy of the petition and listed the case after two weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/wont-add-to-vaccine-hesitancy-sc/article37714334.ece
27 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Covishield had 63% strike rate against Delta: report||Two shots of Covishield gave 63% protection against symptomatic SARS-CoV2 infection and 85% protection against moderate or severe disease, said the results of a study conducted in Faridabad, Haryana, to assess the effectiveness of vaccines. The study notably was conducted during the second wave when the Delta variant was dominant. While several studies — as did the latest study — had shown that vaccination elicited fewer neutralising antibodies against the Delta variant compared to the wild type variant, the Haryana study found that there wasn’t any significant reduction in cellular immunity. This category of immunity, also called T cell immunity, resulted from the body learning to destroy the coronavirus after having being taught to do so from either a vaccination or a previous infection and was considered more long-lasting than the protection conferred from neutralising antibodies, which were produced within weeks of an inoculation or infection. Continue to be effective The Haryana study implied that the vaccines continued to be effective at their primary promise of protecting against severe disease and death regardless of the variants. Though India was now seeing a downswing in confirmed cases, several parts of Europe, Africa, the United States were seeing a surge in breakthrough infections, or those following full vaccination, prompting the roll out of booster doses in some countries. Concerns of a new variant, B.1.1.591 first discovered in South Africa have also emerged. The findings of the ChAdOx1 effectiveness of the Faridabad study, which appeared online in Lancet Infectious Diseases on Friday, were comparable to recent studies in England and Scotland that had reported effectiveness of 60–67% for the vaccine against infection by the Delta variant. To estimate the effectiveness of two doses of the ChAdOx1 vaccine, 2,379 confirmed cases and 1,981 controls (healthy individuals) were analysed. Around 85 (3.6%) cases were fully vaccinated compared with 168 (8.5%) controls. As many as 157(6.4%) of 2,451 cases and 181(9.1%) of 1,994 controls had received only one dose, giving a vaccine effectiveness of a single dose against SARS-CoV-2 infection of 46.2%. Among the 84 cases of moderate-to-severe COVID-19, only one (1.2%) was completely vaccinated compared with 84 (3.7%) of 2,295 cases with mild COVID-19. Sixteen deaths were reported in the unvaccinated or incomplete vaccination group, but none in the completely vaccinated group. The study was conducted at Employee State Insurance Corporation Medical College (ESICMC) Hospital (Faridabad, India) and the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (Faridabad, India) for RT-PCR testing for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection between April 1 and May 31, 2021. The two centres account for nearly 90% of all tests in Faridabad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/covishield-had-63-strike-rate-against-delta-variant/article37714341.ece
27 November 2021||November 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Disruption cannot be permanent parliamentary strategy||Disruption cannot be a permanent parliamentary strategy for the Opposition, according to senior Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Manoj K. Jha . In an interview, he talks about the need to prioritise people’s issues such as inflation and unemployment. Excerpts:  The Monsoon Session saw a series of disruptions, with very little constructive discussion. Do you expect a similar scenario in the Winter Session of Parliament? Neither would I expect nor would I desire on behalf of my party that the Winter Session should go the Monsoon Session way. It was not only working hours that we lost, but also opportunities to discuss important issues. The late Arun Jaitley had described disruptions as a valid parliamentary strategy. I believe, disruptions should only be episodic in nature for a day or for a few hours. If you adopt it as a permanent strategy, then it will harm the very idea of parliamentary discourse. Our party’s position is clear that there should be more deliberations over key legislation. There should be deliberative business along with legislative business. If possible, we must work extended hours during the Winter Session to make up for the time we have lost. There is a growing feeling that the Trinamool Congress led the disruptions in the last session, running away with the Opposition agenda. Do you share the sentiment? I wouldn’t say they ran away with the agenda, though I will say that any party should rise above their numbers and look at the larger picture. We [the RJD] may have only five members, but we may bring a set of issues which might be very, very important. For this, we need to have coordination among the Opposition parties that transcends the barriers. I am not denying that there are barriers. I wouldn’t blame anyone in particular, but I would rather say that many times political parties may have a misplaced sense of priorities or proportion. Pegasus was very important but so was the case of unemployment, which is spiralling out of control. Yet, we could not debate it. You say Parliament needs better coordination, but in the last session the Opposition met every day. Was that not enough? We need to have better mechanisms. And the mechanism should not be guided by the immediate interests of any party. It should be guided by what we owe to parliamentary democracy, why it is important to bring the people’s agenda on the floor. I know this Government is very vindictive in nature. I kn- ow we need to talk about the use of the CBI, the ED and the I-T Department. But, at the same time, we must also realise that inflation has severely hit people. COVID-19 second wave has taken away the livelihood of thousands of families. If these issues don’t find a space in our scheme of things, people will not forget us. In the last few months, the Opposition unity seems to be in disarray, many Congress leaders left the party to join the TMC. In Bihar, we saw the Congress and the RJD part ways for the byelections. How will this play out in future? I will answer the second part of your question first. Our parting ways with the Congress was episodic in nature. We had our differences over one Assembly constituency Kusheshwar Asthan. Tejashwi ji was keen that Musahar, the most marginalised of the Dalit community, must be represented, but the Congress was not on board. When we are in coalition, it is only natural to have some differences every now and then. As for the first part, every party has the right to enhance its footprint. But, keeping 2024 in mind, you have to see this within a larger perspective of keeping the people first. This kind of politics may not be helpful.

Speaking to The Hindu , NFAI Director Prakash Magdum said the acquisition was significant as it showcased a near-forgotten actor-comedian, whose style was to meld social issues with conventional entertainment. “Bhagwan Dada, born Bhagwan Palav in Maharashtra, came from an extremely humble family… While his biggest hit was undoubtedly the socially conscious Albela in the early 1950s, the films that we have acquired give a wonderful insight into the film-making process of the late 1940s and 1950s in features that had lower budgets yet aspired to deliver quality entertainment,” Mr. Magdum said.  Lalach (1948) and Bachke Rehana (1949) were two of the films that Bhagwan acted in and directed. Others in the list include Sinbad the Sailor (1952) – a Bollywood version of the Arabian nights, which paired south Indian actor Ranjan with Nirupa Roy. “At least eight among these 31 films are extremely hard to find and are fortunately in good condition. Both films directed by Bhagwan had music by the great C. Ramchandra,” Mr. Magdum said. The collection was also extremely unique as it showcased a number of legends in their period of “false starts” before they found their respective metiers within film-making. Some of the films had Manna Dey composing music, Talat Mahmood trying his hand as the “leading man”, and Roy and Lalita Pawar’s early performances as heroines. Most of these films were in black and white, and in the 16 mm format.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/a-treasure-trove-for-hindi-cinemas-golden-era/article37714346.ece
27 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||India in talks with Pak. over Afghan aid||India is in talks with Pakistan to firm up the “modalities” for sending humanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan, an official said here on Friday. At the weekly press briefing here, the Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said India took the initiative to send food and medicines to Afghanistan in the first week of October, and added that New Delhi does not seek to place “conditionalities” while sending humanitarian assistance. “India has always stood by the people of Afghanistan, be it [regarding] humanitarian support or development assistance. We received on Wednesday a response from the Government of Pakistan to our proposal made on October 7, 2021, for providing humanitarian assistance of 50,000 metric tonnes of wheat and lifesaving medicines that we want to send to the people of Afghanistan. We are examining the response of the Government of Pakistan. We are also working on the modalities with the Pakistan side,” said Mr. Bagchi. The need for the transit facility was taken up on November 12 by a delegation led by Taliban’s Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Islamabad. Following the meeting, the office of the Prime Minister of Pakistan said Islamabad would “favourably” consider the proposal. Mr. Bagchi highlighted that the proposal to send wheat and medicines came from the Indian side in the first week of October, hinting that Pakistan has taken several weeks to agree to the proposal. A senior official indicated that India expects Pakistan to speed up the process. The vast consignment of wheat and medicines is expected to be sent by hundreds of trucks that will crisscross Pakistan. The other possibility is sending them through the Iranian port of Chabahar which was ruled out because of practical difficulties on the Afghanistan-Iran border.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-in-talks-with-pak-over-afghan-aid/article37714322.ece
27 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Venugopal pushes for national courts of appeal||Attorney-General of India K.K. Venugopal argued on the front foot in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana on Constitution Day for the revival of a 11-year-old proposal to set up national courts of appeal in four regions of the country. He said four courts of appeal with 15 judges each could act as intermediate appellate courts between the State High Courts and the Supreme Court. They would absorb matrimonial disputes, rent control cases and other such cases that clog the Supreme Court, adding to pendency. The judgments of these courts of appeal would be final, he said. “These courts would also mean that we are adding 60 judges who would be taking over these cases. Pendency would be cut down to a very great extent. Cases could be disposed of in three or four years’ time,” Mr. Venugopal said on Friday. This would unburden the Supreme Court, which could focus on interpreting constitutional questions of law, references and death sentence cases. Supreme Court judges could hear cases leisurely, read and write better judgments with time on their hands, Mr. Venugopal argued at an event organised by the Supreme Court to celebrate Constitution Day. In fact, the Supreme Court would not need 34 judges. Just 15 would be ample. These judges of the Supreme Court could sit in three Constitution Benches. “There has to be rethinking of the entire structure of the Supreme Court as it exists today. No point brushing it under the carpet. Are we aware of the suffering litigants undergo? We have inherited a system that is extremely cumbersome. Government and judiciary have to put their heads together. We have included access to justice as a fundamental right, but we are probably violating the fundamental right by continuing with this system,” the country’s top law officer said. Starting his speech with the question “Is the Supreme Court truly a constitutional court?” Mr. Venugopal said it would need a “very, very bold person” to start a litigation. He said cases remain pending in the Supreme Court for 10 years. It would have reached the Supreme Court after spending a decade each at the trial and high court levels. “A person does not even know when his case would conclude and whether he would be alive to see the fruits of the litigation he had started,” Mr. Venugopal said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/venugopal-pushes-for-national-courts-of-appeal/article37714576.ece
27 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Curtains on sixth edition of India-France Army exercise||The 6th edition of the biennial India-France Army exercise ‘Ex Shakti-2021’ culminated after 12 days of intense joint military training, which the Army said proved to be “another remarkable milestone towards the pledge of terrorism-free world”. “The exercise provided opportunity to both the contingents to train in Counter Terrorism operations in joint environment under United Nations charter,” an Army statement said. This edition of the exercise hosted by France saw the two sides exhibiting their combat power and dominance over the extremist groups in simulated counter-insurgency, counterterrorism environment. The exercise was conducted in two phases involving combat conditioning and tactical training of counterterrorism operations, culminating with validation of training in semi-urban environment. Stating that both the contingents shared their best operational practices and experiences, the statement said troops of both the Armies developed bonhomie by not only involving in tactical exercises but also rubbing shoulders in sports and cultural activities. “The exercise has certainly added another dimension to ever-enhancing military diplomacy between both the participating countries,” the Army added. India and France have steadily deepened their defence cooperation, and France has emerged as one of India’s top strategic partners.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/curtains-on-sixth-edition-of-india-france-army-exercise/article37714335.ece
27 November 2021||New Delhi,||Govt. undermining Constitution: Cong.||The Congress on Friday justified the Opposition’s boycott of the Constitution Day function in the Central Hall of Parliament by arguing that it was to protest against the “authoritarian” functioning of the Narendra Modi Government that enacts laws bypassing parliamentary scrutiny and “insults” parliamentary democracy. Hitting back at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his comment that family-run parties go against the spirit of democracy, Deputy Leader of the Congress in the Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma said Mr. Modi should remember that he became Prime Minister in 2014 because democracy has been strengthened since 1947. “The Prime Minister should introspect.... He should not give sermons to other parties. It would be better if the Election Commission continues to do its work,” Mr. Sharma told reporters. The Congress leader said the boycott was to “remind” the country that “the Constitution” was being undermined every day under the present regime. The Constitution Day event was reduced to a Government event and the Opposition leaders were invited to be “part of the audience and not participants”, he said. Apart from the Congress, several other parties including the Left parties, Trinamool Congress, DMK, NCP, Shiv Sena, IUML, RSP and the RJD had skipped the event.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-undermining-constitution-cong/article37714306.ece
27 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC seeks Centre, Asthana’s response to plea by NGO||The Supreme Court on Friday took on board a plea filed by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), an NGO represented by advocate Prashant Bhushan, to quash the appointment of Rakesh Asthana as Delhi Police Commissioner. A Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud issued notice to the Union Government and Mr. Asthana. The Government is represented by Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta, and senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi appeared for Mr. Asthana. They have been given two weeks to file their counter affidavits. Mr. Bhushan urged the court to take up the case after two weeks. The writ petition has urged the court to cancel an order of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on July 27, granting Mr. Asthana inter-cadre deputation from Gujarat to Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram and Union Territory (AGMUT) cadre. The ACC, by the same order, had extended his service. Mr. Asthana was appointed Delhi Police Commissioner merely four days before his superannuation. The CPIL has asked the court to direct the Government to take steps for a fresh appointment strictly in accordance with the directions of the Supreme Court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-seeks-centre-asthanas-response-to-plea-by-ngo/article37714317.ece
27 November 2021||Mumbai,||13 years on, Mumbai terror case trial continues in NIA court||Thirteen years after 12 well co-ordinated terror attacks rocked Mumbai and resulted in the death of almost 175 people, the trial is still going on before the National Investigation Agency (NIA) court. The trial, essentially against Syed Zabiuddin Ansari, alias Abu Jundal, a suspected Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operative who allegedly coordinated the 26/11 terror attacks from Karachi, was stayed by the Bombay High Court on April 20, 2018. The High Court stayed the proceedings as a petition by the Delhi Police against a Sessions Court order is pending. The lower court had asked the police to provide the accused the travel documents of his trip from Saudi Arabia to Delhi in 2012. On April 9, 2018, the last witness to depose before the NIA court was Jundal’s childhood friend who told the court that he recognised Jundal’s voice in a 28-minute recording played in the court. It was a conversation that took place in a control room in Pakistan from where Jundal allegedly gave instructions to the terrorists during the attack. In February 2016, a crucial witness, David Coleman Headley, alias Daood Gilani, named Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief and 26/11 mastermind Hafiz Saeed as the head of the LeT and his chief operational commander Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi. Headley is convicted in the U.S. for his role in the Mumbai attacks and was deposing from an undisclosed location. He described the LeT as “a militant organisation in Pakistan, whose goal is to fight the Indian Army and assist the people of Kashmir” and which carried out terror activities “all over India”. Special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam said even after 13 years, there has been no headway with Pakistan on Saeed and Lakhvi. “From David Headley, we gathered all the evidence and email correspondence from the ISI and the LeT and everything is shared with Pakistan but they are not acting upon it. We also requested them to examine Headley to have a concrete case against Saeed and Lakhvi but they are in a state of denial.” While Jundal continues to be lodged at Arthur Road Jail, 15 more witnesses are yet to be examined.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/13-years-on-mumbai-terror-case-trial-continues-in-nia-court/article37714328.ece
27 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Resumption of international flights comes amid new variant||After nearly 20 months, the Ministry of Civil Aviation on Friday announced the resumption of scheduled international flights to and from India from December 15. The decision, however, comes even as several countries are tightening travel restrictions after a new coronavirus variant was identified in South Africa. The announcement is likely to result in a fall in airfares on key routes as well as allow travellers to take via flights, which was banned under the air bubble arrangements India signed with 31 countries as an interim measure. “Due to prevailing COVID-19 situation, the capacity entitlements shall be as per the category of countries based on enlistment of countries as at-risk from time to time by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare,” the Ministry of Civil Aviation said in an order issued on Friday. It said countries outside the “at-risk” list will be allowed 100% of pre-COVID flights. Countries in the “at-risk” list, but with whom India has an air-bubble will be allowed 75% of pre-COVID flights, while those with which India doesn’t have air-bubbles will be allowed 50% of pre-pandemic flights. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on Friday identified 11 countries as well as all of Europe as “at risk”. These 11 countries are South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/scheduled-international-flights-to-be-resumed/article37714312.ece
27 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC orders on Tripura not being followed: Sibal||Senior advocate Kapil Sibal on Friday made an urgent mentioning in the Supreme Court, alleging “mayhem” in Tripura where the municipal elections are under way. The senior lawyer urged a Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud to hear the case in the course of the day. The request came just 24 hours after the court ordered additional deployment of Central Armed Police Forces to be moved across the State to protect the electoral process. It also directed the State and the police to not hinder the media from reporting the elections. “No two battalions of CAPF... Media was to be given unhindered access. It is mayhem there,” Mr. Sibal submitted. He claimed to have electronic evidence to show that the orders of the top court were not being followed. However, Justice Chandrachud, who was heading a different Bench from the one he was heading on November 25, expressed doubts about hearing the matter on the same day. The November 25 order of the top court was based on petitions, including one filed by the Trinamool Congress, alleging intimidation and violence in Tripura prior to the elections. The CPI (M) had also intervened in the court, alleging attacks on party workers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-orders-on-tripura-not-being-followed-sibal/article37714304.ece
27 November 2021||November 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Omicron new variant of concern, says WHO||Belgium is the first European Union (EU) country to announce a case of the variant. The 27-nation EU imposed a temporary ban on air travel from southern Africa, and stocks tumbled in Asia, Europe and the U.S. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points. The S&P 500 index was down 2.3%, on pace for its worst day since February. The price of oil plunged nearly 12%. “The last thing we need is to bring in a new variant that will cause even more problems,” German Health Minister Jens Spahn said. The member nations of the EU have experienced a massive spike in cases recently. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said flights will have to “be suspended until we have a clear understanding about the danger posed by this new variant, and travelers returning from this region should respect strict quarantine rules.” Israel, one of the world’s most vaccinated countries, announced that it also detected its first case of the new variant in a traveler who returned from Malawi. After a 10-hour overnight trip, passengers aboard KLM Flight 598 from Capetown, South Africa, to Amsterdam were held on the edge of the runway on Friday at Schiphol airport for four hours pending special testing. Passengers aboard a flight from Johannesburg were also being isolated and tested. Some experts said the variant’s emergence illustrated how rich countries’ hoarding of vaccines threatens to prolong the pandemic. Fewer than 6% of people in Africa have been fully immunised against COVID-19, and millions of health workers and vulnerable populations have yet to receive a single dose. Those conditions can speed up spread of the virus, offering more opportunities for it to evolve into a dangerous variant.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/omicron-new-variant-of-concern-says-who/article37714570.ece

Quoting Mr. Goyal, Mr. Reddy said it was impossible to tell how much will be procured. Mr. Reddy said the Centre, however, came close to accepting the State’s claims that paddy was cultivated in kharif of this year to over 62 lakh acres. After much dilly dallying and initial refusal to accept the State’s estimates, the Centre said it had used satellite data that showed crop in over 58 lakh acres. He expressed the disappointment of himself and other Ministers after talks. Mr. Reddy said the delegation had conveyed to Mr. Goyal the instigation by BJP leaders to farmers to cultivate paddy in rabi. Mr. Goyal assured them that the government will advise BJP leaders not to indulge in it. Mr. Reddy told The Hindu over phone that Mr. Goyal had asked the State government to forget procurement of paddy in rabi as it was already made clear by the Centre. Mr. Reddy regretted that the decision of the Centre was politically motivated. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao will take a call on what to do next. The State government had anxiously awaited Friday’s decision of the Centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-not-to-buy-paddy/article37714907.ece

Few other struggles can claim such a victory,” said All India Kisan Sabha general secretary Hannan Mollah. Many farmers and leaders from Punjab, especially those without political affiliations outside the State, seem hopeful that the victory means they can go home after the year-long agitation. “We have won. We will now wait to see that Parliament actually repeals the laws and that the committee [mentioned by the PM] has a strong farmers’ voice,” said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary of the Dhakaunda faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). “We want to safeguard MSP also. But for many farmers in Punjab and Haryana, who are already getting MSP through Government procurement, it was the repeal of the three laws that was the most critical factor and they feel the struggle is over,” said another Punjab leader who did not wish to be named. In Uttar Pradesh, on the other hand, the majority of farmers are yet to benefit from Government procurement at MSP rates and a legal guarantee would have more significance for them. “MSP must be recognised as the right of all farmers, not just a few. We will continue to fight until all farmers get their due,” said Rakesh Tikait.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/skm-leaders-to-meet-today-to-decide-next-step/article37714315.ece

Municipal corporations of the State capital Agartala and 19 others went to polls on November 25. The party said before the polling day, gangs of BJP men began visiting houses in Agartala and other towns, and threatening CPI(M) candidates, polling agents and local leaders, warning them not to go out on polling day. They were threatened with physical violence and told their families would be driven out of their houses. There were extensive booth capturing by BJP goons on polling day and and voters were physically stopped in many places, it alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tripura-civic-elections-a-farce-says-cpi-m/article37714309.ece

The Chief Justice said “no one can forget” the pivotal role played by the legal community in the freedom struggle. “None can forget the contributions of lawyers such as Mahatma Gandhi, Dr. B.R Ambedkar, Jawaharlal Nehru, Lala Lajpat Rai, Sardar Patel and Alladi Krishnaswamy Iyer, whose dedication and sacrifices for the cause of the people are legendary... All of us here are successors of that glorious legacy,” the CJI told the audience of Supreme Court judges and lawyers at the programme organised by the Supreme Court Bar Association.

The case was registered in December 2019 on the basis of a preliminary enquiry initiated by the CBI on September 8, 2017, into the alleged commission of gross misconduct by Justice Shukla and others. The Medical Council of India (MCI) had barred the Prasad Institute of Medical Sciences in May 2017 from admitting students for two years due to substandard facilities and non-fulfilment of criteria. Similar action had been taken against 46 other medical institutions. The Trust challenged the order in the Supreme Court. Subsequently, it is alleged, a conspiracy was hatched and the petition withdrawn with the court’s permission. Then, another petition was filed before a Division Bench of the Allahabad HC in Lucknow on August 24, 2017. The next day, Mr. Quddusi and the institute’s chairman met Justice Shukla at his residence and “delivered illegal gratification”. According to the CBI, the petition was heard later that day by the Division Bench comprising Justice Shukla and a favourable order was passed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cbi-gets-sanction-to-prosecute-hc-ex-judge/article37714314.ece

27 November 2021||November 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Path to moksha||Bhuthath Azhwar believes that devotion to the Lord is a sure means to mukti. In his hymns that comprise the second Tiruvandadi, he highlights the boundless compassion of the Lord whose unfathomable greatness is hailed even by the scriptures. But He is held to assume many forms such as Para, Vyuha, Vibhava, Archa and Antaryami to enable us to know, approach and worship Him. The first two find a place in his references to Paramapada and Tiruparkadal. When he sings on the archa form of the Lord at Tiruvengadam, many a time he shifts the focus to the Vibhava forms such as Rama and Krishna avatars as well, pointed out Sri A. K. Sundarrajan in a discourse. He recalls Rama avatar when beholding the Lord Srinivasa. Is He not the same Rama who assumed a human form in Treta Yuga to put an end to Ravana's atrocities? Of course, the Lord could have killed Ravana from His abode if only He wished. But He underwent many difficulties, crossed the ocean and went to Lanka to kill the demon. Even then, Rama hesitated to kill Ravana initially out of compassion. Valmiki, when extolling Rama's exceptional qualities, uses the epithet Jita-kroda, meaning one who has conquered anger. Rama had to summon His anger and then vanquish the demon. Likewise it is with the Lord's help that the jivatma can overcome the evil tendencies and vasanas. Azhwar compares devotion to a lamp where the desire to savour His auspicious qualities is the ghee; the thoughts about the bliss of God experience in the mind is the wick. Any sincere devotee with such total awareness of the Lord in thought, word and deed, can light the flame of devotion and keep it alive. He alone can grant Moksha, and one can seek His grace to be freed from further birth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/path-to-moksha/article37714332.ece

27 November 2021||PATNA,||‘Implement prohibition law effectively’||After taking a pledge that he would neither consume liquor nor take part in any activity related to it, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Friday said hooch deaths in the State must be highlighted to spread the message to people that liquor consumption was not only bad but also dangerous. Mr. Kumar also asserted that prohibition in the State would continue and appealed to officials to implement the law effectively without any discrimination. Along with Mr. Kumar, his Cabinet colleagues and officials too took the pledge. “You must ensure that your officials take the pledge by actually reading it and not just keeping the paper in hand. They should remain committed to the pledge,” the Chief Minister urged the Chief Secretary and the Director-General of Police. Earlier, the Chief Secretary wrote to all District Magistrates, Superintendents of Police and department heads to ensure that all officials take the pledge. Over three dozen people have died due to consumption of illegal liquor in the State over the last few months. Mr. Kumar rubbished Opposition leaders’ argument that because of prohibition in the State, there was a huge loss of revenue to the State exchequer. ‘No loss of revenue’ “Rather, it has gone up. In the first year of prohibition, it had come down a little bit, but later, it has gone up. There is no loss of revenue due to prohibition in the State,” he said. The tourism sector too got a boost and more tourists started to visit Bihar after prohibition, Mr. Kumar said. “It’s a myth that if no liquor is served, tourist inflow will be less in a State. In Bihar, more tourists have visited the State since prohibition,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/implement-prohibition-law-effectively/article37714331.ece

The visit will coincide with the India-Russia “2+2” meeting of the Foreign and Defence Ministers. ‘Strategic ties’ “The leaders will review the state and prospects of bilateral relations and discuss ways to further strengthen the strategic partnership.

27 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||After a year, farmers keen to return home||A year after the protests against the three farm laws began, farmers thronged the three protest sites surrounding Delhi determined to flaunt their “historic victory” in convin- cing the Government to accede to their demand. “It is a monumental achievement that after 12 months, the farmers have forced this obstinate Prime Minister to blink, and to bend down. Few other struggles can claim such a victory,” said All India Kisan Sabha general secretary Hannan Mollah. Many farmers and leaders from Punjab, especially those without political affiliations outside the State, seem hopeful that the victory means they can go home. “We will now wait to see that Parliament actually repeals the laws and that the committee [mentioned by the PM] has a strong farmers’ voice,” said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary of the Dhakaunda faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). He indicated that the composition, tenure and mandate of the committee would have to be scrutinised, but hoped that “if the conditions are right, then we can go back”. “The MSP must be recognised as the right of all farmers, not just a few. We will continue to fight until all farmers get their due,” said Rakesh Tikait, who heads a western Uttar Pradesh faction of the BKU.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/after-a-year-farmers-keen-to-return-home/article37714572.ece

In a short video released by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on the 26/11 attacks, Mr. Modi also said that today’s India is combating terrorism with a “new policy and new ways” as he paid tributes to the victims of the strikes.

27 November 2021||November 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Family-based parties a threat to democracy: PM||“India is heading towards a kind of crisis, which is a matter of concern for those who believe in democracy,” Mr. Modi said in reference to family-based political parties. “More than one person from a family joining the party on the basis of merit does not make the party dynastic. Problems arise when a party is run by the same family, generation after generation,” he said. “How can parties that have lost their democratic character protect democracy,” he said. In another reference to the current schisms in politics, the Prime Minister said even in a background of diversity and the bitterness of Partition, leaders had put the nation first in adopting the Constitution, a situation that isn’t prevalent now. “Imagine if we had to write a Constitution. Looking at the current scenario, we may not be able to write a single page of the Constitution,” he said. Around 14 opposition parties including the Congress, DMK, Trinamool Congress, CPI, CPI(M), Rashtriya Janata Dal, Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) stayed away from the function. Later in the day, addressing an event organised by the Supreme Court to mark Constitution Day, the Prime Minister flayed what he termed not just the “colonial mindset” of developed countries which was putting obstacles in the way of developed countries taking the same development trajectory as them, but also Indians who were using rights like freedom of expression to block progress. “India is the only country in the process of achieving goals of the Paris Agreement ahead of time. And yet, in the name of the environment, various pressures are created on India. All this is the result of a colonial mentality. Unfortunately, due to such a mentality, obstacles are put in the development of our own country, sometimes in the name of freedom of expression and sometimes with the help of something else,” he said. “We have to remove it (obstacles to development). And for this, our biggest strength, our biggest inspiration, is our Constitution,” he said. Remarking that both the judiciary and the government were born of the “womb of the Constitution” the two complement each other. “On the strong foundation of separation of power, we have to pave the path of collective responsibility, create a roadmap, determine goals and take the country to its destination,” he said. Chief Justice of India N. V. Ramana, Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and U.U. Lalit, and Union Law Minister Kiren Rijiju were present at the function.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/family-based-parties-a-threat-to-democracy-pm/article37714302.ece

27 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||151 streets inundated as city receives 47 mm of rainfall||A total of 151 streets in 63 residential areas were inundated on Friday as the city received over 47 mm of rainfall from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. The flooding reduced significantly on a number of streets in areas such as T. Nagar, owing to the completion of work on a new network of underground pipes. Engineers said the huge underground pipes would carry excess floodwater through many roads of T. Nagar, diverting it through multiple routes, towards the Mambalam canal, which drains into the Adyar after passing through 5.7 km of congested areas. As many as 638 residents were provided accommodation and food in flood shelters at five localities of the city. A total of 91 shelters were opened for residents in low-lying areas near major waterways such as Kosasthalaiyar, Adyar, Cooum and Buckingham Canal. Release of water from the Poondi reservoir has been the highest among the waterbodies in and around the city, with a discharge of 4,248 cusecs on Friday. At least 120 of the 847 pumps have been used to bail out water from inundated areas. A total of 21 subways remained open without any water stagnation. Work on removing water from the Rangarajapuram subway is underway. A total of 2,386 residents received food packets on Friday. Health officials have organised 559 mobile medical camps and 265 permanent camps at residential areas. At least 4.54 lakh residents have visited the camps this month. Officials said work on development of underground pipes was tried as an innovative idea as part of flood control measures. More underground pipes The Greater Chennai Corporation is planning to develop more underground pipes after studying the outcome of the initiative. Teams of engineers have been sent to each flooded locality to study the local civic issues, conduct brainstorming sessions and implement the project. “Our innovations have worked so far, with over 50 mm rain too,” an official said. Flooding was reduced in stretches such as Bazulla Road and Vijayaraghava Road after the new pipes started diverting excess flood waters, in addition to the existing drains. Roads in Pulianthope and Kolathur have also reported a reduction in water stagnation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/151-streets-inundated-as-city-receives-47-mm-of-rainfall/article37714713.ece
27 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Courts bound to protect interest of deities: Madras HC||Temple properties are owned by deities, considered a perpetual minor as per law. A High Court, being the custodian of such minors, is bound to protect the interest of the deities and prevent attempts to squat over the properties by misusing the litigative process, the Madras High Court has said. Justice S.M. Subramaniam made the observations while dismissing a writ petition filed by a nonagenarian who was in occupation of Coimbatore Maagaliamman temple property since 1960 and wanted the lease to continue perpetually for his son, who was assisting him now in conducting business at the property. After finding that the temple administration was entitled to lease out properties only for a period of five years and any extension beyond that required an approval from the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Commissioner, the judge said the petitioner had not produced such approval. He also found that the lessee had been paying a monthly rent of Rs. 4,000 for a long time and when it was increased to Rs. 17,200 a month recently, he had filed the present case, seeking a copy of the HR&CE Joint Commissioner’s proceedings based on which the temple Thakkar had increased the monthly rent. Holding that the petitioner has no semblance of legal right to maintain the writ petition and that he could not be construed as a leaseholder at present in the absence of HR&CE Commissioner’s approval, the judge directed the department to initiate eviction proceedings as per Section 78 of the HR&CE Act of 1959. “Great Souls donated their hard-earned money to religious institutions with an expectation that their donations will be utilised for the benefit of the temple. If their wishes are not honoured, the competent authorities and the trustees are not only committing a sin but also infringing upon the right of the minor deity,” the judge said.

27 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Chief Minister rolls out Data Centre Policy||The Tamil Nadu Government has come out with a Data Centre Policy, in which it has doled out incentives to projects with an investment of over Rs. 500 crore and those that meet at least 30% of their energy requirement with renewable energy sources. The policy will be applicable to data centres incorporated from April 1, 2021, to March 31, 2026. The policy, released by Chief Minister M.K. Stalin at the 20th edition of CII Connect 2021, says that data centre units/parks can purchase power from the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco), at prevailing industrial tariff, as per the norms of the governing Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission (TNERC). They are eligible for 100% subsidy of tax on power purchased from Tangedco or generated and consumed from captive sources for five years from the date of commencement of commercial operation. As per the latest tariff order, the State Government charges 60% of the conventional cross-subsidy charge for wind energy and 70% of the conventional charge for solar energy for third-party open access consumers. The government has now said that the same shall be extended to data centre units and parks. Units with a sanctioned load of 50 MW or more shall be provided dual power (two different grids from two different locations/providers). “The policy addresses critical factors of considerations such as power connections, multi-level stacking of generators and car parking provisions, among other things, along with single-window clearances and stamp duty concessions. The policy also promotes investments in tier-2 and tier-3 cities and green building data centers with incentives,” Jerry Kingsley, senior director, capital markets and data centre advisory, Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), said. In terms of stamp duty, if a firm wants to set up a centre in A and B-category districts, 50% concession will be given for the purchase/lease of land obtained from Electronics Corporation of Tamil Nadu Limited (ELCOT)/SIDCO/SIPCOT. In the case of C-category districts, 100% stamp duty exemption will be given. In category-C districts, data centres/parks can avail a 50% subsidy on land cost from ELCOT/SIPCOT/SIDCO. On private lands procured for data centres/parks, 50% subsidy on the cost of land, as per the guideline value, shall be given up to an extent of 10 acres, and subject to land cost not exceeding 20% of EFA (eligible fixed assets) and a cap of Rs. 2 crore, and with at least 70% of land being used for data centre operations. Data centre developers will also be encouraged to set up centres within IT Special Economic Zones (SEZs), developed by ELCOT. ELCOT will work with the ICT Academy to design and conduct courses specific to data centre operations. The State Government has signed MoUs for an investment of over Rs. 18,000 crore in data centres during the financial year 2020-21. Earlier this week, the Chief Minister signed six new deals in the data centre space.  The policy addresses critical factors of considerations such as power connections... along with single-window clearances and stamp duty concessions Jerry Kingsley Senior director, capital markets and data centre advisory, JLL||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamil-nadu-govt-rolls-out-data-centre-policy/article37714656.ece
27 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Alert upgraded to red in coastal districts||With the cyclonic circulation moving over the Comorin area and the adjoining Sri Lankan coast, steady spells of heavy rain are expected to continue in the State, particularly over the coastal belt and the adjoining districts, during the weekend. The Meteorological Department has upgraded the alert to red for districts along the Tamil Nadu coast for Saturday. While the intensity is expected to be up to very heavy in most of these districts, legends have been changed to indicate the impact of rainfall, be it inundation, damages or filling up of waterbodies, and help government agencies be alert and take necessary action, officials said. S. Balachandran, deputy director general of meteorology, said: “We have issued the red alert to indicate the impact of the expected rainfall over a particular place. It is based on the rain received earlier and does not necessarily indicate the intensity of the rain. Only one or two places will receive extremely heavy rain and not the entire coastal belt.” Torrential downpour with loud thunders continued on Friday in many parts. Karaikal received heavy rain of 9.1 cm and Nagapattinam 6 cm till 5.30 p.m. Waterlogging returned to several areas in Chennai, as steady and widespread rain lashed the city since Thursday. West Tambaram and Nandanam received 4 cm of rain, Nungambakkam, Villivakkam and Anna University 3 cm and Meenambakkam, MRC Nagar, Chembarambakkam and Taramani 2 cm till Friday evening. Heavy rain is likely to continue in Chennai till Monday. During the past 24 hours, intense rain pounded Thoothukudi district. Kayalpattinam received a whopping 31 cm of rainfall — the highest recorded in the State till Friday morning. The slow-moving system may trigger severe rain in many districts till Sunday. The Meteorological Department has forecast scattered heavy rain in eight districts, including Tirunelveli, Tenkasi, Chennai and its neighbouring districts for Saturday. On Sunday too, intense rain is likely in Chennai and its neighbourhood and Villupuram. The delta districts and other places, including Madurai, Karaikal, Ariyalur and Tiruchi, may experience heavy rain in some areas. Mr. Balachandran said the weather system, which now lies close to the coast, is pushing in new rainbands. It is moving westwards and if it continues to be slow, the State may continue to receive consistent rain on Sunday. On the fresh low-pressure area brewing over the south Andaman sea and further gaining strength, he said the system is still far away from Tamil Nadu and its movement is being monitored.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/alert-upgraded-to-red-in-coastal-districts/article37714694.ece

Health Minister Ma. Subramanian told reporters on Friday that based on the directive from the Union Ministry, the Health Secretary had issued instructions to all Collectors. “The Union Health Ministry had laid down guidelines on the testing of travellers from certain countries and COVID-19 protocols. We will intensify the measures and screen travellers from countries such as South Africa and Hong Kong and follow guidelines, including for quarantine,” he said. Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan added that Tamil Nadu was the first to make RT-PCR negative reports mandatory for travellers from any country. “For some countries, we brought in testing on arrival. This already includes travellers from South Africa, Botswana and Hong Kong. As per the directive on testing travellers transiting through these countries, we will tighten RT-PCR testing through the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine,” he said. Countries such as Brazil, Bangladesh, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe and Singapore are already included. New recruitment A total of 7,296 posts — 4,848 of nurses and 2,448 health inspectors — are being created for Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam . These posts will be filled soon, the Health Minister said. In the last one-and-a-half years, over 12,000 staff, recruited on a temporary basis, have been working in COVID-19 management. Of them, 4,570 are nurses and 1,646 health inspectors. A small number of them were recruited through the Medical Services Recruitment Board and on compassionate grounds. Though their term ended, the Chief Minister has extended their work period till December, he said, adding that it was not possible to regularise all of them. “However, on a humanitarian basis, we will grant 20 marks to those who worked during COVID-19, while recruiting for the 7,296 posts. They will be marked based on parameters such as diploma or degree, place of work and residence,” the Health Minister explained. The recruitment will be conducted through the district health societies, he said. Treating the injured The State Government’s new initiative, ‘Nammai Kaakkum 48’,  to cater to people injured in accidents, will be launched in 609 hospitals — 204 government facilities and 405 private ones — situated along the highways, by December 15. He said 500 places where accidents occurred frequently had been identified. The number of fully equipped ambulances to cater to emergency cases will be increased from 124 to 300, he said. A legislation to provide medical services in emergency cases will be tabled during the next Assembly session, and it will cover people, irrespective of the districts and States they are from, Mr. Subramanian said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamil-nadu-to-intensify-screening-at-airports/article37714696.ece

Stalin on Friday urged schools not to hesitate to act on complaints of sexual harassment received from women and children. And he urged parents not to decide against going public with complaints. In his televised message on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, he encouraged women and children to come forward and file complaints in case of sexual harassment. Mr. Stalin said he was in agony over the recent incidents of harassment of women and children, some of whom had ended their lives. While women and children were sexually harassed at public places, “only a few incidents come to light and others are being hidden”. Pointing to the laws available to deal with such cases, Mr. Stalin said, “I assure [you] that these persons [offenders] will be brought to justice under these laws.” Children could lodge complaints with school teachers and headmasters, parents and the school management. “Those in the administration should not hesitate to act on complaints, presuming that doing so would bring disrepute to their schools.” The Chief Minister said that dealing with offences against women and children was more important for his Government than all other issues, and his Government had been taking immediate action on complaints of sexual harassment. “This Government would not hesitate to bring offenders to book, irrespective of their status.” Any affected child should at once call Childline at 1098. “I have ordered the Department of Social Welfare and Women Empowerment to protect the identity [of callers] and take immediate action.” Mr. Stalin said schools and colleges should ensure the safety of girl students. Parents should talk to their children and not lead isolated lives within their households. “We have the responsibility to ensure your protection. Not only as a Chief Minister but also as a father, I have the responsibility to protect you all. I plead with you all not to end your lives,” he said. ( Assistance for overcoming suicidal thoughts is available on the State’s health helpline 104 and Sneha’s suicide prevention helpline 044-24640050 )  We have the responsibility to ensure your protection.

Ramachandran, who donated one of her kidneys to him in 1984, died here on Thursday. She was the daughter of MGR’s elder brother M.G. Chakrapani. She was 72, and is survived by two daughters. One of her brothers, M.G.C. Sukumar, has acted in a few films. “She was not well and was admitted to hospital. She recovered and returned home, but died on Thursday night,” said M.G. Rajendran, her brother. When MGR, following renal failure, was battling for life at the Brooklyn hospital in the U.S. in 1984, Leelavathi and Mr. Rajendran were chosen for donating the kidney. She was finally chosen to be the donor, as her kidney suited MGR the best. Leelavathi was living in Chelakkara in Kerala, and her husband, Ravindranathan, was a doctor there. When MGR was seriously ill and shifted to the U.S. for treatment, she rushed to Chennai and agreed to donate one of her kidneys. Thereafter, she settled in Chennai in 1989. “She and her family extended support to the BJP, when my son, M.C.R. Praveen, joined the party. We also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” recalled Mr. Rajendran. It happened in 2017, when MGR’s birth centenary was celebrated. AIADMK coordinator O. Panneerselvam, co-coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami, late AIADMK leader Jayalalithaa’s aide V.K. Sasikala and AMMK general secretary T.T.V. Dhinakaran condoled the death of Leelavathi. In their joint message, Mr. Paneerselvam and Mr. Palaniswami said they were deeply saddened by her death and recalled her deed of donating one of her kidneys to MGR. Senior AIADMK leaders D. Jayakumar, B. Valarmathi, J.C.D. Prabhakar, K.P.

Ramadoss on Friday said that increase in the price of thread by almost 40% has affected the handloom and textile industries and will have an adverse impact on the economy of Tamil Nadu. He called for a temporary ban on export of thread and cotton to stop the rise in prices and increase production of cotton as a long-term solution. In a statement, Dr. Ramadoss said that Tamil Nadu was the leading exporter of handloom, textiles and clothing and the industry was responsible for bringing in foreign exchange. “The textile and handloom companies in Tiruppur have called for a one-day strike against the increase in price of thread. More than 25,000 handlooms have not been operating in districts such as Namakkal, Tenkasi and Salem in protest and almost 50,000 workers have lost their jobs. The production output has dropped,” he said. Export of thread and cotton without any control was the reason for the rise in prices. “Tamil Nadu Paruthi Corporation should be formed to produce the thread,” Mr. Ramadoss said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ramadoss-calls-for-ban-on-export-of-cotton-thread/article37714727.ece

27 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Fewer COVID-19 in-patients in Chennai govt. hospitals now||COVID-19 in-patient numbers are down to fewer than 50 in each of the major government hospitals in the city. From a time when hospitals ran short of beds for patients in need of oxygen during the peak of the second COVID-19 wave, the number of patients admitted for treatment of COVID-19 has dropped drastically with the gradual fall in fresh cases over the past few months. Now, the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) has a total of 30 patients, who tested positive for COVID-19, and eight with suspected symptoms, who tested negative during admission. In fact, the hospital’s maximum COVID-19 in-patient census was 1,912 during the peak of the second wave of COVID-19. “Our in-patient numbers for COVID-19 has been below 100 for nearly two months. Of the 30 in-patients, 17 are under room air and 13 on oxygen support,” said E. Theranirajan, dean of RGGGH. He added that of the in-patients, majority were unvaccinated. “We rarely see fully vaccinated persons admitted for treatment,” he said. The Government Stanley Medical College Hospital has 26 patients with COVID-19. R. Jayanthi, dean of the Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital, said there were 26 patients with COVID-19, apart from 15 who had tested negative and seven patients with severe acute respiratory infection at the hospital. ‘No surge in two months’ “There has been no increase in COVID-19 admissions in the last two months. We are having five to eight admissions per day. It is now observed that those who have received two doses of vaccines have a benign course even if hospitalised, while 95% of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and those requiring ventilator are persons who have not received even a single dose,” she said. Nine patients admitted in the ICU were unvaccinated, she pointed out. “Of the 48 in hospital now, 30 are unvaccinated, and three have received a single dose. The remaining 15 are vaccinated,” Dr. Jayanthi said. At the Government Kilpauk Medical College (KMC) Hospital, there were 12 patients with COVID-19 and 20 persons with suspected symptoms of COVID-19. “Our COVID-19 in-patient census has been below 100 since September 1. Most of them have mild to moderate symptoms, while we see some coming in at late stages of the disease. Most of the persons with moderate to severe disease are unvaccinated and have co-morbidities such as diabetes and hypertension,” said R. Shanthimalar, KMC dean. The hospital has slowly reduced the number of beds allocated for COVID-19 due to the increase in non-COVID-19 cases, she added. Only the stand-alone 750-bedded COVID-19 hospital, the Government Corona Hospital in Guindy, has 130 patients. K. Narayanasamy, hospital director, said most of the admissions were referrals from neighbouring districts and other parts of the State, including Salem and Dindigul. Dr. Jayanthi added that despite the low admission figures, there was no room for complacency. “We cannot let our guards down because the census is negligible. We definitely need people to follow all COVID-19 protocols and get vaccinated,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fewer-covid-19-in-patients-in-citys-govt-hospitals-now/article37714708.ece
27 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Look at non-medico legal deaths for organ transplant’||With a steep drop in road traffic deaths due to consecutive lockdowns induced by COVID-19, the need to look at non-medico-legal deaths for organ donation has arisen, say organ transplant specialists. R. Kanthimathi, member secretary, Transplant Authority of Tamil Nadu, who participated in an event organised by MGM Healthcare to commemorate the 12th Indian Organ Donation Day on Friday, lauded the hospital’s effort in performing transplants even during the pandemic. November 27 is celebrated as Organ Donation Day. Dr. Kanthimathi said deaths due to road traffic accidents (RTA)’ had fallen by 54% and this has resulted a drop in transplants. Currently, non-medico legal deaths account for less than 2% of the transplants, she said, calling for more awareness programmes. In its first year of functioning, the hospital had performed six kidney transplants, 10 liver transplants and 45 heart and lung transplants each. “In the second year, we have successfully achieved 29 kidney transplants, 29 liver transplants, 53 heart and lung transplants each. We are also looking to kick-start corneal transplants at the earliest,” said J. Amalorpavanathan, head, transplant process and senior consultant at department of vascular surgery.. K.R. Balakrishnan, director of Cardiac Sciences, said the successful transplant on a patient having COVID-19, was published in the international medical journal Lancet . Suresh Rao, co-director of the Institute of Heart and Lung Transplant and Mechanical Circulatory Support, signed the pledge to encourage organ donation.  On the occasion, the transplant surgeons also recalled the donors’ altruistic sacrifice and the recipients’ gratitude for the donation. Those who participated at the event included Thiagarajan Srinivasan, senior consultant and director, Institute of Liver Diseases, Transplant and HPB surgery; Georgie Abraham, senior consultant, Department of Nephrology; Chandrasekaran Venkataraman, director and clinical lead, Institute of Renal Sciences and Kidney Transplant and Sudharsan SB, consultant at the department of Urology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/look-at-non-medico-legal-deaths-for-organ-transplant/article37714734.ece

27 November 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Efforts on to retain top slot in IT space: Stalin||Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Friday said efforts were on to ensure that Tamil Nadu retained the number one position in the IT space. Inaugurating the 20th edition of CII Connect 2021, an international conference and exhibition on information and communication technology (ICT), he said most developments in Tamil Nadu, particularly in the area of information technology, happened during the time of former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, who was instrumental in creating the basic infrastructure during his tenure. He said in 1996, a separate department was created, along with an IT task force, which made possible the formation of the Rs. 340-crore TIDEL Park in Taramani on the IT corridor. Tamil Nadu is gaining importance in India in terms of manufacturing software and exporting electronic items to several countries, he said. IT Minister T. Mano Thangaraj said the State was working on schemes and policies to ensure holistic development in the IT and ITES sector. The government has taken measures to digitise all offices in the Secretariat, focusing on e-Assembly, paperless Assembly, inclusive e-library, centers of excellence in the realm of artificial intelligence, blockchain and cloud computing. Minister for Finance and Human Resources Palanivel Thiaga Rajan said the Finance Department would go 100% digital. There is a need for cross reference of data on the schemes that can benefit people from all walks of life, providing proper information that can reduce the workload of officials in government departments. The Minister recalled his recent visit to the IIT-Research Park and lauded the ecosystem there. IT secretary Neeraj Mittal said the State had already churned out Unicorns like Zoho and Freshworks. “Start-ups, powered by information technology, will significantly contribute to GDP and jobs,” he said. During the event, an MoU was exchanged between TNeGA and the Chennai Mathematical Institute. Connect was organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), in partnership with the Tamil Nadu Government, the Electronics Corporation of Tamil Nadu, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, the Union Government and the Software Technology Parks of India.

Sakkarapani’s announcement in Delhi that the DMK Government would soon open 500 ‘Kalaignar Unavagams’, AIADMK coordinator O. Panneerselvam on Friday said it was an act of political vendatta, aimed at blacking out ‘Amma Unavagams’. The canteens should continue to be called ‘Amma Unavagams’, he said. “The idea of setting up canteens to provide subsidised food to the poor and the downtrodden was the brainchild of Amma [late AIADMK leader Jayalalithaa]. So the people expect the scheme to continue to function under the name ‘Amma Unavagams’,” he said. “The move to name the scheme ‘Kalaignar Unavagam’, instead of expanding the ‘Amma Unavagam’ scheme, under the same name, has a political motive,” he said. The AIADMK coordinator condemned the Minister’s announcement, and urged the Chief Minister to intervene in the issue and continue to call such canteens as ‘Amma Unavagams’, should the government open any more of them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/panneerselvam-opposes-kalaignar-unavagams/article37714706.ece

27 November 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Corporation to spend Rs. 3.50 crore to rebuild Ganapathy waste transit station||Coimbatore Corporation will soon start work to rebuild the waste transit station on Sathyamangalam Road in Ganapathy. According to sources, the Corporation would spend Rs. 3.50 crore on rebuilding the plant. It would utilise money from the Rs. 11 crore the Chief Minister said the State Government would give the Corporation, said sources. The Corporation had to close down the Ganapathy transit station to facilitate the construction of the Gandhipuram flyover by the Highways Department. At the time of closure, the plant was handling 125 tonnes waste a day. Following the closure, the Corporation had to divert the waste handled at the station to two other stations and this led to delay in transporting the waste and additional expenditure on fuel. And, rebuilding the plant, whose area was reduced, ran into problems because neither the Corporation nor the waste management contractor could come to a decision on who would fund the construction. The contractor, Coimbatore Integrated Waste Management Company Pvt. Ltd, had argued that it had invested money on building the plant. It was for a State Government project that the plant was shut and area reduced. Therefore it was the Corporation’s responsibility to fund the reconstruction. Now, the Corporation had decided to rebuild the plant to bring it back to use, the sources said. Of the Rs. 11 crore that the Chief Minister had promised, the Corporation would spend Rs. 4.45 crore for buying 500 bins and five compactors and Rs. 3.25 crore for incinerators. Sources said the Corporation buying 500 bins would help improve waste collection in a segregated fashion and transport the collected waste to any of the transit stations and from there to Vellalore. Of the 2,300-odd bins in the city, several were damaged, which affected transportation, the sources explained. The sources also said that though the Chief Minister had announced Rs. 11 crore for improving waste collection and transportation in the city, the fund was from the Central Government. The Government had sanctioned the funds under the 15th Central Finance Commission grant to be used for improving waste collection in the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corporation-to-spend-rs-350-crore-to-rebuild-ganapathy-waste-transit-station/article37714753.ece
27 November 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Tiruppur garment manufacturers demand steps to control yarn prices||Several garment manufacturers shut operations for a day on Friday demanding measures by the government to control yarn and cotton prices. A large number of manufacturers also participated in a hunger strike. President of Tirupur Exporters and Manufacturers Association Muthurathinam said the yarn price was Rs. 210 a kg in January this year and Rs. 350 a kg now. “MSME units are unable to fulfil the orders they have taken,” he said. A garment exporter needed 90 days to ship an order. If there were price hikes during the three-month period, the exporter would suffer losses. The prices were revised frequently, he said. China, Bangladesh, and Vietnam were competing countries and buyers would look at different if the prices offered by Indian exporters were not competitive, he said. In the case of manufacturers supplying to the domestic market, the GST hike announced by the government from January would be an additional burden. ‘Ban export of yarn’ He said the government should ban export of cotton and yarn and the Cotton Corporation of India should supply cotton only to the actual users. “We have also asked for formation of a knitwear board and the State government should have an organisation similar to the Cotton Corporation to source cotton and supply to textile units in Tamil Nadu,” he said. Domestic manufacturers said they supported the strike fully as they were unable to meet the high cost of raw materials. The garment unit workers also participated in the strike. Raja Shanmugham, president of Tiruppur Exporters Association, which supported the strike, said cost of dyes and chemicals had increased 40 % in the last one year and prices of corrugated boxes were up 30 % to 40 %. Yarn prices jumped 55 % in the last 12 months. “There are price challenges. The exporters should also demand higher prices from the buyers,” he said. K.E. Raghunathan, convenor of Consortium of Indian Associations, said exporters faced multiple issues such as high freight costs, lack of adequate RODTEP schemes and delay in receipt of refunds of input taxes. “The hands which feed others are now on hunger strike to convey their insecurity in life,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tiruppur-garment-manufacturers-demand-steps-to-control-yarn-prices/article37714744.ece

The prices will fall in the coming days as arrivals are increasing. The farmers at the wholesale markets have been asked not to sell to other States and bring more to the uzhavar sandhais. Wholesale traders said though farmers in the district have suffered crop loss due to rain, tomato arrivals from other States - mainly Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh - have increased. The wholesale prices crossed Rs. 100 a kg last week and are almost 50 % less now. “If there were five vehicles that were bringing tomatoes to Coimbatore a day last week, it is 10 now,” said a trader.

27 November 2021||CUDDALORE,TAMIL NADU||Weekly-off system for police personnel in Cuddalore||The Cuddalore district police have introduced weekly-off system for the personnel to ensure a healthy work-life balance and enable them to function more efficiently. The new system came into effect on Friday. Police personnel from the level of Grade II Constables to Head Constables would be given a day off every week. Though a system of a day off was already in force, police personnel attached to various wings, invariably ended up working on all days, owing to a shortage of manpower. The personnel were paid Extra Time Remuneration (ETR) of Rs. 250 per day for this. The new weekly-off system has been introduced on the directions of Director-General of Police C. Sylendra Babu, according to police sources. According to a senior police officer, “We have started the weekly-off system from today. A day off would be given in a week to all police constables and head constables. The system would be implemented in 46 Law and Order police stations, four All Women Police Stations (AWPS), four Prohibition Enforcement Wing (PEW), Special Branch and all special units in the district.” Station House Officers will discuss with the personnel their preferred day for the weekly-off. The police personnel will be allowed to take their day off to plan their personal work accordingly. The Station House Officers will ensure that the personnel avail their weekly-offs in a manner that does not affect the regular proceedings of the police stations concerned. The system will be implemented on a rotational basis unless there is a major law and order situation or a grave emergency within the jurisdictional limits of the stations concerned. This initiative is primarily to ensure the physical and mental health of the personnel, the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/weekly-off-system-for-police-personnel-in-cuddalore/article37715200.ece

27 November 2021||Dindigul,TAMIL NADU||Groundnut cultivation gets a boost with Central fund||With Central fund available to the tune of Rs. 45.08 lakh, farmers in Dindigul district were suggested to raise groundnut crop. Presiding over the monthly farmers’ grievance redressal meeting here on Friday, Collector S. Visakan said that the State government had announced disbursal of crop loans to all eligible farmers. Those who repaid within the stipulated term could also avail interest waiver. The farmers can approach the technical cell, at the Collectorate, which has a format in hand. For instance, if a farmer wanted to borrow money to raise paddy or any other crop, the loan size, repayment schedule and among other things were readily available. Likewise, for fish cultivation and purchase of buffaloes too, the loan component was ready. By approaching the 197 PACBs and societies with valid documents and bank account details, the farmers could get the sanction in no time for the 2021-22, Mr Visakan said and added that for any clarification or complaints, they can approach the office of the Joint Director (Agriculture) and assured prompt action on genuine cases. During the meeting, when some farmers raised issues regarding water distribution for irrigation and which affected the harvest, the Collector suggested that they go for alternative crops. Instead of sticking to one single crop, they may switch to produce which requires less water. Ultimately, the farmers had to make profit and not end up with a loss. Hence, crops, which required less water and continued to fetch high yield can also be attempted. The officials said that for groundnut cultivation, the Central government had earmarked Rs. 45.08 lakh for Dindigul district, which the farmers may utilise by way of incentives. Additional Collector S Dinesh Kumar, DRO V Latha, Joint Director S Pandidurai and other officials participated. Later, the Collector and others went around an exhibition in which features about growing new varieties of crops and other highlights were on display.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/groundnut-cultivation-gets-a-boost-with-central-fund/article37714844.ece

Speaking at the grievance meeting here on Friday, he said that it had been planned to disburse crop loans by organising special camps at block levels from Monday onwards and urged the farmers to approach officials. The State government had made arrangements to sell fertilizer through designated dealers and PACBs. He said that the discharge was heavy in the Vaigai. Hence, he urged the farmers and the public to ensure that cattle and milch animals were safe. When farmers voiced concern about the need to drain water in standing crops, he directed the officials concerned to take necessary steps. With copious water flowing into tanks, there would not be any problem in release of water for irrigation. While the farmers said that there was huge crop loss due to the rainfall, officials maintained that the loss could be only to an extent of less than 50 hectares. As there was a drop in arrival of tomatoes last week, the price crossed Rs. 100 a kg. The government stepped in and procured tomatoes from other States to bring down the rate. The Horticulture Department selected women and gave push-carts to sell tomatoes at a price fixed by the officials on a daily basis. “We will fix it at Rs. 50 or even less depending on the arrival...” an officer said and added that tomatoes were being sold at Rs. 70 a kg in private retail stores.

27 November 2021||PERAMBALUR,TAMIL NADU||Onion farmers flag under-utilisation of processing centre at Chettikulam||Onion farmers in Perambalur district have sought efficient utilisation of the Common Food Processing Incubation Centre (CFPIC) launched during 2017 in Chettikulam village for producing value-added products of shallots such as onion powder, onion paste, vacuum-packed peeled onion and onion flakes, with extended shelf life ranging from one to six months. The machinery installed at the centre by Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology (IIFPT), Thanjavur, has been grossly under-utilised due to issues such as gaps in round-the-clock power supply and shortcomings in marketing of the processed products, according to Shanmugam, an onion cultivator. The processing centre was attuned to ‘Mission Onion Programme,’ a concept to double farmers’ income by 2022, by the IIFPT, which functions under the Ministry of Food Processing Industries. With the Small Onion Stem and Root Cutter, Small Onion Peeler, and Solar Assisted Curing cum Storage Unit for Onions, a small quantity of shallots were initially processed every day into peeled onions, flakes and powder, for supply to a leading restaurant for its soup channel, and a Chennai-based entity supplying peeled onions to residents in apartments. After grading, the large-sized onions are peeled for vacuum packing and the smaller ones are converted into flakes and powder. Since the start of the centre, 44 tonnes of shallots and 15 tonnes of garlic have been processed. The centre has a capacity to process 300 kg shallots per hour, and there were possibilities for scaling up the production multifold with the available machinery, according to official sources. During September, Collector P. Sri Venkada Priya discussed with officials of Horticulture Department and Department of Agricultural Marketing and Agricultural Business the ways to optimise the utility of the processing centre. Shelf-life Every year, 70,000 tonnes of small onion is produced in over 8,000 hectares of land area. “At times when the procurement price falls below Rs. 20 per kg, farmers in the region suffer huge losses due to lack of post-harvest handling facilities. The peeled onion will last for one month under refrigeration, and shelf life of onion powder and onion flakes is six months. Onion paste lasts for five months. “We have secured three-phase power supply for the processing centre and are in a position to scale up the output of processed shallots to about four to five tonnes a day. Having organised a few buyer-seller meets, we have also identified traders for procuring and marketing the processed products,” Singaram, Deputy Director, Department of Agricultural Marketing and Agri Business, said. “The tenders for operating the centre lapsed last month. We have called for a fresh tender,” Mr. Singaram said.  Can serve better It was set up to produce onion powder, paste, vacuum-packed peeled onion and flakes It has a capacity to process 300 kg shallots per hour, and it can be scaled up Only 44 tonnes of shallots and 15 tonnes of garlic have been processed till date||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/onion-farmers-flag-under-utilisation-of-processing-centre-at-chettikulam/article37714875.ece

27 November 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Decks being cleared for private universities in Puducherry||The government has started clearing the decks for setting up private universities in Puducherry. The Cabinet meeting, chaired by Chief Minister N. Rangasamy on Thursday night, held a detailed discussion on bringing a legislation enabling the government to provide clearance for setting up private universities. “A detailed discussion was held at the Cabinet meeting. Once the cabinet decision gets its approval from the Lt. Governor, a Bill will be introduced in the next Assembly session paving way for establishing private universities in the Union Territory,” a highly-placed source told The Hindu. It is a long drawn process, he said, adding even after the legislation gets the Assembly nod, it has to be placed before the Centre for Presidential assent. In another significant development, the Cabinet decided to set up a Higher Education Council to promote and coordinate higher education, the source said. The Cabinet also decided to take back 50 acres of land given to Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research for establishing a super speciality multi-organ transplant centre at Sederapet. In 2019, the then Congress government decided to provide 50 acres to JIPMER from the 303 hectares of land acquired in 2006 for setting up a special economic zone in the revenue districts of Sederapet and Karasur. The economic zone project did not take off and the land remained idle. In the Thursday’s Cabinet meeting, the government decided to take back the land as no work for the hospital had taken place in the last two years. The Chief Minister at the meeting, according to the source, said if JIPMER was keen on the multi-speciality hospital project, government was willing to give around 55 acres of land belonging to the now defunct Anglo French Textiles in Pattanur. The land is close to JIPMER also, the source said. According to the source, the government wanted the 50 acres of land at Sederapet to be vested with Pondicherry Industrial Promotion Development and Investment Corporation Limited. The land could be utilised for industrial activity, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/discussion-begins-on-pvt-varsities/article37714735.ece

Governor to recommend a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation into the circumstances which led the Agriculture department to function in support of a particular private sugar mill in Tamil Nadu. Election wing secretary of the party and former legislator Vayyapuri Manikandan in a statement on Friday said the sugar mills in Puducherry were closed and farmers were forced to sell their products to a private mill at Nellikuppam in Cuddalore. "The farmers who are not willing to send their produce to the mill in Tamil Nadu are not allowed to harvest their crop by the department," he said. The sugarcane farmers are facing hardship due to the closure of mills in the Union Territory, he said urging the Lt. Governor to order a probe into the decision of the Agriculture department to direct farmers to sell their produce to a private mill.

27 November 2021||Sivaganga,TAMIL NADU||Insufficient funds, says MP||The Union government by giving paltry sums to beneficiaries to construct their own dwellings had made people living below the poverty line suffer, said Congress MP Karthi Chidambaram here on Thursday. Speaking to reporters, he said that the Centre and State governments put together gave a sum of Rs. 2.40 lakh to each of the beneficiary selected under the PM Housing Scheme. However, this money was insufficient. Hence, the beneficiaries had to borrow further. “We had raised this issue in Parliament, but the Centre does not seem to be listening,” he charged. The MP was at the Collector’s office to participate in the District Development Council meeting in which elected representatives A. Tamilarasi and Mangudi from Sivaganga district were present. The MP further said that the Prime Minister’s announcement to withdraw the three farm laws was not due to any change in his mindset, but he had apprehended severe defeat in the ensuing Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. Saluting the farmers for their unity, he said their grit had made the Centre bow. When asked to comment on BJP leader Subramanian Swamy’s tweet on overall failure of the Modi government including on the security front, Mr. Karthi Chidambaram said, “when you feed milk to a poisonous snake, you will realise the consequences.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/insufficient-funds-says-congress-mp/article37714773.ece

The demonstration was led by State president of Agricultural Wing G.K. Nagaraj. The party members rode a bullock cart and raised slogans condemning the State government. Mr. Nagaraj said that the Union government recently reduced the excise duties on petrol and diesel by Rs. 5 and Rs. 10 per litre respectively and it was up to the State government to reduce fuel prices further. “One litre of diesel costs Rs. 83 in Puducherry, but the same costs Rs. 92 in Tamil Nadu,” he alleged. The reduction in petrol prices alone is not sufficient, Mr. Nagaraj said, urging the DMK government to fulfil its poll promise of reducing fuel prices. The BJP will organise a larger agitation in Tiruchi in December led by State president K. Annamalai if the State government does not take steps immediately to reduce fuel prices, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bjp-stages-protest-against-state-govt-over-fuel-price/article37714761.ece

Chinnadurai, secretary, Thiruvonam Taluk Farmers’ Welfare Association, sporting green colour towels on their heads squatted on the floor in front of the podium seeking immediate redressal of their grievance after presenting a memorandum to the Collector.

They withdrew their demonstration after the Collector assured them that special loan melas would be held at these societies next week to redress their grievance. Issues such as non-availability of fertilizers and demand for increased flood relief and input compensation assistance dominated the meeting as several farmers pleaded with the State government to come to their rescue like the previous AIADMK government did last year when heavy rains affected agriculture operations during the ‘samba’ season last year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tiruvonum-farmers-stage-protest/article37714827.ece

27 November 2021||Thoothukudi,TAMIL NADU||Residents raise a stink over sewage mixing with rainwater||Even though no downpour was reported here on Friday, residents of the city are facing a horrific experience owing to stagnant rainwater mixing with sewage at several places, damaged roads and improperly desilted drainage channels. The extremely heavy rainfall that battered Thoothukudi on Thursday left most of the areas underwater. Places like Bryant Nagar, Tooveypuram, Anna Nagar, Kurinji Nagar, Dhanasekaran Nagar, Rahmath Nagar, Muthammal Colony, Rajiv Nagar, Kathirvel Nagar, Pushpa Nagar, Kokkur, Athi Parasakthi Nagar and several streets in Velankanni Nagar near Krishnarajapuram were badly hit with rainwater mixed with sewage stagnating there. While the Corporation pumped out water in some of these places, residents of places like Velankanni Nagar were waiting for the operation to start. Collector K. Senthil Raj said 275 pumps and 39 earthmovers had been deployed across the district to clear stagnant water. In the Corporation area, 237 motors had been installed and two earthmovers deployed. Since rainwater entered the ground floor and the generator room of the Thoothukudi Medical College Hospital, Minister for Social Welfare P. Geetha Jeevan, Dr. Senthil Raj and Corporation Commissioner T. Charusree visited the site on Friday to expedite pumping out of the water via VVD Signal area and Tiruchendur Road. With rainwater stagnating at the main entrance of the hospital, the gate at Rajaji Park has been opened for access. “Three standby generators have been kept ready at the hospital,” said Dr. Senthil Raj. In the 16 relief camps set up across the district, 639 persons had been provided with basic facilities, he said. Thoothukudi MP Kanimozhi, Minister for Fisheries Anita R. Radhakrishnan, Dr. Senthil Raj and Superintendent of Police S. Jayakumar visited rain-hit areas like Therkku Authoor, Thanneer Pandal, Nagakannigapuram, Kadambakulam, Kombuthurai, Varandiyavel, Kayalpattinam, Kurumbur and Tiruchendur and handed over relief materials to the people at relief camps. The prime reason for the rain-related woes of Thoothukudi is the Corporation’s failure to properly desilt Puckle Channel that drains sewage and rainwater into the sea. Consequently, Thevar Colony, Pasumpon Nagar, Netaji Nagar, P&T Colony and the adjoining areas were marooned. Water stagnated in all the areas situated on both sides of the 5-km-long drainage channel. After the sand and the waste deposited in the estuary at Terespuram were cleared, the stagnant rainwater was drained into Puckle Channel. Normalcy returned in Subramaniaswamy Temple in Tiruchendur on Friday as the rainwater drained. However, rainwater is still stagnating in low-lying areas in Kayalpattinam, which received 30 cm of rainfall on Thursday. Municipal officials are pumping out the water. As there is no check-dam to store surplus water released from Srivaikundam check dam, 20,710 cusecs of water was flowing into the sea at 4 p.m. on Friday. As water released from Kadambakulam near Kurumbur submerged the low-level bridge at Varandiyavel near Authoor, Thoothukudi– Tiruchendur vehicular traffic via this point was snapped, and vehicles were diverted from Arumuganeri Salt Pan Corner. Following IMD’s ‘Red Alert’ to Thoothukudi for Saturday and Sunday, Dr. Senthil Raj declared holiday for schools and colleges on Saturday. Rainfall recorded in the district was (in mm): Kayalpattinam 306, Thoothukudi 266, Tiruchendur 248, Srivaikundam 179, Kulasekarapattinam 158, Vaippar 149, Ottapidaaram and Sattankulam 121 each, Kadambur 90, Maniyachi 87, Vedanatham 80, Ettaiyapuram 78, Kovilpatti 71, Keezha Arasadi 59, Kayathar 58, Soorangudi 56, Kadalkudi 52, Vilathikulam 41 and Kazhugumalai 36.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/thoothukudi-reels-under-water-stagnation/article37714848.ece

27 November 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Overflow from Thuraiyur Big Tank inundates residential areas||The Thuraiyur Big Tank was filled to the brim and began overflowing on Friday, causing inundation in nearby residential areas of the tank. The sprawling tank spread over 284 acres is fed by inlet canals from Kolli hills overflowed for the first time in 16 years. When the water overflows from the tank, it goes into Chinna Eri near Thuraiyur bus stand through supply channels. However, the force of the water was such that the size of the supply channel was not sufficient and it flowed into the residential areas on either side. Water was around five feet high early on Friday morning but slowly receded to about knee-depth. Speaking to The Hindu , L. Sundari, who lives in South Teppakulam Street, said that she was woken up by the sound of gushing waters at around 3 a.m. When she ran to the window, she saw that her street was inundated, with water up to the window of a car. “Water from the supply channel overflowed and found its way into our streets and into the already full Teppakulam. The Teppakulam then overflowed into a nearby private school and residential areas,” the woman said. Water rushed into the houses next to the supply channel with the residents being rudely awakened by water gushing into their houses in the small hours of Friday morning. One such house was that of Mangala Isai Moorthy, a thavil player. “My thavil became soaked in the water and is now unfit to be used. My livelihood was hit by the COVID-19 lockdown and things were just starting to look up with the Margazhi coming up. Now I have no instrument and therefore no means to earn a living,” the man rued. Sandbags placed Officials of the Thuraiyur municipality had lined up sandbags to restrict the flow of water into the village later in the day. Collector S. Sivarasu visited the affected areas and directed the officials to inspect Sithambur, Sellipalayam, Varadarajapuram, Sengattupatti, Keerambur lakes and its adjoining residential areas and fields. He instructed them to carry out rescue measures and to survey the damaged crops.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/thuraiyur-tank-overflows/article37714832.ece

Both the kharif and rabi seasons have been affected. The roots of the standing thaladi/samba crops are rotting due to repeated inundation and this will severely affect the yield,” said S. Thambusamy, district president, Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam, Tiruvarur. Echoing similar views, V. Jeevakumar, district vice-president, said this was the third round of inundation of crops in the delta. He urged the authorities to take steps to drain the water quickly using earthmovers.

27 November 2021||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||Tamirabharani swells as discharge from dams goes up||Even as 709 of the 1,200 irrigation tanks in the district are overflowing, thanks to the recent downpour, Tamirabharani experienced heavy flow on Friday following discharge of over 25,000 cusecs of water from Papanasam and Servalar dams. Speaking to reporters after visiting the flood control room at the Collectorate, Collector V. Vishnu said the widespread rain that lashed the district on Thursday had ensured good influx of water into these dams, which were about to overflow while Manimuthar dam had 63% water (3,363 mcft against its maximum capacity of 5,511 mcft). Though 25,000 cusecs of water was discharged in the Tamirabharani from Papanasam and Servalar dams and another 2,000 cusecs of water was released in Chittar from Gadana dam, the perennial river, having the capacity of carrying 60,000 cusecs, swelled in the morning. As influx into the dams dipped following mild drizzle in the catchment areas, discharge of water from the dams also dwindled to 12,000 cusecs. “Though there is no flood threat in the Tamirabharani now, people should stay away from the river and the watercourse,” Mr. Vishnu said. The Collector also said 709 of the 1,200 irrigation tanks in the district were overflowing while 74 tanks had 75% water. Teams comprising officials from the Departments of Revenue, Public Works and Rural Development had been deployed to monitor the storage level in the irrigation tanks. Besides, the police were also closely watching the tanks so as to take immediate and coordinated steps to plug breaches, if any. “So far, the officials have plugged good number of breaches in the irrigation tanks including 12 breaches on Thursday night alone in Nanguneri block. Along with the monitoring teams, we’ve kept ready sandbags and the heavy earth movers to plug the breaches, if any, and hence there is no need for panic,” said Mr. Vishnu adding that 90 SDRF personnel had been kept ready in the district. The Collector said water stagnation complaints were being attended to immediately and 120 persons from marooned areas had been shifted to relief centres at Pappankulam, Melakallur, Kunnaththur and St. Antony’s Church, Palayamkottai. A community kitchen had been established to feed the people at the camps. Child dies The Collector said a three-year-old girl died when a house collapsed at Keezhapathai near Kalakkad in the small hours of Friday. Due compensation and other relief would be given to the affected family. When asked if there would be holiday for schools and the colleges in the district as Indian Meteorological Department had issued ‘red alert’ for the district for two more days, Mr. Vishnu said a final decision would be taken based on the situation on Saturday morning. He also informed that the joint damage assessment by the officials would start once the situation improved. Rainfall recorded in the district was as follows (in mm): Palayamkottai 107, Manimuthar dam 94, Cheranmahadevi 84, Papanasam 81, Ambasamudram 79, Tirunelveli 76, Nanguneri 64 and Radhapuram 54||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamirabharani-swells-as-discharge-from-dams-goes-up/article37714750.ece
27 November 2021||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||Speaker visits rain-hit areas around Panagudi||Speaker M. Appavu visited the rain-affected areas around Panagudi on Friday. As Hanuman river experienced floods on Thursday, rainwater entered residential areas around Panagudi causing extensive damage to roads, bridges and the crops besides entering a few residential areas. As the low-lying bridges near Kumanthankulam and Saithammalpuram suffered extensive damage, Mr. Appavu visited the spots. Since the flood snapped vehicular traffic between Kumanthankulam and Panagudi, Mr. Appavu had to cross the submerged low-lying bridge on foot to meet the affected villagers. He distributed grocery items sufficient for a month to 60 families of Kumanthaankulam. As a portion of the house of Lakshmanan of Raghunathapuram collapsed due to the rain, the Speaker handed over assistance to him. Mr. Appavu promised the villagers that the low-level bridges would be reconstructed as elevated bridges so as to ensure uninterrupted vehicular traffic to Kumanthankulam and Saithammalpuram. Families which had lost their houses in the downpour would get permanent houses. “Though Radhapuram region is being blessed with abundant rainfall after several years and all the irrigation tanks are now having decent storage of water, the rain-related problems the people are facing will be addressed very soon,” Mr. Appavu said. When residents of Samathuvapuram at Valliyoor told him that most of the houses in the hamlet were badly damaged, Mr. Appavu inspected the houses and assured the residents that appropriate action would be taken to repair the houses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/speaker-visits-rain-hit-areas-around-panagudi/article37714854.ece

According to R. Kumar, district secretary of Tamil Nadu Farmers’ Association, the location of the meeting was changed to a smaller room on Friday, which could not accommodate the members of various associations. He further alleged that District Collector S. Vineeth had not participated in two consecutive meetings held on Friday and in October. “We want to place our demands directly to the Collector,” he said. Issues such as distribution of water in the Parambikulam-Aliyar Project and shortage of fertilizers in Tiruppur district require immediate redressal, Mr. Kumar said. Along with the CPI(M)-affiliated Tamil Nadu Farmers’ Association, few other unions such as Tamil Nadu Farmers’ Association (Non-affiliated) and Tamil Nadu Farmers’ Protection Association staged a demonstration.

When the matter came up on Friday, Mr. Shunmugasundaram said the case had become infructuous since the commission had wound up its proceedings and submitted a report. Now, it was for the government to take the proceedings forward. However, it was argued on behalf of Mr. Surappa that the very initiation of the inquiry was wrong and the court must decide its validity. When the former Vice-Chancellor’s academic and other credentials were highlighted to underscore that he had enjoyed an impeccable track record, the Advocate-General intervened to state: “Let us not glorify him. There is a finding given by a former judge of this court and those findings are based on evidence.” After hearing both sides and finding that the Government was not inclined to drop the proceedings, the judge directed the Government to produce a copy of the report and file a detailed counter-affidavit by December 15. In his affidavit, Mr. Surappa had said he undertook major development work after assuming charge in April 2018. However, his opposition to the then government’s decision to pass all engineering students without conducting examinations for the “arrears” papers on account of COVID-19 and his efforts to obtain the Institute of Eminence status to the university had triggered a controversy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lapses-occurred-under-surappa/article37714707.ece

27 November 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||‘Affluent castes undergoing religious conversion is a matter of concern’||Sri Ram Sene founder Pramod Mutalik has said that most Christian institutions in the country are indulging in conversion by force or fraud. “These Christian pastors and fathers should conduct their prayers in their churches silently. Instead of that, they are making attempts at conversion. If this does not stop immediately, we will catch them and take action against them,’’ he told journalists in Vijayapura on Thursday. “Earlier, only the illiterate and poor were undergoing conversion. But now, Brahmins, Lingayat, Kurubas, Nayaks and other affluent castes are getting converted. This is a matter of great concern,’’ he said. “Christian missionaries have used conversion to create Nagaland and Gorkhaland. If they are allowed to continue, they will convert India into a Christian land,’’ he said. According to him, religious conversion is anti-national. “The State Government should pass the anti-conversion Bill before it is too late,’’ he said. He said that some corrupt BJP leaders are in the government and they are only interested in power. “They are misusing the support given by pro-Hindutva organisations. That is why such organisations have become weaker. That is also why the atrocities on Hindus are continuing and no one seems concerned about issues like conversion,’’ he said. He asked religious leaders to take to the streets to stop attempts at conversion. “They should leave their maths and ashrams and go to the villages and towns, visit the houses of common people and stop conversion attempts. Sadly, most heads of maths are indulging in politics,’’ he said. He said that most mosques are violating the Supreme Court orders on the use of loud speakers. He gave an ultimatum to the State Government to stop such violations immediately. “If not, the Sri Ram Sene members will sit in dharna in front of the offices of Deputy Commissioners in the districts and in Bengaluru,’’ he said. He said that it was distressing to learn about the ill-gotten wealth of some government officers who were raided by the Anti Corruption Bureau. “Such corrupt officers should be made to face the law,’’ he said. “However, it is not enough that corrupt officers are caught. The criminal politicians who are behind such officers should also be arrested,’’ he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/affluent-castes-undergoing-religious-conversion-is-a-matter-of-concern/article37714888.ece

It would decide the future of the Gokak clan in district politics and that it was the only chance to counter the rising clout of Lingayat leadership in northern Karnataka. It was also pointed out that the family was under the impression that the BJP leadership was not extending enough support to Ramesh Jarkiholi, after his resignation as a Minister,” a source close to the family said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/lakhan-stays-in-the-fray/article37714685.ece

27 November 2021||Belagavi/Hassan,KARNATAKA||Council polls: Lingayats, Vokkaligas dominate the contest||Candidate selection by all the three major parties for the elections to 25 seats of the Legislative Council shows an overwhelmingly presence of Lingayats and Vokkaligas, the two politically dominant castes in Karnataka. The two communities together account for over 60% of the ticket issued by the parties while only one Scheduled Caste (SC) candidate and two Scheduled Tribe (ST) candidates are in the fray. If Lingayats have dominated the political narrative in the Krishna basin in north Karnataka, Vokkaligas have remained dominant in the Cauvery basin in the south Karnataka region. Candidate selection by the ruling BJP, and the Opposition Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) shows this pattern. In Cauvery basin With the predominantly Vokkaliga vote base, the JD(S) has restricted its electoral battle to the Cauvery basin districts by announcing candidates for six seats, the Congress and the BJP have fielded candidates in 20 seats each. Both the BJP and the Congress have fielded only one candidate each in the five dual-member constituencies of Mysuru, Hubballi–Dharwad, Dakshina Kannada, Belagavi, and Vijaypura–Bagalkot. An analysis of the total of 46 candidates fielded by the three parties has shown the lion’s share in allotment of the ticket to candidates from Lingayat and Vokkaliga comunities. Across parties, as many as 16 candidates are Vokkaligas and 14 are Lingayats, cornering 65.21%. Individually, 34.78% are Vokkaligas while 30.43% are Lingayats. In all, there are nine OBCs (19.56%) and two Muslim and ST candidates each (4.34%) fielded by these parties. There is only on one SC candidate (2.17%). “The main reason behind this is lack of reservation for the deprived classes in the Upper House of the legislature unlike in the Lower House,” said Vaijanath Suryavanshi, Dalit ideologue and the founding member of Dalit Shoshit Samaj Sangharsha Samiti. The Upper House in Uttar Pradesh has such provisions. Muniswamy Gopinath, BSP general secretary, said, “We will start an agitation in Karnataka for similar provisions.” In northern parts In north Karnataka region (including Uttara Kannada) where the BJP is contesting in eight seats, seven have gone to Lingayats, which shows the community’s clout in the party that has been banking on Lingayat votes. The lone non-Lingayat contesting from the BJP in north Karnataka is Ganapati Ulvekar from Uttara Kannada, an OBC. In southern Karnataka (including Dakshin Kannada and Udupi), Vokkaligas have grabbed a bigger share across all parties. The BJP has fielded six Vokkaligas in the community heartland, and two Lingayats. It has given the ticket to two OBCs, and one each from Arya Vysya and Kodava comminites for the other four seats. Congress ticket distribution is slightly more even here. In the 12 seats the Congress is contesting, five Vokkaligas have been given the ticket along with four OBCs and one candidate each of SC, ST, and Muslim communities. The predominantly Vokkaliga-backed party, the JD(S) has chosen Vokkaliga candidates to contest in five of the six seats it is contesting. It has also given the ticket to an ST candidate. Reservation issue “Some people argue that the Constitution does not have provisions for caste-based representation in the Upper House. But in a welfare state, political parties can give ticket to members of deprived communities and ensure that the dominant castes are not over-represented,”said Rohit Latur, a constitutional lawyer and labour rights activist.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/council-polls-lingayats-vokkaligas-dominate-the-contest/article37714683.ece
27 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||CCB unearths loan fraud scam||Sleuths from the Central Crime Branch (CCB) police have busted a network of at least 52 companies registered in benami names, allegedly by Chinese nationals who were fleecing customers after giving loans on mobile applications without any guarantees. Acting on a tip-off, CCB Economic Offences Wing raided the offices of Licorise Technology Pvt. Ltd. in Munnekolala recently. The company was allegedly issuing short-term loans on various mobile applications like Cash Master and Crazy Rupees, and charging a hefty processing fee that was almost half of the loan granted. Those who availed of the loans were later charged a hefty weekly interest. When debtors failed to pay up, the company would harass them by making threatening calls and sending details of the default and other information to contacts on their mobile phones that they would have gained access to while giving out loans on the app, said the CCB. Similar cases had been reported in Telangana in 2020, where several debtors had reportedly ended their lives. Two similar cases were busted in Bengaluru too. The recent raid revealed that there was a network of 52 companies registered in the names of most of the employees working at Licorise Technology Pvt Ltd, without their knowledge. “The employees were given incentives to open an ‘account’ in their name, to which many willingly volunteered. But unknown to them, companies were registered in their names which in turn were indulging in illegal loan grant and recovery. A maze of firms registered in various benami names have been created to ensure the real owner, Chinese nationals, are hidden,” said a senior police official, involved with the probe. These companies have had tie-ups with RBI registered Non Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) for loan disbursal. “The companies do not even offer loans. They are only a middleman. They get loans granted from NBFCs, cheat the customers charging almost 50% as processing fee and later charge hefty weekly interest, barred by law. Thus on the loan principal provided by Indian NBFCs, the debtors are also cheated, harassed for recovery and the windfall is transferred out of the country to China,” the official said. CCB will now write to the Enforcement Directorate, Income Tax Department, Department of Goods and Services Tax, Reserve Bank of India and Register of Companies, for further investigations. The Central Crime Branch has arrested Licorise Techonology’s HR Manager Kamaraj More, 25 and Team Leader Darshan Chavan, 21 for making threatening calls to debtors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ccb-unearths-loan-fraud-scam/article37714641.ece
27 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BBMP starts drive to clear 714 encroachments on storm-water drains||Following Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai’s directions, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has taken up the drive to remove encroachments on storm-water drains. It has identified 714 drains for removal. Civic chief Gaurav Gupta said priority was being given to ensuring free flow of water in all the vulnerable areas. “Removal of encroachments is a regular exercise. We have already taken up the drive in many places across the city, especially in the vulnerable points,” he said. Following a survey, in December 2020, the civic body had stated that of 2,626 encroachments, only 714 remained, while there were 52 cases being heard in the court. In 2016-17, 428 encroachments had been removed, while in 2018-19, a total of 1,484 had been cleared. These included agricultural land, vacant sites, residential and commercial buildings, and roads.However, following the pandemic, the encroachment clearing drive had all but stopped. 2016 survey The previous survey report in August 2016 showed that in 139 villages in and around the city, the storm water drain network had been encroached to an extent of 326.16 acres and 1,570 encroachments had been identified. Of these, 356 were residential buildings, 35 commercial buildings, 935 vacant sites or agricultural lands and 244 roads. In both these reports, the maximum encroachment was identified in Mahadevapura zone. Of 1,570, 761 were in Mahadevapura zone in 2016. As per the latest report, of 714, there were 184 in Mahadevapura zone. The least number of encroachments have been identified (as per the latest report) in Koramangala valley (3) and Rajarajeshwarinagar zone (9). In the high-powered meeting held recently in the BBMP, it is said that the Chief Minister took the officials of the stormwater drains department to task for failing to provide details of works taken up, number of encroachments cleared and cases pending in court. The Chief Minister has also directed the civic body to clear encroachments by big developers and builders without mercy, but given some time to those belonging to lower socio-economic groups to make alternate arrangements. Mr. Gupta reiterated that there was no impediment from the court for encroachment removal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bbmp-starts-drive-to-clear-714-encroachments-on-storm-water-drains/article37714624.ece
27 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Rigorous screening of arrivals from 3 countries||Taking note of multiple cases of a new COVID-19 variant B.1.1.529 in South Africa, Botswana and Hong Kong, Karnataka has mandated rigorous screening and testing of international arrivals from these three countries. South Africa has reported six cases of the new variant and Botswana three while Hong Kong has one case. This variant has a significantly high number of mutations, which is a matter of concern. In a circular issued in Bengaluru on Friday, T.K. Anil Kumar, Principal Secretary (Health and Family Welfare), has reiterated the importance of meticulous implementation and rigorous monitoring of the three-pronged surveillance strategy. This includes screening and testing international travellers and their contacts, routine sentinel surveillance and surge surveillance, and timely sending of RT-PCR positive samples to designated INSACOG Genome Sequencing Laboratories (lGSLs). “Botswana, South Africa and Hong Kong are already in the list of at-risk countries for international travellers coming to India. It is, therefore, imperative that all international travellers coming from and transiting through Botswana, South Africa and Hong Kong, and also including all other at-risk countries identified by the Centre, are subjected to rigorous screening and testing as per guidelines,” the circular stated. “The contacts of these international travellers should also be closely tracked and tested as per the guidelines. It should also be ensured that the samples of such international travellers testing positive for COVID-I9 should be sent to designated IGSLs for genome sequencing, and these samples should be sequenced on priority at IGSLs,” according to the circular. All district administrations have been strictly instructed to adhere to the overarching ‘Test-Track Treat-Vaccinate’ principle to ensure stringent implementation of containment measures, and to prevent the spread of Variants of Concern (VoC) or Variants of lnterest (Vol), according to the circular.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rigorous-screening-of-arrivals-from-3-countries/article37714630.ece
27 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||New president announces panel to redraw KSP bylaws, opposed||Dr. Mahesh Joshi took charge as the President of Kannada Sahitya Parishat on Friday and announced he will form a committee led by a retired judge to holistically “review and rewrite” the bye-laws of the Parishat. “We will take a report in three months to reshape the Parishat in such a way it can be taken to the people,” Dr. Joshi said. Coming amidst concerns from a section of writers that Dr. Joshi was supported by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the announcement has stirred a hornet’s nest. “Wanting to change the by-laws of the Parishat immediately after getting elected, is exactly like how the BJP after coming to power talks of changing the constitution,” senior writer K. Marulasiddappa said. He had also written two open letters in the run up to the Parishat polls condemning the introduction of “party politics” in Parishat polls. Dr. Joshi, however, said he had promised to “review and rewrite” the by-laws in his manifesto and he was not overstepping his brief. “We will open the committee for public suggestions and it will be done in a very transparent manner,” he said. “For instance, we want to start a membership drive aiming for one crore members, for which we need to halve the membership fee to Rs. 250 and allow membership, payment of fee on a mobile app. We need to amend the by-laws to make room for these measures. The by-laws are a century old and are in a crying need to be rewritten,” he said. Another senior writer S. G. Siddaramaiah appealed to all the newly elected district presidents to stand up to the state president and ensure the by-laws are not rewritten. “The previous president Manu Baligar increased the term of the president to five years from three years, after getting elected for a term of three years. Now Dr. Joshi seems to be wanting to rewrite the entire by-laws. Just because someone wins an election, they should not be allowed to rewrite the by-laws. It will only lead to institution capture. We will resist this tooth and nail,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/new-president-announces-panel-to-redraw-ksp-bylaws-opposed/article37714653.ece
27 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Paediatricians see a rise in demand for flu shots||Karnataka has recorded as many as 35,083 COVID-19 infections and 33 deaths among children aged 0-9 years since June 24 when the decline of the second wave began. According to data from the State COVID-19 War Room, as many as 84,061 children aged 10-19 have tested positive and 52 have succumbed to the disease from June 24 till November 25. The corresponding numbers in these age groups from March 8, 2020, till March 8, 2021, were 27,646 infections and 28 deaths and 64,677 infections and 46 deaths, respectively. From March 9, 2021 till June 23, 2021, as many as 58,818 child infections and 34 deaths in the 0-9 years group and 1,50,111 infections and 42 deaths in the 10-19 years group were reported. Anxious parents Paediatric experts said although COVID-19 infections in children have reduced in the last six months compared to the previous quarter, they are seeing an increase in the number of anxious parents getting their children to hospitals for flu shots, especially after reopening of schools. Srikanta J.T., consultant - Paediatric Interventional Pulmonology and Sleep Medicine at Aster CMI Hospital, who is part of the high-level expert committee set up by the State Government to analyse, advise and control the third wave of COVID-19, said flu shots offer a possible advantage of ‘viral interference’ that prevents children from developing severe infections from COVID-19. Similar symptoms “While most symptoms of COVID-19 and flu are similar, influenza has higher mortality when compared to COVID-19, i.e. 1% vs 0.1 % respectively (100 times higher) which makes vaccination against flu extremely critical during the current scenario,” he said. Yogesh Kumar Gupta, consultant - Paediatrics at Fortis Hospitals, Bannerghatta Road, said flu shots have gained importance during the pandemic. “Parents think that taking flu shots may protect their children. It does give protection, but it does not mean the child will not get COVID-19. However, if a child has taken a flu shot and gets COVID-19, the severity is less and if the child gets flu and COVID-19 together, the severity will be high,” he said. Gururaj Biradar, consultant - Pediatrics, PICU and Neonatology at Manipal Hospital, Whitefield, said flu shots reduce the risk of infection by 40-60% in vaccinated children and are 90% effective in reducing flu related complications and deaths. “With a rise in paediatric flu cases during the winter, there is an increase in the number of parents bringing their children for flu shots,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/paediatricians-see-a-rise-in-demand-for-flu-shots/article37714628.ece
27 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Nod for change of land use must even after conversion of farmland for other purposes’||Interpreting the laws on land conversion and change of land use in areas covered under master plans of the local planning authorities across the State, the High Court of Karnataka has declared that permission for change of land use under the Karnataka Town and Country Planning (KTCP) Act, 1961, is mandatory even after conversion of agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes under the Karnataka Land Revenue (KLR) Act, 1964. “Grant of conversion from agriculture to non-agricultural purposes by the Deputy Commissioner under Section 95 of the KLR Act will not mean that change of land use under Section 14A of the KTCP Act is granted, deemed to be granted or automatically granted, if the land still vests with the planning authority and comes within the master plan,” the court said while interpreting provisions of both the Acts. Justice M. Nagaprasanna delivered the verdict on a petition filed by the Karnataka Rajya Mandavya Gruha Nirmana Sahakara Sangha, Mandya. The petitioner had questioned refusal of Mandya Urban Development Authority to approve plan for the petitioner’s housing layout in the absence of permission for change of land use after conversion of land purchased by the petitioner for the formation of layout. As the provisions of the KTCP Act having overriding effect on all other laws, what would unmistakably emerge is that one has to seek change of land use under Section 14A of the KTCP Act from the planning authorities if the areas come under the master plan declared by such planning authorities, the court said. The court also clarified that requirement of permission for change of land useunder the KTCP Act is essential only if the land, after being ordered to be converted for non-agricultural purposes by the Deputy Commissioner, falls within the master plan of the planning authority. As the provisions of the KTCP Act are intertwined with a singular object of concurrence of the planning authority, importance of the zoning regulations and the master plan that is drawn, the court said the permission for change of land use is essential to ensure that development of land is as per the master plan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/nod-for-change-of-land-use-must-even-after-conversion-of-farmland-for-other-purposes/article37714678.ece
27 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Tender floated for Mallige corridor of suburban rail project||The Rail Infrastructure Development Company (Karnataka) Limited (K-RIDE) has floated a tender for civil works on the Baiyappanahalli- Chikkabanavara stretch or Mallige corridor of the suburban rail network. The total length of the network is 25 km with 14 stations on the alignment. The authorities estimate that once completed, it will benefit 2.03 lakh people. The tender, which has been floated over a year after the project was approved, does not include the construction of stations. K -RIDE Managing Director Amit Garg said that they are also consulting with other agencies for the finalisation of station designs for which a tender will be floated at a later stage. “We had multiple discussions on station planning and going into detail on the design. There is a need to integrate the stations with the other modes of transport.” In October 2020, the Central Government had approved the suburban rail project that has four corridors covering a distance of 148 kms with 57 stations. The other three corridors identified are KSR Bengaluru to Whitefield, Heelaige to Rajankunte and Kengeri to Whitefield. As per the plan, K-RIDE has plans to integrate the proposed stations with metro or existing railways stations at various points such as Majestic, Kengeri, Cantonment, Lottegollahalli, Chikkabanavara and others. On floating the tender for civil works, rail activist Mr Sanjeev Dyamannavar said, “It has floated the tender one year after the project was approved. The agency should expedite the project by floating tenders to other crucial corridors such as the city to Devanahalli that links Kempegowda International Airport. Unlike the metro, K-RIDE does not require a major chunk of private land for the project. However, it should be made sure that all available land from Railways or from the state government is available prior to taking civil works.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/tender-floated-for-mallige-corridor-of-suburban-rail-project/article37714647.ece
27 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Security tightened at Murudeshwar temple||Home Minister Araga Jnanedra on Friday said security had been tightened at Murudeshwar temple in Uttara Kannada district after ‘Voice of Hind’, an online magazine said to be pro-Islamic State (IS), published a morphed image of Shiva idol there and threatened to destroy it. Bhatkal BJP MLA Sunil Naik submitted a petition to the Home Minister urging him to provide security to the temple and the idol. He also demanded arrest of all those involved in an online propaganda against the temple, located about 10 km from Bhatkal. The photo has been edited to replace the head of the idol with an image of an IS flag, the MLA said. The MLA said anti-social elements had been trying to disturb communal harmony and peace in the town and urged the Minister to take steps to maintain peace by strengthening the security at the temple. A large number of pilgrims visit the temple, he said. Mr. Jnanendra informed the MLA that police security had been provided to the temple and asked the Uttara Kannada police to coordinate with the cybercrime section to identify the source of the photograph. Speaking to The Hindu , Praveen Sood, DG&IGP, Karnataka, said they had launched a probe into the origins of the morphed image, said to be in circulation on various social media platforms earlier as well. Interestingly, the issue of the pro-IS online magazine, which carries the image, does not speak about India in the story, but focuses on the recent Dhaka riots. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has till date arrested three persons — Abdullah Basith, 26, from Hyderabad, and a Kashmiri couple, Jahanzaib Sami, 36, and Hina Bashir Beigh, 39 — all alleged operatives of Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/security-tightened-at-murudeshwar-temple/article37714680.ece
27 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Rally held in support of Hamsalekha||A group of people took out a rally on Friday in solidarity with music composer-lyricist Hamsalekha, against whom a case has been registered for allegedly “hurting sentiments of the Brahmin community”. The protestors brought meat dishes and had a shared meal at Freedom Park as a symbolic gesture. It was held by “Samvidhana Samrakshana Samiti”, a coalition of dalit and progressive organisations on the occasion of Constitution Day. Hamsalekha, at a programme in Mysuru, had said that while ‘upper’ caste person visiting a Dalit’s house was celebrated such as in the case of the late Pejawar Vishveshwara Teertha, the important question was if it would also work in the reverse. He had also rhetorically asked if such visitors would partake the food consumed by Dalits during the visits. Though Hamsalekha apologised for his remarks after they were seen as criticism of the seer, who was trying to overcome the caste barrier, Basavanagudi Police registered a case against him and questioned him on Thursday. There were protests both against and in favour of Hamsalekha outside the police station. Food culture “Eating meat is our food culture and we will not accept any attacks on that, decrying it as inferior,” said L. N. Mukundraj, one of the organisers of the protest. The protest comes in the wake of a week-long campaign on social media. Senior writer S. G. Siddaramaiah, condemning the ‘upper’ caste reaction to Hamsalekha’s remarks, wished Basavanna be the model for all ‘upper’ castes in the State. “Basavanna rebelled against the tyranny of the inhuman varnashrama hierarchy. Basava’s philosophy is what has guided the State and I hope will guide us in the future too,” he said. Minister for Fisheries, Ports and Inland Transport Angara S. came to the protest venue and took the memorandum on behalf of the government. The protesters demanded cases against actor Chetan and Hamsalekha, for allegedly “hurting sentiments of the Brahmin community” , must be immediately withdrawn. “Both cases have been registered in Basavanagudi Police Station though the comments were not made in the limits. The division is headed by members of the same community and is unfairly targeting those critical of the community. We want officials from the division transferred,” Mr. Mukundraj demanded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rally-held-in-support-of-hamsalekha/article37714620.ece
27 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||VB Bakery employees’ strike on wage issue enters third day||The staff of VB Bakery in Vishweshwarapuram struck work for the third day on Friday over delays in wages and non-payment of dues, PF and ESI. Though employees went on strike on Wednesday, the bakery was open for business for two days. However, three outlets in the city were forced to close down on Friday afternoon as they ran out of stock of baked goods. At the time of going to press, the management had yet to reach out to the employees’ union for talks. One of the striking employees and leader of the union, Rajesh, told The Hindu that wages had been irregular even before the pandemic struck. He claimed there had been no hikes in salaries for four years. “The company, though, has been deducting PF and ESI contributions from the employees, which has not been remitted into our accounts for years now. Of the 80 employees, 40 were nearing or over 50 years of age and were forced to retire. The management has not settled the accounts of any of them. Five of them have since passed away,” he said. Vishweshwarapuram Brahmins’ (VB) Bakery was started in 1953 by Thirumalachar from Hassan at Sajjan Rao Circle. Before the pandemic, the management had expanded to ten outlets, but subsequent losses forced it to shut many of them. Now there are only three outlets, sources said. D.A. Vijay Bhaskar, general secretary, All India Trade Union Congress, who is supporting the strike, said earlier the management used to credit the employees’ union account with Rs. 30,000 every day, from which salaries were paid. “The management discontinued the arrangement before the pandemic, claiming they would pay staff their salaries themselves. However, that has not been the case,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vb-bakery-employees-strike-on-wage-issue-enters-third-day/article37714625.ece

All 12 students of Spurthy College in Marasur, are above 18 years of age, and are first year B.Sc. (Nursing) students, who live in the college hostel, said district health officials. The source of the infection has been traced to three students who went to a supermarket in Anekal. District health officers said they had developed symptoms, but tested negative on RAT. However, before the RT-PCR test results arrived, they went to their respective home towns. This is the second time a cluster has been detected in this college. At the time, 11 students had tested positive and the source of infection had been traced to those with travel history to Kerala. All staff members have been fully vaccinated. Steps are now being taken to test the remaining students and primary contacts, said G.A. Srinivas, Bengaluru Urban District Health Officer. As on Friday evening, 350 students have been tested.

Ravi Kumar on Friday wrote to additional secretaries and principal secretaries of departments to conduct scrutiny and a detailed inquiry wherever irregularities are noticed in tendering of works. In his letter to the heads of departments, Mr. Ravi Kumar said Mr. Bommai had instructed to conduct inquiry on complaints of irregularities noticed in the tendering process and payment of bills above Rs. 10 crore after he assumed office. On July 4, the Karnataka State Contractors’ Association had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi alleging that contractors in the State were forced to pay a bribe of up to 40% of the project cost to government officers and elected representatives to get their dues cleared in departments such as Public Works, Major and Minor Irrigation, and Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Engineering, and the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike. The Chief Secretary cited, in his order, a letter from Mr. Bommai which stated that scrutiny should be conducted into major works undertaken and stressed the need for time-bound clearances and approvals of contracts to ensure transparency. The Chief Minister’s letter to the CS also said that a system should be created by which electronic submission of bills are made directly by the executive engineer to the accounts section which automatically generates bill number.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/chief-secretary-writes-to-depts-on-probe-into-tenders/article37714681.ece
27 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Schools continue to face severe teacher shortage||Some private schools are combining different sections, and teaching over a hundred students in one class, as they struggle to cope with inadequate teaching staff strength. With this, physical distancing has taken a backseat. The shortage was felt acutely once physical classes resumed for students across all sections. Many teachers — who quit their jobs during the pandemic after managements slashed their salaries or were unable to pay when parents couldn’t afford school fees — found employment opportunities as private tutors or changed job sectors. Lokesh Talikatte, State unit president, Recognised Unaided Private Schools’ Association, Karnataka, acknowledged that there was a “severe” shortage of teachers. "Currently, I have 180 teachers for the six schools that I run. But we need another 20 more teachers, at the very least. Many of the teachers who worked in my school but quit their jobs have taken to other professions that pay better salaries,” he said. Mr. Talikatte has started looking for teachers from other States. “This week I interviewed teachers from Meghalaya and West Bengal.” Shalini S., whose daughter studies in a private school that follows the State-syllabus, said that when sections are combined, there are nearly a hundred students in one class. “Our child’s school is facing a shortage of English and Social Science teachers, so they have combined sections for these two subjects,” she said. Although parents have opposed this, school managements have asked them to wait for a short duration till they get new teachers. A principal of a private school said they are conducting classes in large auditoriums so that some physical distance can be maintained. T.V. Mohan, Chairman of Jubilee International Public School, said that due to shortage of teachers, they are running classes in two batches – morning and afternoon batches. “As a result of this, the workload of our existing teachers has increased. I have even put out advertisements and have got a very poor response,” he said. Mahalaxmi Chidanand, Principal of Oceans Elementary School, said that they are recruiting staff on a part-time basis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/schools-continue-to-face-severe-teacher-shortage/article37714636.ece

27 November 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Big Bubble model adopted as rising numbers cause panic||The sudden spurt in COVID-19 positive cases, that too on a medical college campus, has created panic among residents of the twin cities of Hubballi-Dharwad, forcing the district administration to initiate strict measures to contain the pandemic. According to Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad Nitesh Patil, to check further spread of the pandemic, the Big Bubble model has been adopted. Under the model, only those who test negative for COVID-19 will be sent out of campus so that the infection does not spread. However, what has caused anxiety among the authorities and also the college and hospital management is that those who participated in a cultural event at D. Veerendra Heggade Kalakshetra on the college campus, and who, later, tested positive, have gone out of campus and visited various places. What is a matter of concern for the authorities is that doctors and health staff who have tested positive have treated various patients who have already been discharged now. In addition, doctors of SDM Hospital also practice in various clinics and nursing homes of the twin cities and the number of patients treated by them in the last one week may be in hundreds. After the cultural function of students, various other functions too have been conducted in the hall. Alternative arrangements Now, that the SDM Hospital has been sealed down, the administration has made alternative arrangements for OPD and other services at KIMS Hospital in Hubballi and Civil Hospital in Dharwad. Additional beds and medicine have been supplied to these hospitals. Mr. Nitesh Patil also said that he has spoken to IMA office-bearers to extend assistance at government hospitals in the event of an increased inflow of patients. Holiday Meanwhile, following the outbreak, a holiday has been declared till Wednesday by several private schools in Dharwad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/big-bubble-model-adopted-as-rising-numbers-cause-panic/article37714889.ece

27 November 2021||Kalaburagi,KARNATAKA||Kalaburagi chapter of Karnataka State Scientific Research Council launched||Expressing concern over what he called increasing “superstitious” practices in society, Congress leader and former Deputy Chairman of the Legislative Council B.R. Patil has said that anti-superstition activities should begin from the Vidhana Soudha. “Ministers conduct Homa and Havana in their offices in the Vidhana Soudha. Some of them have even converted their offices into small temples. Every day, a priest comes and offers puja. Those in power who are supposed to inculcate awareness among people against ‘superstition’ have become proponents of ‘superstition’. Spreading awareness against ‘superstition’ and helping develop scientific temperament should, hence, start from Vidhana Soudha,” Mr. Patil said. He also expressed concern over Dalits and other innocent people from the lower strata of society increasingly becoming the victims of “superstition”. He was addressing a gathering after inaugurating the Kalaburagi chapter of the Karnataka State Scientific Research Council (KSSRC) in Kalaburagi on Thursday. Objectives Earlier, State Vice-president of KSSRC Vishwaradhya Satyampete gave a brief note on the organisation and its objectives. “Fighting superstition and helping develop scientific awareness among the people is the core objective of the organisation. There is a similar body in the State which is under the government. But, it is doing hardly anything to spread scientific temperament. Its inactivity compelled us to float another structure supported by people,” Mr. Satyampete said. State president of KSSRC Hulikal Nataraj demonstrated many tricks to expose what are often called miracles. Lingayat leader from the region Ravindra Shabadi presided over the event.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kalaburagi-chapter-of-karnataka-state-scientific-research-council-launched/article37714886.ece
27 November 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Hundreds of activists commemorate anniversary of farmers’ struggle||Hundreds of farmers and activists from different organisations blocked Kalaburagi-Devasugur National Highway 150 at Nandur village near Kalaburagi to commemorate the first anniversary of the historic farmers’ struggle on the Delhi border against the three farm laws enacted by the Union government. Vehicular movement was disrupted on the highway for an hour. The agitation was organised by Samyukta Horata – Karnataka, a conglomerate of different organisations and individuals. The agitation was a part of the nationwide pre-scheduled agitations which were successfully carried out even after the assurance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to repeal the controversial laws. The leaders of different organisations and the politicians who participated in the highway blockade agitation congratulated the farmers protesting on the Delhi border for forcing the Union government to announce the repeal of the ‘anti-farmer’ laws with their uncompromised and heroic agitation. “With their uncompromised and determined agitation, the farmers on the border of the national capital have defeated the Modi government. It is a big victory of the historic farmers’ movement. However, the Union government, which is hell-bent to serve its corporate masters, is still silent on other demands of the farmers which included bringing Minimum Support Price into legal framework and Electricity Act 2020 that paves way for the privatisation of power sector,” H.V. Diwakar, State Secretary of Raitha Krushi-Karmikara Sanghatane, said during the agitation. The activists demanded that the State Government headed by Basavaraj Bommai repeal the amendments made to Land Reforms Act and APMC Act which the farmers in the State had been opposing. Congress leader and former Deputy Chairman of Legislative Council B.R. Patil, Karnataka Prantha Raitha Sangha leader Sharanabasappa Mamshetty, All India Kisan Sabha leaders Maula Mulla and Bhimashankar Madyal, Raitha Krushi-Karmikara Sanghatane leader Mahesh S.B., Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha leaders Umapathi Malipatil and Nagendrappa Tambe and others participated in the agitation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hundreds-of-activists-commemorate-anniversary-of-farmers-struggle/article37714896.ece

27 November 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||IMA president urges government to provide free medical education||Khatiel Suresh Kudwa, president, Indian Medical Education, Karnataka Chapter, on Friday said the government should provide medical education for free so that everyone in society will get free or at least affordable healthcare facilities. Dr. Kudwa told reporters here the relationship between doctors and patients was worsening every passing day due to commercialisation of medical education. Free medical education on merit basis could address this issue, he said. The ‘family doctor’ system wherein the physician was completely aware of health issues of patients, was on the wane, he said urging the government to take steps to promote the system. Dr. Kudwa said the government spent more than the usual spend of 1.5% of the GDP on healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic. This should continue on a par with other countries wherein governments spend over 10% of their GDP on healthcare. IMA, Dr. Kudwa said was striving to restore doctor-patient relationships by forming a district council comprising senior IMA members that provides continuous learning for doctors, arranges free medical check-up and treatment camps and arranging public health awareness programmes. Dr. Kudwa said besides ensuring affordable healthcare, the government should check quacks to ensure a healthy society. There were 1.5 lakh estimated quacks in the country. Even after amendment to the Karnataka Private Doctors Regulation Act in 2017, the punishment for quacks was negligible, he said urging the government to ensure stringent action against such persons. IMA-Mangaluru president Satyamoorthy Aital, Secretary Sadananda Poojary, Treasurer G.K. Bhat, State Vice-President K.R.

27 November 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Farmers block highway in Mysuru, Mandya||Farmers belonging to various groups created road blockade at different places in the district on Friday in support of their demand for a legal backing for implementation of Minimum Support Price (MSP) by the Centre and withdrawal of the land reforms act and the APMC amendment act by the State. Nearly 100 farmers sat on a dharna at the intersection of the Outer Ring Road and the Mysuru-Nanjangud highway creating a traffic jam and throwing vehicular movement out of gear for nearly 3 hours from around 11 a.m. The farmers also herded their livestock which were stationed on the highway to effectively check the movement of vehicles. Subsequently the vehicles were diverted till the blockade was lifted at around 2 p.m. Another group of farmers assembled in large numbers and staged a similar demonstration near Srirangapatna. The demonstration and highway blockade was part of a nation-wide dharna called by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella organisation of various farmers’ groups to pressure the Centre to enact a law ensuring legal guarantee for the minimum support price (MSP) for agricultural produce. Farmers’ leader Kurubur Shanthakumar addressed the farmers and said the Centre and the State should wake up from their slumber having realised the strength and the unity of the farmers. He said Friday marked the completion of one year since the protest against the three contentious farm laws (now repealed) by the Centre. Now the demand is to seek a law to ensure legal guarantee for the MSP. Mr. Shanthakumar said farmers in Karnataka have also suffered crop loss due to excessive rains and the Government should fix a scientific method of assessing the loss and compensate the farmers. The price fixation by the NDRF and SDRF was nominal and did not cover the actual loss suffered by the farmers, he added. The State Government also came under flak for its land reforms act and the amendments to the APMC act, which, the farmers feared, would facilitate the entry of multinationals and corporates to determine the pricing and cropping pattern. Mr. Shanthakumar said farmers constituted 70 per cent of the country’s population and they were determined to safeguard their rights. The farmers under the aegis of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha and Hasiru Sene said all agricultural crops should be brought under the ambit of the MSP which, the KRRS said, should be conceived in a scientific manner. The impact of the highway blockade threw traffic out of gear as vehicles were stranded for a long time. Traffic on the Bengaluru-Mysuru highway was diverted at the Outer Ring Road-Columbia Asia Hospital junction towards the KRS-Road ORR junction. Similarly, vehicles were diverted to ply via Bannur and Malavalli to reach Bengaluru.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/farmers-block-highway-in-mysuru-mandya/article37715140.ece

Students who want hostel facilities soon after their admission will be accommodated in the university hostels until the SoE hostels are completed. UoM Special Officer Chethan H.K. said the University has proposed to start the operations of School of Engineering from December 15. “Finishing some minor pending works, we plan to keep the place ready as admissions for management seats have commenced,” he added.

Jhansi, a new sniffer dog, reached BRT Tiger Reserve on Thursday after completing seven months of rigorous training. The sniffer dog was trained at Chandigarh by the Indo-Tibetan Border Police and the exercise was supported by Traffic India, a division of WWF India, and works closely with various State Governments and agencies to study, monitor and curb wildlife trade which is illegal. Jhansi displayed its skills and its capacity to obey various commands in a brief demonstration. Forest guard Basavaraj and forest watcher Siddharamanna were trained to handle it. Senior officials in BRT said Jhansi will be attached to the Punjur range and will be further trained to detect wildlife cases. The tiger reserve is part of the Nagarahole-Bandipur-Wayanad-Mudumalai-Satyamangalam-BRT complex that has a contiguous forest cover spread over 12,134 sq km with an estimated tiger population ranging from 635 to 813, according to the National Tiger Conservation Authority authorities.

27 November 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||60% of funds allotted for coir sector unused||Around 60% of the funds allocated for the Skill Upgradation and Mahila Coir Yojana between 2014-15 and 2019-20 have been left unused by the Coir Board under the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, a Right to Information (RTI) query has revealed. The Skill Upgradation and Mahila Coir Yojana (MCY) was launched to foster entrepreneurship across the coir-producing States in the country. The MCY, in particular, aims at women empowerment through the provision of spinning equipment at subsidised rates after imparting appropriate skill development training. As per the information obtained by K. Govindan Nampoothiry, a Kochi-based RTI campaigner, from the Coir Board, a sum of Rs. 83.16 crore (Rs. 88.72 crore allotted in the Budget) was released for the scheme between 2014-15 and 2019-20, but the Coir Board had spent only Rs. 33.46 crore. Fund utilisation While Rs. 29.27 crore was allotted in 2014-15, only Rs. 8.58 crore was utilised. Though Rs. 21.67 crore was received in 2015-16, the utilisation stood at Rs. 4.55 crore. Of Rs. 15 crore sanctioned in 2016-17, the Coir Board could only spend Rs. 3.67 crore. In 2017-18 and 2018-19, a sum of Rs. 6.82 crore was released, while the fund utilisation stood at Rs. 9.8 crore. However, the spending dropped to Rs. 6.84 crore in 2019-20, during which it received Rs. 10.39 crore. The RTI document did not provide the details of allocation and utilisation of funds in 2020-21 and 2021-22. However, it noted that 50,151 people were trained under the Skill Development programme between 2014-15 and 2020-21. When contacted, an official with the Coir Board said that the pandemic had adversely impacted the implementation of the scheme in the last two years. The official, however, did not provide reasons for poor fund utilisation in the previous years. Need for awareness Mr. Nampoothiry said there was a need to create awareness on the scheme. “The MCY is a scheme exclusively for women artisans. Not many people know about the scheme. It is appalling that more than half of the funds sanctioned for the scheme remain unutilised,” he said. Besides, the new employment created in the coir industry in Kerala through schemes such as Coir Udyami Yojana (CUY) and Prime Minister's Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) dropped from 1,629 in 2017-18 to 514 in 2020-21, the RTI revealed.

According to officials from the Forest Department, the three female elephants – an adult, a sub-adult and a juvenile – were crossing the railway track near Navakkarai within the Madukkarai forest range around 9 p.m. on Friday. At this point in time, Train 12602 Chennai Mail, operated from Mangaluru to Chennai, hit the three elephants at a section that falls under the Palakkad Railway Division near Marappalam Thottam. The elephants died on the spot. District Forest Officer of Coimbatore Forest Division T.K. Ashok Kumar visited the spot. “The three elephants belonged to the same herd,” he said. Mr. Ashok Kumar said the Forest Department and the Palakkad Division of Southern Railway made arrangements to send the train with passengers back to Walayar. However, the loco pilots were detained for inquiry, he added. In March this year, a 25-year-old male elephant was severely injured after being hit by a train outside the reserve forest area of the Madukkarai forest range close to the inter-State border and later succumbed to the injuries.

27 November 2021||KALPETTA,KERALA||‘Check dams a death knell for rivers’||Rajendra Singh, water conservationist and Magsaysay award winner, has said that the check dams being constructed across rivers in the State would sound the death knell for the rivers. Interacting with a group of students and environmentalists in the district at a debate organised by the Pazhassi library at Mananthavady on Friday, Dr. Rajendra Singh said the construction of check dams across rivers in a State like Kerala, which experienced heavy rainfall, was unscientific. “Check dams are needed across rivers in States like Gujarat and Rajasthan as the rainfall is very low in those States,” Dr. Singh said, adding that the check dam across the Kabani and its tributaries were constructed without any scientific study. It would accelerate floods during the monsoon and cause changes in the direction of flow in many places. It was suspected that such constructions in the State were only for exploring the possibilities of defalcating public money, he said. Water storage Check dams should be constructed in places where the rivers or rivulets dried out in summer and such structures could help to store water in pores of sand and aquifers. Moreover, it would lead to a rise in the ground water table and help reduce evaporation loss while such constructions across perennial rivers would cause a rise in the evaporation loss, he said. 11,800 dams Dubbed the “Waterman of India,” Dr. Singh said his group “Tarun Bharat Sangh” had constructed 11,800 check dams across rivers in Rajasthan and the endeavour could restore 12 rivers. “We constructed three-times taller check dams in those rivers than the concrete check dams across the Kabani river without using concrete. Such constructions will not destroy nature,” Dr. Singh said, adding that such works with public participation was the need of the hour. Instead of constructing check dams across rivers in Kerala, the government should focus on ensuring free flow of water during summer with the support of the public, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/check-dams-a-death-knell-for-rivers/article37714953.ece

27 November 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Quick action to mend potholes||Facing flak for shoddy upkeep of roads to prevent potholes, the Public Works Department (PWD) is readying a plan to encourage contractors to procure mobile pothole-filling machines. “This is part of the efforts to do preventive maintenance, in keeping with the adage a stitch in time saves nine,” says an official. “Such a mobile unit procured by the PWD a few years ago is now lying in a dilapidated condition in Thiruvananthapuram for want of upkeep. It is best that such jobs are entrusted to contractors in each district. Under the plan, contractors will be encouraged to procure such units to attend to potholes to avoid procedural delays in road repairs.” “The PWD will train contractors on modern methods of road maintenance. This will lessen the time taken to restore roads and prevent potholes from becoming bigger when there is delay in patch work,” he says. Running contract “This will be apart from the one-year running contract system, which got administrative sanction recently. The contractor will thus have to do preventive maintenance and regular upkeep of the road that is handed over to him. Upkeep of drains and other road infra too will be covered in the running contract,” the official says. Roads which are fully resurfaced will continue to be covered under defect-liability period – the period for which the contractor who did the black-topping will have to maintain the road. Referring to Minister for Public Works P.A. Mohamed Riyas’s statement that the Kerala Water Authority would have to fully restore roads that it trenches for laying or repairing pipelines, PWD sources say the KWA and other agencies are hitherto given two options — they must fully restore the stretch or deposit money in advance, using which the PWD would execute the work. Fed up with complaints about the KWA, Kerala State Electricity Board, and others failing to adhere to the options, the PWD had decided to insist on the agency trenching a road to do the complete restoration work, they say.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/quick-action-to-mend-potholes/article37714988.ece
27 November 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Gender help desk flooded with cases||In what could be construed as a disturbing trend, Snehitha, the Kudumbashree’s round-the-clock gender help desk at Kakkanad, has logged over 200 domestic violence cases in three successive years since 2018-19. This assumes significance in the wake of the recent death of a young law student who allegedly took her life citing, among other things, domestic violence. The number stood at 230 during 2018-19, before dropping to 202 in the year thereafter and then rose to 221 in 2020-21. Though the number had dropped to 96 till October this year, Kudumbashree officials reminded that neither the rise nor drop in the number was a true reflection of the social evil, since it does not take into account cases reported via other avenues, including the District Women Protection Officer and the police. “A rise in cases is usually noticed whenever we conduct mass campaigns on our service. While lack of awareness does hamper the cases reaching us, the general reluctance of victims to hanker after the proceedings may also be prompting them to suffer in silence rather than report,” said Shine P. Money, District Programme Manager (Gender), Kudumbashree. Individual choices While the alleged apathy of the police in handling domestic violence cases has come into sharp focus, with the recent incident in which an Inspector stands suspended, the Kudumbashree authorities vouched that the police had been usually cooperative other than a few exceptions, which have more to do with the choices of the individual officers concerned. Limitations for police “The police seem to have obvious limitations in taking into custody a man accused of domestic violence while under the influence of alcohol, especially during nights. The complainant may also backtrack in the morning once he is sober,” said Mr. Money. Besides, victims of domestic violence are also found reluctant to lodge police complaints against their husbands. In may cases, Snehitha offers them temporary shelters even with their little children and influence them to lodge petitions. “We also get orders from the Women Protection Officer for the safe living of victims in their households and then get men violating those orders arrested,” said Mr. Money. Snehitha has two counsellors and five service providers who arrange for mediation, counselling, or legal aid in association with the District Legal Services Authority where the victims opt for divorce.

27 November 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||NSS petitions CM against survey||In line with its open objection to the methodology adopted for the socio-economic survey among forward communities in Kerala, the Nair Service Society (NSS) has sought the State Government’s intervention to terminate the proceedings. In a memorandum, the community organisation sought a direction in this regard from Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to the Kerala State Commission for Economically Backward Classes among Forward Communities (KSCEBCFC). Submitted by NSS general secretary G.Sukumaran Nair, it pointed out that the current methodology of the survey would cause the denial of due rights to the economically weaker sections among forward communities. According to the NSS, a study report submitted by A.V. Ramakrishna Pillai, former chairman of the KSCEBCFC, had recommended that socio, economic, and community surveys of each community should be done and the population of all communities should be recorded. Concerns raised “The commission, under the cover of this recommendation, is planning to conduct a sample survey by collecting details of just five families in a ward, which is unscientific. The sample survey is being done in clear violation of the commission’s recommendation, which also undermines the directive to carry out a census of all communities and a socio, economic, and community survey of each community. The sample survey will not bring out the real picture,” said Mr.Nair. “The rights of the forward communities will be denied when the survey is being carried out in haste without adequate preparation,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nss-petitions-cm-against-survey/article37714989.ece
27 November 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Footwear units in Kozhikode launch e-commerce portal||The majority of small entrepreneurs in the district’s famed footwear industry are gearing up to set foot into the world of new generation marketing with their own e-commerce portals and online marketing tools. About 30% of the small industrialists in the sector here are now the proud owners of their own customised e-commerce websites to cash in on the boom in online sales and put up a stiff competition to their established rivals enjoying a monopoly status. “The pandemic-induced crisis continues to be a life lesson for many to prepare better for business and think of newer sales strategies in the e-space. There are about 150 active footwear manufacturing units now in Kozhikode and Malappuram districts alone which are actively trying to explore the e-trading opportunities,” says M. Abdurahiman, one of the leading footwear manufacturers in Kozhikode and the district president of the Kerala State Small Industries’ Association. He said that digital sales teams and social media promoters were now part of the footwear units in Kozhikode and Malappuram districts to achieve new sales targets. The Footwear Manufacturers’ Association of Kerala (FooMA), one of the leading organisations in the sector, places Kozhikode as the hub of footwear manufacturing units in South India with the increasing number of new ventures and job opportunities. According to them, innovations take place in the sector and the increasing export potential also attracted many youngsters to the field. The realisation of the proposed footwear park at Feroke with a permanent exhibition hall and convention centre was also expected to help the business scale new heights, the association said. Owners of some of the leading Kozhikode-based footwear brands revealed that the willingness of large-scale retail companies to display the locally manufactured products in their multi-brand showrooms was a profitable business move and a sign of recognition for the local players in their efforts to come up with quality products and innovative designs. The increasing exports and the entry of many of the locally made products to the international markets in the Middle East countries also have prompted the multi-national retailers to give better consideration to the local manufacturers, they claimed. Figures available with the Department of Industries attest that there are over 25,000 persons directly associated with the footwear industrial units for a living in the State. There are also city-based companies engaged in the assembling and sales of machines used for the mechanised production of footwear. Entrepreneurs expressed the hope that the annual business turnover which stood now at Rs. 3,500 crore would touch a new heigh with the growth of digital sales.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/footwear-units-in-kozhikode-launch-e-commerce-portal/article37714961.ece

Thankappan has said that everyone in the local bodies ruled by the Congress will now be addressed “dear so-and-so” instead of ‘sir’ and ‘madam’. Inaugurating the Constitution Day celebrations organised by the Congress’ cultural wing Samskarika Sahithi here on Friday, Mr. Thankappan said the use of ‘dear’ would create an impression of camaraderie between the Government and the people. Boosting confidence “The people will consider themselves as endeared to the Government, and it will boost their confidence as well,” he said. Mr. Thankappan also inaugurated a letter-writing event in protest against the linguistic inequity being followed by the Government. He said all local bodies under the Congress rule would be instructed to shift to the new salutation mode. Recognition According to Mr. Thankappan, the salutation sir/madam creates a divide between the people and the Government. Replacing it with ‘dear’ will be the best way out to bridge that divide, he said. “'The beauty of the Constitution lies in identifying its citizens with their names, and it will be the biggest recognition a citizen can have,” he said. He pointed out letters used by people’s representatives, including the Prime Minister, Chief Minister, ministers, MPs and MLAs, were invariably using the salutation ‘dear so-and-so’ and not ‘sir/madam’. “That should be a model for us, and not what the colonial rulers left behind.” Samskarika Sahithi district chairman Boban Mattumantha presided over the function.

The farmers who went to meet District Collector Mrunmai Joshi after a protest march outside the Collectorate were disappointed as the Collector had been away attending a meeting convened by Speaker M.B. Rajesh at Pattambi. As none attended to the farmers, they staged a sit-in outside the Collector’s office, protesting against the failure of the authorities concerned in addressing the woes of the farmers who live in constant conflict with the wildlife. The farmers complained that the compensation of Rs. 5 lakh assured by the District Collector to the family of Mathai was yet to be given. “When the farmers staged a protest carrying the coffin of Mathai, the Collector had assured that the compensation would be given the next day. Two weeks have passed and no compensation has been given,” said Raymant Antony, district secretary, Kerala Karshaka Samrakshana Association (KKSA). Officials deputed Revenue officials deputed by Ms. Joshi spoke to the protesting farmers and assured them that the compensation would be released on Saturday. “After discussions with the Forest Department, they have assured us that the compensation would be released on Saturday,” said Mr. Antony who called for an end to the sit-in protest. Earlier, KKSA State chairman N.K. Sivaraman inaugurated the march taken out by the farmers to the Collectorate. The march was a part of a Statewide protest demanding Government action to end the increasing wildlife attack. The marchers demanded title deeds to landless farmers living in forest fringe areas. In 2005, the Government had ordered title deeds to 647 farmers who migrated before 1977. But the Revenue and Forest Departments took no action to implement the Government order. “The Forest Department is taking action against us for killing wild animals that threaten our lives,” said Mr. Sivaraman, adding that no political party had lent them support.

The Kerala Administrative Tribunal (KAT), Thiruvananthapuram, has issued notice to the Government on the alleged violation of the Kerala State and Subordinate Service Rules (KS&SSR). Acting on a plea by the College of Engineering, Thiruvananthapuram (CET), Principal Jiji C.V. to stay the proceedings, the tribunal sought information on the various contentions raised by the petitioner. The Higher Education Department pushed the technical education sector on the brink of a significant overhaul two weeks ago when it issued an order to reverse the “temporary promotions” of 18 faculty members and promote 43 others as principals and joint directors with retrospective effect. Besides Dr. Jiji, a few other notable faculties who had been downgraded from the cadre of principals included A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technological University (KTU) Vice Chancellor Rajasree M.S., Director of Technical Education Byjubai T.P., and Kerala Public Service Commission (PSC) member M.R. Baiju. In its order, KAT has sought response on the “non-compliance” with Rule 28(b) of Part II of the KS&SSR despite the specific instruction by the Kerala High Court. The court had ordered the Government to review the promotions that had been sanctioned after August 5, 2008 by preparing select lists in accordance with the provision of the rules. “However, the provision that mandated the constitution of a departmental promotion committee chaired by a PSC member was violated. A selection committee headed by an Additional Chief Secretary reviewed the promotions in this case. Moreover, Dr. Rajasree, whose promotion was also reviewed, was oddly made member of the panel,” Dr. Jiji said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/demoted-principals-challenge-order-in-kat/article37714971.ece

The civic body maintained that the system is a temporary one and steps for improving facilities had been initiated. A longer-term project of Rs. 4.2 crore was cleared by the council and would be implemented in a year. The Corporation also sought two days to take a call on the matter. The amici curiae report on the ABC facility, presented before the High Court on Friday, said the facility was ill-equipped to take care of the animals. It says the Corporation had not utilised the land available to meet even the basic needs of the centre. Also, the dogs are kept in inhuman and harsh conditions. As the cages are constructed with iron grills, the dogs are unable to even stand up because their feet would fall through the mesh. The report, presented by amici curiae S.Ramesh Babu and T.C. Suresh Menon, says some NGOs told them that the dogs were kept in a cramped condition in the cage before their visit. The animals were fed cooked food only recently. The data in the record books on the number of dogs sterilised did not tally with the data provided by the veterinarian. The authorities informed the amici curiae that three to five dogs out of 100 die. But none of these were subjected to postmortem. The operation theatres did not meet the requirements. The rack of medicines was almost empty.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/improve-facilities-at-abc-centre-hc-tells-corpn/article37715250.ece

In his order, Commission chairman K.V. Manoj Kumar instructed the Attingal Deputy Superintendent of Police (DySP) and Attingal station house officer (SHO) to register a case against Rejitha M.R., the grade civil police officer, who is currently posted under the Kollam District Crime Records Bureau (DCRB). She must be booked under Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, that pertains to punishment for cruelty to children, the order stated. The Commission has instructed the State Police Chief to evolve a comprehensive training programme to sensitise the police force on child rights and laws that guarantee their protection. Criticising the manner in which the officer handled the situation during which she had blamed the child and her father of stealing her mobile phone, the commission noted her transfer and instruction to undergo behavioural training course could only be viewed as routine disciplinary action. Such steps were inadequate while considering the mental agony suffered by the child, the panel felt. The order has come at a time when a petition filed by the child seeking action against the officer is being heard by the Kerala High Court. Having sought the State Police Chief the details of action taken in the issue, the case will next be heard on November 29.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/panel-orders-action-against-policewoman/article37715057.ece

Mohamed Riyas said those who dig up roads should also be responsible for repairing them. The Minister held other Government agencies, in particular the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) which cut roads for laying water supply pipelines, are also accountable for the situation. “Those who dig up roads should repair them. If the KWA is cutting roads for water supply needs, they should also be responsible for restoring the roads to their former state,” Mr. Riyas said adding the Public Works Department maintained only 33,000 km of the 1 lakh plus km of roads in the State. Matter to be discussed Meanwhile, Minister for Water Resources Roshy Augustine took a cautious approach to the issue. He said the Water Resources Department viewed Mr. Riyas’ remarks seriously. Mr. Augustine said he planned to discuss the matter with Mr. Riyas. In 2019, the KWA had issued a circular to field-level officers to strictly follow guidelines when digging up public roads to work on water supply pipelines. In January 2020, the PWD and the KWA decided to use the PRICE (project information and cost estimation) software, which is used for preparing project estimates and issuing online approvals, to ensure coordination and speedy disposal of applications.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pwd-alone-cant-be-blamed-for-bad-roads-says-riyas/article37715000.ece

The seven cities and the adjacent urban local bodies, all with a total population of above 10 lakh, will be provided total funds of Rs. 1,402 crore over the next five years, which has to be spent on improving service-level benchmarks, especially in sanitation and provision of clean drinking water. The seven chosen urban agglomerations are Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Kochi, Thrissur, Malappuram, Kozhikode and Kannur. Kochi will get the maximum share of Rs. 245 crore, while Kollam will get the least share of Rs. 128 crore. Though projects for revitalising water sources, rainwater harvesting, recycling of water, and waste management can be taken up, the funds will be provided only based on an evaluation as per Union Government’s guidelines. Waste processing In waste management, the first priority has to be to establish a system for collection and scientific processing of waste. The second priority is to promote alternate waste processing systems. Dump sites have to be sealed. At least three waterbodies of more than one acre area have to be revived. Projects for recycling and reuse of water, with a 200 million litres per day capacity plant for a population of 10-20 lakh, should be implemented. Water supply projects for uncovered areas have to be taken up. Each major urban local body (representing an urban agglomeration), the State Government, and the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs will have to enter into a tripartite memorandum of understanding, with the targets for each year. Progress evaluation The Ministry will constantly evaluate the progress in each of the sectors. The percentage of grants that the local bodies will get will depend upon the marks in these evaluations. The major urban local body in each agglomeration will serve as the nodal local body and will be receiving the funds on behalf of the region. A five-year plan has to be prepared for each urban agglomeration. A sub-committee will be formed under the District Planning Committee to coordinate the various activities. A joint planning committee will be formed for preparing the plan in each region. Committee A committee will be formed at the State level to monitor all the activities. Minister for Local Self-Governments M.V.

27 November 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Vegetable prices coming down||Vegetable prices have started coming down in the open market following market intervention by the Agriculture Department and the consequent increase in arrivals from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Tomato prices, which had touched Rs. 110-120 per kg in the open market this week, fell to around Rs. 70 on Friday, according to vendors in Thiruvananthapuram city. Prices of various other vegetables, which had shot up over the past two weeks, also have started falling, they said. Direct procurement of vegetables by the Kerala State Horticultural Products Development Corporation (Horticorp) from farmers in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka is a major reason for the dip in prices. Horticorp outlets sold tomato at Rs. 68 per kilo at its outlets in Thiruvananthapuram and Rs. 50 in Kozhikode on Friday, forcing traders to cut down their prices as well. “We expect a further reduction in the prices with more arrivals expected,” J. Sajeev, managing director, Horticorp, said. With vegetable prices soaring, the Agriculture Department had directed Horticorp to directly purchase vegetables from farmers outside the State. Under this initiative, vegetable consignments from Karnataka and Tamil Nadu started arriving on Thursday at depots in Kozhikode and Thiruvananthapuram. On Thursday, 41 tonnes of vegetables arrived from Mysuru and Tirunelveli. On Friday, 34.5 tonnes arrived from both places. More loads are expected on Saturday as well. Vegetable prices had shot up in the State following the heavy rainfall and consequent crop damage in southern States. With the increase in arrivals, prices of other vegetables also have dipped. On Friday in Thiruvananthapuram, Horticorp outlets sold bitter gourd for Rs. 60 per kg, beans at Rs. 63, and brinjal at Rs. 45. Prices are expected to come down further over the next few days.

The court, in the case pertaining to the 97th Constitutional amendment, noted that the cooperative sector is a State subject. The RBI statement also overlooks a Supreme Court ruling, in an income tax-related case, related to memberships in cooperative societies, he said. RBI statement (In its statement, the RBI cautioned the public against cooperative societies that use the words ‘bank’, ‘banker’ or ‘banking’ as part of their names. The RBI also noted that some cooperative societies were accepting deposits from non-members/nominal members/associate members, which is tantamount to conducting banking business in violation of the Banking Regulation Act.) Rural sector Mr. Vasavan pointed out that banking activities form only a part of Kerala’s service cooperative banks. They are more actively involved in the rural sector such as for issuing loans to farmers, supplying seeds, fertilizers and pesticides, and procurement and marketing of agricultural produce, the Minister added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rbi-regulation-govt-to-consult-legal-experts/article37714999.ece

This is a shame in a democratic country. Voices of dissidence have been silenced under the (Narendra) Modi Government. The way the BJP Government tried to suppress the farmers’ agitation is an example,” he said. The Sangh Parivar forces are injecting poison in the minds of people in the name of religion, community and even food. They want to divide people on communal lines.

He submitted a petition to the Home Minister urging him to provide security to the temple and the idol.

27 November 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Mild ‘tremors’ reported in Bengaluru||Citizens in several parts of the city, especially those living off Mysuru Road, reported a loud sound and mild tremors that caused window panes to rattle on Friday around noon. Amidst fears and speculation that it was an earthquake, the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) issued a statement ruling out seismic activity. None of the cell’s seismographs recorded any signatures. It is now suspected that the sound may have been caused by a ‘sonic boom’ — shock waves created when an object travels through the air faster than the speed of sound. However, neither the Indian Air Force (IAF) nor Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) have confirmed whether they were running any sorties on Friday. KSNDMC said it received reports between 11.50 a.m. -12.15 p.m. from residents in Kengeri, Hemmigepura, Jnanabharathi, Rajarajeshwari Nagar and Kaggalipura. Girish, a resident of Chandra Layout, said he heard a sound and the window panes rattled while he was in the kitchen. “But my wife who was on the terrace did not hear anything,” he said. A resident from R.R. Nagar, Madhukara, described it as a “large explosion-like sound” that shook the window panes in his house. “It lasted for just less than a minute,” he said. Sonic booms have been heard in the city several times in the past. In July 2021, residents in South and West Bengaluru had reported hearing an explosion-like sound around 12.30 p.m. At the time, too, the Bengaluru city police suspected that it was a sonic boom suspected to have been produced during a fighter plane sortie in the city, though the IAF denied conducting any such exercise at the time. The previous year, in May, when a sonic boom was heard, the IAF clarified that it had been caused by a test flight sortie.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/mild-tremors-reported-in-bengaluru/article37714353.ece
27 November 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Tomato price plays truant in Madanapalle||After going out of reach of consumers since the start of November, prices of tomato took a sudden dip from Rs. 100 a kg on November 16 to Rs. 40 a kg on Friday at the tomato market in Madanapalle, the largest in Asia. The prices are for the first and second-grade stocks. According to the market yard officials, the arrival of tomato stocks, which plummeted to below 100 tonnes a day in early November, has now picked up, reaching 349 tonnes on Friday. This has come as a breather to consumers all over Chittoor district. The tomato crop witnessed low yields in the western mandals, even as thousands of farmers waited to harvest the fresh crops, which generally commences from December. Following heavy rains, coupled with damage to rural roads, arrivals have been severely affected. Despite a tolerant market trend, what is worrying consumers in Chittoor and Tirupati divisions is that the vendors continue to sell third grade tomatoes between Rs. 80 and Rs. 100 a kg. “Though the quality is bad, we have no option but purchase it. Fine varieties are finding their way to supermarkets in Bengaluru and Chennai, leaving us with scrap-like produce in the domestic market,” said Munikrishna, a government teacher in Srikalahasti. A vendor at Nagari, Mukuntha, admitted that the consumers coming to vegetable markets in municipalities and semi-urban areas generally buy third-grade tomatoes. “Today (Friday), we were supplied with the third-grade stocks at Rs. 30 a kg. We can’t store the stock for more than two days. We are putting a price of Rs. 80 a kg. We will only get a slight profit, or end up with losses,” he said. Coupled with tomatoes, prices of other vegetables too skyrocketed. On Friday, ladies fingers was priced at Rs. 100 a kg, a small-sized cauliflower at Rs. 60 and cabbage at Rs. 80 a kg. Other vegetables such as brinjal, carrot and several gourds were priced at three times their price a few weeks ago. This scenario has led to vegetable markets in the district wearing a deserted look.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tomato-price-plays-truant-in-madanapalle/article37715157.ece

The survey was a multi-round project conducted in a representative sample of households. Disclosing the percentage of population deprived in the 12 parameters, the MPI pointed out that the deprivation parameter wise in 2019-20 was : nutrition - 31.10 per cent; child-adolescent mortality - 1.38; maternal health - 10.87; years of schooling - 15.84; school attendance - 2.10 and electricity - 0.4 per cent.

She accused the officer of speaking very rudely to her in front of her husband and father when they were summoned to the station in connection with a domestic violence complaint she had filed a month ago. Two separate internal inquiry reports were submitted on Mr. Sudheer. While Neeraj Kumar Gupta, Deputy Inspector General of Police, Ernakulam Range, submitted a report to the State Police Chief, Aluva Deputy Superintendent of Police P.K. Sivankutty gave another report to the District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural). The move to suspend the officer came just hours after Industries Minister P. Rajeeve visited the victim’s house at Edayapuram in Aluva and met her parents almost as an emissary of the Chief Minister. He put the victim’s father Dilshad on phone with the Chief Minister, who promised justice to the family and strict action against the officer. “The Government is with the victim’s family, and the guilty will not be protected. No compromise will be made in the pursuit of justice for the family. An inquiry is on against the officer, and actions will be taken in compliance with formalities,” Mr. Rajeeve said. Mr. Dilshad said the Chief Minister had given his number to contact him if he found any issues with the ongoing probe. “The Chief Minister clarified that the transfer of the officer to the police headquarters was part of formalities. We are fully satisfied with the ongoing probe and feel very relieved after the Chief Minister’s assurance,” he added. Meanwhile, the police are set to move court for the custody of Mohammed Suhail and his parents, Rukhiya and Yousuf, who were arrested under Indian Penal Code Sections 304B (dowry death), 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), 306 (abetment of suicide), and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention). They were remanded in judicial custody for 14 days on Thursday. Cong. calls off protest Meanwhile, the Congress called off its protest in front of the Aluva East police station demanding the suspension of the officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kerala-inspector-suspended-as-students-death-triggers-furore/article37714360.ece
27 November 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||HC takes up Sabarimala pilgrims’ issue||Any restriction on Sabarimala pilgrimage or its stoppage due to emergent situations or extreme weather conditions should be immediately intimated to the Special Commissioner and the executive officer for making arrangements for helping pilgrims, the Kerala High Court has directed. Such measures are necessary for the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) to assist the stranded pilgrims at Sabarimala, Pampa and Nilackal and to provide them food, said an order passed by a Division Bench consisting of Justice Anil Narendran and Justice P.G. Ajithkumar on Friday. The court issued the instructions to the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) and the district administration while considering a special report from the Special Commissioner regarding the stranded pilgrims on November 20 following the temporary prohibition on visitors to the temple due to heavy rain. Remove encroachments In another order, the Bench directed the State Government and the Public Works Department (PWD) Secretary to maintain the roads and pedestrian facilities strictly in conformity with the relevant standards and guidelines. No encroachments should be allowed on the right of way or on the pedestrian facilities. Safety of road users The safety of the most vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians, cyclists, children, elderly and differently abled persons, should be ensured, the court directed. The court recorded the statement of the Government that steps for removing hoardings and encroachments on road pavements had already been initiated. The Public Works Department submitted that the repairs and maintenance work of 12 roads were completed. The maintenance and repair works along the Plappilly-Aaghamuzhi- Chittar-Vadasserikkara road would be completed once the laying of pipeline for a drinking water project was completed. Barricades had already been erected to facilitate vehicular traffic on one side, it submitted. Virtual queue The State Government and the Travancore Devaswom Board informed the court that 40,000 devotees should be permitted to offer prayers at Sabarimala through the virtual queue system and another 5,000 through spot booking every day. At present, 30,000 pilgrims were allowed every day. Talks on other measures Discussions for throwing open the traditional trekking route and allowing bath at the Pampa and offering Neyyabhishekam (ghee offering) were on, they submitted. The Special Commissioner reported that fewer than 25,000 pilgrims were reaching every day at the temple these days. Only those spot booking centres at Nilackal, Kottarakara, Pandalam and the Sreekadeswaram temple elicited reasonable response, he submitted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hc-takes-up-sabarimala-pilgrims-issue/article37714358.ece
27 November 2021||Kozhikode,ANDHRA PRADESH||Zika virus confirmed in Kerala; patient cured||A case of Zika virus infection has been confirmed in a 29-year-old woman from Chevayur here on Friday. The woman, a permanent resident of Bengaluru, had developed fever and stomach ache earlier this month and had sought medical help in Bengaluru. However, since the symptoms did not subside, she came to her home at Chevayur on November 15 and sought treatment at a private hospital here. As the doctors here suspected Zika, the samples were sent to the Virology Institutes in Pune and Alappuzha. The results confirmed Zika infection on Friday. However, the patient has been cured of the infection and is recuperating. None of her family members have shown any symptoms and hence, there was no need to panic, Health department sources said. However, the source of her infection is yet to be determined. As she had attended a funeral in Wayanad on October 30 before returning to Bengaluru, she may have contracted the disease either from Wayanad or Bengaluru.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/zika-virus-confirmed-in-kerala-patient-cured/article37714356.ece

27 November 2021||NELLORE,ANDHRA PRADESH||End uncertainty over capital issue, say farmers||Even as the Andhra Pradesh government submitted an affidavit to the High Court on the repeal of the ‘three capital Act’ on Friday, the farmers from Amaravati continued their ‘maha padayatra’, demanding that Amaravati be retained as the sole capital of the State. “The State government must put an end to the uncertainty over the issue as the development had taken a backseat in the wake of its decision of setting up three capitals, belying the hopes of unemployed youth,” Amaravati Parirakshana Samiti co-convenor G. Tirupati Rao said on the 25th day of the march on Friday. Former Union Minister and TDP leader Panabaka Lakshmi, Jana Sena Party Political Affairs Committee chairman Nadandla Manohar, Communist Party of India (Marxist) State secretary P. Madhu and Bharatiya Janata Party MLC Vakati Narayana Reddy were among those who walked for some distance as the ‘maha padaytra’ by a group of 157 farmers resumed from North Rajupalem village after a day’s break. “Amaravati was decided as the State capital only after a broad consensus among all parties, including the YSR Congress Party,” Ms. Lakshmi said while expressing solidarity with the farmers who have so far covered a distance of over 360 km during their ‘maha padayatra’. The YSRCP government had no mandate to trifurcate the capital now, she observed. Without standing on prestige, the YSRCP government should retain Amaravati as the sole capital, Mr. Manohar said. Thousands of activists of the opposition parties walked in tandem with the farmers who concluded their march for the day at Nellore, after covering a distance of 16 km.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/end-uncertainty-over-capital-issue-say-farmers/article37715170.ece
27 November 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Day-long stir held to mark one year of farmers’ protest||Enthused by the Central government’s decision to repeal the three farm laws, members of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, joined by activists of the central trade unions and like-minded civil society organisations, held a day-long stir to mark one year of the farmer protests across the country. Inaugurating the protest, SKM Prakasam district convener Ch. Ranga Rao said that they would continue their struggle with renewed vigour to press for statutory backing to the Minimum Support Price (MSP) regime. Farming could be turned into a profitable venture only when remunerative price for the farmers produce was ensured as per the formula evolved by agriculture scientist M.S. Swaminathan, said All India Kisan Sabha district secretary Vadde Hanuma Reddy. Their struggle was just not against the farm laws but also against amendment to the Electricity Act to phase out power subsidy to the farm sector, explained Andhra Pradesh Rythu Coolie Sangham district secretary Lalitha Kumar. Andhra Pradesh Rythu Sangam leader P. Hanumantha Rao demanded justice for the families of farmers killed in the violence at Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh. The Centre’s decision, though belated, was welcome, said Acharya N.G.Ranga Kisan Sabha general secretary Chunchu Seshaiah while urging that land be allotted for building a memorial for the over 700 farmers who lost their lives during the year-long struggle. Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) district secretary Ch. Srinivasa Rao and AITUC district secretary P.V. Chowdary urged the Centre to withdraw the new labour code as well as privatisation of the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) and other public sector units. Organisation for Protection of Democracy State vice-president Ch. Sudhakar demanded the dropping of Union Minister Ajay Mishra and his arrest in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri violence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/day-long-stir-held-to-mark-one-year-of-farmers-protest/article37715160.ece

27 November 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Malayalam lyricist Bichu Thirumala passes away||Lyricist Bichu Thirumala, who penned many a popular film song known for their poetic quality, passed away on Friday. He was 80. He had been under treatment at a private hospital following a cardiac arrest a few days ago and under ventilator support. Bichu had been prolific as a lyricist in Malayalam mainstream cinema from the 1970s till the 1990s, penning around 3,000 film songs, several non-film and devotional songs. However, despite penning songs by the dozens every month, he ensured that most of them stood out for their lyrical quality. For Bichu, lyrics was not just something to go with the tune. The words bore a character and an existence of their own, perhaps why many of his film lyrics would easily fit in a poetry collection. Born B. Sivasankaran Nair, he gave early hints of his literary bent by penning a play as a student at University College here. In 1970, he worked as an assistant to M. Krishnan Nair. One of his poems published in a magazine during this time opened the doors to writing lyrics in films. Bhajagovindam , the first film he wrote lyrics for, never released. However, by 1975 he began receiving several offers. Within a few years, he established himself as one of the most sought-after lyricists. Unique imageries Even as his lines, with its simplicity, remained accessible to the common people, he demonstrated a talent for conjuring up unique imageries through his words, evident in the song Neelajalashayathil... from Angeekaram (1977). Through his words, Bichu used the same imagery to evoke different emotions and contexts for different songs. For instance, the imagery of the eye was used in Mizhiyoram nananjozhukum... ( Manjil Virinja Pookkal ), Kannum kannum... ( Angadi ), Aayiram kannumayi... ( Nokkethadoorath Kannumnattu ) and Mizhiyariyathe... ( Niram ). He introduced many a word that are not commonly used in the mainstream film lyric vocabulary. His extensive reading habits enabled him to produce lyrics of exquisite quality in no time. He also wrote some of the film songs as well as memorable lullabies that are immensely popular with children, be it Olathumbathirunnu... ( Pappayude Swantham Appoos ), Unnikale oru kadha parayam..., Kilukil pambaram... ( Kilukkam ), Unni aarariro... ( Avalude Ravukal ) or Kannodu kannoram nee... ( Ente Mamattikuttiyammakku ). Through the decades, he constantly kept on updating himself, which enabled him to appeal to the youth of different generations. In 1984, at the heights of the disco wave, he wrote Oru madhura kinavin... ( Kanamarayathu ), while in 1990, he penned Unnam marannu... ( In Harihar Nagar ) and in 1999, he came up with Prayam nammil... ( Niram ), all of which became youth anthem of sorts in their time. Bichu also poignantly captured the sense of longing and nostalgia through songs such as Evideyo kalanju poya kaumaram... ( Sakthi ). He has worked with a range of composers, from M.S. Baburaj to A.R. Rahman, but his longest partnership perhaps was with Shyam, with whom he worked in 75 films. Notably, his partnership with Raveendran produced some evergreen songs, including Ottakkambi naadam... ( Thenum Vayambum ) and Ezhu swarangalum thazhuki varunnoru ganam... ( Chiriyo Chiri ). He had proved to be adept at moulding words to suit all kinds of situations, evident in songs such as Padakali... ( Yodha ) and Oottippattanam... ( Kilukkam ). In most such songs, the words too carried a rhythm of their own, while also remaining meaningful. State film awards Bichu won the State Film Award for the Best Lyricist in 1981 for Thenum Vayambum and Thrishna and in 1991 for Kadinjool Kalyanam . A collection of his poems was published under the title Kalathinte Kanakku Pusthakam . Some of his non-film albums, such as Vasantha Geethangal in which he worked with K. J. Yesudas and Raveendran, had a wide appeal, with songs like Mamankam... gaining much popularity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/malayalam-lyricist-bichu-thirumala-passes-away/article37714362.ece
27 November 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Midnight water release from Peruru tank triggers panic||The inundation of residential colonies in western Tirupati during the recent rains has triggered a debate among the public as well as the political parties that whether it was a natural calamity or a man-made disaster. The issue assumed significance with politicians of Tirupati and Chandragiri locking horns over the damage caused to the former due to water bodies located in the latter. The release of water from the Peruru tank yet again late on Thursday triggered a panic among the villagers, who blocked the highway around midnight. The police had to intervene and resort to a mild lathi-charge, injuring a woman in the melee. The YSRCP was caught on the backfoot over the unexpected incident. The rumour that made rounds was that water was deliberately released from the Peruru tank to save Thummalagunta, the native village of the local legislator Chevireddy Bhaskar Reddy, who refuted the allegation. With the villagers and the political leaders demanding an explanation, Mr. Reddy took an all-party delegation comprising Tirupati MLA B. Karunakar Reddy, Congress leader P. Naveen Kumar Reddy, BJP spokespersons G. Bhanuprakash Reddy and S. Srinivas, Left party leader K. Kumar Reddy and others to the Peruru, Pathakalva and Thummalagunta areas to explain that the inundation of Tirupati had nothing to do with the release of water from the Peruru tank. The natural course of flow is such that the excess water from Peruru tank flows through Nalanda Nagar, Sri Padmavathi Mahila Viswa Vidyalayam (SPMVV) campus, SV Dairy Farm to reach the nonexistent ‘Pedda Cheruvu’, over which the Sub-Collector’s Office, Tirupati rural and urban Tahsildar’s offices and police parade ground stand today. Similarly, water from the western side of Tirumala hills also flow through SV Agricultural College and SV Veterinary University to reach the same spot. Mr. Bhaskar Reddy showed old village maps to prove that water had always flowed naturally to this spot to buttress his claim that it was not man-made. The MLA insisted that the much-smaller Thummalagunta tank was at a level lower than Peruru and Tirupati, and hence would never cause flooding of the upper reaches. However, the flooding is attributed by all to the rampant encroachment of water bodies and supply channels over the last few decades and the inaction on the part of the powers that be.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/panic-over-midnight-water-release-in-ap/article37714579.ece
27 November 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Central team visits flood-hit villages||The inter-Ministerial central team visited the flood-hit villages of Tirupati and Chandragiri constituencies in Chittoor district on Friday. The team of officials comprising Kunal Satyarthi, advisor, National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) , Abhey Kumar, Director, Department of Expenditure (Ministry of Finance), K. Manoharan, Director of Agriculture, cooperation and farmers’ welfare, Srinivasu Bairy, Superintending Engineer, Ministry of Water Resources, Shivani Sharma, Director, Ministry of Power, Shravan Kumar Singh, SE- cum-Regional Officer, Ministry of Road and Highways and Anil Kumar Singh, Under Secretary, Ministry of Rural Development, inspected the flood-hit areas. Chittoor Collector M. Hari Narayanan accompanied the team. The team inspected the damaged paddy crop at Bhimavaram village, where the farmers gave vent to their grievances that 32 of the 180 families had suffered losses to the standing crop that was ready for harvest. When the team went around the Bhima river area, the Collector informed the team that similar was the situation in Punganur area due to surge in water flow. The members of the Central team walked up to Kuchivaripalle and could not reach the waterlogged Moolapalle. ‘Rayalacheruvu safe’ Meanwhile, Mr. Hari Narayanan confirmed that the Rayalacheruvu was safe and the breached portion of the bund had been covered with sand bags. Even as water was found leaking out from another spot, some 100 metres away from the point where a breach was developed, the officials and technical crew rushed to find out a solution. Normalcy was restored in the mammoth tank after the outflow was increased to match the rising inflows, thus striking a balance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/central-team-visits-flood-hit-villages/article37714580.ece
27 November 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||State has tackled flood situation well, says Jagan||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Friday said the State government had been undertaking relief and rescue measures without lapses and provided compensation to flood-affected families within one week of the calamity, while the Opposition was trying to politicise the issue. The Chief Minister told the Legislative Assembly on Friday that Kadapa, Chittoor, Anantapur and Nellore districts were badly affected by heavy rains and floods like never before. Yet, the Opposition parties were politicising the issue and raised objections for him not visiting the flood-hit areas. “I wanted to visit the rain/flood-affected districts, but senior officials advised that it could hamper relief works. The rescue operations were the need of the hour. An aerial survey was done, also relief works are being constantly reviewed. The neighbouring Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik effectively monitors such situations from his office, he said, adding, “I will personally visit the flood-affected areas.” Responding to the Opposition leader N. Chandrababu’s remarks saying “CM will come in the air, go in the air”, the Chief Minister said: “It is not sensible to make such harsh statements for a leader with 40 years experience.” A total of 1,990 villages in 119 mandals in four districts were affected by the floods, of which 211 villages were completely inundated resulting in 44 deaths while 16 were still missing. Over 1169 houses were completely damaged and 5,434 houses were partially damaged. A dedicated control room was set up and food staples along with safe drinking water was supplied to 95,949 families of the flood-affected areas, the Chief Minister said. Besides these, Rs. 2,000 was given to each family, and an ex gratia of Rs. 5 lakh was given to the kin of the deceased. Further, the government was paying compensation for the loss of 5,286 livestock and organising medical camps of about 653, along with veterinary camps, he said. With regard to property loss, Mr. Jagan said the government was paying up to Rs. 5.200 for each of 5,434 partially damaged houses and Rs. 95,000 for each of 1,169 fully damaged houses. Besides these, an additional Rs. 1.8 lakh was being sanctioned for the construction of new houses. An amount of Rs. 84 crore was released for immediate use to the District Collectors. All the district authorities were involved in relief works and being supervised by Ministers or elected representatives of the respective areas. The compensations were paid to the affected within a week, unlike the previous government where it was paid only after several months. The government had been providing all compensation with transparency , Mr. Jagan added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/state-has-tackled-flood-situation-well-says-jagan/article37715178.ece
27 November 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||CAG raps government on financial management||The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has rebuked the State government over the gross financial mismanagement, particularly in failing to contain the mounting revenue deficit, and violation of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM Act). The CAG’s State Finances Audit Report for the year ending March 2020 was tabled in the Assembly on Friday. The CAG observed that the government’s failure to “assess its revenues realistically” and not containing the Revenue Expenditure resulted in continued increase in Revenue Deficit, despite receipt of post-devolution Revenue Deficit grant from the Centre as per the recommendations of Fourteenth Finance Commission. Unbridled revenue expenditure and constricted capital expenditure had pushed Andhra Pradesh’s finances into disarray, causing a revenue deficit of a staggering Rs. 26,441 crore (1,486.28% over the estimate) in the year 2019-20. The Revenue Deficit as a percentage of Total Revenue Receipts (TRR) increased from 12.12% in 2018-19 to 23.81% during 2019-20. Further, the revenue deficit also increased by 90.24% when compared to 2018-19, the report said. Capital expenditure The CAG found fault with the government over the grossly decreased capital expenditure in the year 2019-20 and said it pointed to the need for a review of the fiscal strategy and creation of the fiscal space for increased capital expenditure, which, in turn, would help in promoting and accelerating equitable growth. The liabilities of the State had been increasing year-on-year and, over 80% of the borrowings during 2019-20 were utilised only to balance the Revenue Account, affecting asset creation. The CAG noted that there were instances of misclassification of revenue transactions under capital section and non-accounting of other liabilities that would have pushed up the deficits further. The outstanding debt of the State showed an increasing trend during the five-year period 2015-20. The debt that was Rs. 1,73,854 crore during 2015-16, mounted to Rs. 3,01,802 crore in 2019-20, marking an increase of 73.60%, the CAG pointed out. The off-budget borrowing liability of Rs. 26,096.98 crore has not been disclosed appropriately as part of the State budget documents. “This has the impact of diluting public financial management and oversight role of the Legislature and placing major sources of funding of government’s infrastructure projects beyond the control of the Legislature,” the CAG remarked in the report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cag-raps-government-on-financial-management/article37715179.ece
27 November 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Veggie prices shoot up 100% in three months||It’s not just tomato but the prices of almost all vegetables have soared, making it difficult for the common man to make ends meet. Currently, tomatoes are sold at Rs. 70 a kg while most other vegetables cost not less than Rs. 40. The government, however, blames it on heavy rains that lashed the State. The steep price rise is mainly attributed to crop damage due to rain/flood in several areas. A cursory look at the prices in the last three months indicates that there has been a more than 100% increase in rates since September. On September 25, a basket of 16 varieties of vegetables had cost Rs. 375. The price went up to Rs. 469 per 12 varieties on October 25 and stands at Rs. 755 on November 25. “There is a more than 100% increase in prices,” says an official who didn’t want to be quoted. During the period, the price of a kg of brinjal shot up to Rs. 44 from Rs. 16, lady’s finger to Rs. 48 from Rs. 12 and Maharashtra onion variety to Rs. 35 from Rs. 25 and Kurnool variety to Rs. 28 from Rs. 20 per kg. Ridge gourd price went up from Rs. 20 a kg on September 25 to Rs. 30 on October 25 and Rs. 45 on November 25. The rates of other vegetables like cabbage, potato, ivy gourd, bitter gourd and cucumber continued to soar since September, causing a dent in the budget of homemakers. Says Rama Tulasi, a housewife, “The kitchen expenditure has increased drastically due to the rise in vegetable prices and it is getting very difficult to manage.” The price spiral has kept buyers away from the usually crowded Rythu Bazaars. “The footfall has drastically fallen. Primarily, it is due to rising prices. The inflation is more than 60%,” says an Estate Officer of a Rythu Bazaar in the city. If vegetable vendors are to be believed, then the prices of veggies will remain high for another month and may go up further if there is another spell of rain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/veggie-prices-shoot-up-100-in-three-months/article37714591.ece

27 November 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Jagan tells MPs to raise key issues in Parliament||Ahead of the winter session of Parliament from Monday (November 29), Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy urged his party MPs to secure the Centre’s approval for the cost escalation of the Polavaram project to Rs. 55,657 crore. In a meeting with them on Friday, he said the State government had spent Rs. 2,104 crore on the project, which needed to be reimbursed by the Centre. He said the MPs should emphasise on the power, irrigation and water components of the project and directed them to raise all the six major issues that were discussed in the recent Southern Zonal Council meet, in both the Houses. Referring to the National Food Security Act and its ‘irrational selection of beneficiaries’, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy reminded the MPs that the Centre owed Rs. 1,703 crore to the A.P. Civil Supplies Corporation and another Rs. 4,976.51 crore for implementation of the employment guarantee scheme. Pointing to the fact that post-bifurcation, Telangana had utilised power from A.P. and that the State was to receive dues of Rs. 6,112 crore, he asked the MPs to get the Centre’s nod for clearance of that money, along with the interest. The Chief Minister said at the time of bifurcation, the State had a resource gap funding of Rs. 22,948 crore, while only Rs. 4,117.89 crore was given. He wanted the MPs to get the Centre’s nod to fill the gap. According to the CAG report, the gap was of about Rs. 16,078.76 crore and if arrears of the employees’ PF were added it would be Rs. 22,948.76 crore, he said, directing them to also take up the issue of imposing a cut in the current loans, citing excess borrowings, which he said were made by the previous government. He wanted the MPs to make an effective presentation of the damage caused by the recent floods in the State and seek Rs. 1,000 crore as immediate relief. The BC census, privatisation of the Visakha Steel Plant, Disha Bill and financial assistance to build basic infrastructure in Jagananna colonies were the other issues he wanted the party leaders to take up and asked them to extend their support to the farmers’ demand on the MSP Bill.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jagan-tells-mps-to-raise-key-issues-in-parliament/article37715285.ece

27 November 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Lambasingi beckons as winter approaches||There is a nip in the air, heralding both the onset of winter and a flurry of tourism activity in the Agency areas of the district. A hot favourite this time of the year is the sleepy little village of Lambasingi, which has earned the epithet of ‘Andhra’s Kashmir’ as the minimum temperatures here have dropped to near-zero in the past. The Regional Agricultural Research Station at Chintapalli gives out estimated weather readings for Lambasingi, which is 19 km away. The lowest temperature recorded was 1° Celsius on various occasions such as December 30, 1998, January 5, 1999, January 17, 2003, and most recently on January 15, 2012. Situated at an elevation of 1,000 metres, Lambasingi offers excellent views of the countryside and its undulating grassy slopes offer an ideal place for pitching tents. On average, around 500 tourists visit Lambasingi on weekdays and the number doubles on the weekends. The footfalls pick up further with the advent of Karthika Masam, post-Deepavali. The Cheruvula Venam offers stunning views of the sunrise over the mountains, particularly in the winter when a canopy of clouds forms over the valley below. Tourists arrive here early in the morning before daybreak to take pictures. The Tanjangi reservoir, where the clouds gently hover over the waters of the lake, is another major attraction, Accommodation woes The biggest hurdle in visiting Lambasingi is the lack of accommodation here, forcing tourists to stay overnight at Narsipatnam, which is 30 km away. Scores of temporary accommodations have come up with bamboo fencing and makeshift toilets at Lambasingi. While tribal people are permitted to set up temporary accommodation or give their spare rooms on rent to tourists, even non-tribals are said to be pitching tents to take advantage of the peak tourist season. ITDA Project Officer Ronanki Gopalakrishna held a meeting with officials recently at Paderu and issued instructions that only tribal people should be allowed to provide tents as accommodation for tourists. A.P. Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC) has four modern non-AC tents at Lambasingi and all are usually full. The cost of each room is Rs. 1,500 on weekdays and Rs. 2,000 on weekends. The Haritha Hill Resort of APTDC at Lambasingi is nearing completion. Once they are opened, it would provide an additional accommodation, say APTDC sources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/lambasingi-beckons-as-winter-approaches/article37714351.ece
27 November 2021||Visakhapatnam,ANDHRA PRADESH||Employees organise ‘Vanta Varpu’ at four places against sale of VSP||The workers and employees of the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP), their family members, trade union representatives, displaced persons and their families cooked food on the streets at four places as part of their ‘Vanta Varpu’ protest demanding that the Centre repeal its decision on strategic sale of the VSP. The protests were held at Kurmannapalem, Peda Gantyada, near the Telugu Talli statue and at the junction near the Administrative Office Building simultaneously on Friday as part of the ongoing struggles, under the aegis of the Visakha Ukku Parirakshana Committee (VUPPC), to save the steel plant from privatisation. Speaking at the protest near Peda Gantyada Junction, VUPPC chairman Ch. Narasinga Rao said, “Today (November 26) is the National Constitution Day and it also marks the completion of one year of the farmers protests against the farm laws. The agitation against privatisation of VSP is nearly 10-months-old. The Constitution says that core industries should remain in the public sector but the Union government wants to hand them over to corporate groups, in violation of the spirit of the Constitution.” Representatives of Ukku Nirvasitula Sangham wondered why Mr. Narendra Modi was against the people of the State. The Centre has repealed the farm laws after the farmers agitated for nearly one year. They said that the agitation to save VSP would be intensified and would be stopped only when the Centre repeals its decision. They alleged that the Union government was keen on selling VSP lands to raise thousands of crores as revenue. The VUPPC leaders garlanded the statue of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar near the Administrative Office Building of the VSP. They released a souvenir on the farmers’ agitation. The speakers alleged that the BJP government was trampling upon the rights given to the people by the Constitution and it was the responsibility of each and every individual to uphold those rights. They said that a unanimous resolution was adopted in the Assembly opposing the decision of the Centre on the strategic sale of the VSP, but it was not considered by the BJP government, which has appointed Legal and Transaction Advisers to go ahead with the ‘strategic sale’. They said that the advisers would not be allowed to set foot in the plant premises and if the VSP management cooperated with them, it would have to face the consequences from the steel employees. The VUPPC leaders warned that if the peaceful agitation was not heeded by the Centre, they would not hesitate to intensify the struggles. Members of Jana Sema Party led by senior leader Kona Tata Rao also participated in the programme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/employees-organise-vanta-varpu-at-four-places-against-sale-of-vsp/article37715295.ece

27 November 2021||VIZIANAGARAM/SRIKAKULAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Sugarcane farmers in distress as factories grind to a halt||For the first time in the last few decades, there will be no crushing of sugarcane in the two sugar factories in Vizianagaram district, pushing into distress hundreds of farmers who have grown the crop in the district. The Bhimsingi sugar factory which was closed for ‘renovation’ stopped crushing. The NCS sugar factory at Sithanagaram near Bobbili has also declined to take up crushing this year citing various reasons. It had informed the Cane Commissioner’s office that the crop was inadequate to take up crushing as farmers had opted for other crops. “NCS sugars told the government that it needed 5,000 metric tonnes of sugarcane per day to operate the machinery but was not assured of it. The company feared that it would incur huge losses if crushing is taken up with 70,000 tonnes of crop for the whole season,” said Vizianagaram Collector A. Suryakumari. Recently, Minister for Municipal Administration Botcha Satyanarayana organised a meeting to resolve the issues and ensure payment of Rs. 16.53 crore arrears to farmers. However, the sale of lands of NCS Sugars could not be completed due to administrative delays and other reasons. Lok Satta Party State president Bhisetti Babji urged the government to take up steps for the revival of agro-based industries in the districts immediately since they were providing livelihood to many people directly and indirectly. A similar situation is prevailing in Srikakulam district. The Amadalavalasa sugar factory, which was under cooperative sector, closed 18 years ago. However, crushing is continuing in a private factory. YSRCP leader Chintada Ravikumar, who took up one lakh signature campaign on the issue, urged Collector Shrikesh B. Lathkar to hold a meeting with stakeholders to explore opportunities for its reopening. Recently, the Collector visited the factory and interacted with the officials to know the reasons for its closure. Lack of sufficient sugarcane for crushing and heavy expenditure for renovation were among the reasons he was given. Mr. Shrikesh assured the local public representatives that a detailed report would be sent to the government explaining the ground situation and the aspirations of the farmers. “Many farmers stopped growing sugarcane as crushing was halted. They will certainly grow the crop if they are assured of the revival of the factory,” said Mr. Ravikumar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sugarcane-farmers-in-distress-as-factories-grind-to-a-halt/article37715162.ece

27 November 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Efficient surveillance key to check COVID pandemic’||Efficient surveillance that includes more testing and sewage surveillance is the key to control the current COVID situation. Testing those with obvious COVID symptoms and random testing in offices, educational institutions and gatherings should be stepped up for quickly identifying COVID positive patients and isolating them to arrest the virus spread, said Tata Institute for Genetics & Society (TIGS) director and scientist Rakesh Mishra. Sewage surveillance Governments should also invest in sewage surveillance, which is pretty effective, unbiased and inexpensive, and can give an early indication of any surge in cases 5-6 days in advance for the authorities concerned to act and take precautionary measures, he said in an exclusive interaction on Friday. The former CSIR-Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB) director, involved in genome sequencing and testing protocols from the time the pandemic broke in March 2020 and who continues to work in the institute here, cautioned that the “SARS-CoV-2 virus is still around and there is no reason to become complacent even as many activities have resumed”. While studies and research so far have been mostly confined to major cities, population in the towns and villages as well as unvaccinated people, including children, continue to be vulnerable. Hence, COVID appropriate behaviour cannot be wished away, he insisted. “Masks should be made mandatory by the governments. We cannot keep restaurants or cinemas indefinitely shut, so we should ensure the staff is fully vaccinated and masked. Still, there is an element of risk once you remove the mask in such places or in public transport,” affirmed Dr. Mishra. The pace of vaccination in the country has been decent and the focus should continue to rapidly fully vaccinate the remaining population and ensure the second dose for those who had already taken the first dose. Booster dose “We can think of a third or booster dose for the vulnerable sections after maximum coverage through vaccination. Vaccines are good and working well. But, they are not a guarantee of not getting infected. However, there are less chances of falling sick and mostly it could be mild. It could become serious for the aged and immuno-compromised, so we cannot take any chances,” he said on Friday. Antibodies’ presence is known to decline due to various factors over passage of time despite vaccination, but, the body has cellular immunity to give protection, and hence there is no need to be alarmed on this count, he asserted. “We cannot afford to relax as we have not reached the finish line. With a little more discipline and caution for a few more months, we can get over this pandemic, without much pain,” Dr. Rakesh Mishra added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/efficient-surveillance-key-to-control-coronavirus/article37714912.ece
27 November 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||People urged to buy RERA registered properties only||The Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI) Hyderabad and Telangana, Telangana Real Estate Developers' Association (TREDA), Telangana Builders Federation (TBF), and Telangana Developers Association (TDA) jointly launched an initiative to caution people to purchase TS-RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Authority) registered properties only, on Friday. The objective of the ‘Be safe, be sure’ campaign, which has brought all the real estate bodies together, is to educate people about the risks of purchasing unapproved, UDS (undivided share) properties and the pre-sales, pre-launch properties without taking the required approvals from regulatory agencies like the HMDA/GHMC, and RERA. The campaign was launched by P. Rama Krishna Rao, CREDAI Hyderabad president, general secretary V. Rajashekar Reddy, Ch. Ramchandra Reddy, CREDAI TS chairman, president D. Murali Krishna Reddy, R Chalapathi Rao, TREDA president, secretary general B Sunil Chandra Reddy, C Prabhakar Rao, president of Telangana Builders Federation (TBF), G.V. Rao - president of Telangana Developers Association (TDA), and others. The real estate bodies want to educate the customers about the risks in purchasing unapproved, UDS, pre-launch and pre-sale properties and about the benefits of purchasing those registered in TS-RERA. They also aim to reach out to the government to initiate appropriate punitive action against ‘unscrupulous’ operators resorting to such illegal sales. “Some firms are offering attractive schemes before taking any plan approvals or RERA registration to lure home-buyers and investors. The cost at which they are selling the properties is not sufficient to cover the construction expenditure so can never be successfully completed. The amounts thus collected could be diverted for other purposes,” they charged. “Projects registered under RERA only should be advertised and sold as it steps in to protect buyers’ rights. In the event of developers failing on their promises, little can be done for pre-launch and UDS works,” they explained. TS-RERA registered properties guarantees transparency in approvals, timely execution and delivery, they said and appealed to the government to curb such ‘high-risk illegal practices’, strengthen RERA and also take action against those resorting to such “unhealthy business deals.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/buy-rera-registered-properties-only-credai/article37714923.ece
27 November 2021||hyderabad,TELANGANA||‘Get Rs. 20,000 crore for Medak’||TPCC working president and Sangareddy legislator T. Jayaprakash Reddy has challenged Finance Minister T. Harish Rao to get Rs. 20,000 crore for the local bodies of the combined Medak district and he would ask his wife to withdraw from the Local Body MLC elections. “If my wife Nirmala Jagga Reddy wins I will get the same money to the district when the Congress returns to power in 2023,” he said in an informal chat with media persons here. He said Mr. Harish Rao totally ignored the local body representatives in the last two years he forced to talk to them because of the elections. If the elections were unanimous ZPTCs, MPTCs and mMunicipal councillors would have been totally neglected by the Minister but he was now talking to them as the Congress candidate is in the fray. “TRS representatives are getting some respect due to the Congress candidate,” he said asking them to vote for the Congress candidate Nirmala Jagga Reddy to continue to get the same respect from the TRS leadership. The Congress MLA said power in local bodies had been diluted and elected representatives remained powerless in the TRS rule unlike the previous Congress rule. It was time they realised how they were being humiliated by Mr. Harish Rao making them mere puppets in the hands of officials, he said. “Whether you want to remain slaves or exercise your constitutional power is in your hands,” he told the local body representatives. Jeevan Reddy offer Senior Congress leader and MLC T. Jeevan Reddy has offered to take care of the present procurement crisis if Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao is ready to set aside Rs. 5,000 crore, and he would ensure farmers of all crops come out of the present crisis safely. At a press conference here, Mr. Jeevan Reddy said the government should announce some support price to plug the difference between the procurement prices and what the market forces were forcing the farmers to sell at. Even if the entire cultivation in Telangana is taken into account all that government has to spend is Rs. 10,000 per acre to overcome the difference. And this would not cost more than Rs. 5,000 crore. He said KCR seemed to be believing Rythu Bandhu was the panacea for all the ills and he had cheated farmers on farm loan waiver citing Rythu Bandhu. The government doesn’t have any plan on farm loan disbursement. There is no seed subsidy and no plan on interest waiver either. Mr. Reddy alleged the CM was busy shifting the blame on others while escaping from his responsibility and his promise to the farmers that last grain would be procured. Was it fair for him to leave the farmers in lurch if the Central government was not cooperating, he asked and said this was deceiving the farmers after promising them so much. The Congress MLC demanded that the Chief Minister reveal his New Delhi tour details to the farmers. “He went there issuing threats to the Centre for public posture and has come back without saying a word. Did he bend the Centre’s neck as challenged or did he bend his own neck,” he asked. “If the CM was sincere about Telangana farmers he would have sat on a dharna at Jantar Mantar.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/get-rs-20000-crore-for-medak/article37714937.ece
27 November 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Constitution played a key role in protecting foundation of democracy’||Indian Constitution has proved to be effective in strengthening the country’s unity in diversity and played a supreme role in protecting the rock solid foundation of democracy in India, opined Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan. Calling for upholding the constitutional values and ideals and its supremacy, she paid tributes to Dr. B.R. Ambedkar in drafting the Constitution as the Chairman of the Drafting Committee, and preparing one of the comprehensive constitutions in the world. “We can pay our real tributes to the architects of our Constitution by promoting its spirit at all levels,” she said. She was speaking during Constitution Day celebrations at Raj Bhavan here on Friday. She expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for initiating Constitution Day celebrations since 2015 to commemorate its adoption by the Constituent Assembly on November 26, 1949. Chief Justice of the Telangana High Court Justice Satish Chandra Sharma said that the Constitution guided the life and culture of all Indian citizens and felt that its proper working rests with the judiciary and the bar in one way or the other. At the same time, he felt it was the responsibility of every citizen to contribute to the efficient working of the Constitution and the institutions created under it. High Court judges, Ministers and other senior officials of the government participated and paid rich tributes to the architects of the Constitution. They also read out the Preamble, and offered floral tributes to the portraits of Mahatma Gandhi, BR Ambedkar and the Constitution. Promise betrayed: Asad AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi on Friday said that the Constitution of India established the rule of law and protected citizens from state excesses, but the constitutional promise was betrayed often vis-a-vis marginalised communities. He took to Twitter on Constitution Day, and stated, “Constitution is a documentation of dreams that our elders saw for us. It replaced rule by men with rule of law.” “This constitutional promise has been betrayed often. Especially when it pertained to Muslims, Dalits or Adivasis. It’s still worth fighting for.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/constitution-protected-democracy/article37714918.ece

Scores of men took to the streets in the afternoon and walked from Bada Bazaar to Dabeerpura Darwaza in the old city. Protesters raised slogans against Rizvi and demanded that he be arrested for what they said are blasphemous remarks he made in his books. Protesters with black flags marched with banners in their hands criticising Rizvi. Meanwhile, Deputy Commissioner of Police (South Zone) Gajarao Bhupal told The Hindu that the protestors did not have permission. He went on to add that the issue is being looked into and that a case would be booked shortly. In the recent past, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen president Asaduddin Owaisi led a delegation of legislators from his party, met Hyderabad City Police Commissioner, and requested him to book a case against Rizvi. Within a few hours, a case under relevant section of the Indian Police Code was slapped against the former UP Shia Waqf Board chairman.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/protests-break-out-in-old-city/article37715243.ece
27 November 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||HC notices to State over MMTS second phase||Telangana High Court on Friday issued notices to State government and the South Central Railway (SCR) in a PIL petition seeking operationalisation of second phase of Multi Modal Transport System (MMTS) trains. The petition was filed by social activist and CPI(M) city secretary M. Srinivas Reddy requesting the court to instruct the SCR general manager to start running MMTS trains on the completed sections of tracks under phase-II linking Hyderabad, Secunderabad and Cyberaabd localities. The petitioner also wanted the court to declare the non-completion of total MMTS phase-II lines and not running MMTS services on already completed tracks as illegal and arbitrary. Lawyer N.S. Arjun Kumar appearing for the petitioner said that out of the total 84 km of MMTS second phase, works on 62 km were completed a few months ago. Even the railway safety authorities gave clearance for running MMTS trains on these stretches and they were commissioned for traffic. However, services on these routes were not started as the State government failed to release its share of funds for the project, Mr. Arjun Kumar told the court. An amount of Rs. 808 crore was spent on the project so far. As per the agreement, Telangana government should have borne the expenditure to the tune of Rs. 606 crore. But it contributed only Rs. 129.02 crore. According to the petitioner, the SCR had incurred an expenditure of Rs. 678 crore on the project. The dispute over sharing the costs of the projects between the State government and the SCR had become a stumbling block in starting MMTS services under second phase, he said. The bench posted the matter for December 17.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hc-notices-to-state-over-mmts-second-phase/article37714932.ece

Allotment of 2,336 out of 10,178 houses constructed under the scheme is yet to be done to the eligible beneficiaries due to various reasons. The dream of having their own shelter would be a reality soon, the Minister said at a meeting held with District Collector of Hyderabad L. Sharman and Secunderabad RDO Vasantha Kumari here on Friday. The allotment of 2,336 houses was due in the seven Assembly constituencies in the Hyderabad and Secunderabad Revenue Divisions in the city. He stated that the houses constructed under JNNURM were pending allotment in 16 localities including Hamali Basthi, Gaidanbagh-Kasturba Nagar, Old Patigadda, NBT Nagar, LIC Colony, Veerannagutta, Uppuguda Ex-Servicemen Colony, Phoolbagh, Nandanavanam and Munganur in the seven constituencies.

27 November 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||T-Works, GE Appliances collaborate for oxygen concentrators||Five oxygen concentrators designed and developed by T-Works and assembled by a small group of employees of Haier firm GE Appliances are ready to be donated to those in need. The oxygen concentrators can consistently deliver 90% oxygen concentration at 5 litres per minute. A synthetic chemical substance called zeolite selectively adsorbs nitrogen from the air under the right conditions. The device uses a process called Pressure Swing Absorption to output oxygen-rich air, T-Works said in a release on Friday. It said the devices were designed and developed with support from a wide network of vendors and suppliers. As part of the initiative, GE Appliances employees assembled five concentrators with training from T-Works. Some of the technical challenges that were overcome include handling and packing zeolite, protecting it from moisture, thermal management and reduction of noise and vibration. T-Works CEO Sujai Karampuri said the hardware incubator facilitates innovators in the idea-to-product journey, which extends far beyond proofs-of-concepts and prototypes. “We must inculcate in our culture the importance of balancing creativity and discipline and the need for strong fundamentals in science. Most importantly, we must allow ourselves to fail, learn from them and become better innovators. The partnership with GE Appliances is a stamp of validation not only for this product but also for our process.” After the PoC and prototype stages, multiple devices were assembled and tested, clocking hundreds of hours of runtime. Test data was used to compare performance with the best-in-market O2 concentrators. This provided a solid foundation towards productising the device, the release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/t-works-ge-appliances-collaborate-for-oxygen-concentrators/article37714941.ece
27 November 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Pandemic in tricky phase’||Former CSIR-CCMB director Rakesh Mishra said that the COVID pandemic is in a ‘tricky phase’ where the Delta variant or its off-shoots continue to be dominant. Yet, there is a possibility of a new variant that could go against the vaccines or more severe clinical symptoms could emerge from any corner. “This can come from anywhere, from the north east or from remote villages, therefore, it is all the more important to keep track of the cases and continue genome sequencing of at least 5% of those detected,” Dr. Rakesh Mishra said. Due to the 10,000-odd COVID cases being reported across the country, the INSACOG - Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium, with 28 public and four private labs, need to get a sufficient number of positive samples across the country to keep an effective watch on the emergence of any such variant. “Broadly, it is Delta everywhere or its off-shoots dominating the world with worrisome trends in the United States and Europe. It could be due to winter, indoor gatherings and vaccine hesitancy. Our advantage is the second wave has already infected large number people, >90% sero positivity in major cities, although at a great cost, which is providing roadblock for the virus,” he explained. “We are at present in a good situation and in control but it also depends on us to prevent the virus from freely circulating in the population,” said Dr. Rakesh Mishra.  New variant can come from anywhere, from the north east or from remote villages, and therefore, it is all the more important to keep track of the cases and continue genome sequencing of at least 5% of those detected.

Harish Rao called upon local bodies’ representatives to vote for TRS candidate Yadava Reddy in Local Area Constituency (LAC) MLC elections. Participating in a meeting with them at Patancheru on Friday along with MLA G Mahipal Reddy and others, Mr. Harish Rao said that the BJP had weakened the local bodies for the past few years. “In the past we used to get Finance Commission grants for local bodies- Zilla Parishads and Mandal Parishads. After BJP came to power they were stopped. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao took the initiative and sanctioned about Rs. 500 crore for local bodies from the budget. BJP had done nothing but increased prices of all commodities. Even the prices of petrol were reduced only 25 per cent whereas the hike was many more times than that,” said Mr. Harish Rao. Referring to MLC elections, the Minister said that the TRS had the strength to win elections and the Congress was in contest without needed votes. “We have a strength of 777 voters won on TRS ticket out of the total 1,072 votes. Let us work for the party and follow the directions. Services of former MLC V. Bhupal Reddy will be used for the party in other form. He was the only MLC who had completed three terms successfully. The candidates would be trained on how to vote on priority basis on December 8th and 9th.

27 November 2021||Siddipet,TELANGANA||Two of a family sell their land for Gouravelli reservoir||In a move that would pave the way for the completion of Gouravelli reservoir at Akkannapet mandal in Husnabad revenue division, two persons from a family signed papers and handed over about 16 acres of their land to the government. On Friday Dodala Malla Reddy and his son Rajasekhar Reddy signed the papers to sell the lands to the government in the presence of Husnabad Revenue Divisional Officer (RDO) M. Jayachandra Reddy. They were offered a compensation of Rs. 15 lakh per acre. This is so far the highest amount offered officially in Siddipet district for the displaced persons under any of the five reservoirs — Annapurna (bordering Siddipet and Sircilla), Rangnaiaksagar, Mallannasagar, Kondapochamma and Gouravelli. For the past three months MLC P. Venkatarami Reddy, during his tenure as Siddipet district collector, held several rounds of discussions to convince the oustees to sell the their lands. Initially the oustees were offered a compensation of Rs. 9 lakh per acre, later it was increased to Rs. 11.5 lakh and then Rs. 13 lakh. Finally, the amount was settled at Rs. 15 lakh per acre at Gouravelli, as of now. “This was the result of discussion held primarily on November 13 and later. Today Mr. Malla Reddy and his son Rajasekhar Reddy have signed the papers. Few more may come forward to sign the papers though we have demanded much higher than what the government offered to us. Some of us may wait for some time to get a better price,” said an oustee on condition of anonymity. The amount offered to the oustees of Kondapochamma was Rs. 12 lakh per acre while it was only Rs. 11 lakh per acre for the oustees of Vemulaghat village under Mallannasagar. The residents of Vemulaghat conducted relay fasts (dharnas) for 963 days before finally giving in to the government pressure. “We do not know who others will sign the papers. But my father and I signed the papers today,” Mr. Rajasekhar Reddy told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/two-of-a-family-sell-their-land-for-gouravelli-reservoir/article37715245.ece

27 November 2021||November 27 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||‘Anubhavinchu Raja’ movie review: Nothing redeeming in this boring saga||A twist in the tale happens midway through Anubhavinchu Raja . It was a chance to sit up and think that finally, something is happening. It seemed like an indication of some semblance of a story in the rest of the film. For, whatever preceded the pre-interval twist was meandering and lacklustre, to put it mildly. Sadly, the twist is far from intriguing. Had it been written and executed better, Anubhavinchu Raja could have been a coming-of-age story of an entitled brat. But as it stands, it’s a story that’s lost in a messy narration. The film, produced by Annapurna Studios, begins by doffing its hat to Akkineni Nageswara Rao and Akkineni Nagarjuna and introduces us to the protagonist named Bangarraju (Raj Tarun), clearly a hat tip to the character essayed by Nagarjuna in Soggade Chinni Nayana (2016) and the sequel Bangarraju which is now in the making. However, all this referencing fails to give this film’s protagonist a glamorous edge. Bangarraju is the sole surviving member and inheritor of his family’s massive wealth and lives by his grandfather’s guideline of living life king size. We see him as an adolescent, with all the indications of growing up into an entitled jerk in the village. The non-linear screenplay then introduces us to a grown-up Bangarraju who steps out of prison and starts life afresh in Hyderabad as a security guard. This Bangarraju is a changed man who is duty-bound and considerate to people. What makes him turn a new leaf and how he gets to the bottom of a conspiracy forms the rest of the story. But before we know the truth, we endure a film where romance, comedy and crime evoke little interest. Bangarraju falls in love with Shruti (Kashish Khan), an IT employee in one of the offices in Cyber Pearl. Her characterisation can be best described as a stereotypical cute-but-dumb heroine. Is there something new? Sure, she hates her wavy hair and straightens it each day. The hero prefers her as she is and she makes peace with her curls. This aspect is addressed so often with her deliberating on using the straightener that it is a bore. The actual conflict point that is revealed towards the climax is also old school, and not in a good way. Been there, seen that in many mainstream films. A ‘supari’ gang is thrown in to pave way for a few action sequences. Raj Tarun is energetic as usual and emotes according to what the story requires him to do. But there isn’t one scene that gives him the scope to make a lasting impression, not even in the poignant moments. Adarsh Balakrishna is thoroughly wasted and so is ‘ Aadukalam’ Naren.

27 November 2021||GURUGRAM,||Manohar Lal calls on PM Modi||Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal on Friday called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi fuelling speculation of a possible Cabinet expansion and reshuffle. The Cabinet currently has 12 Ministers, including four Ministers of State, leaving two vacancies — one each from the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Jannayak Janta Party. Though Mr. Lal refused to comment on any discussion on the expansion during his 40-minute meeting with Mr. Modi, saying that keeping suspense on the matter was exciting, rumours on the issue had started doing the rounds in Haryana soon after Deepavali and gained momentum after the recent announcement on the repeal of the three farm laws. State Bunit JP sources said the new Cabinet would most likely be in place by the year-end or as early as the month-end. More inclusive “A new-look Cabinet in New Year is a possibility,” said a BJP source, adding that the emphasis would be on greater representation to the Scheduled and the Backward Castes. At least two Ministers from the BJP quota — Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment (Independent Charge) Om Prakash Yadav and Minister of State for Woman and Child Development (Independent Charge) Kamlesh Dhanda, the lone woman Minister — are said to be on a sticky wicket and could be replaced. Mr. Yadav, who represents Narnaul Assembly constituency in South Haryana, could lose his ministerial berth to former IAS and Nangal Chaudhary MLA Abhe Singh Yadav. Ms. Dhanda, a Jat, could be replaced by another Jat MLA Mahipal Dhanda from Panipat Rural to balance the caste equation and ensure adequate representation to the single largest community in the State. Pataudi MLA Satya Prakash Jrawat, a Scheduled Caste, could be a surprise inclusion in a balancing act of increased representation to his community and South Haryana, where the BJP has won the majority of the seats. While Tohana MLA Devender Singh Babli, who trounced former BJP chief Subhash Barala, could be the JJP’s choice for the seat of its quota, the party’s opinion on continuation of Uklanad MLA Anoop Dhanak, Minister of State for Archaeology & Museums (Independent Charge), is rumoured to be divided.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/manohar-lal-calls-on-pm-modi/article37714816.ece
27 November 2021||GURUGRAM,||Protesters hold prayers for 26/11 terror victims near namaz site||Amid continued protests against offering of Friday prayers in open spaces across Gurugram, a group of “locals” at Sector 37 here held a simultaneous prayer remembering the victims of the 26/11 terror attack near a namaz site. Raising slogans such as “Jai Shri Ram” and “Bharat Mata Ki Jai”, a large number of people, claiming to be locals from the neighbouring areas, gathered near Khandsa Chowk in front of Sector 37 police station around noon and began the prayers for the victims. The spot where they gathered is just a stone’s throw from the vacant plot where the Muslims offer namaz every Friday. Though a large number of policemen deployed at the spot prevented any escalation of tension, the members of the group claimed the space used for offering namaz soon after the Muslims left. Letter against prayers In a letter to the office of the Deputy Commissioner on Thursday, the “locals” had alleged that offering of namaz at the vacant plot caused inconvenience to the residents of Khandsa village and the children playing in the ground. The letter stated that offering of namaz also caused traffic jam-like situation on the road nearby. Rights ‘violation’ Demanding that the district administration take action to ensure communal harmony in the area, Altaf Ahmad, member, Gurgaon Muslim Council, said that Article 25 of the Constitution was “violated” on Constitution Day itself. “The far-right wing group has been disrupting obligatory Juma Namaz of Muslims for last three months in Gurugram. It was Sector 37 where they intentionally chose the same spot and time of Juma Namaz for offering their own prayers this Friday; same way as they did for Govardhan Puja in Sector 12A on November 5,” said Mr. Ahmad. He added that around 500 Muslim workers from various industries in the area normally gather to offer namaz at the vacant plot but this Friday only 30-odd could offer prayers due to the protest. Starting from Sector 39 this year, the protests against offering of namaz have gradually spread to Sector 40, 43, 47, 12A and 18 over the past few weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/protesters-hold-prayers-for-2611-terror-victims-near-namaz-site/article37714813.ece

The epicentre was near the boundary with Myanmar, as per the data shared by the Department. It was recorded at 5.15 a.m., at a depth of 35 km, the data showed.

27 November 2021||Hubballi,||COVID cases in medical college rise to 182||With the number of COVID-19 cases going up from 66 to 182, the Dharwad District Administration has sealed down the entire campus of SDM College of Medical Sciences and Hospital in Karnataka’s Dharwad. After holding a meeting to assess the situation in the wake of increased numbers, Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad Nitesh Patil told presspersons on Friday that Out Patients Department in the Hospital had been closed for three days and entry of visitors and attendants of admitted patients had also been banned. This apart, all the patients undergoing various treatments in the hospital are also being tested for the infection and only those who have tested negative for the pandemic are being discharged from the hospital. The Deputy Commissioner said that as there was suspicion about the affected persons being infected by a mutant variant of the virus, the samples have been sent to Bengaluru for genome sequencing. The reports are expected to come by Saturday evening. As a precautionary measure, the schools and colleges in the radius of 500 m from the SDM Medical College campus have also been closed. Swab collection Mr. Patil said that as many as eleven counters had been set up on the campus to collect swabs of the staff and faculty members of the medical college and hospital. There are around 3,500 persons on the campus including, students, doctors, health and other staff and faculty members.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/covid-cases-in-medical-college-rise-to-182/article37714818.ece
27 November 2021||Kolkata,||15 poll pleas pending before HC months after West Bengal polls||Almost six months after the West Bengal Assembly polls, the Trinamool Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party are still battling it out in the courts over the electoral outcome. At least 15 candidates, who had lost in the polls, have approached the Calcutta High Court. These petitions have been filed under the Representation of the People Act, 1951. While the BJP candidates have filed 10, the TMC candidates including Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee are petitioners in five cases. Ms. Banerjee had approached the Calcutta High Court after losing the Nandigram Assembly seat by a narrow margin of 1,956 votes. She filed the petition in June and the matter was assigned to Justice Kaushik Chanda. The TMC chairperson prayed that the petition be transferred to another bench. The matter is now pending before Justice Shampa Sarkar and will come up for hearing on December 1. The other TMC candidates are Alo Rani Sarkar (Bongaon Dakshin), Sangram Kumar Doloi (Moyna), Manas Majumdar (Goghat) and Santiram Mahato (Balarmpur). All of them lost to the BJP candidates. Similarly, 10 BJP candidates have filed petitions before the Calcutta High Court after losing to the TMC nominees. They include leaders like Jitendra Kumar Tiwari (Pandaveshwar), Kalyan Choubey (Manicktala) and Swadhin Kumar Sarkar (Baisabnagar). Legal experts point out that the petitions can go on for months, may be for years. Political observer Biswanath Chakraborty said these petitions should be tried before a fast-track court. Professor Chakraborty, who heads the Department of Political Science at the Rabindra Bharati University, said such petitions also undermine the authority of the Election Commission and raise questions on its transparency. ‘Increasing tendency’ “In West Bengal, there is an increasing tendency by political parties to approach the courts. We see the same happening in the municipal polls. In other parts of the country, we see civil society organisations approaching the courts for the rights of the people. West Bengal being an overtly political State, parties are fighting among themselves eating into the precious time of the courts,” Mr. Chakraborty said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/15-poll-pleas-pending-before-hc-months-after-west-bengal-polls/article37714823.ece
27 November 2021||Kolkata,||Visva-Bharati lagging in research work, quality assessment: NAAC||The National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) team visiting Visva-Bharati for evaluating the quality of its education is said to be unhappy with several things at the Rabindranath Tagore-founded university, finding it lagging in research work and quality assessment. The NAAC assesses and accredits higher education institutions every five years. During the previous assessment, in 2015, the Santiniketan-based Visva-Bharati had scored 2.82 on the four-point scale, thus missing an ‘A’ by 0.18 points. A good score is important for an institution to get projects and grants. “To begin with, the team was irritated that hardly 30-35 teachers were present during its scheduled interaction with faculty members yesterday [Thursday] evening,” a senior faculty member present at the meeting told The Hindu on Friday. “This, when the university has nearly 500 teachers. When the reason for the poor attendance was attributed to the pandemic, the team pointed out that the hall was big enough to accommodate far more people.” “The team seemed to be armed with data and wanted to know why we were lagging in terms of research work. ‘Such an old and prestigious university and so little research of late’ — that’s what they basically said,” the faculty member said. The NAAC team, according to several teachers familiar with the situation, was particularly unhappy with the performance of the university’s Internal Quality Assessment Committee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/visva-bharati-lagging-in-research-work-quality-assessment-naac/article37715030.ece
27 November 2021||Mumbai,||Cong., BJP reach pact on two seats in Council polls||In a rare incident of mutual agreement with the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government to avoid what could have become one of the costliest Council polls in recent times, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership on Friday withdrew its candidate from the Kolhapur local body council seat clearing the way for Congress candidate and State Minister Satej Patil’s unopposed victory. In return, the Congress withdrew its candidate from Nandurbar-Dhule local bodies seat paving the way for the victory of BJP’s Amrish Patel. With this, winners on four of six Legislative Council seats have been declared unopposed. Two seats in Mumbai have already gone to Sunil Shinde (Shiv Sena) and Rajhans Singh (BJP). In Kolhapur, the top State leadership of both Congress and BJP arrived at the agreement mutually amid reports of exorbitant demands from the voters, corporators and councillors of local bodies from both candidates. ‘Monetary demands’ “There were demands of Innova cars from these voters, irrespective of party affiliations. There were monetary demands as well. When it was clear that the whole election was growing out of proportion, it was mutually decided to work out an arrangement,” a source closely associated with the election process in Kolhapur told The Hindu . He said the expenditure from both sides on this single seat alone could have touched Rs. 100 crore. In the remaining two Council seats, Nagpur will see a direct contest between former minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule (BJP) and Ravindra Bhoyar (Congress), a former BJP veteran. In Akola-Washim-Buldhana local bodies seat, Gopikishan Bajoria (Sena) will take on Vasant Khandelwal (BJP). This seat has been with the Sena for four terms when the party was in alliance with the BJP. This is for the first time that both the parties will contest against each other. The election for these two seats will take place on December 10.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/cong-bjp-reach-pact-on-two-seats-in-council-polls/article37714821.ece
27 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Year on, farmers both happy and sad||On November 26 last year, farmers protesting against the three farm reform laws reached the Capital’s borders with a resolve to leave only after their demands were met. A year later, they are both sad and happy at the possibility of returning home, leaving behind the protest sites with which they have developed a spiritual connect. On Friday, as the protest completed a year, the Singhu border was once again buzzing with activities and people flocked to the borders to mark the day and celebrate it with the farmers. A designated place was set up with speakers and a projector for evening celebrations, where a video of the protest’s journey was scheduled to be played. The langars serving jalebis, juices, and pizzas , which had disappeared over the last few months, returned to the site. So did the SUVs with loud music playing on woofers. The Khalsa Aid kiosk, which had also shut down, was seen offering bananas. There were some langars that were functional even after the crowds had dwindled and the media had stopped visiting. One among them, run by the people from Hoshiyarpur, did not stop “even for an hour”. Teary eyed Manjinder Singh, 45, who will complete five months here on December 11, had tears in his eyes when he remembered one of the non-stop rainy days in January. “It was biting cold and it was raining for 24 hours. The tarpaulin came down and I stood for hours trying to hold it. We have seen a very tough time but it has borne fruits,” he smiled as he wiped his tears. Four tents had caught fire on Deepavali, recalled Mr. Manjinder. “We have seen the worst of times but the almighty has given us strength to stay put.” Recalling the tough days, Trilochan Singh, 55, said that reaching the borders was probably the toughest because they were stopped by barricades, lathis and tear gas shells. “I remember living on tea and biscuits for 48 hours till we finally reached here and managed to cook,” he said. “ Ghar jaake ek-do mahine dil ni lagna (Will not feel good for a month or two after going home),” said Kamaljeet Singh, 29, from Fatehgarh Sahib. He announced his plan to return home with a disclaimer that it will happen only after they have it in writing that the farm laws have been repealed and all other demands have been met. Spiritual place For Mr. Kamaljeet, the Singhu border has become a spiritual place, which he would always visit even after the protest ends. Avtar Singh, who runs the Life Care Foundation Hospital, recalled how he had started giving medicines from a table and has now turned it into a full-fledged hospital with tiled floors, doctors, and a lab handling hundreds of patients every month. “This protest has taught us all that patience and perseverance will make you win,” he said. The two recognisable heroes of the protest – Nachchatra Singh, 87, and Santok Singh, 72 – who have been a part of the protest since Day 1 reminisced about their journey. Mr. Nachchatra contracted COVID-19 and was treated at the makeshift hospital at the site for nearly 25 days. He said he didn’t think he would make it but the “almighty had other plans and wanted me to see us winning”. Mr. Santok, who has become a popular figure as the ‘babaji’ who survived the injuries sustained in a clash with police on November 27 last year, said living through extreme weather was nothing compared to the loss of lives during the protest. According to Samyukta Kisan Morcha, 732 people lost their lives in the protest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/year-on-farmers-both-happy-and-sad/article37714801.ece
27 November 2021||New Delhi,||Assembly passes resolution condemning farm laws||The Delhi Assembly on Friday passed a resolution condemning the three farm laws and congratulated the farmers’ unions for their year-long struggle culminating in the legislations being repealed. The resolution also demanded the dismissal and arrest of Union Minister of State (Home) Ajay Kumar Mishra for his “role in the daylight killing of innocent farmers” in Lakhimpur Kheri, U.P., last month. Addressing the Assembly, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal reiterated that the farmers’ “satyagraha” against the three “black laws” was a victory for democracy. “Last year on November 26th, this movement started on the borders of Delhi. It has been one whole year now and this movement has turned out to be successful. I want to congratulate the farmers of the country on this achievement and salute them for their bravery,” Mr. Kejriwal said in his address to the House. “I want to especially recognise the contribution of the farmers of Punjab in this movement. Specifically, how they led everyone towards a common cause,” he said. The Opposition BJP questioned the need for the resolution given the fact that the three laws had already been repealed. Leader of Opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said there was no need to convene the session even as he sought to corner the Delhi Government over the alleged non-implementation of Central schemes in favour of farmers. He also sought an answer from the Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister as to why compensation had not been given to Delhi farmers whose land had been rendered uncultivable due to the heavy rainfall this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/assembly-passes-resolution-condemning-farm-laws/article37714812.ece

Tiwari in a joint letter to Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath said the men seem to have been made scapegoats in “a more sinister plan to create communal tension and disharmony” as a default election strategy. “It is extremely unjust that without any independent inquiry, false cases have been foisted on the seven men and they have been locked up in jail,” they wrote. They also demanded that the SHO responsible for the incident should be booked for attempt to murder and other relevant sections. Ms. Karat and Mr. Tiwari also demanded action against the local MLA Nandkishore Gurjar for his “highly objectionable statements with the intent of creating communal disharmony and enmity between communities”. “He is a serial offender in this regard ,” they said. A CPI(M) team met the families of the seven men who belong to the Rangrez caste. “There is urgent requirement for medical treatment for their gunshot injuries. We were told that one of the victims has also suffered a hairline fracture. The others also require proper treatment. The facilities in jail are not adequate,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/cpim-for-probe-into-ghaziabad-shooting/article37714814.ece
27 November 2021||New Delhi,||EDMC budget proposes property, theatre tax hike||The East Delhi Municipal Corporation on Friday presented its budget estimates for the financial year 2022-23, which stands at Rs. 4,735.77 crore. Commissioner Vikas Anand also presented the revised budget estimates for the financial year 2021-22, which stands at Rs. 4,479.43 crore — lower than the previously approved estimate of Rs. 5,306.48 crore for the current financial year.

For large-scale entertainment events, such as carnivals, the proposed tax rates were hiked from Rs. 10 per show to Rs. 5,000 per show. Tax rate hikes were also proposed for buildings that are to be constructed along with the sanction of the building plans. For up to 50 sq.m, the proposed rates were hiked from Rs. 5 sq.m to Rs. 50 per sq.m. For buildings with plans that exceed 50 sq.m, the proposed rates were hiked from Rs. 10 sq.m to Rs. 100 per sq.m.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/edmc-budget-proposes-property-theatre-tax-hike/article37714805.ece
27 November 2021||New Delhi,||10 child workers rescued from south Delhi market||Ten child workers were rescued from Madangir Bike Market in south Delhi on Friday and five shops were sealed for employing them, said District Magistrate (south) Ankita Chakravarty. The children were employed in various activities related to motorcycle repair, spare parts and fast food, among others.

27 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Two auto drivers held for rape in separate incidents||Two auto drivers were arrested for allegedly raping two women in separate incidents in south-east Delhi, the police said on Friday. A senior police officer said that the first incident was reported on the night of November 23. A 22-year-old woman was on her way home and waiting for an autorickshaw near Shaheen Bagh metro station when an auto driver came and offered to drop her. The driver took her to a desolate place where he first thrashed her for resisting and then raped her before fleeing with her mobile phone, the police said, adding that the woman sustained injuries and was left on the roadside by the accused. She was spotted by locals and admitted to a hospital, the police said. Based on the woman’s complaint, a case was registered on charges of rape and robbery. During investigation, police scanned CCTV footage and details of auto drivers around the area. The accused identified as Vajid, a resident of Jasola, has been arrested, police said. Another incident was reported from Govindpuri, where a 13-year-old girl was sexually assaulted by an auto driver. The accused has been identified as Mohammed Akub (57), a resident of Tughlakabad Extension, police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/two-auto-drivers-held-for-rape-in-separate-incidents/article37714809.ece

Delhi Congress chief Ch. Anil Kumar said the Assembly session should instead be convened to discuss the city’s dangerous pollution levels and women’s security. “The Delhi Government should immediately give financial compensation to the families of the 700 farmers who became martyrs for the farmers’ cause. Instead, he is blaming the farmers of Punjab for the rising pollution due to stubble burning,” Mr. Kumar said. He added that Delhi Ministers were busy touring other States ahead of elections and had left Delhiites to fend for themselves during an air emergency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/cong-demands-session-on-aqi/article37714808.ece
27 November 2021||New Delhi,||‘No difference between police and prosecutor’||The AAP Government on Friday told the Delhi High Court that on account of the Lieutenant-Governor appointing police chosen lawyers as Special Public Prosecutors (SPPs) for cases related to this year’s Republic Day violence and last year’s riots, there was now “no difference” between the investigating agency and prosecution. Senior lawyers for the Delhi Government told a Bench headed by Chief Justice D.N. Patel, hearing the Government’s challenge to the appointments, that in criminal justice system, prosecutors are “officers of the court” but presently there is “complete synergy” between them and the police. “There is no difference between the police and prosecution today. What is the fairness left in the entire criminal procedure today?” asked senior advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for the Delhi Government. He stated that the appointment of prosecutors was in the domain of the Government and the L-G was bound by the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for the Delhi Government, said that while the matter was of “great urgency”, the respondents — LG and Centre — were yet to file their response.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/no-difference-between-police-and-prosecutor/article37714799.ece

Speaking at a meeting in Jaipur, Mr. Rane, the Minister of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) said he was merely endorsing what the BJP’s Maharashtra unit chief Chandrakant Patil had predicted earlier. “One will be able to see the expected changes in Maharashtra once the BJP comes to power in March,” he said. Asked how he had arrived at this conclusion, Mr. Rane said, “If one wants to topple a government or form a new one, one needs to keep some things secret.” Responding to Mr. Rane’s remarks, Sena leader Anil Parab said the MVA did not run or fall on the former’s predictions and that the ruling alliance would complete its full term.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/mva-govt-will-fall-by-march-next-year-rane/article37714817.ece
27 November 2021||Srinagar,||J&K traders highlight growing losses||Jammu and Kashmir’s trading community on Friday flagged the issue of growing losses before the Finance Department of the Union Territory, weeks after Union Home Minister Amit Shah took a tough position on fresh hand holding in terms of packages to the local industry. An official spokesman said representatives of 12 delegations from Jammu and 12 delegations from Kashmir held a pre-Budget discussion with Finance Commissioner Atal Dulloo in Jammu and highlighted the shrinking businesses in the Union Territory, especially after reading down of Article 370 in 2019. The spokesman said the delegations pointed out that the J&K has suffered economically in the past and business has incurred huge losses, which have also led to unemployment especially since the outbreak of COVID-19. “They demanded special economic packages and conducive atmosphere to give boost to the trade activities,” the spokesman said. The representatives also flagged the issues confronting ailing industrial units, related to finance, banks, electricity, roll back of hike in GST rates applicable from January 2022, comprehensive economic package and release of COVID relief fund. J&K top traders association, Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industries (KCCI), has already submitted an assessment on losses last year to the Union government. It pegged the losses post August 5 security measures in Kashmir at Rs. 17,878 crores, with the agriculture sector topping the list at Rs. 2,827 crore followed by tourism at Rs. 2,615 crore. These losses were further multiplied by the two waves of COVID-19 pandemic. Sources said Union Home M, who was on a three-day visit of J&K in October, had rebuked several local traders and hoteliers who raised the issue of non-performing assets, increasing interest money and losses with him. Mr. Shah had also hinted at hardening of the Centre’s position towards local industry. Traders assured Meanwhile Finance Commissioner Dulloo, who met the traders in Jammu on Friday, assured them that their “valuable suggestions would be taken into account and their genuine grievances would be resolved in a time bound manner”. “The memorandums submitted by various delegations will be examined on merits and genuine issues will be resolved,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/jk-traders-highlight-growing-losses/article37715032.ece
27 November 2021||Paris,||France scraps migrant talks with U.K.||France on Friday scrapped planned talks with the U.K. about migrant crossings after an “unacceptable” letter from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, pushing relations to new lows after 27 people died in the Channel. The anger in Paris was sparked by Mr. Johnson’s decision to send a letter to Mr. Macron on Thursday evening proposing ways to stop migrants crossing from France to Britain, then publishing it in full on his Twitter account. “I am surprised by methods when they are not serious. One leader does not communicate with another on these questions on Twitter, by public letter... No, No,” Mr. Macron told a press conference in Rome. Relations between the two neighbours were already seen as their most tense in decades following a series of disputes over Brexit, but the personal criticism of Johnson represents a further turn for the worse. Analysts say the lack of trust and goodwill will make it more difficult to mount a coordinated response to the growing numbers of people seeking to cross the narrow but treacherous waterway separating the countries. French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin cancelled planned talks with his British counterpart Priti Patel, informing her that she was no longer invited to talks at the weekend with other European Ministers. In a message seen by AFP, Mr. Darmanin told Ms. Patel the letter was a “disappointment” and “making it public made it even worse. I therefore need to cancel our meeting in Calais on Sunday.” ‘Unacceptable’ “We consider the British Prime Minister’s public letter to be unacceptable and contrary to the discussions we had with our counterparts,” added a French source close to Mr. Darmanin, asking not to be named. Mr. Johnson wrote that he had “long been profoundly concerned” about a tragedy in the Channel and “such a catastrophe has now happened” following an accident on Wednesday that saw 27 people drown when their inflatable boat sank. As well as reiterating a request to send British security forces to France for joint patrols — a sensitive issue for Mr. Macron. Mr. Macron also asked France to immediately start taking back all migrants who land in England. The meeting is now set to go ahead without any U.K. presence, prompting London to demand France reconsider the snub.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/france-scraps-migrant-talks-with-uk/article37714294.ece
27 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||India urged to spell out ‘firm policy’ on Tibetan community||With growing concerns in New Delhi about China’s transgressions at the Line of Actual Control and reports of the settlement of villages along it, the leadership of the Tibetan community in exile says it is concerned that China might be “pushing” more Tibetans out to the border areas while using the opportunity to settle more mainland Chinese in Tibetan cities. In addition, according to Penpa Tsering, the newly elected “Sikyong” of the “Central Tibetan Authority (CTA) based in Dharamshala, there is also a need for a strategy to ensure livelihoods for Tibetans living in India, especially in remote and border States. “We hope to send a representation to the Indian government on the overall situation of Tibetans in India, and challenges we face today,” Mr. Tsering told journalists during a visit to Delhi that comes after a detailed tour by him to outlying areas in Ladakh. “We want to ask how India can help us sustain our community, especially those settled in Arunachal, Tawang, in Uttarakhand and in Ladakh. We definitely need more steps — a strategy — a firm policy and the means to cater to the needs of people in the border areas,” he added. Mr. Tsering declined to comment on the current tensions between India and China at the LAC, but said the border aggressions by China denote an “insecurity” within the Chinese government. Mr. Tsering said the CTA, the self-styled Tibetan “Government in Exile”, would also like assistance in completing an authoritative census of the Tibetan diaspora worldwide, so as to be able to better care for their needs. According to informal estimates, about 75,000 live in India and 10,000 in Nepal. The U.S., which has been steadily accepting more Tibetans in the last few years, has about 25,000, while Canada is home to about 10,000, and about 20,000 are based in European countries. Falling numbers When asked, Mr. Tsering said the number of those leaving Tibet has steadily decreased in the past decade, in part due to strict restrictions at the China-Nepal border, and those arriving in India are now down to a small trickle. According to the CTA officials present, about 20,000 Tibetans were enrolled in schools run by the CTA in India and Nepal, which has halved in the past decade to about 9,700. Of particular concern, he told journalists, is that those inside the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) are “losing their culture” as school going children are mandated to learn Mandarin over Tibetan and find employment difficult unless they are schooled in Chinese. “Under Xi Jinping, Chinese authorities are less accommodative of different cultures and languages: they promote ‘One nation, one party, one language, one culture’ now,” he said, adding that as a result, it was even more important for the CTA to promote Tibetan ethnic culture through the diaspora. Talks between the Dalai Lama’s representatives and the Chinese government have not taken place since 2011, after which President Xi came to office with a tougher line on Tibet. Mr. Tsering said while the Dalai Lama and the CTA are open to talks with China, they should be official, not “semi-official” and that he is in the process of structuring a “Permanent Strategy” committee to deal with the question of talks. The CTA is not recognised by any country at present, although many countries support and fund their activities and assist Tibetan refugee communities worldwide. In a statement earlier this month, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin called the government-in-exile an “out and out separatist political group”. “It is against China’s constitution and laws; it is an illegal organisation,” Mr. Wang said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/india-urged-to-spell-out-firm-policy-on-tibetan-community/article37714298.ece
27 November 2021||COLOMBO,||TNA seeks joint U.S.-India role for Sri Lanka political solution||Sri Lanka’s Tamil National Alliance (TNA), the main parliamentary group representing Tamils of the war-affected north and east, has requested the United States to collaborate with India and jointly push for a political solution in the island nation. A delegation led by TNA Jaffna legislator M.A. Sumanthiran, with senior legal experts K. Kanag-Isvaran and Nirmala Chandrahaasan, conveyed this at a recent meeting with State Department officials in Washington DC. “With the U.S. returning to the Human Rights Council, we think it is important that Washington advocates a political solution to the Tamil national question, along with pending issues of accountability and justice,” Mr. Sumanthiran told The Hindu from London, where he is briefing British officials. The U.K. leads a “core group” on Sri Lanka at the Council. In the scheduled March 2022 session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights will present a written report on Sri Lanka. Key interlocutor Until now, India has been the main international interlocutor for a political solution in the island nation that is still recovering from a long civil war, while Western powers have underscored accountability and justice. The TNA’s recent move inviting the U.S. to strengthen the call for an urgent political solution comes amid the Rajapaksa government’s efforts to draft a new Constitution. Its delegation therefore included the senior legal scholars and practitioners who have expertise in the area, according to the TNA MP, himself a lawyer. While in the U.S., Mr. Sumanthiran also met Indian Ambassador Taranjit Singh Sandhu, as well as India’s Permanent Representative to the UN T.S. Tirumurti in New York to brief them about the TNA’s outreach to the U.S. Mr. Sandhu was formerly High Commissioner in Sri Lanka, while Mr. Tirumurti has worked on Sri Lanka-related matters while serving as Joint Secretary in New Delhi. “Washington has kept New Delhi informed of our discussion, and the TNA too held a series of meetings with the Indian High Commissioner Gopal Baglay in Colombo ahead our visit to the U.S.,” the TNA MP said. Since the end of the civil war in 2009, the chief demand of the TNA, especially its leader, the veteran Tamil politician R. Sampanthan, has been a lasting political solution through a just constitutional settlement. The TNA holds the position that the 13th Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution — born out of the Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987 and guaranteeing a measure of power devolution to the provinces — was a necessary step, but is not sufficient, especially with successive governments failing to fully implement its provisions. “Without powers adequately devolved to the provinces, we cannot take on the [State’s] massive plan to change the demography of the Tamil-majority north and east through efforts to settle Sinhalese people and multiple threats to land belonging to Tamils, in the form of archeological or conservation projects,” Mr. Sumanthiran observed. India’s demands India has consistently called for the full implementation of the 13th Amendment and more recently, the early conduct of provincial council elections. However, it is unclear if the Sri Lankan government will hold elections to its nine Provincial Councils before bringing out the new Constitution and electoral reforms that President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has promised.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/tna-seeks-joint-us-india-role-for-sri-lanka-political-solution/article37714300.ece
27 November 2021||HONG KONG,||Hong Kong on alert over two cases of new variant||Two cases of the B.1.1.529 coronavirus variant have been reported in Hong Kong, with the new strain spreading from a traveller from South Africa who was undergoing quarantine to a person occupying the room across from him in a hotel where they were both in isolation. Hong Kong’s Department of Health said genome sequencing revealed that the first patient had come from South Africa while another hotel guest, from Canada, had tested positive for the B.1.1.529 strain five days later. Both travellers were fully vaccinated and undergoing quarantine, which is required for all international arrivals into Hong Kong which is still following a “zero COVID” strategy and has not seen any local outbreaks for many months. Travellers from South Africa, India, the U.S., the U.K and other countries deemed high risk have to undergo 21 days of isolation in a “designated quarantine hotel” in Hong Kong. The new strain, which some experts say may be more transmissible because of mutations, spread within one of the quarantine hotels. The traveller from South Africa, who is 36 years old, landed on November 11 and tested positive on November 15. All travellers undergo tests on arrival and a further six tests during their 21 days of quarantine. The second case was confirmed in the same hotel on November 20. Epidemiological investigations by Hong Kong health authorities revealed that the virus likely spread from one hotel room across the corridor because the first traveller was using an improper mask, fitted with a valve, the South China Morning Post reported. Valved masks to blame Valved masks, health officials said, protect the wearer but allowed infected air to leave and spread across the hotel corridor. The spread likely occurred when the traveller opened his hotel room door to receive a package, which is allowed in quarantine hotels, although residents cannot step out of their rooms. As a precautionary measure, all other residents of the same floor have been transferred to a centralised quarantine facility for a further 14 days of isolation. Health authorities said travellers and those undergoing quarantine will no longer be allowed to wear masks fitted with valves.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/hong-kong-on-alert-over-two-cases-of-new-variant/article37714296.ece
27 November 2021||Tokyo,||Japan to boost spending on air and sea defences||Japan’s Cabinet on Friday approved a 770 billion yen ($6.8 billion) request for an extra defense budget through March to expedite the purchase of missiles, anti-submarine rockets and other weapons amid rising concern over the escalation of military activities by China, Russia and North Korea. The request, still pending parliamentary approval, brings Japan’s military spending for the current year to a new high of more than 6.1 trillion yen ($53.2 billion), up 15% from 5.31 trillion yen in 2020. The Defense Ministry says its “defense power reinforcement and acceleration package” is designed to speed up deployment of some of the key equipment from the 2022 budget request. The goal is to beef up Japan’s defenses against North Korea’s missile threat and China’s increasingly assertive maritime activity around remote Japanese southwestern islands, officials said. Japan has also raised concerns over recent joint military activities by China and Russia near its waters and airspace. A fleet of two Chinese H-6 fighters and two Russian Tu-95s flew from the Sea of Japan to the East China Sea and to the Pacific Ocean, triggering Japanese Self-Defense Force jets to scramble, Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/japan-to-boost-spending-on-air-and-sea-defences/article37714297.ece

27 November 2021||November 27 2021 00:00 IST,||A feel of victory, but fields of discontent||Gurmeet Singh, 73, stands tall at the edge of a concrete sidewalk at the Dhareri Jattan toll plaza in Punjab’s Patiala. It is November 23, a sunny winter day. Gurmeet, clad in the traditional kurta-pajama, cautions a group of farmers gathered around him. The Centre’s assurance that it will repeal the three controversial farm laws is only “a battle half won” for the farmers, he says. Gurmeet exhorts the farmers to continue with their agitation. They should not give up till they get an assured return for their crops, he stresses. Gurmeet has been participating in the ‘ pucca morcha ’ (permanent protest) for over a year now and is determined to continue doing so as he believes that the Centre cannot be trusted. He alleges that a “political game on divisive lines” is being played ahead of the Assembly elections in Punjab, scheduled for 2022. “Some (Bharatiya Janata Party) leaders say that for the sake of unity among different communities — mainly Hindus and Sikhs — the government announced the repeal of the farm laws,” Gurmeet says. “A narrative is being created that a wedge was being developed between communities during the agitation. This is totally false. This is an attempt by the BJP to polarise society before the elections. The truth is that the BJP realised that it would lose the upcoming elections in Uttar Pradesh and in other States as it is not just farmers but other sections of society too that are anguished,” he says. It has been a year since farmers — mostly in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh — gathered at permanent protest sites, many of them at Delhi’s borders, to agitate against the three controversial farm laws passed by Parliament: the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act. They have been demanding that the laws be repealed. After the government’s attempts to convince the farmers about the benefits of the laws failed, on November 24, Prime Minister Narendra Modi apologised to the farmers and announced that the government would repeal the laws. The repeal bill is likely to be tabled soon in the winter session of Parliament. But the farmers are far from convinced about the government’s intentions. Many remain angry, suspicious, and determined to continue with their protest, especially in Punjab, which has emerged as the battleground of the resistance. Distrust in the air Gurmeet reiterates what the farmers have been claiming all along: that the government through the farm laws intended to “sell agriculture to the big corporates”. He says: “People from all sections of society have supported our struggle and have understood the government’s intention. The agitation is being led by people and not by leaders, which is what has made it a success. But let me tell you something: the farmers in Punjab and elsewhere will not forget the brute manner in which the Central government has treated us. Hundreds of farmers lost their lives during the agitation. People will not forget the atrocities of the government. Not just farmers; other people will also not forgive the BJP.” Gurmeet says several attempts were made by some BJP leaders to malign the ongoing agitation by labelling the protesters as “Khalistanis” and “anti-national”. “All this was being done to discredit the movement. When nothing worked in the government’s favour, it began resorting to divide and rule. Its aim is to divert attention from the core issues of the farmers. The primary issue for us is that there is still no law on Minimum Support Price (MSP),” he says. MSP is the price at which the government promises, on paper, to procure agricultural produce from farmers. There are MSPs for 22 agricultural products, primarily grains, pulses and oil seeds, paddy and copra. According to studies, only a small number of farmers benefits from MSPs. Bringing in a law would force the government to procure all the produce that farmers want to sell at the MSP. It is not just the branding of the farmers as “anti-national” by some, but the government’s stubbornness to keep the laws that has led to resentment. A participant in the protest, Amar Singh, says his anger against the BJP won’t go away easily. “I can’t forget the arrogance of the government. It’s only due to its arrogance that the government refused to repeal the farm laws earlier. And hundreds of farmers lost their lives during the one-year struggle. We will persist with our agitation until all our demands are met,” he says. Another farmer, Gurnekh Singh, who has a three-acre farm, says the agitation can have a positive impact on electoral politics, which “will now revolve around farmers’ issues”. Besides the repeal of the farm laws, other demands will take centre stage, especially a law on MSP, he says. “I will only trust the BJP if all our demands are met in writing. Apart from the BJP, even other political parties will now have to seriously think about farmers’ interests — be it the ruling Congress in Punjab or the Shiromani Akali Dal or the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). I think the time has come for farmers to fight elections and work towards fulfilling their demands,” he says. Surinder Pal Singh emphasises that the farmers have remained united throughout the struggle. “The entire world was fighting to save one another during the COVID-19 pandemic. But we were forced by the government’s inconsiderate attitude to fight on two fronts: one against COVID-19 and the other against the government for our demands. Eventually the government had to succumb to our demands and that happened only because people from different sections of society were supporting the struggle,” he says. Surinder also thinks the BJP is arrogant. “Its leaders are not yet publicly ready to acknowledge the strength of the people’s movement. The Centre’s autocratic way of functioning has irked everyone. Now, the government is trying to give the agitation a religious or community-based colour by asserting that the repeal was done to preserve the ‘brotherhood’ of Punjab, which, according to the government, was under threat due to some anti-social elements. The truth is that the agitation has demonstrated how people of various religions, castes and creed are united.” Ranjeet Singh, a local farmer leader, points to an important aspect of democracy that the movement has underlined. People, he says, have started questioning political leaders, seeking answers to various questions, and demanding discussions on issues that affect them. “We will continue to question leaders of political parties, be it the BJP, Congress, Akali Dal or the AAP in Punjab,” he says. “Apart from a law on MSP for crops, we also want the Central government to withdraw the amendments to the Electricity Act, which will only harm the agriculture sector and bring further financial distress to farmers,” Ranjeet says. The farmers will stay on the ground protesting until the other half of their battle is also won, they say. The political fallout The Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC), a prominent outfit at the forefront of the ongoing agitation, and the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan), one of the largest farmer outfits in Punjab, believe that an attempt to play politics with the farmers’ agitation will only backfire. “The government underestimated the magnitude and impact of the agitation, but now ahead of the Assembly elections in various States, especially Uttar Pradesh, the BJP has sensed that the mood of the people is against it. And so, it decided to repeal the laws. Now, in an attempt to save face, the BJP-led government is trying to provide various reasons for the repeal. The repeal is a win for the farmers but the BJP wants to ensure that attention is diverted from its humiliating defeat. During the agitation, several BJP leaders in Punjab and Haryana had to face boycotts and the wrath of farmers on the ground. Now, the same leaders have to cut a sorry figure after the repeal,” says Sarwan Singh Pandher, general secretary of the KMSC. “The BJP is trying to divide communities with an eye on the elections, but the people of Punjab are wise. They can see through this game plan and will not fall for it. By propagating the ‘unity under threat’ message, the BJP is playing a political game to galvanise the support of its core voters,” he says. Sukhdev Singh, general secretary of BKU(U), says it is the unity displayed during the agitation which has “defeated the government and exposed the BJP”. He says, “The government is hatching conspiracies to harm the interests of the farmers and derail the progress and prosperity of Punjab. The BJP’s attempt to polarise society will not work in Punjab. The party will not gain anything politically.” Apart from being branded as “anti-national”, the farmers have been fighting another problem: fake social media accounts. These handles, found to be operating in a coordinated manner, have been actively defaming the farmers and promoting divisive narratives. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of farmer unions spearheading the ongoing farmers’ protests against the Centre’s farm laws, pointed out that these accounts have been suspended across social media platforms. “We are concerned about the divisive agenda being promoted in this manner, and urge citizens to be extra alert about this virtual strategy to pit citizens against each other. The BJP and its supporters have not hesitated to use various strategies to attack the peaceful movement, even as the government went out of its way to suspend and stop the accounts of supporters of the protesting farmers,” the SKM said in a statement. Some hope for the BJP But while many farmers remain angry in Punjab, some see the repeal of the farm laws as a welcome move that could help the BJP in the elections. The party is expected to join hands with former Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s new party, although an official declaration about seat-sharing is awaited. The only irritant in this potential alliance following Mr. Singh’s fallout with the Congress was the farmers’ agitation — Mr. Singh was insistent that the laws be repealed, while the BJP-led government was reluctant to do so. Harnek Singh, 65, who runs a sweet shop at Barkatpur in Fatehgarh Sahib, says the decision by the Centre is welcome. “There is no reason why farmers should not trust the words of the Prime Minister,” he says. Farmer outfits had earlier announced that all legislators and leaders of the BJP, as well as those belonging to other political parties who support the laws, will not be allowed entry into villages for campaigning. In the past few months, there have been several instances, especially in Punjab and Haryana, of BJP leaders as well as leaders of the party’s alliance partners facing stiff resistance by farmer groups. “Now the BJP leaders will be able to visit villages for campaigning. This will eventually help the party in the Assembly election,” Harnek says. In Patiala’s New Grain market, a prominent trading centre, dissent has given way to a more measured response. Harnek Singh, 57, who has come to sell his rice (basmati) crop from Majri village in Fatehgarh Sahib, is hopeful that BJP leaders will now have a chance in the electoral fight. “There is anger but the decision is welcome. If the BJP announces a few more decisions in the farmers’ interest, perhaps it can garner some support. Now, it can think of fighting the elections, which looked like a bleak possibility earlier in the wake of the boycott across the State, especially the rural areas,” he says. While the debate over the political implications of the Prime Minister’s decision and the reasons behind it continues, political observers feel that there is still mistrust of the BJP, which will take time to change. Ronki Ram, Shaheed Bhaghat Singh Chair Professor of Political Science at the Panjab University, says the withdrawal of the farm laws was received positively not only by the farmers but also by traders and landless agricultural labourers. “But at the same time, there is a general perception that the withdrawal is not going to make much difference as far as the farming communities are concerned,” he says. “There is also a common perception that the announcement of the repeal without the government holding any talks with representatives of the various farm unions shows a trust deficit on the part of the ruling regime. This may deeply impact the electoral prospects of the BJP in Punjab,” he says. Pointing out that Punjab is known for its unique syncretic culture, Professor Ram says that the various religions, faiths, sects, beliefs, and diverse cultural traditions in the State are intermeshed so deeply that at times it is difficult to distinguish one from another. “The followers of these various faiths and belief systems resist being pigeon-holed into separate communities. Punjab has been a cradle of diversity. There is harmony among people of different cultures. Traders, primarily Hindus, and landless agricultural manual labourers (mainly Scheduled Castes) also said that these agricultural laws would have long-term negative implications for their business. They said these laws would badly affect their agro-based businesses, too. This is why agricultural commission agents and other traders as well as landless agricultural labourers stood in support of the farmers’ protest. Thus, the question of the alleged communal angle of the farmers’ agitation does not hold any ground,” he says. “The farmer protest movement became a people’s movement in Punjab,” says Pramod Kumar, director of the Institute for Development and Communication in Chandigarh. “The divisive elements remained on the margins. When there has been no division, how can any party benefit from it? Peace and communal harmony continue to remain the mainstay of Punjabi society, which has again emerged strongly in the ongoing agitation. After the repeal of the laws, the urban and semi-urban population may in some constituencies go with the BJP,” he says. The farmers, only partially pacified, are not willing to let go of their demands. All eyes are once again on the government now.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-feel-of-victory-but-fields-of-discontent/article37714292.ece
27 November 2021||November 27 2021 00:00 IST,||A close reading of the NFHS-5, the health of India||The national health and demographic report card is finally completely out. The results from the first phase (conducted between June 2019 and January 2020) of the fifth round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) were released in December 2020. We now have the key results from the second phase (conducted between January 2020 and April 2021). How did India fare? It is a mixed verdict, containing both cheer and alarm in abundant measure. Before going into details, we should note that the results of the NFHS are worthy of our attention because it is not a hastily put together state-of-health index. Together, the two phases provide a detailed, comprehensive, multi-dimensional report card on the state of India’s demographic and health trajectory. Population has stabilised There are many pluses in the report card. A comparison of NFHS-5 with NFHS-4 (2015-16) reveals improvement in several dimensions such as educational attainment, institutional deliveries, vaccinations, infant mortality and much more. We can debate later whether the improvements are good enough given the scale and depth of what needs to be done. For now, we need to appreciate the progress, especially given the abysmal state of India’s health infrastructure, which has been tragically apparent since the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Given how little India spends on health and education as a share of GDP, these improvements are particularly remarkable. The biggest positive headline news from NHFS-5 is that the total fertility rate (TFR), which is the average number of children born to a woman during her lifetime, has been falling over time and is now just below the replacement rate of 2.1. This is true across all States of India. This means that the total population has stabilised. Therefore, politicians can strike one thing off their to-do list and devote their energies to urgent health matters, instead of raising the bogey of population explosion to justify coercive population policies. There is absolutely no evidence to justify tying welfare support measures or holding elected office to the number of children. Data on sex ratio Another headline reveals that nationally, there are 1,020 adult women per 1,000 men for the first time. Does this mean that Indian women are no longer “missing”, i.e. does this signal the beginning of the end of another tenacious problem — that of deep-rooted son preference which leads to illegal but pervasive sex-selective abortions as parents repeatedly try for at least one son? To gauge this, the key metric to examine would be the sex ratio at birth (SRB). The natural SRB is 105 boys to 100 girls, which typically stabilises to a 50-50 adult sex ratio. If there are pervasive sex selective abortions, leading to a masculine SRB (i.e., more than 105 boys to 100 girls), a part of this imbalance would carry forward into adulthood. But adult sex ratio is shaped by many factors other than sex selective abortions. In household surveys, the adult sex ratio might also be affected by sampling errors, arising, for instance, from undercounting migrant males. The natural SRB translates to 952 girls per 1,000 boys. Nationally, the SRB has improved from 919 in 2015-16 to 929 in 2019-21, but it is still short of the natural SRB. Major States with low SRBs are spread all over the country: Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Bihar, Delhi, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Maharashtra. While many States have seen an improvement in their SRBs, some have also witnessed a worsening, e.g. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Odisha. Therefore, we need to recognise that the move to a small family size combined with persistent son preference is likely to impede the improvements in SRB. Anaemia and malnutrition A key health indicator that has worsened is the incidence of anaemia in under-5 children (from 58.6 to 67%), women (53.1 to 57%) and men (22.7 to 25%) in all States of India. Anaemia has debilitating effects on overall health, which is why the World Health Organization characterises it as a serious public health concern; 20%-40% incidence is considered moderate. Indian States show variation: from 39.4% in Kerala to 79.7% in Gujarat: but barring Kerala, all States are in the “severe” category. It is tempting to think of the worsening as the COVID-19 effect. However, comparing the changes in anaemia in Phase 1 States (survey done pre-COVID) to Phase 2 States, we see that if anything, the increase in the former (which include Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Kerala, Maharashtra, West Bengal, among others) is on average higher than the increase in Phase 2 States (Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Punjab, among others). The discrepancy between Phase 1 and Phase 2 could reflect differences in actual incidence or survey-related issues. There are other instances of clear differences between Phase 1 and Phase 2 results. The three indicators of malnutrition: stunting (low height-for-age), wasting (low weight-for-height) and underweight (low weight-for-age): show an overall improvement. These conditions often occur together. Together, these reflect chronic or recurrent undernutrition, usually associated with poverty, poor maternal health and nutrition, frequent illness and/or inappropriate feeding and care in early life. These prevent children from reaching their physical and cognitive potential. However, the overall reduction in national estimates of these three measures masks an anomaly. In Phase 1, several States revealed a worsening in one or more of these, whereas in Phase 2, none of the States showed a worsening. It would be good to understand if the novel coronavirus pandemic affected the survey in Phase 2, leading to undercounting of incidence, or whether by pure chance, all States in Phase 2 happen to be better performers on the malnutrition count (something that could not have been known at the start of the survey in 2019). Also, along with an improvement in these three indicators, we see an increase in the proportion of overweight children, women and men. Being overweight also reflects malnutrition, with serious health consequences in the form of non-communicable diseases. In addition to anthropometric measures, lack of adequate nutrition is also measured by micronutrient deficiencies, i.e. lack of vitamins and minerals that are essential for body functions such as producing enzymes, hormones and other substances needed for growth and development. While the NHFS does not have data on this, the issue of micronutrients is related to diets. It would be good to note here that Indian diets display a rich diversity. Many traditional diets reflect both local climatic conditions as well as a multiplicity of sources of essential nutrients, such as proteins. Policing of diets, by imposing an unnatural uniformity, and preventing access to animal protein for large sections of Indians that are not traditionally vegetarian is likely to reduce micronutrient diversity and contribute to poor health outcomes. Notes of caution Some analyses have suggested that the rate of progress has slowed down, based on comparisons between NHFS-4 and NHFS-5 to the improvements between the two previous rounds. We would not be able to claim this yet, since comparing changes over a 10-year interval (between NFHS-3 in 2005-06 and NFHS-4) to a five-year interval (between NFHS-4 and NFHS-5) is misleading. Some have argued that the poor health outcomes reflect the effect of COVID-19. The data for the second phase of NFHS-5 have been, to a large extent, collected during the highly unusual conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic, but as the evidence on anaemia shows, the deterioration in public health indicators cannot be attributed entirely to the pandemic. COVID-19 might have added fuel to the fire of poor public health, but it did not cause the fire. There is much more in the NHFS-5 survey that needs more than a short piece. The survey focuses on women’s empowerment, autonomy and mobility indicators. It shines a spotlight on women’s reproductive health, and reveals, for instance, that caesarian births have increased dramatically. In private health facilities, 47.5% births are by C-section (14.3% in public health facilities). These figures are highly unnatural and call into question unethical practices of private health providers who prioritise monetary gain over women’s health and control over their bodies. The overall evidence is compelling and clear: health ought to be a matter of concern for all political parties and all governments: national and State. The survey highlights deep inequalities in health outcomes. An action plan to improve India’s health needs to be inclusive, firm in its commitment, and backed by solid resources.

27 November 2021||November 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Indian agriculture needs a Verghese Kurien||Many wish for legendary “Milk Man of India” Verghese Kurien’s presence in our midst today as the conflict between the Central government and the farming community on the issue of the farm laws appears to be still unresolved. November 26, 2021 was also Kurien’s 100th birth anniversary. Kurien’s deep understanding of Indian farming and the trust he earned from the farming community could have helped to find a possible solution to the current crisis. His widely cited observation, that “India’s place in the sun will come from the partnership between the wisdom of its rural people and the skill of its professionals”, captures the essence of his life and mission. There was a time when Kurien seemed to be an improbable architect of a rural revolution that would eventually transform the lives of millions of farmers in Gujarat. There were many who saw him as an outsider to that world. He hailed from distant Kerala, belonged to an upper middle-class Christian family, and was educated in a western university in a subject like metallurgy which is far removed from agriculture. Only as a cooperative model Yet, quietly and with self-confidence, Kurien won the farmers over with his professional integrity and his vision of a central role for farmers in India’s journey of development. It is on that foundation that Kurien went on to design his idea of Amul as a co-operative, turned it over the years into a global brand, and later launched the White Revolution that would make India the largest milk producing nation in the world. It was all a well-knit plan. Central to Kurien’s vision was the co-operative model of business development. He decided that Amul would grow and establish its identity neither as a public sector undertaking nor as a private corporate entity. The co-operative model, he felt, was in the best interests of Gujarat’s milk producers. Kurien had a deep distrust of India’s bureaucracy. He saw it as a leftover of the colonial mindset and the product of a western lifestyle. Equally, he had reservations about the social objectives of the private sector. Much of the corporate sector, he felt, was led more by a profit motive than by public good. Kurien’s fascination for the co-operative model was also influenced by Gandhian thinking on poverty alleviation and social transformation. He viewed co-operatives as the closest embodiment of Mahatma Gandhi’s powerful insight that “what the world needs is not mass production, but production by the masses”. Charting a path and questions Notwithstanding his reservations, it must be said to Kurien’s credit that he saw a great deal — that he could borrow from the ideas and the practices of the corporate world. In areas such as innovations in marketing and management, branding and technology, the private sector excels and sets benchmarks for businesses across the world to follow and adopt. At the same time, Amul was steadily emerging as a laboratory, developing significant innovations and evolving technologies of its own, and these have strengthened its competitive power against multinational corporations. Its biggest success came when under the leadership of H.M. Dalaya, a distinguished dairy engineer, Amul achieved a breakthrough in converting buffalo milk into skim milk powder and condensed milk. It was one single innovation that gave Amul a distinct competitive advantage and profoundly changed the lives of milk producers in Gujarat and beyond. Two questions are central to evaluating Verghese Kurien’s legacy and his contributions to India’s growth story. One, how has Amul performed in the years after its iconic founder left the world in 2012? Second, how far has the cooperative movement in general met its professed objective of an economic transformation at the grass-roots level. Amul has grown steadily on the strong foundation laid by its visionary leader, diversifying its product range and adding new ones. Amul continues to remain one of India’s best-known food brands and is an inspiration to other dairy cooperatives such as Nandini in Karnataka, Aavin in Tamil Nadu and Verka in Punjab. Focus on digital revolution Sadly, Amul’s success has not been the catalyst for similar movements across other agricultural commodities in India. For millions of farmers, life is still a struggle for survival. India’s digital revolution has bypassed the agriculture sector. India talks about smart cities, not smart villages, nor even liveable villages. Farmers’ suicides are not uncommon, weighing heavily on the nation’s conscience. The cooperative movement in India is in a state of flux. It has suffered due to lack of professional management, adequate finance and poor adoption of technology. In the meantime, the pandemic has deepened the urban-rural divide. While the corporate sector is reaping billions on the crest of a stock market boom, incomes are drying in rural India and the nation seems to be facing a grave human tragedy. This is truly a moment to reflect on Verghese Kurien’s remarkable legacy and the unfinished task he has left behind. C.

27 November 2021||November 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Shore up the lifeline||After reports clearly indicated that the States had run out of funds for expenditure on wages and materials for the MGNREGS, the Government announced Rs. 10,000 crore in additional funds as an interim measure. Though allocated on November 5, the scheme’s financial statement as on November 25 still showed a negative net balance of Rs. 9,888 crore indicating that the balance sheets were in the red in 24 States and Union Territories. This means that the fund crunch suffered by the scheme due to high demand and a low budgeted outlay in the Union Budget for this financial year, continues. The high demand is an indication of the extended effects of the pandemic in rural areas, and a continuing lack of funds will hurt any further demand for work in such areas besides of course delaying payments for those who have already completed work. The impact of the lockdowns during the pandemic has continued to depress employment levels and rural wage incomes, which is why the MGNREGS has proven to be a popular avenue for employment and wages. In fact, even during the economic crisis during the pandemic, the rural sector sustained the poor by providing them guaranteed work through the scheme. The delays in payments and the lack of funds have contributed to an estimated unmet demand to the tune of 20% in Bihar, Telangana and Gujarat, according to activists tracking the implementation of the scheme. As the scheme guarantees income for 100 days of work, many households get a reduced number of workdays for which they are paid — a situation that should not be tenable. The budgeting for the scheme by simply fixing a nominal increase from the original Budget estimate in previous years is a flawed method. If anything, the outlay must be tied to revised/actual estimate of expenditure for the scheme each year — in the case of 2021-22, the total allocations were Rs. 73,000 crore, much lower than the Rs. 1,11,500 crore as revised estimates in expenditure in 2020-21. Nearly a quarter of the allocation for the current financial year was also tied to meeting the liabilities from previous years. Clearly, the scheme suffers from a budgeting problem that has hampered its proper implementation despite its popularity, and this needs to be rectified. The Union Government has done the right thing in continuing till March 2022, its free foodgrain ration scheme, the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, that was launched as part of the COVID-19 relief packages — the fourth such extension. This was an acknowledgment of the need for the scheme to support poor families in a recovering economy. Considering that the MGNREGS acts as a robust lifeline as well, it will be prudent for the Government to make up the shortfalls in the allocations quickly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/shore-up-the-lifeline/article37714279.ece
27 November 2021||November 27 2021 00:00 IST,||The rate reset||Since its onset in 2017, the GST regime to subsume multiple State and Central levies was criticised for far too many tax rates that were amenable to creating complications instead of simplifying taxation. The Government had hinted that rates could be reviewed once the system stabilised. Now, with GST in its fifth year, the Government has assessed it is about time to consider a reboot, partly because revenues are falling short of expectations, despite healthy monthly collections. Next month, a Group of Ministers set up by the GST Council is expected to propose changes, including merging slabs, with a road map for immediate, short- and medium-term changes. This mandate marked an expansion of its initially stated task of rationalising tax rates to bolster revenues. To recap, there are eight effective GST rates, including zero on essential goods, standard rates of 5%, 12% and 18% for most goods and services, and a 28% tax plus GST Compensation Cess on sin or demerit goods. Special low rates are specified for jewellery, precious stones and supplies to exporters. The effective tax rate under GST has slipped from the original revenue-neutral rate of 15.5% to 11.6%, which Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said occurred due to rate cuts effected across categories since 2017. Quite a few stemmed from the GST’s hasty beginning and errors in the initial rate-setting. The Council continues to resolve genuine hardships this created for industry segments, but the constant tweaks have also altered the original revenue dynamics envisaged. The 18% tax rate, levied even on insurance premium payments, now accounts for the largest taxable turnover, as a National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP) paper points out. Reducing the 18% rate or merging it with the 12% slab will thus entail revenue losses that would have to be offset by hikes in the lowest and/or highest rates. The NIPFP has suggested a structure of 8%, 15% and a 30% rate for sin goods, to protect revenue concerns while minimising the need for a sharp hike at either end of the spectrum and leaving special rates untouched. This may be less contentious than raising rates on bullion, reportedly proposed to the GoM, which could only spur tax evasion. Sequencing the implementation of new rates and avoiding far-too-frequent rethinks would be critical to minimise disruptions and engender investor confidence. The Council must also urgently address data limitations flagged by the NIPFP. For several months this year, the Government did not reveal returns filed by taxpayers even as it claimed GST collections reflect recovery and improved compliance. Also, many GST rate cuts that triggered the current resource worries were aimed at pandering to regional considerations ahead of critical elections. With key State polls soon, the Government’s resolve to carry out a hard reset on GST rates now may be tested.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-rate-reset/article37714280.ece
27 November 2021||MUMBAI,||Sensex tanks 2.9% on new variant fears||The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex suffered its biggest single-day fall in more than seven months on Friday, slumping almost 3%, as fears of a new novel coronavirus variant that may be possibly vaccine-resistant spooked investors worldwide. The Sensex slid the most since April 12, plunging 1,687.94 points, or 2.87%, to close at 57,107.15. Twenty six of the 30 index members declined with IndusInd Bank (6.01%), Maruti Suzuki (5.27%) and Tata Steel (5.23%) leading the losers. Drugmaker Dr. Reddy’s, however, gained 3.32%. “The bears were in control from the beginning as a new variant of [the virus that causes] COVID-19 raised concerns globally and they further tightened their grip as the session progressed,” said Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking Ltd. “Though COVID is not new to the market, the reaction is largely in response to the news of a different variant while the U.S. and Europe are already struggling,” Mr. Mishra added. Hotel and airline stocks plunged with InterGlobe Aviation Ltd., parent of budget airline IndiGo, sliding 8.81% and Indian Hotels Co. declining 11.1%. “The way markets have closed on Friday, we expect more pain in the coming sessions,” said Mr. Mishra, adding that apart from the global COVID-related updates, investors would also be eyeing domestic data like GDP numbers and auto sales for cues in the coming week. U.S. stocks, oil slump The Dow dragged Wall Street’s main indexes lower, with travel, bank and commodity-linked stocks bearing the brunt of a sell-off triggered by the discovery of the new variant, Reuters reported. United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines slumped almost 10%. Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors fell in early trading, with energy sliding 6.3%. Oil prices dived about 6%, hitting a two-month low on fears the variant could dampen economic growth and fuel demand. Brent crude fell $5.40, or 6.5%, to $76.82 a barrel by 1452 GMT. Global stock markets sold off sharply after reports that the new variant was detected in South Africa, with scientists saying it has an unusual combination of mutations, may be able to evade immune responses and could be more transmissible. “This could be the moment that people look back on as derailing the economic recovery and rate rises but what we have is a big insertion of uncertainty rather than something material,” said Peter Rutter, head of equities at Royal London Asset Management. “The very fact we don't know is what’s concerning the market,” he added.

Ramesh said, announcing the bank is extending a $250-million credit line for Africa to procure the vaccines. Much of the $100-million loan had been disbursed and the rest would be issued by March, he said, adding that only a few firms were making vaccines or related products in the country. On the credit line, Mr. Ramesh said the India Exim Bank has offered $150 million to the African Exim Bank and $100 million to Africa Finance Corporation. “They can use it for any imports from India, but I think their need is vaccines,” Mr. Ramesh told media here on Friday. “Without the credit, they would not have that kind of money to import vaccines. They will be repaying over a period of time,” he said, adding there were similar requests from many other countries.

27 November 2021||MUMBAI,||RBI raises private bank promoter stake cap||The Reserve Bank of India has raised the long-term cap on promoters’ stakes in private sector banks, allowing them to hold 26% instead of the 15% in force currently. Accepting 21 of the 33 proposals suggested by a panel, the RBI said that the remaining 12 — including a contentious suggestion to allow corporate houses to operate private banks — were ‘under examination’. “The cap on promoters’ stake in [the] long run of 15 years may be raised from the current levels of 15% to 26% of the paid-up voting equity share capital of the bank. This stipulation should be uniform for all types of promoters and would not mean that promoters, who have already diluted their holdings to below 26%, will not be permitted to raise it to 26% of the paid-up voting equity share capital of the bank,” the RBI said. “The promoter, if he/she so desires, can choose to bring down holding to even below 26%, any time after the lock-in period of 5 years,” the central bank added. The RBI has also doubled the initial paid-up voting equity share capital/ net worth required to set up a new universal bank, to Rs. 1,000 crore from the current Rs. 500-crore norm. An Internal Working Group was set up last year to review the ownership guidelines for private banks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/rbi-raises-private-bank-promoter-stake-cap/article37714262.ece

27 November 2021||Bali,||Sindhu fights her way into semis||India’s two-time Olympic medallist and World badminton champion P.V. Sindhu rallied from a game down to beat South Korea’s Sim Yu-jin 14-21, 21-19, 21-14 and enter the semifinals of the Indonesia Open Super 1000 tournament here on Friday. The men’s doubles duo of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty later beat Malaysia’s Goh Sze Fei and Nur Izzuddin 21-19, 21-19 to also make the semifinals. However, B. Sai Praneeth lost 12-21, 8-21 to Olympic champion and former World No. 1 Viktor Axelsen of Denmark in the quarterfinals. Third seed Sindhu will play second seed Ratchanok Intanon of Thailand next. Tough going It was not smooth sailing for Sindhu. She started confidently, racing to 7-1, but Sim negated all that and won the game comfortably. Sindhu upped her game in the second. Sim fought backbut Sindhu drew on her vast experience to draw level. In the decider, Sindhu held the initial advantage and survived a fightback by the Korean to seal the match.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sindhu-fights-her-way-into-semis/article37714269.ece
27 November 2021||KANPUR,||Young and Latham defy India after Shreyas completes century||Some coincidences are without precedence. The one noticed here during Friday’s play could well be one of a kind. Consider this: Shreyas Iyer was batting on 75 and Ravindra Jadeja, on 50 when the action resumed on the second day of the India-New Zealand Test. At stumps, Will Young was batting on 75 and Tom Latham, on 50. What more, the first Test for Shreyas is also the first Test, in India, for Young. Between the two moments at the opposite ends of the day’s play, New Zealand frustrated India like no other visiting team in recent times. It restricted the host to 345 and then made the total appear strikingly inadequate by scoring 129 runs without loss. In short, it performed like a true World Test champion and made India look a distant second best. Special innings The domination of the Kiwi openers also pushed into the background a special 105 from Shreyas on debut. Ten days short of turning 27, the Mumbai batter added 30 runs this morning with six boundaries before becoming one of Tim Southee’s five victims. When India resumed at 258 for four, Southee bowled 11 overs on the trot to go with the one bowled on Thursday evening. During this impressive spell, he scalped Jadeja, on his overnight 50, Wriddiman Saha, Shreyas and Axar Patel in the space of 37 deliveries to finish with five for 69. After lunch, Ajaz Patel quickly took the remaining two wickets, including that of an impressive R. Ashwin (38, 56b, 5x4) to leave the Indian think-tank wondering whether 345 was adequate on this placid pitch. Most impressive Young was the most impressive batsman on view today. A top-order-batter-turned-opener, Young made it to this playing XI only because Devon Conway missed the Tour due to injury. Having scored an impressive 82 in his previous Test at Birmingham against England, Young missed the WTC final against India. On this day, Young showed his comfort against the spinners. Though Ajinkya Rahane used 16 overs of pace and 41 of spin to break the stand, Young was equal to the challenge. Showing the right mix of defence and offence with good use of this feet, Young not only hit 12 boundaries but rotated the strike well. At the other end, Latham’s wicketkeeping experience came to the fore as he appeared to have read the pitch well. The left-hander swept with the ease of a veteran, more against the left-arm spinners — Jadeja and Axar — and hit just four boundaries in all. In the absence of any noticeable assistance from the pitch, the bowlers did rather well to keep the flow of runs in check. On what turned out to be an ordinary day’s work for the on-field umpires Nitin Menon and Virender Sharma, referrals to the TV umpire saved Latham three times and Young once. Three leg-before appeals were upheld after failing to see the ball hitting the inside-edges of the bat.  They got off to a good start obviously, but it’s important for us to not leak runs because the cracks are opening up and it should get trickier tomorrow.

Guus Jansen was the other scorer for the winning side. Borja Lazalle and Pau Cunill led Spain’s challenge. Germany also posted a hard-fought win by an identical margin to take three points against Argentina in a Pool D contest. Matteo Poljaric, Benedikt Schewarzhaupt and Hannes Muller scored for Germany.

27 November 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Seraha outlasts Pranathi for women’s title||Alappuzha’s Seraha Jacob found her touch at the nick of time to tame a fighting Pranathi P. Nair of Thiruvananthapuram and claim the women’s singles title in the Bank of Baroda-State table tennis championships at the Jimmy George indoor stadium here on Friday. The tussle between the two unseeded players went down to the wire and when it appeared the Thiruvananthapuram girl was gaining an upper-hand in the decider, taking a 6-3 lead, Seraha fought back brilliantly to deny her rival. The Alappuzha girl finding that Pranathi could stand herself well in a fast, attacking game, changed her tactics to slow down and this forced the latter to a series of unforced errors before Seraha won 11-5, 9-11, 11-3, 4-11, 8-11, 11-8, 11-8. Pranathi also failed to rise up to her top billing in both the under-19 and under-17 sections. In the under-19 final, she lost to Reeva Anna Michael (Alappuzha) 5-11, 8-11, 9-11, 3-11, while in the under-17 title round, she was blitzed by Edwina Edward (Kollam) 11-6, 7-11, 8-11, 8-11, 8-11. Edwina completed a double by taking the under-13 title as well with an easy 11-4, 10-12, 11-4, 13-11 win over Tia S. Mundenkurien (Thrissur).  Other results:   Women’s singles: Semifinals: Seraha bt Aswani Rajan (Alp) 11-4, 11-7, 11-5, 11-7; Pranathi bt Reeva Anna Michael (Alp) 11-5, 7-11, 11-5, 18-16, 7-11, 11-4, 11-9.

27 November 2021||November 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Carlsen, Nepo sign peace in opener||World champion Magnus Carlsen and challenger Ian Nepomniachtchi tested the waters for 45 moves before settling for a draw in the first encounter of the best-of-14-game World chess championship match in Dubai on Friday. The first game, where Nepo opened with white pieces, ended after a three-fold repetition of moves. Following the opening lines of Ruy Lopez, Carlsen's decision to sacrifice a central pawn on the ninth move injected some interest. . Soon, commentating on the game, five-time world champion Viswanathan Anand said, “White is a pawn up but look at this pawn structure. It is not the easiest pawn structure to use an extra pawn. Black probably has very good compensation.” The early exchange of queens kept the position in balance. The players did not look surprised by moves pulled off by their rivals. At times, Carlsen appeared to be in a position to seize control. But Nepo stayed sharp and precise in his choice of continuation. Finally, Nepo returned the extra pawn on the 36th move. Before long, the players repeated the moves and signed peace. In the post-game press conference, Carlsen said he was not “particularly optimistic in terms of winning the game” but generally happy with the ideas he found over the board. Nepo was magnanimous in acknowledging the “fine game by Magnus.” The second game, where Carlsen plays white, is scheduled for Saturday.  The moves: White: Nepominachtchi; Black: Carlsen   1. e4 e5 2.

27 November 2021||GUWAHATI,||Time to invest in sportspersons: Bhutia||Sportstar hosted the first-ever North-East Sports Conclave here on Friday, with a host of speakers from different sports disciplines identifying vexing issues in the region and ways to handle them. Dr. Himanta Biswa Sarma, Chief Minister of Assam, shared his vision for sports development. “We have also sanctioned Rs 1,000 crore for further developing sports infrastructure in this fiscal year – the highest-ever allocation for the state – and work has already started in many projects.” Anurag Thakur, Union Minister of Information & Broadcasting and Youth Affairs & Sports, delivered the keynote address virtually. Mizoram Sports Minister Robert Romawia Royte said better infrastructure is key to the success of all sports in the North-East. "Infrastructure-wise, the gap [compared to other states] is still very wide," said Royte. While football continues to be a popular sport for North-East, Meghalaya is also home to skilled archers. Asked what Meghalaya is doing to promote other sports, AIFF vice-president Larsing Ming Sawyan said: “There is an integrated indoor stadium which will have multiple sports. There is an input of Rs. 300 crores towards sports infrastructure.” Tokyo 2020 Olympic medal winners — weightlifter Mirabai Chanu (silver medallist) and boxer Lovlina Borgohain (bronze medallist) — also shared their journeys. “Even now, many parents don't allow their daughters to play sports. I would tell them sports has a big future and you can make a career out of it,” Lovlina said. Mirabai, on her part, spoke about the drug problem among today’s youth. "I request you all to think of your lives and families, and turn over a new leaf. Please do not use drugs. Think of your State, your village and your family. If you try, you will succeed.” Meanwhile, in a panel discussion on the North-East becoming the sports hub of India, former Indian football captain Bhaichung Bhutia reiterated the need to invest in athletes. “It is time to invest in sportspersons, not just infrastructure. In North-East football, the efforts are from individual organisations or people... there’s no support from the States. Today, when you play I League and ISL, you get a good salary package. It’s unfortunate that other sports in India, besides cricket, don’t give such financial benefits.” Manjusha, DGM Sports, Indian Oil, concurred with Bhutia. “A lot needs to be done to get talent at the district- and village-level. That’s where the power of sport lies. Infrastructure alone can’t give champions; a structure can. Track talents from rural areas and bring them to the city.” The Conclave was held in association with the Directorate of Information and Public Relations Assam, IOC, SBI and LIC India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/time-to-invest-in-sportspersons-bhutia/article37714371.ece
27 November 2021||KOCHI,||Bino George has some unfinished business||Coach Bino George has some unfinished business in the Santosh Trophy. He had guided Kerala to the top of its qualification group after big wins over Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh but the final phase in Mizoram last year never happened owing to the coronavirus pandemic. With the National championship at home this time, the head coach is keen to make it memorable. “It’s a big responsibility since the matches are in Kerala. And since we have players who have been with I-League and ISL sides, I would say our chances are good,” said George, Kerala’s only AFC Pro License coach, in a chat with The Hindu on Friday. “But it all depends on the day’s performance.” With Puducherry, Lakshadweep and Andaman and Nicobar, Kerala appears to be in a weak group in the South Zone qualifiers but George feels it could also be a tricky situation. “It is comfortable to play against a team that plays well. But if you look at teams like Lakshadweep or Puducherry, there is no planning, no system. They (players) will just be continuously running, that team will be difficult,” he explained. “They can be dangerous, I respect all teams. But we need to win the trophy.” The current team is better than last year’s side, feels George who is also the Kerala United FC’s head coach. There are eight Kerala United players in the 22-member Kerala team and George realises that it could raise a few eyebrows. “People will think that since I’m with Kerala United, so many United players are in the team. But only because they are good they got into Kerala United,” he said. “They were already with Gokulam and Blasters, Kerala United signed them to play in the second division I-League.” KFA secretary P. Anilkumar added his bit. “That was the only (Kerala) club playing in the second division national league so it recruited almost all the best players,” he explained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bino-george-has-some-unfinished-business/article37715038.ece
27 November 2021||November 27 2021 00:00 IST,||East Bengal looks to nail its first win||It’s that time of the Indian Super League (ISL 2021-22) when the famed Kolkata derby comes around! SC East Bengal will gun for its first win under new coach Manolo Diaz when it locks horns with its city rival ATK Mohun Bagan at the Tilak Maidan Stadium in Goa. The two sides have made contrasting starts to the season — SC East Bengal showed plenty of promise but was forced to settle for a draw with Jamshedpur FC, while ATK Mohun Bagan brought its A-game to the fore and stormed to a 4-2 triumph over Kerala Blasters. Need for tight defence Diaz’s side will need to be watertight in defence to contain the dangerous ATK Mohun Bagan attack, which features the likes of Roy Krishna and Hugo Boumous. “For me, the whole squad of ATKMB is a threat. Yes, Hugo and Krishna are good players who can score goals, but one or two players can’t win you a match. The team has to perform well collectively to win. So we’re making plans to stop the team instead of focusing on individuals,” said Diaz. The former Real Madrid-B team coach added, “Our focus will be on minimising mistakes, having a strong structure, and capitalising on the weak points of ATKMB. We must be compact, give good, secure passes, and create opportunities in the attacking half because it becomes difficult if we’re defending the whole time.” SC East Bengal lost both its games against ATK Mohun Bagan last season and Diaz is keen to snap the losing streak. “I know it is only our second official match of the season, but we don’t want to come up with any excuses. We know ATKMB is a good team and is helmed by an able coach who has experience in the ISL, but we will try to do our best,” he said. Greater intensity ATK Mohun Bagan coach Antonio Habas, the only manager to have won the ISL title twice, has demanded greater intensity from his side. “We have to be more ambitious. In the second half of our last match, we weren’t as comfortable as we would like when they scored. We have to play the match with the same intensity for 90 minutes,” he said. Considering all the history and iconic duels between the two teams, the Spaniard quipped, “The past doesn’t matter. We want to win the match and give 100% respect to the opponent.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/east-bengal-looks-to-nail-its-first-win/article37714777.ece

27 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Yuvan stuns top seed Dahiya||Yuvan Nandal played robust to beat top seed Aman Dahiya 6-4, 6-1 in the semifinals of the ITF grade-4 junior tennis tournament at the DLTA Complex on Friday. Having lost rather tamely to Aman in their last meeting in a similar tournament in Chandigarh in March, the talented Yuvan was itching to assert his strong game. Aman looked unprepared to tackle a quality opponent and was unhappy with himself for his erratic game. In the singles final, Yuvan will play second seed Max Batyutenko of Kazakhstan who laboured to a three-set victory against Monil Lotlikar. In the girls section, Shruti Ahlawat set up a title clash against Vaishnavi Adkar. Aman did have the consolation of winning the doubles title in partnership with Rushil Khosla. The Kazakh girls Erkezhan Arystanbekova and Zhanel Rustemova were fluent in winning the girls title against Shruti Ahlawat and Ruma Gaikaiwari.  The results: Boys (semifinals): Yuvan Nandal bt Aman Dahiya 6-4, 6-1; Max Batyutenko (Kaz) bt Monil Lotlikar 6-3, 3-6, 6-2; Doubles (final): Aman Dahiya & Rushil Khosla bt Max Batyutenko & Artur Khairutdinov (Kaz) 7-5, 3-6, [10-8]; Girls (semifinals): Shruti Ahlawat bt Erkezhan Arystanbekova (Kaz) 6-2, 6-3; Vaishnavi Adkar bt Suhitha Maruri 6-2, 6-0; Doubles (final): Erkezhan Arystanbekova & Zhanel Rustemova (Kaz) bt Shruti Ahlawat & Ruma Gaikaiwari 6-2, 6-3 .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/yuvan-stuns-top-seed-dahiya/article37714781.ece
27 November 2021||November 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Mumbai eyes another dominant show||Following a dominant 3-0 win over FC Goa in its season-opener, Mumbai City FC will look to dish out another performance worthy of the defending champion tag when it meets Hyderabad FC at the Fatorda Stadium in Margao on Saturday. In what will be the first-ever late kick-off in the ISL, with the match scheduled to begin at 9.30 p.m., Des Buckingham’s men will look to display the same verve they did against Goa by pressing high and attacking relentlessly. Angulo shows his worth Forward Igor Angulo showed what he was capable of by scoring a brace. For a side that lost proven strikers in Adam Le Fondre and Bartholomew Ogbeche from the title-winning side, it was a shot in the arm. Hyderabad coach Manolo Marquez, looking for his first win over Mumbai, will be wary of this threat as he tries to overcome an early blip that Tuesday’s 1-0 defeat to Chennaiyin FC was. The side can ill-afford to be as wasteful as it was against Chennaiyin and Marquez will hope that Ogbeche, now at Hyderabad, will soon start troubling defenders. The Mumbai defence, led by skipper Mourtada Fall, is expected to be much tighter than a depleted Goa’s, but the fact that Buckingham’s side plays an expansive style similar to Hyderabad’s may lead to an open game with ample goal-scoring opportunities. Mumbai will miss the services of wingback D. Vignesh, who will be out for up to six weeks following an ankle injury against FC Goa.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mumbai-eyes-another-dominant-show/article37714778.ece
27 November 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||India eyes quarterfinal spot||Defending champion India will take inspiration from its big win over Canada and look forward to registering another comprehensive win over Poland in its last Pool B match of the men’s hockey Junior World Cup at the Kalinga Stadium here on Saturday. After being stunned 5-4 by France in its opening match, India fought back to thrash Canada 13-1 in its next engagement. Now the host, placed second in the pool with three points, needs to beat Poland in order to reach the quarterfinals smoothly. Top two sides from each pool will make it to the knockout stage. Poland, which has three points as well, will hope to upset India’s plans even though it will be a tough task for the European team. Helplessness Chief coach Graham Reid understood India’s helplessness well. “We can’t do anything about that now (defeat to France). If we have to win back-to-back titles, we will have to beat every team henceforth. “We will not like to think ahead of us, we have a match against Poland before that and that’s what we will be thinking about. We have to win that before we think about the next stage,” said Reid. Reid looked at the positives. “It is a learning experience for the boys. Every match is one experience. That’s what I have always been telling the senior players as well.”  Among the positives, the home team will take heart from its fighting spirit that helped it reduce the margin against France in the closing minutes. Besides, India’s penalty corner conversion has been impressive. Vice-captain Sanjay, who has scored two hat-tricks, Araijeet Singh Hundal, who has also scored a hat-trick against Canada, and Shardanand Tiwari provide a lot of options to the side in penalty corner attack. The home team will also take confidence from its improved coordination and rhythm against Canada and will try to improve it further in the forthcoming matches.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-eyes-quarterfinal-spot/article37714779.ece
27 November 2021||BENGALURU,||No bio-bubble for Tata Open 2022||The Tata Open Maharashtra in Pune has returned to the tennis calendar of 2022 on the back of an assurance from government authorities to the ATP that there will be no forced quarantine of international arrivals. The 2021 edition was not held because the Maharashtra govt. was not agreeable to the above demand. Tournament Director Prashant Sutar told The Hindu on Friday that players who are vaccinated need not quarantine and those not vaccinated will need to take RT-PCR tests on arrival. “There will be no bio-bubble. If a player tests positive, only that player will be isolated in his own hotel room and not the close contacts,” Sutar said. This will align the tournament with the Premier League model where the bubble has been done away with keeping in mind the toll that it takes on players’ mental health. Sutar also expressed confidence that there will not be any visa restrictions as travel into India had eased significantly. “There will be a maximum of 500 spectators allowed per day and they have to be double-vaccinated. But there will be no player fan engagement,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/no-bio-bubble-for-tata-open-2022/article37714609.ece

27 November 2021||Chittagong,||Liton, Mushfiqur rescue Bangladesh with big stand||Liton Das scored his maiden Test century as the Bangladesh wicketkeeper and Mushfiqur Rahim helped rebuild after a top-order collapse in the first Test against Pakistan on Friday. At stumps on day one, Bangladesh was on 253 for four in its first innings, with Liton unbeaten on 113 and Mushfiqur 82 not out. Opting to bat, the home team was in trouble at 49 for four before the duo turned the tide with a 204-run unbroken fifth-wicket stand. Liton led the charge, hitting 11 fours and hoisting off-spinner Sajid Khan over long-on for his only six in the innings. He struck left-arm spinner Nauman Ali to bring up his 10th Test fifty before Mushfiqur followed suit, his 24th in Tests, with a four off Hasan Ali. Liton completed his maiden Test hundred with a cheeky single off Nauman Ali.  The scores: Bangladesh 253/4 in 85 overs (Mushfiqur Rahim 82 batting, Liton Das 113 batting) vs Pakistan; Toss: Bangladesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/liton-mushfiqur-rescue-bangladesh-with-big-stand/article37714272.ece
27 November 2021||Chennai,||Venkataramana — making actions speak||M. Venkataramana does not talk much. But, when he does, he speaks sense. Tamil Nadu’s new coach, who began his tenure with a triumphant Syed Mushtaq Ali Tournament (SMAT) campaign is a quiet, back-room man who gets things done. Talking about the team, Venkataramana told The Hindu , “I see teamwork and togetherness. The boys are helping each other out, discussing strategies. They have been transparent in accepting mistakes and are not afraid to air opinions.” Pat for Sai Kishore Among the highlights of Tamil Nadu’s SMAT triumph was left-arm spinner Sai Kishore’s bowling. Venkataramana said: “He’s always thinking about the game. Meticulous preparation is one of his assets. He’s adapted to the shorter format.” But then, Venkataramana was unwilling to judge a spinner based on Twenty20 performance. “The thinking is different in the shorter version. To judge a bowler, you have to see how he comes off in every session of a First Class game. How his body holds up and his consistency during long spells.” Venkataramana was pleased with the stock of left-arm spinners in the State. “M. Siddharth is as good as Sai. He’s aggressive, skilful and combative. Ajith Ram is also a good prospect.” Talking about off-spinners, Venkataramana said, “Yazh Arun Mozhi has potential. I see some improvement in Aparajith’s bowling. Washington can lock one end and pick up wickets on his day.”  On wrist-spinners, Venkataramana wanted M. Ashwin to adjust to the duration games, lending the attack another dimension. On the electrifying last-ball-six finish in the SMAT final, he said, “We should have finished the chase in the 18th or 19th over, slowed up in the middle phase.” On Shahrukh Khan, Venkataramana said, “He’s got good bat speed. Knows his strengths, puts pressure on bowlers.” Sai Sudharsan also oozes talent, he said.  Venkataramana was confident about Tamil Nadu’s prospects in the upcoming Vijay Hazare one-day tournament. “We have tremendous white-ball players. The return of Dinesh Karthik and Washington Sundar makes us stronger.” Winning the Ranji Trophy is the ultimate goal. “We have to first find the core group.” Venkataramana is on the job.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/venkataramana-making-actions-speak/article37714688.ece
27 November 2021||CHENNAI,||TN women’s football league from Dec. 1||The Tamil Nadu women’s State football league will be held from December 1 to January 22 at the Nehru Stadium here. Six teams — Sethu FC, SDAT Excellence, Tamil Nadu Police, Thamizhachi FC, Minerva FC and Wow Women — will play each other twice in a home-and-away format. The winner of the league will participate in the Indian Women’s League (IWL) tentatively scheduled in Odisha in March 2022. The IWL couldn’t be held last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “The football ground [Nehru Stadium] is getting spruced up. A special thanks to the Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu’s member secretary R. Ananda Kumar for making it happen. We will not be having a match every day, but after a two or three-day gap,” Seeni Mohaideen, Tamil Nadu Women’s Committee chairman told The Hindu here on Friday. Organic growth Speaking about the growth of women’s football in the State in the last couple of years, Seeni said the sport had grown organically. “Our efforts paid off when the State junior girls’ team won the National championship, and the State women’s team won the senior Nationals, both in 2018.    “Earlier, we used to have one player in the Indian women’s team, now we have four: K. Indumathi, N. Sowmya (goalkeeper), A. Karthika, and B. Mariyammal. Tamil Nadu women’s football is looking up,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tn-womens-football-league-from-dec-1/article37714690.ece
27 November 2021||GUWAHATI,||Lovlina aspiring to turn professional||Tokyo Olympics bronze medallist Lovlina Borgohain on Friday said she wants to take up professional boxing in the near future. “It’s my dream to do well as a professional boxer. There aren’t too many Indian women in professional boxing. So, I want to leave a mark there as well,” Lovlina said on the sidelines of Sportstar ’s North-East Sports Conclave. “But I want to win an Olympic gold at Paris 2024 first,” she added. Lovlina, the third Indian boxer to win an Olympic medal, said there have been a slew of changes in her home town since her Tokyo heroics. “A new stadium is coming up, so that’s great news for all the kids in my area. There has been an influx of kids, so much so that we are wondering where to train them till such time the stadium is ready. So, if one medal can usher in so much change, imagine what a medal glut could do to Assam,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/lovlina-aspiring-to-turn-professional/article37714366.ece
27 November 2021||November 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Valskis does it for JFC||Nerijus Valskis broke a nine-match goalless run to strike a brace and marshal Jamshedpur FC to a 3-1 win over FC Goa at the Athletic Stadium in Bambolim on Friday. FC Goa goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh, who was named in the 2021 AFC Champions League Team of the Season, made a string of stirring saves to deny Valskis and Len Doungel in the opening half. The second half, though, was a different story. Valskis got into the act, scoring a goal in the 51st minute. The 34-year-old drilled a low shot past Dheeraj to put his side ahead and returned to torment the Gaurs defence exactly 10 minutes later as he leapt beyond his marker to nod home Greg Stweart’s inch-perfect free-kick. Things only went from bad to worse for FC Goa as Jordan Murray, who came on in the 80th minute, scored within seconds of his introduction to triple Jamshedpur's lead. Staring at a second successive loss, FC Goa threw the proverbial kitchen sink with the hopes of a late comeback. Bedia hit the woodwork and Airam Cabrera scored in the 86th minute but it was too little too late. Owen Coyle’s Jamshedpur withstood the late pressure to claim only its third win in nine games against FC Goa.  The result: Jamshedpur FC 3 (Valskis 51 & 61, Murray 80) bt FC Goa 1 (Cabrera 86).   Saturday’s matches: SC East Bengal vs ATK Mohun Bagan (7.30 p.m.); Mumbai City FC vs Hyderabad FC (9.30 p.m).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/valskis-does-it-for-jfc/article37714374.ece
27 November 2021||GUWAHATI,||Thakur all praise for North-East’s efforts||Anurag Thakur, India's Sports Minister, has lauded North-East’s efforts to better the sports ecosystem in the region. “The fact that we have a sports conclave for North-East speaks a lot about the progress of these states in sports. It is a testament to the emergence of sporting excellence in NE states," Thakur said during his keynote address at Sportstar's first-ever North-East Sports Conclave in Guwahati on Friday. "After our performance at Rio 2016, we set up a dedicated Olympic cell to focus on excellence. Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) was started in 2016, wherein all sorts of supports have been taken care of by the central government. "We are in the process of setting up an infrastructure dashboard where we have all information about sporting infrastructure in each district. Geo-tagging of sporting infrastructure will allow governments to spend judiciously and do targetted projects in under-served areas." Asked how he planned on introducing professionalism to the day-to-day workings of state sports federations, Thakur said, "I would like to take a friendly approach - just handhold where they need central government's help. Make them realise that if they perform well, our sports will do well. It is the national sports federations and state associations who have to pick players and organise events." About whether the Tokyo 2020 tally met his expectations, he said, "We expected more medals from rifle shooting, wrestling and boxing. But we will do better at Paris 2024."||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/thakur-all-praise-for-north-easts-efforts/article37714381.ece
27 November 2021||GURUGRAM,||Ishaque surprises top seed Sidharth||Ishaque Eqbal thrived on the pace and bounce of the court to subdue top seed Sidharth Rawat 6-4, 7-6(2) in the quarterfinals of the $15,000 ITF men’s tennis tournament at the Tennis Project, Baliawas, on Friday. Playing on a wild card, and having lost to Sidharth in the first round last week, Ishaque was the underdog. Yet, when it came to competing hard, the 23-year-old Ishaque was second to none. He did miss a few match points on Sidharth’s serve in the 10th and 12th games of the second set, but fired his only ace in the match to signal victory in the tie-break. In the semifinals, Ishaque, who hits the ball on the rise with uncanny efficiency, will play the left-handed Zsombor Velcz of Hungary, who knocked out fourth seed Manish Sureshkumar in three sets in a tough contest that lasted two-and-a-half hours. Manish fought back from being down 1-4 to par in the third set, but could not sustain it any further after saving four match points in the 10th game. Nitin Kumar Sinha did not look short of energy as he beat Nicolas Tepmahc of France after losing the first set and trailing 0-3 in the second. Nitin served seven aces and converted five of 16 break points.

27 November 2021||Sydney,||Cummins is Australia Test captain||Australia named paceman Pat Cummins its Test captain and Steve Smith his deputy on Friday after a sexting scandal led Tim Paine to quit the post last week, just ahead of the Ashes. Dramatic day On a dramatic day for Australian cricket, the Cummins appointment came hours after it was announced that former captain Paine would take a break from the sport, ruling him out of the home Ashes series against old rival England. Cummins becomes the 47th captain of the Australian men’s Test team while Smith returns to a key leadership role, having been forced to stand down as skipper for his part in the 2018 ‘Sandpaper-gate’ ball-tampering scandal. Cummins, 28, is the first fast bowler to lead Australia since 1956. After Paine’s downfall for sending lewd text messages, Cummins knows that there will be intense scrutiny of his behaviour on and off the field, especially with the Ashes starting on December 8 in Brisbane.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/cummins-is-australia-test-captain/article37714602.ece

27 November 2021||November 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Leos Carax and his singing baby puppet||Leos Carax, the 60-year-old French filmmaker who has made a total of six feature films in a career spanning 40 years, is perhaps one of the most polarising, peculiar filmmakers of our times. From Boy Meets Girl (1984) to The Lovers on t he Bridge (1991) to Pola X ( 1999) and Holy Motors (2012), it’s nearly impossible to summarise or even neatly define what his films really are about. After the world premiere of Holy Motors at the Locarno Film Festival in 2012, I once made the mistake of asking him what the film was about, really. To which, Carax, his eyes covered with sunglasses as usual, turned around and said, “I have no idea. You tell me?” This time, I decided not to repeat that mistake. Working with Adam Driver His most recent film, Annette, which premiered on Mubi on November 24, takes him outside of Europe, straight into Hollywood’s abode, Los Angeles. It’s a strange, melodramatic musical about an aggressive comedian Henry (Adam Driver) and a celebrated opera singer Ann (Marion Cotillard) who fall in love, like movie stars of yore would, and give birth to a baby girl, Annette. Standard fare? Except that the baby girl here is a wooden doll and nobody seems to notice that. Eventually, as Henry spends time tending to Annette, and Ann’s star continues to rise, the inevitability of marital rift ruptures their relationship and the couple spiral into uncontrollable darkness. The film won Carax the Best Director award at Cannes this year. Carax, a recluse, didn’t attend the closing ceremony.  Annette marks a departure for Carax, from a language as well as a casting perspective. Nearly all his films, barring Pola X and now Annette , feature Denis Lavant, arguably one of cinema’s most versatile actors. Arriving at a decision to do this film without Lavant wasn’t difficult, Carax says, over a video call from Paris. “It’s a singing film in English with a younger character. Denis wasn’t fit for the role. I was lucky to work with Adam,” he says, pointing out that he was drawn to Driver’s physicality and his ‘monkey-like’ spirit after watching him in Lena Dunham’s Girls.  A melancholic musical, Annette’ s songs have been composed and written by Ron and Russell Mael, popularly known as the Sparks brothers, who’ve also been credited for the film’s screenplay. But if the pop-and-rock duo co-wrote the film, Carax found himself working on the film’s songs. “I had to make them mine. And luckily, because we weren’t getting the money, we had a lot of time. Seven years, actually!” Of props and comedy While there are several ways to interpret what the wooden baby signifies — from it being the media’s obsession with covering celebrity children to it being a telling sign of the way Henry looks at women (as puppets) — Carax has a rather straight-forward explanation. “It would be impossible to find a child that age who sings. It wasn’t something I wished to do. But it came to me in a flash and then I had to imagine the whole film around this baby. Over time, we all got attached to the puppets. The final challenge was to also find a real-life five-year-old who can confront her father but then, like the film says, miracles do happen.” In the film, Driver’s Henry has a volatile relationship with the audience. He uses comedy as an outlet for his angst, at times even humiliating the audience members. But he also seeks out their validation as a means to assert his power. Carax’s protagonists often appear to be proxies for himself. While he certainly doesn’t have a hostile equation with his patrons, he does have a complicated relationship with them. “The more viewers you have,” Carax says, “the easier it is for you to make films. I’m conscious of that. When I was younger, I’d say, I wanted to make films for dead people. It’s hard to say who I make films for. Annette has so many layers of reality and unreality, you end up thinking, will people accept this? That’s unavoidable.” Carax says he cannot reverse-engineer a movie to suit the taste of his audience. Instead, he says, “You put your doubts, your fears, your questions into the film. Imagining yourself as a bad father is interesting.” An unapologetic provocateur, Carax has had a tough time making films in Europe, a cinema culture generally perceived to be a thriving ground for avant-garde and experimental filmmakers. Annette is his first English film and that too with actors who’ve enjoyed mainstream Hollywood popularity. “In the 90s, I couldn’t make too many films because of my reputation. At times, it was due to lack of money. And many times, it was because I couldn’t cast my films. Even if I could make all the films I possibly could, I wouldn’t have made four to five more films. That’s my rhythm I suppose.”   Art, at what cost? Carax mentions that the films that have influenced and shaped his own filmmaking are Guru Dutt’s Pyaasa and Kaagaz Ke Phool, both films about artists enduring personal pain in the pursuit of creation. Does he endorse that romanticised notion of great art coming at the cost of personal turmoil, something that’s not at odds with the overarching theme of Annette ? “Yes. I’m very inspired by Guru Dutt. Whether through their characters or through their own lives , their films spoke about self-destructive power. Usually men, almost always men, self-destruct while trying to create, live and love, and not being able to create, live, or love.” Annette is streaming on Mubi.

27 November 2021||November 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Margazhi 2021: where does the season go from here?||Rehearsals are in full swing at Alarmel Valli’s home in Kilpauk. The Bharatanatyam artiste is readying to record a performance that will premiere on January 2 (kicking off the 15th edition of The Music Academy’s Dance Festival under the umbrella of its 95th annual conference, which begins on December 20th). In Chennai, across auditoriums and cultural institutions, artistes are either busy recording performances that will unfold online or organisers are applying the final coat of paint to spaces that have remained shut for over 18 months. For Valli, this recording is a first; transitioning from performing to a live gallery to audiences that will watch it online, whenever, wherever, on their devices. It also underlines how different this Margazhi feels — like the fading away of an era, of a certain magic. “There’s a sadness in me,” she says, reiterating how the calendar of her life, right up to the onset of Covid-19, was measured, in a sense, from December to December, one Margazhi to another. (Incidentally, she’d debuted at The Music Academy when she was 15, a space she says is charged with the collective energies of thousands of artistes and rasikas ). “It [Margazhi] was an intense period of enrichment in my growth as an artiste.” Though going digital has helped the arts and artistes sustain themselves over the last year, and amplified its reach across the globe, she observes, “In the process, I feel the intensity and uniqueness of the experience has been diluted.”  A khichdi in December  After a year-long hiatus from all things live, the annual festival of music and dance is beginning to make its presence felt, in varied forms, sizes, formats and possibilities. Having tasted digital blood, and its dizzying possibilities in terms of reach and interaction — Yours Truly Margazhi, for instance, a month-long festival of music and dance, sold 3,500 subscriptions and had between 5,000 to 15,000 views per day from across the globe — Margazhi 2021 is trying to retain its core sensibilities while unfurling as a bespoke experience. The question is: has it lost a bit of its sheen? “The word that comes to mind is khichdi ,” says Ramanathan Iyer, founder of the arts platform The ARTery. “I think the digital re-creation, with a smattering of half-baked in-person experiences, has exacerbated the many problems that already existed in the festival. Such as the same artistes performing at venues close to each other, resulting in a scattered audience and ticket sales. The online model was a great opportunity for reform, but it hasn’t been so [the same artiste is now popping up at the same time across two digital festivals]. What we need urgently is for artistes and organisations to come together and deliberate on the way forward.” This season, while some organisations are sticking with the digital format, others are going the opposite direction, and a few are toying with both (a virtual festival combined with short, in-person experiences). “I’d say it’s a bit of a hotchpotch,” says N Murali, president, The Music Academy. “We made a decision in August that we’d stay digital this year as well. What we have done is expanded our festival’s contours. For instance, our music festival is spread across 12 days [as opposed to eight last time]. We have also included lec-dems and a three-day dance festival. In the shooting and recording of these performances, we have tried to re-create the live experience digitally as much as possible.” Just back from Mumbai, Anita Ratnam says over a phone call, “As a dancer, I hope organisations that are curating digital festivals have re-imagined it and ensured they have raised the bar in terms of the camera and editing work. I hope the camera person has spent some time watching the dancer in rehearsal, attempting to understand the dance before capturing it.”  The joys of in-person shows  With the government giving a go-ahead for live performances a few days ago, a host of sabhas are curating truncated festivals, conscious of social distancing and other Covid-19 protocols. Hari Krishnaswami, secretary, Narada Gana Sabha is looking forward to welcoming audiences from December 17 to 31, for two programmes a day in his 1,200-seater auditorium (that will also house a canteen to dish out the much-awaited sabha saapaadu ). “People are waiting to watch performances live,” he says, adding that he isn’t expecting NRIs; most of the audience will be locals and perhaps a few from across India. Saashwathi Prabhu, CEO, Krishna Gana Sabha (KGS), is readying to open the auditorium for its 65th Margazhi Mela, which will unfold as an in-person experience for 15 days (December 15 to January 1). Opening with a dance performance by Srinidhi Chidambaram and concluding with one by dancer-actor Shobana, and with competitive pricing (tickets between Rs. 200 and Rs. 2,000), KGS is looking to fill its nearly 800-seater auditorium. The festival will also have a new restaurant doling out ‘tiffin’ items. “Artistes and audiences revel in the synergy that occurs during a performance; this is the innate trait of the classical arts,” says Prabhu. “We are hoping to re-create that magic, in a smaller, more manageable format.” However, some young artistes are still undecided about how they’d like to engage with the festival. Amrit Ramnath, an upcoming musician and Bombay Jayashri’s son, feels this over abundance of content, especially during Margazhi, can lead to a saturation of sorts. “This will, I’m sure, push for a new kind of change. I’m looking forward to that paradigm shift in the way we consume a live concert. And the variables may include duration, format, number of elements, structure of a concert.”  The way forward  But digital is where much of the attention is focussed now. The hybrid model has undoubtedly nudged artistes and organisers to think out-of-the-box while filming concerts. Classical musician Sandeep Narayan tells me how his friends in the US were impressed by the photos he shared over WhatsApp from a recent recording for the Federation of City Sabhas. “With elaborate sets unlike what you’d find in a typical kutcheri , and high-quality microphones [Rover 121, Neumann KMS 105, and Sontronics Sigma], everything was top notch,” he says. “The Margazhi festival has a stigma of being too traditional, but with everything being curated consciously now, the visual aspect is more deliberate.” In a sense, the recordings have meant that, at least for the artistes, Margazhi has arrived early. Does this potpourri, however, mean that there’s a threat of it becoming a mere milestone that just happens to coincide with a specific time of the year? “It’s the difference between something actually happening between December and January versus something that we create for a festival,” says classical musician Vignesh Ishwar, who has recorded five online concerts and has two live gigs for this season. All this leads me back to the point Valli had raised — about how the uniqueness of Margazhi is getting diluted. At her home by the sea in Valmiki Nagar, Malavika Sarukkai acknowledges the overall noise that pervades the world of the arts, but says she is excited to just dance. “Would I miss an audience when I record? Am I looking forward to performing to a live audience? Do I practise differently for each of these programmes? The answer is I wouldn’t change the way I do things; I am rehearsing with the same intensity,” says Sarukkai, who is recording for The Music Academy’s festival and will perform live at KGS. “These permutations and combinations we are attempting are all a part of the natural process of evolution. After we get through this, it is imperative to discuss what is important in dance and what we want to say through it, which will, in a sense, pave the way for the next 20 years.” Amen to that.  “Through the pandemic, I worked on a bunch of singles that I intend to put out as an album next year. I also intend to record a classical concert on my own, of myself, for the Margazhi season. It will be a shorter format because I don’t think that online consumption of classical music is possible beyond 20-30 minutes.” — Amrit Ramnath, musician||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/margazhi-2021-where-does-the-season-go-from-here/article37714546.ece

Denis wasn’t fit for the role. I was lucky to work with Adam,” he says, pointing out that he was drawn to Driver’s physicality and his ‘monkey-like’ spirit after watching him in Lena Dunham’s Girls.  A melancholic musical, Annette’ s songs have been composed and written by Ron and Russell Mael, popularly known as the Sparks brothers, who’ve also been credited for the film’s screenplay. But if the pop-and-rock duo co-wrote the film, Carax found himself working on the film’s songs. “I had to make them mine. And luckily, because we weren’t getting the money, we had a lot of time. Seven years, actually!” Of props and comedy While there are several ways to interpret what the wooden baby signifies — from it being the media’s obsession with covering celebrity children to it being a telling sign of the way Henry looks at women (as puppets) — Carax has a rather straight-forward explanation. “It would be impossible to find a child that age who sings. It wasn’t something I wished to do. But it came to me in a flash and then I had to imagine the whole film around this baby. Over time, we all got attached to the puppets. The final challenge was to also find a real-life five-year-old who can confront her father but then, like the film says, miracles do happen.” In the film, Driver’s Henry has a volatile relationship with the audience. He uses comedy as an outlet for his angst, at times even humiliating the audience members. But he also seeks out their validation as a means to assert his power. Carax’s protagonists often appear to be proxies for himself. While he certainly doesn’t have a hostile equation with his patrons, he does have a complicated relationship with them. “The more viewers you have,” Carax says, “the easier it is for you to make films. I’m conscious of that. When I was younger, I’d say, I wanted to make films for dead people. It’s hard to say who I make films for. Annette has so many layers of reality and unreality, you end up thinking, will people accept this? That’s unavoidable.” Carax says he cannot reverse-engineer a movie to suit the taste of his audience. Instead, he says, “You put your doubts, your fears, your questions into the film. Imagining yourself as a bad father is interesting.” An unapologetic provocateur, Carax has had a tough time making films in Europe, a cinema culture generally perceived to be a thriving ground for avant-garde and experimental filmmakers. Annette is his first English film and that too with actors who’ve enjoyed mainstream Hollywood popularity. “In the 90s, I couldn’t make too many films because of my reputation. At times, it was due to lack of money. And many times, it was because I couldn’t cast my films. Even if I could make all the films I possibly could, I wouldn’t have made four to five more films. That’s my rhythm I suppose.”   Art, at what cost? Carax mentions that the films that have influenced and shaped his own filmmaking are Guru Dutt’s Pyaasa and Kaagaz Ke Phool, both films about artists enduring personal pain in the pursuit of creation. Does he endorse that romanticised notion of great art coming at the cost of personal turmoil, something that’s not at odds with the overarching theme of Annette ? “Yes. I’m very inspired by Guru Dutt. Whether through their characters or through their own lives , their films spoke about self-destructive power. Usually men, almost always men, self-destruct while trying to create, live and love, and not being able to create, live, or love.” Annette is streaming on Mubi.

27 November 2021||November 27 2021 00:00 IST,||What’s in a location?||The property market always sees increased buying activity during the festive season. The positive sentiments of the season motivate buyers to stop procrastinating. Obviously, developers know this and go to great lengths to harness the festive sentiment. There are usually multiple special offers rolled out for property buyers during this period. While festive offers can be tempting, property buyers need first to understand the genuine value of a property. Buying real estate should be based on this true value alone. So, what is ‘true value’ in a property? It is not a matter of resale value. The real value of a property is its happiness quotient. Remember, you will be using this property for many years. For you, the real value lies in how much joy, security, convenience, and overall wellbeing it can give you for as long as you live there. You have heard that the three most important value drivers in real estate are ‘location, location and location.’ What does this mean? Most people think in terms of the future resale value of a property in a particular location. By this yardstick, the most expensive locations are the most ‘valuable’ locations. But actually, they are just the costliest locations — and usually anything but happy. Paying a massive price for a cramped tiny home in an expensive location will not buy you happiness. In cities like Pune, many of the costliest locations are also the most congested and polluted, and prone to crime. They are costly because they are so jammed full of older properties that no further development is possible. These are actually dying locations, and the price you pay is for scarcity and perhaps resale value, not for your happiness. Which kind of location can make you happy? A complete list of factors would be exhaustive, but let us look at five of the most important ones in the current Indian context:  1.Accessibility and convenience: First of all, it should give you access to everything you need. Shopping and grocery outlets, basic entertainment and transport facilities, schools, and hospitals should be available. Convenience is a significant factor that influences happiness — if you must struggle to get to work, get your kids to school, and buy whatever you need, you will not be happy there.  2.Space and spaciousness: The second most crucial factor that influences happiness is space. Not only should your property itself be spacious, but there also needs to be enough space between buildings. Your window view should not be of the wall of another building. Open spaces have a direct correlation to health, happiness, and wellbeing. If you live in a small flat in a congested, noisy neighbourhood, you will not be happy regardless of how much you paid for the home.  3.Vibrancy or ‘vibe’: This is an intangible factor, but there is a vast difference between a young, vibrant neighbourhood and an aged, dying location. To understand whether a locality is on the way up or down, simply take a walk or slow drive around the residential and commercial areas. What is the average age of the buildings you see? Are the roads well-kept? Do you get an overall feeling of end-of-life and decay, or a thriving, well-managed neighbourhood?  4.Planning and organisation: The human mind needs organisation. Lack of organisation and planning is intensely distressful to us, and we should not see signs of it around our homes. One sign that a neighbourhood is intentionally well-planned is the uniform design of its buildings. If there is a considerable disparity in building designs, the location’s development did not follow a blueprint and took place haphazardly. Consider the state of the roads, too. If its roads are poorly maintained, the locality is not considered very important by the municipal authorities. If this is the case, you should not be surprised if the area also suffers from water shortage, frequent electricity supply interruptions, and other disruptions.  5.Safety: We cannot be happy if we do not feel safe, and unplanned areas with a vast disparity in living standards are not secure. In many of our cities, the costliest locations are surrounded by squalor and poverty and usually have a high crime rate. The safety of an area is again a factor of good planning. While a developer can introduce many safety features in his project, he can’t do anything about the surrounding areas. Integrated townships are so popular in India because they offer all these benefits — accessibility, space, vibrancy, and a high degree of planning and safety. Integrated townships are mini-cities that have been designed based on a master plan. The best townships have beautiful aesthetics, are centrally maintained, enjoy high-level security, never face shortages, and offer generous green, open spaces. The level of happiness you can get from a home in an integrated township does not depend on the township’s location — the township itself is the location, a self-contained world where everything is impeccably designed, planned, spacious, safe, and within reach. Needless to say, the importance of these qualities has also been hugely amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Not surprisingly, the interest in integrated townships has never been higher than in the festive season of 2021. More and more Indians are discovering that the hunt for an ideal home ends when they visit a township created by a developer who understands this format perfectly. Homes that make us happy are the best investment we can ever make.  The writer is chairman, Pharande Spaces.   Convenience is a significant factor that influences happiness — if you must struggle to get to work, get your kids to school, and buy whatever you need, you will not be happy there||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/whats-in-a-location/article37714550.ece
27 November 2021||November 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Well done, Chandigarh||A new study using Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revealed that India has secured five of the top 20 happiest cities in the world to buy a home. Online Mortgage Advisor used an AI facial recognition tool to scrape over 3,00,000 geotagged pictures on Instagram to analyse emotions displayed by people buying a home around the world on their social media. We looked specifically at happiness levels in the faces in every photo, which allowed us to rank the most and least happy locations in the world for homebuyers. The key findings reveal the following: India is home to five of the top 20 happiest cities to buy a home in the world — Chandigarh (5th), Jaipur (10th), Chennai (13th), Indore (17th), and Lucknow (20th). Chandigarh came up as the fifth happiest city in the world to buy a home, with new homebuyers there 13% happier than the global average. Mumbai is the least happy city to buy a home in the world and Surat is the fifth least happy in the world. Happy cities Using the same approach as above, we found that India dominates the top 20 happiest cities to buy a home in the world, with a quarter of the list located in India. Barcelona in Spain was the highest-scoring city in the world with 15.6%, followed by Florence in Italy with 15.45, and Ulsan in South Korea with 14.4%. Chandigarh is the highest scoring city in India with homebuyers 13% happier than the global average. Least happy India features on the bottom 20 list twice. First, Mumbai ranks the unhappiest in the world with 17.1%. Surat scored fifth unhappiest in the world with homebuyers 12.8% less happy than the global average.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/well-done-chandigarh/article37714548.ece

27 November 2021||November 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Ten ways to make neon welcome||They are electrifying, intense, and powerful. Fluorescent neon colours never fail to grab the eye, and can be counted upon to inject excitement, energy, and verve wherever they are used — on paper, in apparel, in makeup, and in home design. Neon colours are extremely bright and pigmented versions of basic primary and secondary colours, such as blue, red, yellow, green, and purple. What makes them standout choices is the fact that they emit light, which makes them luminescent. Any shade of neon can work in the home, if styled well. Be it chartreuse, lime green, pink, magenta, red, teal, saffron, flamingo, cyan, scarlet, or violet, they can all be part of the trend. Add brightness and cheer to your spaces by working through these tips and a neon colour or two. 1.In the bathroom Minty toothpaste or citrus smells to wake you up? Why not equally zesty colours, then! Buy a set of toothbrush holder, soap dish, and soap dispenser in neon colours. If you think the colour scheme of your bathroom is subtle, the contrast will be gorgeous. 2.On the furniture You don’t have to make your room look like a nursery! But only a set of neon chairs will work wonders at adding a splash of exciting colours to the décor. Or spray paint on just the lower half of the legs of the table or stool and see the magic! 3.On the linen & textiles Neon bed covers, pillow and cushion covers in solids and patterns look ooh la la! If you don’t want to go overboard then invest in neon throws, an odd curtain or alternating curtains in neon. It will add a nice little pop of colour to the room. 4.With buntings & accessories You’ve probably seen them at parties. These are cute garlands that hang on walls. Make it a DIY project. Get neon-coloured papers or cardboard and cut different shapes — flowers, butterflies, stars, or animals, whatever you like and make a garland for a bare wall. 5.On planters and pots A two-tone, neon stripes or polka dots will make planter pots look so pretty. You can get spray paint and colour the pot good at the bottom. Colourful flowers and neon at the bottom. Two much! 6.On a door or accent wall Go bold with the entrance or make a wall of fame. Just one neon element in an otherwise understated room will make it stand out. Get your guests’ attention as soon as they enter that front door. 7.With neon candles The most inexpensive way to add neon to your décor! Place the candles by the wall on candle stands or leave them as centerpiece or on the mantle, they will look great. 8.With ribbons and tapes Just a dash of neon on everyday objects will make them appear so attractive. Here’s another super inexpensive yet surefire way to brighten the décor up. Wrap neon ribbons around things such as decanters or cover a plain vase or pen stand with neon sticky tape. 9.With neon edging Make plain boring wooden boxes come to life. Paint just the edges of the box and see how it looks striking instantaneously. Or else cover cardboard boxes with neon paper. 10.Through lighting fixtures Forget traditional accent lights. There are LED glow signs available. There are Love, guitar, moon and whatnot that you can look for. If you are the experimental type, get neon light wires and make something yourself. Neon colours are not what you would call classic, which is why no designer would suggest going all out with fluorescents. But bring the dazzlers home to jazz up your living space or bathroom. Just a hint of a neon colour can liven the whole room up!||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/ten-ways-to-make-neon-welcome/article37714562.ece
27 November 2021||November 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Reinventing Maximum City||Towards the beginning of the pandemic, redevelopment in Mumbai had switched to the slow lane. Lack of capital and construction manpower and a seriously compromised construction materials pipeline were only one side of the problem. Another dampener was the fact that government offices were functioning erratically at best — and redevelopment in a city like Mumbai required the granting of countless permissions and clearances. Of late, with all these bottlenecks opening up once more, redevelopment projects in Mumbai may begin picking up pace again. There are no real alternatives — the biggest problem for real estate development in the city is land scarcity. There are very few opportunities for greenfield developments in the more valuable city centre areas. As such, redevelopment projects are often the only option for developers keen to have projects in such areas, where demand exceeds supply. Types of redevelopment Not all redevelopment opportunities are created equal. There are basically three kinds of regular redevelopment models — slum redevelopment, cluster redevelopment, and redevelopment of four or five or even one old housing societies. Of these, most developers would prefer the kind involving old societies since the original owners are in manageable numbers, and it is easier to get a consensus. However, these are not the meatiest redevelopment opportunities in Mumbai. In fact, industrial-to-residential redevelopments are far more lucrative. Here, there are relatively fewer stakeholders involved, the proposition is more or less straightforward, and the redevelopment can yield a sizeable number of residential units. Also, many such industrial units are debt-ridden and may therefore be available on distress sale directly from the financiers. In Mumbai, a good example of such industrial-to-residential redevelopment involves defunct mill premises. Cluster redevelopments, on the other hand, are a lot more complicated because larger numbers of stakeholders whose buy-in needs to be obtained are involved. The hardest and, in most cases, the least preferred variant is slum redevelopment. Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) projects involve countless numbers of stakeholders and government departments, apart from often vested political interests. At any given time, redevelopment is a big deal in a metropolitan city hemmed in by the sea on three sides. The acute shortage of available land in the core parts of Mumbai has compelled the city to expand northwards into adjoining districts of Navi Mumbai, Thane, and Raigad, and the peripheral suburban locations along the central and western rail network. Obviously, the most lucrative redevelopments happen in the most valuable central areas where land prices are astronomical and profit margins huge. Redevelopments in the suburbs are far less attractive, and they don’t need it as much as the central areas. The Dharavi project Talked about for years with no progress on the ground, the Dharavi slum redevelopment project falls in a prime locality between BKC and the Lower Parel. If the state government, town planning authorities and developers ever do manage to cut through the massive Gordian Knot that has this project tied up, it will result in a massive supply infusion. Residential projects there will naturally cater to high-end property buyers. With the applicable FSI there, there will be enough left for luxury housing projects after the rehabilitation of existing hutments. With an FSI of 4 instead of the usual SRA ceiling of 2.5, the Dharavi redevelopment project can indeed be a truly world-class development — and extremely lucrative for all involved stakeholders. In the redevelopment plans that have been submitted as of date, Dharavi has been broken down into 10 distinct sectors, each to be tackled by selected developers. This will mean that the developers would need to consider the current market for retail, commercial and residential development, and also the usage mix of the other sectors. The involved developers will have to study each catchment by its own merits, based on their own market studies and their own business models. When the Dharavi redevelopment project finally gets underway, the five identified sectors — at an average of 70 acres each — are likely to feature mixed developments. The time frame for completion will probably be between 8-10 years. The property prices in and around Dharavi in areas such as Sion, Chembur, etc. are currently around Rs. 25,000 – 30,000 per sq.ft and once the Dharavi redevelopment project completes, property rates could easily see a 30-40% upside as lot of new supply will be added in the high-demand market. Dharavi’s redevelopment will be a one-off thing — something that happens only every 50 years or so in any particular city. As a result, nothing compares to it on the domestic level. Other major urban rejuvenation drives have taken place in countries like Singapore; however, these are purely urban rejuvenation projects and have nothing to do with slum redevelopment. The Dharavi redevelopment project would also create waves in the retail sector. Apart from the favourable development mix, Dharavi has a sufficient population in the SEC ‘B’ and ‘C’ sectors that use it as a launchpad to better lifestyles. This population component will definitely be a tailor-made market for value retail in the form of hypermarkets and discount stores. At the same time, on Dharavi’s peripheries, Dadar, Wadala, Bandra, Ghatkopar, Sion, and Chembur will also contribute to Dharavi’s advantage, and vice versa. Bombay chawls project While Dharavi’s redevelopment is still more or less science fiction as of now, other redevelopment projects in Mumbai are happening in the here and now. For instance, the redevelopment of the Bombay Development Department (BDD) chawls is now underway. It has been long due as the structures are in a precarious condition and are unsafe for occupancy. Currently, there are over 195 such tenements spread across 87 acres of prime South Mumbai in Worli, Naigaon, and Parel. Worli currently has the highest share of such structures, covering an area of 60 acres and houses over 12,000 families. These dilapidated structures once housed migrant mill workers and now occupy prime real estate locations in the city. Redevelopment at such a scale — in prime South Mumbai locations — will free up precious land and give a genuine fillip to the real estate sector in the city. South Central Mumbai currently accounts for 1-5% of the total housing supply in Mumbai and is primarily driven by the luxury and ultra-luxury segments. Unlocking large land parcels will open new development avenues in the region, enabling growth across various asset classes. The prevailing prices in these prime locations of South Mumbai are between Rs. 35,000 and Rs. 40,000 per sq.ft., particularly in the micro-markets of Worli and Lower Parel. Prices here have remained stable for over a year despite the rise in input costs. However, the infusion of new supply at such a magnitude will probably cause some downward ripples on the pricing front. Affordable housing Over the last few years, most of the supply in MMR has been in the affordable segment — in fact, 30-44% of all new housing in MMR has been in this category. Almost all of this new affordable supply has come up in the suburbs and peripheral regions — none in the core parts of the city. In the post-pandemic period, there is a noticeable shift towards mid-segment housing as residential demand now favours more functional homes which can accommodate WFH and e-schooling in times of such disruptions. While the continued migration of workforce across various socio-economic strata does create a need for housing in Mumbai, we are unlikely to see much —if any — budget housing resulting from Mumbai’s redevelopment projects.

27 November 2021||November 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Real estate after five years of demonetisation||The impact of demonetisation, compounded by RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Authority), GST (Goods and Services Tax) and other reforms, has disrupted India’s real estate market severely. On a positive note, the pouring of unaccounted capital into the real estate sector has become virtually impossible. The future growth in the sector will be based on much more credible and sustainable principles than ever before. In the post-RERA era, all the property transactions today are already taking place on the basis of transparent cheque payments and legal online payment gateways. Direct tax collections From a consumer’s perspective, the influx of liquidity in the system has ensured attractive home loan rates which are at their lowest in almost a decade. Owing to the ongoing transformation, developers have also been offering attractive rates and payment plans to draw potential buyers.   Real estate industry experts share their views on demonetisation on its fifth anniversary:   Pritam Chivukula, Co-Founder & Director, Tridhaatu Realty, and Hon. Secretary, CREDAI MCHI, says, “An important goal of demonetisation was to reduce the use of cash in transactions and inspire people to pay using non-cash modes. The real estate industry has welcomed this move towards the positive side since it helped the sector to increase the direct tax collections. This has brought a large number of evaders into the tax net. It has indirectly made things more systematic, accountable and transparent.” Kaushal Agarwal, Chairman, The Guardians Real Estate Advisory, believes that the sudden and initial impact of demonetisation over the economy was severe and real estate was the worst hit sector. “However, today I feel that it was a much-calculated move by the government to streamline the economy and bring transparency in key sectors. It has prevented the inflow of black money and nearly wiped-out the unorganised players. More importantly, it has paved the path for corporate and listed companies to expand and grow, which in other cases was tilted in favour of local and unorganised players. Demonetisation has also increased the awareness about digital payments and online transactions amongst home buyers. This has drastically helped the sector to eradicate the age-old menace of illicit transactions and dubious sales.” As for Himanshu Jain, VP - Sales, Marketing and CRM, Satellite Developers Private Limited (SDPL), “Just like the COVID-19 pandemic, initially we thought that demonetisation would affect all the major industries including real estate. But the move has created a positive impact and the real estate industry has done better in the last five years. Demonetisation has led to a level playing field in many sectors including real estate.” Cashless economy Vedanshu Kedia, Director, Prescon Group, adds, “The move has had an impact on the perception of real estate transactions. All the three major objectives of curbing black money, fake notes and most importantly creating a cashless economy have been achieved as India has become one of the largest markets for digital payments. After demonetisation, a large share of the population has gone digital and have adopted cashless transactions. There are many proptech startups now that are working on creating platforms that allow homebuyers to experience property and make a block on their inventory by committing an expression of interest. This will definitely enable ease of doing business and bring liquidity to the real estate market.”  The real estate industry has welcomed this move towards the positive side since it helped the sector to increase the direct tax collections. This has brought a large number of evaders into the tax net||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/real-estate-after-five-years-of-demonetisation/article37714564.ece

27 November 2021||Mumbai,||Congress, BJP reach agreement on two seats in Council polls||In a rare incident of mutual agreement with the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government to avoid what could have become one of the costliest Council polls in recent times, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership on Friday withdrew its candidate from the Kolhapur local body council seat clearing the way for Congress candidate and State Minister Satej Patil’s unopposed victory. In return, the Congress withdrew its candidate from Nandurbar-Dhule local bodies seat paving the way for the victory of BJP’s Amrish Patel. With this, winners on four of six Legislative Council seats have been declared unopposed. Two seats in Mumbai have already gone to Sunil Shinde (Shiv Sena) and Rajhans Singh (BJP). In Kolhapur, the top State leadership of both Congress and BJP arrived at the agreement mutually amid reports of exorbitant demands from the voters, corporators and councillors of local bodies from both candidates. ‘Monetary demands’ “There were demands of Innova cars from these voters, irrespective of party affiliations. There were monetary demands as well. When it was clear that the whole election was growing out of proportion, it was mutually decided to work out an arrangement,” a source closely associated with the election process in Kolhapur told The Hindu. He said the expenditure from both sides on this single seat alone could have touched Rs 100 crore. In the remaining two Council seats, Nagpur will see a direct contest between former minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule (BJP) and Ravindra Bhoyar (Congress), a former BJP veteran. In Akola-Washim-Buldhana local bodies seat, Gopikishan Bajoria (Sena) will take on Vasant Khandelwal (BJP). This seat has been with the Sena for four terms when the party was in alliance with the BJP. This is for the first time that both the parties will contest against each other. The election for these two seats will take place on December 10 and the counting on December 14.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/congress-bjp-reach-agreement-on-two-seats-in-council-polls/article37715031.ece
27 November 2021||Patna,||AAP will come out as strong option for people of Bihar, says Sanjeev Jha||On the foundation day of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Bihar incharge Sanjeev Jha on Friday said his party would define “patriotism and nationalism”. Mr. Jha also took on the “double engine” Government in Bihar and said the AAP would come out as a strong political option in the coming days. Mr. Jha took on Chief Minister Nitish Kumar-led “double engine” Government on several counts and said more migration had taken place during this regime than the previous RJD’s. ‘Pathetic scenario’ “The educational scenario is so pathetic that even residences of Vice-Chancellors are being raided. Bihar lags far behind other States in important sectors like education, health, employment, industry, and law and order,” alleged Mr. Jha amid loud cheers from party workers. “It’s been 72 years since we’ve adopted our Constitution but the big question is whether it is as much relevant as it was or it has been chained in politics by leaders for their own convenience because today most of the parties are involved not in the country’s interest but to fulfil their own political interests. The aim of the Aam Aadmi Party is to implement the Constitution for the people. The AAP will define patriotism and nationalism for people,” said the MLA from the Burari Assembly constituency in Delhi at the party’s “Tiranga (Tricolour) yatra” in Patna. Party rally in Patna “About 10,000 party workers from across the State had participated in the programme which began from the Miller High School ground to the J P roundabout near the Gandhi Maidan,” State leader Rajesh Sinha told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/aap-will-come-out-as-a-strong-option-in-bihar/article37714820.ece
27 November 2021||Pune,||MVA Govt. will fall by March next year: Rane||The tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government would collapse and a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government would come to power by March 2022, Union Minister and senior leader Narayan Rane said on Friday. Speaking at a meeting in Jaipur, Mr. Rane, the Minister of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) said he was merely endorsing what the BJP’s Maharashtra unit chief Chandrakant Patil had predicted earlier. “One will be able to see the expected changes in Maharashtra once the BJP comes to power in March,” he said. Asked how he had arrived at this conclusion, Mr. Rane said, “If one wants to topple a government or form a new one, one needs to keep some things secret.” Responding to Mr. Rane’s remarks, Sena leader and Maharashtra Minister Anil Parab said the MVA did not run or fall on the former’s predictions and that the ruling alliance would complete its full five-year term. While refusing to comment on his bete noire , Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, Mr. Rane said: “It is not good to comment on a person who is ill and bedridden. But the three-party coalition of the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress does not have much life left.” Mr. Thackeray had recently undergone a spine surgery and is recuperating at home.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/mva-govt-will-fall-by-march-next-year-rane/article37715024.ece
