26 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. to revisit income criterion for EWS quota||The Union Government on Thursday informed the Supreme Court that it had taken a “considered decision” to revisit the “criteria” for determining Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) to provide them reservation. The Government, represented by Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta, said it would take four weeks for the exercise. The submission follows rounds of grilling from the court during past hearings to reveal the logic and study before zeroing in on the “exact figure” of Rs. 8 lakh as the annual income limit to identify the EWS. "The Union Government has taken a considered decision to revisit the criteria for determining the economically weaker sections in terms of the provisions of the Explanation to Article 15 of the Constitution inserted by the Constitution (103rd Amendment) Act 2019,” a Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud recorded in its order. The court was hearing a case filed by NEET aspirants challenging a July 29 notification announcing 27% quota to OBCs and 10% reservation to the EWS in the All India Quota (AIQ) category. 4-week delay The Government assured the court that the NEET counselling would be deferred for four weeks till a decision was taken on the EWS quota. “The Solicitor General states that a period of four weeks would be required for this exercise [revisiting EWS criteria] and pending its conclusion, the date for counselling shall stand postponed...” the court order said. The Bench scheduled the case next on January 6. ‘Panel to review criteria’ Mr. Mehta, appearing for the Government along with Additional Solicitor-General K.M. Natraj, said they have been instructed to submit that a committee would be set up to review the “criteria” to identify the EWS category. The EWS quota was meant for persons who earned less than Rs. 8 lakh annually and did not benefit from any other existing reservation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-to-revisit-income-criterion-for-ews-quota/article37695218.ece
26 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Bring in three-rate GST structure’||The Government can rationalise the GST rate structure without losing revenues by rejigging the four major rates of 5%, 12%, 18% and 28% with a three-rate framework of 8%, 15% and 30%, as per a National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP) study. The findings of the NIPFP, an autonomous think tank backed by the Finance Ministry, assume significance as the GST Council has tasked a Group of Ministers, headed by Karnataka CM Basavaraj S. Bommai, to propose a rationalisation of tax rates and a possible merger of different tax slabs by December to shore up revenues. Multiple rate changes since the introduction of the GST regime in July 2017 have brought the effective GST rate to 11.6% from the original revenue neutral rate of 15.5%, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman pointed out at the last Council meeting in September. “Merging the 12% and 18% GST rates into any tax rate lower than 18% may result in revenue loss. Our study proposes that the GST Council may consider a three-rate structure by adopting 8%, 15% and 30% for revenue neutrality,” NIPFP associate professor Sacchidananda Mukherjee told The Hindu . The nature of rate changes has also meant that over 40% of taxable turnover value now falls in the 18% tax slab, thus any move to dovetail that slab with a lower rate will trigger losses to the tax kitty that need to be offset by marginal hikes in other remaining major rates — 5% and 28%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bring-in-three-rate-gst-structure/article37695223.ece
26 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Rs. 10,000 cr. more allotted for MGNREGS||The Finance Ministry has allocated additional funds of Rs. 10,000 crore as an interim measure for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) after it ran out of funds allocated in the budget, according to the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD). More funds may be forthcoming based on the “assessment of demand,” added the Ministry. A Ministry spokesperson told The Hindu the extra money was allocated on November 5. However, the scheme’s financial statement on November 25 still reflects a negative net balance of Rs. 9,888 crore. Despite the additional allocations, the funds available for the scheme stand at Rs. 76,340 crore, well below the Rs. 86,229 crore which have been incurred as expenditure, including payments due for wages and materials. The scheme’s balance sheets remain in the red in 24 States and Union Territories. “Further allocation may be made upon assessment of demand during the revised estimate stage,” said an MoRD statement issued on Thursday. These revised estimates will be included in supplementary budget demands made to Parliament when the winter session opens on Monday. Meanwhile, more than Rs. 1,170 crore worth of wage payments for MGNREGS workers are still pending. “Lack of funds results in suppression of demand for work and delayed payment of wages to workers. These are violations of the Act; they also constrain economic recovery,” said an open letter from more than 70 economists to the Prime Minister on Wednesday, demanding that additional funds be provided immediately to strengthen and expand the scheme. They noted that 13% of households which demanded work had failed to get the same, adding that the unmet demand is as high as 20% in Gujarat, Telangana and Bihar. In its statement, the MoRD acknowledged that the MGNREGA is a demand-driven scheme, meaning that its funding must increase to accommodate increases in demand. “Whenever, additional funds are required, the Ministry of Finance is requested to provide the funds. In the previous financial year, the Ministry of Finance allocated Rs. 50,000 crore additional funds for the scheme over and above that of BE [budget estimates],” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rs-10000-cr-more-allotted-for-mgnregs/article37695251.ece
26 November 2021||JEWAR,||U.P. will be best linked State under double-engine govt.: PM||After 70 years of Independence, Uttar Pradesh is finally getting what it deserves as the “double-engine government” has ensured that the State transforms into the best connected region in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday. He was speaking at the foundation laying ceremony of the Noida International Airport at Jewar in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh. “For so many years since Independence, U.P. was sneered at for poverty, caste-based politics, corruption, poor roads, absence of industries, arrested development and nexus between criminals and politicians. The people of U.P. would wonder whether U.P. could ever have a positive image,” Mr. Modi said addressing the massive gathering. Minister for Civil Aviation Jyotiraditya Scindia, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and many of his ministerial colleagues were also present at the event. “Our double-engine government has ensured that today U.P. is transformed into the best connected region. In western U.P., there are projects worth several lakh crore. There is rapid rail corridor, expressway, metro connectivity, dedicated freight corridors. This is the new identity of a progressive U.P. This fast-paced development is a guarantee of a strong country,” said Mr. Modi. He said that Noida International Airport will become the logistics gateway for northern India and will turn the region into an export-centre where even MSMEs will have easier access to overseas markets. The first phase of the airport will be ready by October 2024.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/up-will-be-best-linked-state-under-double-engine-govt-pm/article37695256.ece
26 November 2021||Hubballi/Bengaluru,||COVID clusters detected in city, Dharwad||Karnataka on Thursday reported two COVID-19 clusters, one in a medical college in Dharwad and another in a school in Bengaluru. Dharwad district, which has been recording zero positivity of late, suffered a jolt with 66 medical students testing positive, forcing the district administration to seal down two hostels of the SDM College of Medical Sciences and Hospital in Dhawad city. In Bengaluru, a cluster was reported in The International School Bangalore, which is a boarding school, where 33 students and one staff member tested positive. While 32 are isolated in the school campus, two students have been sent home after their parents requested the school. All are asymptomatic and the school campus has been sealed, said Health Department officials. Those who contracted the virus in the Dharwad college had received double dose of the vaccination. While some have mild symptoms, many are asymptomatic. All would be quarantined for the next fortnight. The Health Department will get all the samples genome-sequenced to find out the variant. Health Commissioner D. Randeep said there were chances of widespread infection if it had been caused by the Delta variant or its sub-lineages. A majority of the medical students, who tested positive, had attended a students’ programme at D. Veerendra Heggade Kalakshetra on the college premises on November 17 and all the primary contacts are being tested. Dharwad Deputy Commissioner Nitesh Patil, after visiting the medical college and assessing the situation, said that all the students and faculty members had been directed to undergo RT-PCR test. “Of the 400 students in the college, so far 300 students have been tested and 66 have tested positive. The results of tests on the remaining 100 students will come on Friday,” he said. Stating that it was too early to conclude if these clusters indicated the beginning of a fresh surge in Karnataka, Mr. Randeep said: “We have seen such clusters being reported from educational institutions in the last two months.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/covid-clusters-detected-in-city-dharwad/article37695252.ece

The authorities snapped mobile Internet services in parts of the city “as a precautionary measure”. Clashes between local youth and security forces were reported from the Nawa Kadal area, native place of The Resistance Front (TRF) slain ‘commander’ Mehran Shalla, on Wednesday night. Street protests People alleged the security forces disallowed funeral prayers in absentia for the slain militant, which led to street protests. “The bodies of all the three militants were buried in Handwara,” a senior police officer said. A spontaneous shutdown was observed in parts of the old city. Shops and offices remained closed in the Lal Bazaar, Hawal, Khanyar, Bohri Kadal, Jamalatta and Nawakadal areas. Security was also beefed up in these areas. However, the shutdown did not impact the movement of vehicles. Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti has also questioned the manner in which the “encounter” took place. “After yesterday’s alleged encounter at Rambagh, legitimate doubts are looming over its authenticity. As per reports and witnesses, it seems that the firing was one-sided. Again, the official version far from truth is not in line with ground realities as seen in Shopian, HMT & Hyderpora,” Ms. Mufti said in a tweet. Reacting to Ms. Mufti’s statement, DGP Dilbag Singh said there are people in the civil society who somehow understand the reality but try to say something that is away from the reality. “There are many people active on the social media who are trying to cast aspersions on the killing of terrorists. Unfortunately, there are people who have started looking at the killers as innocent people. In the Rambagh encounter, three terrorists were killed,” Mr. Singh said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/srinagar-tense-over-shoot-out-mobile-internet-cut-after-clash/article37695133.ece
26 November 2021||New Delhi,||Cong. seeks Opposition unity in House||The Congress will reach out to Opposition parties, including the Trinamool Congress, to seek the repeal of the farm laws on the first day of the winter session of Parliament, and to demand a new law to guarantee minimum support price (MSP), an immediate debate on price rise and the dismissal of the Minister of State for Home Affairs Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’, whose son is an accused in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident. This was decided at a meeting of the Congress parliamentary strategy group on Thursday, held at party president Sonia Gandhi’s residence. Ms. Gandhi is said to have asked the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, reach out to other Opposition parties. Deputy Leader Anand Sharma and Chief Whip Jairam Ramesh would also be reaching out to Opposition leaders for joint action on key issues. But party leaders also agreed that disruption of proceedings should be the last resort and MPs must get a chance to raise their issues during the Question Hour and the Zero Hour. The Congress would also insist on debating the Pegasus issue in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and seek a reply from him, demand Rs. 4 lakh compensation for COVID victims and seek a discussion on the reported Chinese incursion across Indian territory on the Arunachal Pradesh border. Apart from Mr. Kharge, Mr. Sharma and Mr. Ramesh, those who attended the meeting included senior leader A.K. Antony, Lok Sabha leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, deputy leader Gaurav Gogoi, chief whip K. Suresh, Manickam Tagore and Ravneet Singh Bittu. Some of the leaders present at the meeting told The Hindu that all the leaders expressed their displeasure over the Trinamool’s new-found aggression against the Congress but Mr. Kharge reiterated the earlier stand taken by former party chief Rahul Gandhi that “parties may have differences in the State but need to work together in Parliament”. “As the principal Opposition party, we will make sincere efforts to take everyone along and take collective decision. Mr. Kharge will convene a meeting of Opposition parties in the morning of November 29. It is up to Trinamool whether they would reciprocate or not. But we won't let it dictate terms,” a senior leader said. Trinamool Rajya Sabha floor leader Derek O’Brien said it was not unusual for an Opposition strategy meeting not to take place before the session. “There are certain obvious issues, the MSP, compensation for 750 farmers who lost their lives in the agitation, the continuous attack on federalism and so on. We are all on the same page on this issue,” he said. He denied allegations that the Trinamool’s recent recruitment drive, poaching Congress leaders, will throw Opposition unity into disarray. “We haven’t poached any Congress leader. Those who joined the Trinamool have done so by their own free will and because they believe in Mamata Banerjee's leadership,” he added. The winter session will be the first one for two former Congress leaders — Sushmita Dev and Luizinho Falerio — who joined Trinamool and were elected to the Upper House.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-seeks-opposition-unity-in-house/article37695151.ece
26 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||NFHS says women outnumber men||The fifth edition of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) has confirmed signs of a demographic shift in India. For the first time since the NFHS began in 1992, the proportion of women exceeded men: there were 1,020 women for 1,000 men. In the last edition of the survey in 2015-16, there were 991 women for every 1,000 men. Only the decadal Census is considered the official marker of population trends in India and has a wider surveillance programme. The NFHS surveys are smaller, but are conducted at the district level and are a pointer to the future. Only improved However, sex ratio at birth for children born in the past five years only improved from 919 per 1,000 males in 2015-16 to 929 per 1,000, underscoring that boys, on average, continued to have better odds of survival than girls. Most Indian States and Union Territories (UTs) had more women than men, the NFHS-5 shows. The States that had fewer women than men included Gujarat, Maharashtra, Arunachal Pradesh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab and Union Territories such as Jammu & Kashmir, Chandigarh, Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and Ladakh. All of these States and UTs, however, showed improvements in the population increase of women. A State-wise breakup of the NFHS data also show that India is on its way to stabilising its population, with most States and UTs having a Total Fertility Rate (TFR) of less than two. A TFR of less than 2.1, or a woman on average bearing two children over a lifetime, suggests that an existing generation of a people will be exactly replaced. Anything less than two suggests an eventual decline in population over time. Only six States — Bihar, Meghalaya, Manipur, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh — have a TFR above two. Bihar has a TFR of three which, however, is an improvement from the 3.4 of the NFHS-4. Again, the TFR in all States has improved in the five years. Most populous country India is still poised to be the most populous country in the world, with the current projection by the United Nations population division forecasting that India’s population will peak at 1.6 billion to 1.8 billion from 2040 to 2050. A Government report last year projected that India would overtake China as the world’s most populous country around 2031 — almost a decade later than the United Nations projection of 2022. A notable exception is Kerala, a State with among the highest ratios of women to men at 1,121 and improvement over 1,049 recorded in the NFHS-4. However, the TFR in Kerala has increased to 1.8 from 1.6. The State has also reported a decline in the sex ratio of children born in the past five years. There were 1,047 females per 1,000 males in 2015-16 that has now declined to 951 per 1,000 males. The findings of NFHS-5 from 22 States and UTs covered in Phase-I were released in December 2020, and the remaining comprising Arunachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, Odisha, Puducherry, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand were made public on Wednesday. The NFHS-5 survey work has been conducted in around 6.1 lakh sample households from 707 districts (as on March, 2017) of the country, covering 724,115 women and 101,839 men to provide disaggregated estimates up to the district level.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nfhs-says-women-outnumber-men/article37695168.ece
26 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Scorpene class submarine INS Vela joins Navy||The fourth Scorpene class conventional submarine, INS Vela , was commissioned into the Navy in the presence of Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Karambir Singh at a ceremony in Mumbai on Thursday. “ Vela has taken the ‘Make in India’ spirit a notch higher with the fitment indigenised battery cells, which power a very silent permanently magnetised propulsion motor,” the Navy said in a statement. Construction of the submarine commenced with the first cutting of steel on July 14, 2009 and it was launched and named Vela on May 6, 2019. With this, the Navy currently has 16 conventional and one nuclear submarines in service. It includes eight Russian Kilo class submarines, four German HDW submarines, four French Scorpene submarines and the indigenous nuclear ballistic missile submarine INS Arihant .  Vela is named after a type of Indian fish belonging to the stingray family, and the crest depicts the fish swimming across the blue seas. The submarine’s mascot is the Sub-ray which is an amalgamation of the submarine and the stingray which symbolises the metamorphosis of the submarine’s character with the qualities of a stingray, the Navy said. The new INS Vela carries forward the legacy of its namesake, the erstwhile Vela which was commissioned on August 31, 1973 as the lead boat of Vela class submarines and was decommissioned on January 25, 2010. Navy’s Project-75 Six Scorpene submarines are being built under Project-75 by Mazagaon Dock Ltd. (MDL), Mumbai, under technology transfer from Naval Group of France under a $3.75-bn deal signed in October 2005. The first submarine INS Kalvari was commissioned in December 2017, second submarine INS Khanderi in September 2019 and third one INS Karanj in March 2021. The fifth submarine, Vagir , was launched in November 2020 and is undergoing sea trials while the sixth one Vagsheer is in advanced stage of outfitting. The Navy has drawn up plans to install Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) modules on all Scorpene submarines as they go for their refit beginning with INS Kulvari in 2023 to enhance their endurance. That hinges on the successful fitment of the indigenous AIP module developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation on board a submarine. The land-based prototype has recently undergone successful trials. In parallel, the Navy recently issued the Request For Proposal for procurement of six advanced submarines under Project-75I. The Navy has a 30-year submarine building programme and after the P-75I, the Navy intends to design and build conventional submarines indigenously. “This is going to be may be the last time (P-75I) that we will take any outside assistance; henceforth we will design and build our own submarines,” Navy Chief Adm Singh told The Hindu recently.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/scorpene-class-submarine-ins-vela-joins-navy/article37695124.ece
26 November 2021||New Delhi,||All should respect laws passed by legislature: Rijiju||Law Minister Kiren Rijiju on Thursday said there were “elements” who tried to create hurdles in implementing laws enacted by Parliament and the Assemblies. Mr. Rijiju made these remarks while launching an online course on the Constitution for citizens. “When Parliament passes a Bill or an Assembly adopts a law, until and unless it is unconstitutional, why should there be a reason to say ‘we won’t follow this law’,” he asked. The Law Minister said everyone had the right to oppose, differ and dissent in a democracy but when a law was passed by due process, everyone should respect it. “If our law is constitutional or unconstitutional, let the courts decide,” he said. Mr. Rijiju said the Narendra Modi Government put the Constitution above everything else and none could alter its basic features. The Minister complimented the Department of Law and Justice and NALSAR (National Academy of Legal Studies and Research) for devising the online course. The course seeks to familiarise with the text of the Constitution and leading cases, identify the fundamental policy choices incorporated in it, and examine the historical evolution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/all-should-respect-laws-passed-by-legislature-rijiju/article37695144.ece
26 November 2021||HONG KONG,||China protests Rawat’s comments on security threat||China’s military said on Thursday it had lodged “solemn representations” with India and expressed its “firm opposition” to Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat’s comments earlier this month on China being the biggest security threat to India and mutual suspicion rising between the two sides. People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Senior Colonel Wu Qian, who is spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence, described Gen. Rawat’s comments as “irresponsible and dangerous”, speaking at the Ministry’s monthly press conference in Beijing. Violation of ties “Indian officials speculate on the so-called ‘Chinese military threat’ for no reason, which is a serious violation of the strategic guidance of the leaders of the two countries that China and India do not constitute a threat to each other,” he said, adding that the remarks “incite geopolitical confrontation” and were “irresponsible and dangerous”. He did not say where and how China had “made solemn representations” over the remarks. While the Chinese military’s spokesperson termed the comments a “violation” and “inciting confrontation”, Indian officials have said on many occasions over the past few months that the Chinese military’s actions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) starting last summer — mobilisation of two divisions, deployment of troops in forward areas and multiple transgressions to unilaterally redraw the LAC — had not only violated bilateral understandings but also brought ties to their lowest point in years. Last week, diplomats from the two sides agreed to restart talks between military commanders “at an early date”, with the 13th round of talks in October ending with an acrimonious exchange with each side blaming the other for the stalemate. At last week’s meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs, both agreed to also “ensure a stable ground situation and avoid any untoward incident” until the situation is resolved. Gen. Rawat had said, at an event earlier this month, that while disengagement had taken place in some areas and was in progress in others, de-escalation remained a far-off possibility given a lack of trust and mutual suspicion, not to mention the Chinese side’s construction of infrastructure in forward areas. Indian officials have said China has so far not offered “a credible explanation” of its deployments last year that sparked the crisis. ‘Clear, unambiguous’ The PLA spokesperson said China’s position on the border issue was “clear and unambiguous”. “The Chinese frontier defence forces are determined to safeguard national sovereignty and security, and are also committed to maintaining peace and tranquillity in the border areas, and are making great efforts to promote the de-escalation of the situation,” he said. “There is an old Chinese saying: if you use bronze as a mirror, you can correct your appearance. If you use history as a mirror, you can understand the rise and fall of a state. If you use good people as a mirror, you can understand right from wrong. As neighbouring countries, we hope India and China will meet each other halfway and work together to jointly maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas and jointly maintain the healthy development of relations.”  ...

26 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Centre mulls new testing modes after anaemia surge||Concerned at the rise in cases of anaemia in India across the spectrum of its population, as revealed by the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5), the Centre plans to change the mode of testing for it, along with initiating discussions with the World Health Organization (WHO) on whether “racial characteristics” ought to be accounted for in determining anaemia levels in India. The survey, the full findings of which were made public on Wednesday, found that anaemia in children had increased from 58.6% in the NFHS-4 to 67% in the NFHS-5. The NFHS-4 was conducted in 2015-16 and NFHS-5 in 2019-21. Anaemia in pregnant women increased to 52.2% from 50.4%, and the percentage of women (15-49 years) who were anaemic also increased from 53% to 57%. The percentage of men aged 15-49 who were anaemic also rose from 22.7% to 25%.  The Centre has an ongoing programme called Anaemia Mukt Bharat (Anaemia-free India) to reduce the proportion of anaemia among children to 40%, pregnant women to 32% and lactating women to 40% by 2022. The current NFHS shows a lack of progress towards these goals. Anaemia is commonly characterised by low levels of iron in the body. Anaemia is also believed to result from a lack of nutrition and inadequate intake of fresh fruits and vegetables as well as a deficiency of vitamin B-12. “It was surprising that the proportion of the anaemic increased so significantly between the two editions of the NFHS,” said a senior Health Ministry official. The official said the Government would work with States that showed the most serious deterioration to determine if its ongoing programme of providing folic acid tablets and deworming pills was inadequate. “In the forthcoming NFHS that will begin in 2022 end, we will employ the venous blood extraction method and analyse the results. While our focus will be on improving nutrition and achieving WHO standards, we will also have to see if other factors determine anaemia levels,” the official added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-mulls-new-testing-modes-after-anaemia-surge/article37695163.ece

The committee, led by AAP MLA Raghav Chadha, said it had received multiple complaints on “outrageously offensive and derogatory Instagram stories/posts” allegedly published by Ms. Ranaut. According to the complainants, the stories published by Ms. Ranaut on her Instagram account, which has a massive reach and is followed by around 80 lakh people worldwide, specifically illustrate instances that “hurt the religious sentiments of Sikh community” and have “a tendency to disturb the peace and harmony in society”. The complaints, according to the committee, state that Ms. Ranaut had allegedly labelled the Sikh community as Khalistani terrorists, which led to unbearable humiliation for the community and also apprehensions regarding their safety, life and liberty. The complainants have implored the committee to take immediate note of the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/delhi-house-panel-summons-kangana-over-offensive-posts/article37695142.ece

He also said Congress was failing to play its role as the main Opposition party in the country and people were beginning to believe it was weakening. “Democracy needs an Opposition that can effectively take the party or coalition in power head-on. We looked at available options and reached out to people and friends. We tried to understand the pulse of the people and it said there is a need for a strong pan-India alternative political party,” Mr. Sangma told presspersons in Shilliong, the capital city of Meghalaya. Developing reputation Mr. Sangma said he felt the Trinamool was growing in stature as the party that could stand up to the BJP and its allies. The 12 MLAs had on Wednesday evening submitted the letters of resignation from the Congress to Assembly Speaker Metbah Lyngdoh. The Congress had 17 MLAs and the anti-defection law will not affect the departure of 12 of them.

26 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Panel set up for community kitchens||With the Supreme Court’s three-week deadline looming, the Union Food Ministry on Thursday formed a group of eight State Food Secretaries to create the framework for a community kitchens scheme. At its last hearing on November 16 on a petition regarding starvation deaths, the top court had questioned the Centre’s commitment to run community kitchens, stating that the first responsibility of every welfare state should be to provide food to people dying of hunger. The court pulled up the Centre for its lack of progress in framing a national policy to run community kitchens in consultation with the State Governments, including the funds required, and gave it a three-week deadline to do so. Addressing a meeting of the State Food Ministers, Union Food Minister Piyush Goyal said, “It was a huge achievement that even during the peak of COVID-19, [the Centre] did not allow any food shortages to occur,” crediting the success of the Centre’s free ration scheme. According to an official statement, the Minister added that as a result of collective efforts, no case of death due to starvation had been reported during the pandemic. Setting up the group of Food Secretaries, Mr. Goyal said a new community kitchen scheme needed to be simple and transparent, and build on the four pillars of quality, hygiene, reliability and the spirit of service. The group would be headed by the Food Secretary of Madhya Pradesh and include the Food Secretaries of Kerala, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Assam, Bihar, and West Bengal. It would meet next virtually on November 29 to deliberate on the proposal. The Minister emphasised the need to distribute quality foodgrains to deserving beneficiaries on the basis of need, for “a focused and identified set of people who are vulnerable especially women and children”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/panel-set-up-for-community-kitchens/article37695169.ece

The BJP wing had issued the threat of egg attack in advance, but Mr. Patnaik’s convoy could not be targeted. The CM landed near the venue, cordoned off by a thick security blanket, which denied protesters the opportunity to target him. Mr. Patnaik, more than a dozen of his Ministerial colleagues and Union Minister Bishweswar Tudu have faced “egg attacks” from their political adversaries in the past one month. The BJP is upset as Dibya Shankar Mishra, Minister of State for Home, who is alleged to have close links with Gobhinda Sahu, accused of killing Mamita Meher, a teacher, was not ousted from the Ministry. The BJP alleged the Minister was trying to shield the accused for obvious reasons. The State police had detained BJP and Congress cadres prior to the Chief Ministers visit.

In western U.P., there are projects worth several lakh crore. There is rapid rail corridor, expressway, metro connectivity, dedicated freight corridors. This is the new identity of a progressive U.P. This fast-paced development is a guarantee of a strong country,” said Mr. Modi. He said that Noida International Airport will become the logistics gateway for northern India and will turn the region into an export-centre where even MSMEs will have easier access to overseas markets. The first phase of the airport will be ready by October 2024. It will have a single runway and a passenger terminal building with a capacity to handle 1.2 crore passengers per annum by then. It will be developed over four phases until 2040, by when it will have the capacity to handle seven crore passengers per annum. It was proposed with the aim to decongest Delhi airport which will reach its structural capacity of 11 crore passengers by 2024. While two decades ago the BJP had dreamt of an airport here, subsequent Governments dragged their feet. But today, U.P. has world-standard educational institutions, and is a centre for investment from multi-national companies, Mr Modi said.

Appearing before a Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, for SIT, said it had often walked the extra mile to meet the ends of justice. The SIT was countering allegations made by Zakia Jafri, widow of Congress leader Ehsan Jafri who was killed by a mob, of “collaboration” with conspirators. Ms. Jafri alleges a larger conspiracy behind the riots. Mr. Rohatgi said the SIT had left no stone unturned. It had examined the then Chief Minister, members of the Cabinet, top police officers and bureaucrats. The investigation had led to the arrest of a Gujarat Minister, Maya Kodnani. The senior lawyer dismissed allegations that the Army was called in late. Mr. Rohatgi said the Army was called within three hours of the riots. The Centre and the neighbouring States had provided forces to control the violence. Mr. Rohatgi said the allegations of a “larger conspiracy” behind the riots was baseless. The role of every accused was looked into by the SIT. Accusations of “collaboration” by SIT were reckless, he submitted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/godhra-riots-we-did-an-impeccable-job-says-sit/article37695130.ece

The lowest standard rate will have to be raised from 5% to about 9%. Currently, the GST regime levies eight different rates, including zero for essential goods and special rates of 0.25% on diamonds, precious stones and 3% on gems and jewellery. The NIPFP paper assumes these rates remain unchanged after noting that raising rates on ‘high-value low volume goods’ like precious stones and jewellery ‘may encourage unaccounted (undisclosed) transactions and therefore revenue leakages’. Restructuring GST rates is a timely idea to improve revenues, Mr. Mukherjee said, adding that it was important to sequence the transition to the new rate structure so as to minimise the costs associated with tax compliance, administration and economic distortions. If the GST rate structure prevailing at its onset in July 2017 was restored last year, additional GST revenues of nearly Rs. 1.25 lakh crore could have accrued in 2020-21, estimates the NIPFP paper.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bring-in-three-rate-gst-structure-suggests-study/article37695137.ece

I went to a pharmacy in Nagaland once and the shopkeeper did not recognise me. He asked where I had come from. I said Kolkata. Oh, you have come from India, the shopkeeper said. My heartbeat stopped for two seconds. I asked him if Nagaland was not part of India, but he did not say anything. I mention this incident because post-2014, Mr. Modi worked to remove the emotional rift with people in the northeast,” Mr. Shah said. “By 2024, the Modi Government will connect capitals of all the eight States by air, seven of the eight State capitals will be connected through rail, and a network of roads is operational.

26 November 2021||November 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Unparalleled devotion||The Bhagavata purana highlights the efficacy of bhakti over karma or jnana as these get assimilated in bhakti. Bhakti is thus held to be a sure route to salvation. This is most convincingly exemplified in the case of the Gopis’ love for Krishna which the Lord wished to demonstrate to the world through Uddhava’s experience, pointed out Sri Dushyanth Sridhar in a discourse. Known for his staunch devotion to Krishna, Uddhava is also a close relative and friend of Krishna. Owing to these factors, he has begun to nurture a sense of pride about his devotion. The all-knowing Lord plans to rid him of this flaw that mars true devotion. Once after Krishna had left Gokula and was in Mathura, He thinks of the Gopis’ love for Him and wishes to cheer them up with tidings from Him. So He sends Uddhava to Gokula on this mission. Uddhava is able to vibe with the experience of the God love that pervades the way of life of the Gopis. Even in Krishna’s absence, they have learnt to live in the same state of love for Him every moment, and feel His presence in all their activities. Narayana Bhattatiri says in this context that Uddhava salutes their bhakti as something unheard of or unseen so far in all the worlds. How many can reach the level of devotion evinced by the Gopis, he wonders. No amount of scholarship in scriptures or engaging in austere practices and rituals can take one to this quality of devotional attainment. Even the sages and rishis in meditation have to strive hard to reach such oneness with God.

The Bill is listed in the tentative legislative agenda for the upcoming winter session of Parliament. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had proposed this Bill in her Budget 2021-22 speech. Mr. Raja called the move retrograde and said it would jeopardise the interests of the common people and the backward regions of the country. In his letter to the Prime Minister, Mr. Raja said the public sector banks had acted as catalysts in the economic development of our nation in general and particularly for the underprivileged sections of the society and the backward regions of the country.

26 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||India flays raising bilateral issues at SCO||Raising bilateral issues is counterproductive to the spirit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said on Thursday. Delivering a speech virtually at the 20th meeting of the SCO Council of Heads of Government, Mr. Jaishankar obliquely criticised Pakistan and China and called for reform in the multilateral institutions, including in the World Health Organization (WHO). “It is unfortunate to note that there have been repeated attempts to deliberately bring bilateral issues into SCO. This violates the well-established principles and norms of the SCO Charter. Such acts are counterproductive to the spirit of consensus and cooperation that define this organisation and should be condemned,” the Minister said. Both India and Pakistan joined the SCO at the Astana summit in 2017 and Pakistan has ever since tried to raise the Kashmir issue on this platform. Both India and Russia have urged Islamabad not to raise such bilateral matters repeatedly. The SCO Charter sealed in 2002 calls for “peaceful settlement” of conflicts and disputes among member states. Mr. Jaishankar said the pandemic had exposed the weaknesses of vital global mechanisms that should have acted more efficiently, adding, “This is the time to bring in much needed reforms to our global institutions, including the WHO, and rework our development strategies to face a post-COVID-19 world”. ‘Important group’ He argued that India “considers the SCO as an important regional group”, which operates on the basis of “universally recognised international norms, good governance, rule of law, openness, transparency and equality”. Addressing the virtual meeting chaired by Kazakhstan, Mr. Jaishankar said India had taken steps to operationalise the port of Chabahar in Iran for expanding connectivity options of the Central Asian countries. In a veiled criticism of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) that passes through parts of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, he said connectivity corridors should respect sovereignty.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-condemns-raising-bilateral-issues-at-sco/article37695166.ece

26 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Schools in front line of child protection’||In the wake of recent crimes of child sexual abuse and harassment reported, over 400 school heads and teachers in Chennai were told that the schools were in the front line of child protection. This was conveyed at a workshop on child protection and safety, organised by the School Education Department on Wednesday in association with Tulir – Centre for the Prevention and Healing of Child Sexual Abuse. The three-hour workshop was aimed at addressing the ability of schools to respond better to crimes of child sexual abuse and to guide them on student safety and protection from sexual violence. Topics of discussion “We talked to them about two aspects — child sexual abuse and the dynamics of how the crime is committed as well as enhancing the understanding that schools have. The POCSO Act and how schools are accountable, both in terms of prevention and the role they play in reporting instances of abuse in an institutional setting, were discussed,” said Nancy Thomas, Programme Manager, Tulir. A Government Order issued earlier this year which called for safe practices during online classes, setting up of a Central Complaints Committee and forming a student safeguarding advisory committee and installation of complaint boxes was highlighted. School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi urged teachers to not dissuade students from reporting instances of sexual abuse or harassment. Speaking ahead of the workshop, Mr. Mahesh said that it was important for schools not only to sensitise teachers, but also engage with the parents. Kakarla Usha, Principal Secretary, School Education Department, said a number of such crimes came to light in the last few weeks. Institutions should take the first step to recognise the threat of child sexual abuse, she said. “Children often do not report because they feel ashamed or blame themselves. They should be encouraged to report while being told that child sexual abuse was a crime, ” she said.  Schools can understand the fear that children have in reporting abuse, and how better it can be addressed Nancy Thomas Program Manager, Tulir||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/schools-in-front-line-of-child-protection/article37695326.ece

He was speaking at the second edition of ‘Summit on India: global chemicals and petrochemicals manufacturing hub’ in New Delhi. Mr. Thennarasu said the projects would ensure the supply of feedstock to strengthen and position the State as a petrochemical investment destination. “The projects will also create an immense potential for downstream investment opportunities for large to smaller companies to be a part of our growth story,” he said. Listing the steps being taken by the State Government for strengthening the ecosystem, he cited the establishment of Tamil Nadu Polymer Park, spread across 306 acres near Chennai, to cater to plastic manufacturing and logistics. “We have proposed to establish a pharmaceutical park and a textile park in the State. The Government is strengthening the cross-country and city gas distribution pipeline to ensure feedstock availability,” he said. New industrial zones and industrial land banks are being developed across the State to establish sector-specific clusters for electronics, foods, furniture, chemicals and petrochemicals, among others, he said. Uninterrupted supply “Our Government is delivering uninterrupted power supply to most industrial establishments. We have taken initiatives to advocate clean energy to increase power generation through renewable energy sources such as solar and wind,” the Minister said. Recalling the recent launch of the ‘Single window portal 2.0’, which offers investors more than 100 services, the Minister said the system ensured that all necessary clearances are accorded within timelines. “The Biz Buddy system has also been advocated.

26 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Spike in cases of fever, waterborne diseases||Post-rain and heavy inundation, there has been a rise in fever cases and waterborne diseases in the city. A number of hospitals in Chennai, both government and private, are seeing a steady rise in the number of patients reporting with fever and acute diarrhoeal diseases over the past few weeks. With several parts of the city heavily inundated following the recent heavy rain, there have been complaints of drinking water contamination in many areas. As a result of poor hygiene and sanitation, there have been an upswing in infectious diseases. According to health officials, fever and diarrhoeal diseases were on the rise, with certain zones, particularly zone IV (Tondiarpet) seeing a slight increase in the number of diarrhoeal diseases. About 850 fever cases and 300 acute diarrhoeal diseases were reported in a fortnight this month in the city. Cases of dengue and leptospirosis have also been reported. Doctors of the departments of Medicine and Paediatrics of Government Stanley Medical College Hospital pointed out that there has been a three-fold rise in the number of fever cases. Many of these patients were presenting with mild illness and a few had complications such as shock and renal failure, they said. The hospital has a separate ward with about 160 beds for patients with fever and diarrhoeal diseases. At the Rajiv Gandhi Government Government General Hospital, dean E. Theranirajan said at present, there were 52 in-patients with fever of which 11 had tested positive for dengue. “There is a rise in waterborne infections, particularly acute gastroenteritis following the rains. We saw a few patients who had vomiting, diarrhoea and severe dehydration resulting in acute kidney injury requiring dialysis. So, those experiencing tiredness and reduced urine output should seek medical help at the earliest,” he said. Gastroenteritis cases Janani Sankar, senior consultant, Kanchi Kamakoti CHILDS Trust Hospital, said they had many children turn up with gastroenteritis. “At least 70% of the hospital admissions are of patients with diarrhoea. There is an outbreak of dengue but most of the children are stable. We are seeing many cases of flu-like illnesses and respiratory illnesses. There are cases of viral fever, dengue fever and some cases of typhoid too,” she said. Cases of gastroenteritis had increased following flooding in many parts of the city that resulted in sewage mixing with drinking water. The symptoms of gastroenteritis in children are vomiting, loose stools while some may have fever and abdominal pain and dehydration, she said. Usually, when rains abate, there is an increase in the incidence of waterborne and vector-borne diseases, R. Ebenezer, senior consultant and head, Critical Care Medicine, Apollo Speciality Hospitals, said. R. Shanthimalar, dean of Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital, said last month, the number of admissions due to fever were around 1,200 to 1,500, while it was around 700 to 800 so far this month. “Accessibility to clean water is important. Hydration and hygiene should be the priority. People should boil water and drink. Even packaged drinking water should be boiled before use, ” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/spike-in-cases-of-fever-waterborne-diseases/article37695335.ece

Thyagarajan, president, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants’ Association, said the market received 45 truckloads of tomatoes, mainly from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.

It may take another month for the prices to stabilise after the next harvest.

26 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||DGCA issues safety guidelines for flights carrying dignitaries||The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has issued elaborate guidelines to ensure highest standards of safety of aircraft owned by State governments or other entities used for official/non-official carriage of Central, State and foreign dignitaries. Acting on the outcome of an investigation of accidents/incidents involving such aircraft operations, the aviation watchdog said there was a need for harmonisation of requirements and guidelines. “It is essential that adequate measures are taken by all concerned to ensure the highest standards of safety for operation of such flights,” the DGCA said in the safety advisory. It said twin-engine aircraft with good operational capability, reliability and easy maintainability characteristics should be used, and their operations should be in accordance with the aircraft rules and instructions issued from time to time. Survival kits Before commencement of such flights, the pilot-in-command should familiarise himself with necessary meteorological information required for the intended trip. In case of flights over flooded areas, the pilots were told to ensure that appropriate survival kits were available for each person on board, and that prior to the commencement of such flights, the passengers are suitably briefed for proper use of the kits in the event of an emergency. “For every flight under Instrument Flight Rules, the pilot should study the current weather reports and forecast and plan alternative courses of action to provide for the eventuality that the flight may not be completed as planned because of weather conditions. In case meteorological observations and weather forecasts are not available at the point of departure, the pilot shall obtain the same from the nearest meteorological office through telephone or police wireless network or any means he considers fit,” the advisory said. Laying emphasis on the possession of ‘Certificate of Airworthiness’, the DGCA said the aircraft should be inspected and certified prior to flights by an aircraft maintenance engineer. Defects in the aircraft, engines and its instruments or equipment reported by the pilot-in-command or detected during on-ground inspection should be rectified and certified by an appropriate licenced engineer before commencement of the next flight.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dgca-issues-safety-guidelines-for-flights-carrying-dignitaries/article37695387.ece
26 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Idol Wing CID will be strengthened: Minister||Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Minister P.K. Sekarbabu on Thursday said the government had taken steps to strengthen the Idol Wing CID to prevent thefts in temples. “We have identified idols smuggled to foreign countries and taken steps to bring them back with the help of the Centre,” he told reporters before a review meeting with joint commissioners, assistant commissioners and regional commissioners. Mr. Sekarbabu said the DMK government was committed to protecting the idols and would create strongrooms across the State. “Though the AIADMK government announced 3,087 strongrooms, there was no progress in the work. We have completed the work in Puliyur in Chennai and Pandanallur and set up similar strong rooms in other temples. The government has allotted Rs. 308.70 crore for the project and these rooms will prevent idol theft,” he said. The Minister also announced that all the temple tanks would be renovated. “We have divided the temple tanks into two categories: tanks that need immediate attention and tanks that can be renovated in a phased manner. In the current year we have decided to renovate 40 tanks. Soon tenders will be called for the works,” he said. He said Chief Minister M.K. Stalin had allotted Rs. 100 crore for renovating tanks, flower gardens and temple cars and the department was inspecting over 1,000 temple tanks. “In Madhavaram, we have decided to create a new tank for the Kailasanathar temple. I inspected the Siruvapuri Murugan temple along with the commissioner. The steps of the temples are in bad shape and they would be repaired at a cost of Rs. 2.42 crore,” he said. Fund allocation Asked why small temples had not been given adequate attention, he said ever since the DMK government came to power, the Chief Minister had increased the allocation for temples in villages to Rs. 2 lakh from Rs. 1 lakh. “Similarly, the fund for temples in Adi Drvaidar settlements have also been increased to Rs. 2 lakh. The salary for the priests of temples covered under ‘oru kaala pujai’ has been increased to Rs. 1,000,” he said.

26 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||High Court rules on issuance of intercaste marriage certificates||The Madras High Court has held that a person will not be entitled to an intercaste marriage certificate if he actually belonged to a Scheduled Caste but had obtained a Backward Class certificate after converting to Christianity and then married a Scheduled Caste woman. Justice S.M. Subramaniam of the HIghCourt held so, while dismissing a writ petition that was filed by an engineer against the refusal of the Mettur tahsildar to issue an intercaste marriage certificate to him, although he had married a woman belonging to the Scheduled Caste (Arunthathiyar) community. The judge said the object behind the issuance of intercaste marriage certificates was to provide certain welfare schemes. In such circumstances, when both the husband and wife belong to the same caste, they would not be entitled to the certificate for the purpose of availing of the benefits under various schemes. “This court is of the considered opinion that conversion from one religion to another will not change the caste of a person. In the present case, the petitioner admittedly belongs to the Christian Adi Dravidar community, and by virtue of conversion to Christianity, he was issued with the Backward Class certificate.” “However, by birth, the petitioner belongs to Adi Dravidar community and change of religion will not change the community. In the event of a converted person claiming intercaste marriage certificate, it would pave way for the citizen to abuse the benefit to be granted under the intercaste marriage quota,” the High Court judge wrote.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-rules-on-issuance-of-intercaste-marriage-certificates/article37695355.ece
26 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||T.N. posits higher figure for sex ratio at birth||While acknowledging that the National Family Health Survey-5 has presented a realistic assessment of women and child health in Tamil Nadu this year, the State has offered real-time statistics to show that the sex ratio at birth is not as bad as recorded in the NFHS data. Using data from the Civil Registration System (available in the public domain), health officials have shown that the sex ratio at birth over the last five years has been in the 900s range, and not 867 as listed in NFHS-5. In fact, the trend has been upward, with the ratio of women to men improving incrementally over the years, and dropping marginally to 939 in 2020. “This is data, as real as it gets, since it comes from the Civil Registration System. Parents record whether they have male or female children in the birth certificate. It is based on records and therefore are indisputable. We also have individual data on the birth certificates. They present a more realistic picture of sex ratio at birth. Sex Ratio at birth has consistently been over 930 since 2016,” explains Darez Ahmed, Mission Director, National Health Mission. It may be remembered that Tamil Nadu disputed the finding of the District-Level Household Survey-4 2012-13 that only 56% of children aged 12-23 months in the State were fully vaccinated. It was lesser than the figure reported even in the previous surveys, the State contended. Subsequently, cluster surveys conducted by researchers at the Department of Epidemiology, ICMR-National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai, led by Manoj Murhekar, showed that fully vaccinated children as per mother’s recall was 79.9%, and the validated coverage of vaccines with cards was 79.9%. In a paper published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research in 2017, the researchers averred that vaccine coverage in the State was about 80%. Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said with particular reference to the DLHS vaccination count that during that particular year, Kerala and Tamil Nadu had introduced the pentavalent vaccine (five-in-one vaccine), so a question on separate injections for what the pentavalent vaccine replaced was not perceived properly. “In the case of this year’s NLHS and the sex ratio at birth statistic, it might probably be an error of sampling. The actual figures are obviously more reliable. While a sample survey will help in places where data is not available or difficult to come by, where actual granular data is available as in the CRS here, we would rather go by the latter,” he explained. But he hastened to add that Tamil Nadu takes the NFHS seriously as a means to correct what needs to be corrected in the State.  In the case of this year’s NLHS and the sex ratio at birth statistic, it might probably be an error of sampling. The actual figures are obviously more reliable J.

According to the data, 1,38,74,426 people are yet to get the first dose in the State. As many as 73,46,363 people are due for the second shot. Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan, in a communication to Collectors and the Greater Chennai Corporation, said as per the death data collected in August, September and October, 2021, in the State, 2,011 people died of COVID-19, of which 109 deaths — only 5% — were among the unvaccinated. This too was due to delayed treatment and co-morbidities. The remaining 95% were unvaccinated people or those who had taken just a single jab, he said. Of the 95%, around 84% (1,675) deaths were recorded among unvaccinated people and 11% (227) among those who had not taken the second shot. “According to Tamil Nadu data, the risk of an unvaccinated person dying because of COVID-19 is 3.5 times higher that that of a vaccinated person. This is one of the substantial evidences available with us that should help the common man understand the importance of vaccination and the need to take vaccines at the earliest. We have sufficient stock of vaccines across the State,” he said. The Health Secretary said Erode, Namakkal, Salem, Chennai, Chengalpattu and their surrounding areas were still driving the increase in infections. All districts bordering Kerala need to continue to stay alert due to frequent travel and movement of people on both sides, he said. Mr. Radhakrishnan asked officials to insist that people wear masks in public places and crowded places. He urged officials to enforce COVID-19-appropriate behaviour. He said with a decline in active cases, people had stopped taking preventive measures seriously. He pushed for the inoculation of unvaccinated eligible people and those due for the second dose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/13-crore-eligible-people-in-tamil-nadu-yet-to-take-the-first-dose-of-vaccines/article37695310.ece

26 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Second phase of counselling for engineering admissions to be held||Tamil Nadu Engineering Admissions (TNEA) committee will conduct the second phase of counselling to fill vacancies in engineering seats under the single-window system. The Higher Education Department issued a government order on Thursday to this effect. The G.O. says the Directorate of Technical Education had suggested the move after analysing vacant seats in engineering colleges in the past seven years. The TNEA coordination committee, which had been constituted earlier this year, had suggested that the vacant seats arising out of students either not joining their allotted seats or discontinuing after joining in the college, be filled through another phase of counselling after completion of scheduled counselling. The second phase could be held after providing “a reasonable time to pool the vacancies in colleges” and counselling could be conducted for those students registered and admitted, the coordinating committee said. In 2003, the State government authorised the TNEA to conduct counselling, wherein all colleges surrendered certain number of seats to the general pool. Vacant seats returned to the colleges could be filled within seven days from the last day of TNEA counselling. Until 2017, counselling was an in-person process held in Anna University. In the academic year 2018-19 online application submission was introduced. Earlier this year, the government constituted a coordination committee to conduct online counselling for the academic year 2020-21. According to the Higher Education Department officials, Anna University has 425 seats vacant. Vacancies to go up This number could, however, go up when MBBS counselling is held. This year, due to a series of litigation, there is no clarity on when counselling for medical seats would be conducted. Elaborating on the process, an official said: “The current vacant seats will be filled by allowing already admitted students to upgrade to better colleges and courses based on their rank.” The details of the schedule would be announced shortly, the official added. As per the revised academic calendar released by the All India Council for Technical Education, colleges should start classes for first year from November 30.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/second-phase-of-counselling-for-engineering-admissions-to-be-held/article37695337.ece

Siva Shankaran, commonly known as Siva Shankar Baba, facing multiple child sexual abuse cases, can be admitted to a private hospital for specialised treatment if the government doctors are of such opinion. Justice M. Nirmal Kumar passed the order on a petition filed by the accused seeking a direction to the police as well as Puzhal Central Prison officials, to admit him to a private hospital so that he could get treated for multiple complications at his own cost. During the course of the hearing, Additional Public Prosecutor (APP) Raj Thilak informed the court that the accused was admitted to Government Stanley Medical College Hospital on Monday after he complained of chest pain. He said the accused was taken to government ophthalmologists on November 15 and 20, since he was suffering from diabetic retinopathy. The ophthalmologists had treated him and had asked him to be brought in for a review on November 27, he added. Mr. Thilak said the government hospitals were fully equipped to treat the petitioner. In his affidavit,the petitioner insisted on being admitted to a private hospital since he was reportedly suffering from abnormal blood pressure and constant chest pain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/admit-siva-shankar-baba-to-pvt-hospital-if-advised/article37695639.ece

Alagiri on Thursday demanded that the BJP government at the Centre provide Rs. 338 per day as wages under the 100-day Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) as recommended by a committee of the Ministry of Labour and Employment. He said BJP government was being lax about the scheme right from the beginning. Consistent increase He said when the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government had introduced the scheme, the wage per day was Rs. 65, which was consistently increased to Rs. 148 per day by 2014. Due to this, 14 crore persons were lifted out of poverty in 10 years, and it was considered as one of the biggest achievements of the UPA government, he added. When there was inflation, the wage too had to be increased. The committee constituted under the BJP government had recommended Rs. 383 as the wage per day to be paid under the scheme, but the party was not willing to implement it, Mr. Alagiri said. “The BJP government has reduced funding for the MGNREGS by 30%. Without increasing the funding, you cannot fulfill the main agenda of the scheme of providing jobs for 100 days. Almost 24 States do not have funds to pay for the scheme. It is the duty of the Central government to implement the scheme and not the States’,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pay-rs-338-per-day-under-mgnregs-as-recommended/article37695638.ece

Panneerselvam on Thursday urged the government to drop it. In a statement, he cited a circular issued in this regard by Anna University, which followed a decision by the Commercial Taxes Department, and said students and parents expected that both should be revoked.

26 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC refuses to stay I-T dept.’s demand of Rs. 83.58 crore from Panneerselvam||The Madras High Court on Thursday refused to stay operation of orders passed by Income Tax department on September 28 demanding Rs. 83.58 crore in tax from former Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam for the assessment years 2015-16 to 2017-18. The demand was raised pursuant to the search and seizures made on the premises of businessman J. Sekar Reddy and others in December 2016. Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu said though the writ petitioner (Mr. Panneerselvam) had made out an arguable case and the matter required consideration, “no interim order is immediately called for.” The judges, however, made it clear that any steps taken by the Income Tax department in the interregnum would abide by the result of the writ petitions. They directed the Income Tax department’s senior standing counsel A.P. Srinivas to take notices on behalf of the official respondents and file counter affidavits. The former Chief Minister had filed three writ petitions before the court with identical prayers — to declare as unconstitutional an explanation provided to a particular clause in a notification issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) on April 27 this year. Pending adjudication of the three writ petitions, he had urged the court to stay the operation of the three notices issued to him by the Income Tax department demanding Rs. 83.58 crore. In the first notice pertaining to the assessment year 2015-16, a demand for Rs. 20,00,971 had been raised. In the other two notices for 2016-17 and 2017-18, demands for Rs. 1,26,58,676 and Rs. 82,12,14,485 respectively had been raised. The notices stated that the demands had been raised by exercising powers under Section 153C of the Income Tax Act of 1961 which empowers the officials concerned to assess the income of any person and demand appropriate tax if any information regarding his/her undisclosed assets or income gets unearthed during a search and seizure operation undertaken at the premises of another person. Mr. Panneerselvam had questioned the procedure adopted by the officials while undertaking the assessment proceedings. However, Mr. Srinivas told the court that the law was quite clear and that it had been clearly stipulated that the amended procedure would apply only to searches initiated on or after April 1, 2021 and that searches undertaken before April this year would be governed by the old procedure. After recording his submission, the judges asked him to ensure that counter affidavits were filed within four weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-refuses-to-stay-i-t-depts-demand-of-rs-8358-crore-from-panneerselvam/article37695349.ece

In his letter, Mr. Stalin said the permanent Tamil residents of Singapore and Malaysia, who visited India during the COVID-19 pandemic, were facing hardships while returning to the countries because of the non-availability of direct flights. People from Tamil Nadu were also finding it tough to travel to these countries. “They have to travel through Dubai, Doha and Colombo, which is causing serious inconvenience and a financial burden to the people as they have to pay higher charges and travel long distances. In addition, due to the lack of an agreement on temporary air transport bubbles with Singapore and Malaysia, the travel business is being cornered by foreign airlines and not our country’s airlines,” he said. Therefore, the Union Minister should make a temporary ‘air transport bubble’ agreement with Singapore and Malaysia at the earliest, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cm-seeks-air-transport-bubble-deals/article37695313.ece

26 November 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Experts caution people on possible encounters with elephants||With the movement of wild elephants increasing due to seasonal migration, experts warn people residing in areas close to forests of possible frequent encounters as the animals are looking for easy food such as rice, fruits and vegetables that are stored in houses and shops apart from raiding crops. A family at Kalappanaicken Palayam near Vadavalli had a night of terror as a herd of seven elephants damaged the kitchen of the house and took out ration rice that was kept in sacks late on Wednesday. The elephants stood outside the house devouring the rice, before being chased by the local residents. Residents of Valparai plateau are used to such incidents where human-elephant interactions are daily affairs. “Elephants have an incredible sense of smell. They can smell palatable items from a distance with their trunks. They can easily detect eatables, smells of which they are accustomed to,” said J. Peter Prem Chakravarthy, a biologist with the Anamalai Tiger Reserve (ATR). According to him, people living in such areas should avoid venturing out at night. Keeping lights around the house on at night would discourage elephants. “They also detect items such as salt kept in buildings through smell,” said an elephant expert N. Sivaganesan, who recalled how a tusker damaged an abandoned building in Dindigul district to get salt kept in gunny bags. “A newly-wed couple had kept fruits in a Forest Department guest house at Valparai where they came for honeymoon. Though the doors and windows were closed due to the low temperature, an elephant sensed the smell of fruits and damaged windows to get them,” he said. According to Mr. Sivaganesan, forest areas in Coimbatore district witness an influx of elephants from October. Various factors including grass phenology, availability of perennial water sources and green cover which is ideal for calving trigger this seasonal movement. “Elephants spread in small units in the forest division. Water storage areas of Bhavani Sagar reservoir, Pilloor reservoir and streams in the eastern slopes of the Nilgiris are among the major sources of water for them,” he said. The Forest Department has advised people living near forest areas to alert the field staff upon spotting elephants and not to venture out to chase them. While the Coimbatore Forest Division has deployed multiple ‘border night patrolling teams’ to drive out elephants, ATR is conducting night patrols in Valparai plateau through four teams.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/experts-caution-people-on-possible-encounters-with-elephants/article37695788.ece

It said that Renuka and Menaka prepared an estimation for Rs. 94.5 lakh for the work without getting a specific note order for the ratification of administrative sanction from the town panchayat council. The duo split up the works into 27 for the purpose of bringing them within the administrative power of the panchayat president, Murugesan, as he had administrative power only for the works upto Rs. 4 lakh. Mahendran accorded the technical sanction for the work, fully knowing about the absence of administrative sanction. Renuka obtained a ratification for administrative sanction through Murugesan without any previous note order, said the FIR. Renuka called for the tenders in a vernacular newspaper with minimum circulation to avoid competition and with a motive to select the favoured party in the tender. Parthipan and wife submitted their tenders and the former was subsequently awarded the work. While Parthipan laid substandard PVC pipes in contrary to the tender notification, Menaka entered incorrect details in the official records. Mahendran also took measurements of pipelines and falsely certified that the work was carried out in order. Both Menaka and Mahendran purposely omitted to point out the low quality of PVC pipes in their reports, the FIR said. The super check conducted by Srinivasan, Executive Engineer, TWAD Board, Coimbatore, found that pipes laid in the extension works were substandard. As per the FIR, Parthipan claimed Rs. 48,10,265 for the works by way of laying substandard PVC pipes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/six-booked-for-irregularities-in-pipe-laying-at-kannampalayam-town-panchayat/article37695784.ece

Three persons were arrested, while 10 others including two of the main accused and two middlemen are absconding.

26 November 2021||DINDIGUL,TAMIL NADU||Tomatoes start arriving in Dindigul||Prices of tomatoes did not come down and continued to be sold at around Rs. 65 and Rs. 75 a kg despite arrival of 42 tonnes of tomatoes from Bangaluru, said merchants at the Gandhi Market here on Thursday. Tomatoes are grown in Oddanchatram, Sanarpatti, Vadamadurai, Ayyalur, Sembatti and Palani, among other locations in the district. Most of the produce are brought to Dindigul and Oddanchatram wholesale markets, merchants said. The price touched a new high two days ago and it was sold at Rs. 80 to Rs. 90 a kg at the wholesale market. A majority of consumers, on coming to know a steep hike in the price, chose to either buy less or not to buy tomatoes. Though tomatoes have started arriving from other cities, with rain continuing in Dindigul and other parts, it was unlikely that the price may fall, a merchant said and added that only when the local producers brought their commodity to the market, the price may stabilise. Meanwhile, retail merchants from other districts, who had come to the Gandhi Market here, were seen avoiding purchase of tomatoes as they predicted a further fall in the price as the arrivals were expected to improve by Saturday. In a bid to beat the heat, the State government had directed all the district administration to open up farm fresh outlets and sell tomatoes at Rs. 45 a kg. With this, the prices may further go down. However, the traders are confident that the price may remain the same at least for the next few days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tomatoes-start-arriving-in-dindigul/article37695402.ece

Gautam Srinivas on Thursday. Demand Addressing the media at the Erode Railway Junction, Mr. Gautam Srinivas said passenger trains were stopped during COVID-19 lockdown and the railways restored the services of a few passenger trains now.  “There is a demand for operating the Salem – Coimbatore passenger train service and also the introduction of season tickets. The issue will be taken up for approval from the Railway Ministry,” he added. To a question on trains in Kerala and Karnataka being operated with general compartments while trains in the State had not done so, the DRM said the general compartments were introduced in certain routes and based on the COVID-19 situation, it would be introduced in other trains in a phased manner. Water stagnation Regarding water stagnation in railway underpasses, he said the railways had augmented pumping in the water-logging underpasses and steps were being taken to do automatic pumping wherever needed. He said a freight terminal was being planned at Ingur and once implemented, it would reduce congestion at Erode junction. There was no space for developing platforms in the Erode Railway Junction where relief accident trains were stationed and trains were examined. Inspection The DRM along with Erode MP A. Ganeshamurthi and State Highways Department engineers inspected the road underbridge near Kalaimadu Silai, to study the feasibility of widening it or to tackle congestion.

26 November 2021||Karur,TAMIL NADU||Karur MP goes on sit-in dharna at Collector’s office||The Karur Member of Parliament, S. Jothimani (Congress), along with her supporters, went on a sit-in agitation at the Karur Collector’s Office campus on Thursday demanding that the Collector T. Prabhu Shankar conduct special camps to select beneficiaries for supply of assistive devices to persons with disabilities from the Artificial Limbs Manufacturing Corporation of India (ALIMCO) in the district. Ms. Jothimani said that since he had received a lot of representations from persons with disabilities seeking assistive devices, she had requested ALIMCO to conduct special camps in Karur Parliamentary constituency for supply of assistive devices to the needy. Based on her request, the Tiruchi and Dindigul Collectors had organised such camps in areas falling under the Karur Lok Sabha constituency in the two districts. However, the Karur Collector, she alleged, was maintaining that necessary assistance would be provided to persons with disabilities under the Tamil Nadu government schemes and if there was a requirement for assistive devices, steps would be taken to conduct special camps under the auspices of the ALIMCO. Terming the Collector’s stand as intransigent and unfortunate, Ms.Jothimani went on the stir demanding that the ALIMCO camps be held in the Assembly segments in Karur LS constituency in the district. Mr. Prabhu Shankar held talks with Ms.Jothimani and explained the steps taken by him with respect to her demand. However, Ms. Jothimani continued with her dharna unsatisfied with the reply of the Collector.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/karur-mp-goes-on-sit-in-dharna/article37695353.ece
26 November 2021||KOCHI,TAMIL NADU||HC issues notices to Centre, RBI on banking amendments||The Kerala High Court on Thursday issued notices to the Centre and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on a writ petition challenging the amendments to the Banking Regulation Act which have brought the urban cooperative banks under the direct supervision of the RBI and made applicable to them the governance norms of commercial banks. The petition was filed by Thiruvalla East Cooperative Bank and Guruvayur Cooperative Urban Bank. The petitioners said the urban cooperative banks were now forced to constitute a board of management (BoM) and appoint a chief executive officer/managing director which would function as a parallel power centre along with the board of directors elected by the general body of the cooperative societies.  Mandates RBI sanction The petitioners said the RBI had issued a circular containing the procedure of appointment/termination of service of the MD/CEO, BoM and their qualifications. As per the amendments, the cooperative societies could not now amend their bylaws without the RBI approval. The amendments brought in 2020 had nullified the provisions of the Kerala Cooperative Societies (KCS) Act and Rules and the power granted to the general body of the societies as per the KCS Act. The amendments were brought on the strength of the 97th Constitutional Amendment, 2011, whereby 2nd Proviso to Article 243ZL made all the provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, applicable to all cooperative societies doing the business of banking. As a result of the amendments, the power to fix the maximum number of directors of cooperative societies and the duration of the term of office of elected members of the board of cooperative societies were now put in the hands of the Centre. The petitioners contended that the amendments had transgressed into the provisions of the KCS Act framed under item 32 on List II. Therefore, the amendments were unconstitutional.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-issues-notices-to-centre-rbi-on-banking-amendments/article37695183.ece
26 November 2021||KOCHI,TAMIL NADU||Wandering cattle to cost their owners dear||Wandering cattle in public places is probably the defining image of India in the West. But cattle owners who let that happen at Choornikkara, a quaint hamlet near Aluva in Ernakulam district of Kerala, will now have to pay a price, literally. With wandering cattle causing frequent accidents, especially involving two-wheelers, the Choornikkara panchayat committee has started slapping their owners with a fine. Five cattle were confiscated and were released only on payment of a fine of Rs. 2,500 each. The fine, however, is not restricted to cattle owners alone but to owners of any domestic animal found wandering around posing problems to the public. “The decision to impose fine was taken by the panchayat unanimously, since the menace continued despite issuing notices to dairy farmers and cattle owners not once but thrice. Wandering cattle endangering two-wheelers, especially during nights, is far too serious to be ignored,” said Raji Santhosh, Choornikkara panchayat president. The panchayat has gone one step ahead and announced a reward of Rs. 1,000 for anyone who help in confiscating such wandering animals.  The panchayat still has one cow in its custody, since its owner has not yet paid the fine. So, the matter was referred to the Aluva East police who held a meeting of all stakeholders and gave the owner time till this Saturday to pay the fine and get his animal released. “Since there is no provision in the Panchayati Raj Act for imposing fine to check the menace of wandering animals, we have created a separate account for the purpose to avoid future audit objections. Wandering cattle of owners who declined to pay the fine will be auctioned off, the proceeds from which will also go into the account. So far, the move has not drawn protest from any quarter,” said Ms. Santhosh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/wandering-cattle-to-cost-their-owners-dear/article37695185.ece
26 November 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Residents block Kappalur toll plaza against new proposal||Residents of Tirumangalam, T. Kallupatti and Peraiyur on Thursday blocked the toll plaza maintained by National Highways Authority of India at Kappalur near Tirumangalam for over 30 minutes, protesting against NHAI’s proposal to charge toll even for local vehicles that were hitherto exempted. However, after revenue and police officials held talks and assured them that toll exemption to local vehicles will continue till further orders, the protestors dispersed. A police source said that the agitators did not block emergency vehicles from passing through the toll plaza. As a precautionary measure, the police had diverted heavy vehicles and buses on Madurai-Virudhunagar highway through Tirumangalam-Ring Road and through Uchapatti. Kappalur Industrialists’ Association president P. N. Raghunatha Raja said that the very location of the toll plaza between Tirumangalam town and Madurai was in violation of the NHAI norms. “Firstly, it violated the minimum distance of 60 km between two toll plazas as the distance between Kappalur toll plaza and the one at Chittampatti on Madurai-Tiruchi highway is only 48 km,” he said. Besides, the NHAI had not obtained permission from Tirumangalam municipality for locating the toll plaza within 500 metres of the town boundary. “As per norms, the toll plaza can be located only 10 km away from any urban local body,” Mr. Raghunatha Raja said. Similarly, no toll collection facility should be located near a flyover, whereas the Kappalur toll plaza was in close proximity to a flyover. High Court order The High Court had, in the past, ordered shifting of the toll plaza to a place south of Tirumangalam town. But the NHAI had got an order in its favour misguiding the Supreme Court, he said. Tirumangalam Tahsildar A. Anandakrishnan said, “We have told the agitators that the exemption for local vehicles will continue as decided at a peace meeting chaired by the Collector.” Minister for Commercial Taxes P. Moorthi had asked NHAI officials to continue with the present arrangement so that there was no law and order problem in Tirumangalam. The issue snowballed again after the NHAI recently sought police protection for the toll plaza as it had proposed to charge all vehicles, including local vehicles, with effect from November 24.  What protesters say NHAI violated minimum distance of 60 km between two toll plazas It did not get permission to locate toll plaza within 500 metres of town boundary Against norms, it is in close proximity to a flyover||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/residents-block-kappalur-toll-plaza-against-new-proposal/article37695862.ece
26 November 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Triple murder: High Court commutes death sentence||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has commuted the death sentence imposed on a man from Tenkasi district for the murder of three members of a family in 2016 to 25-year rigorous imprisonment for three counts without any remission. The convict, N. Muthuraj alias Andavar of Nettoor near Alangulam, murdered G. Petchithai, her daughter G. Mari and Govindasamy, the father of Petchithai, on February 16, 2016. He hacked them to death with a billhook. On February 12, 2016, Muthuraj had misbehaved with one of the daughters of Petchithai. The girl was a child with special needs. Petchithai lodged a complaint with the police. Following an inquiry, Muthuraj was warned and let off. Referred to HC An angered Muthuraj hacked to death the three members of the family. The Additional District and Sessions Judge, Tenkasi, imposed the death sentence on him for three counts. The sentence was referred to the High Court for confirmation. A Division Bench of Justices V. Bharathidasan and J. Nisha Banu observed that the law is well settled that life imprisonment is the rule to which the death sentence is the exception. The death sentence must be imposed only when the life imprisonment appears to be an altogether inappropriate punishment, having regard to the relevant facts and circumstances of the case. Not warranted The court observed that death sentence is not warranted in the case. On the other hand imposing life imprisonment subject to remission is also inadequate. Therefore, the court commuted the death sentence to rigorous imprisonment for 25 years for three counts without any remission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/triple-murder-hc-commutes-death-sentence/article37695361.ece

A Division Bench of Justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P. Velmurugan sought response to the petition filed by advocate K. R. Raja of Madurai.

26 November 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Concern over rise in GST||Madurai-based Tamil Nadu Textile Merchants’ Association has made a representation to the Union government expressing concern over an increase in Goods and Services Tax (GST) from the existing 5% to 12% on textiles and garments. The increase would create a colossal negative impact and affect the textile and garment trade and industry. It would also result in closure of factories and shops and lead to unemployment of crores of people, the association said. About 85% of textile and garment shops are in the small and medium sector. Their turnover per annum was below Rs. 40 lakh. The increase in GST would be a huge burden for the small traders. The burden would be passed on to the consumers, which would cause inflation. The small and medium textile and garment retailers constitute 65 % of the Indian market and would suffer from the cutthroat competition by big conglomerates. The small and medium retailers find it difficult to even afford sufficient staff strength. The downfall of the textile and garment trade and industry would have a cascading effect on many other allied trade and industries and disrupt the economy. Any increase in GST would create a spiralling negative impact, said Association secretary Ashraf Yusuf. The Association requested the government to increase the threshold limit of GST to more than Rs. 2 crore turnover per annum and also allow inter-State transportation of goods for non-GST small traders and industries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/concern-over-rise-in-gst/article37695858.ece

The hospital moved the court accusing the commission of bias, violation of the principles of natural justice and conducting the fact-finding exercise outside its jurisdiction. The commission, represented by senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, had denied the allegation of bias.

26 November 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Overflowing sewage irks residents||Residents of several areas in Muthialpet are facing hardship due to overflowing sewage. The recent rain has further aggravated the problem with sewage overflowing even on the busy Mahatma Gandhi Road near the Perumal temple in the area. Streets such as Muthalamman Koil Street, Depsanpet, Viswanathan Nagar, Perumalpet, Belgis Street and Salai Street have been facing the problem of overflowing sewage for sometime, residents say. With dengue cases on the rise and Muthialpet being considered as one of the hotspots for the vector-borne disease, the residents feel continued neglect of the locality by the civic authorities is sure to put the lives of people at risk. “Near my house, there are at least three leaks. The road in front of my house is always filled with waste water. It is difficult for us to sit in front of the portico because of the stench and the mosquito menace,” said Iyappan, a resident of MG Road in Muthialpet. A shopowner next to his house says people are hesitant to step into the outlet because the road in front is filled with sewage. “The sewage gets stagnated for long hours especially in the morning and evening hours,” he complains. Selvi, a resident of Depsanpet, says: “Nothing has happened in years. A few metres from my house, the road is filled with sewage for a stretch. It is not just the foul smell, we have to walk through the waste water to enter the house,” she adds. She urges the government to take up the work at the earliest so that people do not suffer. Work to be taken up A senior official in the Public Works Department says the issue has been brought to their knowledge. “We will be taking up the work to provide a proper sewage network at the earliest. During the monsoon period, it is not advisable to take up such works.” The problem of overflowing sewage is only an isolated issue as a proper sewer network has been provided in the town and suburban areas. More areas are being covered, the official adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/overflowing-sewage-irks-residents/article37695644.ece

26 November 2021||Thanjavur,TAMIL NADU||Do not include input assistance in SDRF package: farmers||The Federation of Farmers Associations in Cauvery Delta Districts has called upon the Tamil Nadu government not to release the input assistance of Rs. 6,038 per hectare from the State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF). In a memorandum addressed to the State government, the Federation general secretary, Arupathi P. Kalyanam pleaded that the input cost assistance be extended from the general fund account of the government instead of from the SDRF. He also urged the Tamil Nadu government to extend Rs. 50,000 per hectare to the farmers who have lost their ‘kuruvai’ crop this season. Referring to the relief extended to delta farmers when paddy cultivation took a beating due to unexpected rains during the 2020-21 ‘samba’ season, he requested the present government to provide Rs. 20,000 per hectare for the crop which had suffered more than 33 per cent damages, Rs. 10,000 for the rain-fed crop and Rs. 25,000 for other crops. He once again reiterated his demand to modify the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (crop insurance scheme) as an incentive-based scheme where 20% compensation is assured under the insurance. Exhorting the Tamil Nadu government to pressurise the Central Government in this regard, Mr. Kalyanam pleaded that the State government might implement the incentive-based crop insurance scheme as a pilot scheme this year itself. Thanking the district administrations in the delta region for initiating timely action to get the rainwater inundating the fields drained quickly, he suggested that the Water Resources Department might acquire machinery such as floating excavators and others in order to ensure proper and quick desilting of watercourses during monsoon. It would also save the administration from spending huge amounts to carry out such works, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/do-not-include-input-assistance-in-sdrf-package-farmers/article37695373.ece

26 November 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||DGFT presence can boost export of perishable products||Exporters in central region say that a Branch Office of the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) in Tiruchi will pave way for higher volume of exports of perishable products through flight cargoes. Since May last year, there has been brisk cargo movement from Tiruchi International Airport owing to operation of non-scheduled flights, according to exporters. Perishables, agri products, food, flowers and dairy products constitute the bulk of exports from Tiruchi airport, official sources said. Prior to the pandemic, the airport used to handle about 750 tonnes of export cargo on an average every month. During 2019-20, the airport had surpassed the target of 7,500 tonnes by clocking 8,100 tonnes. “Opening a branch office of DGFT in Tiruchi will result in better hand-holding support for aspiring exporters from Tiruchi and surrounding districts,” C. Baskaran, a Tiruchi-based exporter of vegetables said. Exporters procure various kinds of vegetables from the Gandhi Market and export them the same day in a matter of hours after processing and packaging. The international cargo complex at the Tiruchi Airport has a holding capacity of 250 metric tonnes, large enough for broad-basing export activities in the region, exporters say. The third busiest airport net to Chennai and Coimbatore, Tiruchi Airport provides direct connectivity to seven international destinations, and export of perishables such as vegetables, fruits, and flowers to Singapore, Dubai, Sharjah, Abu Dhabi, Kuala Lumpur has been witnessing a steady rise. Nevertheless, the potential of Tiruchi to emerge as an export hub for perishables has not been realised well since there are no lobby groups here unlike in Coimbatore and Madurai, Mr. Baskaran observed. Earlier this year, the Central Government initiated ‘Vanijya Utsav’, covering all 739 districts of the country, for conduct of hand-holding sessions focusing on ‘From Farm to Foreign Lands’ and exporter conclaves. The DGFT was entrusted with the task of organising the Vanijya Utsav, with the support of the respective State Governments. However, there are no signs of formation or activation of District Export Promotion Committees (DEPCs) in the region, exporters rue. Under the Districts as Export Hubs initiative, the DGFT has partnered with the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) and Invest India, to provide a platform for small sellers from areas earlier not known for exports to reach out to potential importers in other countries. With a spotlight on agricultural products under five categories: spices and tea, food grains and agro-products, fruits and vegetables, dry fruits, and processed food, the DGFT has organised a few buyer-seller interactive sessions with the support of Indian Embassies from the USA, the UAE, and Japan. A few leading supermarkets such as Spinney, Walmart, and Lulu showed keen interest in India’s agricultural products.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dgft-presence-can-boost-export-of-perishable-products/article37695372.ece
26 November 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||LED lights make this roundabout brighter||Fourteen signals around the Mannarpuram roundabout have been fitted with digital LED traffic light poles. The bright lights would be visible even from a distance. Many vehicles, especially two-wheelers, complain that the traffic signal was not visible when they were caught jumping it. Officials are now happy that such complaints would not be entertained. The poles feature LED lights in the shape of an inverted letter 'L' fitted along the poles. The standard signals too remain as they indicate the direction of traffic flow along with the lights. Vehicles speeding along the highway will be able to see the signal at a distance and slow the vehicle, avoiding any mishaps. Speaking to The Hindu , a traffic policeman deputed said that the initiative, including fitting of LED lights and speaker systems playing soothing music was an attempt to streamline the traffic flow in the city. It would make the roads safer, he said. The LED light poles have been installed on the signals surrounding the Mannarpuram roundabout on a trial basis, and would be extended to other crowded signals in the city soon. A city-based tech company has sponsored the signals on a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/led-lights-make-this-roundabout-brighter/article37695367.ece
26 November 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Make Kumbakonam a new district, traders urge CM||The Federation of All Traders Associations of Kumbakonam has urged Chief Minister M. K. Stalin to fulfil his election promise to create a new district with the town as the headquarters. “While campaigning at Thirukadaiyur and Orthanadu in the run-up to the Assembly election, Mr. Stalin, as the then leader of Opposition, had promised to initiate steps to form the new district once the DMK returned to power to meet the expectations of the people of the region. We request the Chief Minister to make the announcement on the creation of the new district at the earliest,” said a resolution adopted at the executive committee meeting of the federation held in Kumbakonam recently. With Kumbakonam being a major commercial hub in the delta region, the demand for creation of a new district had grown popular over the past three decades. The demand to make Kumbakonam division, covering Kumbakonam, Tiruvidaimarudur and Papanasam Assembly segments, a new district has grown shriller in recent years. The town residents had intensified their efforts and staged many protests including a hartal called by the Coordination Committee for Formation of Kumbakonam District. The issue was raised even at a recent public hearing on the expansion and upgradation of the Kumbakonam municipality as a Corporation. Residents were not happy over the upgradation saying that what they wanted was a new district and not an upgraded civic body. “The federation has been lobbying for the cause for the past thirty years. Kumbakonam MLA G. Anbalagan has also been pressing for the demand besides the local Bar association, social organisations and representatives of all political parties,” the resolution adopted at the meeting said. The federation also pointed out that voters in Kumbakonam constituency have been consistently returning DMK candidates in the Assembly elections for the past several years, expect in 1991. Hence the Chief Minister has the responsibility to fulfil the demand of the people of Kumbakonam, the resolution said.

The protesters also demanded that Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation Limited (TASMAC) shops be shut as many men consume alcohol and harass their wives and other family members. The Bharathisadan University, Indian Association of Women's Studies, Regional Association for Women Studies and All India Women's Studies Students Forum kicked off a 16-day webinar series to commemorate the day. Each day, one university from across the country would host the programme, which would culminate on Human Rights Day- 10 December. On Thursday, N.

A. Saravanan, who lived in Karur with his family, worked in the same school where a girl of Class XII, who was found dead in her house recently, studied.

He wrote that he felt ashamed. “I have not done anything wrong. I do not know why they are doing this,” the note read. Police sources said Saravanan, a postgraduate, with a bachelor’s degree in education, had sought permission from the school, citing his mother’s ill health, and come to his father-in-law’s house in Sengattupatti on Wednesday.

26 November 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||‘Pisanam’ paddy cultivation to meet target this year||‘Pisanam’ paddy cultivation in Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi and Tenkasi districts is all set to surpass target this season, thanks to the active northeast monsoon that has ensured excellent water storage in all dams and tanks. As the northeast monsoon has increased water level in Papanasam, Servalar and Manimuthar dams, cultivation of paddy during this ‘pisanam’ season has been actively taken up. While Papanasam and Servalar dams are about to reach their maximum storage level, Manimuthar dam, the largest reservoir of the district, now has 93 feet water (about 55%) against its maximum storage level of 118 feet. With the rain continuing in the dam’s catchment areas, the reservoir is expected to overflow before mid-December. Joint Director of Agriculture (Tirunelveli) Gajendra Pandian told The Hindu that raising of paddy nursery and cultivation of paddy had been completed on over 15,000 hectares against the target of 30,000 hectares. “We are hopeful of surpassing the target this year as almost all waterbodies – both systemised and rain-fed tanks – are either overflowing or about to attain the maximum storage level now and storage in major reservoirs is also satisfactory. Since the rain continues, we are hopeful of having bumper ‘summer crop’ also this year,” said Mr. Gajendra Pandian. In Thoothukudi distric, too, almost all waterbodies in Tamirabharani irrigation system are overflowing. Similarly, the tanks under Korampallam and Vaippaar basins and the rain-fed tanks have 90% water. Cultivation of paddy has so far been completed on 1,100 hectares against the target of 10,000 hectares. “Since the conditions prevailing in the district is favouable, paddy nurseries have been raised even in the rain-fed areas where wells are brimming with water. We are hopeful of surpassing the target,” said S.I. Mohideen, Joint Director of Agriculture. In both the districts, steps have been taken to ensure the unhindered supply of certified seeds of Ambai 16, TPS 5, PPT 5204, NLR 34449 and TKM 13 and chemical fertilizers to farmers. Chemical nutrients such as urea, potash and complex have been stocked sufficiently, the officials said. However, the farmers are a bit worried about the short supply of di-ammonium phosphate, which is being sold at the market at inflated price. “While the prescribed price is Rs. 1,200 per 50 kg bag, it is being sold at Rs. 1,450 and above due to short supply,” said farmers N. Balamurugan from Cheranmahadevi and P. Balasurbamanian from Shencottai. The officials, however, say the farmers should produce their Aadhaar cards while buying chemical fertilizers through ‘point of sale’ to weed out the issue of inflated sale of fertilizers. According to Mr. Gajendra Pandian and Mr. Mohideen, surprise raids are being conducted to check the quality agriculture inputs, including seeds, pesticides and fertilizers, and the sale of fertilizers at an inflated price will lead to cancellation of licence if the affected farmers register complaint. “We have cancelled the licence of three shops while explanation has been sought from five others for irregularities,” said Mr. Mohideen. In Tenkasi district, water level in Gadana, Ramanadhi, Karuppanadhi and Adavinainar dams is nearing the maximum storage level, while Gundar dam, the smallest reservoir with a height of 36 feet, is overflowing. Consequently, farming operations, especially, ‘pisanam’ season paddy cultivation has gathered momentum.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pisanam-paddy-cultivation-to-meet-target-this-year/article37695692.ece

The PWD and Corporation officials are attending to it,” M. Varadaraj Suresh, Archaeological Officer, ASI (Vellore), told The Hindu . The temple was flooded for the first time since 1995 mainly because of the moat that reached its full capacity last week.

On Friday, Kanniyakumari, Tirunelveli and Thenkasi may record heavy to very heavy rain at one or two places. While most other places are likely to get moderate rain, 10 districts, including Chennai, Madurai, Pudukottai, and Puducherry, may have to be prepared for heavy rain at isolated places. The rainfall may turn more intense in Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts on Saturday and Sunday. Heavy rain is likely to lash more than 15 districts, including the Cauvery delta districts, Chengalpattu, the Nilgiris, Salem, Erode and Puducherry, on Saturday. Chennai may experience heavy rain in some areas till the weekend. Officials said the cyclonic circulation at the lower tropospheric levels and the strong north-easterly winds prevailing over the Tamil Nadu coast at the lower level would push moisture and rain clouds towards the State. S. Balachandran, Deputy Director-General of Meteorology, Chennai, said conditions were not favourable for the circulation over the Bay to consolidate and intensify further. The broad low would still influence the spell of heavy rain. A trough line from the weather system along the coast extending up to the northern districts would also sustain the wet spell over Tamil Nadu till November-end. Another low-pressure area is brewing. It is likely to form over the south Andaman sea around November 29. This may become more marked in the next two days. But it has to be monitored for its impact on Tamil Nadu, officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/heavy-rain-may-continue-till-month-end/article37695323.ece

26 November 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Nomination papers of Independent rejected||There are eight candidates in the fray for the Legislative Council polls from the two-member local bodies constituency of Belagavi, after officials rejected the nomination papers of one candidate and another withdrew his. The officials rejected the nomination papers of Independent candidate Nagappa Kalasannanavar on technical grounds. The nomination papers of the other nine candidates were found to be in order. However, on Thursday, Jagadish Kavatagimath, brother of BJP candidate Mahantesh Kavatagimath, withdrew in favour of his brother. Jagadish Kavatagimath was a “dummy” candidate who filed his nomination papers to stay in the race, in case his brother’s papers were to be rejected for some reason. Those left in the race, other than Mahantesh Kavatagimath, are Channaraj Hattiholi, Congress nominee and brother of Lakshmi Hebbalkar, MLA, and Lakhan Jarkiholi, who is fighting the elections as an Independent. Leaders are sweating it out in the field, each asking for votes for their favoured nominees. The Jarkiholi brothers, however, are facing the charge that they are trying to discretely help their younger brother. Ramesh Jarkiholi, family patriarch and BJP leader, has been holding meetings in villages in Gokak and surrounding areas. He has openly announced that he will work for the BJP and that he never sought ticket for his brother [Lakhan Jarkiholi]. He accompanied Mahantesh Kavatagimath when he filed his nomination papers two days ago. Balachandra Jarkiholi was not among those who accompanied Mahantesh Kavatagimath. He has, however, been addressing rallies in Mudalagi and Gokak in favour of the BJP, even before the candidates were finalised. The stand of Satish Jarkiholi is also under public gaze after he said that the Congress will fight only for one seat as it cannot win both. His party respected his stand and nominated only Mr. Hattiholi. Satish Jarkiholi accompanied the Congress candidate when the latter filed his nomination papers and has been speaking at party rallies. Even on Thursday, Satish Jarkiholi, who is the KPCC working president, addressed rallies in Raibag and Kudchi. He asked gram panchayat and municipal body members to vote for the Congress, irrespective of which leader meets whom. “Lakhan Jarkioli is meeting Sham Ghatage, former MLA from the Congress.

26 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Concreting drains not the answer to flooding: Experts||Environmentalists and urban planning experts are critical of the State Government’s plan to reinforce storm-water drains with concrete, one of the measures announced, to mitigate flooding during the monsoon. Experts with whom The Hindu spoke, said concrete drains would serve no purpose apart from increasing the speed of water flow. The need of the hour is a more integrated and holistic approach for proper water management, they said. After visiting the flood-hit areas over the last two days, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai announced a master plan to strengthen the SWD network by widening them, using reinforced cement concrete and also building new drains. Bengaluru has over 840-km of canals, which later became SWD, that were natural drainage pathways, linking lakes and taking the excess water eventually to the rivers. Kshitij Urs, adjunct professor of public policy, National Law School of India University, said the World Bank had normalised the concretisation of drains, but it was not the solution to Bengaluru’s problems. “In Singapore, concrete drains have a utilitarian role. The drains take the rain water to the sea. Bengaluru is different as the drains are connected to natural river valleys. These river valleys have many ecological roles and just reinforcing them with concrete serves no real purpose,” he said. The move, he added, contradicted the Government’s earlier stand of rejuvenating valleys and afforesting them. Prof. M. Inayatulla, Director, Water Institute, University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering (UVCE), Bangalore University, said the carrying capacity of the drain network and volume of discharge should be recomputed. “We need to also study the land-use pattern along the drain network and changes in climate pattern, besides taking up an integrated effort to rejuvenate the four valleys in the city – Hebbal, Koramangala, Challaghatta and Vrushabhavathi,” he said. Leo Saldanha of Environment Support Group (ESG) argued that the city’s flooding problems could have been solved had the Government implemented the guidelines of Justice N.K. Patil Committee Report on management and rehabilitation of lakes. The report of the committee that was set up by the High Court of Karnataka in response to a petition by the Environment Support Group was accepted by the court and the Government around 10 years ago, said Mr. Saldanha. “The Government is actually in contempt of court for failing to implement the guidelines of the report.” He stated that the Government was “weaponising water” by deciding to reinforce drains with concrete. The problem of flooding, he said, will not be solved but shifted to another place. “If the canal system is maintained as envisaged in the N.K. Patil report, we will have beautiful ribbons of greenery that will not just improve the city’s biodiversity, but also recharge groundwater. Else, flooding will become a common phenomenon across the city,” he added. Veena Srinivasan, hydrologist from Ashoka Trust For Research In Ecology And The Environment (ATREE), said cities across the world were looking at ways to hold water, when on the contrary, the Government was looking at increasing the speed of water flow. “We need integrated planning and political will to bring together all agencies involved in water management, not ‘bandaid solutions’. We can work together on solutions where the drains can be made part of the city’s architecture, besides using them to better manage water resources,” she said.  “In Singapore concrete drains have a utilitarian role. The drains take the rain water to the sea. Bengaluru is different as the drains are connected to natural river valleys.

26 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Officials had wealth 77-879% over known sources of income’||A day after the Anti-Corruption Bureau seized movable and immovable properties from 15 government officials across the State, officials conducted initial evaluation: the amassed wealth allegedly ranged between 77-879% disproportionate to their known sources of income. Hundreds of ACB officials and personnel carried out simultaneous operations at 68 locations and seized gold, silver, cash documents related to properties and bank records. While a section of officials began to assess the value of the seized properties, other teams continued the operations on Thursday opening bank lockers belonging to the officials. “The estimation was done based on the documents produced by the accused officials and information gathered from various sources,” said the ACB. As per their estimation, Vasudev R.N., former project director of Nirmithi Kendra in Bangalore Rural District, had assets over Rs. 18.2 crore , which is 879.53% in excess of known sources of income, said the ACB. Teams had searched six places during the raid on Vasudev and had found documents related to five houses and eight sites in Bengaluru, four other houses in Sompura, 10.20 acres of agricultural land in Nelamangala and Magadi taluks, 850 grams of gold, 9.5 kg of silver, Rs. 15 lakh cash, household goods worth Rs. 98 lakh. Junior engineer of the Public Works Department, S.M. Biradar, who had stashed cash in a drainage pipe at his house in Kalaburagi, allegedly has assets that are 406.17% disproportionate to his known sources of income. His assets are valued at over Rs. 4.15 crore. The ACB estimated that T.S. Rudreshappa, joint director of agriculture in Gadag, has assets worth Rs. 6.65 core, 400% more than his known source of income. While L.C. Nagaraj, administrative officer, Sakala Mission, accumulated assets worth Rs. 10.82 crore which is disproportionate by 198%. Similarly, group 'D' worker at a BBMP High School, GV Giri, has assets valued at Rs. 6.24 crore, 563.85% disproportionate to his known sources of income. While the ACB continues the probe, the accused officials will now have to defend themselves by producing documents and explaining the source of each and every article seized.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/officials-had-wealth-77-879-over-known-sources-of-income/article37695278.ece
26 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Bommai orders probe into contract works||Taking serious note of the letter written by Karnataka State Contractors’ Association to Prime Minister Narendra Modi alleging that contractors in the State were forced to pay a bribe of upto 40% of the project cost to government officers and elected representatives to get their dues cleared, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai on Thursday said he had instructed Chief Secretary P. Ravi Kumar to conduct an inquiry to inquire into any lapses in awarding contractors. “I have ordered the Chief Secretary to scrutinise tenders through heads of departments and probe if any lapses are found in awarding of contracts,” Mr. Bommai told presspersons after the Cabinet meeting here. The Chief Minister said he had written to the Chief Secretary to conduct a special scrutiny of tenders, if any, finalised after his government came to power. On July 6, the Karnataka State Contractors’ Association wrote to Mr. Modi alleging that contractors were forced to pay a bribe of up to 40% of the project cost to officers and elected representatives. All contents of the letter would be inquired into, he said. “Why they sent the letter there [to PM], I do not know,” the Chief Minister said. He said all irregularities would be known when the probe was conducted. The association’s letter was “very general” and does not cite specific instances, Mr. Bommai said. To ensure transparency, he said, an electronic system would be created for raising automatic bills based on the seniority of contractors and projects. Tenders would be cleared on time as delay would give rise to many suspicions, he said. Mr. Bommai said the Chief Secretary has been told to issue government orders soon for constituting two tenders committees headed by a retired judge of the High Court to estimate and decide conditions for tenders. The State Cabinet recently took a decision to constitute two committees to check unrealistic estimation of tender amounts by various government departments and agencies in tenders. Under the new rule, no tenders would be invited above Rs. 50 crore without clearance by committees. Committees would scrutinise all tender proposals of all departments and only after the scrutiny, the departments would be allowed to float tenders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bommai-orders-probe-into-contract-works/article37695288.ece
26 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC stays probe against Bengaluru police chief in Jarkiholi case||In a relief to city Police Commissioner Kamal Pant and two other officers, the High Court of Karnataka on Thursday stayed the direction of a magistrate court ordering investigation against them for allegedly delaying registration of a first information report (FIR) in the case of sexual abuse of a woman allegedly involving former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi. The High Court also stayed the investigation ordered against Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central) M.N. Anucheth and Cubbon Park police inspector Maruti. Justice Sreenivas Harish Kumar passed the interim order on the petition filed by the three police officers questioning the November 23 order passed by the VIII Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bengaluru, on a private complaint by social activist Adarsh R. Iyer. Observing that the complainant appeared to be unaware of the proceedings pending before the High Court on the investigation carried out by the police on the CD scandal, the High Court said that the probe ordered by the magistrate did not appear to be proper. Third party Advocate P. Prasanna Kumar, appearing for the police officers, contended that the complainant was a third party and his grievance was that the police had not registered an FIR based on a complaint filed by Dinesh Kallahalli, another social activist. It was also pointed out to the High Court that the complainant had not brought to the notice of the magistrate that the FIR was registered later based on the complaint filed by the victim through her lawyer, and a Division Bench, headed by the Chief Justice of the High Court, had been monitoring the progress of the investigation on the petitions filed by victim. Restraint order The police had not filed the final report of the investigation in view of restraint order passed by the Division Bench, and the complainant, being a social activist, should have brought these aspects to the notice of the magistrate as the Division Bench’s directions were widely reported in media, it was argued on behalf of the police officers. It had been pointed out that the police could not register an FIR based on Mr. Kallahalli’s complaint owing to lack of information.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-stays-probe-against-bengaluru-police-chief-in-jarkiholi-case/article37695282.ece
26 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||NK districts consistently reporting zero cases||Eight districts in Karnataka have been consistently reporting zero COVID-19 cases. Although districts such as Haveri, Shivamogga, Chickballapur, Bengaluru Rural, Davangere and Kolar have also reported zero cases on some days, eight districts - Bagalkot, Ballari, Bidar, Kalaburagi, Koppal, Raichur, Vijayapura, and Gadag - have seen nil cases in the last one week. Bengaluru Urban alone has been adding over 60% of the total daily cases reported in the State while 17 districts have been reporting cases in single digits. All the districts have been reporting a Test Positivity Rate (TPR) of less than 1% with Mysuru, Bengaluru Urban, Tumakuru, Kodagu, and Udupi having a TPR that is higher than the State average of 0.32. Zero TPR While Bagalkot has been consistently recording zero TPR for the last one week, districts such as Belagavi, Chickballapur, Vijayapura, Ramanagaram, Bidar, Gadag, Koppal, Raichur, Haveri, Kalaburagi, and Yadgir have been reporting a TPR of less than 0.5%. C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, said the low rate of infection in North Karnataka districts is no reason to celebrate as of now as the rate of vaccination in these districts is low. “There is a need to increase testing and vaccination in these districts as only vaccination can reduce hospitalisation and disease severity. In case if there is a fresh surge, the unvaccinated population will be the worst affected,” he said. Testing strategy State Health Commissioner D. Randeep said the department has sought the opinion of the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on whether the testing strategy in these districts should be revised. “There is some debate that we are not testing enough in these districts. We have asked the TAC if the revised number of 60,000 tests in the State is enough or we need to increase the tests, especially in the districts that have been reporting zero cases,” he said. The Commissioner said he will have a video-conference with the DCs and District Health Officers on Monday or Tuesday to discuss if the testing strategy has to be revised in these districts. “With no cases being reported, it may be difficult for targeted testing of contacts and symptomatic people. We may have to intensify random testing, especially among street vendors, auto and bus drivers, students and inmates of hostels. Even after doing this, if there are no cases then we can conclude that these districts have entered the endemic phase,” he added.

26 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Govt. urged to provide eggs in midday meals across State||Activists, parents, and teachers have demanded that the government extend its initiative to provide eggs with midday meals to all districts in the State and not just those that have reported higher levels of malnutrition. Public health activist Sylvia Karpagam said pre-lockdown statistics of stunting and under-nutrition as well as anaemia should set alarm bells ringing “The State really needs to look at whether ideology/prejudice or nutritional concerns should direct nutritional policies for children. In Karnataka, 35.4% children under five years are stunted, and 32.9% are underweight,” she said. The Department of Public Instruction on Wednesday had issued a circular stating that eggs should be provided to students from Classes I to VIII in seven districts, a move that will benefit around 14.44 lakh children. Schools will be provided eggs 12 days a month, which would mean that students would get it three times a week. Students who do not eat eggs will be given bananas. Ms. Karpagam said Karnataka would need an allocation of Rs. 370 crore for three eggs a week and Rs. 617 crore for five eggs a week. G.B. Siddalingappa, State president, Karnataka Rajya Shala Abhiruddhi Samanvaya Vedike, said: “All children need nutritious food. We demand that this is extended to all schools in the State. Teachers and health experts are urging the government to find a better source of protein for children who do not eat eggs. R. Vishal, Commissioner for Public Instruction, said the department was looking at a protein alternative. “We examined the possibility of giving protein biscuits or ladoos to students but they come with high sugar content so we avoided it. We will provide bananas till we find a better supplement,” he said. The Commissioner also said that they would study the pilot done in seven districts and if the results were positive, they would urge the State Government to extend it to the rest of Karnataka.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-urged-to-provide-eggs-in-midday-meals-across-state/article37695295.ece
26 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Kickback charge: Cong. seeks President’s Rule in State||The Opposition Congress on Thursday called on Governor Thaawarchand Gehlot and submitted a petition seeking imposition of President’s Rule invoking Article 356 of the Constitution of India for failure of constitutional machinery in the State, referring to the Karnataka State Contractors’ Association allegations on payment of a bribe of up to 40% of the project cost to government officers and elected representatives to get their dues. In a petition to the Governor, the Congress said the Karnataka State Contractors’ Association alleged about rampant corruption in various departments such as Public Works Department, Minor and Major Irrigation, Panchayat Raj, Health and Medical Education, and BBMP etc., and for every work, the contractors have to pay more than 40% commission to Ministers, legislators, and officials of the departments. The association is a registered body having about one lakh contractors membership, the Congress said. “The Prime Minister has become silent about this rampant corruption amounting to several thousand crores and by not initiate any action on the Government of Karnataka even after lapse of more than four months from the submission of the above said memorandum by the contractors’ association,” the Congress said. “So far, no action has been initiated in this issue, which shows both State and Central Governments have compromised with the corruption,” the petition added. The petition also cited the recent raids on BDA offices. The Congress also sought a probe by a sitting judge of the Supreme Court into the allegations of corruption. A Congress delegation led by Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah and KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar met the Governor in this regard. Mr. Siddaramaiah said cases should be booked under the Money Laundering Act against officials and elected representatives seeking bribe on contract works.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kickback-charge-cong-seeks-presidents-rule-in-state/article37695292.ece

Chinnaswamy Stadium to rigorous life imprisonment. The court had earlier sentenced them to seven years imprisonment. The Central Crime Branch of the Bengaluru police had appealed against the sentence in the High Court which after a hearing remitted the matter back to the session courts for fresh consideration, a senior police officer said.

The two bombs exploded injuring 15 people, including policemen. Delhi police arrested the accused and handed them over to the CCB after confirming their role in the stadium blast case. The accused confessed that they stayed in a rented house in Tumakuru for a month and assembled the bombs from explosive material provided to them by IM operatives.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/life-term-for-2-in-stadium-blast-case/article37695259.ece

Justice N.S. Sanjay Gowda passed the order while allowing the petition filed by the minor through her mother. The petitioners had approached the court after the medical practitioner and the Belagavi district hospital refused to terminate the pregnancy citing provisions of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971. “The minor needs termination as continuing pregnancy endangers the mother physically and mentally with risk as explained by the gynaecologist and psychiatrist,” said the report of the medical board, set up by Belagavi district surgeon on directions of the High Court. The court noted that the paediatrician, who was part of the medical board, opined that it would be a high-risk pregnancy as the survivor is a teenage mother and it would also pose grave risk to the foetus. Mental state factored in The court took into consideration the view of the psychiatrist, who pointed out that if the pregnancy was continued, the petitioner would develop anxiety and could lead to definite depression. Citing the apex court’s decisions equating women’s right to reproduction with the right to personal liberty guaranteed under Constitution of India, the court observed that “The consequences of continuing the pregnancy on the future life of the 16-year-old would be quite severe and detrimental to a dignified life as contemplated under Article 21 of the Constitution.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-permits-minor-rape-survivor-to-terminate-25-week-pregnancy/article37695293.ece

This decision was taken after reports of private school managements refusing to issue certificates, forcing parents to turn to the government for help. Since the start of the academic year, parents have been complaining to the Department of Public Instruction that private school managements were not issuing transfer certificates when they moved their children as they could not afford to pay fees. The circular issued by the Department of Public Instruction stated that parents who have withdrawn their children from the private unaided schools should approach the school for a transfer certificate. “School managements must issue TC within a week and in case of delay, parents can file a complaint before the jurisdictional BEO, who should ensure the parent/child gets the TC,” read the circular. The Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools have threatened to stage a protest, if the department does not withdraw the circular. D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary of the association, said TCs had not been given to students whose parents had not cleared pending fees. “If BEOs issue the TC, school managements will face losses,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/beos-asked-to-issue-tcs-if-pvt-schools-dont-comply/article37695272.ece

Though he apologised for the comments, two cases were registered against him at Basavanagudi police station a week ago. High drama prevailed in front of the station when members of a right-wing group and another group comprising supporters of the music director gathered outside. One group shouted slogans against Hamsalekha and actor ‘Ahimsa’ Chetan who had accompanied him in a show of support. The other group chanted slogans supporting the music director. “The situation was tense for some time, but we convinced both groups to maintain peace and not cause a law and order situation,” said the police. A senior police officer said that an investigation officer recorded Hamsalekha’s statement. “He was questioned about the remarks he made in his speech at an awards ceremony in Mysuru. He clarified that he had no intention to hurt any person or group, and had apologised for it a day later,” said the police. At the ceremony, while talking about the late seer’s visit to a Dalit house, Hamsalekha had said that while an “upper caste” person’s visit to a Dalit’s house was celebrated, the more important question was if it would also work in the reverse. He had also asked if “upper caste” people would partake of the food consumed by Dalits during such visits. A video of the clip went viral, following which the music director released a video apologising for his remarks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hamsalekha-questioned-for-remarks/article37695276.ece

On Tuesday night, when he went to open the water valve around 9.30 p.m. in a five-ft deep chamber, he started frothing and fell unconscious. He was pulled out and taken to a hospital where doctors declared him brought dead. He had allegedly not been provided with any safety gear despite the fact that it was doing a high-risk job. His father, Varadappa, who filed a complaint with the police, said forcing a minor to do such a high-risk job without providing any safety gear was a serious crime.

The SSK Savji Hotel Owners Association has come up with the mobile application, Savji Foodie, which will help connoisseurs of food to order Savji dishes and get them delivered home. The association has also come up with its own mechanism to identify authentic Savji Food outlets and give them the logo that certifies their authenticity. The Savji Foodie App has been developed by Hubballi Savji Foods Private Limited and covers authentic Savji food outlets in Hubballi. The logo has the photograph of Sahasrarjun Maharaj, deity worshipped by SSK community. “The traditional Savji food is prepared by members of the community, using home-made mix of spices. However, of late, people other than those from SSK community are found using the ‘Savji Food’ tagline to sell dishes that are not authentically Savji,” SSK Savji Hotel Owners Association president Ramchandra Habib said. Mr. Habib said that Savji food is purely home-made and does not use any artificial flavours. The idea of having the logo is to recognise authentic food outlets, he said. The association has also appointed delivery boys to ensure that the traditional Savji food reaches customers in time. In Hubballi, there are roughly around 80 authentic Savji food outlets. The mobile application and the logo were launched in Hubballi on Tuesday. The association plans to expand the service to Gadag and Bagalkot soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/savji-foodie-app-launched-for-authentic-cuisine/article37695423.ece
26 November 2021||Kalaburagi,KARNATAKA||Eggs will boost attendance: Teachers||Karnataka Government’s decision to include eggs and bananas in midday meals in schools in seven backward districts – Bidar, Kalaburagi, Yadgir, Raichur, Koppal, Ballari (and Vijayanagara), and Vijayapura – that have reported rampant malnutrition among children has evoked an overwhelmingly positive response from teachers and parents. “I conducted a survey in my school and found that 162 of 166 children eat eggs. Inclusion of egg is expected to increase children’s attendance,” said Raghavendra, headmaster of Government Higher Primary School at Puchhaladinni, Raichur district. Manohar, assistant headmaster at a government school at Janti in Bhalki taluk of Bidar district, said: “Since there is a provision to give bananas to students who don’t eat eggs, there will be no opposition from vegetarian parents too.” The circular issued by the Commissioner of Public Instruction says eggs and bananas are for students studying in Classes I to VIII. This has created some confusion among high school teachers. “Leaving out students of Classes IX and X does not look nice. We will seek clarification from higher officers,” a teacher from Kalaburagi district said. Nalin Atul, Additional Commissioner of Public Instruction (Kalaburagi Division), said he would explore all possibilities to extend the scheme to Classes IX and X too. “When the Union Government started the midday meal scheme, it was meant for children of Classes I to VIII. But, the Karnataka Government added Classes IX and X to the scheme spending from its exchequer. I expect similar development in the inclusion of egg and banana. For districts in Kalyana Karnataka, we take help from the Kalyana Karnataka Region Development Board,” Mr. Atul told The Hindu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/eggs-will-boost-attendance-teachers/article37695285.ece
26 November 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Emotions run high as police return stolen valuables||Poojita from Bejai Kapikad could hardly control her emotions while receiving the gold chain that her father had lost in November last year from Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra and Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar here on Thursday. “My father died a few days ago,” she said and added that her father failed to recover from the injury that he suffered in an assault by the accused who took away his gold chain. The accused assaulted Poojita’s father after giving him liquor to consume when he was on his way to the KSRTC bus stand to catch a bus to Madikeri for a family function. “It was a serious injury and despite an year-long treatment, he did not recover,” she said. Two months ago, the Mangaluru East Police arrested the accused and recovered the gold chain. After court permission, Poojita and her relative Arun Kumar received the gold chain from the police on Thursday. These two were among the few who received their lost articles during a programme organised by the police to display valuables worth Rs. 2.9 crore recovered from 726 persons arrested in connection with 347 cases of chain snatching and other property theft cases detected during 2020 and 2021. Dhanalakshmi, a resident of Ullal, lauded the team of police personnel from Ullal for tracing the accused within three months of theft of her gold chain, three mobile phones and Rs. 5,000 in cash from her house. “I don't know the names of the personnel, but they have worked hard to trace the accused,” she said. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Hariram Shankar said that police personnel have worked hard to trace the accused in theft cases in which the police had literally no clue about those involved. “We know the pain the victims have gone through. We strived to trace those involved,” he said. Of the 353 cases reported in 2020, The police have so far detected 212 cases. Of the 277 cases reported so far this year, the police have detected 137 cases. Among the recovered property included, 105 two-wheelers, 20 four-wheelers, a lorry, 135 mobile phones, 20.490 kg of silver articles, 3.598 kg of gold ornaments and Rs. 38.67 lakh in cash. Notable among the recovered property that were displayed included the recent seizure of currency with a face value of Rs. 1.9 crore in the denomination of the banned Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes. The police also displayed 52 high-end mobile phones worth Rs. 1.5 crore that were recently stolen from a mobile phone store. “This display and return of stolen goods is meant to bring the police closer to people,” said Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/emotions-run-high-as-police-return-stolen-valuables/article37695877.ece
26 November 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||The tale of stolen property||“I was stolen from Beluvai village near Moodbidri on April 27, 2021. The police got me released from the clutches of thieves and handed me over to the safe hands of my owner.” This was on the banner titled “Nanna Kathe” which was on a truck that was among several articles displayed by the police at the Town Hall here on Thursday. “To make people aware about crime, we gave life to these recovered property to tell their tale,” said Assistant Commissioner of Police (Traffic) M.A. Nataraj. In the banner related to vehicles involved in accidents in which vehicles had no insurance cover, the narration contained the number of people who died and also that they were now awaiting auction. “This fate should not come to others,” said the last line of these banners before stating the need for all vehicles to have insurance over. Apart from display of property related to theft and other offences, the police had put up stalls to display activities of the Police Department, including Cyber Cell, Anti Sabotage Squad, 112 Emergency Response Support System and Traffic Management System.

26 November 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Sugarcane FRP inadequate, say farmers; seek better deal||Farmers have expressed their disapproval of the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) for sugarcane fixed by the Centre and aver that it does not meet even the input cost. The State Sugarcane Cultivators Association president Kurubur Shanthakumar told media persons here on Thursday that the Centre has announced an FRP of Rs. 2,900 per tonne and this is a nominal increase of Rs. 50 per tonne based on 10 per cent recovery, over the previous years. “But the cost of cultivation has increased to Rs. 3,200 per tonne and we are seeking an FRP which factors in the increase apart from a marginal income for the farmers’’, said Mr. Shanthakumar. Meanwhile, the Association has also alleged that the farmers tend to be taken for a ride by the sugar factories which consistently cite a lower recovery to deny the farmers their due. Hence the association sought a transparent mechanism in assessment of the recovery rate, which, they suspect, was being fudged by the sugar factories. Mr. Shanthakumar said that in addition to increasing the FRP, the farmers in the State are yet to receive the arrears of the previous years due to them from the factories and this should be cleared at the earliest. When COVID-19 had already taken a toll on the farmers, the low FRP will only push the cultivators to the brink. Hence Mr. Shanthakumar called for review and revision of the FRP for sugarcane besides demanding that the cost of transportation of sugarcane from the field to the factory be borne by the latter. The Association also reiterated its long pending demand that the farmers should be given a share in the revenue earned by the factories from the sugarcane by-products as well. Urging the State Government to open paddy procurement centres at hobli levels, the Association wanted all variety of paddy to be procured by the State and cited the example of Telangana in this regard. Referring to the Centre’s decision to repeal the three contentious farm laws, Mr. Shanthakumar said this has infused strength and new dynamism to the farmers’ movement in the country. But the agitation which lasted more than an year also saw the death of nearly 700 farmers and the Government should pay compensation to the tune of Rs. 25 lakh for the family members of each of the deceased. Though Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced doubling of farmers’ income by 2022, the situation has come to such a pass that the average monthly income of the farmers is Rs. 3,700 compared to the daily wagers who earn more. Hence it is imperative for the Centre to ensure statutory guarantee of Minimum Support Price which is also the key demand of the farmers, said Mr. Shanthakumar.  Centre has announced an FRP of Rs. 2,900 per tonne, a nominal increase of Rs. 50 per tonne based on 10 per cent recovery, over the previous years, says State Sugarcane Cultivators Association president Kurubur Shanthakumar||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sugarcane-frp-inadequate-say-farmers-seek-better-deal/article37695531.ece
26 November 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘Traditional foods boost health’||On the occasion of 6th Ayurveda Day (Sri Dhanvantri Jayanti), the Department of Food Science and Nutrition, Yuvaraja’s College, University of Mysore, and other associations in association with the Department of AYUSH, Government of Karnataka, organised a workshop on traditional food practices here on Thursday. The event marked the department’s 25th anniversary. Congratulating the department on its silver jubilee and also inaugurating the workshop, University of Mysore Vice-Chancellor G. Hemantha Kumar spoke about various traditional foods that are commonly consumed in the country having health benefits.These foods could help prevent some serious ailments. The VC cited the examples of ambali, a finger millet-based fermented semi-liquid food preparation consumed by the people in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu and is considered a geriatric food because of the presence of high calcium and low-resistant starch in finger millet. It consists of sufficient amount of calcium and is a healthy drink for elderly persons. Referring to “ragi hurihittu”, he said it is the flour of popped finger millet rich in dietary fibres and nutrients. Popping is a simple processing technique done by severe heat treatment. It can be used for the preparation of dietetic foods for anaemia and geriatric food formulation, Prof. Kumar said in his inaugural address. He said idli provides complimentary proteins as it is prepared from the fermented product using rice and black gram batter with steam cooking. Dosa is also a fermented dish and more digestible and nutritionally dense and therefore recommended for elderly persons and children below 10 years of age. “Bale dindu palya (curry made from banana stem) is recommended for diabetic patients and also for those suffering from stomach ailments,” he said, besides speaking about the benefits of foods like “basale soppu palya”, “tambuli”, “ondelaga chutney”, bamboo shoot curry, “dhokla” and others. The VC said several studies have pointed out that various compounds found in turmeric, black pepper, garlic, basil, cardamom etc., help reduce risk of cancer and affect tumour behaviour. “A well-curated Indian diet can help control blood sugar levels. A study shows that Indian foods can help reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and is suitable for individuals who already have diabetes.” The controlled use of healthy spices and herbs help fight inflammation throughout the body and lower blood pressure, besides reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and various other heart-related conditions, he claimed. Former CFTRI Director V. Prakash also spoke on the occasion. B.N. Yashoda, Principal, Yuvaraja College, Department HoD Shekar Naik, and Lakshmi Narayana Shenoy were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/traditional-foods-boost-health/article37695529.ece
26 November 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Tribals forcibly inoculated: NGO||Residents of Madaiahnakatte hamlet in Hunsur taluk have accused the authorities of forcing them to get vaccinated against COVID-19. They complained to a visiting NGO that 30 people were vaccinated without taking them into confidence recently. The NGO —Development through Education (DEED) — said that the people had panicked as almost 20 of the 30 people who were vaccinated, are reporting discomfort and some form of illness. When the DEED visited the hamlet on receiving complaints, locals said they were afflicted by fever. Hence S. Sreekanth of DEED suggested that the authorities conduct a general medical check-up and help infuse confidence in the community. There were also complaints that some local officials had issued oral orders that ration should not be distributed unless people were vaccinated, he added. “Members of the Jenu Kuruba community are generally resistant to allopathic medicines and avoid injection. This being the case, the tribals should have been counselled and taken into confidence and vaccinated only after securing their consent. But the general complaint is that they were forced to take it,” said Mr. Sreekanth. DEED has sent a complaint to the Deputy Commissioner of Mysuru and other officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/tribals-forcibly-inoculated-ngo/article37695271.ece
26 November 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Aerial survey for rail project in Kerala triggers alarm in Karnataka||The aerial survey in neighbouring Kerala for a railway line, connecting Thalassery with Mysuru via Wayanad, has created a flutter in Karnataka which has opposed the project. Forest Department officials in Karnataka have averred that no permission had been issued so far for the survey for the Thalassery-Wayanad-Mysuru rail line which passes through or close to the protected areas in the State. The denial comes in the wake of reports in The Hindu that the Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd. had launched a survey for the proposed linear project by using the heliborne geophysical mapping technique. The 10-day survey is expected to help assess the terrain, including the rock formation, soil, underground water resources etc., along the proposed alignment of the railway route. A senior official said the project had been opposed by Karnataka in the past and its stance had not changed. “As far as aerial survey is concerned it was being conducted in Kerala as per the reports but nobody has approached us so far seeking permission,” said the official. He said there was a general rule that unmanned vehicles or helicopters could not fly over protected zone and reiterated that so far nobody had approached them for permission. Wildlife activists in the State have stated that the aerial survey could not be conducted as flying over Bandipur or Nagarahole with helicopter was not allowed as per the Eco Sensitive Zone notification. A retired Prinicipal Chief Conservator of Forest (Wildlife) said the linear project would affect a very fragile part of Western Ghats. “An attempt was made to have railway line from Nanjangud to Nilambur through Bandipur in the past but it was thwarted by the Forest Department,” the official said. Wildlife activists said a railway line through the area would accentuate human-animal conflict. Incidentally, there is wide-spread opposition to the Mysuru-Madikeri railway route as well, which received administrative clearance and budgetary support a few years ago. But the project is yet to receive environmental clearance. Though the local MP Pratap Simha has stated that the railway line will not be extended beyond Kushalnagar, there is opposition to the project itself on the grounds that it is inimical to the environment and will accentuate human-wildlife conflict.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/aerial-survey-for-rail-project-in-kerala-triggers-alarm-in-karnataka/article37695283.ece
26 November 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Cong. candidate’s nomination papers in order||The Congress has heaved a sigh of relief consequent to the nomination papers of its candidate for the Mysuru-Chamarajanagar Legislative Council polls being found to be in order. The BJP had alleged discrepancy in the nomination papers submitted by the Congress candidate D. Thimmaiah and had asked Deputy Commissioner Bagadi Goutham, who is also the Returning Officer, to reject them. The alleged discrepancy was over contradictory claims made by the candidate in the nomination papers but after hearing both the sides, Mr.Gautham said the papers were in order. A.S.Ponnana, advocate for the Congress candidate, said the BJP had raised three objections all of which have been rejected. Meanwhile, the KPCC spokesperson A. Lakshman has sought the rejection of the nomination papers of R. Raghu, who is the BJP nominee for the elections to the Council. The Congress said that Mr. Raghu is the Chairman of the D.Devaraja Urs Backward Classes Development Corporation and he was nominated by the Government of Karnataka to that post. If he is contesting the elections, he should have resigned from the post which he has not done, according to the Congress which alleged that it was a clear violation of Election Commission’s guidelines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cong-candidates-nomination-papers-in-order/article37695532.ece
26 November 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||VC tells youth to develop resilience to failures||Vice-Chancellor G. Hemantha Kumar on Thursday said severe competition leads to stress which needs to be managed well if one has to become successful in life. Given the challenges, youth must develop resilience to all kinds of failures, challenges and manage the situation positively so as to achieve the desired goals, he suggested. Speaking after inaugurating a workshop on “Youth Empowerment” organised by the Other Backward Classes Cell and the Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC), University of Mysore, here, he said the youth need to adopt to the ever changing demands of life in today’s challenging world. They have to get qualified and then find suitable jobs amidst cut-throat competition. Failure at any juncture or just the fear of failure makes most of our youth crestfallen and depressed. There are many ways to tackle the problem of stress, finding appropriate way of managing it without affecting our health but this is also a challenge. The best approach is to train our minds to handle stressful situation and stay resilient. Arguing that meditation is one way out, the VC said, “I hope that today’s session would be highly beneficial in empowering our youth. I hope that the focus on meditation enlightens the bright minds of our students.” Resilience building becomes essential to move ahead in life with a positive mindset. Resilience is the ability to recognise and acknowledge that a situation has become difficult and choose a response that leads to growth, he advised.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vc-tells-youth-to-develop-resilience-to-failures/article37695533.ece
26 November 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Farmers to stage rasta roko in Karnataka||Farmers under the aegis of Samyukta Kisan Morcha will stage a rasta roko across the State and block traffic on the State and National Highways on Friday. This was stated by Kurubur Shanthakumar of the Federation of Farmers’ Associations here on Thursday. As a result, road transportation may be affected as the morcha members in different parts of the State would take part in the agitation. Blocking of highways The blocking of highways is part of a nation-wide agitation by farmers pressing for immediate enactment of a law to ensure statutory guarantee to the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for agricultural produce. Though the plan is to hold a dawn to dusk agitation, the farmers are still not clear as to how it will pan out across the State. In addition to a law guaranteeing MSP, the farmers in Karnataka also want the land reforms Act and the APMC (amendment) Act to be revoked. Mr.Shanthakumar said these two laws were inimical to farmers and the concept of food security as it would encourage corporatization of agriculture. Farmers with small and medium-sized land holdings would be the worst affected and could end up selling their land and abandoning agriculture, he added. The land reforms Act in the State has eased the purchase of agricultural land and has lifted the restriction on its purchase and use for non-agricultural purpose by any individual. Earlier, only farmers could purchase agricultural land and even the conversion of land for non-agricultural purpose was a tedious process. The opposition to the amendment to the APMC Act stems from the fear that it will ensure the entry of multinational companies and corporates to the agricultural sector and they could dictate the cropping pattern and in the long run, even the pricing pattern, according to Mr. Shanthakumar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/farmers-to-stage-rasta-roko-in-karnataka/article37695431.ece

The students, who daily travel from Doranahalli to Shahapur taluk headquarters, which is eight kilometers away, are finding it difficult as they do not have bus service running on time to reach classes. Therefore, they said, the Shahapur depot of Kalyan Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (KKRTC) should operate buses exclusively from Doranahalli to Shahapur during the morning hours. As the protest was on, State secretary of the BJP’s Raita Morcha Chandrashekhargowda Magnur and the Shahapur Police rushed to the spot and pacified the students.

26 November 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||TUCI alleges conspiracy to delay demolition of Kapico resorts||The Kerala Matsya Thozhilali Aikya Vedi (TUCI) has alleged conspiracy behind the delay in demolishing the illegally constructed villas of Kapico Kerala Resorts Pvt. Ltd on Nediyathuruthu island in Vembanad Lake. In a statement here on Thursday, TUCI State president Charles George said any move to delay the implementation of the Supreme Court order would be opposed. In January 2020, the apex dismissed appeals by Kapico against a Kerala High Court decision banning the construction of resorts and removal of structures on the backwater island. The court observed that the constructions had violated coastal and environmental regulations. Although nearly two years had passed since the court ordered the demolition of the villas, the move to demolish the structures remained in limbo. Govt. criticised Mr. George alleged that the State Government’s move to categorise more coastal panchayats under Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ)- II based on coastal zone management plan was part of attempts to delay the implementation of the Supreme Court order.  Though the responsibility of demolishing the structures was with the Panavally grama panchayat, the local body, following the court verdict, sought the help of the State Government citing its lack of expertise and finance to carry out the task. Earlier this year, a special committee was constituted to carry out an environmental impact assessment study and prepare a plan for the demolition of the structures. After some delay, officials with the Public Works Department and the Pollution Control Board visited the island recently to prepare the plan. Kapico constructed 54 villas and a main block among other facilities over a period of six years from 2007. In March 2013, the High Court ordered the demolition of Kapico along with the illegal structures constructed by Vaamika Island (Green Lagoon Resort) on Vettila Thuruthu, also in Vembanad Lake.

A decision to regulate the water level will be taken by the rule committee, which is monitoring the inflow and rain forecasts, he said adding that the orange alert level was 2,401 ft. It may take a day or two to reach the orange alert level if there was no unprecedented rise in inflow. The water level was 2,400.46 ft at 6 p.m. on Thursday. “At present, there is no chance of it reaching 2,401 ft on Friday. In case of extreme rainfall, a decision on opening the shutters may be taken on Friday,” he said. As per the new rule curve level, the blue alert level is 2,395 ft, orange alert 2,401 ft, and red alert 2,402 ft. The upper rule level is 2,403 ft. The power generation at Moolamattam on Wednesday was 15.405 million units. Only five of the six generators are functional now and it is likely to impact the water level.

26 November 2021||KALPETTA,KERALA||Protest against heli-borne survey for railway project||A group of people under the aegis of the Nilgiri-Wayanad NH and Railway Action Committee and traders’ organisations took out a march on Thursday to the helipad at Sulthan Bathery in protest against the alleged attempt to subvert the Nilambur-Nanjangud railway line project. The base camp for the heli-borne survey for the proposed Thalassery-Wayanad-Mysuru railway line has been set up at Sulthan Bathery. Inaugurating the march, action committee convener T.M. Rasheed said the proposed railway line had found a place in the pink book of the Indian Railways, and the previous UDF Government had allocated Rs. 8 crore to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) for preparing a detailed project report (DPR) and conducting the final location survey for the project after obtaining permissions from the Centre and the Railway Board in 2016. DMRC officials had said that the project would be completed in 2021, and that funds would not be a constraint for it, Mr. Rasheed said. But the LDF Government sabotaged the project by not providing funds to the DMRC claiming that the Karnataka Government had not granted permission for the survey, he alleged. The Karnataka Government had informed Kerala that it would consider the project provided the railway line passed through the tunnel in the forest area and had recommended that the application be submitted in the prescribed format through the agency concerned. However, the Kerala Government is yet to take any positive steps, he said. The Karnataka Government is yet to grant permission for a survey for the proposed Thalassery-Wayanad-Mysuru project, but the Kerala Government had released Rs. 18 crore for the ongoing survey which is restricted to a small region in the State, Mr. Rasheed said. Such a move will be opposed, he warned. The protesters also staged a dharna in front of the base camp of the project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/protest-against-heli-borne-survey-for-railway-project/article37695442.ece

Rajan has said that dashboards will be set up at the district level to inform people of the status of petitions concerning title deeds and the aim is to resolve all grievances expeditiously. The Minister, addressing a meeting of revenue officials at the Kasaragod Collectorate on Thursday, said dashboards should be ready by December. Applications received should be noted on the dashboard, along with steps taken/objections. Mr. Rajan said land issues in Kasaragod were complex, though the number of applications for title deeds was low. It should be clear how many title deeds could be issued in the district in the next five years. Title deeds should not be denied for incorrect information in revenue records and steps should be taken to issue the same to the landless. He suggested that a special drive should be held to resolve issues concerning land conversion, revenue cases, and title deeds. Mr. Rajan said the problem with land reclassification was complex. The number of complaints was also increasing. “It is only when land tax is paid online that many become aware of the nature of the land. Special arrangements will be made to resolve such grievances.” He said a digital resurvey of land would be launched soon.

Undertaken by Cochin Smart City Mission Limited (CSML), which was tasked with creating exemplar areas in Kochi, the work does not affect the heritage value of the area, said Shanavas S. CEO, CSML. Biley Menon, co-convenor of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) described it as a “great opportunity for a classic conservation.” Interestingly, the relaying of the road has unearthed a few items of possible antique value, including pottery, bone, teeth, coins, ceramic shards, roof tiles, and smoking pipes. “The area demands and deserves sensitive infra development, as it has great cultural value. Jew Town in Mattancherry and Fort Kochi are top global destinations,” said Ms. Menon The 120-m heritage lane houses the famous Paradesi Synagogue, built in 1568 by the Sephardic Jews, with a 45-ft clock tower at the far end. These properties, which share a common wall with the Dutch Palace, built in 1545, draw visitors from around the world and generate a substantial amount of revenue from tourism. The main points of contention are the placement of RMU (Ring Main Unit), a sealed type of switchgear used for medium voltage power distribution, on the sidewalks; raised footpaths and the resulting danger of waterlogging. These points were discussed at a recent meeting convened by Mr. Shanavas. The enhancement proposes to place all overhanging cables and electrical wiring in an underground duct constructed in the middle of the lane, a task that is nearing completion. While this is a neat option, it requires the placement of RMUs of distribution boxes on the sides of the lane, which could be visually unappealing and also block private entrances. The issue of flooding caused by raising the skirting has been addressed by building two drains to remove excess water, said Mr. Shanavas. Stakeholders have been asked to come up with a suitable design and plan for the overall aesthetics of the area (lighting, colour coding, and common signage) that will be funded by CSML. The street was last retouched in 1968 when the Synagogue celebrated its 400th year, with former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Granite paving was done around 10 years ago. Fifty years ago, it housed the Cochin Jewish families. Today, shops, cafes, antique warehouses, and a few residences line the lane. “The vision is to restore the street to a 1952 look before the Jews began to emigrate. It was a residential area and had certain characteristics,” said entrepreneur Jose Dominic. Looking at the possible new character of the area, Mr. Dominic said that the stakeholders were in sync over the common aesthetics required — street lights on walls, embedded roller shutters for shops, no placing wares on the streets, and removal of sign boards are being discussed. To pay tribute to the past, Raigon Stanley, a history enthusiast, and Thaha Ibrahim, a resident upholding the legacy of the late Sara Cohen, who popularised Jewish Malayalam songs and handicrafts, are in touch with the Archaeological Department on the artefacts found over the past year, with the roadwork.

Aluva East Inspector A team led by Deputy Superintendent of Police V. Raajeev will investigate the case, which has assumed political connotations with the Congress on the warpath demanding the dismissal and arrest of C.L. Sudheer, the Inspector who was relieved of the charge of the Aluva East police station and transferred to the police headquarters after being named in the suicide note. The victim had accused the officer of having behaved with her and father rudely in the presence of her husband when summoned to the station in connection with the domestic violence complaint registered by her a month ago. Since then, her husband Mohammed Suhail, to whom she was married in April, and his parents Rukhia and Yousuf were arrested under IPC Section 304B (dowry death), 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) and 306 (abetment of suicide) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention). On Thursday, they were produced in the Aluva First Class Judicial Magistrate Court, which remanded them to 14 days’ judicial custody. While the husband and father were sent to the Muvattupuzha special jail, the mother was sent to the District Jail, Kakkanad. Harassment According to the remand report submitted by the police, the victim was mentally and physically harassed by her husband and in-laws.

26 November 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||HC raps authorities as roads fall into disrepair||The Kerala High Court on Thursday criticised the authorities concerned for not carrying out long-lasting repairs of roads in the State. Justice Devan Ramachandran, while dealing with a case relating to repairs of roads in the Kochi Corporation limits, orally observed that if engineers did not know how to repair roads that could withstand the rains, they should be asked to resign and go. There were several engineers waiting to get into service. The court said the authorities could not say that they did not have the technology to repair roads during the monsoon season. In fact, they should find out innovative techniques. If potholes developed on the roads were immediately repaired, the whole road could be protected. A stitch in time saves nine. The court said that in spite of its directive to carry out the repair work properly, ensure that future work was done without delay and fix responsibility on the engineers and officials concerned for bad roads, the roads had again fallen into disrepair. The court said the issue had to be taken seriously. The court and the citizens could not afford to conduct repair of roads again every year or every six months, which had become the norm. ‘A tragedy’ The court noted that after the monsoons, it started receiving complaints about bad roads. This was really a tragedy because the court’s earlier judgment to fix responsibility had been forgotten by the stakeholders. This could not be allowed and steps would have to be taken to make them conscious of their constitutional duties. The court directed the Director of Pachayats and the Director of Urban Affairs to take stock of the bad roads and adopt steps to ensure that they were repaired immediately.

26 November 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Data on biomedical waste generation sought||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has asked the State Pollution Control Board (PCB) to submit district-wise data on biomedical waste generated by Government and private healthcare institutions in the State. The directive was issued by the Southern Bench of the tribunal comprising Justice K. Ramakrishnan and K. Satyagopal, expert member in the case related to non-compliance with Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016. The court said the data was required to ascertain the scientific distribution of waste between Indian Medical Association Goes Ecofriendly (IMAGE) and Kerala Enviro Infrastructure Ltd. (KEIL), which are the service providers for management of biomedical waste in the State. IMAGE had opposed the PCB’s decision to permit KEIL to collect and process biomedical waste within 75 km from its common biomedical waste treatment facility (CBWTF) at Ambalamedu in five districts including Alappuzha, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Pathanamthitta, and Idukki. The board had informed the tribunal that the time-frame of 48 hours could not be met easily if waste generated across the State was processed at the Palakkad facility of IMAGE alone. It had cited the traffic system and urbanisation as impediments to sticking to the deadline. IMAGE had opposed the 75-km criterion, saying that it was not proper to implement it until adequate facilities were established. The Indian Medical Association, Kerala, had also said that both IMAGE and KEIL were allowed to have open competition till adequate treatment facilities were set up covering the entire State. The board said waste collection and processing did not constitute an industry, and that unhealthy competition in the sector might adversely affect waste minimisation. The Central Pollution Control Board has categorised CBWTFs as a non-industrial sector. It had informed the tribunal that one facility (KEIL) was struggling to get waste, whereas the other (IMAGE) was struggling to handle excess quantity of waste. IMAGE had approached the Division Bench of the Kerala High Court after a Single Bench dismissed its writ petition challenging the order issued by the board entrusting KEIL with the management of biomedical waste generated in five districts and the remaining nine under IMAGE.

26 November 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Pitched battle between Congress activists and police||Aluva town turned into a battlefield on Thursday as an attempt by Congress activists to storm the office of the District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) demanding the dismissal and arrest of the Inspector named in the note left behind by the law student, who allegedly ended her life, was stopped by the police. A protest march led by the District Congress Committee (DCC) president Mohammed Shiyas that started from near the Aluva Town Hall at 11 a.m. was stopped a few hundred metres away from the office by the police. Subsequently, the protesting activists staged a sit-in and held a meeting, which was inaugurated by Hibi Eden, MP. Benny Behanan, MP, MLAs Anwar Sadat, Roji M. John, and Eldhose Kunnappilli were also present. But not long after, the protest turned hostile, as stones and even eggs were rifled towards the police who retaliated with lathi-charge, water canons, and tear gas. The protest was eventually called off for the day around 1.30 p.m. after consultations with Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan and KPCC president K. Sudhakaran. Mofia Parveen, 21, a law student was found hanging in her house leaving behind a note that accused her husband and in-laws of domestic violence and Aluva East Police Inspector C.L. Sudheer of rude behaviour. “We will continue with our protests till the officer is dismissed and arrested. The inquiry report against him by the DySP is at variance with the one submitted by the Ernakulam Range DIG,” said Mr. Shiyas. Inquiry report Deputy Inspector General Neeraj Kumar Gupta said he was in the process of submitting the inquiry report on the officer to the State Police Chief. Though he declined to reveal the findings, it is being reported that the officer was guilty of delaying action on the complaint by the victim for almost a month. Later, around 20 students of Al Azhar Law College, Thodupuzha, where the victim studied, were taken into custody by the police for protesting. “Four of us who were initially allowed to meet the District Police Chief were then stopped following which we staged a sit-in and raised slogans without creating any obstruction. But then we were forcibly taken away without any provocation,” said Ajmal Hakeem Pattery, a student. Mr. Sudhakaran said the Congress fight for truth and justice would not wither away in the face of water canons, grenades, and lathi-charge. He accused the Government of honouring the officer by transferring him to the police headquarters. He said the 11,124 cases registered for atrocities against women this year suggested that women were not safe under the LDF Government. Meanwhile, in a show of solidarity, the parents of the deceased girl met Mr. Sadat who continues his sit-in in front of the Aluva East police station, in the early hours of Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pitched-battle-between-congress-activists-and-police/article37695852.ece

Senior citizens, women, and children were part of the symbolic human bund protest that stretched from the tiny island to Queen’s Walkway. The unique protest was held after floodwaters entered their homes during the normal high tide in the last few days. Members of 62 families in the tiny island had marched to the office of the Goshree Island Development Authority (GIDA) in November last year after they faced a similar situation. “Despite repeated pleas, the authorities have not yet realised our long-standing demand for construction of an outer bund to protect us from flooding during high tide. Around Rs. 6 crore was sanctioned in 2014 to set up the outer bund,” said Reji, a resident. The protesting islanders said the protest in front of the GIDA office in 2020 was called off after the District Collector and elected representatives gave them an assurance that the outer bund would be constructed without any delay. No concrete steps have been taken to make it a reality, they alleged.

The three major components of the innovation campus are a research park, space for start-ups, and academic activities. A concept note on the proposed campus has recommended a 5-10 acre area with 1-2 lakh square feet buildings.  Rs. 200 crore Around Rs. 200 crore will be required to set up the campus, which will be run as a special purpose vehicle (SPV). The proposal was placed before Minister for Higher Education R. Bindu during the inauguration of the RUSA Innovation and Startup Ecosystem on Thursday. The note proposes the setting up of the innovation campus at Kinfra park at Kalamassery. Nearly 50% of the project cost has to be borne by the Government, while the rest will have to be raised through loans by the SPV. Operating expenses and debt servicing will be through internal revenue generated from the campus. The research park will be home to companies to set up their own research and development space in association with the varsity. Companies associated with sectors like biotechnology, marine science, chemical engineering, shipping, electronics, and Information Technology will be invited to set up space in the park. The start-up space will accelerate the successful development of entrepreneurial companies in various domains through an array of support resources and services. The start-ups will be permitted to use the varsity facilities for clinical and field trials and technology for prototype development. Faculty members will extend their expertise to the start-ups, while students could be recruited as interns and part-time employees.

Sudheeran complaining that the Government had decided to open more liquor outlets allegedly under the cover of a High Court order to provide better facilities in liquor shops. The court observed that it had not in any manner permitted or restrained the Government from taking a policy decision in this regard. The intention of the court when it had issued the directive to provide walk-in facilities at liquor shops was to ensure that long queues in front of outlets were done away with. Besides, the court wanted to ensure that the minds of the next generation were not polluted by seeing the long queues in front of liquor shops, which was an affront on the collective dignity of citizens, and to see that women and children were not prejudiced solely because a few citizens had exercised their right to buy liquor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-told-to-take-own-decision-on-liquor-policy/article37695511.ece

Justice Devan Ramachandran also directed the Ernakulam District Collector or any other officer chosen by him not below the rank of a Deputy Collector to be in the overall charge of the administration and management of the church until such time as the vicar is able to call for elections to the managing committee as per the 1934 constitution of the Church. Role of vicar The court clarified that the vicar would be the president of the administration, while the Collector or his delegate would be in the overall charge of the church. The court further ordered that the vicar would call for the parishioners’ assembly to update the parish register as per the provisions of the constitution and give an opportunity to every parish member to participate in the sacrament as had been mandated in the constitution so that the elections to the managing committee could be conducted as expeditiously as possible. The properties will remain part of the church itself, and as such the status quo will continue until such time as either of the parties is able to establish to the contrary through a process of law, the court said. The disputes arising with respect to the updating of the register could be brought to the notice of the court. The court also directed the Collector to remove all temporary fencing and such other divisions within the properties of the church. The court passed the order on a writ petition seeking police protection by the vicar for performing rituals at the church.

Terming it morale booster for the Kochi Corporation and other stakeholders who have been striving to improve the living conditions in the city, Mayor M. Anilkumar said Kochi had scored 72.29 points out of 100, in a survey conducted by the Central Government, based on socio-economic and environmental indicators in cities across India. “It is proof that works done in spheres like urban housing, integration of commuting modes, promoting pedestrian corridors and bicycling, poverty and hunger eradication, education, gender sensitivity, and a total of 15 parameters paid dividends,” he added. While lauding the Kochi Corporation for making some breakthrough in containing flooding in the city, former Corporation Town Planning Officer D. Baburajan, who also served as Chief Engineer of Kochi and three other Corporations in the State, said much more had to be done in that direction, since water level has been rising at the rate of over 1 cm every year in the city, during high tides, inundating more areas as years pass by. “Little has been done to contain mosquito menace and air, water and sound pollution, all of which have a direct bearing on the health of Kochiites and visitors to the city,” said Mr. Baburajan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kochi-should-do-much-more-for-sustainable-development/article37695844.ece
26 November 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||CBSE schools plan drive against dowry||CBSE schools across the State are set to kick-start a week-long campaign against dowry coinciding with Dowry Prohibition Day to be observed on Friday. The campaign is to be held under the aegis of the Council of CBSE Schools Kerala (CCSK), an affiliate of the apex body of the National Council of CBSE Schools. CCSK has issued a circular to managers and principals of 250-odd schools under its jurisdiction to organise an oath-taking ceremony against dowry by students during the assembly on Friday. The oath is against demanding and receiving dowry while committing students to do the fight against it. Schools have also been asked to record videos of the oath-taking and send them to CCSK for making a collage of videos delivering the message against the social evil. Week-long drive “We will not stop with taking the oath but are set to organise a week-long campaign against dowry using children in compliance with the COVID-19 protocol. Groups of 10 students will be formed as ambassadors of change, and each student will take the awareness message against dowry to four households in her neighbourhood. Detailed reports will be collected from each group, the summary of which will be given to the State and Central educational ministers and the curriculum committee,” said Indira Rajan, secretary general of the National Council of CBSE Schools. The idea is to make children change-makers to educate elders and thus put an end to dowry in the long run. Students will be given detailed guidelines about the messaging to be done during their household interactions. Meanwhile, for Ms. Rajan, the observation of Dowry Prohibition Day is even more fulfilling as it is the fallout of her Public Interest Litigation (PIL) urging proactive steps on the part of the Government against dowry. She filed the PIL in June in the wake of Uthra murder and the death of Vismaya.  “Skimming the surface will not help address the issue. It should be made part of the curriculum so that the upcoming generation becomes aware of the social evil of dowry and fight it,” Ms. Rajan said.  The idea is to make children change-makers to educate elders and thus put an end to dowry in the long run.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cbse-schools-to-kick-start-campaign-against-dowry/article37695449.ece

Justice Devan Ramachandran passed the order on a petition filed by Mannam Sugar Mills Cooperative Limited, Pandalam, seeking a directive to dismantle flagpoles erected by various trade unions in front of its gates.

26 November 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Women’s commission to revive ward-level vigilance panels||Aimed at curbing the increasing incidents of violence against women, the Kerala Women’s Commission has decided to reactivate the functioning of its vigilance committees in various local bodies in the State. Inactive committees with ineligible members will be dissolved soon as part of the reconstitution process, aimed at tracking the maximum number of grievances at the beginning itself and reporting it to higher authorities concerned for speedy intervention. On Thursday, nearly 150 vigilance committee members representing the 75 divisions of the Kozhikode Corporation turned up for their first round of training as part of resuming the ward-level surveillance activities. It was part of the State-level events hosted by the women’s commission in the city to mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and explain the action plan for the days to come. Officials who coordinated the training programme said the vigilance committee members would be able to perform better and make the desirable changes on completion of their multiple rounds of orientation, in association with various local bodies and the Kudumbashree Mission. The focus would be on identifying unreported incidents of domestic violence, sexual abuse, and dowry-related assaults, they said. The revival process was taken up after the women’s commission noticed the lackadaisical approach of some ward-level committees, which failed to report even grievous incidents to higher authorities. Various expert panels had also suggested that the active contribution of ward-level committees would be crucial in making timely interventions. “Instructions have also been given to the district-level vigilance committees to ensure the proper functioning of ward-level committees in the information gathering and mitigation process. The police and law experts will support the process,” said an official with the women’s commission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/womens-commission-to-revive-ward-level-vigilance-panels/article37695453.ece
26 November 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Self-financing college staff seek to amend varsity rules||A Left-leaning organisation representing the staff and teachers of self-financing colleges has petitioned all the universities in the State to implement the Kerala Self-Financing College Teaching and Non-Teaching Employees (Appointment and Conditions of Service) Bill 2021, which got the Governor’s assent recently. K.P. Abdul Azeez, joint secretary, Self-Financing College Teachers and Staff Association, said on Thursday that the statutes of universities should be immediately amended. He said the rules related to universities were promulgated much before most of the self-financing colleges were introduced in the State. Because of this, the staff and teachers in these colleges have had no representation in the Syndicate, Senate, Board of Studies, and academic council of the universities. The appointment of teachers and staff in those colleges was left to the whims and fancies of the managements, alleged Mr. Azeez. Association members pointed out that the law would regulate the appointments and conditions of service, including salary, of the teaching and non-teaching staff. It would help standardise their posts, pay scales, increment, grade promotion, over-time allowance, provident fund, and insurance. They would now be governed by the norms of the All India Council for Technical Education, University Grants Commission, and National Council for Teacher Education. Working days and working hours have been made similar to that of aided and government colleges. Internal quality assurance cell, parent-teacher association, college council, and students’ grievance redressal cell should be set up in colleges. The legislation was brought in based on the recommendations of the Kerala State Higher Education Council. ‘Plan to move court’ Mr. Azeez said some of the private college managements were reportedly planning to approach the Supreme Court against the Act. It was unfortunate that they were opposing a move that would ensure the quality of higher education in the State, he added. Functionaries of the association recently met Calicut University Vice Chancellor M.K. Jayaraj to put forward the demand. Around 50,000 staff in self-financing colleges affiliated to the University of Calicut would get benefited, they said. They are meeting at Thrissur on Friday to discuss the future course of action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/self-financing-college-staff-seek-to-amend-varsity-rules/article37695451.ece
26 November 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Inadequate fuel supply leaves LPG auto drivers a worried lot||Leaders of a district-level committee of LPG autorickshaw drivers have accused LPG filling station managements in Kozhikode of negligence, as they have failed to ensure essential stock. Though there are over 1,500 LPG-powered autorickshaws, there are only five fuel stations in the district, and many go dry during peak hours of service, they add. “It takes several days or weeks to recharge a dried-up station, as nobody is interested in catering for LPG-powered vehicles in time. Placing purchase orders in advance is not done by fuel station managements,” says A.K. Sajeevkumar, president, LPG autorickshaw drivers’ committee. LPG autorickshaw drivers say they are frequently denied service in the name of limited stock or unexpected mechanical complaints at the dispensing units. The laxity in appointing a local team to handle unexpected mechanical errors continues to be a big concern, they allege. “Now, almost all dispensing stations in the district depend on the service support of technicians from outside the State. It takes several days or weeks to address an issue. They can easily find a local solution to this,” says Mr. Sajeevkumar. According to him, there should be a proportionate increase in the number of LPG filling stations to find a lasting solution to autorickshaw drivers’ struggles. The drivers’ committee also points out that three out of the five LPG filling stations are located within the Corporation limits, which fail to cater for many rural operators. The two stations opened at Mukkom and Payyoli with an aim to serve rural operators are yet to meet the actual service demand. With the poor number of easily accessible LPG stations, many rural operators are disinclined to exchange their old petrol and diesel vehicles with LPG variants.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/inadequate-fuel-supply-leaves-lpg-auto-drivers-a-worried-lot/article37695455.ece

SFI activists Amaldev, Bindev, and Sreelesh were injured in the incident. They had gone to Pareeksha Bhavan to enquire about the studies of another student in the university teaching department. They claimed that since they did not know which section was handling the issue, they sought the help of a university staff. In between, another staff asked them why they were standing there. When the students questioned his approach, they were reportedly beaten up. The students claimed that he was joined later by over a dozen other staff. It was alleged that the shutters of the building were downed to stop them from going out. The SFI activists took out a protest march later. However, Calicut University Employees’ Centre, a pro-RSS organisation representing university employees, alleged that the SFI activists had beaten up one of their members. The employees claimed that they had only questioned the presence of students on the campus where the COVID-19 protocol was in force. They sought action against the students who were behind the incident. A protest too was held. Earlier, SFI activists blocked an ambulance which arrived to take a staffer who claimed to have sustained injuries to hospital. He was later taken in a police vehicle.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/scuffle-between-staff-and-sfi-activists-at-calicut-university/article37695452.ece

Thiruvananthapuram ranked third alongside Chandigarh with a score of 72.36 while Kochi ranked fifth with 72.29 points. Shimla (75.50 points) topped the rankings followed by Coimbatore (73.29). The index and dashboard, which ranked 56 urban areas on 77 SDG indicators, are a result of the NITI Aayog-GIZ and BMZ collaboration focused on driving SDG localisation in Indian cities under the umbrella of the Indo-German Development Cooperation. Parameters They assessed indicators, including poverty reduction, health, education, women empowerment, water and sanitation, clean energy, economic growth, industry, urban development, climate action and governance. Both Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi were adjudged achievers (100 points) in ‘climate action.’ Thiruvananthapuram stood first in quality education, second in gender equality, and shared the third spot in peace, justice and strong institutions. Weak areas Thiruvananthapuram’s lowest score was in decent work and economic growth, scoring 38 points (Aspirant), which still was higher than that of many cities. Kochi stood first in gender equality and second in quality education; clean water and sanitation; and peace, justice and strong institutions. Kochi had its lowest scores (Aspirant) in industry, innovation and infrastructure (19); decent work and economic growth (39) and sustainable production and consumption patterns (48).

Matter of pride: CM That the achievements came in spite of the hardships caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was a matter of pride, Mr. Vijayan said. Of the 56 urban units assessed, 44 have populations of above 10 lakh. The remaining 12 are capital cities with populations of below 10 lakh. According to the NITI Aayog, the index and dashboard “will further strengthen SDG localisation and institute robust SDG monitoring at the city level. It highlights the strengths and gaps of ULB-level data, monitoring, and reporting systems.” Such tools contribute to the creation of an ecosystem where all stakeholders were equipped to adopt and implement data-driven decision making, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kochi-fifth-in-sdg-index/article37695837.ece

26 November 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Protests against police ‘apathy’ gain momentum in State||Protests against the “police apathy” to victims of crime, particularly women and children, seemed to escalate in the State on Thursday. Congress activists clashed with the police in Aluva, accusing the Circle Inspector of prompting the suicide of a dowry harassment victim by beating her in front of her in-laws in the local station house. Mofiya Parveen, a law student, was found dead in her house the next day. Her “suicide note” that damned the officer’s response to her grievance arguably belied the pro-victim policing image actively promoted by the Left Democratic Front (LDF) Government. It also did not help the Government that the officer had received a law and order posting despite drawing adverse remarks from superiors for “botching” the infamous Uthara dowry-related murder. Indefinite stir Congress leaders, led by Benny Behanan, MP, are on an indefinite sit-in in front of the Aluva police station. Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president K. Sudhakaran and Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan demanded the officer’s prosecution. They also condemned the use of tear gas and water cannon against Congress workers. The BJP also entered the fray with party State president K. Surendran visiting Mofiya’s house in Kochi and demanded justice for the law student. He said the Government had conveniently transferred the officer to the police headquarters instead of prosecuting him. Mr. Vijayan lorded over law enforcement populated by criminals. By a conservative estimate, at least 744 serving officers faced criminal charges. Mr. Surendran said the BJP would unleash street protests for gender justice. The Government also faced BJP protests for allegedly “aiding Popular Front of India assailants responsible” for the murder of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh activist Sanjith in Palakkad. Mr. Surendran said the latest move to withdraw the case against CPI(M) goons accountable for the attack on the BJP State headquarters was another example of the police-party nexus. The BJP also held protest marches to various Collectorates to highlight the CPI(M)-jihadist nexus in the wake of the murder of Sanjith. Adoption row The Congress and the BJP held separate protests demanding the ouster of Child Welfare Committee general secretary J.S. Shiju Khan for allegedly putting up a child for adoption without the mother’s consent. Late on Thursday, Congress workers organised a “night march” to highlight the “atrocities” against women and the “misogynist” attitude of the police and Government.

Observing that the Poojappura jail currently accommodated 1,350 inmates, far beyond its capacity of 727 people, commission chairman Antony Dominic directed the Director General of Prisons and Correctional Services to submit a response before December 23. The case will be taken up for further hearing on December 29. The order has also been sent to the Additional Chief Secretary (Home). Work on prisons on Based on a petition by social activist P.K. Raju, the commission had earlier sought information from the Director General of Prisons and Correctional Services. In his response, the officer informed the commission that prisoners were often transferred to the Poojappura Central Prison from other jails in south Kerala. As part of decongesting the jail, the development of the district prisons in Pathanamthitta and Alappuzha was under way. The number of inmates at Poojappura was likely to come down with the completion of the work on the Konni and Nedumangad prisons. The proposed facility at Konni was being developed as a central prison, the report stated. Health issues Noting that the explanation made no mention of a deadline for the completion of the work at Konni and Nedumangad, Mr. Dominic said cramming inmates at the Poojappura jail was bound to affect their mental and physical health.

26 November 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Adoption row shows no sign of abatement||The adoption row showed scarce signs of abating on Thursday. Anupama S. Chandran whose child was given for adoption allegedly without her knowledge has vowed to continue her struggle to unseat those at the helm of the Kerala State Council for Child Welfare (KSCCW) and Child Welfare Committee (CWC). She sought the prosecution of KSCCW general secretary J.S. Shiju Khan on the charge of violating the provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act. She also wanted the CWC disbanded. The Opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have thrown their weight behind Anupama. Notably, Revolutionary Marxist Party (RMP) legislator K.K. Rema and social activist P.E. Usha were with Anupama through every step of her protest. The State Government had ordered the Women and Child Development Director to inquire into the incident and fix accountability on those responsible for the wrongful adoption. Speculation was rife that the inquiring officer had filed a report “damning the dubious role” of the KSCCW and CWC. However, the Government has not revealed the findings. Health Minister Veena George maintained that the Government was yet to vet the findings. CPI(M) denies charges Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] Thiruvananthapuram district secretary Anavoor Nagappan denied that he had shielded Mr. Khan. He also denied media reports that the inquiry officer had found fault with the KSCCW general secretary for the episode. The KSCCW had no role in the adoption process and its only mandate was to protect and ensure the welfare of children. Moreover, the missing child complaint had reached the council belatedly. The CPI(M) State committee had stated that the Government should restore the child to its biological mother. The party had not taken a moralistic or patriarchal attitude towards children born out of wedlock. Anupama had earlier singled out Mr. Nagappan for abetting her parent’s desire to “disappear the child to save family honour.” Court order Meanwhile, a district court ruled that P.S. Jayachandran, a local CPI(M) leader and Anupama’s father, could seek bail in the adoption case from a lower court. Congress workers highlighted the adoption faux pas as symbolic of the Government’s medieval attitude towards women and children at their “with women” night march in the capital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/adoption-row-shows-no-signs-of-abating/article37695496.ece

Mani, Kerala Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (Milma) chairman, said here on Thursday. Milma does not have any price revision proposal before it at the moment. Moreover, the State Government had declared that a hike was not on the cards, Mr. Mani said. Milk prices were last hiked by Rs. 4 per litre in September 2019. The milk cooperative has recorded an increase in both milk procurement and sales in the State over the past year. But there is still potential to increase both. The average daily procurement by Milma currently stands at 15.5 lakh litres and sales, 14.25 lakh litres (till October this year). This was 13.51 lakh litres and 13.1 lakh litres respectively in 2020-21, Mr. Mani said. Cutting costs Milma was currently focussing on helping dairy farmers cut production costs. For helping farmers overcome COVID-19-induced economic hardships, cattle feed was supplied at subsidised rates, he said.

26 November 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Court allows minor to end 25-week pregnancy||The High Court of Karnataka has permitted a 16-year-old rape survivor to terminate her 25-week pregnancy after the medical board found that continuation of pregnancy may impact the minor’s mental and physical health besides impacting her status in society. Justice N.S. Sanjay Gowda passed the order while allowing the petition filed by the minor through her mother. The petitioners had approached the court after the medical practitioner and the Belagavi district hospital refused to terminate the pregnancy citing provisions of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971. “The minor needs termination as continuing pregnancy endangers the mother physically and mentally with risk as explained by the gynaecologist and psychiatrist,” said the report of the medical board, set up by Belagavi district surgeon on directions of the High Court. The court noted that the paediatrician, who was part of the medical board, opined that it would be a high-risk pregnancy as the survivor is a teenage mother and it would also pose grave risk to the foetus. Mental state factored in The court took into consideration the view of the psychiatrist, who pointed out that if the pregnancy was continued, the petitioner would develop anxiety and could lead to definite depression. Citing the apex court’s decisions equating women’s right to reproduction with the right to personal liberty guaranteed under Constitution of India, the court observed that “The consequences of continuing the pregnancy on the future life of the 16-year-old would be quite severe and detrimental to a dignified life as contemplated under Article 21 of the Constitution.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/court-permits-16-year-old-to-terminate-25-week-pregnancy/article37695181.ece

26 November 2021||CHENNAI/TIRUNELVELI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Heavy rain over T.N. till month-end||The India Meteorological Department announced on Thursday that the cyclonic circulation over the south-west Bay of Bengal off the south Sri Lanka coast may not intensify into a low-pressure area. However, it would continue to bring rain of very heavy intensity over south Tamil Nadu and gradually cover north coastal and adjoining districts till November 29. On Thursday, the IMD issued the red alert for Thoothukudi, Tirunelveli, Ramanathapuram, Pudukottai and Nagapattinam as these districts were expected to receive isolated extremely heavy rain. Torrential rain pounded Thoothukudi and Tirunelveli districts, inundating several areas and affecting life. Thoothukudi recorded an extremely intense rain of 26 cm between 8.30 a.m. and 5.30 p.m. on Thursday. Thiruchendur in Thoothukudi district received nearly 18 cm; the Thoothukudi port, 15 cm; and Palayamkottai in Tirunelveli district, 10 cm. On Friday, Kanniyakumari, Tirunelveli and Thenkasi may record heavy to very heavy rain at one or two places. While most other places are likely to get moderate rain, 10 districts, including Chennai, Madurai, Pudukottai, and Puducherry, may have to be prepared for heavy rain at isolated places. Weekend rain The rainfall may turn more intense in Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts on Saturday and Sunday. Heavy rain is likely to lash more than 15 districts, including the Cauvery delta districts, Chengalpattu, the Nilgiris, Salem, Erode and Puducherry, on Saturday. Chennai may experience heavy rain in some areas till the weekend. Officials said the cyclonic circulation at the lower tropospheric levels and the strong north-easterly winds prevailing over the Tamil Nadu coast at the lower level would push moisture and rain clouds towards the State. S. Balachandran, Deputy Director-General of Meteorology, Chennai, said conditions were not favourable for the circulation over the Bay to consolidate and intensify further. The broad low would still influence the spell of heavy rain. The forecast largely remained the same and the rainfall pattern might vary at some places. A trough line from the weather system along the coast extending up to the northern districts would also sustain the wet spell over Tamil Nadu till November-end. Sometimes, weather systems in initial stages as these would bring heavy rain, he said. Asked why cyclonic circulation did not gain strength, officials said the pressure gradient force between the centre of the circulation and the surrounding areas was less and this decreased the wind speed. Moreover, the Sri Lanka land mass prevented wind speed from increasing further. Another low pressure Another low-pressure area is brewing. It is likely to form over the south Andaman sea around November 29. This may become more marked in the next two days. But it has to be monitored for its impact on Tamil Nadu, officials said. The weather systems this season has yielded excess rain in Tamil Nadu, which recorded 54.1 cm until Thursday, 61% more than the its average of 34 cm.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cyclonic-circulation-to-trigger-heavy-rain-in-tn/article37695280.ece

The results of tests on the remaining 100 students will come on Friday,” he said. Mr. Patil clarified that all those who tested positive were hostellers and chances of the infection spreading out was low. “As a precaution, the administration has sealedofftwo students’ hostels and all students have been asked to self-quarantine for a week. The campus has been cordoned off by the police,” he added. Emphasising the need for exercising restraint and caution, particularly with regard to social gatherings, he asked people to avoid public gatherings and compulsorily follow COVID-19 protocol. Stating that it was too early to conclude if this cluster indicated the beginning of a fresh surge in the State, Mr. Randeep said: “We have seen such clusters being reported from educational institutions in other districts, including in Bengaluru, in the last two months. The Deputy Commissioner has visited the college and containment measures have been initiated.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/66-students-of-medical-college-in-dharwad-test-covid-positive/article37695180.ece
26 November 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Second phase of our fight will be much longer, says Tikait||Leader of Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a federation of farmers and other organisations that have been running an agitation against three farm laws for a year, Rakesh Tikait has stated that it is the responsibility of every government in the country to come to the rescue of families of farmers who lost their lives during the on-going protest movement. Speaking at a protest organised in Hyderabad on Thursday on the occasion of completion of one year of the farmers’ movement, Mr. Tikait said the position of some of the 750-odd farmer families whose members participated in the movement was very bad and they needed a helping hand. They were the farmers of the country and should not be identified with any region or State as they had been fighting for a common cause. Stating that there was no leader for the movement, Mr. Tikait said every farmer and farmworker in the country was its leader although 40 among them had taken the lead in making and managing arrangements for the long-drawn battle. “If succeeded, the entire farming community of the country will benefit and the honours will go to 750-odd families whose members (farmers) have laid down their lives in the agitation”, the SKM leader said. He said the fight of the SKM was not over yet and even the first phase of it would be concluded only when the three farm laws were withdrawn formally with the help of a legislation in Parliament. However, the next phase would be much longer as they wanted the Union Government to recognise the SKM as a group to hold discussions from time to time on all issues related to the farming community and the farm sector. Mr. Tikait said their fight now was much beyond the three farm laws but was also against about 27-28 laws that were against the interests of the farming community, peasants and other workers. The laws/bills that were against the farmers and other such communities included electricity, seed and pesticide bills and several other existing pieces of legislation and there was need for a law on minimum support price (MSP). ‘Unbridled bull’ Referring to Hyderabad and Telangana, apparently a political party, Mr. Tikait said: “There’s an unbridled bull here which says something and means something else. It’s helping BJP indirectly by spreading itself outside the State. It’s the team B of BJP”. He requested the people of Telangana to confine “that bull” to the State in the larger interests of the country. Mr. Tikait likened the farmers who lost their lives during the movement to soldiers laying down their lives in the frontiers of the country. He demanded implementation of the Swaminathan Commission formula to make agriculture remunerative.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/second-phase-of-our-fight-will-be-much-longer-says-tikait/article37695178.ece

26 November 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||HC rejects bail plea of honour killing accused||Justice Lalitha Kanneganti of Telangana High Court on Thursday dismissed the petition of two accused seeking bail in the sensational honour killing of a youngster Hemanth Kumar reported nearly 14 months ago. Yellu Santosh Reddy, 32, businessman and Kaila Sandeep Reddy, 30, private employee, who were the 13th and the 14th accused respectively in the abduction and murder of Hemanth Kumar filed the petition seeking bail. The petitioners’ counsel contended that the accused were family members of the complainant Avanthi Reddy, wife of slain Hemanth Kumar. The lawyer told the court that the petitioners went to the house of Avanthi Reddy to settle the matter as she married outside her caste. The public prosecutor, opposing granting of bail to the accused, said the government had constituted a fast-track court to conduct trial of the court which was likely to commence soon. The counsel appearing for Avanthi Reddy said the accused had forcibly entered their house, kidnapped her husband Hemanth Kumar and killed him. They even threatened Kumar’s mother, after murdering him, the lawyer said. Observing that releasing the accused on bail might result in influencing the witnesses, the judge dismissed the petition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hc-rejects-bail-plea-of-honour-killing-accused/article37695587.ece

26 November 2021||KURNOOL,ANDHRA PRADESH||Paddy lorries halted at border||Telangana officials on Thursday stopped 12 lorries laden with paddy at the Panchalingala checkpost on NH-44. The lorries were going from Nandyal in Kurnool district to Telangana and officials suspected that the paddy was being smuggled into the State to be sold as a locally grown variety during the State government procurement process. The lorry drivers alleged that they were being harassed for no reason despite furnishing all the required documents. When contacted, Kurnool District Supplies Officer Mohan Babu told The Hindu that if those transporting the paddy had all the papers and had paid the GST and if the paddy was meant for business purposes, it should be allowed. In many cases, the locals there surreptitiously get paddy from A.P. for handing over the product as a locally-grown variety, he explained. “We too stop such cross-border transport of paddy coming with proper sale papers, as it leads to the local produce getting blocked,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/paddy-lorries-halted-at-border/article37695574.ece
26 November 2021||KURNOOL,ANDHRA PRADESH||Sarpanches demand release of 15th Finance Commission funds||The Kurnool District Sarpanches Association held a massive dharna in front of the Collector’s office here on Thursday seeking immediate release of the 15th Finance Commission Funds, which were released by the Central Government into the accounts of sarpanches. Development works have come to a standstill and even ensuring daily sanitation, water supply, and maintenance of street lights has become a challenge for the panchayats in Kurnool and Anantapur district, the sarpanches said. Backed by the Andhra Pradesh Panchayati Raj Chamber, the sarpanches said that while they were voted to power 10 months ago, the State government did not allow them to function as expected as all the funds released by the Centre were ‘diverted for unknown reasons’. “While the 14th Finance Commission funds were adjusted against pending power bills, the 15th Finance Commission funds have been siphoned off from the sarpanches’ accounts,” alleged Chamber State general secretary Birru Pratap Reddy. Addressing a protest rally, Mr. Pratap Reddy alleged that the Central Government had allocated Rs. 1,000 crore for panchayats all over the State, which have been diverted. The State government had recently taken those funds unconstitutionally without taking the signatures of the Gram Sarpanches and against the resolution of the Gram Panchayats, he alleged. “If the funds are not transferred immediately, the Andhra Pradesh Panchayati Raj Chamber will hold massive protests in every district centre,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sarpanches-demand-release-of-15th-finance-commission-funds/article37695576.ece

A group of women at Revuru village were in tears, pleading with the Ministers for reconstruction of their damaged houses. Giving a patient hearing to the women, the Ministers, who were accompanied by Collector K.V.N. Chakradhar Babu, asked the district officials to start the process of reconstructing the damaged houses from Friday. The Ministers promised distribution of essential commodities to all the affected people. The villagers complained to the Ministers that they were put to untold hardship in the wake of the sudden release of water from the Somasila reservoir. Most of them have lost all of their belongings and were left in the lurch with no food or water since Sunday, they rued. The Ministers visited the damaged Someswara temple and promised to rebuild it. It is estimated that an amount of Rs. 6 crore would be required for its reconstruction. They also visited the submerged farms and the Somasila reservoir which witnessed an all-time record inflow of 5.50 lakh cusecs of water on Sunday. With the irrigation officials discharging the entire quantity of water, people in the riverine mandals of Nellore, Anatasagaram, Kaluvaya, Chejerla, Atmakur, Sangam, Podalakur, Buchireddipalem, Kovur, Vidavaluru and Indukurpetaand were marooned. Mr. Goutham Reddy allayed the fears of the people over the safety of the Somasila reservoir. Meanwhile, inflows into the reservoir further dipped to 73,885 cusecs. Maintaining a flood cushion of 7.45 tmcft, irrigation officials released over 1.10 lakh cusecs of water downstream on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/marooned-people-pour-out-woes-to-ministers/article37695579.ece
26 November 2021||NEW DELHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Telangana CM not snubbed, he never sought meeting with PM’||Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s return to Hyderabad on Wednesday evening after a four-day stay in Delhi without meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi was not a snub, according to sources in the Union Government. They said it was entirely because no appointment had been sought by Mr. Rao from the Prime Minister’s Office. Mr. Rao arrived in Delhi over the weekend determined, sources said, to discuss issues including procurement of State paddy by the Centre and the sharing of Krishna water with Andhra Pradesh. But he returned without meeting either Mr. Modi or Home Minister Amit Shah. “The last time the Chief Minister of Telangana requested an appointment with the Prime Minister was on September 1 which was granted on September 3,” said the sources. The clarification came amid reports that it was a snub, whereas the Government had no such intention. BJP sources told The Hindu that Mr. Rao raised all sorts of issues over paddy procurement to appear antagonistic to the BJP which was posing a political challenge to the Telangana Rashtra Samithi, especially after the Huzurabad bypoll. “The fact that he didn’t even put in a request for an appointment shows it’s just political posturing,” said a senior BJP leader from Telangana.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/telangana-cm-not-snubbed-he-never-sought-meeting-with-pm/article37695189.ece
26 November 2021||ON BOARD NAVAL HELICOPTER,ANDHRA PRADESH||Hoping for help from the sky||The rumbling noise of the chopper jolted the residents of Moolapalle from their half-sleep and half-fatigue, who ran out of their houses with the hope of getting some essential commodities. Their eyes were stuck in the air, expecting bags of goodies to be dumped on the lone dry patch of land seen in the midst of their submerged fields. The little-known Moolapalle, tucked somewhere abutting a hillock and the Seshachalam forest ranges, is not the only village yearning for help from the sky. Several villages like Kalepalli, Kuppam Badur and Chittathuru upstream of Rayalacheruvu are still in knee-deep water. Moolapalle and Nadimpalle are cut off from the mainland and have remained islands for days together. Till the time the road connectivity is restored, the government authorities are air-dropping essential commodities to such water-logged villages through helicopters drawn from the Indian Navy. The helicopter crew from Bengaluru is slogging it for almost a week by making three sorties a day from the old Tirupati airport to supply commodities to the hinterland. The political leadership is adopting a two-pronged strategy to tackle the flood situation. “On the one hand, we are restoring the canals and water bodies, and on the other, providing food materials to the victims”, says Government Whip Chevireddy Bhaskar Reddy, under whose Chandragiri constituency falls the 500-year-old earthen structure Rayalacheruvu. The water body was filled up to 1.5 times its capacity of 0.6 tmcft, thus posing grave threat to the villages downstream, leaving the authorities with no option but to release huge amounts to strike a balance with the inflows. The villages submerged by its backwaters are still grappling for relief. The bag of essentials containing a rice bag, palm oil, pulse and onions are readied based on the population of the affected village. “We are fully geared to air-drop commodities sufficient for the families in the vicinity, before road restoration begins,” says Deputy Collector Kiran Kumar, who is monitoring the civil supplies to the villages. Rayalacheruvu at its brim, Swarnamukhi river in spate and Malvanigundam waterfalls washing away several colonies of Tirupati are the problems faced by the district administration today.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hoping-for-help-from-the-sky/article37695604.ece

Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Mr. Reddy said that the TTD had reached an agreement with AIR for daily broadcast of pre-dawn rituals like Suprabhatam, Thomala and Archana in 2018. Though the agreement stands valid till August 31, 2022, the TTD withdrew from it and urged the latter to discontinue the services from September. He also demanded to make public the compulsions behind the discontinuation of the broadcast. When contacted by The Hindu , Public Relations Officer T. Ravi attributed the reasons to the TTD developing its own SVBC radio and SVFM channels and said that the decision also led to the saving of around Rs. 35 lakh annually in the form of broadcasting expenses which hitherto were paid to AIR. This apart, he said that the SVBC also telecasts live all the pre-dawn rituals every day for the benefit of the pilgrims fraternity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bjp-demands-revival-of-contract-with-air/article37695580.ece

26 November 2021||Tirupati,ANDHRA PRADESH||Naidu seeks judicial probe into flood fury||Asserting that the disaster caused by the flood in the Rayalaseema districts was a man-made one, TDP national president and former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu on Thursday demanded that a judicial probe be done into the entire episode to fix accountability. “The loss of nearly 60 lives in rain-related incidents is the result of apathy, selfishness and arrogance of the government,” he told the media, while winding up his tour of the flood-hit areas in Chittoor and Kadapa districts. Referring to the flood triggered by the breaches developed in the Pincha and Annamayya projects, Mr. Naidu blamed the YSRCP leaders, alleging that the ruling party was hand-in-glove with the sand mafia. “Water was not released from these projects in time to safeguard the interests of the sand mafia and this led to the disaster, “ he said, adding that the Irrigation Department failed in maintenance of its assets such as reservoirs and projects. “There is a disaster manual on preventive measures during flood situation such as alerting the public in time, shifting people to relief camps, providing immediate rehabilitation and estimating the quantum of compensation. Notwithstanding the heavy rains, the YSRCP government failed on all fronts,” said Mr. Naidu. Blaming the government for the loss of life and property, he said many villages were washed away and innocent lives were lost for no reason. The TDP president recollected how his government had acted during the Hudhud and Titli cyclones and checked the number of deaths to less than 20. Mr. Naidu said that he would write to the Chief Secretary soon on this issue. Former Mministers N. Amarnatha Reddy, N. Kishore Kumar Reddy, former TUDA chairman G. Narasimha Yadav, Chittoor parliamentary in-charge Pulivarthi Nani accompanied Mr. Naidu during his visit. Special Correspondent in NELLORE adds: Mr. Naidu accused the Chief Minister of shirking his responsibility when it came to extending aid to the flood victims. Touring some of flood-hit areas in Naidupet, Gudur and Indukurpet mandals, he said the Chief Minister washed his hands off relief measures by making an aerial survey. Opining that excessive sand mining downstream of Somasila reservoir was responsible for the flood fury, he said the TDP would fight for enhanced input subsidy for farmers who had lost their crops. He alleged that the YSRCP, which came to power promising prohibition, was boosting its revenue through liquor sale .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-seeks-judicial-probe-into-flood-fury/article37695607.ece

He alleged that the statement of accounts sent by the State to the Centre seeking interim relief was nowhere near the ground situation. “When the loss has been estimated at Rs. 6,064 crore, how can the government wash off its hands by paying Rs. 2 crore to the Collector?” he asked, adding that there was no clarity on the losses in the farm sector.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jsp-wants-cbi-inquiry/article37695602.ece

26 November 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||Every PHC in State will get two ‘family doctors’, says Jagan||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has said the government was implementing the family doctor concept by appointing two doctors in each Primary Health Centre (PHC), who would be visiting villages and offering medical services through the 104 service vehicles. In the last 29 months, a sum of nearly Rs. 4,000 crore was spent on the Aarogyasri scheme and 2,466 procedures were brought under its purview. Another significant thing which the government did was to widen its scope by increasing the annual income limit to Rs. 5 lakh, which resulted in the coverage of 95% of the population, the Chief Minister said during a discussion on the health sector in the Legislative Assembly on Thursday. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said that super specialty services were being offered under the Aarogyasri scheme in over 130 empanelled hospitals in cities such as Hyderabad, Chennai and Bengaluru. The YSRCP government has cleared the unpaid bills amounting to Rs. 680 crore to the network hospitals, which were kept by the previous dispensation. Health infra Besides, costly surgeries such as bone-marrow and heart transplantation and cochlear implants were included in the scheme to help the poor. “Sixteen new teaching hospitals are being set up in the State, besides revamping the existing 11 medical colleges. The goal is to have one teaching hospital, one nursing college and a 500-bed super-specialty hospital in every parliamentary constituency,” said Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy. Steps were taken to strengthen the health sector from village level by establishing 10,032 YSR village clinics, 560 urban health clinics, 1,321 PHCs, 52 area hospitals and 191 community health centres at a total cost of Rs. 16,255 crore. The Chief Minister further said for the first time, the government has introduced the YSR Aarogya Asara scheme, as part of which Rs. 5,000 is paid to patients during their recovery from surgeries, and providing monthly pensions ranging from Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 10,000 to people suffering from chronic ailments. As part of its special focus on the health of children, the government has planned to set up three exclusive hospitals for children to provide advanced treatments, in addition to the existing one in Tirupati. COVID-19 management The Chief Minister said that the State had effectively tackled the pandemic. A total of 3.02 crore people have undergone testing. “As far as the vaccination drive is concerned, 100 % of those aged above 18 years would be covered by March 2022. So far, 3.4 crore people have been administered at least one dose and 2.39 crore people have received both the doses,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/every-phc-in-state-will-get-two-family-doctors-says-jagan/article37695597.ece

26 November 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||TDP opposes online sale of cinema tickets||Telugu Desam Party (TDP) politburo member Yanamala Ramakrishnudu has strongly objected to the State Government’s decision to sell cinema tickets online, thereby interfering with the commercial business of the theatres. In a statement on Thursday, Mr. Ramakrishnudu asked what moral right the government had to talk about the increased financial burden of cinema tickets on the public. The ruling YSRCP was shedding crocodile tears, saying cinema tickets were being sold at double rates. What was the mystery behind the government’s interference with the cinema ticket rates? With each passing day, new bankrupt policies were being brought to punish the people for giving a huge mandate to the YSRCP, he said. The former Finance Minister alleged that a “hopeless situation” existed in the State as the government was dependent on liquor income for implementing its welfare schemes. It was shameful that Amma Vodi, Cheyuta and Aasara welfare schemes were handed over to the Beverages Corporation by enacting a law, he said. The government was resorting to diversion of the 15th Finance Commission funds in an unconstitutional and unethical manner. The panchayats were suffering greatly because of lack of funds. The powers of the panchayat officers and elected representatives were usurped and vested with grama volunteers, he alleged. The government needed to explain why it was silent on the increased rates of petrol, diesel, cement, liquor and sand. “What would the government say about the overall price rise that was afflicting people?,” he asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-opposes-online-sale-of-cinema-tickets/article37695903.ece

An amendment, he pointed out, was made which says that any private aided or unaided school with less than 20 children is an unviable primary school. Referring to the prescribed procedure for withdrawal of recognition, he said where a school contravened the conditions of recognition or any provisions of the Act, the authority issuing the certificate of recognition would issue a show cause notice to the school in question, giving it a month’s time to file the reply. The order of the withdrawal should be in writing and it should also contain the name/names of the neighbourhood school/schools where the children of the de-recognised school would be admitted.

Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2021. It was mentioned in the statement of objects and reasons that the A.P.

A non-bailable warrant was obtained by the CBI on November 8 after which the Interpol has been asked to track the accused. The CBI has been in constant touch with Interpol which issued a blue corner notice containing information about Mr. Prabhakar, and is questioning all those involved in the vitriolic attacks on the judges which prompted the High Court to take a suo motu notice and get its registrar general to file complaints.

They are unable to travel long distance to acquire decent education or take up jobs which involve complex or unsafe commute resulting in a restricted pool of job opportunities for them,” says Jai Bharathi, explaining about the purpose of her 40-day motorcycle expedition across 20 cities in the country to raise awareness and encourage women to learn driving skills and enhance their job opportunities. Starting from Hyderabad on October 11, she has so far covered Bengaluru, Chennai, Kochi, Goa, Pune, Mumbai, Surat, Ahmedabad, Udaipur, Jaipur, Amritsar, Srinagar, Chandigarh, New Delhi, Lucknow, Allahabad, Patna, Guwahati, Kolkata, Ranchi, Bhubaneshwar and Vizag. Speaking to the media here on Thursday, the woman biker and founder of Moving Women Social Initiatives Foundation (MOWO) from Hyderabad spoke in detail about how she embarked on ‘Moving Boundaries’, a campaign to help women remove roadblocks within the ecosystem to increase their job prospect in transportation businesses, including as taxi and e-rickshaw drivers or agents for e-commerce companies. En route what she calls her exciting journey, she has been meeting women representing all strata and holding workshops, egging them on to aspire and achieve mobility and experience a unique sense of freedom and self-reliance. WhatsApp support MOWO has rolled out a WhatsApp-based chat box for women who want to learn driving a two or three-wheeler vehicles or apply for a job as taxi, auto or delivery rider. “Any interested person can seek information by starting a conversation with a “Hi” on the WhatsApp number +91 8885916606 and the chat box will connect them to a nearby partner organisation like ‘Even Cargo’ which offers training and employment opportunities to women,” she said, informing that the chat support is available in multiple languages. Speaking about the barriers to women’s mobility, she said it’s more of mental block rather than physical restrictions. “Through our organisation, we are trying to design context-specific solutions to perceived barriers and trying to break the ice through knowledge-sharing and collaborative-working,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/promoting-women-empowerment-through-mobility/article37695231.ece

26 November 2021||Visakhapatnam,ANDHRA PRADESH||Tomato turns costly on tight supply||The price of tomatoes is skyrocketing in the Visakhapatnam district. People say that there is a sharp increase of over Rs. 25 since the last two weeks and over Rs. 50 per kg on the tomato price in the last one month. As on Thursday, one kg of tomato was being sold for about Rs. 70 in the rythu bazaars, and for around Rs. 90 to Rs. 100 in regular vegetable markets, burning a hole in common man’s pocket. Local rythu bazaars are witnessing queue lines with people thronging the markets to purchase tomatoes that are tad cheaper, since morning. It is the effect of sudden floods, following crop damages and transportation being hit, tomato traders and vendors in the city say. “To be frank, we have almost reduced using tomatoes in kitchen and are managing with other vegetables. There is no control on the prices of tomatoes. A month ago, we purchased a kg of tomato for Rs. 22 ,” said K Suguna, a homemaker who was purchasing tomatoes at Seethammadhara rythu bazaar. S. Kiran from MVP Colony said that not just tomatoes, even the prices of other vegetables have gone up. Lady’s finger is being sold for over Rs. 60 per kg by the vendors, while the brinjal (black) is sold for over Rs. 55 a kg, he said. Estate Officer of MVP Rythu Bazaar, Visakhapatnam, G. Prasad Rao, said that traders procure tomatoes mostly from Rayalaseema, especially Madanapalle in Chittoor district. After the floods, the crop has suffered and there is no supply, as transportation has been cut off, he said. “Those who used to procure stock from Madanapalle are now importing from Raipur. Subsequently, it has increased the demand at Raipur, where again the production is not meeting the demand,” he said. He said that a few days ago, price of one of kg tomato was Rs. 74, which was the highest for the season. B. Ramu, a trader, said people used to procure two to three kg of tomatoes when the prices were hovering around Rs. 20 per kg. Now, most of the people are limiting to one or two kg, anticipating reduction in prices. In a rythu bazaars during normal times the sale was around 8 to 10 tonnes per day, it has now reduced to four to five tonnes, he said. ‘Karthika Masam’ Deputy Director (Horticulture) K. Gopi said that apart from supply being hit due to crop loss and transportation issues, there has been an increase in consumption of vegetables due to the ongoing ‘Karthika Masam’, which is also a reason for the increase in the prices. The prices may see a decline in the coming days, as the local supply is being restored, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tomato-turns-costly-on-tight-supply/article37695654.ece

He demanded that the flood victims should be extended assistance, without giving any scope for politics. He said that no one was aware as to what the YSRCP government was doing for the victims. “The BJP will raise donations for the victims from Friday by placing hundis at cinema theatres and shopping malls.

Sarma here on Thursday. He said that some of the villages have already been proposed to be covered by the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution. He said the manner in which the VMRDA has been constituted, is violative of the provisions of Article 243ZE of the Constitution, as it has no representation from among the locally elected legislators. It should therefore be deemed to have no legal authority to take up regional planning exercises, he said. Mr. Sarma has already written a letter to the Chief Secretary Sameer Sharma on the issue. He said that the VMRDA’s proposal to include the villages also violates both the Panchayat Extension to Scheduled Areas (PESA) Act and the Forest Rights Act, under which the local tribal Gram Sabhas have a special role in decision making on all matters that impinge on the lives of the local tribals. In such matters, the Governor and the President, who have been bestowed with a special responsibility, ought to have been informed prior to issuing these notifications, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vmrda-including-scheduled-areas-under-its-purview-is-illegal-says-former-bureaucrat/article37695913.ece

Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Ch, Adinarayana, ACP (Disha PS) Prem Kajal, PM Palem police and senior police officials reached the spot after coming to know about the accident.

26 November 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Police find no trail of stolen phones||Once you lose your phone, it is difficult for police to trace as most of them are dismantled, and the spare parts end up in other mobile phones. With rising mobile phone thefts, the chances of tracing them are less than 40 % as the organised mobile phones theft gangs have adopted the practice of dismantling devices and selling them as spare parts, further complicating the process of tracing. “If the devices are dismantled and the parts are sold separately, we cannot trace them with International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number, as it won’t be active at all,” a senior officer of Hyderabad city police said. The parts are sold to roadside repair shops and even to the bigwigs in the organised retail and service markets in the city and across the country. “They further fix the ‘original’ parts to damaged mobile phones at a much cheaper price when compared to authorised service centres,” the officer said. The cases of lost mobile phones in the twin cities rise month after month, but the recovery rate is less than 40 %, he said. “Each day on an average, 100 mobile phones are stolen in the city and police stations are burdened with complaints. But, a very few of them are traced and returned to the actual owners,” an officer said. The gangs are suspected to have been selling the spare parts and even full devices to some traders in the city’s refurbished mobile phones complexes at Jagdish Market, Ameerpet, Secunderabad, etc. If the device is not dismantled and the police manage to trace the IMEI numbers, the location is not just outside Hyderabad or Telangana, or even India, they are traced to Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and even in some African countries. “The gang sell the stolen devices to local shops, who in turn supply them to organised gangs outside Telangana. Later, they are exported to many South Asian and African countries,” the officer said, adding that there are several cases in which the location of the device which was stolen from Hyderabad, surfaced in other countries. “Forget about other countries, we cannot even send a team outside Telangana or even Hyderabad to recover a lost mobile phone. In such cases we are helpless,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/police-find-no-trail-of-stolen-phones/article37695670.ece
26 November 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||TRS NRI cell convenor joins Congress||Convenor of TRS NRI cell in the United States, Abhilash Rao joined the Congress, along with his supporters in the presence of TPCC president A. Revanth Reddy and other senior leaders. Mr. Abhilash Rao, hailing from Kollapur constituency, was welcomed by the Congress chief. Former Minister G. Chinna Reddy, former MP Mallu Ravi, Telangana Youth Congress president Shivasena Reddy and TPCC senior vice president Vem Narender Reddy were among those present. Welcoming Mr Rao into the party, Mr. Revanth Reddy said Mr Rao’s services would strengthen the party and he had joined the party disgusted with the kind of politics Telangana Rashtra Saithi (TRS) was playing at the cost of erstwhile Mahabubnagar district. He said Mr. Rao, who worked in the USA, returned to Telangana and worked in TRS for 15 years and had now realised that the dreams of the agitation were thrown to the winds. Mahabubnagar ‘bidda’ Mr. Reddy, terming himself as the son of Mahabubnagar soil, said Congress chief Sonia Gandhi had given a huge responsibility of running the party affairs to the Mahabubnagar ‘bidda’ and he would ensure that Congress flag flew high in the district. He said Kollapur constituency was backward and neglected but he would take the responsibility of developing it once the Congress came to power. Its lands had been taken away by the government but neither it got water nor the farmers got the compensation for sacrificing their lands, he said. Mr. Abhilash Rao alleged that KCR had been living on lies for the last seven years forgetting the sacrifices made by people for the separate Telangana and the promises he had made. “Kollapur has not changed in the last seven years. The medical facilities remain poor while farmers are continuously deceived by the government. He said Ms. Sonia Gandhi had delivered the Telangana promise despite losing political power and her sacrifice should not go waste.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-nri-cell-convenor-joins-congress/article37695680.ece
26 November 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘KCR should buy wet paddy’||The Congress continued its attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre and Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government of indulging in political gimmick to divert the attention from their basic failure of procuring paddy from Telangana farmers. Nalgonda MP and TPCC former chief, N. Uttam Kumar Reddy, who addressed a press conference along with CLP leader Bhatti Vikramarka, Manthani MLA D. Sreedhar Babu, AICC Kisan cell vice chairman Kodanda Reddy and AICC spokesperson Sravan Dasoju demanded that the TRS government buy every grain of the rainy season including the wet, discoloured and sprouted paddy. Mr. Uttam Reddy said it was laughable that Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao was threatening the Centre on the procurement of next season’s produce while forgetting his responsibility of procuring paddy of this season. He said CM should explore export options for rice rather than leaving the farmers distressed. Mr. Vikramarka said farmers were losing Rs. 5 for every quintal of paddy due to the delay and paddy got wet and was discoloured due to heavy rains. Farmers were forced to sleep on the roads after shifting paddy to the market yards. Mr. Sreedhar Babu alleged that the government was not even prepared with arrangements like buying gunny bags and finalising transport tenders for shifting the paddy and this shows its insensitivity and insincerity towards farmers. Government doesn’t even have a figure of the gunny bags needed this season.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/kcr-should-buy-wet-paddy/article37695682.ece

26 November 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Tech hub for Flow Chemistry coming up in city||An innovation and technology hub for Flow Chemistry is being established in Hyderabad by a consortium comprising stakeholders in the pharmaceutical industry and Telangana government. It is aimed at ensuring greater incorporation of Flow Chemistry techniques in pharma research and development as well as enhanced adoption of continuous synthesis for manufacturing of active pharma ingredients (APIs), IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao’s office said announcing signing of an agreement for the facility. The hub, being set up at Dr. Reddy’s Institute of Life Sciences (DRILS), will function as a centre of excellence and receive funding and patronage from pharma firms Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories and Laurus Labs. Research activities at the CoE will benefit from the scientific mentorship and support from globally-renowned scientists, including Goverdhan Mehta, University of Hyderabad, Steven Ley of the University of Cambridge, Oliver Kappe of the University of Graz, and Shu Kobayashi of the University of Tokyo. The API makers in the country are finding it difficult to adopt flow technologies and adapt to the changing paradigm of continuous manufacturing despite being awareness of the benefits of adopting flow technologies. The hub would enable a streamlined translation of a chemical process, demonstrated successfully in flow on lab scale, into one that is well-poised for continuous manufacturing with appropriate flow chemistry tools and utilities, KTR’s office said. Telangana government will be facilitating strategic support for the hub by encouraging stakeholders to onboard the consortium. Sources said the hub, expected to be commissioned by January 2022, will be a common facility for all pharma and Life Sciences firms. While Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories and Laurus Labs are founding members, more pharma firms will be joining the initiative.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/tech-hub-for-flow-chemistry-coming-up-in-city/article37695822.ece
26 November 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||HC grants 15-day interim bail to trainee IAS officer||Justice Lalitha Kanneganti of Telangana High Court on Thursday granted an interim bail for 15 days to trainee IAS officer Mrugender Lal Banoth who is accused of sexually exploiting a woman after assuring to marry her. Mrugender Lal, facing charges of raping the woman, cheating her with false promise of marriage and destroying evidences, moved the HC seeking bail. Earlier, a single judge passed interim directions instructing the police not to take any coercive action against him. While granting interim bail to him, Justice Lalitha Kanneganti instructed the trainee officer to undergo potency test and co-operate with the investigators. The judge said the investigators should issue notices under Section 41 of Criminal Procedure Code to Mrugender Lal’s parents if their role was to be examined in the case. The woman, who approached Kukatpally police leading to issuance of First Information Report (FIR) against the trainee officer, got impleaded in the criminal petition filed by him seeking bail. The trainee officer’s counsel rejected the woman’s contention that he invited her to the National Police Academy premises where he allegedly sexually exploited her with the promise of marriage. She argued that his client never invited the woman to the academy, but she on her own came there along with other relatives. She said that ‘every breach of promise to marry would not amount to rape’ citing a Supreme Court judgement. According to her, a charge of rape was not applicable in every case where a man did not marry his girlfriend after a promise. The woman’s counsel S. Rajagopalan said casting aspersions on his client amounted to character assassination. Referring to the trainee officer’s counsel’s allegation that the woman circulated her own private pictures to defame a woman relative of the officer, the judge wondered if any woman would resort to such things. The judge observed how can a trainee officer spend time with a woman on the premises of training academy. How would he serve people in the capacity of an officer, the judge remarked. The assistant public prosecutor told the court that the mobile phone through which the woman was allegedly said to have circulated obscene photos was seized. The phone was sent to forensic science laboratory to ascertain facts and the report was awaited. He said that the Kukatpally police had examined seven witnesses in connection with the case registered against the trainee officer. Further investigation could not be carried on as the HC instructed the authorities not to take any coercive steps against the officer, he said. Lawyer Rajagopalan said the trainee officer’s parents and other relatives came to her house for a compromise in the matter before she lodged the complaint with the Kukatpally police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hc-grants-15-day-interim-bail-to-trainee-ias-officer/article37695827.ece

26 November 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Indian Railways takes tech leap||Indian Railways is poised for a giant leap in technology, especially in the signalling and telecommunication front with 15,000 km being converted into automatic signalling and 37,000 km to be fitted with ‘KAVACH’, the indigenously developed Train Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) and soon the entire network of 65,000 km will be get this facility, informed Railway Board additional member Rahul Agarwal on Wednesday. Along with this, most of the lines are being shifted onto the modern Central Traffic Control (CTC) management system, so the expectation from the S&T engineering wing and consequently, the role and responsibility of the Indian Railway Institute of Signal Engineering and Telecommunications (IRISET), here in Secunderabad, will only get enhanced, he said. Participating in the 64th anniversary of IRISET virtually, the senior railway official said there will be a huge requirement of skilled manpower as these technologies get integrated and the institute will be playing a key role in developing capacities and competencies for the railways as well as the industry. Zonal railways should be part of the plan and the signalling industry should be involved in a wider role, he observed. SCR General Manager Gajanan Mallya said web-based learning modules after the pandemic outbreak has helped railway personnel to do more than one course at a time with the best of faculty available. “Safety is signalling” and vice versa, he said, adding that oxygen trains could be run on Rajdhani Express timings during the COVID second wave due to efficient signalling systems. IRISET Director General S.K. Goel said training modules were redesigned in virtual mode with limited physical classes to keep the programmes running with ‘flexibility management’ and ‘discipline’. Altogether, 5,800 trainees passed through 85 online and 27 offline courses with 1.33 lakh training man days thus far. Fresh recruits of 1,500 new trainees will be completing course by June, he said. Bharat Biotech CMD Krishna Ella, keynote speaker, in his online address, said neglected diseases in the developing nations has brought forth the COVID pandemic, causing deaths and economic destruction.

26 November 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Protest over proposed parking lot near school||The Government City Model Primary School at Chaderghat is a noisy racket during lunch break. The corridor, the classrooms, the small porch and the front of the school is filled with noisy children playing games. This was not always the case, as the school had a large open space in the middle where children could burn their energy. Things changed when the Hyderabad Metro Rail chose the plot of land for raising pillars for its Red Line connecting LB Nagar to Miyapur in 2013. The students were shifted to a nearby building while HMRL constructed the pillars and as per the agreement, rebuilt the school building, albeit in a different shape. The school, previously in a 75 by 45 metre plot of land, shrunk to a scalene triangle of 54 by 27 metres in the form of a four-storeyed building. On Wednesday, when Metro officials went to the area to do markings for a proposed parking lot, parents and students held a protest. “We were promised that the land in front of the school building will be given back to us for use as a playground. But now they are planning to do something else,” said the headmaster of one of the schools. Four schools with a strength of 1,400 children operate out of the premises. “We don’t have the space necessary for the morning assembly or serve mid-day meals. When one section of children have recess, other classes in the school cannot function due to the noise,” informed the headmaster of the primary section. The school officials showed a representation sent by the district officials to HMRL for returning the land to turn it into a playground in 2019. “We planned to construct a parking lot. But after yesterday’s protest, we have decided to keep the proposal on hold. There will be no development till an amicable solution,” said the HMRL spokesperson.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/protest-over-proposed-parking-lot-near-school/article37695666.ece

26 November 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Sisters of fraud accused tried to meet him after arrest||Two sisters — Rajini Chaudhary and Komal Chaudhary — of Deepak Chaudhary, the prime accused in RBL Bank fake call centres fraud, who are on the run, came to Hyderabad to meet and ‘help’ their brother soon after his arrest. But, suspecting their arrest by the cyber crime police of Cyberabad, the duo left the city. “We got information that both Rajini and Komal were in the city to meet him after he was arrested and brought here from New Delhi, but we suspect they feared their arrest and fled,” an officer said told The Hindu . Currently, the cybercrime teams launched a ‘manhunt’ in New Delhi and neighbouring areas to nab Deepak’s sisters and his other associates. They are also racking their brains to zero in on the bank staff who constantly leaked classified information of the fresh credit cardholders to the fraudsters. The police also suspect that both Rajini and Komal are heading the untraced call centres after the arrest of their brother and 15 others and continuing the fraud. Meanwhile, the investigators arrested one more person in connection with the multi-State banking fraud. They suspect that the arrested person sold the Caller ID spoofing application to Deepak’s gang through which they cheated thousands of credit cardholders of RBL and other banks too. “We got leads about him from another case,” the officer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sisters-of-fraud-accused-tried-to-meet-him-after-arrest/article37695835.ece

26 November 2021||KARIMNAGAR/KHAMMAM,TELANGANA||TSRTC renews focus on students||Officials of the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) have laid a renewed focus on attending to requests from students for restoration of “Palle Velugu” bus services to some villages which were discontinued for various reasons, including low occupancy ratio and COVID-19-induced lockdown in the past. Considering persistent requests from students in both online and offline modes, authorities of the public transport entity restored bus services to three interior villages - Bodu in Tekulapalli mandal, Ulvanoor in Palvancha mandal and Kakarla in Julurupadu mandal in Bhadradri-Kothagudem district a week ago. The bus services to Bodu and Kakarla were cancelled more than a decade ago owing to multiple factors such as thin occupancy rate, poor condition of roads and increased movement of private vehicles in the predominantly tribal-populated region, sources said. There had been consistent demands from various organisations representing students, farmers and agricultural labourers to restore the bus services to Bodu, Kakarla and Ulvanoor to avoid financial burden on people dependent on private vehicles for their daily commute to nearby towns. The long-felt demand of people of interior areas had been fulfilled with restoration of bus services to the three villages, TSRTC sources said. In Khammam district, the TSRTC authorities had, acting on representations from students and farmers, started/restored Palle Velugu bus services to Nelapatla and Lokya Tanda in Kusumanchi mandal, Peda Tanda, Gollapadu, Mangalagudem and Teerthala villages in Khammam rural mandal. Several students took to twitter, requesting the authorities to ply buses to their villages to enable them to attend schools/colleges in a hassle-free manner in view of full-fledged resumption of classroom instruction in the aftermath of the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic a couple of months ago. Responding to a slew of requests by students through social media and representations made by elected representatives of local bodies, the officials restored bus services between Karimnagar and Gumlapur, Karimnagar-Pochampally, Karimnagar-Ryalapalli and Godavarikhani-Gopalraopet routes in the composite Karimnagar district over a week ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rtc-renews-focus-on-students/article37695687.ece

26 November 2021||SIDDIPET,TELANGANA||Mallannasagar continues to haunt these farmers||More than a dozen residents of Lakhmapur village in Toguta mandal have lost their identity as farmers, with the entire village getting submerged under Mallannasagar , except for a few acres of land belonging to about 15 farmers. Lakhmapur was one of the eight villages that got submerged under the 50 tmcft Mallannasagar spread in Kondapaka and Toguta mandals. While the bund of the reservoir came to periphery of the village, part of lands belonging to about 15 families were untouched and they have remained with the farmers. All this happened during the construction of Mallannasagar during the last four years and at the same time, several changes took place in the Revenue department and new pattadar passbooks were issued to farmers. However, these farmers were not issued new passbooks and their repeated appeals to officials fell on deaf ears. As a result they are unable to sell their paddy produce now though they are having old passbooks issued by the Revenue officials. “We are all small farmers who have not sold our land to the government for the construction of Mallannasagar as they were not required. Out lands are located outside the bund of the reservoir. The procurement officials are refusing to buy our paddy produce stating that when the entire village got submerged under Mallannasagar, how can we produce paddy. They are not ready to accept the old pattadar passbooks and the new ones were not issued to us by revenue officials,” Pitla Srikanth, one of the farmers from the village, told The Hindu . He said that they met revenue officials even on Wednesday, but of no use. When contacted, Swamy, an official operating at the Rampur market said that the village was not yet tagged to them and it would be completed in the next two days. The procurement will be completed once the village is tagged to the centre, he explained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/mallannasagar-continues-to-haunt-these-farmers/article37695676.ece
26 November 2021||November 26 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||‘Drushyam 2’ movie review: Director Jeetu Joseph and able cast led by Venkatesh make this faithful remake watchable||To begin with, let’s address the obvious. This is the nth remake in Telugu cinema this year. Drushyam 2 , the remake of the Malayalam film Drishyam 2 (which also premiered on the same digital platform earlier this year), takes a direct digital route to release on Amazon Prime Video. The digital release has been prompted by business-driven reasons, considering that a large section of the audience has not patronised the theatres post lockdowns. The remake follows the same trajectory as the original and is nearly a scene-to-scene recreation. Director Jeethu Joseph and cinematographer Sateesh Kurup do the honours for the sequel remake (the 2014 Drushyam was directed by Sripriya and filmed by S Gopal Reddy). The jaw-dropping twists in a crime thriller masquerading as a ‘simple family story’, to quote the protagonist’s words, may not evoke the same reaction for those who have watched the original film. Drushyam ended with the whistle-worthy moment of Rambabu (Venkatesh) walking away from the police station, confident that what he did to save his family will not be found out. In his interviews earlier this year, the director admitted that he thought the story was over. However, the sequel is a great example to show how a riveting continuation can happen, leveraging on the lesser-explored psychological impact of crime. So we have Rambabu, his wife Jyothi (Meena), and their two daughters living in the shadow of fear and guilt. The societal dynamics come into fore. Rambabu had people’s support as a cable TV operator. Six years later, we see Rambabu as the owner of a theatre and planning to venture into film production. The jealousy that accompanies his growth makes life tougher for the family. Just like the first edition of the film that began in a languorous pace before moving into a thriller mode, this one too begins in a family drama format, though there is a sense of something eerie.

26 November 2021||GURUGRAM,||Haryana Govt.’s claims on forest land refuted||Environmentalist Lt. Col. (retd.) S.S. Oberoi has argued that the Haryana Government made a “deliberate mistake” in the calculation of forest area to ‘create a picture of alarm’ and justify the amendments to the Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900. He has countered the claims of the Government before the Supreme Court recently that its orders in Kant Enclave and Khori Village case would necessitate demolition in around 40% of the State. Mr. Oberoi, in his affidavit filed earlier this month, said that 40% of the State was notified under Section 3 of the PLPA for enabling protection from erosion and for conservation of subsoil water and did not mean that it was a ‘forest area’. Accusing the State of major and deliberate misrepresentation, he said that there is no regulation, restriction or prohibition placed by mere identification of areas under Section 3. He also clarified that a general Section 4 notification in no way converted areas as forests and the department had never identified these areas as forests in their records.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/haryana-govts-claims-on-forest-land-refuted/article37695804.ece

26 November 2021||JEWAR,||Jewar to be logistics gateway for north: PM||The proposed Noida International Airport at Jewar will serve as the logistics gateway for northern India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday at the foundation-laying ceremony. The airport will help small farmers export perishable commodities like vegetables and fruits, and allow MSMEs easy access to international markets through Jewar. There is a plan to develop a multi-modal hub for Jewar airport with rapid rail link from Delhi, Metro line from Noida as well as connectivity withYamuna Expressway,Western Peripheral Expressway, Eastern Peripheral Expressway, which will link it to other parts of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, apart from the Delhi-MumbaiExpressway. This hub will provide important infrastructure to artisans of Khurja, sports industry in Meerut, furniture industry of Saharanpur, brass industry of Moradabad, and footwear industry of Agra, said Mr. Modi. Industry bodies, and experts on logistics and real estate sector say that the airport will act as a “catalyst” for western Uttar Pradesh and will attract industries, improve freight movement and make the area attractive for those looking to invest in office space or a home. “The airport will have a ripple effect. There will be roads built to improve connectivity to the airport, which will serve the needs of the logistics industry by providing them improved access to hinterland and reducing transportation costs. This in turn will promote growth of local industries. This is the kind of impact an airport has on the region. It will also attract foreign investors, who always want to know how far an airport is for them,” said Jagannarayan Padmanabhan, Director and Practice Lead, Transport and Logistics, CRISIL Infrastructure Limited. “The airport will completely change the scenario for western U.P. While there are big cities like Greater Noida and Noida, their residents had to travel to Gurugram to catch a flight. The roads coming up will ensure connectivity with Delhi, Meerut, etc. ,” said C.P. Gupta, U.P State Council Chairman, Confederation of Indian Industry.

26 November 2021||New Delhi,||Submit detailed affidavit on latest status of riots cases: HC||The Delhi High Court on Thursday directed the city police to submit a detailed affidavit highlighting the latest status of criminal cases pertaining to the north-east Delhi riots of 2020. A Bench headed by Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh, hearing a batch of petitions concerning last year’s violence, gave the direction after it was informed that as on October 4, chargesheets in 361 of 758 riots cases registered had been filed. “We direct the respondent [Delhi Police] to file a further detailed affidavit giving details of cases pending before the trial courts,” the High Court ordered and posted the hearing for January 28. In the affidavit filed in October, Delhi Police said that of the 758 cases registered, 695 cases were being investigated by the North-East District Police. “At least 62 cases that pertained to major incidents like murders, etc. were transferred to the Crime Branch, which had undertaken investigations in the said cases by employing three dedicated Special Investigating Teams (SITs), and is being continuously monitored by superior officers,” the police said. “One case of larger conspiracy behind the engineering of the communal riots in Delhi is being investigated by the Special Cell,” the police said, adding that in all the cases, the legal process was at an advanced stage. Of the 695 cases being investigated by the North-East District Police, chargesheet has been filed in 315 cases and charges framed in 56 cases. Four of these cases have since been quashed by the Delhi High Court, and in two cases, the accused has been discharged. No proof against leaders Earlier, Delhi Police had informed the High Court that during the investigation conducted so far, in cases related to the riots, “no actionable evidence has surfaced yet” against political leaders “in instigating and or participating in the riots”. “As such, as and when substantial and cogent evidence of involvement of the aforesaid persons in the commissioning of any offence surfaces, Delhi Police will take suitable steps in the already registered FIRs. However, no fresh FIR is warranted at this stage,” the police said in an earlier affidavit. The police had made the submission in response to a bunch of pleas alleging hate speeches given by BJP leaders Kapil Mishra, Anurag Thakur, Parvesh Verma and Abhay Verma before the riots. One of the petitions had also sought action against Congress leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, AAP leaders Manish Sisodia and Amanatullah Khan, and AIMIM MLA Waris Pathan for allegedly giving hate speeches. During investigation, the police said it was revealed that as a part of conspiracy, protests at 21 sites were organised and largescale mobilisation was carried out in the garb of peaceful march.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/submit-detailed-affidavit-on-latest-status-of-riots-cases-hc/article37695800.ece
26 November 2021||New Delhi,||Govt. bans construction as air quality drops to ‘very poor’ zone||Following the Supreme Court directions, the Delhi Government on Thursday reimposed the ban on construction and demolition activities in the city. The court had also directed the Government to provide financial assistance to workers affected by the ban. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that he has issued directions to give Rs. 5,000 each to all construction workers. “I issued directions today (Thursday) to give Rs. 5,000 each to all construction workers in Delhi. Also, as per the minimum wage, the loss to construction workers will be compensated. We will also put up camps at construction sites to register workers,” Mr. Kejriwal said. Meanwhile, the city’s air quality deteriorated to the higher end of the “very poor” category on Thursday and is likely to worsen and remain in the same category for the next three days, according to the authorities. “The Supreme Court issued an order last night in this regard (ban on construction). Considering that, all construction and demolition work in Delhi is being banned again. Plumbing, interior decoration, electric work, and carpentry work will be allowed,” Environment Minister Gopal Rai said. The Delhi Government had banned construction activities on November 13 and lifted the ban on Monday. Talking about why the Government had lifted the ban, the Environment Minister said development work is also important and there was an improvement in the pollution levels in Delhi after the initial ban. “We are mentally prepared for everything. If the situation improves, we will consider the prospect of reopening. If the situation worsens, we will take the necessary actions. Keeping the court’s instructions in mind, construction and demolition work inside Delhi has been banned once again,” he said. Slow winds The speed of local surface winds is likely to be relatively low for the next three days and that will lead to deterioration of air quality within the “upper end of very poor” category, Government-run monitoring agency SAFAR said in a statement. “On November 29, local surface winds are likely to increase resulting in improvement of air quality but remain within the ‘very poor’ category,” SAFAR said. On Thursday, the contribution of stubble burning in neighbouring States to PM2.5 in Delhi was negligible, according to SAFAR.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/govt-bans-construction-as-air-quality-drops-to-very-poor-zone/article37695815.ece

26 November 2021||New Delhi,||Cleaning Yamuna ‘top priority’: CM||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday approved the formation of the Yamuna Cleaning Cell, terming the cleaning of the river a “top priority”. The cell will expedite the Delhi Government projects on cleaning the river and overcome any administrative hurdles, he said. Mr. Kejriwal had recently announced that the Government would clean the Yamuna by February 2025. Additionally, the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) will take over the operations and maintenance of the common effluent treatment plants (CETPs) to prevent industrial waste from falling into the Yamuna. The CM chaired a high-level review meeting on management of wastewater from industrial areas and JJ clusters in respect of cleaning the Yamuna. “In order to expedite inter-departmental decision making and execution, we have formed a Yamuna Cleaning Cell (YCC) today, headed by CEO, DJB and representatives of all concerned departments. This will expedite the Yamuna cleaning process” Mr. Kejriwal tweeted. Mr. Kejriwal instructed officials to leave no scope for loopholes in the action plan. A major hurdle being faced by the Government so far, he said, is a complex system of multiple agencies. “To overcome that, we are setting up the cell that will oversee the working of all the agencies. It will help us identify and delegate responsibility and streamline our projects,” he said. The cell will consist of six senior officials of the DJB, Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board, Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation, Delhi Pollution Control Committee, and Department of Irrigation and Flood Control looking after the sewerage systems of JJ clusters and industrial clusters, CETPs, industries violating pollution norms, Yamuna cleaning projects, and in-situ treatment. These officers will report to the DJB CEO and also be responsible for the execution of the decisions taken by the cell.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/cleaning-yamuna-top-priority-cm/article37695811.ece

Earlier this week, a Delhi court had directed the police to register an FIR against Mr. Patra for allegedly posting a doctored video of Mr. Kejriwal supporting the farm laws, saying it may have resulted in rioting like situation across the nation, a PTI report said. “Spreading fake news and posting manipulated content isn’t anything new on the BJP’s agenda. So, it was no wonder that he did not delete his tweet. You have often seen that even the BJP’s official social media handles share photos and videos that are repeatedly proven as fake and manipulated by many news agencies,” Ms. Atishi said. She claimed it seems that the entire politics of the BJP functions on the tenets of fake news and this incident of Mr. Patra is one such example.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/police-did-not-register-fir-till-court-intervened-aap/article37695812.ece

Reforms such as adopting a multi-stakeholder approach for creating awareness and sensitising people to prevent sexual abuse of children, etc. can help in increasing the safety of Delhiites,” said Praja Foundation trustee Nitai Mehta. Chinmoy Biswal, Delhi Police spokesperson said, “A majority of the 56% pending cases last year has been chargesheeted and moved to court.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/resources-reforms-needed-for-effective-policing-report/article37695803.ece
26 November 2021||New Delhi,||40-year-old man killed in garment factory fire||A 40-year-old man died after a fire broke out in a garment factory in Shahdara’s Gandhi Nagar in the early hours of Thursday, the police said. The deceased has been identified as Sanju, a resident of Uttar Pradesh’s Bulandshahar district. A fire department official said they received a call around 3 a.m. about a blaze in a factory after which six fire tenders were pressed into service. The police said that the fire tenders could not reach the exact location as the factory is in a narrow street. They said their all-night patrolling staff rushed there and extinguished the fire, which broke out on the first floor, with the help of locals. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Shahadra) R. Sathiyasundaram said a man, identified as Sanju, was found lying unconscious on the factory’s first floor. He was shifted to a nearby hospital where he was declared brought dead. The police said that there was no visible burn injury on the victim’s body leading them to suspect that he may have died due to suffocation but post-mortem will ascertain the exact cause of death. The premises were used for manufacturing and storage of shirts by one Deepak Jain of Ashok Nagar, and he was visited by a team as part of inspection, the officer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/40-year-old-man-killed-in-garment-factory-fire/article37695807.ece

26 November 2021||London,||Channel deaths fuel U.K.-France tensions||The deaths of at least 27 people in the English Channel is fuelling tensions between the U.K. and France over how to stop migrants from crossing the world’s busiest waterway in small boats. Despite a pledge from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron that they would “do everything possible” to stop people smugglers from endangering lives, politicians on both sides of the channel are already sniping at their counterparts for failing to prevent Wednesday’s tragedy. Police patrol U.K. officials criticise France for rejecting their offer of the British police and border officers to conduct joint patrols along the channel coast with the French police. French authorities say Britain is stoking the crisis because it is too easy for migrants to remain in the country and work if they manage to cross the channel. Amid the finger pointing, British lawmakers on Thursday will debate the soaring number of migrants who are crossing the channel in small boats. Mr. Macron is scheduled to discuss the issue with European Union officials. Meanwhile, migrants are continuing to brave frigid weather in small boats and unseaworthy dinghies in hopes of getting to British shores to seek asylum or better opportunities. More than 25,000 people have made the dangerous Channel crossing so far this year, about triple the total for the whole of 2020. “This tragedy was completely predictable, indeed it was predicted and it was completely preventable,” Zoe Gardner, of the Joint Council of Welfare for Immigrants, told the BBC. “This has to be a time for our government to mark a turning point.’’ “We need to offer people alternatives to the smuggling boats.” ‘Not enough measures’ Mr. Johnson said on Wednesday it was clear that French operations to stop migrant boats from leaving French shores “haven’t been enough”, despite millions of pounds of support promised by the British Government this summer meant to fund more police patrols on French beaches. But Calais lawmaker Pierre-Henri Dumont told the BBC that more patrols “will not change anything because we have 200 to 300 kilometres of shore to monitor 24/7”. “I think it’s time for both our Governments to stop blaming each other and to try and talk to each other and find real solutions, not a crazy solution such as having more and more people patrolling, sending the British Army to the French shore,” Mr. Dumont said. “That is not acceptable and will not change anything.” On Thursday, Natalie Elphicke, a Conservative member of Britain’s Parliament for Dover and Deal on the southern English coast, said it was “absolutely vital that the French police stop the boats leaving in the first place”. “Rather disappointingly, yesterday we saw the French police in footage standing by while boats got together and migrants got in them and they went off the shore in France,” she told The Associated Press. “Britain has offered to help with people and resources, and I hope the French will now take up that offer and other European countries will come to France’s aid.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/channel-deaths-fuel-uk-france-tensions/article37695121.ece
26 November 2021||Warsaw,||230 migrants crossed Belarus border by force, says Poland||Some 230 migrants forced their way through the border from Belarus with the help of Belarusian border guards but were immediately sent back across, Poland said on Thursday. “They destroyed the fence and a group of 232 people made their way several metres into Polish territory,” border guard spokeswoman Anna Michalska told Polish news agency PAP. “The officers instructed them to leave Polish territory and escorted them to the border demarcation,” she said, adding that the incident happened late on Wednesday. The EU and U.S. accuse Belarus of manufacturing the crisis by bringing in migrants from West Asia and then taking them to the border — an accusation that Belarus denies. In a statement, Polish border guards said the migrants “threw rocks and sticks at Polish forces” as Belarusian forces used lasers and strobe lighting to try and blind Polish officers. The border guard spokeswoman said five migrants were taken to hospital suffering from “exhaustion”. The border guards said there were a total of 375 attempted crossings from Belarus on Wednesday. Aid groups say at least 11 migrants have died on both sides of the border since the crisis began in the summer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/230-migrants-crossed-belarus-border-by-force-says-poland/article37695113.ece
26 November 2021||Kabul,||Hazara elders pledge support for Taliban, call for inclusive Govt.||More than 1,000 Afghan Shia Hazaras pledged their support on Thursday to the country’s new Taliban rulers, insisting that the “dark period” of previous Western-backed Governments had ended with the return of the Islamists. Afghanistan’s Hazaras have been persecuted by Sunni Islamists for centuries, but on Thursday community elders gathered in Kabul alongside Taliban leaders in a show of support. Senior Hazara leader and former lawmaker Jafar Mahdawi, who organised the gathering, said the previous Government of President Ashraf Ghani was the “darkest point” in the history of Afghanistan. “Afghanistan had no independence and (foreign) embassies ruled every aspect of the Government,” he said. “Thank God, we have now passed this dark period.” Since the Taliban seized power in August, the new rulers have put an end to the war, stopped corruption and increased security, Mr. Mahdawi said. But he called for a more inclusive Government from the Taliban and urged the new rulers to reopen schools for girls.  Taliban leader and spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told the gathering that rebuilding the country was a priority. “Our jihad against the foreign invaders has ended and now we will start jihad for building the country,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/hazara-elders-pledge-support-for-taliban/article37695110.ece

Travis McMichael, who shot Ahmaud Arbery, his father Gregory McMichael, and their neighbour, William “Roddie” Bryan, who took part in the chase, were all convicted of multiple counts of murder, aggravated assault and false imprisonment. A predominantly-white jury in Brunswick, Georgia, deliberated for less than 12 hours over two days before delivering their verdicts. Travis, 35, Gregory, 65, a retired police officer, and Bryan, 52, face potential life in prison for the February 2020 shooting of the 25-year-old Arbery. A crowd erupted in cheers outside the courthouse as the verdict was announced, chanting: “Say his name. Ahmaud Arbery!” “Today is a good day,” Arbery’s father, Marcus, told the gathering. “I don’t want to see no daddy watch their kid get lynched and shot down like that.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/three-found-guilty-of-murdering-african-american-man-in-georgia/article37695116.ece
26 November 2021||Moscow,||Russia puts into orbit classified military satellite||Russia on Thursday successfully placed into orbit a military satellite believed to be part of the Kremlin’s early warning anti-missile system. A Soyuz rocket carrying a classified payload blasted off from the Plesetsk cosmodrome in northern Russia in the early hours of Thursday morning, the Defence Ministry said.  According to the Spaceflightnow website, which covers space launches, the launch could be delivering a Tundra satellite. Russia has previously launched Tundra satellites in 2015, 2017 and 2019, according to Interfax. Specialist website Russian Space Web said the ground track of Thursday’s launch “matched previous missions” delivering satellites for Russia’s missile warning system named Kupol or dome. Unveiled in 2019, Kupol is designed to detect launches of ballistic missiles and track them to their landing site, though its exact configuration is unknown.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/russia-puts-into-orbit-classified-military-satellite/article37695114.ece

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the deployment includes a detachment of 23 federal police officers and up to 50 more to provide security at critical infrastructure sites, as well as 43 defence force personnel, a patrol boat and at least five diplomats. “Our purpose here is to provide stability and security,” he said. Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare declared a lockdown on Wednesday after about 1,000 people gathered in protest in the capital, Honiara, demanding his resignation over a host of domestic issues. Tensions between the Government and the leadership of the most populous island of Malaita have been simmering for some time. The premier of Malaita has been outspokenly critical of Mr. Sogavare’s 2019 decision to cut the country’s diplomatic ties with Taiwan, switching its diplomatic allegiance to China instead. The province has also complained it has been unfairly deprived of Government investment. The protesters on Wednesday breached the National Parliament building and burned the thatched roof of a nearby building, the Government said. They also set fire to a police station and other buildings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/australia-sends-troops-to-solomon-islands/article37695120.ece

26 November 2021||November 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Is the crypto asset boom sustainable?||One of the defining economic trends of the year has been the rise of cryptocurrencies. After the Supreme Court’s decision last year overturning the Reserve Bank of India’s 2018 order banning financial institutions from enabling cryptocurrency transactions, there has been a huge rush of retail investors into cryptocurrencies. Yet, the risk of the government cracking down on private currencies has remained. On Wednesday, the Centre announced that it will introduce a bill in the upcoming winter session of Parliament seeking to ban private cryptocurrencies, albeit with a few exceptions. Many commentators see the rise of cryptocurrencies as a bubble, while enthusiasts of cryptocurrencies see it as unstoppable. In a conversation moderated by Prashanth Perumal J. , Parag Waknis and Akshat Shrivastava discuss the government’s move. Edited excerpts: What is the fundamental value that cryptocurrencies offer investors? Parag Waknis:Traditionally, gold has been one of the options for investors to not only hedge against inflation, but also against the risk that is inherent in any financial system. Now, cryptocurrency is another such asset that allows people to invest outside the traditional financial system. It is not regulated and its value fluctuates, probably more than gold. But as we have seen over the pandemic, it has offered phenomenal returns, much more than gold has been able to offer. It’s always debatable whether the current valuation is the appropriate valuation or not. There are going to be disagreements about what should be the value of cryptocurrency. So, many people might call it just a bubble. But then, it doesn’t have to be stigmatised just because it’s a bubble. Akshat Shrivastava:First and foremost, cryptocurrencies are an entire asset class, not just one asset. The primary advantage of cryptocurrencies is the mathematically designed blockchain network with finite supply. The primary problem with the current monetary set-up is that when the government starts printing more money, the value of your money gets wiped out due to high inflation. You can’t do that with Bitcoin. So, cryptocurrencies give you a better hedge against inflation compared to gold by better ensuring limited supply. Gold has been a great asset in the past, but the supply of gold is not mathematically designed. So, Bitcoin is a sounder, fundamental currency. Second, there are systems and processes that can be developed around the blockchain network, such as decentralised finance systems. For example, when you transfer money to your friend in the U.S., there are significant charges that you incur if you go via any major bank in India. It’s a friction that can be eliminated by the use of technology. But do cryptocurrencies really have any use or exchange value to say they have fundamental value? PW:Blockchain technology itself has great potential to reform financial record-keeping and keeping track of asset transactions. So, that is one major use of blockchain technology. Now, when it comes to currency as such, cryptocurrencies are more like hedge assets. So, cryptocurrency is equivalent to gold. We do not expect people to walk into a store and directly use cryptocurrency to buy goods and services. Cryptocurrencies still have to be converted into some actual currency that can be used. We do not quote prices in terms of Bitcoins. Governments do not accept taxes in Bitcoin or Ethereum. So, the word currency is a misnomer. But what gives cryptocurrencies as assets an advantage over cash or fiat money is the fact that they exist outside the purview of the government. In the days just after demonetisation, people looked to invest in cryptocurrency. When people see that the value of a particular asset can be wiped out overnight by a government diktat, that is enough to create some amount of distress trust in the good. Most of the investments after demonetisation have been in real assets. So, cryptocurrencies may not have immediate use in terms of going into a store and buying something but they are basically a hedge against any system-wide action that can wipe out the value of any particular asset. AS:Right now there are more than 20,000 businesses that are accepting Bitcoin. People can buy a bunch of digital products using Bitcoin. If you move to certain countries, you can transact in fractional values of Bitcoin. So, there is no problem in terms of transacting in Bitcoin. In fact, you can’t go to Starbucks and pay in gold to buy a coffee. That is not possible. Second, there is something fundamentally off in how the monetary system currently works. Economists would say that fiat money is a store of value and a medium of exchange. Is fiat money a medium of exchange? Yes, it’s a very good medium of exchange. But is the current fiat money a store of value? Absolutely not. The reason why Bitcoin became prominent was that the value of fiat currencies was being eroded systematically. Right from 2008, due to quantitative easing, money supply was increasing and every time the government turned on the money-printing machine, the value of the money that you saved went down. So, people started looking for better alternatives where one cannot create money at their own will and potentially wipe out your savings. The fundamental value of Bitcoin is that it is a great store of wealth. Since cryptocurrencies are competing against fiat currencies, don’t they face the risk of government sanctions? AS:It depends on how you’re defining it. For example, if you’re defining cryptocurrencies as an asset class, then they are competing against something like gold, not against fiat money. If you actually structurally understand this entire problem, the U.S. dollar is going to be the biggest beneficiary from this entire crypto movement. There is a reason why senators in the U.S. are accepting their salaries in Bitcoin. By the end of this year, a substantial share of the U.S. population will have some sort of cryptocurrency in their wallets. Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase and Ray Dalio were both crypto critics at the beginning, but they have now come to embrace it. The adoption of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, has been the fastest adoption of any technology. It is literally changing the way you’re interacting with technology. If you say that you are going to ban Bitcoin, or that you are going to ban Ethereum, then the bottom line is that you’re actually saying no to a big part of technology that can prove to be revolutionary. Think about it this way. For example, if India decides to ban Ethereum, we would have essentially said no to the entire decentralised finance system, because no other developers will come and build a blockchain network for you and power it up for you. It’s like saying a government has the potential to beat Facebook in terms of building a social media network. PW:It’s wrong to ban any asset unless there are compelling reasons. And I do not really find any compelling reason in this particular case. You are basically going to create an underground market. And people will continue to invest in crypto assets. It will be hard to regulate. It would probably increase the penalty cost and more risk-averse investors would be dissuaded from investing. But overall, other than the desire for complete control over the monetary system, I don’t see any other motive or economic rationale for banning crypto assets. So, the government should not do it. In fact, it should build a proper regulatory framework and allow investment because it’s like any other asset. Then there are great benefits to the blockchain network itself that the government can use for financial record-keeping. It’s antithetical to say that the government will ban the private crypto network and come up with its own crypto network because the whole idea of a crypto network is having a decentralised record-keeping system, and the government having monopoly over a decentralised record-keeping system does not make any sense. What would be the benefits of having different currencies competing against each other? PW:Private currencies could have a beneficial effect in disciplining the central bank. In Zimbabwe, for example, the government printed a lot of money and then the currency lost value. People then moved to the U.S. dollar for transaction purposes. This in turn forced the Zimbabwean government to enact some monetary reforms, curtail the supply and have some kind of a benchmark to the U.S. dollar so that the Zimbabwean dollar could regain the ground that it had lost because of increasing supply. So, one of the beneficial effects of competing currencies is the disciplining effect it has on the central bank or on fiat money. Governments cannot just willy-nilly keep increasing the money supply since people will then always have the option to shift to other payment instruments. This was the classic dilemma that Milton Friedman actually posed, that we kind of accept that monopoly is bad in most cases in the economy but we kind of take the monopoly power of the central bank for granted without questioning it. There are examples in history where private banking notes have functioned very well and there are examples where they have failed too. There is a lot of research that goes into why they were successful and why they failed. But overall, it seems that if a private currency has certain characteristics such as scarce supply that is guaranteed, a criterion that many cryptocurrencies satisfy, then it could actually perform as a competing payment instrument that could discipline the central bank. There are plenty of historical examples for this. No single instrument can have all the advantages anyway. But every payment instrument comes up with some advantage and some disadvantage. So, we can kind of figure out which technology or which currency works better for what purposes and then think of some way of creating a financial system which harnesses all these new instruments, rather than cracking down on them. AS:The current monetary set-up has serious flaws. That is the primary reason why cryptocurrencies have grown at such a massive scale. The adoption of cryptocurrencies has been one of the fastest for anything in technology ever in human recorded history. There are massive pitfalls in how the current monetary set-up is managed. Every time there is a problem, the solution is to print massive amounts of money, and every time the government prints money, it creates irreparable damage to people, especially at the bottom end of the society. That’s point one. Second, money printing is not an economic question. It’s a political question. There is always more demand among governments to spend than the supply of funds available. And in order to satiate that demand, more money is printed. If people understood this economic concept they would be demonstrating on the streets.  It’s wrong to ban any asset unless there are compelling reasons to do so. You are basically going to create an underground market. And people will continue to invest in crypto assets. It will be hard to regulate. Parag Waknis||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/is-the-crypto-asset-boom-sustainable/article37695106.ece
26 November 2021||November 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Having an ear to the ground in Punjab||Punjab is restless. It is in pain. It feels let down by the State’s politics, its leaders and political parties. A sense of its political alienation from Delhi is palpable. It desperately wants to trust somebody. It is looking for that somebody. Perhaps it also knows, at the back of its mind, that there is hardly anybody it can depend on. And that finally, when the time comes, it has to choose a political platform that is less undependable, and unwillingly settle for it for the next five years. Price rise, drug menace, joblessness, farm laws, fall in incomes, increase in thefts, lawlessness, insult to sacred text cause anguish to its people. What is more painful to them is the perception that its political leaders and successive governments are indifferent to these issues. There is hopelessness in the young of the State. Even in tiny villages, the walls have the screaming advertisements of agencies that offer visa and immigration help to Canada and Australia. So too for institutes that coach students for the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) tests. Meeting a cross-section A few short months before the elections to the State Assembly, this is the mood of the State that I gathered after a 10-day intensive tour. I clocked about 2,000 kilometres, traversing the three main regions of the State — Malwa, Doaba and Majha. I met over 500 people representing almost all sections of society: men and women, in villages and towns, the rich and the poor, the young and the old, farmers, labourers, the unemployed, students, employees. Some individually and some in small groups. They were all surprisingly forthcoming in expressing their views and generous with their time. I also had long conversations with academics in universities and research institutes. I deliberately avoided meeting political party leaders. Impact of farm laws rollback On the morning of the last day of my travel came the unexpected announcement by the Prime Minister declaring his intention to repeal the three farm laws. The immediate reaction of the man on the street was one of jubilation. However, I could not find signs of an abatement of anger against the Prime Minister, his party, and the Union government. In Punjab, the repeal announcement is unlikely to fetch the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) political dividends. The anger is intense; the wound, raw. In many conversations the Prime Minister was referred to less than respectably. The recent reopening of the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor has not generated the kind of goodwill the State BJP leadership has expected. As things stand today, the BJP has little or no chance of being in the reckoning in the coming elections. The Shiromani Akali Dal is viewed with suspicion because of its association with the BJP. The Akali Dal’s quitting the National Democratic Alliance over farm laws has not helped the party recover its lost political ground. Its panthic support base too is unhappy on account of the party’s inaction in the case of tearing off pages from the holy book, the incident known as Bargari Kand. The Akali Dal government did not bring the culprits to book. Instead it is seen as the government that fired on those who protested against the desecration. A large number of devout Sikhs are yet to forgive the party for the deaths of two people in the firing. Many who voted for the Akali Dal in the last Assembly elections intend to move away from it this time. There is a strong indication of a further erosion of its support base. Those who intend to remain with it lack passion and continue to extend support without enthusiasm. Gauging the Congress There is a widespread feeling that the Congress government under Captain Amarinder Singh did not deliver on its promises. Two things are held against the former Chief Minister. First, that he did not fulfil the promise he made to curb the menace of drugs. The fact that soon after he took office, he swore on the Gutka Sahib, the Sikh holy book, to assure the people that he would eliminate the drug menace and yet failed to take resolute action has earned him the wrath of the public. Second, he is seen as an inaccessible leader. Punjab is in no mood to indulge the Maharaja this time. Association with him adds no political value to the BJP even after the repeal of the three farm laws. Punjab refuses to see the Union government’s climbdown on the farm laws as anything but a victory for the agitation. And surely not as the Prime Minister’s generosity or an outcome of Captain Amarinder Singh’s pressure on the Union government. In the event, the yet-to-be-registered political party of the former Chief Minister is likely to be stillborn. AAP’s prospects The recent significant political development in Punjab is the replacement of Captain Amarinder Singh with Charanjit Singh Channi as the Chief Minister. The move, undoubtedly, has implications for the electoral fortunes of the Congress. By extension, it also is likely to impact the prospects of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Until the change of guard, AAP has seen a huge surge in support. The State was disillusioned with the Congress government under Captain Amarinder Singh. In fact, the opinion that the Captain, the top leadership of the Akalis and the BJP’s central leadership are working in league has gained ground. Therefore, the Congress under Amarinder Singh was seen to be as unelectable as the Akali Dal and the BJP are. The sections who preferred the Congress to the Akali-BJP combine in the last polls began their shift to AAP. They wanted to give the untested party a try. That accounts for the massive surge in AAP’s support before the new Chief Minister, Mr. Channi, took over. With the change of guard, however, those sections are having second thoughts. It is evident that some of those sections are on their way back to the Congress. The change of guard manoeuvre has blunted the sharp edge of anti-incumbency to some extent. There is one remarkable thing in the political conversation in Punjab. Mr. Channi has managed to become a household name in a short time. He being the first Dalit Chief Minister of the State lends a social dimension to the discourse. People are prepared to watch him. They seem to have reserved their judgment about him and the Congress. The extent of damage the running battle between the Chief Minister and his State party chief can cause is yet unclear. But that it will cause damage is certain. Weighing in The biggest loser as a result of the Congress party’s repositioning is AAP. There is a lot of goodwill for the party at present among all sections of Punjab society. It is more pronounced among the young and first-time voters. It is able to attract erstwhile voters of both the Akali Dal and the Congress. Many women in remote villages too said they wanted to give the new party a chance. However, AAP lacks organisation, cadre, and recognisable faces in many constituencies. Some people see it as a party with roots outside the State. Its biggest handicap, however, is its procrastination over announcing the Chief Minister face. Electorally, the Congress and AAP are in a tight contest, with a slight edge for the ruling Congress at the moment. The one who commits less errors will have more chances of winning. However, mistakes of AAP and the Congress do not have equal potential for damage. AAP’s mistakes are likely to be less damaging to it. Whereas even small mistakes by the Congress can drastically swing the mood of the State in favour of AAP which is seen as an alternative that deserves a chance. When they return home from the agitation, the mood of Punjab’s highly networked and well-informed farmers can be a clincher.

26 November 2021||November 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Setting the tone at Glasgow, the job ahead in Delhi||With current per capita emissions that are less than half the global average, India’s pledge to reach ‘net zero’ emissions by 2070 has cemented India’s credentials as a global leader. The emissions of all others who have pledged “net zero’ by 2050 are above the global average. At COP26 in Glasgow (October 31-November 12, 2021), India successfully challenged the 40-year-old frame of global climate policy that pointed a finger at developing countries with the alternate frame of ‘climate justice’, that unsustainable lifestyles and wasteful consumption patterns are to blame. The political implication of the date 2070 is that the world should get to ‘net-zero’ by 2050. For that, the rich countries will need to do more and step up closer to their share of the carbon budget. India’s stand also signals that it will not act under external pressure, as requiring equal treatment is the hallmark of a global power, and will have an impact on other issues. G7 no longer a rule setter The problem, as Gandhiji had also observed, is really western civilisation; it also accounts for the spate of criticism of India’s open challenge in the plenary, and getting global agreement on a “just” transition to phase down, and not phase out, coal. The subject of oil was not touched, even as automobile emissions are the fastest growing emissions, because it is a defining feature of western civilisation. Coal is the most abundant energy source, essential for base load in electrification, and the production of steel and cement. Its use declines after the saturation level of infrastructure is reached. The irony of the host country pushing other nations to stop using coal — an energy resource which powered its own Industrial Revolution — was not lost on the poor countries who called out “carbon colonialism”. That India and China working together forced the G7 to make a retraction has signalled the coming of a world order in which the G7 no longer sets the rules. The Prime Minister’s stand in the opening plenary, pushing ‘climate justice’, and the Environment Minister, Bhupender Yadav’s constant reminder that the negotiating text is not balanced as there is little advance on financial and other support, gave courage to the others to also successfully question the negotiating frame which focused on emissions reduction. After 40 years there is more specific language on both finance and adaptation finally recognising that costs and near-term effects of climate change will hit the poorest countries hardest. India will be investing The debate has now shifted to the national level, with questions on the feasibility of the goal of ‘net-zero’ by 2070. Here again, most of the concerns mirror those raised in the West without appreciating the significance of ‘climate justice’. Seeing the challenge in terms of the scale and the speed of the transformation of the energy system assumes that India will follow the pathway of western civilisation where the energy system and lifestyles that evolved over a century have to be transformed over the next 30 years. India is urbanising as it is industrialising, moving directly to electrification, renewable energy and electric vehicles, and a digital economy instead of a focus on the internal combustion engine. Most of the infrastructure required has still to be built and automobiles are yet to be bought. India will not be replacing current systems and will be making investments, not incurring costs. West must cut consumption There is sufficient evidence in the literature that the consumption of affluent households both determines and accelerates an increase of emissions of carbon dioxide. This is followed by socio-economic factors such as mobility and dwelling size. In the West, these drivers have overridden the beneficial effects of changes in technology reflected in the material footprint and related greenhouse-gas emissions. Climate change has to be addressed by the West by reducing consumption, not just greening it. For India, in parallel with the infrastructure and clean technology thrust, the focus on a decent living standard leads to behavioural change in the end-use service, such as mobility, shelter and nutrition — for change modifying wasteful trends. First, consumption patterns need to be ‘shifted away from resource and carbon-intensive goods and services, e.g. mobility from cars and aircraft to buses and trains, and nutrition from animal and processed food to a seasonal plant-based diet’. Second, along with’ reducing demand, resource and carbon intensity of consumption has to decrease, e.g. expanding renewable energy, electrifying cars and public transport and increasing energy and material efficiency’. This should be the focus Third, equally important, will be achieving a’ more equal distribution of wealth with a minimum level of prosperity and affordable energy use for all’, e.g., housing and doing away with biomass for cooking. Indian civilisational values already lay stress on vegetarianism, frown on wastage; mobility-related consumption is not disproportionately increasing with income. National acceptance of a ‘floor’ as well as ‘ceiling’ of sustainable well-being is feasible. The Government now needs to set up focused research groups for the conceptual frame of sustainable well-being. It should analyse the drivers of affluent overconsumption and circulate synthesis of the literature identifying reforms of the economic systems as well as studies that show how much energy we really need for a decent level of well-being. The West has yet to come out with a clear strategy of how it will remain within the broad contours of its carbon budget. The political problems of a scaling-down of economic production and lifestyles will provide useful lessons. It is becoming difficult for the West to use international trade that is shifting manufacturing and the burden of emissions to developing countries with the rise of a digital economy. And increasing inequality and a rise of protectionism and trade barriers imposing new standards need to be anticipated. This knowledge is essential for national policy as well as the next round of climate negotiations. Work for Parliament After the Stockholm Declaration on the Global Environment, the Constitution was amended in 1976 to include Protection and Improvement of Environment as a fundamental duty. Under Article 253, Parliament has the power to make laws for implementing international treaties and agreements and can legislate on the preservation of the natural environment. Parliament used Article 253 to enact the Environment Protection Act to implement the decisions reached at the Stockholm Conference. The decisions at COP26 enable a new set of legislation around ecological limits, energy and land use, including the efficient distribution and use of electricity, urban design and a statistical system providing inputs for sustainable well-being.

26 November 2021||November 26 2021 00:00 IST,||In Andhra, the capital question||A few days ago, the Andhra Pradesh government passed a Bill to repeal the Andhra Pradesh Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Act of 2020 and the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority (Repeal) Act of 2020 so that it may come up with a more comprehensive legislation that “dispels the wrong notions of the land-givers in Amaravati” and clarify its position on the legalities raised by the petitioners in the High Court. Upset that the government intends to introduce a more comprehensive legislation in place of the revoked three-capital Act, the farmers in Amaravati have vowed to launch a State-wide march demanding that Amaravati be retained as the single capital of A.P. It is evident that the government has been firm on decentralised development. Following the bifurcation of erstwhile A.P. in 2014, the A.P. government pooled in over 33,000 acres of land from farmers in 29 villages of the Amaravati region, promising a world-class mega capital. It was planned that Amaravati would have nine other ‘cities’, including a ‘knowledge city’ a ‘government city’ and a ‘justice city’. The exercise was initiated to develop the region and pass on the benefits to the farmers. The present government says this is not possible. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy said A.P. lost the fully developed Hyderabad to Telangana during bifurcation and remains a victim of lopsided development. He blamed the previous government for making lofty promises which will saddle the State with a massive fiscal deficit. Instead of a ‘super capital’, Amaravati will be the legislative capital, he said. In the context of this, the Andhra Pradesh Assembly passed the Andhra Pradesh Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Repeal Bill, 2021, which revives the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority Act, 2014. As part of the development plan, the government may liquidate the available land left after designated plotting for development of the Amaravati region, sources say. The government has also stated that the unfinished roads of Amaravati will be developed and put to use with the available resources. However, it has ruled out investment to the tune of lakhs of crores of rupees due to a cash crunch. The Development Agreement-Cum-Irrevocable General Power of Attorney signed by the Amaravati farmers and the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) in 2014 enables the government to go ahead with its plan. The Agreement favours the government, according to legal experts, as it stipulates that the farmers shall not claim any amount in addition to the amount agreed upon as compensation and accept it without any protest. The 33,000 acres of land were acquired through a Land Pooling Scheme brought in by the then Chandrababu Naidu government. The government had announced that for every acre of land given for land pooling, 1,000 sq yards of residential plots and 450 sq yards of commercial plots will be returned to the land owners. In addition, it promised an annual payment of Rs. 50,000 for 10 years with annual increase of Rs. 5,000 irrespective of the category of land. The Agreement says farmers cannot claim higher compensation in any court of law and will not be entitled to file any petitions in this matter. The Agreement also facilitates irrevocable rights to the government to develop the land. The courts in the Krishna and Guntur districts have exclusive jurisdiction to entertain any disputes arising out this Agreement. The government is moving fast to get a “better” Decentralisation Bill passed by the Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council where it enjoys a majority. Whatever the government does, it is paramount that it protect the interests of farmers who sacrificed their lands and livelihood. appaji.r@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/in-andhra-the-capital-question/article37695108.ece
26 November 2021||November 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Raiding party||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s national ambitions are intriguing and daring. Soon after she led the Trinamool Congress (TMC) to a stellar victory in the Assembly election earlier this year — third time in a row — she set out on an extension scheme, though no coherent strategy is apparent. There is indeed a personal factor — she was savagely targeted by the BJP during the election. She triumphed over the BJP, still struggling to evolve a suitable politics for its Bengal foray, but it appears that the score was not settled. Ms. Banerjee had sensed the emerging confrontation between her politics and the BJP’s early on. In January 2019, she assembled leaders of 23 Opposition parties at a public meeting at Brigade Parade Grounds in Kolkata, where they pledged to defeat the BJP. Her victory over the BJP was conclusive, but the BJP is waiting in the wings to unseat her, having grown to about 70 seats in the Assembly from three in 2016. The Trinamool leader claims she is trying to take the fight to the enemy, her focus right now being Tripura and Goa, where the BJP is in power. There is a large Bengali population in Tripura, and the BJP is unnerved. In both States and beyond, the TMC is recruiting disgruntled leaders from other parties and free-floaters. The party is driven by Ms. Banerjee’s charisma rather than an ideology. The TMC has swung both ways — alternating between the BJP and the Congress in the past. The Bengal government run by the party does not shy away from celebrating the anniversary of Shyama Prasad Mookerjee, the founder of Jana Sangha, as a proud son of Bengal. Though the edge of her politics is anti-BJP at the moment for strategic considerations, it is the Opposition parties, particularly the Congress that is paying for her expansion spree. Between 2011 and 2021, the entire rank and file of the Congress shifted to the TMC in West Bengal, and the story is being repeated now in other States. On Wednesday, 12 of the 17 Congress MLAs in Meghalaya joined the TMC. Sushmita Dev and Luizinho Faleiro, defectors from the Congress, are central to the TMC plans in Tripura and Goa, respectively. The induction of Ashok Tanwar, a former Congress MP from Haryana, and a Dalit, may signify a broader plan for the Hindi States. Dalit politics is at a crossroads in the heartland as the BSP is facing extinction, and there is vacuum to be filled. Ms. Banerjee has been outspoken on questions regarding federalism, and the Centre’s unilateralism that undermines it. Whether all this is sufficient to catapult the TMC as the axis of anti-BJP politics nationally is an open question. At the moment, the TMC challenge is less to the BJP and more to the Congress.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/raiding-party/article37695093.ece
26 November 2021||November 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Measuring progress||A periodic assessment of health and social development indicators is crucial for any country that is still clawing its way towards achieving ideal standards in the Human Development Index. While the results of the NFHS are usually mixed, and improvements in certain sectors ride along with stagnation and deterioration in other sectors, this year, there have been radical improvements in maternal and child health, sex ratio and population control. A greater proportion of births than ever before is now happening in institutions, more children in the 12-23 months age group have received their vaccinations, and, most interestingly, India has achieved a total fertility rate of 2.0, dropping further from the figure of 2.2 during NFHS-4, indicating that India has contained the population explosion. Policies, some even coercive, as in the case of the family planning sector, seem to have borne fruit, years after they were implemented. While gender ratio has, for the first time, recorded more women per 1,000 men, gender ratio at birth in the last five years still underlines the persistence of a deep-rooted son preference, one that has to be countered, through policy and law. There are other areas too, specially in the case of childhood nutrition where marginal gains in say, wasting and severe wasting, are deemed insufficient, and require renewed corrective efforts. The impact of the pandemic may also be noted, the disruption it caused to services such as balanced nutrition for children must be acknowledged, while this set of circumstances underscores the need for building resilient and fortified systems capable of delivering in the most trying circumstances. Having measured blood sugar and hypertension in the population for the first time, NFHS-5 highlighted the looming threat from lifestyle diseases. This massive exercise that covered, this year, over six lakh households across the country, aims at providing data that will help shape the policies in a manner that will correct deficiencies, and ensure equitable access to services, particularly those with impact on social determinants that improve the quality of life. State-level indices are also released, to provide comparisons, but also to allow States to launch course correction, or to be inspired by success stories in other regions. Inputs on marriage and fertility, family planning, access to education and health services are provided by the NFHS, arguably second only to the exhaustive data that the decennial population census throws up. States need to treat it as such, and while they might dispute some assessments, the greater idea is to recognise it as a matrix to work on, to improve the development indicators further. Meanwhile, the Centre too must not treat it as a mere stocktaking exercise, but harness the opportunities the NFHS provides for launching reform or re-assessing certain policies without using it as a political tool in a federal set up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/measuring-progress/article37695094.ece

The latest list of incidents on the eastern and western borders released by the Defence Ministry to-night did not reflect the true nature of the deepening crisis with the focus temporarily shifting from the military to the political sphere. Apart from the continued Pakistani shelling across the West Bengal and Tripura borders involving some civilian casualties, there has been no major engagement either in the eastern or western regions since the tank battle in the Boyra area of the Jessore sector on Sunday.

We already do,” said Vikram Pawah, President, BMW Group India. “What we are talking about is do we want to wait for certain years before bringing these technologies into the country or are we ready to fast-track these technologies into the country for the betterment of the country,” he added. While EV makers including Tesla and Hyundai have sought duty cuts, Indian firms such as Maruti Suzuki, and Tata Motors have opposed it, saying local manufacturing should be incentivised instead. “We’re not asking for a blanket exemption... these could be either time-limited exemptions or quantity-limited. Then it is a clear path, there’s a clear sunset date,” Mr. Pawah explained. He said BMW would unveil three electric mobility products in the next 180 days. The first car would be the BMW iX next month. “There is not enough demand yet [for EVs],” he said. “There is inquisitiveness about it, but the demand is not there because of factors such as not enough products available, lack of charging infrastructure and the policy framework,” Mr. Pawah said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/bmw-to-roll-out-3-new-evs-in-india-favours-import-duty-cuts/article37694889.ece

Moody’s projects India’s economic growth will rebound strongly, with GDP expanding 9.3% in the current fiscal ending March 2022, followed by 7.9% in fiscal 2023. In a report, Moody’s said credit fundamentals were favorable for India’s firms on a sustained economic recovery and earnings of rated companies would rise on strong consumer demand and high commodity prices. India’s rising vaccination rate, stabilising consumer confidence, low interest rates and higher public spending underpin positive credit fundamentals for non-financial firms, it said.  Growing government spending on infrastructure will support demand for steel and cement. Meanwhile, rising consumption, the push for domestic manufacturing and benign funding conditions will support new investments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/strong-demand-pace-of-jabs-augur-well-moodys/article37695079.ece

26 November 2021||Madrid,||No Nadal as Spain begins title defence||Spain is set to begin its title defence at the Davis Cup Finals without Rafael Nadal, and with all eyes on the teenager touted as his heir. The 18-year-old Carlos Alcaraz will be attracting attention when Spain starts on Friday against Ecuador. Spain is looking to triumph again two years after winning the inaugural edition of the revamped nations’ competition. The tournament wasn’t played in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Debut Coming off a title at the Next Gen ATP Finals, Alcaraz will be making his first Davis Cup appearance alongside Pablo Carreno Busta and Albert Ramos-Vinolas, who are both more than 10 years older than him. Alcaraz wasn’t even born when another member of Spain’s team, 40-year-old Feliciano Lopez, began playing on tour. “For me it’s a dream come true to be here,” the No. 32 Alcaraz said Wednesday. “I watched this tournament since I was a kid and I always wished to be here representing my country, so I’m really excited to be with the team.” Left-foot injury Nadal went undefeated in singles and doubles when Spain won the title in 2019, but the 20-time Grand Slam champion isn’t playing this year because of a left-foot injury that ended his season early. “It’s true that we had a big advantage. If you have Nadal in your team you go straight to being the favorite because he is the best player in the history of the Davis Cup,” Spain captain Sergi Bruguera said. Alcaraz is capping an impressive season that included a quarterfinal appearance in the U.S. Open and victories over top-10 players Stefanos Tsitsipas and Matteo Berrettini. Bruguera said Alcaraz has helped bring new life to the team with his great character. “Carlos is an unbelievably nice guy, he’s very humble,” Bruguera said. “And he’s adjusting very well. He’s happy. The veterans are very good friends already and Carlos is like fresh air in the team. It’s nice.” Tough task Spain is facing a difficult task trying to retain the title, though, as the other team in Group-A is a Russian squad featuring two top-10 players in No. 2 Daniil Medvedev and No. 5 Andrey Rublev. Also in the team is Olympic silver medallist Karen Khachanov and 2021 Australian Open semifinalist Aslan Karatsev. Russia will be called the Russian Tennis Federation (RTF) during the event amid an ongoing doping suspension from international sports. “It’s the strongest team,” Bruguera said. “It’s the most complete team, with Medvedev probably the most in-form player right now, so it will be our most difficult rival.” Spain’s team took a hit when No. 19 Roberto Bautista Agut had to be replaced by No. 45 Ramos-Vinolas at the last minute because of an abdominal injury.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/no-nadal-as-spain-begins-title-defence/article37695247.ece
26 November 2021||KANPUR,||Debutant Shreyas and Jadeja give India the first day’s honours||Sunil Gavaskar never gets tired of reiterating the importance of batters converting a good start, particularly in Test cricket. On this day, in perfect batting conditions at the Green Park Stadium, some Indian batters were guilty of not putting a price tag on their wickets. They did all the hard work to get their eye in but could not proceed to optimise their stay. The saving grace was the domination of debutant Shreyas Iyer and Ravindra Jadeja in the third session that made India feel a lot better by raising the total to 258/4 at stumps. Good recovery The importance of the ongoing 113-run stand can be understood well if one considers India’s awkwardness on being reduced to 145/4 in the second session. New Zealand had its moments when comeback-man Kyle Jamieson was rewarded with three wickets for his consistently teasing line close to the off-stump — the dismissal of Mayank Agarwal was a prime example. None of the bowlers looked half as effective. In fact, young half-centurion Shubman Gill did have some luck when replays showed that left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel could have won a leg-before verdict in his first over had he asked for a referral. Clearly, the day belonged to Shreyas. He, too, had slices of luck but did not hold back his natural flair for striking the ball. Spinners made no impression on the Mumbai batsman who played an assertive role in the partnership with Jadeja. Promoted ahead of Wriddhiman Saha, Jadeja proved an ideal foil for Shreyas and reached a 17th Test half-century. He batted cleverly and scored briskly. As a result, this right-left combination seized the initiative in the final session that produced 104 runs in 28 overs. Earlier, Gill did not hold back his stroke-making instincts and hit his fourth half-century. Though not convincing, the run-making of Gill ensured the first session belonged to the host. Cautious duo After Gill’s fall in the first over of the second session, the cautious duo of Cheteshwar Pujara and skipper Ajinkya Rahane missed out on an opportunity to strike big. Pujara’s 88-ball 26 and Rahane’s 63-ball 35 ended with inside edges leading to their dismissals. After Pujara played a delivery away from the off-stump line to be caught behind, Rahane’s attempted cut left his stumps shattered. Earlier, New Zealand’s decision to leave out two left-arm bowling options, spinner Mitchell Santner and speedster Neil Wagner, raised eyebrows. In opting to strengthen its batting, the visiting team brought in debutant Rachin Ravindra, who also bowls left-arm spin. As expected, the off-spin of William Somerville was preferred as a second spin option after Ajaz. But so far, these Kiwi spinners have not troubled the Indian batters and it was not surprising to find all four wickets falling to the faster bowlers. Tim Southee, who scalped Pujara, did have his fitness issues but returned to bowl another spell. India fractionally ahead Reflecting on the day’s play, Jamieson said, “I found the swing early and it was up and down a little bit. Hopefully, the new ball swings a little bit in the morning and we can get them. India is a fraction ahead but I think we hung around pretty well. We need a good start in the morning.”  That’s the thing about Test cricket, you have to read the conditions fast. In this particular innings, I wasn’t able to read that ball. I wasn’t expecting it to reverse Gill   It’s nice to be back out there. Probably I think not having game time in the IPL and the T20 World Cup gave me a chance to take a step back and work on a few things Jamieson||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/debutant-shreyas-and-jadeja-give-india-first-day-honours/article37695197.ece
26 November 2021||GURUGRAM,||Back-to-the-wall win for Nitin||Nitin Kumar Sinha survived three match points and converted his seventh match point for a 6-4, 3-6, 7-6(8) victory over eighth seed S.D. Prajwal Dev in the pre-quarterfinals of the $15,000 ITF men’s tennis at the Tennis Project on Thursday. Watching the action, coach Zeeshan Ali who trains Nitin at the National Tennis Centre, was quite proud of his performance and the overall quality of the contest. To his credit, Prajwal played with remarkable intensity, especially in the climax when he saved six match points, but Nitin just about managed to nose ahead. In the quarterfinals, Nitin will play Nicolas Tepmahc of France who beat Karan Singh in straight sets. Karan had the big game but not the high degree of concentration, and thus could not build on the good work of beating second seed Niki Poonacha in the first round. While the French man converted four of five breakpoints, Karan could capitalise only on two of 11. Manish Sureshkumar roared after subduing Alexis Canter of Britain 3-6, 6-2, 6-4. Manish led 4-1 in the decider, before the Briton levelled the scores. Manish saved two breakpoints in the ninth game to hold serve, and converted the second match point to close the contest that lasted two hours and 55 minutes.

26 November 2021||London,||Sporting gatecrashes into last 16||The parade of European powers advancing to the Champions League knockout stage was disrupted by Sporting Lisbon completing a stunning turnaround to join them. Manchester City and Real Madrid are back in the round of 16 after beating teams they lost to in September. Paris Saint-Germain also goes through despite its 2-1 loss at City. Madrid’s 3-0 win at Sheriff ensured Inter Milan also advanced from Group D by beating Shakhtar Donetsk 2-0. Sporting ended a 13-year wait by beating Borussia Dortmund 3-1. Pedro Goncalves scored twice. Sporting seemed overmatched in September when routed at home by Ajax then beaten in Dortmund, but three straight wins lifted the surprise Portuguese title-winner to advance with a game to spare. Ajax and Liverpool extended their dominating group-stage campaigns with fifth straight wins. Ajax’s 2-1 win at Besiktas came thanks to two goals from record-setting forward Sebastien Haller. Haller is the fastest player to get to nine goals in the competition. Liverpool cruised to a 2-0 win over Porto and moved an astonishing 10 points clear of the Portuguese team in second place in Group B that promises a tense final round on Dec. 7. AC Milan is still in contention after finding an 87th-minute goal from a 30-year-old Champions League debutant to win 1-0 at Atletico Madrid. Junior Messias’s goal left both teams on four points with Milan next hosting Liverpool and last-place Atletico going to Porto. Leipzig overwhelmed Club Brugge 5-0 in Belgium in their battle to finish third in Group A behind Man City and PSG.   The results: Group A: Club Brugge 0 lost to RB Leipzig 5 (Nkunku 12, 90+3 Forsberg 17-pen, 45+1, Silva 26); Manchester City 2 (Sterling 63, Jesus 76) bt Paris Saint-Germain 1 (Mbappe 50).   Group B: Atletico Madrid 0 lost to AC Milan 1 (Messias 87); Liverpool 2 (Thiago 52, Salah 70) bt FC Porto 0.   Group C: Besiktas 1 (Ghezzal 22-pen) lost to Ajax 2 (Haller 54, 69); Sporting Lisbon 3 (Goncalves 30, 39, Porro 81) bt Borussia Dortmund 1 (Malen 90+3).   Group D: Inter Milan 2 (Dzeko 61, 67) bt Shakhtar Donetsk 0; Sheriff Tiraspol 0 lost to Real Madrid 3 (Alaba 30, Kroos 45+1, Benzema 55) .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sporting-gatecrashes-into-last-16/article37695091.ece
26 November 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Anekha scalps top-seeded Bhavana Menon||Unseeded K. Anekha (Kozhikode) brought off a major upset as she ousted the top seed Bhavana Menon (Ernakulam) 2-11,11-9, 11-9, 7-11, 11-4 and enter the women’s singles quarterfinals of the Bank of Baroda-State table tennis championships at the Jimmy George indoor stadium here on Thursday. The Ernakulam girl seemed in fine fettle as she began strongly, taking the opening game without much sweat, but thereafter wilted under pressure applied by Anekha with a consistent display. The only time that Bhavana threatened to stage a comeback was in the fourth game, but the Kozhikode player was not to be denied as closed out the final game in style. Anekha’s sister, Ankitha, seeded fifth, also bowed out, losing to Reena Anna Michael (Alappuzha), 4-11, 11-9, 10-12, 13-11, also in the pre-quarterfinals. Another upset witnessed at the same stage was the 5-11, 11-3, 11-6, 11-8 win eked out by Thiruvananthapuram’s Pranathi P. Nair over the seventh seed Maria Cicily Joshy (Alappuzha). N.K. Harshitha (Palakkad) won the girls’ under-11 title with an easy 11-6, 11-5, 11-6 win over Thrissur’s Julia Jijo in the final.  The results: Women: Singles (pre-quarterfinals): K. Anekha K ( Kzde) bt Bhavana Menon (Ekm) 2-11, 11-9, 11-9, 7-11, 11-4; Seraha Jacob (Alp) bt Adheena K.

26 November 2021||Brisbane,||Australian bowlers bat for Paine||Australia’s bowlers want Tim Paine behind the stumps for the first Ashes Test against England because he is “the best keeper in the world”, spinner Nathan Lyon said on Thursday. Paine quit as Test captain in disgrace last week over a text message scandal, but is keen to keep playing. Selectors must decide whether to cut him loose and start afresh or show loyalty amid a groundswell of support to keep him in the team for the opening clash in Brisbane on December 8. Opener Marcus Harris on Wednesday said Paine had the backing of the Australian squad and Lyon — who is one wicket away from claiming 400 Test scalps — reiterated this. “The selectors always said they were going to pick the best available XI and in my eyes Tim Paine is the best keeper in the world,” he said. “I know I want him. Every bowler’s relationship with (him) is exceptional and Tim Paine is a very loveable guy and a very well-respected guy within the changeroom.” Lyon added: “Tim made a mistake, he’s owned it, for me that shows great courage, to be honest.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/australian-bowlers-bat-for-paine/article37695236.ece
26 November 2021||Chennai,||Mahindra Racing optimistic ahead of testing||Ahead of the first pre-season testing for the 2021-22 season of Formula E, the electric single-seater championship that starts next week in Valencia, Indian team Mahindra Racing is optimistic of a good run after a few years of struggle. Mahindra Racing has been part of the series since the first year in 2014-15 and this will be the final season for the Gen2 car before the Gen3 car is introduced next year. Downturn The team showed good progress for the first few years finishing as high as third and fourth in the third and fourth seasons respectively. Since then it has slipped to ninth over the last two years. Dilbagh Gill, Team Principal of Mahindra Racing, though feels optimistic about his side’s chances this year. Gill spoke to The Hindu ahead of the launch of Formule E Unplugged, a documentary series about the last season, similar to F1’s ‘Drive to Survive’ where there will be an episode centring around the Mahindra team. “I don’t want to say a number like second or third but I would say we will be back in the top half of the championship. We are in the bottom half right now, we’ll come back to the top half,” said Gill on his targets for this year. Explaining what has held the team back, Gill said, “Our weakness essentially has been largely around tyre management and a bit of a race strategy.” “In qualifying, we have always been one of the best teams, we can get the best single lap pace out of a car. But in race pace is where we are (lacking). We have been good at preparing for the sprint but not for the marathon. For the race, there is a bit more strategy, you push for a bit, you hold back and we are tuning ourselves towards nailing race pace,” he added. No Indian driver The team in its inaugural year had Karun Chandhok, only the second Indian to race in Formula One, as one of its drivers but since then has not had an Indian behind the wheel. Vacuum of talent When asked about that, Gill said, “We haven’t had the resources even though we had the intention. “There has been a vacuum of talent but some really good drivers like Arjun (Maini) and Jehan (Daruvala) are coming up even though they are largely F1-focused so far.” “We have had some conversations and, I would say I think at some point in time, I don’t want to jump the gun, but there would be some Indian talent joining the team,” he added.  We have been good at preparing for the sprint but not for the marathon. For the race, there is a bit more strategy, you push for a bit, you hold back||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mahindra-racing-optimistic-ahead-of-testing/article37695239.ece
26 November 2021||Barcelona,||Real Madrid relying on Benzema||Karim Benzema and the teams that employ him appear unfazed by his guilty verdict for having played a part in the sex tape blackmail plot against a former France teammate. Hours after the conviction by a Versailles court on Wednesday, Benzema helped Real Madrid clinch a spot in the Champions League knockout phase for a 25th consecutive season by scoring in a 3-0 win at Sheriff. Benzema should be back in action again on Sunday, when Madrid hosts Sevilla in a clash of two of the hottest teams in the Spanish league. At age 33, Benzema is essential to Madrid. Once criticised in the Spanish capital for not making the most of his talent, he has emerged from Cristiano Ronaldo’s shadow to become one of Europe’s most reliable scorers. Madrid leads the league, with Sevilla only two points back in third place. Sevilla has boosted its attack this season. Newcomers Rafa Mir and Erik Lamela have combined for nine goals to lead the deep squad coached by former Madrid manager Julen Lopetegui. Second-placed Real Sociedad will be hoping for Madrid to stumble as it visits Espanyol on Sunday trailing Madrid by just one point. Atletico Madrid, is in fourth place, four points back. Xavi Hernandez will coach his third game for Barcelona when it visits Villarreal on Sunday. His debut was a 1-0 win over Espanyol last weekend followed by a 0-0 draw with Benfica at Camp Nou midweek.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/real-madrid-relying-on-benzema/article37695246.ece
26 November 2021||KOZHIKODE,||Arjun — the new shining star||It turned out to be an unforgettable week in Kolkata for Arjun Erigaisi. And he wasn’t even supposed to be there for a week. The 18-year-old from Warangal was scheduled to play only the rapid section of the Tata Steel Chess, which he won, after being seeded eighth in a field of 10. Opportunity knocks Then, on the eve of the blitz tournament, an unwell B. Adhiban pulled out and he was replaced by Arjun. Two days later, he finished runner-up in that event too, after tying for first with Levon Aronian of Armenia. “I was delighted to get that opportunity in the blitz, as I would have preferred it in the first place, to the rapid event,” Arjun told The Hindu. “I never expected to win the rapid tournament; I would have been happy with a third.” Arjun played some superb chess to finish ahead of the likes of Aronian and Le Quang Liem of Vietnam, not to mention his compatriots. The fact is, before the Tata Steel tourney, Arjun was not known much outside chess circles. His name was not familiar to most people the way Nihal Sarin’s or R. Praggnanandhaa’s was. Little wonder hence that Viswanathan Anand termed Arjun a “great discovery and the new star of Indian chess”. “I felt very happy when he said that (during a press conference),” said Arjun. “I have been working with him of late and he helped me a lot at Kolkata.” As for not hogging the limelight like Nihal or Praggnanandhaa, he said it didn’t matter much. “But, I thought I wasn’t getting as many invitations for stronger tournaments,” he said. He added it would be nice if he got some sponsorship. “My parents have been taking care of my expenses, but I think it would be great if that burden is softened by some sponsors,” he said. “Chess at the highest level is very expensive.” World championships Arjun’s focus now is back on classical chess. “I will be playing two tournaments in Spain over the next few weeks,” he said. “I am also looking forward to the World rapid and blitz championships (to be held from December 26 in Kazakhstan).” After his exploits in Kolkata, he surely will be one of the players to watch out for there.  I felt very happy when he said that. I have been working with him of late and he helped me a lot Arjun on praise from Anand||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/arjun-the-new-shining-star/article37695234.ece

India showed better coordination and rhythm to maintain pressure from the start and took the lead in the sixth minute with Uttam Singh hitting home a back pass from Maninder Singh inside the circle.  The host pumped in goals at regular intervals. Sanjay got his second hat-trick and Hundal his first as India scored seven of its goals through penalty corners.

26 November 2021||November 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Blasters miss chances aplenty||Kerala Blasters messed up a wonderful chance to grab its first win of the Indian Super League and had to be content with a goalless draw against NorthEast United at the Nehru Stadium, Fatorda, on Thursday night. The Blasters’ Argentinian forward Pereyra Diaz and midfielder Sahal Abdul Samad muffed lovely chances but the goalless draw, the first in ISL’s eighth edition, brought the two teams their first points this season.  The two side had suffered bitter 2-4 losses in their opening round and appeared to be a bit cautious in the opening half. The first half was slow, there were many mispasses too and both teams struggled to keep possession. Luna stands out Blasters’ midfielder Adrian Luna was one man who stood out, winning the ball frequently and coming up with nice runs and passes, but he did not get much support from the others. Blasters’ first good opportunity came in the 36th minute with Diaz finding a way into a near-empty box from the left. He danced past a defender and appeared to be at the right place, but delayed his attempt a bit and shot wide. Five minutes into the second half Vincy Baretto, who was making his debut, came up with a brilliant run on the right and sent a promising cross into the box but Samad, who ran and received it, sent it wide under pressure. Brilliant save Towards the end, NorthEast goalkeeper Subhasish Roy came up with a brilliant save to deny Spaniard Alvaro Vazquez, whose arrival towards the 70th minute appeared to give new life to the Blasters attack. Much was expected from NorthEast forward Deshorn Brown but he appeared to have an off day.  The result:   NorthEast United FC 0 drew with Kerala Blasters 0   Today’s mat ch: FC Goa vs Jamshedpur FC, 7.30 p.m .   Both teams gained their first points of the season NorthEast forward Brown appeared to have an off-day||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/blasters-miss-chances-aplenty/article37695200.ece

The event was cancelled last season due to the pandemic. A card of ten events has been framed for the Derby day with the total prize money for the mega event being Rs. 40 lakh, including a winner’s purse of Rs. 24 lakh.  Among the dozen contestants vying for supremacy, trainer Pesi Shroff’s Zuccarelli, who shed his maiden status last Sunday here, maintains his winning form and is the prime contender. He also holds a good record of running third in the Deccan Colts and was second to Miracle in the Deccan Derby at Hyderabad. Bengaluru-based trainer Rajesh Narredu’s colt A Star Is Born, who won well in his last start and also has impressed in his morning trials, may fight for honours. Queen O’ War, who is in good shape as evidenced by her track performances, may pose a threat. Another ward of trainer P. Shroff, Sunrise, who won very well in his debut, is capable of causing an upset. Other attractions The other attractions of the day would be the F.D. Wadia Trophy and the Noshir & Dolly Dhunjibhoy Sprint Million, with the total stakes money of Rs. 1 million each.

26 November 2021||Galle,||Sri Lanka beats Windies||Lasith Embuldeniya took five wickets in the final innings as Sri Lanka thrashed the West Indies by 187 runs in the first Test here on Thursday to go 1-0 up in the two-match series. Chasing 348, West Indies was bowled out for 160 before tea on the final day, with Nkrumah Bonner the lone warrior with an unbeaten 68 on a turning wicket at the Galle International Stadium. Rare double-digits Bonner was one of only three West Indies batsmen to make it into double figures. Joshua da Silva (54) and Rahkeem Cornwall (13) being the others. Sri Lanka secured a 156-run first-innings lead thanks to a masterful 147 by Dimuth Karunaratne and four wickets by Praveen Jayawickrama helping to scuttle the visitors for 230. With rain washing out some play and storm clouds threatening, Karunaratne starred again in Sri Lanka’s second innings with 83, aided by Angelo Mathews who made 69, to set the West Indies a huge task. Reeling at 52 for six at the start of the final day, the West Indies clung on with Bonner and da Silva putting on 100, the West Indies’ highest partnership of the match.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sri-lanka-beats-windies/article37695081.ece

26 November 2021||November 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Nepomniachtchi could test Carlsen like never before||Unlike the precedent seen in the days leading to many World chess championship title matches, the polite exchanges between two friends, champion Magnus Carlsen and challenger Ian Nepomniachtchi, is a welcome change. These fierce over-the-board rivals gave a fine account of themselves and a peek into their mindset when taking questions from the media on Wednesday, less than 48 hours before commencing their much-anticipated 14-game encounter at the Dubai Exhibition Centre as part of the Expo 2020 Dubai on Friday. Nepo, as he is fondly called in chess circles, will play with white pieces in all odd-numbered games in the first half. In the second, Carlsen gets a similar privilege. Cheeky replies Asked who could win the $2 million title-clash, the Russian challenger kept his response simple. “Well, normally I think the best player wins!” In contrast, Carlsen’s tongue-in-cheek reply was, “I predict that the person who scores the most points over the next three weeks is going to be the winner, and hopefully that’s going to be me. And if I do win, it will probably be because I made a lot of good moves and good decisions under pressure.” Carlsen is an overwhelming favourite to retain the title held since dethroning Viswanathan Anand in 2013. Though Nepo leads Carlsen 4-1 after 11 encounters in their head-to-head encounters over the past two decades, it includes two victories that came during their junior days. Though Carlsen is clearly a better player with more experience in World championship matches, Nepo’s chances rest on his astonishing sense of positions where the battle for seizing advantage looms large. A prime example of this quality was Nepo’s victory over Carlsen in 2011. Secondly, Nepo’s opening preparation from the white side is often seen as his potent weapon. Here, Carlsen relies more on his general understanding of positions rather than banking on deeper preparation of the lines over the board. Unlike Carlsen’s rivals in two previous title-matches, Sergey Karjakin and Fabiano Caruana, Nepo plays sharp, double-edged positions. This normally leads to tactical battles which not only engages the spectators but also ends up producing more decisive battles.  The chess world is excited about the upcoming contest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/nepomniachtchi-could-test-carlsen-like-never-before/article37695194.ece

26 November 2021||November 26 2021 00:00 IST,||The way back||Silambarasan aka Simbu’s career hit a pause when whispers about his unprofessionalism came to surface after AAA in 2017. As the whispers grew louder, with some producers even asking for compensation for losses incurred, Simbu felt he had hit rock bottom. The accusations and name-calling accumulated so much that Simbu says he did not know how to manage or even come out of the pitfall that he created. The journey turned out to be a long-term project than a quick fix. In an industry where issues related to mental health are either brushed aside or lack sensitivity, Simbu is a rare Tamil cinema star who has been vocal about what he went through. Starting out as a child actor in his father T Rajendar’s films, Simbu admits that it was a low-point in his long career that only caused damage. He describes that phase as his “lockdown”, quite literally. “I didn’t feel like coming out of the house and interacting with people. In spite of all that, I was acting and was trying to socialise with people,” says Simbu, dressed in an olive green V-neck T-shirt, during a press interaction ahead of the Venkat Prabhu-directed Maanaadu that released yesterday. The actor turned to spirituality to come out of that place. “ I believe my potential will reflect in my work.” The realisation of having swam his way through was what happened recently when Simbu become emotional at the audio launch of Maanaadu . He made a dramatic statement, addressing his fans and well-wishers: “I will take care of my problems, you take care of me.” Simbu says he tried controlling his pent-up emotions, but he could not. “Even for this film [ Maanaadu ], there were a lot of problems from the start. We started shooting and then it was dropped, and we started again. The film, my weight loss journey and the pandemic — all of this affected me when I went on stage,” he says. Set against a political backdrop,  Maanaadu (Campaign) is about the concept of time loop, where the characters are trapped in a series of events that repeat themselves. But Simbu clarifies that the film is not overly political. Nor is he worried if audiences would understand such a high-concept. In fact, what drew him towards Maanaadu was how simplified the concept has been presented by its director, Venkat Prabhu. “It is about a normal guy getting caught in this time loop [like Edge of Tomorrow and Source Code ]. Though the scenes repeat, you will see something new. That is what Venkat Prabhu has done, in a commercial way.” For Simbu, it was as much a journey of self-discovery as it was spiritual. In due course, he says he learnt a lesson or two; and how he has evolved as an actor-person. Which is why Simbu says he will not do a film like Vallavan in today’s times. “I was a boy then and hence acted in such commercial films. I have come out of that zone now. Cinema too has changed. Audiences are watching all sorts of content and they are no longer liking the cinema thanam ,” he says, adding, “We need to cater to what today’s audiences want. For that, you will have to work with directors who are doing that.” Simbu has been talking to young filmmakers, although nothing has been finalised yet. In the next one year, he wishes to stay committed to his acting projects. “I like the zone I am in right now...it’s peaceful. I need this space for me.”  I was a boy when I did films likeVallavan. I have come out of that zone now. We need to cater to what today’s audiences want Simbu   Spiritual Journey Simbu went through a drastic physical transformation last year, losing nearly 27 kilos. Lockdowns are when Simbu got the breathing time to schedule his day. “In the past, I have put on and lost weight for my character [like in Silambattam ]. But once you hit 30, your body doesn’t listen to you,” he says. Simbu switched to liquid diet, in addition to a fitness regimen that included working out and playing sports such as tennis, cricket and basketball. “My body couldn’t take it for the first two weeks and I struggled a lot. But that is something you should overcome.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-way-back/article37695045.ece
26 November 2021||November 26 2021 00:00 IST,||A little luck, seven tiles and a whole lot of words||In a game of Scrabble, you do the best you can with the tiles you draw. At the ongoing international Scrabble tournament which commenced on November 20, eight contestants from India are pitting their vocabulary against 120 players from more than 40 countries. Known as the World English-Language Scrabble Players Association Championship (WESPAC), it is the first time the tournament has gone online, due to COVID-19-imposed travel restrictions in many countries. “As this board game is popular in most English-speaking nations, each country, based on its historical performance, is given a quota for the number of people they can nominate. This quota increases over time and India has moved up from the initial one seat to four. This year the Indian contingent has been allotted four wildcard spots as well,” says Sudhir Kamath, president, Scrabble Association of India (SAI). The championship is a biennial event that began in 1991 and India’s first entrant, Mohan Chunkath who participated in 1999, is an entrant in this edition as well. “This is the first time I will be playing a serious tournament online, even though I have been engaging with other gamers in the online format way before the pandemic — there is a dearth of serious Scrabble enthusiasts or a club in most cities,” rues Chennai-based Mohan, 65, a retired IAS officer. However, Mohan, who is a five-time holder of the National Champion title, says many youngsters have taken to the game in recent times. Two of the four wildcards allotted to India were granted to preteens — Madhav Gopal Kamath (11) from Delhi and Suyash Manchali (12) from Bengaluru — who are among the youngest players to have participated in a WESPAC event. Both boys developed a passion for the game watching the adults in their family. The lack of a Scrabble club or group in either of their schools, has not dulled their enthusiasm. Though there is a youth tournament for those under 18 and a senior citizens’ one for those above 55, at the world championships there is no age classification — all entrants will face off with each other at least once. “This is the first time I will be playing a main event online against other adults and I am a bit nervous,” says Madhav Gopal Kamath, a class VI student at Sanskriti School in Delhi. Madhav, who came second at the U-18 championship this August, has been competing online and with his father to prepare for the event. Suyash Manchali is nervous too, though he has participated in the World Youth Cup twice. Now a class VII student of MES Kishore Kendra School in Bengaluru, Suyash says, “I was seven years old and I saw my mother was fascinated with these small squares with both alphabets and numbers that you could count. She is the one who taught me to play.” The Indian team at WESPAC 2021 will be led by reigning national champion Sherwin Rodrigues from Mumbai, and includes Udayan Grover from Pune, Mohan Chunkath from Chennai, and Nakul Prabhu from Mumbai as well as wildcard holders Sanjoy Gupta and Suyash Manchali from Bengaluru, Kala Ganesh from Mumbai and Madhav Gopal Kamath from Delhi. “All participants will play 32 games each, squaring off with a different opponent every time. A system of totalling scored points and winning margins determines the ranking of each player. The top 20 move on to the finals — a knockout stage featuring the top eight players,” says Sudhir. The tournament will conclude on December 5 and is being held online every weekend.

26 November 2021||November 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Meet Ainthinai, a Tamil band from Kerala||Ainthinai is the latest addition to the growing tribe of indie bands from Kerala. The five-member acoustic band recently launched its debut single, ‘Vaasam pesum’, a Tamil number. ‘Ainthinai’ is the concept of five geographical landscapes mentioned in Sangam literature — kurinji (hills), mullai (forests), paalai (desert or dry regions), marudam (crop land) and neithal (coastal terrain). “Our songs are about people, environment, flora and fauna, soil, culture…. We wanted a name connected with that. Also, it had to be a title that would make people think,” explains Athul Subrahmanyan, lead vocalist, bass guitarist and lyricist of the band. Other members of the band are Cebe Babu (lead guitar), Rahul R Shenoy (cajon), Sarath M (violin) and Thomas Poulose (rhythm guitar). Opting for Tamil The band sings in Tamil. “We agree that the language is poetic and that aspect resonates with the themes of our songs. We are confident that listeners will be able to understand the content because the lyrics are simple,” says Athul. Nine more songs are ready for release — ‘Vaasam pesum’, ‘Sirikkanam’ , ‘Thaaye’ , ‘Manithan’ and ‘Ooru’ . ‘Vazhkai’ celebrates the beauty of earth. ‘Vidu’ is a call for freedom. The fivesome started jamming together and performed at cafes in and around Kochi. “We played both original songs and covers and were surprised by the appreciation we got for the originals,” says Rahul. The group makes special note of Shiyas MM, who supported them by letting them play at his dine-in place at Aluva, which they still do. The pandemic and lockdown brought everything to a standstill, including their practice sessions at Aluva, where most of the members hail from. However, once the restrictions were lifted they regrouped with a plan. “We knew that nobody was going to reach out to us in that scenario. So we decided to approach cafes in and around Kochi looking for opportunities to perform. Being an acoustic band, we just had to walk in with our instruments,” says Rahul. “We had confidence in our music, but did not know how to go about promoting it. The only option was looking for a space to present our work,” adds Cebe. Big break That decision struck gold. At Edam Art Café they had a chance meeting with singer Sithara Krishnakumar. The same evening, she introduced them to Wonderwall Media, which manages her and other leading bands and musicians like Thaikkudam Bridge. “They took us on board. Our life turned upside down that day,” says Cebe. They did two shows in Kochi and one in Thiruvanathapuram. The group is also looking at promoting a new music culture. Before every important gig, they plant a sapling at the venue. They have also planned music workshops. “There are places where people have not seen a music instruments. We want to show them the instruments and teach them how to play. We also want to take something from their culture,” says Athul. On what keeps them together, Cebe says, “We have creative differences when we sit down to compose. But we always reach a consensus. There is something special that binds us like a family.” ‘Vaasam pesum’ is on YouTube and Spotify.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/meet-ainthinai-a-tamil-band-from-kerala/article37695043.ece
26 November 2021||November 26 2021 00:00 IST,||For the record||Over a Zoom call on a rainy day in Chennai, I flaunt my 1999 cassette cover of Deewana , one of Sonu Nigam’s hit albums. Sitting across a few thousand miles, inside a London suite, the singer flashes a grin that changes into a big smile very quickly. “The business of music was very one-dimensional back then,” he says, referring to the beginning stages of his career, “But so many things have changed since then. I have been witness to sweeping changes in the music industry — from cassettes, disks and CDs to digital platforms.” He is part of another huge trend currently: venturing into non-fungible tokens (NFTs), thanks to a partnership with Jet Synthesys. “It’s something precious, either from the past or a future prospect,” he says, “It is especially for people who value the artiste or content, and for those who treat it as an investment.” Sonu’s debut in this space will feature a special track titled ‘Hall of Fame’, which he worked on with composer-lyricist Jim Beanz a couple of years ago. “I have sung thousands of songs in the last few decades, but this was among the toughest to sing,” he reveals, “The reason I like legends like Mohammad Rafi and Kishore Kumar is not because of their evergreen hits, but because they have attempted some songs that are very difficult to sing. ‘Hall of Fame’ is my attempt to do something like that.” After ‘Hall of Fame’, the singer plans to release some other creative work of his as NFTs; that includes some hand-written papers that he personally wrote before recording some of his hit numbers. “I have this habit since I debuted as a singer; I always write the place, time and date and team working on it, when I record my songs, apart from marking my comments with respect to the scale and pronunciation. For any music lover or collector, to possess that sheet written by a singer is precious, because it is a memory only he or she can share.” In the future, he even hopes to work on albums exclusively for the NFT world. “I was mulling about doing something exclusively, probably on the works of Mir Taqi Mir or Faiz Ahmad Faiz. A musical project for an audio label is familiar among audiences, but a project exclusively as an NFT would be niche.” If he does that, it will be a flashback for him. For, Sonu Nigam is well known for his non-filmi musical outings in the Nineties. What gave him the confidence back then? “I realised that a lot of art could be created beyond it through independent projects. I was open to trying newer things.” It was probably that urge to break boundaries that led Sonu to the South. He is no stranger to Tamil music, having debuted with AR Rahman’s ‘Varayo Thozhi’ from Jeans (1998) and also subsequently singing for GV Prakash and many other composers. “I am lucky to have got the opportunity to work with the likes of Ilaiyaraaja and AR Rahman,” he says. “Late singer SPB was one of my special musical gurus; in fact, I sang ‘Aasman Kehta Hai Rab Se’ ( Mast ) keeping his delivery style in mind.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/for-the-record/article37695044.ece
26 November 2021||November 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Director Sujana Rao on ‘Gamanam’: Ilaiyaraaja’s appreciation was the best compliment||“It will not be an exaggeration to say that the rains have played a character in my film and that I dedicate this project to the memories of monsoon from my childhood,” says first-time director Sujana Rao, while discussing her Telugu film Gamanam . Scheduled to release in theatres on December 10, Gamanam stars Shriya Saran, Shiva Kandukuri, Priyanka Jawalkar, Suhas, Charuhasan and Nithya Menen (in a cameo). The anthology film, produced by cinematographer Gnana Shekhar VS along with Venki Pushadapu and Ramesh Karutoori, explores how characters in three stories cope with a deluge following torrential downpour. Sujana reminisces, “A few years ago when I was studying at National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), we used to visit a nearby waterbody and take photographs. Later we noticed the area being turned into a construction site. Each year when there’s flooding in Hyderabad or Chennai, we read about how it is a man-made disaster, as waterbodies get encroached in the name of urban development. That made me write Gamanam .”   Gamanam was filmed in 2019 and the post production happened during the pandemic. The producers were keen on a theatrical release: “I am grateful for their faith in the project,” says Sujana. Unhinged approach Shriya plays Kamala, a young hearing-impaired mother who has to rough it out on her own. Shiva Kandukuri is an aspiring cricketer supported by Priyanka Jawalkar. Charuhasan agreed to play a crucial role and Sujana recalls how the veteran actor, now in his 90s, was game to film as heavy rains pelted down on him. She also lavishes praise on the efforts of Priyanka Jawalkar, Shiva Kandukuri and the other actors in the ensemble cast, including two boys who were roped in to play street children. Their scenes in the trailer might remind one of the Tamil film Kaaka Muttai , where street kids yearn for an expensive treat, but Sujana asserts that the similarities end there. Maestro’s music The icing on the cake was getting Ilaiyaraaja to compose the music: “He said he does not take up a project if he does not like the story. I had narrated most of the story but even before I could complete it, he stood up and asked one of the team members to take a photograph of us. He remarked, ‘we are doing the film’. I was overjoyed.” Later, watching the rough cut of the film, Ilaiyaaraja would remark that the film mirrors life-like situations and that he could not budge from his seat while watching the second half: “This was the biggest compliment for me.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/director-sujana-rao-on-gamanam-ilaiyaraajas-appreciation-was-the-best-compliment/article37695049.ece
26 November 2021||November 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Making of a MasterChef||In this remote bylane of Thillai Nagar in Tiruchi, a banner congratulating Devaki Vijayaraman for winning the title in the first season of MasterChef India — Tamil works better than Google Maps in helping us locate the low-profile victor’s home. But Devaki blushes when we mention it to her. “My husband and school friends put it up, even though I was not for it. Participating inMasterChef Tamiland winning the inaugural season feels like a dream to me; I haven’t woken up yet!” laughs Devaki. Filmed in Bengaluru and telecast by Sun TV, MasterChef India - Tamil was hosted by actor Vijay Sethupathi. Professional chefs Harish Rao, Aarthi Sampath and Koushik S were the judges. There is no doubt Devaki has achieved far more than what she had initially hoped for: besides winning the title and trophy, she has also got the coveted MasterChef gold-trimmed coat, and a cash prize of Rs. 25 lakh. After clearing two audition rounds in Madurai, Devaki was among the 12 shortlisted contestants who headed to Bengaluru, where a further 12 people joined the competition. Interacting with the charismatic host was a highlight. “Vijay Sethupathi is so down-to-earth; when we were waiting for the chefs to evaluate our work with knots in our stomachs, he would ease the tension with light-hearted banter,” she recalls. By contrast, she says, the judges were strict. “We could talk only about the food we had cooked.” Devaki presented recipes that capitalised on a continental flavour with a southern Indian twist. Whether arancini (fried Italian rice balls stuffed with cheese) made with karuvepillai sadam , or dianthus poothrekelu , a floral take on the papery Andhra rice batter dessert served up with white chocolate, her yen for fusion cuisine stood out. In the finale, Mayajalam, an iced lemon cream quennelle with a paruthi paal (cottonseed extract) mousse filling won over the judges, with its sweet and tart flavours. Devaki hopes to secure a portion of her prize money for her son’s future, and also expand her bakery business.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/making-of-a-masterchef/article37695051.ece
26 November 2021||November 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Have a pawsome new year||Surya looks majestic, lying down with his paws touching each other, his white-furred neck erect, and his striking green eyes focussed, as if he is looking ahead to something. It is an apt cover image for EveryLife 2022, Humane Animal Society’s (HAS) annual charity calendar. Surya came to HAS as a wounded, tiny kitten. One of his legs had to be amputated. “We put him up for adoption. But nobody adopted him. So, he ended up being one of our resident cats,” says Mini Vasudevan, HAS co-founder. Despite the loss of a limb, Surya is a sprightly cat, who is also very comfortable around the dogs. Surya is one of 20 rescued animals featured in the HAS calendar. “Every month has a special story. It is as if the animal says what it is feeling. We have tried to personify them,” adds Mini. June, for instance, features Cookie, a brown, three-limbed mongrel. “She had met with an accident and one of her limbs was necrosed. We didn’t think she would survive the night,” recalls Mini, “But a day after the surgery to remove the injured limb, she started improving. She probably doesn’t know she has lost a leg. Because she’s completely poised and looks majestic. She inspires us because she has survived a really bad situation.” Cookie’s caption reads, “I am an impossibility made possible. I am disbelief turned true. I am all that you can make me be.” The lines are by Shobhana Kumar, a poet and the founder of NGO Small Differences. Last year was not great for stray cats and dogs in Coimbatore, says Mini. “Abandonment, accidents, and diseases increased. Adoption had gone up as well. But with people returning to their offices, we need to see if some of the adopted animals will be abandoned again. We used to get more volunteers. But now everyone has become busy again.” There are about 200 rescued animals with HAS. About 15 to 25 animals get adopted each month, says Mini. “There are people who adopt a differently-abled dog or cat. So, we have a lot of people who have come forward to care for these animals.” Mini wishes to see more such people next year.

26 November 2021||November 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Why ‘Bombe Helitaithe ’ is trending||The song ‘Bombe Helitaithe’ was originally written by Santosh Anand for his directorial venture Rajakumara , featuring late Kannada actor Puneeth Rajkumar and was composed by V Harikrishna, and sung by Vijay Prakash. The lyrics seem prophetic and have become synonymous as a tribute to him. Fans across the border in Pakistan are also singing the song and posting it on their social media platforms. Excerpts from a chat with the singer:   Your song for Puneeth Rajkumar has now gone viral. Your thoughts?   It was not long ago that Appu (Puneeth) and I shared the stage and sang it together as a tribute to his father, Dr Rajkumar, who we called Annavaru . Not even in my wildest dreams did I imagine I would be singing this song as a tribute for Appu.  The song has become synonymous as a tribute to Puneeth ...   True, it has become a tribute to Appu, who lived his life to the full in a short span of 46 years. What one man could not do in 100 years, Appu has done it all in his short life — as a philanthropist and actor. It is only now that we realise the magnitude of the good work he has done. With a heavy heart, I dedicate the song to Appu as well.    What has changed about the song?   Till now, it was just a song and now, it has become a description of the life that he lived. The song has travelled across borders and has become an emotion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/why-bombe-helitaithe-is-trending/article37695041.ece

26 November 2021||November 26 2021 00:00 IST,||When walls have eyes, ears, and voices||“That’s the keerai lady,” laughs Shakeela Begum, pausing in front of Block 10 of the Tamil Nadu Urban Habitat Development Board at Ukkadam. She is on her way to the grocery store and has stopped to chat with the artists. The building is the canvas for Trespassers, a Kerala-based artists collective. They have been invited to work at Ukkadam ‘art district’, a public art initiative by St+art India Foundation, in association with Asian Paints and Coimbatore City Municipal Corporation. Shakeela looks at the building with growing familiarity. Painted on it are her friends and neighbours: the wingless parrot seated on a blue plastic drum; the lady in a yellow dupatta buying vegetables from a grocery shop; a brown and white tabby cat that lounges on a sunshade; a goat that gingerly makes its way up a staircase…Artists Jinil Manikandan, Arjun Gopi, Pranav Prabhakaran, and Sijoy Paulose from Trespassers, have specifically picked people, animals, and objects that form the imagery of the locality as their subjects. The artists are wrapping up their work as you read this, and have been painting on Block 10 from the beginning of this month. “We spent the first four days once we arrived, simply walking around and getting to know the place and the people,” says 26-year-old Jinil. This was where it all began: conversations with the residents, glimpses into their houses, games with little boys and puppies that followed them around…they are all there on the wall in some form. Jinil says that they were particularly taken in by what people said about the pandemic lockdowns. “They said it was a jolly time,” he smiles, adding, “These are small one-bedroom houses and it is impossible to maintain physical distancing. The entire building was in a quarantine bubble. They were together the whole time when the lockdowns were imposed.” Their work is, in fact, a scene from one such day. “This was when everyday objects that were lying around the house took up new significance; people started noticing the surroundings they took for granted all along,” points out Jinil. Just then, his fellow-artist Pranav, hops off the scaffolding on which he was painting from. A streak of white paint on his cheek, Pranav talks about the wingless parrot that is featured. “It just sits on the drum all day,” he says, pointing to the painting. The team worked without a plan. “We incorporated new characters as and when we saw them,” explains Pranav. The artists worked with over 50 children in the locality to paint a wall at a park nearby as part of the community engagement activities of the project. Which explains why they are always surrounded by a gaggle of little boys, who comment on every new character that takes shape. This is what Trespassers want: their philosophy is to engage with regular people through their art. “We want to take art out of the confines of the gallery space that only an elite few have access to,” says Jinil. The 12-member collective was formed two years ago, and are from various parts of Kerala. They are all alumni of Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady in Ernakulam and have done several public art projects. “People who frequent a particular street will have subconsciously registered each object it is made of,” says Jinil. “If say, one of our art works comes up on a building there, it will eventually become an everyday object they encounter — we will have hence ‘trespassed’ on their visual memory even without them realising it,” he adds, interpreting their collective’s name. Does it irk that their art will eventually fade with time, dust, and sun? “Not one bit,” says Jinil. “This is part of the process. We stop becoming artists the moment our work is done,” he explains. “We are then merely spectators. We look at it with no idea of how it will eventually end up.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/when-walls-have-eyes-ears-and-voices/article37695066.ece

For, Sonu Nigam is well known for his non-filmi musical outings in the Nineties. What gave him the confidence back then? “I realised that a lot of art could be created beyond it through independent projects. I was open to trying newer things.” It was probably that urge to break boundaries that led Sonu to the South. He is no stranger to Tamil music, having debuted with AR Rahman’s ‘Varayo Thozhi’ from Jeans (1998) and also subsequently singing for GV Prakash and many other music composers. “I am lucky to have got the opportunity to work with the likes of Ilaiyaraaja and AR Rahman,” he says. “Late singer SPB was one of my special musical gurus; in fact, I sang ‘Aasman Kehta Hai Rab Se’ ( Mast ) keeping his delivery style in mind.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/for-the-record/article37695463.ece

Scheduled to release in theatres on December 10, Gamanam stars Shriya Saran, Shiva Kandukuri, Priyanka Jawalkar, Suhas, Charuhasan and Nithya Menen (in a cameo). The anthology film, produced by cinematographer Gnana Shekhar VS along with Venki Pushadapu and Ramesh Karutoori, explores how characters in three stories cope with a deluge following torrential downpour. Sujana reminisces, “A few years ago when I was studying at National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), we used to visit a nearby waterbody and take photographs. Later we noticed the area being turned into a construction site. Each year when there’s flooding in Hyderabad or Chennai, we read about how it is a man-made disaster, as waterbodies get encroached in the name of urban development. That made me write Gamanam .”   Gamanam was filmed in 2019 and the post production happened during the pandemic. The producers were keen on a theatrical release: “I am grateful for their faith in the project,” says Sujana. Unhinged approach Shriya plays Kamala, a young hearing-impaired mother who has to rough it out on her own. Shiva Kandukuri is an aspiring cricketer supported by Priyanka Jawalkar. Charuhasan agreed to play a crucial role and Sujana recalls how the veteran actor, now in his 90s, was game to film as heavy rains pelted down on him. She also lavishes praise on the efforts of Priyanka Jawalkar, Shiva Kandukuri and the other actors in the ensemble cast, including two boys who were roped in to play street children. Their scenes in the trailer might remind one of the Tamil film Kaaka Muttai , where street kids yearn for an expensive treat, but Sujana asserts that the similarities end there. Maestro’s music The icing on the cake was getting Ilaiyaraaja to compose the music: “He said he does not take up a project if he does not like the story. I had narrated most of the story but even before I could complete it, he stood up and asked one of the team members to take a photograph of us. He remarked, ‘we are doing the film’. I was overjoyed.” Later, watching the rough cut of the film, Ilaiyaaraja would remark that the film mirrors life-like situations and that he could not budge from his seat while watching the second half: “This was the biggest compliment for me.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/director-sujana-rao-on-gamanam-ilaiyaraajas-appreciation-was-the-best-compliment/article37695465.ece

26 November 2021||November 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Fire and snow||“Yipee, this is like a snowfall! I wonder where it’s coming from,” cried 11-year-old Shiv, trying to catch the fluffs of silky cotton that were falling on his head and all around the park, as he waited for his friends to join him in a game of cricket. “It’s all coming from this Red Silk Cotton Tree,” said a voice behind him. It was Dayal, the park’s old caretaker. Shiv looked up at the tree at which Dayal was pointing. It had an armour of prickly bark, as if it didn’t like anyone climbing it. But the canopy was festooned with several brown pods, many of which had split open waiting for the breeze to launch their seeds along with generous amounts of cotton. “Now, look at this,” said Dayal, pointing to the ground. Shiv was flummoxed to see scores of little red-and-black bugs, jostling to get at the seeds. “These Red Silk Cotton Bugs want to suck the oil from the seeds. It makes them strong,” said Dayal. “This way, the seeds’ hard outer coat softens, making it easier for them to germinate into new trees.” “I suppose these bugs won’t mind if I take one seed to grow a red silk cotton tree outside my house?” said Shiv. “Then, I can enjoy the snowfall of cotton every year.” Disappointed That day, Shiv hurried home after his game. He planted the little seed in a secluded corner of his mother’s flowerbed. Each day, he would check to see if his seed had grown. But nothing seemed to happen even though the flowerbed was watered every day. Then came the rains. On one wet day that Shiv saw, to his great joy, that his seed had grown into a two-feet high sapling. It had sprouted leaves, each of which had five leaflets, and the stem had baby prickles. The tree grew, and, by the end of the monsoon, it looked tall and handsome. Sadly, once the monsoon was over and it became hot and sunny, the tree began shedding its dark green leaves. In no time it had turned bare, with not a speck of green. Shiv would sit next to it and speak to it, trying his best to revive it, but to no avail. One day, his mother set out to clear the weeds and all the shrubbery that had grown in their garden during the rains. She went about swishing the scythe at the grass and shrubbery. Shiv arrived just as she was about to slice off his tree. “Stop!” he cried. “Don’t cut my tree.” “But it is dead; it doesn’t have a single leaf on it,” his mother said. “It might revive next monsoon, please let it be,” Shiv pleaded. “Very well, as you wish.” Bursting with life Shiv didn’t have to wait till the next monsoon season. Within a fortnight, the tree began to put out new green shoots. Soon, its branches waved welcoming all with its green leaves. A few months later, Shiv’s special tree came into its own. The canopy was covered with large bright red bell-shaped flowers loaded with nectar. Now Shiv was not the tree’s only companion. It drew a host of visitors: buzzing bees, fluttering butterflies, noisy drongos, squawking parakeets... all seemed to be partying every day. One of its branches was overgrown with an epiphyte — mistletoe, the narrow-tubed crimson flowers which invited tiny flower-peckers and sunbirds. Soon, the flowers turned into cotton-filled pods, completing its circle of life. Shiv and his friends enjoyed playing with the balls of cotton, pretending it was snow, and gazing endlessly at the armies of Red Silk Cotton bugs that appeared again, as if from nowhere.  “It’s all coming from this Red Silk Cotton Tree,” said a voice behind him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/fire-and-snow/article37695760.ece

After his father’s attitude changed, Vineet would not be separated from the mantra. He carried the paper in his pocket to school. Even when he visited the mall or played with his friends, the paper stayed with him. At the mall, he was greeted with “You are our seventh customer and, as it’s our seventh anniversary, we want to gift this video game to to you!” The shop owner handed Vineet the video game that every boy was yearning for. He was delighted and took the gift, as his friend looked on wistfully. Vineet carried the paper everywhere; whether at home or in school. Teachers forgot to scold him for shoddy assignments or incomplete homework. “Vineet will be the class prefect for this academic year,” the class teacher announced. Everyone was shocked! So was Vineet. Vineet went up to her desk, and his teacher pinned the prefect badge to his collar. All day long, Vineet floated on Cloud Nine. At night, when he showed his family the prefect badge, his mom burst into tears. “I’m so proud of you Vineet,” his dad smiled. “I’ll give your mobile phone and laptop back after dinner.” Vineet grinned. Everyone’s favourite Vineet tried the power of his mantra on Mrs. Sen. Her attitude towards him changed drastically. He became her favourite boy in the neighbourhood. “Such a sweet boy,” she ruffled his hair whenever she met him in their lane. It was Friday, the day students were to submit their Science assignment. Vineet had played all through the weekend spending very little time on his assignment. While submitting his assignment Vineet stared at the teacher and chanted the mantra a few times. “Vineet,” the Biology teacher said half an hour later. “Your assignment is the best.” Vineet was thrilled. He repeated the mantra five more times. “I’m nominating your name to represent our school for the Junior School Biology Exhibition in Chennai next week.” He gasped! This was far better than he had expected.  To be continued...

He wanted to read the obit of his brother Ludvig. He saw the headline and frowned. Le Marchand de la mort est mort — The merchant of death is dead . Quickly, he read it through. To his utter dismay, he found that he was reading his own obituary, not his brother’s. A quiet, reclusive man, he immediately set about thinking how he could change his image for posterity. He hit upon an idea that forever ensured his memory as humanitarian and philanthropist. Awarding the best On November 27, 1895, Alfred signed his last will. When he died in 1896, his family and friends were shocked when they discovered that a bulk of his vast fortune was left in trust to establish what came to be the most highly regarded of international awards: the Nobel Prizes in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology and Literature. His friendship with Austrian pacifist, Bertha von Suttner, inspired him to establish a prize for Peace. Born on October 21, 1833, Alfred Nobel was an intellectually curious child. In 1837, his father Immanuel took his family to St. Petersburg, Russia. Alfred went to Paris to study Chemistry and later moved to the U.S. He returned to St. Petersburg in 1852 and worked in his father’s factory, making military equipment during the Crimean War. In 1862, he built a small factory to manufacture nitroglycerin and researched a safe way to control the detonation, which at that time was undependable. By 1865, he had invented an improved detonator called a blasting cap, which was a forerunner to the modern use of high explosives. His second important invention was the dynamite in 1867. By the 1880s he had built a network of factories throughout Europe to manufacture dynamite. Besides explosives, he had several other inventions, like artificial silk and leather, to his credit. In death, Alfred Nobel remains a man of contradictions. A brilliant, lonely man with incisive wit, an idealist, and inventor of some of the most powerful explosives used in warfare, he established the world’s most prestigious prizes for intellectual services rendered to humanity.

26 November 2021||November 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Let the world know how curious you are.||How do we get pimples?  Pimples are caused by a medical condition called Acne. We have very fine hair on our face, which you can hardly see. At the base of each hair is the follicle from which it springs. In oily skin, the follicle is blocked by excess oil. Sometimes dead skin cells also clog it. This causes various forms of acne like whiteheads, blackheads and pimples. Often, acne sets in during the teenage years but it can affect any age group. Severe cases can cause scarring. There are treatments available and the earlier they are begun, the better it is.  Whydoes a lizard’s tail jump when cut off accidentally?  Lizards have what is called a ‘fracture plane’ in their tails. This means that any stress on this point will cause the muscles to move away from each other and the tail drops off. But, the nerves in the severed part are still communicating with each other. Therefore, the cut-off portion continues to jump around and move, sometimes for up to half an hour. This tends to distract the hunter and the lizard manages to escape.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/let-the-world-know-how-curious-you-are/article37695720.ece

A group of Swiss, Spanish, German and English footballers met on November 29 that year, marking its beginning. 2 FC Barcelona, which is based out of central Catalonia, follows the ‘socio’ system of ownership, meaning it is owned by its registered members and supporters. 3 It’s motto is Més que un club ,  meaning ‘More than a club’ — a reflection of the club being a symbol of Catalan culture and polticial ideology. 4 When La Liga, the top Spanish football league, was formed in 1929, FC Barcelona won the inaugural season. 5 It is the only European club to have won a treble — La Liga, the Copa Del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League — all in one season, twice. 6 Some of its famous players included Johan Cruyff, Diego Maradona, Ronaldinho, Xavi, and Lionel Messi. 7 Its biggest rival is Real Madrid. Games between the two teams are referred to as El Clásico (“The Classic”) because the two sides symbolise the ongoing political rift between Catalonia and Spain. 8 FC Barcelona is the fourth-most valuable sports team in the world, and the world’s richest football club in terms of revenue. 9 Its homeground is the Camp Nou amphitheatre, opened in 1957.

Mr. Sidhu once again questioned the State Government over the steps taken for ensuring justice in desecration cases. “If the Punjab Government does not make [STF] report public, then I will proceed on fast unto death,” he said, taking on his own Government while addressing a gathering in Moga’s Baghapurana. “Thousands of youth got destroyed due to drugs, mothers lost their sons. There is no court order which bars making the report public. Who stops you from making the report public. We need to know why the previous Chief Minister sat on this report,” Mr. Sidhu asked. On cases related to the desecration of a religious text in 2015, he said, “I am again seeking justice for sacrilege.” The Congress leader had recently demanded that the report of the Special Task Force on the drug menace be made public and a time-bound probe be initiated to catch the ‘big fish responsible for narco-terrorism’. On the STF report, Mr. Sidhu had said, “Hon’ble HC supplied a copy of STF report on drugs to the Government. But instead of proceeding as per law, we are sitting on the STF report since February 2018. Even we have failed to extradite the other accused in this multi-crore drugs case. The solution is to catch and punish the big fish.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/make-stf-report-on-drug-menace-public-sidhu/article37695486.ece
26 November 2021||Mumbai,||Shakti Mills gang rape: Bombay HC commutes death penalty of three||The Bombay High Court on Thursday commuted to life sentence the death penalty awarded to three convicts in the gangrape of a 22-year-old photojournalist inside the defunct Shakti Mills compound in central Mumbai in 2013. The judges said they “deserve imprisonment for life to repent the offence committed by them as death puts an end to the concept of repentance”. Terming rape as a “serious blow to the supreme honour and dignity of a woman”, the court said the convicts “do not deserve to assimilate with the society, as it would be difficult to survive in a society of such men who look upon women with derision, depravity, contempt and objects of desire”. A Division Bench of Justices Sadhana Jadhav and Prithviraj Chavan refused to confirm the death penalty awarded to Vijay Jadhav, Mohammad Qasim Bengali Shaikh and Mohammad Ansari, and commuted their sentence to life in prison for the remainder of their lives. The judgment comes seven years after a trial court in Mumbai awarded the death sentence to them. The High Court noted that although the offence was “barbaric and heinous”, it cannot be said at the threshold that the convicts deserve only death penalty and nothing less than that. “A sentence of death is irrevocable and therefore, the basic principle in sentencing policy would be life imprisonment as a rule and death penalty as an exception,” the court said. The Bench in its order noted that as a constitutional court it would not be proper on its part to “eliminate or extinguish the flame of the life of the convicts without following due procedure established by law”. “We cannot allow our emotions to outweigh the principles of criminal jurisprudence and the procedural mandate of the statute...We are of the opinion that the convicts deserve the punishment of rigorous imprisonment for life that is the whole of the remainder of their natural life in order to repent for the offence committed by them,” the judgment said. “The accused do not deserve any leniency, empathy or sympathy. Everyday the rising sun would remind them of the barbaric acts committed by them and the night would lay them with a heavy heart filled with guilty and remorse,” the judgment said.  ‘No parole, furlough’ The court said that the convicts shall not be entitled for remission, furlough or parole as they cannot be allowed to assimilate in the society and as there is no scope for reformation. “The convicts do not deserve to assimilate with the society, as it would be difficult to survive in a society of such men who look upon women with derision, depravity, contempt and objects of desire,” the court said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/shakti-mills-gang-rape-bombay-hc-commutes-death-penalty-of-three/article37695482.ece
26 November 2021||Pune,||MSRTC strike on, staff ignore State Govt.’s offer to hike pay||A day after the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government announced a pay hike in a bid to end the indefinite strike by the staffers of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC), the latter continued to remained firm on their chief demand of seeking to be treated as government employees while demanding the merger of the cash-strapped MSRTC with the State government. Many MSRTC workers refused to budge from Mumbai’s Azad Maidan despite Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders Gopichand Padalkar and Sadabhau Khot, who have been leading the Mumbai agitation, stating they were ending the strike for the time being. However, several MSRTC staffers, expressing their anguish at the duo’s withdrawal dubbed Mr. Khot and Mr. Padalkar’s decision as a ‘betrayal’ of the workers’ interests while accusing them of having ‘sold out’ to the State government. However, both BJP leaders, who were responsible for keeping the issue on the boil in Mumbai, said they had not betrayed anyone and that there would always stand by the workers through thick and thin. “We are temporarily withdrawing our agitation. Whether the workers wish to withdraw it or not depends on the collective decision of all MSRTC staffers across the State…It is their right and we are with them. While our demand, too, has always been merger of the MSRTC, the State government has taken two steps forward and we were of the opinion that the workers, too, ought to consolidate their victory until the issue of the merger was resolved,” Mr. Padalkar said.  Govt. warns of action Meanwhile, State Transport Minister Anil Parab said that the MSRTC would give time till Friday morning for all agitators to resume duties, else those staffers who continued to strike would face stern action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/msrtc-strike-on-staff-ignore-state-govts-offer-to-hike-pay/article37695478.ece
26 November 2021||New Delhi,||If you don’t agree with the author, don’t read the book: High Court||The Delhi High Court on Thursday rejected a petition to stop the circulation, sale, purchase and publication of Congress leader Salman Khurshid’s new book Sunrise over Ayodhaya: Nationhood In Our Times in which he has allegedly compared ‘Hindutva’ to radical terrorist groups such as ISIS and Boko Haram. Justice Yashwant Verma said, “What can we do if people are feeling this. If they didn’t like the passage, they can skip the chapter. They could have shut their eyes if they are feeling hurt”. Stirring emotions The High Court was hearing a petition by advocate Vineet Jindal who claimed that the statement published in the book is “not only instigating and provoking statement but also stirring enraged emotions among the Hindu religion followers”. “If you don’t agree with the author, don’t read it. Ask people not to buy the book or read it. Please tell people the book is badly authored, read something better,” Justice Verma said, while refusing to entertain the public interest petition. In the petition, Mr. Jindal reproduced the ‘controversial’ paragraph in the book which reads: “Sanatan dharma and classical Hinduism known to sages and saints was being pushed aside by a robust version of Hindutva, by all standards a political version similar to jihadist Islam of groups liks ISIS and Boko Haram of recent years”. “This statement shows his [Mr. Khurshid] intent of enmity between different groups on the grounds of religion which is against the ideology of a secular democratic country like ours,” Mr. Jindal said in his plea. ‘Threatens peace’ Mr. Jindal further argued that Mr. Khurshid being an MP and former Law Minister is a public figure, having a larger influence on public. “The statement is agitating the Hindu community and also threatens the security, peace and harmony of our nation and disrupt public order,” he said. Mr. Jindal argued that freedom of expression is not absolute and carries with it special duties and responsibilities which may be subject to certain restrictions provided by law.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/if-you-dont-agree-with-the-author-dont-read-the-book-high-court/article37695475.ece
26 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Gujarat holds out incentives to attract investors to Dholera||Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel is considering granting special incentives to attract investors to Dholera, being touted by the State as the country’s largest greenfield special investment region. In the national Capital to announce the tenth edition of the Vibrant Gujarat investor summit in January 2022, Mr. Patel said the State expected some of the world’s largest companies to attend the summit, which had evolved into “a global platform” from the time it was conceptualised by then Chief Minister Narendra Modi in 2003. “This summit will be the biggest event after the pandemic and different from all the earlier such meets held even before the pandemic,” said Rajiv Kumar Gupta, Additional Chief Secretary of Gujarat, noting that roadshows were being held across the country and in several locations in the U.S., Europe and the Far East. Prime Minister Narendra Modi would be in Gandhinagar on January 10 to inaugurate the meet, which had fructified into 28,360 memorandums of understanding being signed with investors at its last iteration in 2019. Mr. Gupta said the State had recently amended its industrial policy to allow companies to lease land for 50 years at just 6% of the prevailing market rate, instead of going for outright purchase of land. “A relocation subsidy is also being offered for industries moving to the State from other locations and the CM himself is evaluating a new incentive policy for investments in Dholera, which is spread over 900 square kilometres with great connectivity infrastructure,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/gujarat-holds-out-incentives-to-attract-investors-to-dholera/article37695490.ece
26 November 2021||Mumbai,||Maharashtra schools to reopen for primary classes||Days after teacher and parent organisations urged the State Government to restart primary schools in the State, Maharashtra Cabinet on Thursday cleared the decision to reopen physical classes for students studying of Class 1 to 4 from December 1. State Education Minister Varsha Gaikwad said, “The decision to reopen primary schools has been cleared by the State Cabinet. Those who are studying in Class 1 and 2 have never seen the face of the school. They haven’t been in a classroom and been taught directly by a teacher. For them, everything will be new when they enter the class. We will try to ensure that this new experience will be happy and healthy for them.” ‘Classes from Dec. 1’ Ms. Gaikwad said that her department had sent the proposal to restart schools after holding rounds of discussion with the Chief Minister, chief secretary, health department, pediatric task force and others. “We had said that the department would require at least a week to prepare for the classes. Based on that December 1 is decided as a date to restart primary classes,” she said. ‘Norms will be followed’ Reiterating what teacher organisations had been claiming that it was important for students to make a comeback in offline education system, she said the department will be holding discussions with parents and teachers before starting classes. “All COVID guidelines and health norms will be followed,” she assured. Several teacher organisations have been demanding the reopening of schools pointing out severe lack of quality in online education, especially in rural areas due to lack of internet connectivity and unavailability of tools. Health Minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday had said that the health department has given the go ahead for reopening of primary classes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/maharashtra-schools-to-reopen-for-primary-classes/article37695479.ece

26 November 2021||Kolkata,||NAAC team visit triggers anxiety in Visva-Bharati||Visva-Bharati is holding its breath at the moment as a team appointed by the NAAC, or National Assessment and Accreditation Council, is currently visiting the university for assessing the quality of its education. The NAAC assesses and accredits higher education institutions every five years and during the last assessment, the Santiniketan-based Visva-Bharati had narrowly missed the A grade. On a four-point scale, a minimum score of 3 is required to be rated A, whereas the university had scored 2.82. “I think all of us, irrespective of who is in support of or against the Vice-Chancellor, are very eager that we impress the visiting team because the NAAC rating decides bringing of projects to the university, the kind of facilities that should be set up here, and the awards people receive,” a senior teacher told The Hindu , asking not to be named. “Last time, in 2015, differences between the then Vice-Chancellor and some members of the faculty had reflected on the rating. I think this time everybody understands that a poor rating will only impact the future of the university and not that of the V-C,” the teacher said. But dissent is already being conveyed to the visiting team. A group from the university has already written anonymously to the head of the team with a list of complaints against Prof. Bidyut Chakrabarty, the current V-C. “Vice-Chancellor, Visva-Bharati has violated the Government directive to open up the university and hostels and to start offline classes at all levels of graduation and post-graduation,” the note, widely being circulated on social media, said. According to the students, Central universities, such as Visva-Bharati, are bound to follow the orders of respective State Governments in this regard. “There are many issues of students which the Vice-Chancellor did not address at all. He never ever met students. It is a farce to arrange the NAAC visit without any students on the campus,” the note further said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/naac-team-visit-triggers-anxiety-in-visva-bharati/article37695480.ece
