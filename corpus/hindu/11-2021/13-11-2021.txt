13 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Negotiators at COP26 brainstorm over draft||The 2022 edition of the Conference of Parties, or the 27th COP, will take place at Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt and the 28th edition in 2023 will be held in the UAE, the Council decided even as a final agreement to conclude COP26 proved elusive until the time of going to press. Even as the ongoing COP26 in Glasgow was reaching its conclusion on Friday evening in Glasgow, negotiators from 200 countries continued to be in discussions polishing a draft agreement that has been ready since Wednesday. For a final agreement, all countries have to agree to every word in the text agreement, drafted by the team of COP president Alok Sharma. This text is a synthesis of all the discussions since November 1 when the COP26 began. The COP26 will not unveil a treaty as in 2015 when the Paris Agreement came into being but is expected to guide implementation of the Paris Agreement, that exhorted countries to take steps to keep temperatures from rising beyond 2 degrees Celsius by the turn of the century and “pursue efforts to keep it” to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Negotiators at Glasgow started ambitiously keeping the 1.5 degrees Celsius target but several outstanding issues and disagreements — most prominently on climate finance — have proved to be stumbling blocks. Developing countries such as India and China are pushing for formal acknowledgement from the West that they have not delivered on past promises of providing $100 billion annually until 2020. Developed countries have promised to deliver on this by 2023-24 but India and several other low-income and developing countries have demanded financing post 2025 and also funds for the loss and damage that has already been incurred in their countries due to climate catastrophes. Though much of the text is ready, bones of contention are usually single verbs that open paragraphs of the draft text: “Urges,” “Considers”, “Notes” as each of them, in UN climatespeak denote specific degrees of commitment. For instance, para 48 of the text currently says: “(The Presidency) Urges developed country Parties to fully deliver on the USD 100 billion goal urgently and through to 2025 and emphasises the importance of transparency in the implementation of their pledges.” This is considered the highest level endorsement of developing countries’ position that enough hasn’t been done in the past by developed countries to keep promises. India has demanded a trillion dollars over the next decade from developed countries to adapt to and mitigate the challenges from global warming and has kept this as a condition for delivering on climate commitments made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/amid-debates-final-deal-eludes-cop26/article37466961.ece
13 November 2021||Belagavi,||Work taken up on Halaga-Machche Bypass Road, a day after tension||A day after farmers staged a protest against land acquisition on the outskirts of Belagavi, officers began work on the Halaga-Machche Bypass Road on Friday. A group of farmers, however, continued to be on protest at a distance from the worksite. A team of officers, including Deputy Commissioner M.G. Hiremath, Deputy Commissioner of Police Vikram Amathe and some engineers from the State Public Works Department and the National Highways Authority of India, visited the worksite. Mr. Hiremath said that land acquisition was carried out as per the provisions of law. Over 800 farmers have received a compensation of Rs. 25 crore, in all. The State Government has also assured them of looking into their demands for higher compensation. “We are starting work as per the orders of the State Government,” he said. He said that the district administration officers are trying to convince the farmers not to stage protest and are sharing all relevant data with them, to clarify their doubts. Some farmers have said that their holdings are small and that they will like a land-for-land deal and not money as compensation. “We have communicated their demands to the State Government which will consider such demands,” he said. NHAI officers denied the charge that the officers have deliberately erred to deprive some farmers of compensation or to drop out some influential farmers from the list of land losers. That there have been two surveys, one different from the other, is far from truth. There is no difference between the two surveys. There has been no injustice meted out to anyone, an NHAI officer said. On Thursday, farmers strongly opposed the construction of the road saying that they suffered in the land acquisition process. While a farmer tried to immolate himself, the police had to take others into custody to clear the area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/work-taken-up-on-halaga-machche-bypass-road-a-day-after-tension/article37467244.ece
13 November 2021||MYSURU,||Special exhibiton from next week||After two successive years of low-key Dasara during which the Dasara exhibition could not be held, the Doddakere Maidan in front of Mysuru palace is all set to host a two-month-long special exhibition from next week. It will feature stalls of handloom, handicrafts, hosiery, and other items, besides a food court and an amusement park and comes almost a month after the conclusion of this year’s Dasara festival. Karnataka Exhibition Authority (KEA) chairman Hemanth Kumar told The Hindu that the authority decided to hold the show after losing revenue for two consecutive years. “We have not been able to hold the exhibition since 2019 Dasara due to COVID-19 restrictions on crowds. We need funds to bear the routine expenditure. We also received requests from traders to hold the exhibition and facilitate their business that had been seriously hit,” he said, adding that the authority had given the contract for the exhibition to a Bengaluru-based firm. The entry ticket is Rs. 30 for adults and Rs. 20 for children, he said and added that the parking fee would be minimal. Work was under full swing at the Doddakere Maidan premises on Friday. “Around 96 out of the 142 stalls in ‘A’ block have been set up. We will announce the date of the start of the exhibition when all the stalls are ready to open,” Mr. Kumar said, recalling that Dasara exhibitions were routinely inaugurated sans stalls. “This time, we want to inaugurate the exhibition only when at least 90 per cent of the stalls are ready and the visitors are not disappointed when they come.” “We may open from next Friday. But a final decision will be taken in four days’ time,” he said. Around 40 stalls were expected to come up in the food court area. The amusement park section would feature a variety of rides and entertainment avenues for the young. The fixtures for the amusement park, which are being transported from different places in Tamil Nadu, will soon be in place. The KEA was also planning to organise cultural programmes at the B.V. Karanth Ranga Mandira on the Doddakere Maidan premises.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/special-exhibiton-from-next-week/article37467350.ece
13 November 2021||HYDERABAD,||TRS raises voice against Centre, demands Rabi paddy purchase||The ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) has taken to streets nearly after a year of raising its voice against the BJP-led Union government, this time demanding the latter to continue purchase of boiled rice produced in the Rabi season in the State. As part of the protests held in about 100 Assembly constituencies across the State and also in Hyderabad, the TRS leaders have also raised voice against the provisions of new farm laws, Electricity Bill and demanding stopping of discrimination between States in the matter of paddy/rice procurement, sanction of projects and funds. All the ministers, legislators and members of Parliament participated in the dharnas staged in Assembly constituency headquarters in districts and at Indira Park Dharna Chowk in the City. The protests were staged on highways, in front of the collectorates, revenue divisional offices, tahsildars’ offices and other places. Farmers along with TRS activists, leaders, workers and supporters mobilised in large numbers in support of the demand to the Centre to continue procurement of boiled rice produced in the Rabi season. ‘Creating confusion’ Speaking at Sircilla, TRS working president and Minister K.T. Rama Rao said there were queues for seed, fertilizer and protests for adequate power supply for raising crops before Telangana was formed. He explained that the State government had made a small beginning to divert farmers towards alternative crops by educating them and explaining about the difficulties in procurement. A section of farmers had agreed to go for other crops this Rabi season, but BJP State leaders were creating confusion among farmers by asking them to cultivate paddy only and that they (BJP) would make the State government buy it. At Siddipet, Minister T. Harish Rao said they had protested against low-voltage issue, burning out of motor pump-sets due to voltage fluctuation, burn out of transformers, supply of sufficient power to raise crops during day-time and for adequate supply of fertilizers in the past. Low grade rice He stated that production of raw rice was not possible in the State due to the extreme hot weather conditions during the season allowing production of only boiled rice. In case the paddy produced in Rabi was processed (milled) without steaming, the percentage of broken rice would be very high up to 50%, making it completely uneconomical. Stating that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would respond to tweets swiftly, Mr. Harish Rao asked the farming community to tweet to PM in large numbers requesting purchase of boiled rice produced in the Rabi season or allow export of such rice by millers as a solution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/trs-raises-voice-against-centre/article37467452.ece
13 November 2021||CHENNAI,||Chennai rain 5 times above normal||Chennai received nearly five-and-a-half times more than normal rainfall in November over the past six days. S. Balachandran, Deputy Director General of Meteorology, Chennai, said the city has received 46 cm of rainfall between November 7 and November 12. This is nearly 491% more than the normal quota of 8 cm in the city. Similarly, the State recorded an overall rainfall of 10 cm during the recent rainspell triggered by the depression, which is 142% excess of the normal for the week. After over three days of relentless rain, the city had a welcome break on Friday. However, while Thursday’s depression had weakened into a low pressure area over north interior Tamil Nadu and neighbourhood, the Meteorological department said another fresh low pressure area is likely to form over south Andaman sea by Saturday. It may intensify into a depression over east-central and adjoining southeast Bay of Bengal on November 15. On the fresh weather system likely to gain strength, Mr. Balachandran said: “The region where it would have its impact is being monitored. It would depend on the movement and intensification of the weather system.” This weekend, rain bands may largely shift to other districts as a trough runs from coastal Andhra Pradesh to Comorin area across Rayalaseema and interior T.N. Heavy rain is possible in isolated places over 18 districts such as Kanniyakumari, Vellore, Coimbatore, Madurai and Namakkal on Saturday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/chennai-rain-5-times-above-normal/article37466953.ece
13 November 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||Aided status: managements given fresh chance to exercise option, says Minister||Amidst protests by students and student organisations, the government has asked District Collectors to seek a fresh mandate from the managements of aided educational institutions in the State on the merger issue. “There is no coercion or pressure. We are doing a repeat of the past exercise, and if a management wants to review its earlier decision and even if the teachers of that particular school have been posted, we are ready to send them back,” insisted Education Minister A. Suresh. Mr. Suresh said the managements had four options: They could surrender only teacher posts and run as unaided private institutions, surrender both, posts and assets and the government would run them, not part with their assets and give their institution on lease for which the government would pay the rent and run them and under fourth option, they could run their institutions without giving their staff and assets giving up their grant-in-aid status.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/aided-status-managements-given-fresh-chance-to-exercise-option-says-minister/article37466951.ece
13 November 2021||KOLLAM,||Repeated flash floods worry east Kollam||Repeated landslip and flash floods during the last few days have become a cause of major concern for the residents of eastern Kollam. Though no casualty has been reported, a series of landslips hit multiple locations on Thursday causing widespread damage to crops and property. Arayankavu panchayat witnessed the first landslip on October 28 and intense rain triggered the second one within two weeks. While water entered several houses and shops, connectivity was cut off at many places as roads and bridges remain submerged. Families near Kunjuman canal were shifted to safe places following the incident, but some tribal families in Ambathekkar, Peramkovil in Villumala were isolated for several hours. The debris and mudslide caused traffic disruption in many locations that include the Achencoil-Alimukku and Kodamala. The Revenue Department had decided to conduct a study in the landslide-prone parts of the district after the first incident in October. A house and three vehicles were washed away in Edappalayam while many houses suffered partial damage. Study to be conducted The Departments of Geology, Soil Conservation, and Groundwater were directed to conduct a study of the disaster-hit areas to find if they are habitable during heavy rain. The series of landslides had snapped power supply in the area and water pumping too was hit. According to residents, the change in the intensity and pattern of rainfall during the last couple of years has made their lives unpredictable. Families living in layams at Ambanad had to move out at night after water gushed inside their houses and farmers in many locations in the eastern parts are currently staring at an uncertain future. Meanwhile, the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has issued an orange alert, as the three shutters of the Thenmala dam have been raised by 80 cm following heavy rain in the catchment area. The authorities have directed those living in riverbanks and low-lying areas to stay alert and move to safe places if required. The district administration has opened 24-hour control rooms at the district headquarters and all taluks for coordinating relief activities. The Public could contact the control rooms by dialling 0474 2794002, 2794004 (Kollam Collectorate), 0474 2742116 (Kollam taluk), 0476 2620223 (Karunagapally taluk), 0474 2454623 (Kottarakara taluk), 0476 2830345 (Kunnathur taluk), 0475 2350090 (Pathanapuram taluk), and 0475 2222605 (Punalur taluk).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/repeated-flash-floods-worry-east-kollam/article37467319.ece
13 November 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||State Govt. locks horns with CAG over KIIFB again||The State Government on Friday appeared to find itself at loggerheads with the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) over the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) again. Finance Minister K.N. Balagopal strongly objected to the CAG’s latest finding that KIIFB’s “off-Budget borrowings” via masala bonds and other instruments to “finance expenditures” violated the Kerala Fiscal Responsibility Act. The CAG had tabled its State Finance Audit report ended 2020 in the Assembly on Thursday. CAG findings For the second consecutive financial year, the CAG had observed that KIIFB’s borrowings lacked legislative approval or scrutiny and warned the State could find itself caught in a debt trap. The CAG had also questioned the constitutionality of raising loans through government-controlled entities such as the Kerala Social Security Pension Ltd (KSSPL) to bypass the Net Borrowing Ceiling of States. The CAG had also rejected the State’s contention that KIIFB’s bid to raise funds from foreign financial markets to fund essential infrastructure development had legislative approval. They were not outside Budget borrowings. ‘Rejected report’ Mr. Balagopal said the CAG had merely echoed the findings in the previous audit reported ended 2019. The Assembly had rejected the findings. “It’s anybody’s guess why the CAG is reiterating its erroneous stance,” he said. Oppn. charge Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala slammed the Government for undermining the CAG. He said the Constitutional authority had correctly pointed out that KIIFB's loans and spendings were beyond the pale of the legislature. They were excluded from budget documents and not subject to legislative scrutiny. The CPI(M) had doubted the CAGs findings as politically biased and damaging to the developmental aspirations of the State. It felt that CAG’s observations chipped away at the financial trustworthiness of KIIFB, a body corporate created by an act of law.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/state-govt-locks-horns-with-cag-over-kiifb-again/article37467264.ece
13 November 2021||KALPETTA,||Rice blast disease haunts Wayanad farmers||Rice blast, a fungal disease affecting paddy, is haunting farmers who had raised “Manuvarna”, a new rice variety released by the Kerala Agricultural University recently, on more than 250 acres in Wayanad district. K. Kesava Marar, president of the Cheekkallur Padashekhara Samiti, cultivated the new rice variety on 70 acres of rented land after learning from some farmers in Palakkad district that it had given higher yields than the traditional rice varieties. Mr. Marar, along with 60 other farmers of the samiti, procured the 4,600 kg of seeds from the Kerala Agricultural University at a cost of Rs. 42 kg. However, they noticed a few weeks ago that the crop cultivated on more than 250 acres of land was damaged owing to the blast disease. Mr.Marar said he had spent around Rs. 35,000 an acre for the cultivation, including rent, but, he could not recoup one-third of it after the harvest. The condition of other farmers who had cultivated the crop under the Panamaram, Kaniyampetta, and Mananthavady Krishi Bhavans was not different, he said. When a group of scientists of the Regional Agricultural Research Station (RARS) at Ambalavayal visited the site recently, they noticed that the crop in the grain filling stage was damaged by the blast disease and more than 150 acres of area has been affected under the Cheekallur Padashekara Samiti. The blast disease is caused by the fungus Pyricularia oryzae which is non-systemic in action. The spores of the fungus could have been released from hosts like Purple nutsedge and Echinochloa crusgalli (Muthanga and Kavada respectively in local parlance) which are abundantly present in the paddy fields, bunds, and on sides of irrigation channel of the affected area. This would have resulted in an increased concentration of spores in the air. Relative humidity of more than 93% and rainfall below 5 mm per day are the major predisposing factors especially during the mid tillering stage of the crop for the incidence of the blast, RARS sources said. The ‘Manuvarna’ variety of paddy was released for the low lands of Kerala, especially for the kole lands, wetland ecosystem, K. Ajith Kumar, Associate Director, RARS, told The Hindu.  Adoption of prophylactic measures of management would have substantially reduced the severity of blast disease incidence, Dr . Ajithkumar said. However, such measures were not taken properly in the affected area which led to severe damage due to the incidence of neck blast, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rice-blast-disease-haunts-wayanad-farmers/article37467267.ece
13 November 2021||MANGALURU,||We are working to develop new leaders who’ll be committed to the nation’s cause: Kateel||The convention of members of 24 State-level Prakostas (committees) of the BJP is meant to re-imbibe the party’s thoughts and ideals among participants and help develop new leaders who will stay committed to the cause of the country, said State BJP president and Dakshina Kannada Member of Parliament Nalin Kumar Kateel here on Friday. Inaugurating a two-day Chintana Varga for members of the Prakostas, Mr. Kateel said that these Prakostas are nothing new as they have been in existence in the party since long and also, in the erstwhile Jan Sangh. “During this two-day event, we are having sessions to re-imbibe the party’s thoughts and develop new leaders who will work towards building the country,” he said. The State unit, he said, is the first where orientation is being held for Prakosta members. Each Prakosta has 11 members. Similar orientation programmes will be held for members of Prakostas in the district and block levels. “Our State unit is among the few BJP units that have well organised Prakotas,” he said. The party is committed to ensuring inclusive growth of the country and it is continuing with the practices enunciated by senior party leaders, including Deendayal Upadhaya, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani who strived to bring the party to power. It is because of the strong foundation laid by the seniors that the party has not seen any split so far. Vajpayee and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have given corruption-free administration and the country is being well received by other countries. State convenors of Chintana Varga M.B. Bhanuprakash and A.H. Shivayogi Swamy also spoke. During the two-day programme, there will be talks by senior party workers on various issues concerning the State. BJP National General Secretaries B.L. Santosh and Arun Singh are likely to take part in the deliberations on Saturday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/we-are-working-to-develop-new-leaders-wholl-be-committed-to-the-nations-cause-kateel/article37467594.ece

13 November 2021||Bengaluru,||Maintain etiquette or forfeit your ticket||Bus passengers will have to be mindful of mobile phone etiquette and refrain from blaring music or watching clips on their devices without earphones if they do not wish to be offloaded. The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) has barred passengers from streaming content directly from their mobile phone speakers. Those who fail to follow the rules will be deboarded, according to a KSRTC circular issued on Friday. Shivayogi C. Kalasad, managing director of KSRTC, said that the circular was issued after several complaints were received from passengers. “Using mobile phone speakers to watch films and news clips or listening to music is a nuisance in public places. While travelling, such behaviour intrudes into the privacy of co-passengers. Moreover, it is distracting for the driver if the passenger is sitting nearby and streaming content directly from the speakers,” he said. The circular stated that the conductor would issue a warning, but if the passenger continues to flout the rules, he or she would be deboarded from the bus. The driver should stop the bus until the passenger left. The circular added that violators would not be able to claim a refund of the ticket fare. “We have issued the circular as per provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act. Complaints can be filed against those who fail to follow the instruction of the conductor or driver and continue to violate the rules. If anyone wants to use their mobiles, they can do so using earphones,” Mr. Kalasad added. The rule has been welcomed not just by regular bus commuters but also conductors and drivers. A KSRTC driver-cum- conductor who works on long-distance AC buses said it was a nuisance especially in night service buses. “Some people continue to use their mobile speakers to watch films or play music even after the driver switches off the light so that people could sleep. A few passengers complain, but most don’t,” he said. “Our dependency on mobile phones has increased so much that we should always carry earphones. Often, I come across passengers who chat for hours in night service buses without realising that it is disturbing others,” said Chaitra N., who regularly travels on State-run buses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/maintain-etiquette-or-forfeit-your-ticket/article37466992.ece

13 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Industrial output falls 2.6% in September||India’s industrial output fell 2.6% month-on-month in September, even as retail inflation inched up marginally to 4.48% in October with a sharper rise in urban price trends, as per data from the National Statistical Office. Compared to September 2020, the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) grew 3.1% in September 2021, the pace of growth dipping sharply from the 12% recorded in August. Industry blamed the moderation in industrial output to supply side constraints. “High commodity prices and shortages of raw materials are impacting the production and overall growth of the IIP,” said PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Pradeep Multani, adding that input prices might subside a bit due to the fuel tax cuts. While the sharp deceleration in IIP growth is mainly because of the base effect, the sequential decline is a cause of concern, said Rajani Sinha, chief economist at Knight Frank India. “For sustainable economic momentum in 2022, the critical driver would be boost to consumer spending through demand stimulating government policies,” she said. “Activity in the infrastructure and construction has come down, which may not bode well for rural demand and the externality effects associated with this sector,” noted Deloitte India economist Rumki Majumdar. Although consumer price inflation moved nominally to 4.48% in October from 4.35% in September, urban parts of the country experienced a steeper bounce from 4.57% to 5.04% in October. Food prices at the consumer level recorded an inflation of 0.85% in October, marginally higher than 0.68% the previous month but urban consumers experienced a higher inflation of 1.72%. However, inflation in oil and fats remained high at 33.5% in October, while transport and communication inflation stood at 10.9%. “The sharp month-on month rise of 2.3% in the food and beverages index was driven by the 14.2% spike in vegetable prices, a trend which is expected to persist in the ongoing month with the further rise in the prices of staples such as potatoes, onions and tomatoes,” said ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar, adding that the fuel tax cuts announced recently might soften the November inflation print. Automobile manufacturing fell 9% in September from a year ago.Auto production slid for the second month in a row, declining 3.3% over August output, as per the IIP, possibly due to persisting chip shortages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/retail-inflation-up-a-little-to-448-in-october/article37466962.ece
13 November 2021||NEW DELHI/Chennai,||Railways to resume regular train services||Nearly 20 months after the pandemic disrupted operations, the Indian Railways on Friday said it would resume regular trains with pre-COVID fares. “...Ministry of Railways have decided that all regular time-tabled Trains which are presently operating as MSPC [Mail/Express Special] and HSP [Holiday Special] train services... shall be operated with regular numbers and with fare and categorisation as applicable,” the national carrier said. The Railways had stopped passenger services in March last year due to the pandemic, gradually resuming services from May 2020 in a phased manner. However, most of the resumed trains were operating as ‘special trains’ for which ticket prices were higher than regular trains, without concessions for senior citizens. The number for these train numbers began with ‘0’. In a letter to Principal Chief Commercial Managers on Friday, the Railways added that for tickets booked in advance, no difference of fare either to be collected by Railways or any refund due to already booked passengers will be permitted. “Second class of such trains shall continue to run as reserved except any relaxation permitted in special case,” it added. A Railways spokesperson added that COVID-related restrictions such as not providing linens will continue. The Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS) has been asked to make necessary changes in the software to reflect the changes. Additionally, each zonal railway has been directed to ensure that necessary arrangements are made to make the details available to all the staff well in advance and necessary changes are made in the database.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/railways-to-resume-regular-train-services/article37466898.ece

13 November 2021||Hyderabad,||Press raided for printing book on RK||A printing press at Amberpet, which was publishing a book, Ayuda Shanti Swapnam , on top Maoist leader and Central Committee member Akkiraju Hargopal alias Ramakrishna alias RK, who died recently, was raided by Hyderabad city police on Friday. Police seized over 1,000 copies of the book which is a compilation of his interviews, literature and biography, apart from computers, pen drives and stacks of printed paper sheets (unbinded). Acting on credible information that the was being printed at Navya Printing Press, a police team raided the premises and found the material. Printing press owner and social activist Sandhya’s husband Ramakrishna Reddy was arrested for allegedly 'supporting' the activities of outlawed CPI (Maoist). “They book allegedly contain chapters, incidents, supporting the Maoist ideology and spreading their message,” Additional DCP (East Zone) K. Murlidhar said. He said that press owner Ramakrishna Reddy supported banned outfit’s activities. Meanwhile, social activist Sandhya said that RK’s wife Sirisha wanted to publish a book on her ‘martyr’ husband and approached her along with civil rights activist Suresh and VIRASAM Pinakapani. “My husband agreed to publish the book. I also requested my husband to publish the book. We don’t know the contents of the book,” Ms.Sandhya said. Mobile phones of the press workers were also seized by the police, she accused. When contacted, a senior officer said that a press conference will be held on Saturday to give details of the raid and seizure. Ramakrishna passed away on October 14 due to kidney failure.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/press-raided-for-printing-rks-biography/article37467453.ece

13 November 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||GST has failed to achieve its objectives, says Balagopal||Goods and Services Tax (GST) has failed to achieve its professed objectives and has badly hit the finances of States, including Kerala, Finance Minister K. N. Balagopal said on Friday. Delivering the inaugural address at the international seminar on ‘India’s experience with GST’ organised by the Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation (GIFT), he said this year Kerala would have a shortfall of Rs. 13,000 crore in GST compensation alone. Next year the shortfall is likely to be around Rs. 10,000 crore. “We are witnessing a worst-case scenario where the revenues of the States are plummeting,” he said. Mr. Balagopal said corrections can be made in the system through careful deliberations and a systematic approach. Vital issue The GST is a vital issue which questions the existence of cooperative and fiscal federalism. The States had ceded 44% of their rights to collect indirect taxes when GST was rolled out, while the Centre relinquished only 28%. Nonetheless, the revenue sharing between the Centre and States is based on a 50:50 ratio, he pointed out. Call for revamp Former Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac called for a revamp of the GST system. The experience with GST so far has been disappointing for all stakeholders, he said, adding it is important to have midway course corrections and restructuring of the system. Something has to be done to ensure that tax revenues remain buoyant, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/gst-has-failed-to-achieve-its-objectives-says-balagopal/article37467265.ece

13 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Centre turns to Chief Ministers to sustain economic recovery||With an eye on sustaining the economic recovery and spurring investment flows, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will preside over a meeting with bankers next week to take stock of concerns of critical sectors of the economy, while Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will host a meeting with State Chief Ministers and Finance Ministers on Monday. The Prime Minister is expected to interact with bankers on the second day of a two-day meeting scheduled for November 17 and 18, said a senior Government official. Unlike such meetings in the past, this time, challenges of sectors such as cement and steel, among others, were being identified and would be consolidated ahead of the Prime Minister’s session. “The parley with States will be about the state of the economy as a whole, as we are now at a critical juncture. The robust recovery has to be maintained, it can’t be that we just do well this year,” the official said. State-level issues While this Centre-State meeting was independent of pre-Budget consultations, the official said the Budget 2022-23 would be focused on sustaining the recovery, as opposed to this year’s Budget, which was largely about coping with the COVID-19 pandemic. Finance Secretary T.V. Somanathan, at a briefing about Monday’s meeting, said several things that were needed to be done to take India to a higher growth path were in the States’ domain. “Nothing can happen without the States. The focus of this interaction will be on State-level issues, challenges and opportunities, and evolving an inclusive growth trajectory for all Indians,” he said. “The hope is that after this discussion where the States’ views and inputs on how things can be done better and their challenges will be aired, each State would have a clearer appreciation of what needs to be done and the Centre will support them in whatever needs to be done,” he added. Two-way process Ajay Seth, Economic Affairs Secretary, said the meeting would not just be focusing on enhancing public infrastructure spending, but also on attracting more investments and creating jobs. “States would be requested to look at investor concerns such as land availability, land pricing, water and electricity supply issues and various approvals from urban local bodies. It will be a two-way process where States can also talk about the reforms needed at the Central level,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-turns-to-chief-ministers-to-sustain-economic-recovery/article37466864.ece
13 November 2021||New Delhi,||P.C. Mody made RS Secretary-General||Pramod Chandra Mody, a 1982-batch retired IRS officer and former Chairman of the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), was on Friday appointed the Secretary-General of the Rajya Sabha, replacing P.P.K. Ramacharyulu. Mr. Ramcharyulu was posted just 73 days ago on September 1 as the Secretary-General and is perhaps the only person who had occupied the post not to attend a single session of Parliament. He has had the shortest tenure so far . No reason was given for his unceremonious exit. He joined the Rajya Sabha Secretariat in 1983 and was the first person who rose from the ranks to occupy the position. Curiously, Mr. Ramcharyulu’s appointment order did not prescribe a tenure. In contrast, Mr. Mody’s appointment order clearly lays down a one-year tenure for him. Mr. Ramcharyulu, meanwhile, has been reassigned as adviser for a one-year term. Mr. Mody, who took charge on Friday, has had one of the longest tenures as CBDT chief, getting three extensions in total. He spent 27 months from February 2019 to May 2021 in the post. During his tenure, the Board had searched the premises of the leaders of many Opposition parties. The list includes the premises of the daughter and son-in-law of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin ahead of the Assembly election in the State. The frequent searches were criticised by the Opposition parties, who alleged the Union Government was using the CBDT as a political tool. The Opposition leaders reacted sharply to Mr. Ramacharyulu’s sudden exit. The Congress’s Rajya Sabha Chief Whip, Jairam Ramesh, in a tweet, said, “Not surprised at all. Dr. P.P.K. Ramacharyulu is a thorough professional, non-partisan and perfectly qualified for the post — three deadly sins in the Modi regime.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pc-mody-made-rs-secretary-general/article37466872.ece
13 November 2021||Chennai,||Reflecting ‘resilience of human spirit’||The Hindu ’s annual literary festival, Lit For Life, returned after two years in a digital avatar, having been interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. “While not ideal, we hope it [the digital version of the festival] will keep the readers and viewers engaged with books and authors till such time as we are able to meet in person in the next Lit for Life,” said N. Ravi, Chairman, Kasturi & Sons, and Publisher, The Hindu Group, in his inaugural address. Dr. Nirmala Lakshman, Festival Director, The Hindu Lit for Life, and Director, The Hindu Group, echoed this sentiment: “We are determined in the times ahead to get back to creating exciting literary events that will move forward to restoring what we had as a festival. This digital version of The Hindu Lit for Life reflects that spirit of hope and faith and the resilience of the human spirit.” The inaugural session featured Indra Nooyi, former CEO of PepsiCo, speaking on her book My Life in Full: Work, Family and Our Future . She was in conversation with Vinay Kamath, Senior Associate Editor, The Hindu Business Line . Ms. Nooyi said, “Somebody like me, so different, coming as an immigrant to the U.S. and being given a chance to lead an iconic American company…something like this happens only in America.” The lesson from her experiences in corporate America is: “If talent is your competitive advantage, [we need to look at] how do we bring the best and the brightest in to serve whatever entity we are looking at.” Next up was Member of Parliament and bestselling author Shashi Tharoor speaking on ‘Life, Literature, Language and Politics’. His conversation with Sashi Kumar, journalist, filmmaker and media entrepreneur, centred largely on Mr. Tharoor’s political journey, beliefs, and his take on some recent political events. “My idiosyncratic willingness to speak my mind is not always a most welcome thing in politics,” Mr. Tharoor confessed, yet taking pride in his ability to speak frankly. The conversation also covered ‘Tharoorism’, language prowess, and his latest book, Pride, Prejudice & Punditry .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/reflecting-resilience-of-human-spirit/article37466889.ece
13 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. to assess learning gaps via nationwide test||The first National Achievement Survey (NAS) in four years was conducted on Friday, in a bid to assess the competencies of children in Class 3, 5 and 8. This will “help to assess the learning interruptions and new learnings during the COVID pandemic and help to take remedial measures,” said the Education Ministry. Given that schools across the country were closed for 18 months from March 2020, and the vast majority of students did not have any access to remote education, the NAS is expected to reveal the level of learning losses caused by the shutdown. However, the pandemic affected the conduct of the survey as well, as schools in many States have still not reopened classes for younger students. Even where schools are officially open, attendance is voluntary. The survey test was conducted in language, mathematics and environmental studies in Classes 3 and 5 and language, mathematics, science, and social science in Class 8. The survey was expected to cover 38 lakh students in 1.23 lakh schools in 733 districts in all States and Union Territories. The sampled schools include State and Union Government-run schools as well as private and aided schools. The test paper was provided in a multiple choice format in 22 different languages. The test was developed by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), which will also analyse the results, while the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) conducted the test on Friday. The Ministry said in the 24 States and Union Territories from which information had been received on Friday, almost 92% of the target sample and 96% of target schools participated in the survey. There was no information from 12 other States.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-to-assess-learning-gaps-via-nationwide-test/article37466941.ece
13 November 2021||New Delhi,||Form JPC on FB manipulation: Cong.||The Congress on Friday wrote to Mark Zuckerberg, protesting against “apparent and evident” bias of Facebook towards the ruling dispensation and demanded a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) investigation into alleged manipulation of elections by the U.S.-based tech firm. Rohan Gupta, Congress’s social media in-charge, shot off the letter to Mr. Zuckerberg, saying that in the past two years, an abundance of evidence had been released that point to the negligence by the company in controlling hate speech. “I want to bring to your notice the apparent and evident bias that your company has shown in our country towards the ruling dispensation despite their proclivity for sharing hate speech, misinformation, fake news and inflammatory content on your platform,” he said. An internal report of Facebook, authored by an employee in February 2019, based on findings of a test account, showed that post the February 14 Pulwama terror attack, users had seen “more images of dead people in the past three weeks than seen in their entire life”. The report also pointed out that the AI (Artificial Intelligence) that Facebook used was not adequate to identify vernacular languages. Mr. Gupta urged Mr. Zuckerberg to conduct an internal inquiry into the functioning of Facebook India and release the findings to the public. “It is your responsibility as the head of this organisation to hold those responsible for betraying our people accountable for their action,” he said. The party held a press conference at its headquarters in Delhi that was addressed by Mr. Gupta and Praveen Chakravarty, chairperson of its data and technology cell. “The world’s largest democracy is being manipulated by an American tech company. This is not any more about the Congress or the BJP, it is about India and Indians. It is about the sanctity of our democracy. Are we going to accept this kind of control of our society? It’s time for us to come together and resist this,” Mr. Chakravarty said. Facebook-owned WhatsApp was a messaging platform used widely in the country. This made the internal reports of Facebook more alarming, Mr. Chakravarty said. “Facebook is open and public. If there is such an amount of hate content on Facebook, imagine the extent of spread in WhatsApp, which is a private medium.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/form-jpc-on-fb-manipulation-cong/article37466870.ece
13 November 2021||CHENNAI,||Lawyers oppose transfer of Madras High Court CJ||Over 200 lawyers have made a common representation to the Supreme Court collegium, urging it to reconsider its recommendation to transfer Madras High Court Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee to the High Court of Meghalaya. The lawyers said his transfer, from a chartered High Court with a sanctioned strength of 75 judges, to one with a strength of just two judges raised questions. The signatories to the representation include N.G.R. Prasad, senior counsel R. Vaigai, V. Prakash, Anna Mathew, Sudha Ramalingam, Rupert J. Barnabas, Geeta Ramaseshan, Bader Sayeed, Henri Tiphagne, V. Suresh and T. Lajapathi Roy. They insisted upon their right to know why a “competent and fearless judge and an efficient administrator” of a High Court, where more than 35,000 cases were filed a year, should be transferred to a court where only 70 to 75 cases get filed a month. “It is well known in the legal circles in Tamil Nadu that to ensure a totally free and independent judiciary, inquires were afoot under the tenure of Chief Justice Banerjee to check corruption in the judiciary. His intolerance for corruption and inefficiency is well known and widely appreciated,” they said. “The instant transfer will quell any such efforts to strengthen the judiciary in the State... We request that the collegium may reconsider, in public interest, its decision to transfer Justice Banerjee to the Meghalaya High Court,” the representation read. The lawyers recalled orders passed by the Chief Justice against the establishment and asked whether he was being victimised for his actions, since the reasons for the recommendation had not been disclosed by the collegium.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/lawyers-oppose-move-to-transfer-cj/article37467040.ece
13 November 2021||New Delhi/Jaipur,||Truce likely in Rajasthan Congress||Senior Congress leader Sachin Pilot indicated on Friday that a truce may be in sight between him and Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot over the Cabinet reshuffle in the State, after a 45-minute meeting with Congress president Sonia Gandhi. This was Mr. Pilot’s first meeting with Ms. Gandhi since his July 2020 rebellion, when he nearly walked out of the Congress with 18 MLAs, pushing the Gehlot Government in Rajasthan to the brink. Ms. Gandhi also had a meeting with Mr. Gehlot on Thursday. Speaking to presspersons at the end of the meeting, Mr. Pilot said that a decision would be taken very soon. “There are a few vacancies in the State Cabinet which need to be filled and a balance needs to be set,” he said. He hoped that the appointments would be made keeping in mind experience, credibility, performance, and regional and caste balance. Nine vacancies There are currently nine vacancies in the Rajasthan Cabinet. If the party goes by the “one man, one post” formula, which Mr. Pilot is insisting upon, three Ministers from the current Cabinet will be dropped. Education Minister Govind Singh Dotasra is the Pradesh Congress Committee president; Health Minister Raghu Sharma was recently appointed All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge of Gujarat; and Revenue Minister Harish Chaudhary was made in-charge of Punjab. The key question pertains to Mr. Pilot’s own role in a post-reshuffle scenario. Mr. Gehlot, according to sources, is not willing to give him the Deputy Chief Minister’s post back. As a compromise formula, the Central leadership is expected to offer him a role with the party in Delhi. When asked specifically whether he would be willing to take on such a responsibility, Mr. Pilot said, “Whatever the Congress party wants me to do, I am more than happy to do. In the last 20 years, whatever job has been assigned, I have done it diligently and now also, whatever the party decides, what role I should have...I am happy to do it.” The Ashok Gehlot Government will be completing three years on December 17.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/truce-likely-in-rajasthan-congress/article37466896.ece
13 November 2021||New Delhi,||Panel report on data Bill stalled again||The report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on Personal Data Protection Bill has been stalled once again, after a few last-minute changes were proposed, deleting clauses that hold data fiduciaries such as Facebook, Twitter and so on accountable. Apart from this, the penalty clause was reworked, drastically reducing the prescribed amount. According to informed sources, three key sub-clauses were removed from the draft Bill that was circulated to the committee members on Thursday night by Chairman P.P. Chaudhary. At the meeting, the members protested since each clause of the Bill had already been deliberated upon and Friday’s meeting was to adopt the final report. The bone of contention is Clause 28 pertaining to “rights in relation to automated decision making”. Three sub-clauses, which basically give the data owner the right to file a complaint against the data controller, were removed. Many Opposition members registered their protest. “We have been discussing this Bill for more than two years now. Each clause has been deliberated upon. Clause 28 and all its sub-clauses were debated and unanimously adopted. Then why bring in this last-minute change,” one member told The Hindu on condition of anonymity. On objections by the members, Mr. Chaudhary reportedly argued that these provisions are better placed in the Information and Technology Act rather than here. Officials of the Ministry of Electronics and Information and Technology, who were present, said the latest IT rules for the intermediaries deal with social media accountability and there would be a duplicity if this is also included in the data protection law, the sources said. The provisions of penalty for misuse of data were also amended. The draft Bill provides for a penalty of Rs. 5 crore-15 crore, with an upper limit of 2-4% of the total turnover of a data firm. This provision of fining the errant firm up to 2-4% of turnover was removed. “In our discussions so far, we have not touched upon this clause. The penalty clause had been same as the Bill drafted by the Government,” a member said. The discussions have been pushed to the meeting on November 22.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/panel-report-on-data-bill-stalled-again/article37466861.ece
13 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Permanent commission for 11 women Army officers||The Union Government on Friday agreed to grant permanent commission (PC) to 11 women Army officers who met the eligibility criteria after the Supreme Court threatened to initiate contempt proceedings. The Centre, which was initially reluctant, conveyed its acquiescence to a Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud to grant PC to the officers within 10 days. Short Service Commission (SSC) women officers, who have not approached the court but nonetheless meet the various eligibility criteria, would be granted PC in three weeks, the Government informed the court. In October, the court similarly intervened in favour of granting PC to 39 other SSC women officers. “We appreciate the fair stand of the Army authority in putting at rest all outstanding issues pertaining to women SSC officers,” the court recorded at the end. The Bench, also comprising Justice A.S. Bopanna, was hearing a contempt petition filed by the 11 officers, who alleged they were denied PC despite crossing the eligibility threshold. However, the court clarified that “by way of abundant caution, it is clarified that those officers who have disciplinary and vigilance clearance will be eligible to grant of PC, subject to their meeting of other conditions...” In August, over 70 women officers approached the court, challenging the Army’s decision finding them ineligible for PC. They said they were disqualified despite satisfying the 60% assessment threshold for PC as prescribed by the court. The order had said PC should be given to women SSC officers who obtained 60% marks in their assessment, subject to their meeting the medical criteria prescribed by the Army’s August 1, 2020, order and receiving disciplinary and vigilance clearance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/permanent-commission-for-11-women-army-officers/article37466944.ece
13 November 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||‘Cybercrime went up by 500% during pandemic’||The Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS), General Bipin Rawat, has stressed the need for a national framework to thwart cyberattacks that have been on the rise in the country. While a national cybersecurity strategy is in the offing, the country is also in dire need of a data protection law, with cybercriminals increasingly weaponising data as a tool against national security in the post-pandemic era, he added. Gen. Rawat was delivering the inaugural address of the 14th edition of c0c0n, the annual cybersecurity and hacking conference organised by the Kerala Police, which formally got under way on Friday. Relying on technology “Cyber crimes have gone up by almost 500% in India during the global pandemic. We need to consider the emerging threats from new technologies such as drones, ransomware, Internet of Things (IoT) devices and also the role of nation states in such cyber attacks. The lockdown, which witnessed a deeper adoption of interconnected devices and hybrid work environment, has increased our dependence on technology. This renders us digitally more vulnerable than ever before,” he said. Highlighting the possibility of Government officials who deal with sensitive information becoming prime targets for cyberattacks, Gen. Rawat lamented the fragmented approach that prevailed in handling the threat. The national cybersecurity strategy was aimed at amalgamating individual cyberprowess, he said. General Rawat said the Information Technology Act, 2000, that dealt with cybersecurity and cybercrimes is not equipped to consider new-age changes in the mode of functioning of businesses and modus operandi of crimes in cyberspace. The CDS also lamented the delay in passing the Personal Data Protection Bill that had been tabled in Parliament two years ago. “Data is the new goldmine for any organisation, especially for the bad elements that lurk in the dark web. With cyber criminals and inimical actors increasingly using information to threaten national security, the matter is of serious concern,” General Rawat said. Kerala Police Chief Anil Kant, Additional Director-General of Police Manoj Abraham, Information Security Research Association president Manu Zacharia and Society for the Policing of Cyberspace executive director Bessie Pang spoke.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cybercrime-went-up-by-500-during-pandemic/article37466878.ece
13 November 2021||Chennai,||Of swamps and viruses||“The Sundarbans has been a large part of my life. It’s a strange and wild landscape,” said author Amitav Ghosh of the mangroves that feature in his book Jungle Nama , during a session on Day 1 at The Hindu Lit for Life 2021. He was in conversation with Somak Ghoshal, writer, and the books editor of Mint Lounge . Mr. Ghosh spoke at length about the story and verse in the book in which he uses the vernacular poyar meter adapted for the English language. “Reading in silence was not a practice until the late 18th century. Until then, reading was a collective exercise where people experienced a text together. I wanted to go back, recreate a text that could exist in these multiple iterations,” explained Mr. Ghosh. The final session of the day had biochemist Pranay Lal talk about science writing and viruses in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr. Lal was in conversation with Ramya Kannan, Tamil Nadu bureau chief, The Hindu . “Viruses or pathogens that we treat as enemies are enemies, of course, but we need to accord them a certain sense of respect or give them a little more importance for their larger role in the ecology,” said Mr. Lal, author of Invisible Empire: The Natural History of Viruses . “We are micro specialised in our sciences so much that we forget that there are other things operating together with the microbe to cause the disease it does.” The sessions can be viewed at: https://bit.ly/THLFLD1||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/of-swamps-and-viruses/article37466892.ece
13 November 2021||AHMEDABAD,||Gujarat civic bodies target non-veg food vendors||The Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled civic bodies in Vadodara, Rajkot, Bhavnagar and Junagadh in Gujarat have launched a drive against hawkers and vendors running non-vegetarian food joints along streets and footpaths on the ground that selling non-veg food items in the open “hurts religious sentiments”. The civic bodies have directed the vendors to either stop selling non-vegetarian food items in their joints or have them covered so that people cannot see it while passing on the roads or walking on footpaths. ‘Oral orders’ Though no official notifications have been issued, but the elected wings of the civic bodies have orally directed the officials to ensure that carts and joints selling non-vegetation and egg dishes on the streets remain invisible to common people as it “hurts the religious sentiments of the Hindus”. The civic bodies have been emboldened by Gujarat’s Revenue and Law Minister Rajendra Trivedi’s statement who said that such food joints or kiosks should be removed. ‘Removing hurdles’ The officials in the civic bodies maintain that the drive is to remove encroachment along the main roads where vendors and kiosks have encroached upon the footpaths, creating hurdles for pedestrians and causing traffic jams. In Rajkot, mayor Pradeep Dave himself launched the drive following complaints. He also had meetings with some non-vegetarian food vendors and asked them to relocate from the main roads in the city. Similarly in Vadodara, the standing committee chairman Hitendra Patel issued the directive asking to remove all roadside non-vegetarian food stalls and kiosks if they are not covered. “The vendors are being asked to ensure that they do not hang or display non-vegetarian food in their stalls or carts. They will have to keep it covered to main hygiene and sentiments of those who don’t eat non-vegetarian food,” he said. On Friday, civic bodies in Junagadh and Bhavnagar also issued the similar directives stating that public display of meat and non-vegetarian food is not good.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/gujarat-civic-bodies-target-non-veg-food-vendors/article37467165.ece
13 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Remote education was inaccessible to most children’||Only 20% of school-age children in India had access to remote education during the pandemic, of whom only half participated in live online lessons, according to a new national sample survey by ICRIER and LIRNEAsia, a think tank focused on digital policy. In fact, 38% of households said at least one child had dropped out of school due to COVID-19. The survey, released on Friday, found that although digital connectivity shot up 40% during the pandemic, low access to devices, poor signal and high costs prevented most children from reaping the benefits. 7,000 households covered The face-to-face survey, conducted between March and August this year, covered a nationally representative sample of 7,000 households. Only Kerala was excluded, due to high COVID-19 cases. Among children aged 5-18, it found that 80% of those who were enrolled in schools prior to the pandemic did not receive any educational services at all during school closure. The situation was significantly worse among those from lower socio-economic classes, where the head of the household had lower education levels, and among rural households. Among the 20% who received education, only 55% had access to live online classes, while 68% had access to recorded audio or video lessons. Three-fourths of the students had work sent to them over a smartphone, usually via WhatsApp, and 61% via text messages. Almost 70% had contact with their teachers via phone calls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/remote-education-was-inaccessible-to-most-children/article37466859.ece
13 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||PM to inaugurate Kashi Corridor project||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the Kashi Vishwanath Temple Corridor project on December 13 in Varanasi, his Lok Sabha constituency, alongside families of those displaced by the project. The inauguration comes with just a few months to go for the Uttar Pradesh Assembly election and has significance for the cultural politics for the State. According to senior sources in the BJP, at least 400 families were asked to vacate the area and many of the encroachments around the historic temple cleared to make way for the project that encapsulates the vision of the Holkar queen of Indore, Ahalya Bai Holkar, who created a series of temples and vistas leading up to the Ganga ghat. The project connects the temple with the ghats, with a paved walkway around 320 metres long and 20 metres wide. It will have a museum, a library, a pilgrim facilitation centre and a salvation house. According to Shashi Kumar, head of U.P. BJP’s social media cell, the function would see the presence of the main archakas of the 12 Jyotirlingas (of which Kashi is one), with water from all major rivers of the country being brought in for the abhishek of the main deity Baba Vishwanath (Lord Shiva). The project is important for Mr. Modi and is pegged at around Rs. 600 crore after launch in March 2018. An estimated Rs. 300 crore was spent on purchasing land and buildings, and for resettlement compensation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-to-inaugurate-kashi-corridor-project/article37466874.ece

A section of farmers had agreed to go for other crops this Rabi season, but BJP State leaders were creating confusion among farmers by asking them to cultivate paddy only and that they (BJP) would make the State government buy it. At Siddipet, Minister T. Harish Rao said they had protested against low-voltage issue, burning out of motor pump-sets due to voltage fluctuation, burn out of transformers, supply of sufficient power to raise crops during day-time and for adequate supply of fertilizers in the past. He stated that production of raw rice was not possible in the State due to the extreme hot weather conditions during the season allowing production of only boiled rice. In case the paddy produced in Rabi was processed (milled) without steaming, the percentage of broken rice would be very high up to 50%, making it completely uneconomical. Stating that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would respond to tweets swiftly, Mr. Harish Rao asked the farming community to tweet to PM in large numbers requesting purchase of boiled rice produced in the Rabi season or allow export of such rice by millers as a solution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/trs-voice-against-centre/article37467560.ece

13 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC adjourns Lakhimpur Kheri hearing to Monday||The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to a request made by the Uttar Pradesh Government to adjourn the Lakhimpur Kheri murders and violence case hearing to November 15. As soon as the case was called up for hearing before a Bench led by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana, senior advocate Harish Salve, for the Government, indicated that the case investigation was on track and the State needed time till Monday to come back to the court with the specifics. The Bench allowed the State the weekend and posted the case on Monday. The Government was expected to respond to a suggestion from the court to appoint a retired High Court judge to monitor the investigation into the case to “infuse fairness and impartiality”. Waning confidence The suggestion to have a retired judge at the helm came after the court expressed its waning confidence about the fate of the investigation at the hands of the Uttar Pradesh police. “The investigation is not going the way we expected... We are here to see that a proper investigation takes place. There is a need to appoint a retired High Court judge to monitor it [investigation] without bias,” Chief Justice Ramana said in the previous hearing. CBI’s takeover The court has so far refused to entertain suggestions from some lawyers to order the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to take over from the police. “The CBI is not the solution to everything,” Justice Surya Kant, on the Bench, had remarked. Ashish Mishra, son of Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Ajay Mishra, is a prime accused.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-adjourns-lakhimpur-kheri-hearing-to-monday/article37466858.ece

India has demanded a trillion dollars over the next decade from developed countries to adapt to and mitigate the challenges from global warming and has kept this as a condition for delivering on climate commitments made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In a late evening intervention, Richa Sharma, who is part of India’s negotiating team said: “The outcomes of COP26 must reflect the urgency in scaling up finance and other means of implementation support to developing countries. We express our disappointment at the lack of significant progress in climate finance related agenda items. We add our voice in support of other parties and groups like LDCs that have called for continuation of the long term finance agenda under the convention; for a mandate to the standing committee of finance to deliver a multilaterally agreed definition of climate finance, and for a structured process that will deliver the new quantified goal for climate finance well before 2025.” An earlier version of the draft also called upon countries to “accelerate” the phase out of coal subsidies, a point that wasn’t taken to kindly by India and China. Despite India’s commitments to increasing its reliance on renewable energy in the coming decade, it also expects to double its use of coal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/amid-debates-final-deal-eludes-cop26/article37466854.ece

The Taliban administration welcome the offer, reiterating its call for urgent assistance. “The Prime Minister conveyed that in the current context, Pakistan would favourably consider the request by Afghan brothers for transportation of wheat offered by India through Pakistan on exceptional basis for humanitarian purposes and as per modalities to be worked out,” said a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office of Pakistan.

13 November 2021||November 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Railways to resume regular train services||There were no concessions for senior citizens. The operation of COVID special trains had evoked sharp criticism from passengers, rights activists and others, who questioned the rationale behind charging extra fare with no additional benefit. Recently, the All India Railwaymen Federation (AIRF), the largest employees union of the Railways, criticised the Railway management for re-numbering regular trains and categorising them as special trains and charging more. Referring to the Chennai-Madurai route, AIRF president N. Kanniah had pointed out that there was an increase of Rs. 420 in First Class AC and Rs. 320 in Second AC. The increase in long distance trains was even higher where the passengers were charged in the name of Festival Special Train, he added. In a letter to Principal Chief Commercial Managers on Friday, the Railways added that for tickets booked in advance, no difference of fare either to be collected by Railways or any refund due to already booked passengers will be permitted. “Second class of such trains shall continue to run as reserved except any relaxation permitted in special case,” it added. A Railways spokesperson said COVID-related restrictions such as not providing linens would continue. The Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS) has been asked to make necessary changes in the software to reflect the changes. Additionally, each zonal railway has been directed to ensure that necessary arrangements are made to make the details available to all the staff well in advance and necessary changes are made in the database.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/railways-to-resume-regular-train-services/article37466942.ece
13 November 2021||November 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Industrial output falls 2.6% in September||While the sharp deceleration in IIP growth is mainly because of the base effect, the sequential decline is a cause of concern, said Rajani Sinha, chief economist at Knight Frank India. “For sustainable economic momentum in 2022, the critical driver would be boost to consumer spending through demand stimulating government policies,” she said. “Activity in the infrastructure and construction has come down, which may not bode well for rural demand and the externality effects associated with this sector,” noted Deloitte India economist Rumki Majumdar. Although consumer price inflation moved nominally to 4.48% in October from 4.35% in September, urban parts of the country experienced a steeper bounce from 4.57% to 5.04% in October. Food prices at the consumer level recorded an inflation of 0.85% in October, marginally higher than 0.68% the previous month but urban consumers experienced a higher inflation of 1.72%. However, inflation in oil and fats remained high at 33.5% in October, while transport and communication inflation stood at 10.9%. “The sharp month-on month rise of 2.3% in the food and beverages index was driven by the 14.2% spike in vegetable prices, a trend which is expected to persist in the ongoing month with the further rise in the prices of staples such as potatoes, onions and tomatoes,” said ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar, adding that the fuel tax cuts announced recently might soften the November inflation print. Automobile manufacturing fell 9% in September from a year ago. Auto production slid for the second month in a row, declining 3.3% over August output, as per the IIP, possibly due to persisting chip shortages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/retail-inflation-up-a-little-to-448-in-october/article37466866.ece

However, the court clarified that “by way of abundant caution, it is clarified that those officers who have disciplinary and vigilance clearance will be eligible to grant of PC, subject to their meeting of other conditions...” In August, a little over 72 women officers approached the court, challenging the Army’s decision finding them ineligible for PC. They said they were disqualified despite satisfying the 60% assessment threshold for PC as prescribed by the court in a judgment in March last. The order had directed the government to grant PC to “Women Short Service Commissions Officers who obtained 60% marks in their assessment subject to their meeting the medical criteria prescribed by the Army’s August 1 2020 order and receiving disciplinary and vigilance clearance.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/permanent-commission-for-11-women-officers/article37466865.ece

A Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar asked the petitioners’ lawyer, Shahrukh Alam, to serve copies of the petition on the Centre, the Delhi Government and the police. However, the court did not issue a formal notice. The Bench said it would, rather than deal with the case piecemeal, hear what the authorities had to say. The court posted the case later in November. The petition urged the court to fix the extent of liability of public authorities in case they wilfully allow hate speech in violation of the law. It said public authorities have a “duty of care” to prevent hate speeches targetting particular communities. The petition also sought the implementation of the anti-lynching guidelines issued by the court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-takes-up-plea-on-hate-speech-proliferation/article37466885.ece
13 November 2021||November 13 2021 00:00 IST,||In praise of Ganesha||Adi Sankara generally begins his bhakti stotras by invoking the concerned deity in the very first verse itself. But the acharya thinks it is appropriate to start the Subramanya Bhujanga, sung on Muruga at Tiruchendur, Siva’s younger son, with obeisance to the elder son Ganesha, said Sri B. Sundarkumar in a discourse. It is customary to seek Ganesha’s blessings before commencing any work for its successful completion. The first verse gives us a taste of the acharya’s fluency of thought and expression characteristic of the entire hymn. There is excellent use of literary devices such as simile, metaphor, symbol, myth, allusion, pun, etc, allowing room for interesting and varying interpretations. The Bhujanga metre that resembles the snake-like movement and the musical quality of the words are well matched with the lofty and profound import of the hymn. Always effulgent in his ‘Bala roopa,’ signifying his childlike form and nature, Ganesha is so powerful as to destroy all obstacles, even those that are insurmountable. Did he not lend a helping hand to his father Siva during Tripura Samhara when he set right the broken axle in the chariot wheel? The epithet Vigneshwara, the lord of all obstacles, is most apt because he has them under his full control and can make them ineffective. He thus receives the first honour in any religious or auspicious activity. ‘Maha danti vaktra’ refers to the elephant face of Ganesha, and there is a pun on ‘Panchasya’ which means Siva and a lion as well. The lion may be a terror to the elephant, but here the reference is to the five-faced Siva who respects his son Ganesha. As the leader of the Siva ganas, he is sought after by Brahma, Indra and others. ‘Ganas’ also means the aksharas and it thus refers to his mastery over language.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-praise-of-ganesha/article37466876.ece

The memorial, dedicated to those who laid down their lives in the Battle of Rezang La during the 1962 war, now includes the names of Army personnel who lost their lives in the violent clash at Galwan last year. November 18 marks the 59th anniversary of the Battle of Rezang La in which troops from the 13 Kumaon Regiment defeated several waves of the Chinese Army at a height of over 16,000 feet. In the battle, 114 of the 120 troops of the Charlie Company lost their lives and Maj. Shaitan Singh was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra (PVC), the country’s highest wartime gallantry award. The earlier memorial was a small one. It has now been expanded and will be on the tourist map of Ladakh, the source added. In October 2020, the Army had built a memorial at Post 120 in eastern Ladakh for the 20 personnel killed in the violent clash at Galwan Valley on June 15 that year. Post 120 lies along the Darbuk Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldi (DBO) road. The standoff in eastern Ladakh, which began last May, continues despite several rounds of diplomatic and military talks between India and China. In another development, Lt. Gen.

13 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Residents, DMK cadre clash during protest at Mandaveli||Residents in Mandaveli staged a protest on Friday, demanding that the authorities pump out the rainwater mixed with sewage that is entering their houses. However, the demonstration turned violent when a few DMK cadre had a heated exchange with the residents and assaulted them for blocking the road. On Thursday evening, after the road caved in on R.K. Mutt Road, the sewage pumps underground were damaged and the pumping station on St. Mary’s Road was shut down. Knee-deep rainwater mixed with sewage stagnated on Vinayagam Street, Devanathan Street, Thiruvalluvarpet Road and adjoining areas. Residents had a tough time bailing out the water. “Since Sunday, there has been no power, and the sewage water has been flowing into the houses. Neither the Corporation officials nor any other authority had visited the locality or taken steps to clear the water despite repeated calls,” a protesting resident said. Unsuccessful attempt The residents took the initiative and collected money to pump out the water, but they were unable to pump it out, he added. Agitated over the authorities’ poor response, the residents took to the streets on Friday noon, and a few of them blocked an arterial road, demanding immediate action, just a few metres from the Mylapore MLA office. While they were protesting on St. Mary’s Road, a DMK cadre, who was passing through, opposed the protesting residents, and had a heated argument with them. Later, a few other party members joined him, and the argument escalated to a physical assault. Tension prevailed in the area as both groups beat up one another. The police reached the spot, and pacified the residents.  Since Sunday, there has been no power, and the sewage water has been flowing into the houses.

13 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Police deploy hovercraft, drones for relief work||The police have deployed drones and mini-hovercraft fitted with surveillance cameras for relief and rescue work. For the last six days, police personnel have been conducting relief and rescue operations at many residential areas flooded with rainwater. They worked in coordination with the Fire and Rescue Services personnel, and staff from other departments have been removing trees that had fallen on roads and pumping out stagnant water in residential areas. As many as 13 Greater City Disaster Response Teams have been constituted, and each police district was allotted one team each. A senior police officer said, “With effect from Friday, we have deployed drones and mini-hovercraft fitted with cameras and public address systems to quickly reach out to people stranded in flooded areas.” Each Joint Commissioner of Police in the city has been allotted one team with drones and hovercraft. On Friday, personnel used them in Washermenpet, Tondiarpet, R.K. Nagar, Pulianthope, Kolathur, Marina beach, Pattinampakkam, Mylapore and Mambalam. R.R.

Subramanian. Approval “The college was started in 1966 with 50 medical seats. Another 50 seats were added in 1968, taking the total intake to 100. In 2004, another 50 seats were approved.

Already, a total of 1,450 seats were permitted in the 11 new government medical colleges in the State. With this, the total number of medical seats available in the government institutions had increased to 9,150, he said. Counselling Once the Union government issued the notification for admission under the 15% All India Quota, the Tamil Nadu Government would conduct counselling for MBBS admissions, he said. When asked about the Bill passed against the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test, he said the Governor was holding consultations with legal experts. 5,000 medical camps In view of rain-related illnesses, the Minister said that 5,000 medical camps would be held across the State on Saturday. Of this, 750 camps would be held in Chennai. On Sunday, the mega COVID-19 vaccination camps would be held in 50,000 places in the State.

13 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||NGT slams lax enforcement of ban on plastics||The southern bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has issued directions to the Chief Secretary and the Environment Secretary to revive the steering committee and the regional monitoring committees to implement the ban on single-use plastics in the State in letter and spirit. The Bench said this was required to protect the environment and life on earth. “The government must understand the need for protecting the environment, which has been expressed by world leaders in the recent UN Climate Change Conference (COP 26) in Glasgow,” the Bench said. The court took note of the submissions by the TNPCB and said steps had been taken by the authorities concerned to implement the ban, and closure orders were issued against units that manufacture such plastic articles. However, the petitioner had submitted photographs of the use of single-use plastic, to which the NGT said, “It shows the pathetic implementation of the ban on one-time use and throw plastics, and it is still used in grassroots level, especially by small vendors.” The Bench stated that if the regulators trace the source from where vendors procure these plastics, action could be taken against those violating the ban. Pointing out that the Chennai Collector had a pro-active role in implementing the ban, the Bench said the government should supply bio-degradable bags at subsidised rates to such vendors as an alternative to single use plastic bags. “Mere issuance of notice will not be sufficient unless there is a will. The government agencies, who are expected to implement the ban, will not be able to implement it in letter and spirit,” the Bench said. The agencies should continuously monitor and penalise those who flout the ban, the Bench added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ngt-slams-lax-enforcement-of-ban-on-plastics/article37467216.ece
13 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||I have no intention to seek publicity by insulting anyone, says Suriya||Suriya Sivakumar rejected PMK youth wing leader Anbumani Ramadoss’s charge that the actor’s recent film, Jai Bhim , had insulted the Vanniyars. He said he and the film crew had no intention to insult any community; in fact, changes were made to the film immediately after a few such instances were pointed out. In a statement, Mr. Suriya said, “I am doing my best to improve the lives of fellow human beings. I have the support and love of people belonging to all sections across India. I have no need or intention to seek publicity by insulting anyone.” He said that while he agreed that freedom of speech should not be used to insult any community, the right to freedom of speech should be protected from attacks. “The film is not a documentary, and it begins with a disclaimer that the story is fictionalised, based on a real incident. It also states that the incidents and the names do not refer to anyone or any incident in particular,” he said. “Those who do not really care about the vulnerable will use their power against them. In this respect, caste, religion, language and race doesn’t matter. There is evidence to prove this throughout the world.” Mr. Suriya said Dr. Anbumani Ramadoss’s similar criticism that the character of a police officer was named ‘Gurumurthy’ to hint at late PMK leader J. Guru was also made by others who said the character was named after another personality. “If the name of the antagonist is believed to refer to someone or the other in every case, there is no end to it. The voice of protest against injustice should not be turned into politics of ‘names’ and diluted.” CPI(M) State secretary K. Balakrishnan requested Mr. Suriya to extend financial assistance to Parvathi, wife of Rajakannu, whose death at the hands of the police was depicted in Jai Bhim . “Ms. Parvathi, who fought the case with courage, makes a living as a daily-wager in Chennai. You highlighted the problems of the suppressed sections in the film. I request you to extend a helping hand to her,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/i-have-no-intention-to-seek-publicity-by-insulting-anyone-suriya/article37467107.ece

13 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK leaders, Sasikala visit rain-hit areas||AIADMK coordinator O. Panneerselvam, co-coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami and the former interim general secretary, V.K. Sasikala, on Friday separately visited different rain-affected areas of Chennai. While Mr. Panneerselvam covered parts of West Mambalam, Virugambakkam, Kotturpuram, Saidapet and Villivakkam, Mr. Palaniswami went to Pushpa Nagar at Nungambakkam, Velachery, Teynampet, Mylapore, Kottivakkam, East Tambaram and Keelkattalai. Ms. Sasikala spent some time at T. Nagar, Saidapet, Kotturpuram, Vadapalani, K.K. Nagar, Koyambedu and Otteri. All the three leaders distributed relief materials to the affected people. Asked about Chief Minister M.K. Stalin’s charge against the previous AIADMK government over flood management, Mr. Panneerselvam replied that the present government should not shirk its responsibility by levelling criticism against its predecessor. “People are expecting the Chief Minister to fulfil his election promises. It ill behoves the government to engage itself in debates or arguments.” Mr. Palaniswami accused the government of “administrative inefficiency” in handling the Chennai floods. He contended that the problem of inundation had not been overcome yet even at Kolathur, the Chief Minister’s constituency. As for the two AIADMK leaders having independent tours, former Villivakkam MLA J.C.D. Prabhakar, who accompanied Mr. Panneerselvam, said such a course of action was justifiable given the gravity of the problem. “The party workers welcome the two leaders enthusiastically and the question of groupism does not arise.” Former Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar, who toured the city along with Mr. Palaniswami, said, “When the coordinator and the co-coordinator are involved in people’s work, it is not proper to see a division in them.” Ms. Sasikala urged the Union Government to release adequate funds to the State for flood relief. She appealed to the State Government to expedite the relief work. AMMK propaganda secretary C.R. Saraswathi, who was with Ms. Sasikala at K.K. Nagar and Kotturpuram, said she decided to take part at the events when she came to know of her visit. “That was the practice when Amma [Jayalalithaa] was alive,” she said, claiming that AMMK and AIADMK workers were there to greet the former interim general secretary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-leaders-sasikala-visit-rain-hit-areas/article37467081.ece

13 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Eye hospital will offer free consultation to diabetics over 50 years of age||As part of World Diabetes Day being observed on Sunday, Dr. Agarwal’s Eye Hospital is offering free consultation to diabetics over the age of 50 until the end of the month. As many as 30% of diabetics in the country develop diabetic retinopathy, which could lead to blindness. Reducing risk A regular annual check and early intervention for vision problems could reduce the risk, said Triveni, cataract surgeon at the hospital. Diabetic retinopathy could lead to abnormal growth of blood vessels in the eye, affecting vision by causing internal bleeding, blocking fluids, damaging the retina and optic nerves and even displacing the retina, she explained. In a country with 80 million diabetics, at least 25 million could have diabetic retinopathy, the specialist said. While persons with Type-1 Diabetes (juvenile diabetes) must get their eyes screened annually, starting from the fifth year of diagnosis, those with Type-2 diabetes must undergo an eye check-up every year after diagnosis. “Symptoms could include blurred vision and floating of dark spots or strings. When these are not treated immediately, it could lead to permanent loss of vision,” Dr. Triveni added. Diabetic retinopathy can be diagnosed through a comprehensive examination of the retina and macula. Various treatments Treatment includes laser surgery to seal leaking blood vessels, injection of medications into the eyes to decrease inflammation, and surgical procedure to remove and replace the gel-like fluid in the back of the eye or to repair a retinal detachment. The world over, 2.5% of all blindness is caused by diabetic retinopathy. In Southeast Asia, about 17% of the population is diabetics. This number is expected to increase to 19% by 2030.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/eye-hospital-will-offer-free-consultation-to-diabetics-over-50-years-of-age/article37467098.ece
13 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||T.N. records 4,014 dengue cases so far||Tamil Nadu has logged 4,014 cases of dengue so far. The highest number of cases was reported in October, considering the rainfall. The month saw a substantial rise in caseload, when compared with the previous two months, as there were 813 cases of the fever. Cases this year are higher than last year’s figures — according to data availed from the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, the State had recorded 2,410 cases of dengue in 2020. At the start of 2021, there were 402 cases in January. The number rose to 618 in February and 684 in March. After a drop, cases resurfaced in July, when there were 123 cases. From 232 cases in August, the figure nearly doubled to 458 in September. This month (till November 10), 326 dengue cases have been reported in the State. Among the health unit districts that have been reporting a higher number of dengue cases recently are Pudukottai, Chengalpattu, Tiruvallur, Erode and Kancheepuram. Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine T.S. Selvavinayagam said the department’s in-built mechanism of daily surveillance of fever cases and dengue cases as well as mosquito control continued. Though challenges existed in dengue prevention and control, he said cases would be brought under control. “We have already activated preventive and control measures,” he said. As of now, 511 people are being treated for dengue in as in-patients. When compared with the last year, the State has tested more samples this year. Till November 10, as many as 1,15,466 samples were tested, as against 33,571 during the same period last year. In Chennai, officials said 105 cases of dengue were recorded from the five sentinel surveillance hospitals since this January. “In the Greater Chennai Corporation limits, domestic breeding checkers are deployed throughout the year,” an official said. He said focus was on controlling adult Aedes mosquitoes, as heavy rain would have washed away eggs and larvae. E. Theranirajan, dean of the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, said an exclusive ward for dengue had been set up at the hospital. He said they were liaising with health inspectors for contact tracing of patients with dengue and identification of areas to take up source reduction. Similarly, hospital workers had been sensitised to identify mosquito breeding places, and mass cleaning efforts had been taken up on campus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-records-4014-dengue-cases-so-far/article37467074.ece

Mobile phones of local officials were constantly ringing in addition to consumer complaints being received through the Minnagam Call Centre. Hundreds of electricity field staff struggled to restore power supply to the lakhs of residents affected by the blackouts. A senior official of the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited (Tangedco) said heavy rain since early morning caused technical snags in hundreds of feeder lines in addition to the snapping of overhead power lines. In several areas, including T. Nagar, West Mambalam, Kodambakkam, Alwarpet and Velachery, power supply was stopped due to knee-deep water stagnation. However, the electricity maintenance staff, disregarding the heavy rain, swung into action from early morning to late night, rectifying electricity faults and re-powering transformers throughout the city.

However, it was extended up to March 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to minutes of a recent SLBC meeting. It said as on August 31, 2021, the digital coverage under savings account was 94% and current account was 70.65% in Virudhunagar. The SLBC said, based on the pilot project experience, the RBI has requested to extend the project to few other districts in Tamil Nadu.

Justice S.M. Subramaniam said the High Court was wrong in having appointed retired district judges and others as Receivers in 1999 to realise the properties owned by the society and settle the dues of the investors. Stating that it was not the business of the High Court to oversee the transactions and grant approval for sale of properties of the society from time to time, The judge directed the government to appoint a Special Officer in the rank of Assistant Inspector General of Registration (AIGR) within three weeks so that the official could take over the administration from the Receiver and ensure return of money at the earliest. The sole Receiver K.R. Hariharan was directed to hand over the entire administration to the Special Officer. The officer would be empowered to get the assistance of all government authorities, the judge said.

Recalling his earlier letter on December 2020 about the pathetic condition of the radar, Mr. Maran called for immediate intervention. “Two of the three radars, currently being used to forecast weather, were out of order just before the heavy rain and consequent flooding on the night of November 6,” he said. The Ministry of Earth Sciences and IMD must accelerate work to repair the radar, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/expedite-radar-repair-maran-writes-to-pm/article37467072.ece

13 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||MDRF opens centre to study monogenic diabetes||The Madras Diabetes Research Foundation (MDRF) has established a Centre for Monogenic Diabetes. It will test genetic samples from children for mutation that could cause diabetes. Foundation chairman Dr. V. Mohan said often even doctors mistook the condition in children to be Type 1 diabetes when they could probably be suffering from a genetic mutation. He said that at least 5% of children could suffer from such mutation. “Monogenic Diabetes refers to forms of diabetes caused by a mutation in a single gene. While there are several forms of monogenic diabetes, the two commonest forms are called maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and neonatal diabetes. MODY affects children or youth, and family history of diabetes can be traced to three or more generations,” he said. There are several subtypes of MODY, and many of these can be controlled with tablets. In such cases, insulin injections can be stopped, and the tablets often work better than insulin, Dr. Mohan said. Dr. Radha Venkatesan, head of genomics at MDRF said, “The centre will use Sanger sequencing, a ‘first generation’ DNA sequencing method, which holds an important place in clinical genomics. It allows doctors to read the human DNA code and understand how particular sequence variations influence the risk of conditions such as monogenic diabetes.” Health Minister Ma. Subramanian inaugurated the Centre virtually. Dr. Mohan said so far 1,492 samples of children had been tested in the centre, and it had helped diagnose the condition accurately. A monogenic diabetes registry was launched to track and study its forms on a long-term basis to understand the genetic patterns in families and to deliver optimal therapies for each patient according to their correct etiology. “We perform genetic testing for patients affected with monogenic forms of diabetes and their families,” Dr. Mohan added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mdrf-opens-centre-to-study-monogenic-diabetes/article37467102.ece

An official of the department said the flyover work at GN Mills was expected to be completed by July next year, as the foundation and pillar construction works were over.  However, there are traffic snarls on the service roads on either side of the 600-metre flyover. In an effort to facilitate smooth movement of vehicles, the encroachments were removed for about 200 metres on Friday and more will be removed in the coming days. Temporary shops The encroachments were mostly temporary shops that had come up on the service roads. There were not many electric poles on the service roads and even what are present will be removed soon. The four-lane flyover is coming up at a total cost of Rs. 30 crore. The Coimbatore District Road Protection Committee, which had announced protests demanding re-laying of the service roads, said it was withdrawing the protests as the Highways Department was taking steps to ease vehicle movement on the stretch at GN Mills on Mettupalayam Road.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/highways-department-removes-encroachments-at-gn-mills/article37467123.ece
13 November 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Vegetable prices shoot up due to drop in arrivals||Prices of vegetables have shot up in Coimbatore in the last one week mainly because of drop in arrivals. The prices are high at the wholesale market and it is difficult to get a lot of vegetable varieties, said Palanisamy, who sells vegetables on his two-wheeler. “Wholesale traders are scared of taking delivery of vegetables as they are not sure if they can sell the entire quantity,” said M. Rajendran, president of the TK Market vegetable traders association. There is a sharp fall in arrivals of vegetables such as bottle gourd, bitter gourd, etc from the villages around Coimbatore. Many of the farmers have suffered crop damage because of the rain. Potato, big onion and small onion are priced at Rs. 40 a kg in the wholesale market, compared to Rs. 20 to Rs. 30 before Deepavali. Carrot costs Rs. 40 a kg, beetroot Rs. 30 a kg, brinjal Rs. 30 to Rs. 60 and drumstick Rs. 120 (wholesale prices). In several markets across the country, workers have not returned after Deepavali. In some, arrivals have reduced because of the rain. Farmers have also suffered crop damages. All these factors have resulted in lesser arrivals to the Coimbatore wholesale market. The daily arrivals are just 30 % of what it used to be before the festival, Mr. Rajendran said. A wholesale onion trader at MGR market added that due to rain there was heavy flow of water into MGR market and vegetables were going waste. This is a matter of concern to the traders, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vegetable-prices-shoot-up-due-to-drop-in-arrivals/article37467142.ece
13 November 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Support sought to promote cotton cultivation in T.N.||The Cotton Development and Research Association of Southern India Mills’ Association (SIMA-CDRA) has sought support from the State and Central governments and the Cotton Corporation of India to promote cultivation of extra long staple cotton varieties among Tamil Nadu farmers. R. Ravichandran, Chairman of SIMA-CDRA, said in a press release that Tamil Nadu produces just five lakh bales of cotton as against the requirement of 120 lakh bales a year by the textile mills in the State. Cotton imports India imports nearly 10 lakh bales of extra long staple cotton and two lakh to three lakh bales of contamination-free cotton involving outflow of $ 640 million a year. Hence, there is a need to boost production of extra long staple cotton. Further, the competitiveness of textile mills in Tamil Nadu eroded in the recent years because of steep increase in transport cost to bring cotton from the growing States. The mills here spend Rs. 3 to Rs. 6 a kg towards transportation of cotton. “ Hence, it has become paramount importance to increase cotton production in Tamil Nadu to sustain the competitiveness of the existing industry,” he said in a press release. A delegation from SIMA-CDRA met Minister for Handloom and Textiles R. Gandhi and senior officials and submitted a proposal to increase cotton production in Tamil Nadu from five lakh bales to 30 lakh bales a year. The Association supplied 200 tonnes of ELS cotton seeds to the farmers in Tamil Nadu for cotton season 2019-2020 under the funding support of the State government through CCI benefiting 50,000 farmers and produced 95,000 bales of high quality ELS cotton. The Association can supply 1,000 tonnes of ELS seeds per year that could cover two lakh hectares, benefit 3.3 lakh farmers and produce six lakh bales per year. The Centre has already notified 40% subsidy for the kapas plucker developed by SIMA-CDRA. The State government should continue 50 % subsidy for the same, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/support-sought-to-promote-cotton-cultivation-in-tn/article37467141.ece

Puram, after a Class XII girl was found dead at her residence in the city on Thursday. The police said that the 17-year-old girl died by suicide at her residence on Thursday evening and the body was taken to Coimbatore Medical College Hospital. However, her parents did not immediately lodge a police complaint. They visited Ukkadam police station on Friday morning and alleged that a teacher in the private school had sexually assaulted the girl multiple times, the sources said.

13 November 2021||Dindigul,TAMIL NADU||‘No transparency in auctioning of shops’||Former Minister and AIADMK MLA Dindigul C. Srinivasan has alleged that Dindigul Corporation officials were not transparent and fair in the auction of shops in Gandhi Market and Kamarajar bus stand here on Friday. Speaking to reporters, he said that the civic authorities had not issued advertisements in leading dailies, a mandatory requirement for public auctioning. The objective was to give wide publicity and thereby earn higher revenue through the highest bidder. However, the authorities were hand-in-glove with the DMK functionaries and were planning to allocate the shops to those identified by them. During the AIADMK regime, the old and dilapidated outlets in Gandhi Maket were demolished and built. Since the model code of conduct came into force, the allocation of shops could not be done. Similarly, during COVID-19 pandemic period, the civic authorities had vacated all the shopkeepers from the Kamarajar bus stand due to the lockdown in force. Under such circumstances, the DMK, after assuming power, attempted to grab the outlets for themselves, Mr Srinivasan alleged and said that the authorities issued the tender forms only to those people directed by the ruling party functionaries and lodged a complaint with the Collector S Visakan to stall the process. Meanwhile, on Friday after the AIADMK men came to know about an auction taking place for Gandhi Market shops, they staged a sit-in agitation in front of the office of the Commissioner at the Corporation building and also met the Commissioner. High drama prevailed since 11 a.m. as there was chaos. As the news spread, when media persons visited, they were informed that the auction was under way. However, officials said that Corporation Commissioner Sivasubramanian had gone out to oversee the arrangements for travel of conservancy workers from Dindigul to Chennai for deputation purpose. An official source in the Corporation said that the tender was being conducted in a ‘fair and free’ manner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-transparency-in-auctioning-of-shops/article37467203.ece

Raja, Nilgiris MP, to take steps to appoint more teachers and also construct additional classrooms in the school. Mr. Raja inaugurated a smart classroom on the school premises on Thursday that was constructed using the MP Local Area Development Scheme fund. Committee president G. Sumithra and others submitted petitions to the MP stating that the school was functioning with two students in 2018 and was on the verge of closure. But, efforts taken by the committee members led to an increase in strength to 90. However, the school has only one teacher and one more vacancy needs to be filled. Also, steps should be taken to create one teacher post, the petition said. The petition also said that currently the school has only two classrooms which are insufficient to cater to the needs of the students. Since, a classroom was converted to a smart classroom, accommodating all the 90 students in one class is very difficult. Hence, constructing three more classrooms would benefit the students and also help in more admissions in the coming year, the petition said. The petition also wanted the school to be upgraded as an elementary school as students have to travel to other villages to get admissions for Cass VI. S.C. Natraj, director, Service Unit for Development Activities in Rural, an NGO, and other members were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/appoint-more-teachers-to-primary-school/article37467221.ece

13 November 2021||Hyderabad,TAMIL NADU||Stepwell in Qutb Shahi tombs complex restored||In the marvellous garden of a stucco work necropolis of the Qutb Shahi tombs, it is a deep stepwell of dressed granite. While curvy flowy lines and stucco decorations are the norm in the tombs complex, the stepwell is all about straight lines and minimalistic design. Recently restored to the way it appears in archival images from 19th century by the Department of Archaeology and Museums, the effort has been aided by the U.S. Ambassador’s Fund for Cultural Preservation. “It is probably one of the earliest structures here, along with the Idgah and might pre-date the necropolis. The other boalis [ stepwells] are built on rocky outcrops. This one is built into the earth with huge blocks of hand-dressed stone blocks and masonry,” says Ratish Nanda of the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, which is working in coordination with the Telangana Government to restore the tombs complex. The Qutb Shahis ruled the Golconda kingdom between 1518 and 1687. The challenges Restoring a deep stepwell presents its own challenges. “Portions of the stone blocks had bulged out and required to be reset; this was dangerous due to the depth of the baoli . We also needed to channelise rainwater into it, requiring extensive restoration of earth levels all around out,” says Mr. Nanda. A photograph clicked during the restoration work shows the intimidating depth of the well and dealing with large blocks of dressed stones that needed to be moved around. Above the ground, large blocks of the stones were also displaced as the well was not in use for a long time. The well reaches to the depth of 20 metres or about 60 feet — the same height as a six-storey structure. The Idgah baoli is among the seven wells inside the Qutb Shahi tombs complex that are being restored as part of the conservation efforts at the site. Recently, speaking at a seminar, Special Chief Secretary Arvind Kumar had spelled out the State Government’s plans for revival of stepwells in the city. “Hyderabad had 140-plus stepwells. Most of them have disappeared; we are rediscovering. We have repaired and restored 12 stepwells. Corporates are eager to be involved in the restoration. Once restored, they will be part of history and heritage of the city and we will ensure some meaningful activities take place in those areas,” said Mr. Kumar at the Maulana Azad National Urdu University here.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stepwell-in-qutb-shahi-tombs-complex-restored/article37466901.ece
13 November 2021||IDUKKI,TAMIL NADU||Water levels rising in Idukki, Mullaperiyar||After a lull, the water level in the Mullaperiyar and Idukki dams is rising following heavy rainfall from Thursday night. The district administration on Friday issued an orange alert in the wake of the water level in the Idukki reservoir crossing 2,398.03 ft. The water level in the Mullaperiyar dam, which has been almost steady for the past few days, rose to 139.10 ft on Friday with increased inflow and the tunnel discharge being reduced to 467 cusecs. The inflow was 3,967 cusecs at 3 p.m. The Vaigai dam storing water from the Mullaperiyar dam was opened two days ago following heavy rainfall in Tamil Nadu. The water level in the Idukki reservoir had fallen on Thursday to the blue alert level from orange alert, as per the new rule curve fixed by the Central Water Commission. However, following good inflow, the level increased to 2,398.2 ft on Friday morning. Releasing of water Collector Sheeba George said the level in the reservoir would be limited by releasing water, if needed. If rain continued at the present level, the Cheruthoni dam shutters may be opened on Saturday after 4 p.m. or on Sunday morning to release up to 100 cusecs. As per the new rule curve, the red alert level is 2,399.03 ft and the upper rule curve 2,400.03 ft. (The full reservoir level is 2,403 ft). A dam safety official said the new rule curve in the Idukki reservoir had come into force on Thursday. Impact of release The release of a small quantum of water would not have much impact downstream as arrangements were already in place as the dam shutters had been raised last month. In case of a decline in rainfall, the chances of opening of the shutters were remote. However, opening of the shutters of the Cheruthoni dam would be considered if water was released from the Mullaperiyar dam and there was heavy inflow into the Idukki reservoir. He said power generation at the Moolamattom power plant was at the maximum and the discharge to the Kulamavu dam was also high, which reduced the chances of opening the Cheruthoni shutters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/water-levels-rising-in-idukki-mullaperiyar/article37466905.ece
13 November 2021||Kodaikanal,TAMIL NADU||‘Elephants enter villages, damage crops’||Farmers in upper Kodaikanal, including Keezhamalai, Anju Veedu and Pethupaarai areas have been complaining about elephant movement inside their villages for the last one week. Submitting a memorandum to Collector S Visakan on Friday, they said that several reminders to the Forest Department authorities had not fetched any desired result so far. “We have been asking them to chase the elephants into forests. Our crops including mango and guava orchards and plantain crops have been destroyed,” they claimed. In the recent past, about 100 acres of standing crops and fruits have been destroyed. Some of the dwellings and storage rooms in the fields have been damaged by the elephants, they stated in the petition. Their foremost appeal was to chase the elephants and secondly they demanded compensation for the loss and sought a permanent solution from the wild animal’s threat. A senior official in the Forest Department said that herds of elephants camping was common during rainy days. Chasing them away may not be possible. “Probably, we can work out modalities on how to prevent loss of lives and crops,” he added. The Collector said that he would get officials from the Horticulture Department to inspect the crops and ascertain the loss within a week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/elephants-enter-villages-damage-crops/article37467201.ece

When a SETC bus, attached to the Nagercoil depot, reached the Kayathar toll plaza at 4 a.m. on Friday, the bus was stopped by the personnel there as the SETC administration had failed to recharge the toll for the bus in FASTag, the National Highways Authority of India’s electronic toll collection system. As the bus crew contacted the depot officials immediately in a bid to resolve the crisis to ensure hassle-free travel of the passengers, they were informed that the online payment towards the toll for the bus could be made only after Depot Manager came to the office after 10 a.m. Meanwhile, four more buses, also attached to the Nagercoil depot, reached the Kayathar toll plaza within next 20 minutes only to be stopped there for non-payment of toll. Subsequently, the stranded passengers were sent to Nagercoil in other buses even as the detained passenger vehicles were parked there. Only after online recharge of the toll was made after 10 a.m., the buses were allowed to cross the point after 5-hour-long detention.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/buses-stopped-at-toll-plaza/article37467180.ece

13 November 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Water to be released in 58-canal system today||The State government has announced that water will be released under the 58-village canal system on Saturday, according to Minister for Commercial Taxes and Registration P. Moorthy. Speaking to reporters at the Collectorate here on Friday after presiding over a review meeting, co-chaired by Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan and other elected representatives, he said that following representations from farmers’ associations, the government had decided to release 150 cusecs of water. This would benefit farmers in Usilampatti and surrounding pockets. PWD engineers said that the surplus water stored in the Vaigai dam would be released under the 58-village canal system, which would feed water for irrigation to over 3000 acres of land. The AIADMK had recently appealed to the government to release water under the canal system since the water level in the Vaigai dam had crossed 67 feet. However, Mr. Moorthy said that the government had to examine various modalities before the announcement. There was no delay and the purpose should benefit the stakeholders. He said that the recent spell had not affected Madurai much as about 10 hectares of land had been damaged due to water stagnation. Accompanied by Collector S. Aneesh Shekhar, senior IAS officer T.N. Venkatesh, who is the Monitoring Officer for Madurai district, Corporation Commissioner K.P. Karthikeyan, the Minister said that they visited a few waterbodies and discussed the steps to be taken in the event of any breach or surplus. Apart from keeping the machinery and men in ready, Mr. Moorthi said that they had also planned to shift people to relief centres, wherever it was required. There were representations from farmers to evict encroachments from canals and waterbodies, he said, adding that it would be done on a warfooting. He said that after a long number of years, the coverage area in Melur and Kottampatti blocks was expected to expand as the water conserved would enable the farmers to carry on with their farm activities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/water-to-be-released-in-58-canal-system-today/article37467587.ece
13 November 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Start AIIMS without any more delay’||The Union government should immediately take steps to commence the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on a rented premises, said members of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) here on Friday. A two-day 23rd Madurai district CPI (M) conference was inaugurated here on Friday where speakers insisted on the AIIMS to be commenced here without any more delay. A resolution passed at the conference condemned the Union government for its undue delay. Only after repeated pressures and agitations from the Opposition parties, the Centre had finally taken a step forward by signing an agreement with the JICA. Though the foundation stone was laid in as early as 2019 by the Prime Minister, in the last 24 months, nothing tangible had moved in. As a result, the project had got delayed for various political reasons. In a bid to ensure that the delay was minimised at least from now onwards, the Union government should give its nod for commencement of the AIIMS on rented premises as waiting for the entire construction to get over in the next three to four years may be too long a wait. State executive committee member S. Noor Mohamed, Madurai MP Su Venkatesan, Madurai district secretary S. Vijayrajan and others spoke. The second day event would be held on Saturday where speakers would discuss the present scenario and the urban local bodies election, the organisers said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/start-aiims-without-any-more-delay/article37467583.ece

13 November 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Plea alleges illegal fee collection in markets||The Madurai Bench of Madras High Court has sought response from the authorities on a public interest litigation petition that has alleged an illegal collection of fee at the daily and the weekly markets of the Usilampatti Panchayat Union. A Division Bench of Justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P. Velmurugan ordered notice on the petition filed by V.P. Ammavasai of Usilampatti in the district. He alleged that the fee collection was taking place without licence for over seven years. Ammavasai, an elected ward member of the Usilampatti Panchayat Union, said that the licence for the collection of fee from the shopkeepers, vehicles entering the market, for cattle and other vendors was granted to private persons through a public auction in 2007. The licence was granted for four years and was valid till 2011. Subsequently, a resolution was passed by the Usilampatti Panchayat Union and the licence was extended to a further three years till 2014. It was clear that the licence had expired in 2014, but still the same persons were collecting the fee. No steps have been taken to stop the irregularities and the illegal collection of fees was still continuing. It has caused revenue loss to the Usilampatti Panchayat Union. Therefore, the illegal collection of fees should be stopped and the money recovered, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-alleges-illegal-fee-collection-in-markets/article37467588.ece

A Division Bench of Justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P. Velmurugan sought response on the petition filed by M. Rajendrasethupathy of Alangudi. The petitioner sought direction to the authorities to remove the encroachment from Periyathalkulam. He said Periyathalkulam was one of the biggest waterbodies in the region and three villages — Senthangudi, Nagaram and Keeramangalam north — were dependent on the waterbody for agricultural activities and other basic needs. But, the waterbody was encroached upon. The courts have repeatedly directed authorities to remove encroachment and protect them. Despite several orders, authorities were not removing the encroachment, he said. A government order was issued in 2014 stating that encroachments would be removed by a committee within 30 days of receiving complaints. He said that he had made a representation. But, no steps were taken, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-to-remove-encroachments-from-waterbody/article37467173.ece

13 November 2021||Nagercoil,TAMIL NADU||Encroachments on waterbodies wreak havoc in Kanniyakumari||Encroachments on waterbodies, failure on the part of the authorities to periodically desilt rivers and irrigation tanks and conversion of wetlands into housing plots have wreaked havoc in Kanniyakumari district, particularly in the northern region. Water has entered hundreds of acres of paddy fields, coconut and banana groves and submerged the crops. Water flowing through the main thoroughfare has eroded the roads and cut off villages from one another. Public transport is not being operated beyond Erachakulam, a village in the region. “There are 385 tanks that function as shock absorbers by collecting the heavy water flowing from the nearby hills and forest areas. They are either encroached or not maintained,” said P. Chenbagasekaran Pillai, a farmer from Thuvarangadu said.  Water has entered villages and houses which was unheard of two decades ago. New settlements and independent houses on paddy fields have borne the brunt of the rain. “As per the A-register of the Erachakulam revenue village, there are 37 ponds in and around the village. Now I can find only 15 of them. Where is the rest? Where will the water go when there is no place to absorb the water,” asked N. Kaliappan, joint secretary of Vishwa Hindu Parishad’s South Tamil Nadu unit. He said the pathetic condition of Palayar or Pakruliyar of Sangam yore could explain the callous attitude of the government towards waterbodies in the district. “Instead of removing encroachments, the PWD is leasing out coconut plantations on the banks of the river. Does it not amount to legally approving encroachments,” asked Mr. Kaliappan.  Vambar, a small river near Therisanancope, is in spate and has flooded paddy fields, coconut and banana crops cultivated on its banks. “Even in the 1990s, I had seen a bullock cart moving through its bank. Now you cannot ride a bicycle. Its condition speaks volumes about encroachments,” said T. Jayapal, who is running an oil press.   One of the major issues that have contributed to the inundation is conversion of wetlands into housing plots, despite a prohibitive order by the Collector. “There is a pressure on those who have lands on the roadside to sell. Once the land is in their possession, the real estate sharks prevent passage to others who own land beyond the roadside area. Other owners then follow suit. This is how the paddy fields are gobbled up,” said V. Umaiyorubhagan, former Professor of Chemistry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/encroachments-wreak-havoc-in-kanniyakumari/article37467218.ece

13 November 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||New check dam to be built across Sankarabarani: L-G||Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan on Friday said a new check dam would be constructed at Pillayarkuppam-Sellipet across the Sankarabarani river. The Lt. Governor who visited Oussudu lake and Pillayarkuppam anicut across the Sankarabarani, to assess the flood situation, told media persons that the existing French-era anicut, built around 120 years ago, had some issues and hence efforts were being taken to build a new check dam. However, work on the new structure cannot be commenced until water levels recede, she said. The Lt. Governor’s visit to the anicut followed rapid filling up of the major freshwater lakes, such as Oussudu and Bahour in the heavy rain over the past few days that prompted the PWD to begin releasing water to safeguard residential units in the vicinity. According to Ms. Soundararajan, work would be initiated during summer. The authorities have made arrangements to build a new dam with a visionary plan. “I have seen the map of the plan. The project would be expedited in consultation with the Chief Minister,” she said. Conservation plans Public Works Secretary A. Vikranth Raja briefed the Lt. Governor on the efforts being made by the government to conserve water and maintain major lakes like the one at Oussudu, which being a bird sanctuary, warranted an approach different to regular conservation plan for waterbodies. The Lt. Governor said there were plans to develop the Sellippattu-Pillaiyarkuppam basin dam and the Oussudu Lake into a tourist attraction with a ramp-up of amenities. She noted that implementation of several tourism development plans had suffered a setback due to the direction of efforts towards getting the COVID-19 situation under control. Now, with a relative easing of the pandemic situation and with the return of tourists, the schemes would be put back on track in consultation with the Chief Minister, she also said. Ms. Soundararajan reiterated her appeal to the unvaccinated residents to get the jab against COVID-19.  Work will be initiated during summer. I have seen the the plan.

13 November 2021||PUDUKOTTAI,TAMIL NADU||Villagers wade through channel to carry dead man to cremation ground||Residents of Keezha Paluvanchi, Mela Paluvanchi and Seynthamangalam in Annavasal panchayat union in Pudukottai district face a tough time carrying the dead as they have to wade through water in a supply channel to reach the burial ground on the other side of the waterbody. On Thursday, a group of residents of the Keezha Paluvanchi village had to struggle to carry the body of an aged man on a bamboo pier, while walking through neck-deep water in the supply channel due to heavy rain over the past few days. Carrying the corpse, laid on the bamboo pier, on their shoulder, the group faced the daunting task of having to carefully wade through the flowing water to reach the other side where the cremation ground is situated. This is the scenario every time the supply channel gets filled up due to heavy downpour during the monsoon as there is no alternative route to the cremation ground, the villagers say. The three villages are separated by short distances and fall under the Kothandaramapuram panchayat. They have their respective burial grounds, situated on ‘poromboke’ lands on the other side of the supply channel that feeds the Kavinadu tank, which is the largest in the district. Repeated representations from these villagers to the respective governments over the years about their plight in carrying the dead to the cremation ground and seeking a permanent solution by way of construction of a bridge have only fallen on deaf ears. The situation has remained the same, says M. Govindarajan, 54, a union councillor and a resident of Seynthamangalam. No alternative route With no alternative route to reach the cremation grounds for these three villages, the only permanent solution is constructing a bridge across the channel, Mr. Govindarajan said. Further, villagers have to take their goats for grazing to the other side of the waterbody, he says, adding that this becomes difficult when the channel fills up. Construction of a bridge across the channel would also help residents in reaching Peraiyur soon as it would serve as a shorter route instead of taking a detour of about 12 km, says Mr. Govindarajan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/villagers-wade-through-channel-to-carry-dead-man-to-cremation-ground/article37467111.ece

Periasami here on Friday. Participating at a meeting in the Collectorate, presided over by Collector K. V. Muralidharan, he reviewed the rain situation and the development works being undertaken in the district. Later, he told reporters that the DMK would never give up the rights of the people of Tamil Nadu and the Chief Minister was very clear on the issue. “Do not believe the statements of some outfits or political parties, who are determined to create confusion. Mr Stalin will take up the issue with the Kerala government at an appropriate time,” he said. The Supreme Court had given a set of directions. Both Tamil Nadu and Kerala governments have followed them, he said and added that the visit of Ministers (from Kerala government) to the Mullaperiyar dam cannot be questioned. The State government would not deviate in any manner from the diktats of the apex court, he added. The Minister said that some people in the AIADMK indulged in spreading rumours about the Mullaperiyar storage level. The farmers can be assured that Mr. Stalin would not let them down and would take all out efforts to raise the water level to 152 ft ultimately in the interest of the five southern districts.

13 November 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||T.N. seeks time for farmers to insure samba, thaladi crop||The Tamil Nadu Government has requested the Union Government to extend the last date for premium payment for insuring the samba or thaladi paddy crop, Minister for Cooperation I. Periyasamy said at Tiruvarur on Friday. The request came after farmers demanded that the last date be extended from November 15 to the month-end, arguing that the cultivation had not been completed yet in the Cauvery delta and the heavy rainfall had caused them hardships. Mr. Periyasamy, who led a team of Ministers to inspect the inundated crops in the delta districts on Friday, said the primary agricultural cooperative societies would function on Saturday and Sunday to enable farmers to pay the premium. Ministers Thangam Thennarasu (Industries), K.R. Periakaruppan (Rural Development), S. Reghupathy (Law), R. Sakkarapani (Food and Civil Supplies), Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi (School Education), and Siva V. Meyyanathan (Environment) formed part of the team that inspected the inundated fields in Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Mayiladuthurai and Nagapattinam districts. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin will inspect the inundation of crops in the delta districts on Saturday. 33% damage In Thanjavur district, 4,086 hectares of paddy has been inundated. Of this, the crop on 41.05 hectares has suffered more than 33% damage. Steps are being taken to drain the water from the fields to save the crops. The samba/thaladi crop has been raised on about 1.13 lakh hectares in the district against the targetted 1.26 lakh hectares. Mr. Periyasamy urged farmers to insure their crop without fail and directed officials of the Departments of Agriculture and Cooperation to work in coordination to disburse farm inputs and credit to farmers as soon as the water receded. The Minister said the samba/thaladi crop raised on about 17,000 hectares had been inundated in Tiruvarur. Interacting with the team, farmers representatives demanded that the full extent of the damage be enumerated and the affected farmers given compensation. Losses in Nagapattinam Cauvery S. Dhanapalan, president, Tamil Nadu Vivasaya Sangankalin Kootiyakkam, told the team that the samba crop was less than 60 days old and farmers had suffered more than 50% crop losses in Nagapattinam district. He urged the team to consider 33% damage to the crops as ‘full damage’ and grant compensation accordingly. V. Jeevakumar, vice-president, Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam, Thanjavur, emphasised the need for desilting the drainage canals in the delta. “There are more than 29,800 canals in the delta districts and they should be cleared of silt on a war footing. The crops are getting damaged as farmers are unable to drain the rainwater. We also sought weedicides and cono-weeders at subsidised rates. Availability of fertilizers should be ensured,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-seeks-time-for-farmers-to-insure-samba-thaladi-crop/article37467113.ece
13 November 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Inundation will stop only when there is no encroachment||The inundation of residential colonies in low-lying areas Tiruchi due to heavy discharge in the Koraiyar this week has turned the spotlight back on encroachments of drainage channels, the city’s primary storm water drainage network apart from Kudamuritti river. Allaying apprehensions of the possibility of yet another flood, Collector S. Sivarasu, however, conceded that unapproved layouts and encroachments on drainage canals and wetlands (nanjai lands) have led to the inundation. Retrieving the canals after the rains will be the permanent solution, he told media persons.  A recurrent problem Flooding of low-lying areas has been a recurrent phenomenon since the late 1990s due to rapid urbanisation around Karumandapam along Dindigul highway, Vayalur Road, Kuzhumani Road, Chinthamani area, Woraiyur and other places. Poor maintenance of the network of open drains that serve as storm water drains to discharge the rainwater into the Cauvery have made the problem acute. A network of canals, which had once served as irrigation channels, has been serving as the main storm water drains in recent decades. The Thennur Rettai Vaical, Kathirikai, Kathan, Kottai, Virupachipuram, Vannarapettai, Kathan, Thotti, Devadhanam, Tharanallur and several other canals have almost turned into massive open drainages and also carry rainwater into the Cauvery. Many of these canals have been heavily encroached upon - some of the 15-25 feet wide ones have been reduced to just three to five feet. In places such as Chinthamani and Vayalur Road, padugai lands have been encroached upon and converted into residential colonies. Only a contour canal The Kudamuritti river, which originates near Puthur Aqueduct, carries the surplus or flood discharges from Koraiyar and Uyyakondan rivers to the Cauvery. It is a contour canal which does not have a bund on its left side. This arrangement was meant to allow the flood waters to head up whenever the Cauvery was in spate and drain when the flow subsides. Now, residential colonies and even educational institutions have come up close to the canal’s left flank. A flood prevention project implemented over a decade back failed to address these issues, residents observe. “Nothing prevents the authorities from evicting encroachments, but they do not act,” rues a resident of Srinivasa Nagar. “The city has a network of canals which serve as storm water drains. The Corporation and Public Works Department have, over the years, turned a blind eye to encroachments and shrinkage of the canals. This has resulted in several areas remaining under water for over four days now. It is a health hazard too. The civic body, the PWD and the district administration should get their act together to remove all encroachments from drainage canals ruthlessly to bring about a permanent solution to the recurrent problem,” said K.Suresh, former city secretary, Communist Party of India. Map the places “The authorities can easily map places where inundation is common and come up with appropriate remedial measures. There is no proper planning or inclination. They have been talking about removal of encroachments for years,” observes S. Pushpavanam, secretary, Consumer Protection Council, Tamil Nadu. “Pre-monsoon preventive measures, including proper maintenance of the underground drainage, should be carried out in right earnest,” says S. Sundararaju of Srinivasa Nagar South.  There is no proper planning or inclination, and they have been talking about encroachment removal for years S.

13 November 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Efforts on to drain water from tank||Tiruchi corporation has started work to drain excess water from the Kottapattu Periyakulam which is filled to the brim. Rainwater collected in the waterbody had flowed into the Anna Science Centre - Planetarium and surrounding localities of J. K. Nagar and Khajamalai were at risk of inundation. On Friday afternoon, corporation and revenue officials inspected the Kottaipattinam Periyakulam in an attempt to map out a drainage channel. Local activists criticised the authorities who had blocked various means for the excess water to drain and notified the area as revenue land years ago. Two earthmovers belonging to the Corporation dug up a few places around the tank to locate pipelines. But later the embankment was cut to allow the water to flow into a vacant land behind the Aavin Processing unit on Pudukottai Road. “This is only a temporary measure. We will work out a permanent solution soon,” a revenue official said. The waterbody, which once spanned over 100 acres, has been reduced to at least one-fourth of its size, he added. Meanwhile, over five days after some parts of the city became inundated due to incessant rains, water slowly began to drain out. At Linga Nagar, one of the worst-affected areas, residents had to compel officials to visit and sanction measures, they said. Problems of stench from the water mixing with sewage pipelines, slush on roads were now before them. “We pooled in money and put gravel and sand on roads so our vehicles could go. We do not have the funds to do it again,” they said. Collector S. Sivarasu inspected waterbodies that were filling up due to the rains in Manikandam and Manapparai blocks. At these sites, he met officials of the local administration, enquired about the inflow and discharge of water from the waterbodies and instructed them to take necessary safety and security measures. Karur MP S. Jyothimani, revenue, highways officials took part in the inspection of tanks in Manapparai area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/efforts-on-to-drain-water-from-tank/article37467195.ece

13 November 2021||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||49 tanks get inflow of water after 30 years||Forty-nine irrigation tanks, which remained largely dry for over 30 years due to encroachment of the irrigation channels, have received water from the Hanuman river, thanks to the efforts taken by the district administration to remove man-made obstacles at various places along the 39 km-long watercourse of the river. This operation has resurrected farming operation on over 10,000 acres after a gap of 30 years. Collector V. Vishnu, after visiting a number of systemised and non-systemised waterbodies in the first week of July, came out with the plan (Tirunelveli Water Resources). The objective was to rejuvenate the ponds and the irrigation tanks with public participation. Besides digitizing every information pertaining to the waterbodies, steps were taken to ensure free flow of water into these irrigation tanks and ponds by desilting the neglected irrigation channels and removing illegal structures obstructing the flow of water into these waterbodies. Mr. Vishnu, after getting information about the 49 irrigation tanks that do not get water from the Hanuman river due to clogged irrigation channels and encroachments, inspected the river course from Senchatti check-dam near Kuththarapaanjaan Falls, its origin point in the Western Ghats, to Panchattikulam, the last irrigation tank of the Hanuman river irrigation system and ascertained the reasons behind the problem. “Since all the channels associated with this irrigation system remained choked with tonnes of silt and debris and the channels had been encroached upon by individuals at various places, steps were taken to remove all the obstacles,” says Mr. Vishnu. A team, led by Radhapuram Tahsildar A. Yesurajan was formed to start both desilting and eviction drive. In some places, farmers who have their coconut groves close to the watercourse had illegally occupied the river itself by planting coconut trees beyond their boundaries. In a few other places, the windmill companies had illegally formed temporary roads across the watercourse thereby diverting the water. When the work started, the Kanjippaarai and Sooravali check-dams, which were built when K. Kamaraj was the Chief Minister to divert water from the Western Ghats to the Hanuman river via Senchatti check-dam near Panagudi, were strengthened and renovated. Backed by ‘Nam Hanuman river Movement’ volunteers, desilting of 36 km-long watercourse was completed before the onset of northeast monsoon. Now, the channels branching out from the main watercourse to the irrigation tanks are being desilted. The desilting of the main channel has ensured flow of water into 38 of the 49 tanks, all getting water from the Hanuman river. Of this, 33 irrigation tanks are overflowing after the desilting operation and five tanks have 75% water. “Work on taking water to the remaining 11 irrigation tanks is going on. We will ensure the overflow of all 49 tanks under Hanuman river irrigation system this year by desilting every bit of the irrigation channels,” assures Mr. Yesurajan. The farmers of Hanuman river irrigation system are happy now. “All these 49 irrigation tanks were getting water only through wild streams whenever it rained heavily in this region in the past. After 30 long years, this irrigation system has been resurrected by the Collector and his team of officials,” says Murugan, president of Vaeppillankulam village panchayat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/49-tanks-get-inflow-of-water-after-30-years/article37467211.ece

13 November 2021||VELLORE,TAMIL NADU||Marooned residents in Vellore rescued||Marooned residents from low-lying areas along the Bengaluru Highway in Vellore were rescued by the Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services on Friday. More than 20 persons from Thideer Nagar, Kansalpet, Indira Nagar, Periyar Nagar and Konavattam were accommodated in temporary shelters. These localities, to the rear of the Vellore Fort, were flooded after lakes, including Sathupueri, Otteri and Sitheri, breached in the rain that lashed the district since last week.

Kumaravel Pandian inspected the affected areas, including Thiruvalam, Melpadi, Poonai Anaicut and Vellore Wholesale Mango Santy near the Nicollas Canal along the highway. Permanent solution “Desilting of the canal and its drains is the permanent solution. Every monsoon, our houses and shops get flooded,” said P. Mani, 72, president, Vellore Wholesale Mango Association. With the discharge of excess water from the Kalavagunta dam in Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh and the inflow from the tributaries of the Ponnai, 15,000 cusecs and 15,851 cusecs was released from the Poonai and Palar anaicuts respectively. As a result, the Vellore and Ranipet Collectors have issued a flood alert for 22 villages along these rivers. Friday’s flood alert was the fifth one since October 1. Affected villages include K.N.

Bhaskara Pandian told The Hindu . Crops damaged The crops, mainly paddy, standing on 55.55 hectares in Vellore, 134 hectares in Ranipet and 34.47 hectares in Tirupattur have been damaged. Agricultural areas like Arcot, Nemili, Sholinghur, Gudiyatham, Katpadi, Anaicut, Natrampalli, Tirupattur, Kandali are the most affected due to rains. Around 500 marginal farmers have been affected in these districts. In Tirupattur, three bridges at Pudupet, Katteri and Pambaru have been damaged. Traffic was diverted after boulders rolled off the Yelagiri Hills and damaged the roads in the hills. Collector Amar Kushwaha inspected the farmers’ market at Tirupattur, which was damaged. So far, 249 affected persons, including 23 children, have been taken to two government shelters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/marooned-residents-in-vellore-rescued/article37467241.ece

13 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BBMP making calls to citizens hesitating to take second dose||Civic health workers and officials have started to observe an inexplicable trend: many people who received their first shot of the COVID-19 vaccine seem to be either reluctant to take the second dose, or are delaying it. In an attempt to nip this problem in the bud, the BBMP is resorting to making calls to citizens to remind them to get their shot in time. BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta said that though vaccine coverage in the city has been a big achievement, there is a need to improve it further. “There is a 12-week gap between the first and second dose. Some people, who are eligible for the second dose, are not coming forward. To overcome this, the BBMP’s call centre and the 141 PHCs are calling eligible persons and urging them to get their second shot,” he said. In Bengaluru, over 1.33 crore people have got at least one dose. While 87% have received the first dose, only 59% have received both doses. According to the BBMP’s COVID-19 reports, 75% of people aged between 18 and 44 have received the first dose, while only 46% in the same age category have got the second dose. A similar trend has been observed among citizens above 45 years. While over 96% of people in this category have received the first dose, only 73% have received both doses. Responding to a question on vaccine mandates that is in place in a few countries across the world, including the U.S. and Singapore, Mr. Gupta explained that in these countries, only the vaccinated population is allowed in public places, while those unvaccinated have restrictions. “There has been no discussion on introducing such vaccine mandates here,” he said. He, however, said the number of COVID-19 positive cases was averaging around 140 a day. “The numbers should decrease further and citizens must follow COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. Those who develop symptoms should get tested. We have good medical infrastructure in place,” he added. Dengue cases With intermittent rain, the BBMP is also gearing up to tackle the vector-borne disease dengue, which is spread through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito. The mosquito can be recognised by the white marking on its legs and breeds only in stagnant, fresh water. “The BBMP is also taking up several measures to check the spread of the disease,” said Mr. Gupta.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bbmp-making-calls-to-citizens-hesitating-to-take-second-dose/article37467022.ece
13 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Eighteen months on, staff give thumbs up to work from home||Eighteen months is ample time for people to decide whether they prefer working from home or commuting to office every day. And the verdict is out: pulse surveys conducted by many IT, ITeS, and financial services companies prior to chalking out a back-to-work plan has revealed that most people – parents to even young millennials – are keen on working remotely. Having had a taste of the flexibility that it offers, software engineer Saurabh Vyas plumped for remote work when his company sought to know where he would like to work out of office, home, or a combination. Over the last 18 months, Mr. Vyas switched between Bengaluru and his hometown Udaipur. The arrangement boosted his productivity. It also provided him the space to be with his elderly parents and be a more ‘present’ father to his son. When the family shifted back to Udaipur, he found that his five-year-old required fewer visits to the doctor on account of respiratory illness, which was a bane when the family stayed in Bengaluru. “My son’s offline classes have begun but we have opted for online classes. Our office is not in a hurry to bring us back to the campus,” said Mr. Vyas. A study by Dell Technologies last year found that a majority of employees in India were keen on working remotely for the long term, provided they had access to the right technology and received sufficient human resources support. Work from home is clearly gaining more ground by the day. To cater to the increasing demand for a flexible working environment, LinkedIn recently launched tools to help job seekers highlight flexible work preferences and also learn about workplace policies. For many employees with parental responsibilities, work from home has worked like a charm and they want it to continue ad infinitum . Reine Varghese and a majority of her team members exercised the permanent remote work option when her technology MNC offered the option last year. She has no plans to return to her workplace. “Before COVID-19, I would wake up at 6 a.m. and attend to a laundry list of domestic responsibilities before dashing off to work,” she said. “I am able to spend more time with my daughter as I don’t waste two to three hours on my commute,” said Ms. Varghese. Many startups and medium-sized companies with a younger workforce have taken a remote-first or fully-remote approach based on feedback collected from employees. When Bengaluru-based startup KonfHub took an internal survey, they were surprised to see that only three of their 23 employees wanted to be back in the cabin. “And that included me and my co-founder, so there was no point in investing in office space,” said founder Ganesh Samarthyam. They decided to give up their space on Outer Ring Road. “A majority of our employees are in their 20s. Besides the comfort of working from their hometown, not having to commute makes remote work attractive to them,” he added. The arrangement has helped the company, so far. “We were able to grow fast as recruitment was easy. But, we are still discussing whether to continue remote work or investing in a space to meet occasionaly,” said Mr. Samarthyam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/eighteen-months-on-staff-give-thumbs-up-to-work-from-home/article37467039.ece
13 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC imposes Rs. 6 lakh cost on scribe for abusing process of court, law||The High Court of Karnataka has imposed a cost of Rs. 6 lakh on a journalist for abusing process of the court and misusing law as an instrument of fraud and harassment to seek allotment of a government-built house that he was in illegal occupation from the past 21 years. “No allotment can be claimed by a person who gains entry to the public property by hooliganism and continue in its occupation, on the mere ground that he belongs to oppressed class of society... This cannot be permitted to continue,” the court observed. Justice Krishna S. Dixit passed the order while dismissing the petition filed by 42-year-old G.M. Mahadeva, a resident of Mysuru, who claimed himself as the editor and publisher of ‘Rashtrakraanthi’ newspaper, and state president of the Association of Small and Medium Newspapers of India. ‘Militant lie’ On his claim that he had, in the year 2000, occupied the house, built by the Urban Development Department in Mysuru, based on “the verbal assurance given by the then engineers,” the court said it “is a militant lie to say the least” as he, despite opportunity given by the court, had not provided names or any particulars of engineers who “verbally” allowed him to reside in the house. Noticing that the petitioner had claimed that he belongs to a Scheduled Caste, the court said he had not produced any materials to substantiate claim on his caste but had harassed high-ranking officials by unjustifiably dragging them to the State and the national commissions for SCs, and the Karnataka State Human Rights Commission. “Assuming that he belongs to that community, no right would accrue in his favour for gaining entry to the house that admittedly belongs to the government and meant for being allotted to the genuine and eligible members of the oppressed communities,” the court said. As the petitioner had contested elections, the court observed that “he is not naïve to the publiclife and public morality, to justify his seeking protection at the hands of SC/ST commission or this court. In fact, such persons spoil the social image of oppressed classes, and happening of such things should be oppressed by the iron hand of the court”. “Constitutional jurisdiction of this court cannot be permitted to be invoked by the unscrupulous persons like the petitioner. If persons of this kind are granted relief at the hands of this court, the makers of the Constitution would shiver in their graves...,” the court observed while directing the authorities to evict and prosecute the petitioner and other illegal occupants of the houses built for genuine beneficiaries in Mysuru. The petitionerhas to pay an additional cost of Rs. 1,000 per day if he fails to pay Rs. 6 lakh to the Government within six weeks, the court said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-imposes-rs-6-lakh-cost-on-scribe-for-abusing-process-of-court-law/article37467042.ece
13 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Collect only 85% fees for previous academic year: Govt. to pvt. schools||A day after The Hindu reported that school managements were not complying with the High Court order on fees, the State Government on Friday issued an order addressing the contentious issue. For the previous 2020-21 academic year, the Government has instructed school managements to collect only 85% of the tuition fees that they charged parents in 2019-20. The order has been issued two months after the High Court of Karnataka directed school managements to give a 15% discount on fees for the 2020-21 academic year. The State Government in the order said the school managements that had collected more than 85% of tuition fees should issue a refund or adjust it for the current 2021-22 academic year. The Government has also said that if school managements wish to collect a lower fee they can do so as long as they don’t charge over 85%. Schools are not allowed to collect term fees and special development fees. On November 11, The Hindu had reported that many school managements were not complying with the High Court order and were instead telling parents that it was not applicable to them. The Government had earlier stated that schools should give a 30% discount. They could ask for only 70% of the tuition fees they had charged in the 2019-20 for the 2020-21 academic year. But the High Court in September stated that in lieu of underutilised facilities during that academic year, school managements should give a 15% discount. Sijo Sebastian, Voice of Parents Association, Karnataka said that they were thrilled that the government had finally woken up to the problem. "We however hope that the Department of Public Instruction not only issues the order but also implements it seriously this year," he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/collect-only-85-fees-for-previous-academic-year-govt-to-pvt-schools/article37467026.ece
13 November 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Engineer’s experiment with Boer goat||T.S. Umesh, 47-year-old from Tarabenahalli of Tumakuru district, chose agriculture instead of office soon after completing his engineering degree in 1990. People laughed at him then for returning to the village to take up farming. Undeterred by this, Mr. Umesh charted his own course in farming on his 7.5 acres of land and used his engineering aptitude and outlook to better practices. After rearing poultry birds for a long time, he is now experimenting with foreign breeds of goats that have a niche market. He brought a male Boer goat and two female goat kids from South Africa through his contacts in Pune, shelling out over Rs. 2 lakh. The Boer goat is known for its quick growth, huge yield of meat as a fully grown adult can weigh upto 150 kg. However, Mr. Umesh has experimented with this breed by crossing them with the Talcher variety of native female goats. Newborns from this combination weigh in the range of 20 to 30 kg in six months, he said. Package plan The varieties which are crossed between Boer and Talcher breeds are being sold at a rate of Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 3,500 a kg. Mr. Umesh plans to evolve a package under which one such crossed male and five females would be available for around Rs. 1,50,000. However, a pure Boer male goat costs Rs. 7 lakh. “Presently, these goats are ideal for breeding purpose than meat as they come with heavy pricing and are a rarity in India,” he observed. Mr. Umesh’s stall is a huge hit at the ongoing Krishi Mela. “Agriculture is no way inferior to high-profile jobs in cities. But you must work hard and wait patiently for returns,” Mr. Umesh said. He earns around Rs. 15 lakh a year from agriculture. His advise to farmers: “Produce your own manure for crops by taking up animal husbandry. Do not depend on chemical fertilisers as they affect soil fertility.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/engineers-experiment-with-boer-goat/article37467031.ece
13 November 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Bengaluru’s wet waste to turn manure for urban gardens||Urban gardeners can now get quality manure as the Karnataka Compost Development Corporation Ltd. (KCDC), which hitherto sold compost only to bulk buyers like farmers, has now entered the urban market segment. Interestingly, KCDC uses Bengaluru city’s wet waste to make compost and vermicompost for gardening enthusiasts. KCDC showcased these products for the first time at the ongoing Krishi Mela of the University of Agricultural Sciences-Bengaluru. KCDC chairman S. Mahadevaiah told The Hindu that the corporation was trying to get space at the Seeds Corporation in Hebbal besides Lalbagh to set up its sales counters. In addition to this, it will be available at all wet waste processing centres of the BBMP. The initiative is mainly aimed at catering to the demand for organic farming, which is catching up. Presently, Bengaluru city generates 4,500 tonnes of waste a day, including 2,500 tonnes of wet waste. BBMP authorities have set up seven processing units to process wet waste of which three are shut. The four working units do not operate to their full potential. H.R. Sathish, vice-president of KCDC, pointed out that it was possible to put an end to the problem of landfills – garbage being dumped in quarry pits and vacant spaces – if the government and BBMP set up the required infrastructure to process wet waste. This not only resolves the garbage problem, but also helps farmers and urban gardeners, he noted. It is possible to process only 600 tonnes of wet waste a day now despite the availability of huge raw material. This yields only 70 to 90 tonnes of compost a day. It is possible to produce 600 tonnes of compost a day if the entire quantum of wet waste is processed, he said. Presently, KCDC supplies manure to farmers at subsidised rates. But the government has reduced the subsidy grant given to farmers. Hence, the sale of manure to farmers has been slightly affected, said Mr. Mahadevaiah. For urban consumers, the prices of compost have been fixed as Rs. 25, Rs. 60, Rs. 90, and Rs. 310 for bags of one, three, five, and 25 kg, respectively. Similarly, for vermicompost, prices have been fixed at Rs. 50, Rs. 120, Rs. 200, and Rs. 500 for bags of one, three, five, and 25 kg, respectively.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bengalurus-wet-waste-to-turn-manure-for-urban-gardens/article37467029.ece
13 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC stays UG law exams starting Nov. 15||The High Court of Karnataka on Friday stayed the examinations of undergraduate law courses to be conducted by the Karnataka State Law University (KSLU) from November 15. Justice Ashok S. Kinagi passed the interim order on a batch of petitions filed by Rishab Trakraoo and other students, who are pursuing various law courses in the colleges affiliated to the KSLU in the State. The petitioners have contended that the decision of the KSLU amounts to violation of the directives of University Grants Commission and the State Government to promote students based on the parameters set by the UGC, without conducting examinations in view of the pandemic. The court said the students’ contentions required detailed consideration, and that they would be discriminated if exams were held when many other universities were promoting law students based on the UGC’s parameters. Noticing that the State Government had issued a circular on July 23, 2021, clearly dispensing with the examination for the II and IV semesters in three-year degree courses apart from the others, the court said the KSLU issued circular for holding exams contrary to the circular issued by the Government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-stays-ug-law-exams-starting-nov-15/article37467027.ece
13 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine programme launched||Under the universal immunisation programme, the Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV) programme was launched in the city on Friday on the occasion of ‘World Pneumonia Day’. The programme aims to spread awareness and reduce mortality and morbidity among children due to pneumonia. Bacterial pneumonia Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai had launched the programme in the State on October 22 at KIMS, Hubballi. Pneumococcal is the name of a group of diseases caused by a bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of bacterial pneumonia in children under five years. Young children (particularly those under two years), elderly, and those whose immune system is suppressed or are malnourished are at an increased risk of getting pneumococcal disease. In India, it is estimated that over 1.2 million children die before their 5th birthday and 15.9% of deaths are due to pneumonia. PCV is safe and effective in preventing pneumococcal disease, stated a press release. It reduces the incidence of pneumonia, meningitis and other serious bacterial infections caused by pneumococcus. The release said that two primary doses at six weeks and 14 weeks, and a booster dose at nine months is advised.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pneumococcal-conjugate-vaccine-programme-launched/article37467019.ece

13 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||GoM focuses on rationalisation of GST rates||Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, who is heading the Group of Ministers on Goods and Services Tax (GST), on Friday chaired a meeting on rate rationalisation and ways for revenue augmentation. The GoM has to submit a report in a month. Discussions in the virtual meeting on Friday lasted for nearly four hours. As on date, there are multiple rates comprising four mains — 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28% — and some special rates such as 0%, 0.25%, and 3%. There was a plan for long time to reduce the number of rates and one idea was to merge 12% and 18% and fix a consolidated rate of 15%. The GoM also discussed various combinations and tax rates on different raw materials, official sources said. Union Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has suggested the GoM to recommend the rationalisation measures, including merger of tax rate slabs for evolving a simple tax structure. The GoM was constituted on September 24 and asked to submit its report in two months. The meeting was delayed as Mr. Bommai was busy in byelection campaign.  Next meeting Sources said the GoM’s report would be ready before the next meeting of the GST Council to enable the council to hold discussions on the recommendations of the report and decide future course of action.

13 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Diversionary tactic’||Responding to allegations by the BJP of involvement of Congress leaders, MLA and former Minister Priyank Kharge on Friday said the party was misleading the public by “selective quoting”. “The statement by the accused says in one para that he had partied with Mohammed Nalapad. Apart from that there has been no mention anywhere related to the accused’s crimes. Moreover, if Congress leaders are involved, we are open to a fair probe. The Chief Minister, instead of making counter allegations, can bring out the truth,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/diversionary-tactic/article37467050.ece
13 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Is Prime Minister’s advice to CM right?’||Congress leader and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Friday sought to know whether it was correct on the part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ask Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai to “ignore” the allegations regarding the alleged bitcoin scam in the State. Mr. Siddaramaiah, in a series of tweets, sought an impartial probe into the case, and asked, “Instead of asking the Chief Minister to investigate and prove his innocence, how is it correct for the Prime Minister to tell him to ignore the allegations? Can the Prime Minister unilaterally decide?” the Congress leader asked. Noting that the Central and State investigating agencies were probing the bitcoin scam, he said, “Mr. Bommai is the present Chief Minister and was also Home Minister under the previous government led by B.S. Yediyurappa. By asking the Chief Minister to ignore it at this stage of investigation, is the Prime Minister asking him to drop the investigation?” “We don’t know if Mr. Bommai is involved in the bitcoin scam or not. All we are asking is to investigate it properly and punish the guilty. Why is Mr. Modi asking the CM to ignore?” he sought to know. Mr. Bommai, after meeting with Mr. Modi in Delhi on Thursday, had said the Prime Minister had advised him not to bother about the issue, and instead work for the people with dedication and honesty. “BJP Karnataka leaders are trying to prevent us from speaking by claiming the involvement of Congress leaders. They have the Government both at the Centre and State. Let them investigate impartially and reveal the names of those involved,” Mr. Siddaramaiah said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/is-prime-ministers-advice-to-cm-right/article37467057.ece

Addressing presspersons in Hubballi on Friday, BJP State General Secretary Mahesh Tenginakai said that for overall coordination of the party’s campaign, four teams have been formed. They will be headed by State unit president Nalin Kumar Kateel, the former Chief Ministers B.S. Yediyurappa and Jagadish Shettar and Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister K.S. Eshwarappa. Mr. Tenginakai said that the yatre will be taken out in Uttara Kannada and Haveri districts on November 18, in Dharwad and Gadag districts on November 19, in Bagalkot and Vijayapura districts on November 20 and in Belagavi district and Chikkodi organisational district on November 21.

Regarding the selection of candidates for the Council polls, he said that the candidates will be finalised soon and the party is expecting to win 12 to 15 seats. On the bitcoin scam, he said that it will be better if the former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar and other Congress leaders stopped making allegations without any evidence. They should refrain from indulging in their misinformation campaign. Otherwise, party workers will start filing complaints against them, he said. He said that Mr. Siddaramaiah disgraced the leaders of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes by commenting that they were joining the BJP for the sake of livelihood. Mr. Siddaramaiah, who failed to help members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in his party, is now issuing such irresponsible statements that are highly condemnable, he said. BJP office-bearers Lingaraj Patil, Dattamurthy Kulkarni and Ravi Naik were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/janaswaraj-yatre-from-nov-18/article37467252.ece
13 November 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||No official decision yet on renaming Unkal lake||While a group of residents from Unkal and members of various organisations held a programme to rename the historical Unkal Lake as Channabasava Sagar, the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation has clarified that no official decision has been taken yet on the issue because of the Model Code of Conduct in force. It might be recalled that on last Sunday, members of Lingayat community, residents of Unkal village and members of various organisations held a programme to rename the Unkal Lake and unveiled the name board of Channabasava Sagar. Sri Channabasavanand Swami, who initiated and coordinated the event along with members of various organisations, had said during the meeting that the High Court of Karnataka, Dharwad, had directed the Municipal Corporation to take decision on the earlier resolution of Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Council regarding renaming Unkal Lake. And they were expecting that it would take the official decision keeping in mind the historical relevance of renaming the lake after twelfth century Sharana Channabasavanna, he had said. In its order, the High Court had directed the respondent (Municipal Corporation) to consider the representation of the petitioners on renaming the Unkal Lake as per an earlier resolution (No. 569) of January 16, 2003 in accordance with the law within a period of three months on receipt of the order. When contacted, Commissioner of Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation Suresh Itnal told The Hindu that as the model poll code of conduct was in force, they had not taken any decision on the issue. Once the poll code ended, it would be taken up for discussion and appropriate steps would be taken in accordance with law, he said. As per the procedure, any resolution on such matters would have to be forwarded to the State Gvernment for approval and implementation could be done only after requisite approval. Meanwhile, the petitioners in the case said they would wait for appropriate steps by the municipal authorities and hoped that they would honour the earlier decision of the municipal council, which was taken to honour the sentiments of the people. As per historical references Channabasavanna, leading a large group of 12th century Sharanas (followers of Basaveshwara), sojourned at Unkal Lake before proceeding to Ulavi in Uttara Kannada district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-official-decision-yet-on-renaming-unkal-lake/article37467262.ece

Mohandas Pai on Thursday said the World Konkani Centre will lend a helping hand to the youth from the community and empower them to be torchbearers who foster the rich legacy of the community for the next generations. He was speaking virtually at the two-day decennial celebrations of T.V. Raman Pai and T. Vimala Pai Hostel on the centre’s Shaktinagar campus here. Mr. Pai said that a number of programmes initiated by the Centre would ensure the community not only works for its nation, but also the State and the town where it has established its presence. Mr. Pai said that the Konkani-speaking community was globally small, with estimates putting it at 20 lakh. With the number of those speaking the language on the wane, the role of World Konkani Centre in fostering the language was all the more important. The Vishwa Konkani Student Scholarship Fund was initiated to help every deserving student to get quality education and empowering them has brought the desired results. The Vishwa Konkani Student Scholarship Fund Alumni Association was set up to train future generations of leaders from Konkani speaking community. The World Konkani Centre will also act as a rallying point for the Kharvi, Kudubi and Siddi communities who share Konkani lineage, Mr. Pai said. Inaugurating the decennial celebrations, Ullas Kamath, Joint MD, Jyothi Laboratories, said that the hostel helped realise Mr. Pai’s vision for an empowered Konkani community by 2030. He urged the Konkani youth to make optimal use of various training provided to them at World Konkani Centre. The fact that the hostel is also serving as a training centre for other underprivileged youth is worth emulating, he said. On the occasion, Mr. Pai was inducted into the Hall of Fame at the World Konkani Centre by Mr. Kamath and others. Konkani Language and Cultural Foundation president Basti Vaman Shenoy, vice-president Kudpi Jagadish Shenoy, Alumni Association patron Sandeep Shenoy and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/empowering-youth-from-konkani-community/article37467603.ece

In a letter to Ms. Jolle, copies of which were marked to BJP national president J.P. Nadda and other senior leaders, Mr. Manippadi said ordering a survey had become a trend or a means of “threatening” those who had allegedly embezzled wakf properties to pay “due respects”. 7,000-page report He pointed out that he had submitted a 7,000-page report (Anwar Manippadi Committee Report) on embezzlement of wakf properties during the tenure of the BJP Government in 2012. Instead of taking the report to its logical conclusion, the Minister was dragging the embezzlement issue, he said, alleging that the wakf board had been the “biggest corruption den” in Karnataka. Mr. Manippadi said, “You and the Government are allowing corruption to go on, and finally the Muslim community will be left with nothing ...” Giving some examples, Mr. Manippadi alleged that the Government and the party were bent on holding an election to choose a chairman of the wakf board and installing a man accused of misusing government grant-in-aid funds for construction of compounds for masjids, and the issue was in the High Court. Moreover, he was not a BJP member and was opposed to the BJP, he said. Mr. Manippadi also alleged that the Government appointed a person facing numerous complaints and inquiries as a nodal officer of the Haj committee. He accused Ms. Jolle of having “determined to ruin Muslims” and criticised her statement that the wakf board does not have funds to fight encroachment cases. Revenue from idgahs and dargahs in Karnataka would amount to around Rs. 500 crore each month, if accounts were not manipulated, he said. He suggested that Ms. Jolle could resign if she was unable to handle the department.  Ordering a survey has become a trend or a means of threatening those who had allegedly embezzled wakf properties to pay due respects.

The problem could be addressed through community participation and collaboration of organisations with the administration, he said, at a meeting of principals of colleges affiliated to Mangalore University on Wednesday. The meeting discussed challenges to solid waste management in the city. Mr. Sridhar said students could play a greater role in creating awareness. P. Subrahmanya Yadapadithaya, V-C, said willpower was important to solve the issue. “With cooperation and collaboration between people and governance, we can achieve wonders. Volunteers from organisations like NSS and Red Cross could play a vital role. Funding was also a key factor,” he said.  The city’s civic representatives also participated in the discussion and explained the seriousness of the waste disposal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/address-waste-disposal-together/article37467606.ece
13 November 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Efforts of citizens to save Chamundi Hills gain traction||The series of landslips due to heavy rains during the last few weeks has given fresh impetus to citizens of Mysuru to rally around to save Chamundi Hills from environmental degradation as a fallout of development projects by authorities in the recent years. The road to Nandi statue from View Point Junction is out of bounds as there have been three landslips since October 20. The PWD in charge of maintaining the roads has roped in experts from the Indian Institute of Science to study the area and come out with a technical solution. But local activists including NGOs like Mysore Grahakara Parishat and others aver that the authorities should wake up to the larger issue of conservation rather than adopting ad hoc measures. Bhamy V. Shenoy of the MGP has reiterated the demand to constitute a Chamundi Hill Development Authority on the lines of MM Hills Development Authority so that all stakeholders have a say in its future. Dr. Shenoy said though Chamundi Hills is a cultural, spiritual and tourist centre apart from being a major lung space and biodiversity hotspot for Mysuru, the local people have no say in its future. Development plans are taken up without public consultation and this includes the series of concrete structures like vehicle parking facility and shopping kiosks constructed at the hill top at a cost of Rs. 80 crore despite opposition. The net result is the ecological degradation of the hills which is coming to the fore and hence an online campaign will also be launched to drum up public support to save Chamundi Hills, said Dr. Shenoy. Morning Kannada daily Andolana recently conducted a ‘Strengthen Chamundi Hills’ programme in which a cross-section of people aired their views. There are plans to take it forward in the ongoing efforts to let the public have a say in issues related to conservation of Chamundi Hills. Banu Mohan, an environmental activist, said the hill top was fast turning into a concrete jungle and there are threats to the ecological integrity by projects like the ropeway, proposal to expand the two-lane road to four-lane etc., that are frequently mooted by local elected representatives. Meanwhile, there is an emerging consensus that the authorities should regulate the movement of private vehicles so as to reduce the pressure on the hills as it is done on all the Fridays of Ashada Masa. What is intriguing is that the State government had proposed to take up additional works under the Centre’s PRASAD (Pilgrimage Rejuvenation And Spirituality Augmentation Drive) scheme which envisaged introducing electrically-operated vehicles to ferry tourists. This, coupled with ban on private vehicles, is expected to reduce the pressure on hills considerably. If introduced, the parking facility constructed after felling hundreds of trees despite opposition, will become redundant and underline the shortsightedness of the authorities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/efforts-of-citizens-to-save-chamundi-hills-gain-traction/article37467362.ece
13 November 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Traders oppose ‘banner campaign’||The Mysuru City Corporation’s “banner campaign” for recovering property tax dues from top defaulters has come under criticism with traders and businessmen in Mysuru accusing the MCC of ‘harassing’ and ‘targeting’ them in the name of tax recovery. The Federation of Organisations and Associations of Mysuru, a body of traders and businessmen, on Friday said the MCC’s tax structure was ‘imbalanced’ and the traders have been demanding streamlining of the tax system. It said the delay in payment of property tax by the commercial establishments and others was because of relief sought from the government in view of COVID-19. However, there was no response from the government on their plea. Federation President B.S. Prashanth alleged that the MCC was misleading the public by stating that the taxes have not been paid by some property owners since the last 8 to 10 years whereas taxes for the period of only one year were pending. The MCC had said top 20 defaulters in each zone of the city have been identified and they are being focused on for recovery and not everyone. Only those who have not paid tax for many years are being targeted. Mysuru Hotel Owners’ Association President C. Narayana Gowda said Mysuru’s tax structure was different from other cities, including Bengaluru, and was ‘biased’ and ‘unfriendly’. He alleged that the MCC got the power supply of some hotels disconnected for not paying the tax for one year. The tax was not paid in view of COVID-19 as the hotels and other sectors suffered due to the pandemic. The traders also cited the imposition of “super commercial tax” on certain properties which was unheard of in other cities. MCC Commissioner Lakshmikanth Reddy told The Hindu that the MCC was going ahead with its drive. He clarified that the MCC was not targeting those who have kept their dues pending for one year and also not putting up banners on their premises. However, such persons have been served notices and only those who have kept their dues for more than two years are being covered. “We have disconnected the UGD of those who have continued to default on tax and the MCC has no jurisdiction to disconnect power supply to the properties of the defaulters as claimed,” Mr. Reddy said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/traders-oppose-banner-campaign/article37467358.ece

Geetha has directed officials concerned to clean water sources at hostels under various departments, private institutions, and residential schools for tribal children in the wake of the Norovirus outbreak in Wayanad. Ms. Geetha has also directed the officials of local bodies and the Health Department to collect and test water samples from the institutions, if needed, and adopt necessary action. About 1,000 cases of acute diarrhoeal disease were reported in the district in October-November, District Surveillance Officer Savan Sara Mathew told The Hindu . But, most of them were sporadic. A major outbreak affecting 76 persons was reported at the College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences in Pookode, said Dr. Mathew. When many instances of diarrhoeal disease were reported among students living in hostels, the Health Department sent seven stool samples for testing at the National Virology Institute, Alappuzha, by the first week of November. Four of the seven samples tested positive for the virus, she said. Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (KVASU) Vice Chancellor M.R. Saseendranath said the cases were reported only among students who lived in a private hostel outside the campus. It was suspected that those students had consumed fast food from some restaurants in a nearby town, he added. All water sources on the campus were super chlorinated. All hostels were told to maintain hygiene as per the directions issued by the Health and Food Safety departments after some incidents of food poisoning were reported from the hostels on the campus a few weeks ago, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/norovirus-outbreak-wayanad-hostels-under-the-scanner/article37467271.ece
13 November 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Rebranded KTDC budget hotels making profit, despite pandemic||Buoyed by the response to KTDC hotels and motels that were given a facelift and rebranded in 2019, the agency is set to launch Foodie Wheels, a bus cafe, facing the backwaters at Vaikom. A bus was procured for the purpose from the KSRTC and an upper deck added, after which it was tastefully done up and placed at what was once a dumping yard behind motel Aaram in Vaikom. In addition, the premises were landscaped to provide guests a soothing experience. The concept was borrowed from Sayahna, the garden restaurant of the KTDC-run Hotel Mascot in Thiruvananthapuram. The Rs. 35-lakh venture near the Vaikom temple will be inaugurated on Monday by Minister for Tourism and Public Works P.A. Mohamed Riyas. Tie up with KSRTC The first-of-its-kind initiative from the KTDC-KSRTC tie-up will be extended to other tourist locales where land is scarce and construction is tough, said Krishna Teja, Director of Kerala Tourism and Managing Director, KTDC. It is the latest from the stable of Mission Facelift, which the KTDC — whose properties are located in prime areas — launched in 2019 to improve patronage. Under this, many motels known by the name Aaram were rechristened as Aahar (Sanskrit for food), which people speaking different languages can easily relate to. Furthermore, each was given a name which captured the essence of its location, be it backwaters (hence Ripple Land for its property in Alappuzha) or Loom Land in Kannur (a district famous for looms and ballads). The economy hotels, hitherto known under the Tamarind brand name, are being upgraded and rebranded as modern budget hotels that end with the name Land. Wooing visitors Interestingly, hospitality units which got a facelift and were rebranded have begun to yield operational profit. They include what is better known as Grand Chaithram, a budget hotel in the heart of Thiruvananthapuram city. It was all about reinventing each unit, which began with doing away with unnecessary compound walls to improve their visibility. In addition, colours that appealed to tourists were selected and lighting and signages improved. Substantial changes were made to interiors, public toilets, and gardens, Mr. Teja said. The rebranded Aahar units have become popular as clean restaurants serving quality food. In addition, premium resorts will be readied at Muzhipilangad, Bekal, and Kanyakumari, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/foodie-wheels-to-be-launched-at-vaikom/article37467323.ece

Similarly, the number of vehicles used for collecting waste too has to be increased. On doorstep collection of waste from commercial establishments, Kalamassery has to increase the coverage to 70% by March next year and 100% by March, 2023. Thripunithura has to attain 100% coverage by March next. The two have to increase the number of material collection facilities, as there is considerable gap in their expected count. They should improve their performance in setting up material collection facilities by March. The municipalities have to quantify waste coming in and taken out of the collection facilities. Weighing machines should be installed to estimate the quantity of waste, as per the LSGD directive.

The convict, a 46-year-old, will also have to pay a fine of Rs. 3 lakh, which will go to the victims. Though judge K. Soman sentenced him to 36 years rigorous imprisonment on multiple counts in two cases, it stands effectively reduced to 10 years, as he shall undergo the term sentences concurrently. However, he has little respite, as the sentence of imprisonment for the rest of his natural life will kick in immediately thereafter on the cases charged invoking, among others, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and Juvenile Justice Act. The cases date back to 2015. The conviction came in a case charge-sheeted by Maradu police Inspector Sibi Tom. Advocate P.A. Bindu was the prosecutor. He was also convicted in a case registered for assaulting the victim’s 12-year-old younger sister who threatened to report the abuse of her 15-year-old elder sister. The first 10 years of rigorous imprisonment is for assaulting the younger girl. The abuse came to light after the younger girl reported the abuse of her sister and the assault on her by the convict to the school authorities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/man-gets-10-year-ri-life-term-for-rape-of-minor/article37467509.ece

13 November 2021||KOTTAYAM/KOCHI,KERALA||Mixed reaction to referendum proposal||The recommendation (proposed Bill) of the State Law Reforms Commission, headed by former Supreme Court judge K.T. Thomas, that the State Government must go in for a referendum in disputed parishes in the Malankara Church to determine the right to administer the places of worship and auxiliary institutions has evoked different reactions from legal experts and observers of the dispute between the Jacobite and Orthodox factions. Final submission The commission made its final submission more than a week ago and it assumes significance against the background of a Supreme Court verdict on July 3, 2017 that there should be no parallel administration in the Malankara Church and that the Orthodox faction would have full right over the parish churches and their administration. The Government went ahead implementing the Supreme Court verdict using its law-enforcement machinery to hand over more than 50 churches to the Orthodox faction. Mr. Thomas claimed that the referendum was being proposed in the absence of an amicable agreement over the ownership of parishes. The attempt of the commission is to expand the concept in the SC verdict on right title and interest, and this could be ascertained by collecting the majority opinion. The argument that the state has no right to surpass the SC order through legislation was a farce since there had been several instances of the state outdoing SC orders. ‘No legal sanctity’ Avocate Kaleeswaram Raj said the recommendation was at best an expression of opinion for the resolution of a dispute, but there was no legal sanctity to it. A legal verdict did not depend on the majority opinion, as in an election. The party which won the court verdict can, at any time, disagree to or reject a settlement proposed by the other party that was not agreeable to them, he said. The Orthodox Church termed the proposal unilateral and discriminatory. It accused the commission of taking out of context a few lines from the apex court order of 2017 to bring in referendum as a solution. ‘Secular activity’ Jacobite Church lay trustee Peter K. Elias said Supreme Court verdict had observed that the appointment of priests was a secular activity and not a spiritual one and that the Government could go in for legislation to control the economic, social, and other activities related to the churches. Way to end the dispute Retired judge of the High Court Kemal Pasha said the best way to end the dispute was to hold a referendum and he welcomed the commission proposal. Advocate A. Jayashankar expressed the opinion that justice, equity and fair play should be ensured in the settlement of the dispute in the Malankara Church.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mixed-reaction-to-referendum-proposal/article37467332.ece
13 November 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Ahead of Children’s Day, teachers from State pay tribute to Nehru||‘Chachaji’, as India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru is popularly known, has quite a fan following among children, who pay tribute to him every year on his birth anniversary on November 14, observed as Children’s Day. But this time, a few teachers from different parts of the State are also paying tribute to Nehru in the form of a dance presentation. A three-minute dance video prepared by them is to hit the web on Saturday. The video titled ‘Chachaji’ has been brought out under the banner of Sraavanika, a collective of school teachers across the State. The video features Sukanya P., a teacher of Sree Ramakrishna Mission Higher Secondary School in Kozhikode, depicting a few lines on Nehru through classical dance mudras. What makes the video different is that it is not music that she is dancing to, but to prose. “Most dance videos are music-based. We thought why not present prose in a rhythm in place of music, so that the focus will be on the meaning depicted through the mudras,” said Ms. Sukanya. The lines were written by Vineetha P., a teacher of Chemancheri Upper Primary School, and composed by Beena K.K, a teacher from Government Higher Secondary School, Pannippara, Malappuram. They were rendered by Sindhu A.V., a teacher of Government Vocational Higher Secondary School, Agali, Palakkad. Asha Mohan of St. Teresa’s Anglo Indian School, Kannur, directed the video while Sindhu P.A., District Programme Officer of SSK, Alappuzha, handled editing, Jessy V.A. of St. Thomas High School, Koorachundu, Kozhikode, did art direction and Beena P.G. of Government Upper Primary School, Naripparambu, Palakkad, did costume designing. “It took us less than three weeks to come up with the video as most of the work was done online,” said Ms. Sukanya. The video will be released online by Tourism Minister P.A. Mohamed Riyas at 3 p.m. on Saturday in the presence of Women’s Commission Chairperson P.

13 November 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Despite warnings, paddy field conversion continues unabated||Warnings issued by the district administration and the Revenue Department have not deterred real estate agents aiding the conversion of large acres of abandoned paddy fields into garden lands with the consent of landowners. Flex boards assuring “trouble-free” conversion at affordable prices have come up along several city and rural roads to lure landowners. Though the village authorities say that they have never encouraged such large-scale conversions for resale purposes, the agents working in the field claim that they are not doing anything illegal, but are only exploring the recently altered provisions in the Kerala Conservation of Paddy Land and Wetland Act, 2008. According to some real estate agents and those offering paid conversion services, the Revenue Department collects 10% of the fair value of the converted land as processing fee for a plot between 25 cents to one acre, and 20% for plot above one acre, thereby earning profit. Countering the allegations, the Revenue Department authorities say the altered rule was to facilitate the construction of houses for those who owned only abandoned paddy fields as inherited property. However, a few people were using it to convert large acres of land for real estate purposes and pocket commission amount, they add. It has been found that many such agents are approaching landowners directly to highlight the technicalities involved in the conversion process and to present them with options to clear those with their support. The district administration has urged landowners to be careful while dealing with such tricky offers executed without legal backing. Senior Revenue Department officers have pointed out that no private agencies or middlemen have been appointed to facilitate the conversion process. Village-level squads They have said that the details of those who continue with outdoor campaigns for land conversion activities will be collected and handed over to the district administration. The village-level squads are also monitoring such agencies for prompt action, they add.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/despite-warnings-paddy-field-conversion-continues-unabated/article37467281.ece

The farmers said they would not allow the Kerala Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (Kinfra) to acquire land for the corridor without addressing their concerns. The police blocked the protestors in front of the Kinfra gate. The agitators alleged that Kinfra did not hold any discussions with the land holders even when the first phase of the acquisition had begun.

About 600 acres will be acquired in the first phase. The farmers also accused Kinfra authorities of fixing the land price unilaterally. Kinfra has reportedly fixed Rs. 36,000 for a cent of farm land and Rs. 82,000 for a cent of plantation. The protestors said the price was far way below their expectations.

13 November 2021||PALAKKAD,KERALA||Nod given, Kalpathy chariots set to roll||The people of Kalpathy heritage village heaved a sigh of relief on Friday when the State Government permitted chariot movements as part of the Kalpathy festival. The chariots of different deities will be taken out on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday during the festival, which is expected to be attended by scores of devotees. The organisers of the festival secured a special permit from the Government as the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), headed by District Collector Mrunmai Joshi, denied permission for the chariot movements. Curbs in place The DDMA had observed that it would be nearly impossible to take the deities in chariots along the narrow village lanes of Kalpathy without violating the restrictions imposed by the Government. The Government had restricted the crowds to 200 in open areas and 100 inside the temple. The DDMA’s decision had dampened the spirit of the Kalpathy devotees who wanted the chariot festival to be held with the customary religious fervour after a year’s gap. COVID-19 restrictions had reduced the festival to a symbolic one last year. The organisers said that all but the giant chariot of Lord Shiva would be pulled around the villages by a specially trained group of men. The Government, in its special order, has allowed those who have taken two doses of COVID-19 vaccine and those who test negative for the disease to take part in the festival. Matter of prestige Apart from the Malabar Devaswom Board, Palakkad Municipality too approached the Government seeking a special sanction as the festival became matter of prestige for many, including the BJP, the Congress and the organisers. The BJP alleged that it was the farcical move made by Congress MLA Shafi Parambil and the CPI(M) that caused uncertainties over Kalpathy festival. It accused Mr. Parambil of creating a false impression that the Government had permitted the festival.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kalpathy-chariots-ready-to-roll/article37467275.ece

Govinda Rao, former director, National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, has called for the inclusion of petroleum products, electricity and real estate under the ambit of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). Prof. Govinda Rao was delivering the keynote address at the opening session of the international seminar on ‘India’s experience with GST’ organised by the Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation (GIFT) on Friday. Pointing out that the time is ripe for reforms in GST, Prof. Rao urged the Centre to extend the GST compensation period by another three years for protecting State revenues. ‘Promises not met’ After four years, the GST regime has not fulfilled promises, he said. “It has a number of birth defects and fault lines, which need to be remedied. Of course, the reform is here to stay, and it is not possible to reverse the reform and we can’t go back to the sales tax regime now,” he said. The multiplicity of tax rates is creating confusion, he said, suggesting that the rates be limited to two instead of the present four. The base of the tax structure is narrow due to the large number of exemptions. Multiple rates have led to an inverted duty structure and classification disputes, leading to complications, he said. Prof. Rao drew attention to the ‘partial nature” of GST due to the exclusion of petroleum products, real estate and electricity. “It is important that the GST compensation period is extended by another three years at least when the reforms are rolled out,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/expert-calls-for-inclusion-of-fuel-power-under-gst/article37467328.ece
13 November 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Social media need regulation: experts||Cybersecurity experts have mooted creation of an independent regulatory body on the lines of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) to keep tabs on social media in the country. The participants of a panel discussion that debated the propriety of regulating social media platforms in democratic societies as part of c0c0n 2021 annual conclave on Friday were unanimous in their demand for regulating cyberspace, especially social networking platforms that operate in India. Jiten Jain, Director of Voyager Infosec, said the regulator should not be controlled by the government since it could spur accusations of political bias. The independent body should be empowered to provide day-to-day response as well as graded punishments for violating internet norms. He also raised concern over the reluctance shown by social media platforms in complying with the rules of the country as well as the ‘double standards’ while dealing with the regulations of various countries. “Facebook and Twitter could silence a sitting President of the United States (former President Donald Trump), but have turned down the Government of India’s order to take down handles operated by extremist organisations that work against the country’s interests,” he said. Dinesh O. Bareja, chief operating officer, Open Security Alliance, rued the absence of any inquiry instituted against social media platforms in wake of the revelations made by the Facebook whistle-blower Frances Haugen. “Despite the country being mentioned in such disclosures, no committee has taken suo motu notice and issued a strongly worded directive. Our institutions lack teeth,” he said. He felt the regulatory body must ideally become a judicial authority that looked into all aspects of cyberworld. ‘A law by the U.N.’ Cybersecurity and cyberlaw expert Prashant Mali advocated the bringing out of a formal law by the United Nations to govern the Internet that could be later adopted by countries in a manner that suited their Constitution. He also called for regulating the social media with extensive public consultations. Apar Gupta, executive director of Internet Freedom Foundation, felt social media platforms should be perceived as companies that work to maximise profits by serving their users advertisements and gathering information to ensure their products were ‘addictive’. They play to the human nature by feeding the people’s base desires such as polarity, hate, social division etc. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology must release a white paper to develop consensus among the industry, academics, experts, and digital rights groups prior to setting up a regulatory authority, he added.  It should be an independent body and should not be controlled by the Government||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cyberspace-needs-regulatory/article37467329.ece

State Human Rights Commission chairperson Antony Dominic issued the order based on a complaint submitted by former Chief Secretary C.P. Nair, who passed away recently. In a press release, the commission said that there should be such a system to trace vehicles involved in hit-and-run cases, at a time when technology has advanced so much. The person responsible for the accident should take the injured to the hospital and ensure proper treatment. Those who escape without doing this are breaking the law and violating human rights. Govt. response The Home Secretary and the State Police Chief informed the SHRC that the police usually send out wireless messages to all stations in the district to trace the vehicle as soon as a hit-and-run case is reported. In case the vehicle is suspected to have crossed to the nearby districts, messages are relayed to these areas too. Investigation is taken up to trace the vehicle using CCTV visuals from shops and houses, as well as through cellphone signals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/trace-hit-and-run-case-offenders-rights-panel/article37467629.ece

In a letter to the suspended leader, KPCC president K. Sudhakaran said Mr. Latheef’s activities had led to factionalism among the party workers in the Chirayinkeezhu constituency. Charges He was also accused of attempting to scuttle Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan’s recent visit to Muthalappozhy, of giving a call for a protest march to the State party headquarters against the KPCC office-bearers’ list recently declared by the All Indian Congress Committee (AICC), and of attempting to defeat the purpose of the unit committee meetings organised to revitalise the party. Mr. Sudhakaran, in his letter, said that these activities can only be seen as a violation of party discipline. Protest march The leader, who is known to be close to former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, has been asked to submit an explanation within one week of receipt of the letter, on why he should not be permanently ousted from the party. Following his suspension, panchayat members and workers of the Congress and Youth Congress in Mangalapuram took out a protest march through the town. They accused the leadership of needlessly taking action against a leader who had played a key role in strengthening the party in the past four decades. The panchayat members and office-bearers of the party in Mangalapuram said they would resign from their positions in protest against his suspension.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kpccs-suspension-of-ex-secretary-irks-cadre/article37467630.ece

Anil has said. Addressing a press conference here on Friday, he said a campaign to update the details would be organised from November 15 to December 15. Errors had crept into the database during data entry into the Ration Card Management System during the updating process in 2017. Licences Mr. Anil said adalats would be held to address the delay in reinstating or permanently cancelling the licences of around 700 ration shops. The ration shops which were temporarily suspended are currently attached to the nearest ration shops. However, this situation had led to difficulties for consumers. The files regarding each of the shops would be taken up and the licences reinstated or permanently cancelled based on the seriousness of the discrepancies. In case of permanent cancellation, a new licensee would be identified through a notification, which would be issued by following the reservation guidelines of the Kerala Targeted Public Distribution System.

The group initiated the mango conservation programme during 2016 with the conservation of a 200-year-old tree of mango cultivar Vellathan. During 2017, Nattu Manchottil adopted activities for the conservation of 35 indigenous varieties of mango in Kannur district. It is now conserving around 200 varieties of mango trees collected from different parts of Kannur district. The group is also sharing grafted plants to various government organisations, including educational institutions, throughout the State for further conservation of local mango varieties. Their conservation activity has led to the declaration of Kannapuram, a panchayat about 15 km from Kannur town, as ‘Indigenous Mango Heritage Area’ on July 22, 2020.  Paddy conservation Satyanarayana Beleri, a farmer-turned-paddy conservator of Bellur, a quaint hamlet located in Kasaragod district, nominated by the IPR cell, won the Plant Genome Saviour Farmer Reward for the year 2018-19 given by the PPV&FRA.

13 November 2021||November 13 2021 00:00 IST,KERALA||Kurup takes liberties with real-life story||Kurup begins with a long disclaimer, which like all disclaimers, is filled with half-truths and disappears in a flash. It seems to have been aimed at distancing the movie from the real-life story. The horrific act of crime, which gave Kurup his notoriety, does not appear in the movie until well towards the midway point. But, the movie that takes a lot of creative liberties, presents this crime as one in a series of such acts by Gopikrishna Kurup (Dulquer Salmaan). The story and the script, written by Jithin K. Jose, K.S. Aravind, and Daniell Sayooj Nair, spend considerable time in establishing his character. Kurup’s crooked nature is evident right from the beginning, when he makes his parents believe that he had passed a public examination, which he had not. At the Air Force training camp too, he devises ways to get things done his way and make some money. Some of these early sequences seem rather forced, just to underline the character’s flamboyant nature. The romance with Saradha (Sobhita Dhulipala) also seems to be there just to tick all the boxes of a mainstream movie, with the character almost disappearing in the latter half. Kurup’s story is revealed to us through the recollections of his Air Force colleague Peter (Sunny Wayne), the diary entries of police officer Krishnadas (Indrajith Sukumaran) and from Kurup’s own version. Victim’s family Charlie (another star in a surprise role), the victim of Kurup’s criminal act to claim an insurance amount, and his family get just a couple of scenes, because this movie is all about Kurup, his wicked plans to move up the ladder and of course, his many stylish looks. To their credit, the writers do lay bare the criminal bent of his mind, but on the screen, many a time the camera worships Kurup as a hero. Comparison with NH 47 Contrast this treatment of the character with that in NH 47 , made in 1984, based on the same incident. Despite its sloppily written scenes, it gets right the characterisation of Kurup, played by T.G. Ravi, with a viewer never for once feeling like sympathising with or clapping for a scene in which he is shown. Although the makers of Kurup have included enough scenes to defend themselves against accusations of glorifying a criminal, they also seem to have been compelled to include some scenes to satisfy the star’s fans. A positive factor One of the things the film gets right is the production design, especially in scenes set in the bygone era, with tastefully done recreations of the 1970s and 80s. One could have taken a much kinder view of the script, which is engaging in parts, if not for the fact that it is based on a gruesome crime. If the intention was to tell the intriguing story of a fugitive, without celebrating him, they could have taken a few lessons from David Fincher’s Zodiac . For, there is only so much ‘creative’ liberty that one can take when it comes to a real-life story, despite all the disclaimers. S.R.

Mr. Keshav was addressing the media here on Friday, wherein he was quoting a letter written by the APERC to the Chief Secretary and the Energy Secretary. Mr. Keshav said he had met APERC Chairman C.V. Nagarjuna Reddy and other members of the commission on November 9, and apprised them of the difficulties being faced by the Discoms because of the pending subsidy dues and the bill amounts due to them from the local bodies and government departments. In the letter, the APERC suggested that the government give a 14-day notice to the local bodies and other offices to release the dues, or face disconnection of power. ‘Pending bills’ The APERC also highlighted the Rs. 9,783 crore power bill dues pending from the government institutions, and pointed out that the very existence of the Discoms was at stake due to the non-payment of bills and subsidy amounts. Mr. Keshav asked the government to immediately release the dues and not transfer the burden onto the common man in the form of ‘true-up’ charges. Two months ago, the APERC had permitted the Discoms to recover the ‘true-up’ charges amounting to Rs. 3,669 crore by taking into account their financial position.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/aperc-asked-govt-to-release-rs-15474-cr-to-discoms-keshav/article37467391.ece

13 November 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Cong. questions delay in Bitcoin probe||Former Minister for Information and Technology and Congress MLA Priyank Kharge on Friday claimed that the Bitcoin scam would cost Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai his job and sought an explanation from the Government for the delay in handing over the probe to the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The Chief Minister had said the case was referred to the ED and the CBI (Interpol Division) in March and April earlier this year, respectively. Addressing a press conference, Mr. Kharge said the case was referred to the ED only after the agency sought details of the case. “There was intentional delay by the State Government in informing the ED and Interpol of three months in spite of the voluntary statement of the accused that he had hacked more than 5,000 Bitcoins and was in possession of them,” the Congress leader alleged. A Government Order had stated that all cases related to economic offences falling outside the jurisdiction of the State should be informed to higher authorities, Mr. Kharge said. The former Minister alleged that the investigation into the case seemed more aimed at “burying the truth than uncovering it”. Father’s claims He also cited the petitions filed by the accused hacker Sri Krishna’s father Gopal Ramesh alleging that his son was forcefully administered an anxiety drug Alprazolam and the police carried out a “stomach wash” before a medical test ordered by the court. “Why was the accused drugged in custody?” he questioned. ‘Who received Bitcoins?’ Mr. Kharge also raised questions on the claim by the Bengaluru city police that they had “recovered 31.8 Bitcoins worth Rs. 9 crore from the hacker” which they later claimed was not to be. After the first punchnama that “seized 31.8 Bitcoins”, a second panchnama to transfer them was carried out and the police discovered 186.8 Bitcoins in the same wallet. “Where are these Bitcoins that are worth over Rs. 100 crore? Who received them and what measures have been taken to recover them?” asked Mr. Kharge. The former Minister also alleged that the chargesheet filed in the case was “incomplete”. Several claims made in the voluntary statement of the accused had not been investigated. In the statement, the accused had “confessed to an economic crime of transferring €80,000” but it was neither investigated, nor reported to the ED. He also questioned why the agency failed to recover any Bitcoins. Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president D.K. Shivakumar said Ministers and officials in the BJP Government had been providing documents related to the scam and the party would release them at an appropriate time. He said, “It is a public issue. Why should we not raise it? Whoever is involved in the scam, whether Congress or BJP leaders, should be punished.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cong-questions-delay-in-bitcoin-probe/article37466910.ece
13 November 2021||CHENNAI,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Pegasus a wake-up call for scribes’||A major shift is going on in journalism right now when technology, which was being seen an enabler, was being turned against journalists, said Bradley Hope, veteran investigative reporter and Pulitzer finalist. There is now a need for journalists to retrench from technology but still be available for sources and whistleblowers to reach them, added Mr. Hope, whose phone was on the Pegasus spyware list. Speaking at a virtual session on “Journalism in the Age of Surveillance” at the Asian College of Journalism on Friday, Mr. Hope said the Pegasus spyware issue showed widespread abuse of the system. “Once a country buys access to it [Pegasus], it can do anything with the spyware. Pegasus showed widespread abuse of the system. The company doesn’t monitor the use of it,” he said. Mr. Hope said even though an individual practised the best computer security practices, their phones were vulnerable to the spyware. “It is a pertinent wake up call for journalism because never before have we been so vulnerable. The way this technology has become a powerful tool, you are leaving all the trails that you are trying to lose,” he said. With people using their phones for everything, it was easier than ever before to access all of their information. Tech as temptation “It’s a simple temptation for governments, people in charge to use these spyware to surveil on their enemies, political opponents, people, journalists any one at all,” the journalist said. Mr. Hope said journalists in India and many other countries had to deal with these challenges of security as they don’t enjoy the same level of protection unlike in the U.K where he is based. “It is an important moment in journalism for journalists to retrench from technology. Sometimes we need to leave our phone behind [while meeting sources]. I have started to look at my phone as a risk that I carry around all the time”. He also said media organisations must also look at the ways of protecting their journalists. “It is critical how organisations buy their equipment. Sometimes [provide] two simple non-smart phones. Newsrooms too must think about what technology kits they are building around certain investigations,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/pegasus-a-wake-up-call-for-scribes/article37466899.ece

Chatram police station, rescued a man from a cemetery in Kilpauk by carrying him on her shoulders and rushing him to a hospital, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Friday personally felicitated her at his camp office, in the presence of senior police officers. In a message of appreciation handed over to her, the Chief Minister said she had truly realised the importance of the ‘golden hour’, and swung into action to rescue the man. The policewoman’s action, with a sense of commitment and full of compassion, was commendable, he said, recalling that she had also rescued several persons during a stampede in the Mahamaham in Kumbakonam in 1992. “Your actions have, on several occasions, been of much help to the downtrodden. Your recurring acts of rescuing destitute women and admitting them to government homes and bravely facing those in conflict with the law have rightly received commendations from senior police officers and words of praise from the general public,” he said. Ms. Rajeswari’s humanitarian action has added to the reputation of the Tamil Nadu police, he said. “As the Chief Minister, who also heads the Police Department, and as someone who has visited the people continuously during natural disasters, I extend my congratulations to you for your humanitarian act,” he said. DGP C. Sylendra Babu and Chennai Police Commissioner Shankar Jiwal were present. Puducherry Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan also commended Ms. Rajeshwari for her action. Ms. Soundararajan expressed her heartfelt appreciation for the inspector. Justice N. Anand Venkatesh of the Madras High Court invited Ms. Rajeswari to the court and handed over a letter of appreciation. The letter, penned in Tamil, began with a Tirukkural couplet “ Mannuyir Oambi Arulvaarkku…”, hailing the greatness of those showering kindness and protecting the lives of others. He extended his appreciation to her on behalf of the judiciary. Ms. Rajeswari had, on Thursday, rescued a 28-year-old man who was lying unconscious. He was later identified as Udayakumar. He was rushed to the Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital. He, however, died on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cm-felicitates-inspector-for-rescuing-man-during-rain/article37467083.ece
13 November 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Tusker creates panic at villages in Palamaner||A lone elephant, which is believed to be in “musth” (a periodical condition influencing the reproductive hormones among bulls) has become a cause of tension among half a dozen villages abutting Koundiya wildlife sanctuary in Palamaner. Divisional Forest Officer (Chittoor West) S. Ravi Shankar said the tusker, which got separated from its herd, was on the prowl in the forest fringe areas, raiding crops and showing violent behaviour towards villagers, for a fortnight. The animal on Thursday night raided a paddy field and chased the farmers when they tried to drive it away. Some youth at Gobbila Kotur village burst crackers to scare the animal away, but in vain. Elephant trackers and watchers rushed to the fields and diverted the tusker towards a forest enclosure. Despite repeated attempts to drive the animal back into the thickets, the elephant continued to emerge into the fields, taking temporary shelter among stockades. During the last week, seven villagers had a lucky escape when the elephant charged at them. A couple of days ago, a herd of elephants had ravaged paddy fields and trampled chilli and tomato plantations in Pengarakunta, Berupalle, Chinnakunta, and Krishnapuram villages. The DFO said the residents had been warned to be cautious with the lone elephant as its presence was always considered threatening to human habitations. “There is a steady increase in the population of wild elephants in the Koundinya sanctuary. At present, about 70 elephants are on the move. We have submitted proposals to the government for funds to carry out the necessary works such as advanced solar fencing.

13 November 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Naidu will continue to represent Kuppam’||TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu will continue to represent Kuppam in the Legislative Assembly, according to his son and party national general secretary Lokesh. Mr. Lokesh was addressing a roadshow in Kuppam on Friday as part of his whirlwind campaign for the municipal election. “Though I was asked to contest from Kuppam, I brushed aside the proposal. Mr. Naidu will continue to represent Kuppam. He will be the Chief Minister of the State again,” Mr. Lokesh said. Alleging that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had not visited Kuppam in the last couple of years, Mr. Lokesh said the government had deliberately scuttled the development of the Kuppam region by not releasing funds. “Kuppam is like a temple. People here have always supported peaceful conduct of elections. But the YSRCP has resorted to intimidation of people and has indulged in large-scale electoral violations,” he said. Accusing the police of working for the YSRCP, Mr. Lokesh said they had placed barricades in V. Kota and Shantipuram mandals to prevent the TDP cadres from entering Kuppam. Police cases “The police have so far filed 11 cases against me. I will face any number of cases for the sake of people,” Mr. Lokesh said, and exuded confidence that the TDP would win the municipal election by bagging majority wards. Meanwhile, mild tension prevailed in Lakshmipuram ward in Kuppam when a group of YSRCP cadres tried to block the convoy of Mr. Lokesh. It took an hour for the police to pacify both sides and restore order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-will-continue-to-represent-kuppam/article37467393.ece

13 November 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Padayatra is a farce, says Nani||Minister for Transport Perni Venkataramaiah alias Nani has said the “Maha Padayatra” of landowners belonging to Thullur and Tadikonda is a farce and most TDP leaders and real estate agents are taking part in it in the guise of farmers. “The padayatra should be named as ‘papa parihara yatra’, meant to seek redemption from the grave mistakes TDP chief N. Chandrabbau Naidu had done in Amavarati. Mr. Naidu has cheated farmers, grabbed their lands in the name of development and made the entire development a real estate venture. It is comical to see TDP leaders and real estate agents leading the agitation in the guise of land owners,” said Mr. Nani. The Minister flayed the TDP saying that the leaders had no courage even to hold the party flag. “There is no doubt that Mr. Naidu is the director, screenplay and story writer for the entire padayatra, and this marks the lowest point in his career,” the Minister said. The Minister said the padayatra could stoke communal passions as it had been provoking the people of BC, SC and ST communities. “This padayatra has a diabolical aim to polarise the people of the State on the lines of caste,’’ said Mr. Nani. The Minister took pot shots against some media houses for “exaggerating” the yatra and misleading people. The media houses failed to tell the real story as hundreds of farmers were cheated into giving their lands free and exploited by the real estate brokers, he alleged. The Minister said TDP general secretary N. Lokesh had no standing to criticise the Chief Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/padayatra-is-a-farce-says-nani/article37467395.ece

13 November 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||Wars are expensive, unaffordable: Ajit Doval||Wars have ceased to become effective instruments for achieving political or military objectives. They are too expensive and unaffordable, and at the same time, there is uncertainty about the outcome, said National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Kumar Doval on Friday. He was addressing the 73rd batch of the Regular Recruit Indian Police Service officer trainees after reviewing their impressive and spectacular Dikshat Parade (passing out parade) commanded by Darpan Ahluwalia at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy in Hyderabad. Explaining the importance of law and the safety and security of people, Mr. Doval said no nation could debate when rule of law had failed. People would not feel safe and secure when law enforcers were weak, corrupt and partisan. “Safety and security is your responsibility,” he said. “The people are most important. The new frontier of war – what we call fourth-generation warfare – is civil society. But it is the civil society that can be subverted, that can be suborned, that can be a divided idea, that can be manipulated to hurt the interest of a nation,” he said. “And you are there to see that they stand fully protected. The service of the people is the greatest service not only from the point of view of our nation-building but also from the point of view of national security.” Observing that technology was another frontier in which many of the trainees had to excel, Mr. Doval, a retired IPS officer of the 1968 batch, said these were vital elements in nation-building. “You are leaving this academy not only as police leaders but also as the soldiers of the new coming vibrant India. Without you this nation cannot succeed,” he said. “If internal security fails, no country can be great. If the people are not secure and safe, they cannot rise to their potential; probably, the country will never grow,” he noted. Congratulating the officers after presenting trophies to winners, he said: “Don’t forget the first word in Indian Police Service. You are for India and India is for you. Every other identity gets subsumed into this Indian identity. The interest of India should be supreme – the Constitution of India, the values, the traditions, the civilisations that this family represents.” Emphasising the importance of democracy and law, the NSA said that the quintessence of democracy did not lie in ballot box. It lay in the laws made by the people who got through those ballot boxes. “You are the ones who are the enforcers of those laws. Laws are not as good as they are made. Laws are as good as they are executed and implemented, and the service that the people are able to get out of it.” “If you fail to implement and enforce them, and the letter and spirit in which they were made, they were as bad or as good as they were made. So, the success of our democracy in the enforcement of laws that are given by the people to their elected representative lies in your efficiency, your commitment in your values, in your attitudes, and in your performance on the ground – implementation is more important than legislation,” he said. Mr. Doval said that he wanted the younger generation to not only think of reforms but also not commit the mistakes his generation did. “You have to be transformational. Now the police forces will have to bring about transformation, think about the future and find the solutions today.” Earlier, NPA director Atul Karwal presented the report of 73 RR batch to Mr. Doval. Dr. Ahluwalia, who was the overall topper of Basic Course Phase-I training and bagged the Martyr KS Vyas Trophy for Internal Security and Public Order and Field Crafts and Tactics, is the sixth woman in the history of the academy to command the parade. She is borne on Punjab cadre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/wars-are-expensive-unaffordable-ajit-doval/article37466904.ece

Amzath Basha has assured people that the overflowing Buggavanka poses no threat to colonies abutting the canal as the flow of water is well below danger levels. In view of the panic over the briskly flowing canal that passes through the city of Kadapa and the likelihood of submergence of the low-lying colonies, Mr. Amzath Basha undertook a visit to the canal accompanied by corporators and officials.

Venkaiah Naidu on Friday exhorted the media to give adequate coverage for agriculture, rural development, and empowerment of women. Newspapers and electronic media should have some dedicated space and programmes for agricultural issues, Mr. Venkaiah Naidu said while taking part in the ‘Tunga Panduga’ celebrations organised by the ‘Lawyer’, a weekly, on its 40th anniversary. Highlighting the crucial role of the media in protecting the democratic ethos of the nation, he urged the media houses to provide news and information in an objective and unbiased manner. Recalling the vital role played by newspapers during the freedom movement, he said many leaders, including Mahatma Gandhi, heralded social movements through magazines and newspapers. Thanks to the media, the Centre’s flagship ‘Swachh Bharat’ programme was a success, he said. “Today too, the media is playing an important role in building awareness among the people,” he said, and cited how it transformed the Swachh Bharat campaign into a public movement. Observing that the media should always uphold the values of truth, integrity and accuracy, Mr. Venkaiah Naidu said they should not succumb to other pressures. The Vice-President also lauded the journalist fraternity for working tirelessly during the COVID-19 pandemic and bringing awareness on COVID-appropriate behaviour and the need to get vaccinated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/venkaiah-extols-medias-role-during-covid-19-pandemic/article37467401.ece
13 November 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Poll code puts a brake on Amaravati farmers’ march||Farmers from Amaravati have announced suspension of their ‘maha padayatra’ for a day on Saturday as their route cuts through some poll-bound areas in Prakasam district on Saturday. “The padayatra to Tirumala will be resumed on Sunday from Yerrajerla village and it will continue up to M. Nidamanuru village,” Amaravati Parirakshana Samiti JAC convener A. Siva Reddy said soon after halting at Yerajerla after the walkathon on the arterial roads in Ongole on Friday, covering a distance of 18 km. Different sections of people, including farmers and farm labourers emerged from farms en route avoiding main roads to extend support on the 12th day of the padayatra. Police erected barricades at different places to regulate the crowd. After a tension-filled day on Thursday, which saw police wielding the lathis to maintain law and order, the padayatra was taken out in an orderly manner on Friday. Police, who had hitherto tried to dissuade large participation by local people, did not put any restrictions on Friday in the wake of the widespread condemnation of the lathicharge. “Save Amaravati” slogans rent the air as the farmers reached the NTR Bomma Centre in Ongole. Activists of the Telugu Desam Party were present in full strength to welcome the farmers. Activists of other opposition parties, including the CPI and CPI(M) fully backed the padayatra. Meanwhile, the farmers were pleasantly surprised when a 65-year-old woman, Annapurnamma, removed the gold ring from her finger and gave it to them, moved by the sacrifices made by them for building a world-class capital in Amaravati. All but for YSRCP had declared support to the walkathon, the JAC leaders added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/poll-code-puts-a-brake-on-amaravati-farmers-march/article37467400.ece
13 November 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||Police step up security for Sabarimala pilgrimage season||The Kerala police have stepped up security at Sabarimala in view of the two-month Mandalam-Makaravilakku pilgrimage season that begins on November 16 and concludes on January 20. Pilgrims from across the country and abroad are expected to trek to the forest temple. Only pilgrims who have registered on the Police Department’s online virtual queue website will be allowed. They have to produce a valid electronic pass or print out and furnish proof of identity at the checkpost at the base camp at Nilackal. Pilgrims should produce a COVID-19 vaccination certificate. A senior official said booking on the virtual queue system would enable the police to accurately estimate the number of pilgrim arrivals on a given day. The force could better regulate the crowd, streamline the deployment of officers and ensure COVID-19 protocol. He pointed out that an unpredictably high number of pilgrim arrivals could trigger a stampede along the steep hiking path, especially during the dark hours. Moreover, the police could not allow “unaudited” persons to enter the temple, given the security threat to Sabarimala. The police would allow up to 15-seater vehicles to drop pilgrims at Pampa and return to the Nilackal base camp for parking. They have banned private vehicle parking at Pampa for the current season. At the Sannidhanam, police officers in protective gear would help pilgrims to go up the 18 holy steps. Given the COVID-19 threat, police personnel would not touch or closely interact with visitors. The police would not allow any visitors to stay overnight or camp at the Sannidhanam. Access to the Sannidhanam will only be via Pampa. The police have closed the traditional Erumely and Vadasserikara forest trekking routes given the security threat to the temple and the need to protect the ecologically fragile forests from large-scale human intrusion. Inspections held The police, the Public Works Department, the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority, the Travancore Devaswom Board and the district administration have completed several rounds of last-minute inspections to ensure the safety and comfort of pilgrims.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/police-step-up-security-for-sabarimala-pilgrimage-season/article37466906.ece

Srikanth, they also opposed the Electricity Amendment Act-2021, which they said was meant to facilitate privatisation and that it would severely impact the interests of State government, the power utilities and the consumers. “All the neighbouring States strongly opposed the amendment to the Act and unanimously turned it down in their respective State Assemblies,” they said in the representation insisting that Andhra Pradesh should also follow suit. The members urged the department authorities to honour the terms and conditions of promotions, transfers, leaves and allowances, as was agreed upon in a tripartite agreement. Alleging suppression of initial and promotional cadre posts in AP Transco, they pointed to the increasing network expansion and said instead of creating new posts, the management was trying to reduce the entry-level and promotional cadre posts, which may put additional burden on the existing employees and increase in restoration time of the breakdowns. They said the career progression of engineers in all power utilities was very poor and they had been waiting for years together (stagnation: AEE to DEE 18 years and DEE to EE, 20 years). Forcible transfer of office-bearers, unnecessary disciplinary cases on employees and pending DAs from January 2020 were some of the other issues raised by them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/transco-engineers-body-seeks-solutions-to-long-pending-issues/article37466969.ece

13 November 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||State ridden with debts, says Kala||Senior TDP leader Kimidi Kala Venkata Rao on Friday accused the State government of achieving the dubious distinction of turning Andhra Pradesh into “Appulandhra Pradesh” (debt-ridden A.P.) in over two years of “misrule.” In a statement on Friday, Mr. Venkata Rao said the credit for availing loans amounting to Rs. 3 lakh crore within a short time would only go to Chief Minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy. “No other Chief Minister in the country has achieved such a distinction,” he said. “Every family in the State, whether rich or poor, is carrying a debt burden of Rs. 2.50 lakh due to corruption and financial mismanagement of the government,” he said. In addition, the government had been increasing taxes abnormally, the TDP leader alleged. “People are slowly realising how the YSRCP government is destroying all sectors in the State,” he said. A tractor load of sand used to cost Rs. 1,500 during the TDP term, he claimed. “Now, it has gone up to Rs. 5,000. The bag of cement had been increased to Rs. 430 only to facilitate huge profits to Bharati Cements,” Mr. Venkata Rao alleged. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy, who had promised not to increase power charges before the elections, later imposed a burden of Rs. 36,000 crore on the people in the form of true-up charges, he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/state-ridden-with-debts-says-kala/article37467403.ece

Railway authorities rushed to the site and restoration works were carried out on a war-footing. The train services were restored by 11.15 a.m. in the section. However, 08516 Visakhapatnam-Kirandul special train was short-terminated at Araku due to late running, according to Senior Divisional Commercial Manager A.K. Tripathi. Train no. 08516 Visakhapatnam – Kirandul special train, which left Visakhapatnam on Friday, was short-terminated at Araku and will return from Araku to Visakhapatnam as 08515 special. Similarly, 08515 Kirandul-Visakhapatnam special, leaving Kirandul on Friday, will be short-terminated at Koraput and will return as 08516 from Koraput to Kirandul. Hence there will be no services of 08516/08515 Visakhapatnam-Kirandul-Visakhapatnam special between Araku and Koraput on Friday. Intermittent rains Earlier, in the morning hundreds of tourists and passengers, travelling by the 08516 Visakhapatnam-Kirandul Special, were stranded at S. Kota station, following boulder fall from the hill slopes due to intermittent rains during the last two days, on the Kothavalasa – Kirandul line. The incident occurred between Chimidapalli and Borra Caves, around 5 a.m., resulting in damage to the OHE equipment. OHE cars from Araku and S. Kota reached the site. The special train, which reached S. Kota at 7.57 a.m., was controlled there. There were 800 passengers, more than 90% of whom were tourists, going to Araku by this train. Initially, it was thought that only a few large stones fell on the track but one was a boulder and clearing it took a longer time. At present only one passenger train is being operated on this route and the rest are goods trains.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/boulders-on-kk-line-cleared/article37467442.ece

Referring to the students’ fear that their school may close down, the Minister clarified that no educational institution could shut down without acquiring a “no objection” certificate from the government. And we will not allow any school to close down abruptly leaving the children in the lurch. If the need arises, we will take over the institution and run it,” he assured. To address the possible scenario of students put to inconvenience if a school had shortage of teaching staff, the education department officials are mapping the nearby schools where the children can be accommodated. The Minister said 90% of students were pursuing unaided courses and, therefore, withdrawal of aid would effect only 10% of them and “we will take care of them”. “This is a conspiracy by the TDP, BJP and Jana Sena Party trio which is trying to politicise it and make it an issue in the elections,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/managements-given-fresh-chance-minister/article37467402.ece

13 November 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Medical students move court||Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy of Telangana High Court on Friday sought to know if Kaloji Narayana Rao University of Health Sciences (KNRUHS) was inclined to hold a second supplementary examination for MBBS first year students who failed in their annual and instant examinations. The judge was hearing a batch of petitions filed by some MBBS students who failed to clear their annual and instant examinations. They contended that National Medical Commission (which came into existence since 2019) prescribed that multiple choice questions be given in the exams for students of medicine. The Kaloji Narayana Rao University of Health Sciences , instead of adhering to such NMC’s guidelines, introduced its own pattern of examinations, petitioners’ lawyer Unnam Muralidhar Rao contended. The exam model suggested by NMC evaluates the medicos’ competency based assessment. This system yield the double benefits of inculcating discipline among students and relieve them of exam tension. For some reasons, the Kaloji Narayana Rao University of Health Sciences preferred its own system of questions seeking descriptive answers both in annual exams and in the following instant exams. Additional Advocate General J. Ramchander Rao said the NMC had accorded an element of autonomy to the universities in taking a call on the pattern of examinations. Whether to introduce multiple choice questions or questions seeking descriptive answers was the prerogative of the university, he said. The judge asked the AAG if the university was willing to give the students another chance in the backdrop of the exemptions given in different spheres due to COVID-19 pandemic. Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy said some medical colleges had done away with the system of practical exams for post-graduate medical students taking into consideration the serious consequences of coronavirus first and second waves. KNRUHS standing counsel Prabhakar Rao said that NMC’s permission was required to take a call on the matter. The judge directed the university to inform the court of its decision on the matter by Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/medical-students-move-court/article37467493.ece
13 November 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||High Court reserves orders on quota for liquor shops||Justice K. Lakshman of Telangana High Court on Friday reserved orders in a batch of writ petitions challenging the State government’s decision reserving liquor shop licenses for some castes. Arguments in the pleas ended on Friday with Advocate General B.S. Prasad appearing for the government. As the AG presented his contentions, Justice K. Lakshman sought to know the rationale behind fixing 15% reservations for Goud community in allotment of liquor shop licence. “Why 15% reservation for Gouds?...why not 5% or 20%,” the judge asked. Questioning the rationale in fixing 15% reservation, the judge asked the AG what material had been placed before the State Cabinet to take such a decision. The judge noted that the three petitioners had challenged the GOs that were issued declaring reservations of 15%, 10% and 5% to Goud community, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes respectively. Defending the government’s decision, the AG said the Cabinet was empowered to take a call on such matters. The Cabinet, in its own wisdom, had decided that such reservation in allotment of liquor shop licence would help persons belonging to those communities, he said. He stated that Goud community people were into the business of tapping and selling toddy. Of late, the number of toddy trees had come down drastically and toddy sale was nearly akin to liquor business. Taking this into consideration, the government had granted 15% reservation to them as a welfare measure, he added. ‘No bar’ There was no constitutional prohibition on initiating such welfare measures for the uplift of Backward Classes. Mr. B. S. Prasad told the court that rights of petitioners were not affected in anyway as they did not even apply for liquor shop licence. The present policy of the government would be in force for one or two years, the AG said. The judge asked the AG what the fate of the beneficiaries of the reservation would be if the court concluded that the GOs were illegal. Mr. B.S. Prasad said the government would keep three out of the 1,834 open category liquor shop licences vacant for the petitioners if they wished to avail licences in open category. One of counsel for the petitioners questioned the AG’s argument that Goud community was provided reservation since it was socially and economically backward. A person has to pay Rs. 2 lakh at the time of applying for liquor shop licence and the annual licence fee would be up to Rs. 1.10 crore depending on the population of the area. How could a person belonging to a ‘socially and economically backward caste’ gather such amounts, he asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/orders-reserved-on-liquor-shop-quota/article37467494.ece

13 November 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||CM unlikely to attend SZC meeting on Sunday||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao is unlikely to attend the Southern Zonal Council meeting to be presided by Union Home Minister Amit Shah at Tirupati on Sunday. At a press conference a few days ago, Mr. Rao had said “someone” will represent the government if he was not in a position to attend. The meeting has been convened to sort out the pending issues between the southern States. The chief ministers of southern States as well as lieutenant governors of Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep have been invited to attend the meeting. Mr. Shah is scheduled to reach Tirupathi on Saturday and proceed to Nellore to attend a programme with Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu. He will participate in the Zonal Council meeting on Sunday and offer prayers at Tirumala next day before leaving for Delhi. Minister for Home Mohammad Mahamood Ali is likely to attend the South Zonal Council meeting on behalf of Telangana. Tirade against Centre The meeting comes at a time when the State has upped its ante against the Central government for its alleged refusal to purchase paddy from farmers. The Chief Minister has launched a tirade against the Centre for its “indifferent attitude” towards the State’s repeated requests on purchase of paddy. The Chief Minister had not hidden his displeasure over the Central government’s attitude and asserted that his government would mount pressure on the Centre till it backtracks its decision. River water sharing According to the agenda of the previous meeting slated on March 4 at the same venue, the Southern Zonal Council was scheduled to discuss about the river water sharing issues between the southern States. The issue had been included in the agenda of the previous meeting especially after escalation of differences between Telangana and Karnataka over the construction of Palamuru-Rangareddy Lift Irrigation Scheme and Nakkalagandi LIS to draw large quantity of remaining/surplus water from the foreshore of Srisailam reservoir. Karnataka went ahead to launch a complaint with the Central government against Telangana’s plans and wanted the issue to be addressed on priority basis. Coming ahead of the meeting was the response of Union Water Resources Minister Gajendra Singh Shekawat to the criticism of the Central government by the Telangana government over the delays in the constitution of new tribunal for redressal of grievances relating to the Krishna water.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cm-unlikely-to-attend-szc-meeting-on-sunday/article37467454.ece

Case re-registered The case was originally registered on February 12, 2021, by Dummugudem police, and later the NIA re-registered the case on May 2, 2021. An investigation by the agency revealed that the top members of the banned outfit including Hidma, Sambaiah, Madakam Kosi hatched a conspiracy along with overground workers (OGWs) to wage war against the democratically elected government by preparing to carry out terrorist acts, including attacks on security personnel. “In furtherance of the conspiracy, the underground members of the party, a proscribed terrorist organisation, are involved in procuring huge quantities of explosives, steel pipes, steel pellets, iron plates, lathe machine and other logistic items multiple times through OGWs for preparing IEDs, bombs, land mines and other indigenous weapons,” the investigators said.

13 November 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Agitation by ruling parties flayed||Congress Legislature Party (CLP) Leader Bhatti Vikramarka has charged the ruling parties both at the Centre and the State have been shrugging of their responsibility and coming on to the roads in the name of agitations. “BJP, which is in ruling at Centre, held dharnas before collectorates across Telangana yesterday demanding procurement of paddy from farmers by the State government. Today it was the turn of the ruling party in the State Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) to hold dharnas in front of government offices in all districts. Who has to buy the paddy produced by farmers if not the State or Central governments? Will the US or Pakistan buy the paddy from our farmers?” asked Mr. Vikramarka while speaking to reporters here on Friday. Charging both the parties with confining themselves to political gains instead of protecting the interests of farmers, the CLP leader said that it was shameful on the part of ruling parties taking up agitations instead of addressing the problem being faced by farmers. He has stated that both the parties have accepted that they are unable to rule and that was proved by their agitations. “Farmers are being kept in confusion. By demonetisation, the economy collapsed and now they are pushing it further down. This is nothing but a conspiracy to handover the farming to corporates,” he commented.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/clp-leader-criticises-agitation-by-ruling-parties/article37467490.ece

In separate letters addressed to the Engineers-in-Chief of AP and Telangana on Friday, Member-Secretary of the river board has sought details of Jurala, Srisailam, Nagarjunasagar and Pulichintala projects immediately. The river board has also asked for details of inflows and outflows including water release for irrigation from the four reservoirs during the last 30 years. Clarity is also eluding on the hydel stations on these four projects as AP has agreed to handover their (at Srisailam and Nagarjunasagar) management to the river board with a rider that it would do so only in the event of Telangana coming forward to handover the management of its hydel stations at Jurala, Srisailam, Nagarjunasagar and Pulichintala. Although AP has been blaming Telangana keeping the hydel generation on at Srisailam disregarding the water level in the reservoir since July this year, it too has been engaged in the power generation there for about two months now.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/give-details-of-four-projects-krmb-to-ap-ts/article37467562.ece

With the blessings of Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao we are enjoying our revenue and its diversion to Andhra Pradesh was totally stopped. Instead, Andhra Pradesh is struggling due to lack of money and Chief Minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy has been begging, literally. For day-to-day expenditure they are dependent on Centre.

13 November 2021||SIDDIPET,TELANGANA||Centre is taking farmers for a ride, says Harish Rao||Finance and Health Minister T. Harish Rao has alleged that the Union Government has been taking farmers for a ride and the TRS will stand with them till their problem is solved. He called upon farmers to tweet to PM, demanding procurement of paddy from the State. Participating in Maha dharna in support of farmers held at the RDO office here on Friday, Mr. Harish Rao said that while in the past dharnas were held for the formation of Telangana now it was to protect the interests of farmers. “All the problems related to water and power were addressed after Telangana State was formed and TRS came to power. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has been working for the welfare and well-being of farmers. Even fertilizers are being supplied to farmers whereas in the past there were agitations by farmers for power, irrigation and fertilizers,” said Mr. Harish Rao, adding that Bharatiya Janata Party leaders at Centre and in the State are contradicting each other on paddy procurement. Informing that party MPs would hold protest in New Dehli, the Minister said that agitation would be intensified in summer if paddy was not procured by the Union Government. He wondered why the Centre was so reluctant when paddy had been procured by previous governments for seven decades. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Harish Rao demanded that the Union Government hand over the Krishna water dispute to Tribunal without delay. “It seems that Jala Shakti Minister Gajendrasingh Shekawat took the comments made by the Chief Minister personally. We have nothing against him and all our intention is to protect the interests of the State. Is it not correct that the issue has been pending before Centre for the past seven years? ” asked Mr. Harsih Rao, stating that the case was withdrawn with respect for the Union Government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/centre-is-taking-farmers-for-a-ride-says-harish-rao/article37467492.ece
13 November 2021||SIRCILLA,TELANGANA||BJP misleading ryots: KTR||Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) working president and Minister for Industries and IT K T Rama Rao slammed the BJP leadership in the State for what he called "misleading" farmers by asking them to raise paddy in the ensuing yasangi (rabi season) in sharp contrast to the BJP-led Central government’s refusal to procure paraboiled rice from Telangana. “Farmers should not fall prey to such evil designs aimed at deriving political mileage,” Mr Rao said, reiterating that the TRS will spearhead a spirited agitation on the lines of the separate Telangana movement until the Centre agrees to buy paddy produced in the rabi season. Mr Rao, who represents Sircilla in the Legislative Assembly, led a ‘maha dharna’ organised by the ruling TRS in the textile town on Friday as part of State-wide protests demanding procurement of paddy by the Centre. Training his guns on BJP State chief Bandi Sanjay, Mr Rao alleged that Sanjay was misleading farmers by asking them to go for paddy cultivation in the ensuing rabi season. “While the Delhi leaders of the BJP dispensation are asking us not to raise paddy, the galli (street) leaders of the saffron party here are encouraging farmers to cultivate paddy in yasangi,” Mr Rao charged. “What will happen if all the farmers raise paddy believing their words and come on to the roads with their produce,”, he asked, saying “who will take up the responsibility in case the situation then goes out of hand.” The BJP leaders are hell bent on fanning communal passions for their narrow political machinations, he charged. He said: It is the Centre’s responsibility to procure paddy through the FCI and ensure food security for poor people across the country as per the constitutional provisions. The State government can only facilitate the procurement of paddy through the Civil Supplies Corporation and IKP groups, Mr Rao added, alleging that the Centre did not heed to the repeated requests made by the State government to procure paraboiled rice from the State and explore export options. "In the interests of farmers, we have sincerely tried to convince farmers to move away from paddy cultivation and take up cultivation of alternative crops in the ensuing yasangi, and several farmers in Sircilla constituency came forward to switch over to alternative crops," Mr Rao noted. Telangana government earned wide acclaim for its pro-farmer landmark schemes such as 24x7 free power to the agriculture sector, Rythu Bandhu, Rythu Bhima and above all enhanced irrigation facilities. As a result, Telangana surpassed Punjab in paddy production, he claimed. In a veiled attack on the BJP dispensation at the Centre, he said: “The BJP regime is on a spree of selling everything but refusing to buy paddy produce from farmers.” Under the BJP regime, India ranks 101 out of 116 countries in the Global Hunger Index-2021, behind our neighbouring Pakistan - 92, Nepal - 76, and Bangladesh - 76, he said. Referring to the recent Lakhimpur Kheri incident during farmers’ protest against the Centre’s farm laws in Uttar Pradesh, he said the BJP will pay a heavy price for its "anti-farmer" policies and "authoritarianism."||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-misleading-ryots-ktr/article37467500.ece
13 November 2021||SURYAPET,TELANGANA||SI suspended for ‘custodial torture’||Sub-Inspector of Atmakur (S) police station M. Lingam, prime accused in the alleged custodial torture of a tribal farmer from Ramoji Thanda Wednesday night, was placed under suspension on Friday. Superintendent of Police Rajendra Prasad ordered DSP Mohan Kumar to conduct an inquiry into the incident. After Guguloth Veera Shekar, a local farmer, was picked up by men in plain clothes from the fields on Wednesday, even as the family members remained clueless, police officials unusually called up the family late in the night to take him back. Mr. Sekhar’s family said he was by then in an unconscious state and fell ill from police torture. He was, with the injuries, later rushed to a hospital, they said. The police, however, maintained that he was taken into custody as a suspect in a theft case for inquiry and was sent back home as he was weak and unwell. The incident sparked outrage among tribal residents who surrounded the police station on Thursday and demanded justice. Following the tension and videos of the victim and the protesters going viral, senior police officials directed the police officer’s suspension. According to leaders of Kula Vivaksha Porata Samithi, Communist Party of India (Marxist), CPI(ML), Bahujan Samaj Party and others, sub-inspector Lingam had tortured individuals in the past too. Leaders of various parties condemned police actions in the name of interrogation. “Although the courts point to several excesses by police, there is no change in police behaviour towards general public. The SI and constables involved in the incident should be booked under SC/ST Atrocities Act,” CPI national secretary K. Narayana, visiting the victim’s family, demanded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/si-suspended-for-custodial-torture/article37467487.ece

13 November 2021||November 13 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||‘Pushpaka Vimanam’ movie review: Anand Deverakonda and Saanve Megghana impress in debut director Damodara’s film||The characters that inhabit the middle class universe created by debut director Damodara are people we might come across — seemingly well-intentioned folks who are nosy and judgemental. When things go well, it is easier to ignore their prying eyes. It is when things go awry, that one has to move heaven and earth to put forth a normal, happy picture. What if those steps backfire? Pushpaka Vimanam explores these facets through a dark comedy thriller that is also a social commentary on arranged marriages, societal pressures, moral policing, and finding love. At the centre of this universe is Chittilanka Sundar (Anand Deverakonda), a mathematics teacher at a government school. Almost always well groomed, well mannered, he is a tad naive and nurtures idealistic notions about marriage. When he is cornered later in the story, he would argue that he is a government school teacher, with the hope that it is enough to be his character certificate. The fun begins when he puts up a charade of normalcy, after his newly-wed wife Meenakshi (Geeth Saini) deserts him. Even the smallest of things turn out to be a nightmare. A comedy of errors ensues when aspiring actor Rekha (a crackling Saanve Megghana) poses as Sundar’s wife and an assistant director friend (Kireeti Damaraju) tags along when colleagues invite themselves to Sundar’s house for lunch. Anand is believable as the simple guy who struggles to cope with untoward happenings. In some of the crucial scenes in the latter half, his lack of experience shows. However, he makes up for it with earnestness. Saanve Meghhana dives right into the character of a small-time actor who is partly driven by greed and tries to find her way out of messy situations. She brings the hall down in a scene that unfolds in the residence of the school principal (Naresh) when the cops come knocking. Thankfully, the film sidesteps cliched possibilities in the portrayal of the rapport between Sundar and Rekha. As Sundar tries to trace his missing wife, the film enters a darker space. The transition from comedy to a dark thriller is not seamless but sets the stage for another oddball character — police officer Rangam (Sunil) who nurtures on-screen dreams. The narrative loses steam in the investigative portions. There is way too much focus on Rangam’s quirks than on building an engaging thriller. Kireeti’s character disappears midway and, surprisingly, the cops don’t think of looking up a victim’s social media profiles. However, the film manages to hold a mirror to how women bear the brunt of moral policing and how, after initial setbacks, two strangers thrown into an arranged marriage can find true love. These are all interesting ideas, but the narrative doesn’t bring everything together in an engrossing manner. A better screenplay might have helped to make Pushpaka Vimanam a quirky black comedy it intended to be. It’s not a bad film, it isn’t great either.

The two accused identified as Baikunthanath Naik and Bhimsen Moharana will be produced before the Sub Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Bhubaneswar, on Friday. Naik had posed as an assistant section officer while Moharana had posed as a senior official. They had assured 38 job aspirants selection to the State police force. One of the aspirants, Badal Kumar Raula, had registered a complaint alleging that Naik, Moharana and two others had cheated 38 job seekers of Rs. 1.47 crore on the pretext of enlisting their names in the supplementary selection list of Combined Police Service Examination-2013. “Investigation so far revealed that the complainant, Mr. Raula, and 37 other victims had appeared for the Combined Police Service Examination, 2013 (CPSE-2013) conducted by Odisha Staff Selection Commission for the posts of Sub Inspectors of Police, Sergeant and Deputy Subedar,” the EOW said. It said the final merit list of the selected candidates was published in December, 2016. “There was an impression that there would be a second or supplementary list. The victims, who had appeared in the interviews, were hopeful of getting the job in case of publication of any supplementary list,” said the investigating agency. As per the preliminary investigation, the fraudsters exploited this situation. The accused gave a false assurance to the victim aspirants that their name will be included in the supplementary selection list. In the process, Naik had shown them a fake identity card and demanded Rs. 5-6 lakh from each of them. “The complainant and others paid the amount to the fraudsters. During the period from May 2020 to November 2020, the accused took Rs. 1.47 crore,” the EOW said. Documents seized It was also revealed during investigation that Moharana had retired as Senior Grade Recorder from the Higher Education Department. During a search at Naik’s house, incriminating documents including 12 ATM cards as well the fake ID card of ASO were seized. “All his bank accounts have been frozen. Investigation of the case is continuing to identify and nab other accused involved in this case and other similar frauds,” the investigating agency said, urging others who might have been cheated by the accused to come forward with complaints.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/job-racket-busted-in-odisha-2-held/article37467368.ece
13 November 2021||Dharmapuri,||7 coaches of train derail in Tamil Nadu, passengers unhurt||Passengers of the Kannur-Yesvantpur Express train escaped unhurt after seven of its coaches derailed early Friday when boulders fell on them, following heavy rain in the past few days.

Divisional railway manager, Bengaluru, Shyam Singh, along with officials, visited the spot with an accident relief train and medical equipment van. The officials were later joined by a team from Salem and an ART from Erode. According to the railways, seven coaches in the rear, along with the passengers, were moved towards Salem and Bengaluru, via the Tirupattur route, by a special train. Special buses have been arranged by the railways in Thoppur for the passengers. The remaining three coaches were moved to Dharmapuri. A help desk has been opened at Dharmapuri, Salem and Hosur.

13 November 2021||Gurugram,||Fresh protests against namaz in open spaces||The opposition to offering of namaz at open spaces in Gurugram continued on Friday with fresh disruptions reported from a park in Sarhaul village. Muslim community members said Friday prayers were offered at 20-odd open places in the city after eight places were taken off the list of 37 designated places, including three mosques, by the administration. Altaf Ahmed, member, Gurgaon Council Committee, said activists of Hindu right-wing group “Hindu Manavta Sangathan” disrupted the offering of Jumma Namaz at Sarhaul village. He reiterated that disruptions would not end till the Haryana Government provides land to the community for offering prayers with dignity. Friday prayers were also disrupted at Sector 12A, Sector 43 and 47, said Mr. Ahmed. All three sectors have been witnessing protests for the past several weeks. The Sanyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti had also organised ‘Govardhan Pooja’ at Sector 12A last Friday, which saw the participation of BJP leader Kapil Mishra. Mr. Ahmed said attempts were made to disrupt namaz at a few more places but the police ensured the offering of the prayers. Representation conflict He said some right-wing groups had installed the Muslim Rashtriya Manch, a wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, as “so-called representatives” of Muslims in Gurugram and conveniently reduced the number of places where Friday prayers were being offered. “We have made it clear to the district administration that MRM does not represent the Muslims in Gurugram and have requested them to restore the number of places for offering of namaz to 37. We plan to call upon the Divisional Commissioner and are also trying to seek an appointment with the Chief Minister (Manohar Lal) in this regard,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/fresh-protests-against-namaz-in-open-spaces/article37467546.ece
13 November 2021||Mumbai,||Ideological warfare is a must, says Rahul Gandhi||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday said that the battle of ideologies had become one of the most important ones in today’s India, while accepting that the ideology of his party had been overshadowed by the “hate-filled orientation” of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). “It is important to understand why we find ourselves in the situation where we find ourselves. Today, whether we like it or not, we have to accept that the divisive ideology of the RSS and the BJP has overshadowed the loving, affectionate and nationalistic ideology of the Congress. Our ideology is alive and vibrant but it is overshadowed,” Mr. Gandhi said. He was speaking at the inaugural session of a four-day national orientation camp for organisation training at Sewagram Ashram in Wardha district of Maharashtra. Crucial stage Earlier, Sachin Rao, All India Congress Committee training in-charge, while explaining the background to the training camp, said that this was being organised at an extremely important and crucial stage for both the party and the country. He said that training is an important aspect of a party’s struggle against the forces of fascism.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/ideological-warfare-is-a-must-says-rahul-gandhi/article37467555.ece
13 November 2021||New Delhi,||Wrestler murder: city police nab coach, aide from Dwarka||The Delhi Police Special Cell on Friday arrested two persons, including the head coach of a wrestling academy in Haryana’s Sonipat district, in connection with the murder of trainee wrestler Nisha Dahiya and her 18-year-old brother, Suraj, at the academy two days ago. According to Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) Sanjeev Kumar Yadav, the accused — Pawan Barak, 25, and his accomplice Sachin Dahiya, 23 — were arrested from the city’s Dwarka area and one licensed revolver was recovered from their possession. While Pawan is a resident of Baland village in Rohtak, Sachin is a resident of Sonipat’s Kharkhoda village. Sachin was found previously involved in two cases under the Arms Act and he was arrested in one of those cases by the Crime Branch, Rohtak, said the police. Rs. 1 lakh reward The Haryana police had on Thursday arrested Pawan’s wife Sujata and his brother-in-law Amit in connection with the incident. The police had also announced a reward of Rs. 1 lakh on information on the whereabouts of Pawan. On Wednesday around 2 p.m., 20-year-old Nisha and her brother were allegedly shot dead by Pawan and his relatives inside the Sushil Kumar Wrestling Academy in Sonipat’s Halalpur village. Their mother also sustained gunshot injuries and is being treated at Pandit Bhagwat Dayal Sharma Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences at Rohtak. According to the mother’s statement, Nisha started complaining about three months ago that her coach Pawan was molesting her inside the academy where she was training. On the day of the incident too, according to the mother, the coach had molested Nisha and threatened her of dire consequences if she told about it to anyone. Nisha’s body was found near the gate of the academy and Suraj’s body was found around 500 metres away. Angry over the incident, the villagers of Halalpur had set fire to the academy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/wrestler-murder-city-police-nab-coach-aide-from-dwarka/article37467543.ece
13 November 2021||New Delhi,||HC dismisses DUSU plea against university’s admission policy||The Delhi High Court on Friday dismissed a plea by the Delhi University Students’ Union (DUSU) challenging the university’s decision to consider only Class XII marks for admission of students from the Kerala State Board, which determines the grades by combining marks of Class XI and XII. A Bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said the petition was “highly belated” and lacked merits. The court said it cannot pass any order on presumptions and will see if some student from Kerala files a petition with a grievance. “They have changed it, how can anyone grouch about it… If you don’t want to read the clear writing on the wall, then that is your choice,” the Bench said while perusing the June admission bulletin issued by DU, which said that if a candidate’s marksheet contains both Class XI and XII marks, he or she shall enter only Class XII marks. DUSU, in its plea, said it was approaching the High Court against the “arbitrary, irrational and unfair conduct” of authorities that have violated the fundamental and legal rights of innumerable students. It said that in terms of the consistent policy, certain State Boards, including the Directorate of General Education (Higher Secondary Wing), Government of Kerala, give combined marks of both Class XI and XII on the marksheets. The policy explicitly states that to determine grades of students, combined marks of both XI and XII shall be considered, it said.  Unilateral decision Advocate Ashish Dixit, representing DUSU, said Delhi University for several years correspondingly incorporated provision in admission bulletin stating that in cases where State Boards publish marks of both Class XI and XII, the merit of students shall be determined based on such consolidated marksheets. However, Delhi University has unilaterally and arbitrarily decided in its admission process of 2021-2022 that students would only be required to fill marks of Class XII, he said, adding that when the admissions began for academic session of 2021-2022, the colleges raised and conveyed objections concerning marksheets containing marks of both Class XI and XII. The plea was opposed by DU’s counsel M. Rupal who raised objection over DUSU’s locus standi to file the petition since the association only represents students of Delhi University and not those who have not yet taken admission here.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-dismisses-dusu-plea-against-universitys-admission-policy/article37467545.ece
13 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Teen beaten to death in group clash, 5 minors apprehended||An 18-year-old youth was allegedly beaten to death by a group of locals in north-east Delhi’s New Usmanpur area. The incident happened when the victim, Karan, a resident of Brahmpuri, intervened in a fight between his friends and the accused on Thursday, the police said. Deputy Commissioner of Police (North East) Sanjay Kumar Sain said five minors have been apprehended in connection with the case. The police said they received a call from Jag Pravesh Chandra Hospital that a youth had been brought there after being beaten up and he had been declared “brought dead”. When the police reached the spot, they met Karan’s friend Nitin Kashyap who narrated the incident. According to the police, Nitin said that on Thursday morning he was on his way to work at a factory in Brahmpuri when three boys started teasing him because of the way he walked. This resulted in an argument after which Nitin went to work. ‘Teased’ by accused In the afternoon, when Nitin was going to get his lunch, the three boys teased him again and when he objected to it, a physical fight ensued between the two sides. Nitin called his friends Sunny and Karan for help and the three boys called two others. The local boys overpowered Nitin, Sunny and Karan and beat them up, the police said. Karan was badly injured in the clash. “The friends took Karan to a private doctor but after seeing his condition, the doctor said the boy needs to be taken to a bigger hospital,” Mr. Sain said, adding that Karan was declared brought dead at JPC Hospital. A murder case was registered and after scanning CCTV footage and making local enquiry, five minors were apprehended, the police said. Karan is survived by his parents who are separated, a brother and a sister. His mother is a vegetable vendor and he was taking training at a mechanic shop.

13 November 2021||New Delhi,||‘Emergency’ measures under GRAP likely||The city’s air quality deteriorated to the higher end of the ‘severe’ level on Friday and is likely to continue in the same category on Saturday, according to official data. States in the National Capital Region were on Friday directed to be ready to implement actions under the ‘emergency’ category of the Graded Response  Action Plan (GRAP) to control air pollution, said an official order. A sub-committee under the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in NCR and adjoining areas, which gave the direction on GRAP, also advised Government and private offices and other establishments to reduce vehicle usage by 30%. GRAP is a set of emergency measures to be taken to reduce the air pollution depending on the level of pollution. GRAP was notified by the Union Environment Ministry in 2017 to fight air pollution. Actions under the ‘emergency’ category include stopping of construction activities and odd-even vehicle rationing scheme based on number plates of vehicles. According to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, air quality of the national capital has been ‘severe’ for six out of the eight days post Deepavali. The other two days had ‘very poor’ level of air pollution. Several other cities in the National Capital Region such as Noida, Gurugram, Faridabad, and Ghaziabad and towns in north India, including Agra, Fatehabad, Hisar, and Hapur, too faced ‘severe’ air pollution on Friday. The air quality worsened on Friday mainly due to stubble burning in neighbouring States, said SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research). “It is likely to be the same on Saturday due to increase in stubble-related fire counts and transport level wind speed during the night,” SAFAR said in a statement. Stubble burning adds 35% The contribution of stubble burning in neighbouring States to PM2.5 (a chief pollutant) in Delhi increased to 35% on Friday from 26% on Thursday, and the number of active fires went up to 4,056 from 3,914 a day earlier. “A drop in minimum temperature is likely in the next two days resulting in air quality to be in ‘severe’ to upper end of ‘very poor’ category. However, increase in local surface wind speed helps disperse pollutants. Winds at transport level are likely to reduce from Saturday evening leading to less transport of pollutants from the upwind region to Delhi,” it said. The AQI was 471 on Friday, up from 411 on Thursday, as per CPCB’s 4 p.m. bulletin. Meanwhile, the Delhi Government on Friday launched the 'Anti-Dust Campaign 2.0’ to control dust pollution. Environment Minister Gopal Rai said that majority of the sites were found complying with dust control norms during the first phase of the campaign and violators were fined around Rs. 1.3 crore. Mr. Rai inspected a construction site of the NBCC in Karkardooma and imposed a fine of Rs. 5 lakh for violations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/emergency-measures-under-grap-likely/article37467553.ece
13 November 2021||New Delhi,||Man held for posing as insurance firm employee, duping elderly||The Delhi police on Friday arrested a man from Ghaziabad for allegedly duping several senior citizens in Delhi on the pretext of giving them huge returns on their insurance policies. According to the police, Arun Jain, a senior citizen, was cheated of Rs. 9.09 lakh. Mr. Jain had a life insurance policy worth Rs. 26 lakh. The conman posed as an employee of the insurance company and gave an assurance to Mr. Jain that he will provide pre-mature policy return and took Rs. 9.09 lakh as processing fee, the police said. When Mr. Jain did not receive any returns, he lodged a case at the Anand Vihar police station which was transferred to the Cyber Cell. On tracing the accused’s bank details, the police found several accounts with PNB Bank, Bank of Baroda, Indian Bank — all owned by one Aadil, a resident of Ghaziabad. On an analysis of his bank statements, it was found that around Rs. 50 lakh had been credited to and debited from the accounts in the last 45 days. The accused was also involved in a case of assault in U.P., the police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/man-held-for-posing-as-insurance-firm-employee-duping-elderly/article37467537.ece
13 November 2021||New Delhi,||SDMC to set up plastic waste processing units||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Friday approved the setting up of automated plastic waste processing facilities at multiple locations under its jurisdiction. SDMC Standing Committee Chairman B.K. Oberoi said each facility will be able to process 100 to 200 metric tonnes of waste per day. “The idea is to set up these facilities in every ward [or every zone] to ensure that plastic waste is processed at the facility instead of sending it to the larger facility in Okhla. This will help cut down on the ferrying of plastic waste from one place to another,” said Mr. Oberoi. According to Delhi’s Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, the local bodies are responsible for ensuring the segregation, collection, storage, transportation, processing and disposal of plastic waste. Waste segregation Responding to a question on the ongoing efforts of the SDMC to ensure that solid waste is segregated by residents before its collection, as per Delhi’s Solid Waste Management Bye-laws 2018, Mr. Oberoi said people were cooperating with the civic body’s initiative. However, a few residents said very little had been done in terms of waste collection. “A civic body vehicle does come for its regular morning rounds but it hardly collects garbage from every house. This results in segregated waste being piled up outside our homes and we have no choice but to give it to an informal waste collector,” said a resident from East of Kailash.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/sdmc-to-set-up-plastic-waste-processing-units/article37467540.ece

13 November 2021||Hong Kong,||China’s Communist Party hails ‘helmsman’ Xi after ‘historic’ meet||A day after theCommunist Party passed a “historical” resolutionelevating the status of Chinese leader Xi Jinping on a par with its tallest past leaders, China’s ruling party referred to Mr. Xi as its “helmsman”, a title previously only reserved for Mao Zedong. On Thursday, anannual party meeting called a plenum passed its first “historical resolution”since 1981 — and only the third such declaration in its 100-year history — that extolledMr. Xi’s leadership and demanded loyaltyto ensure his “core position” in the party. The plenum also announced that the party would hold a once-in-five-year leadership congress next year, when Mr. Xi is set to begin a third five-year term, having already abolished term limits, from a position of dominance. On Friday, a seniorParty official further underlined Mr. Xi’s “core” statusand referred to him as the party’s “helmsman”, a term that only Mao had been honoured with. “This is the call of the times, the choice of history, and the common aspiration of the people,” Jiang Jinquan, head of the Policy Research Office of the Central Committee, said at a press conference in Beijing. “In firmly upholding and safeguarding General Secretary Xi’s core position, the party has its decision-maker, the people have their mainstay, and the giant ‘rejuvenation’ ship of the Chinese nation has its helmsman. And in the face of rough waves, we will be able to ‘stay on the fishing boat despite the wind and waves.’” He added that Mr. Xi’s ideological contribution to the party, called “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era”, would play “a guiding role” and “ensure the party can keep moving forward in the right direction.” Thursday’s “Resolution on the Major Achievements and Historical Experience of the Party over the Past Century” devoted considerable space to praising Mr. Xi’s leadership and called for the party to “resolutely uphold his core position”. It made several mentions of the need to “ensure that all party members act in unison” to support Mr. Xi as the “core”. This was the third resolution on history passed by the party, and the previous two marked significant changes in its politics. In 1945, Mao Zedong passed a resolution that moved the party away from Stalinist influence and marked the start of Mao’s decades-long political and ideological dominance. End of an era In 1981, Deng Xiaoping passed a resolution that marked a move away from the excesses of Maoism and a one-man personality cult to launch the reform era. In keeping with the shift away from one-man rule, Deng was called a “paramount” leader but not a “helmsman” and he eschewed building a cult of personality. Deng also left behind a legacy of what was called “collective leadership” with a ten year-term limit for his two successors, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao. The model ensured three largely smooth transfers of power, turning a page over the chaos of Maoism. The party, however, has now done away with both collective leadership and term limits, with Thursday’s plenum only the latest declaration of support to enshrine the status of its current leader as the party’s “core”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/chinas-communist-party-hails-helmsman-xi-after-historic-meet/article37466840.ece
13 November 2021||November 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Biden, Xi to meet virtually on Monday: White House||U.S. President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, will have a virtual meeting on Monday evening, the White House announced. The meeting, their first after Mr. Biden took office, has been in the making for a while. “Following their September 9 phone call, the two leaders will discuss ways to responsibly manage the competition between the United States and the PRC, as well as ways to work together where our interests align,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said via a statement. “Throughout, President Biden will make clear U.S. intentions and priorities and be clear and candid about our concerns with the PRC,” Ms. Psaki said. Mr. Biden had requested a face-to-face meeting during their September call, as per reports at the time. Last month, the two sides had agreed to a virtual summit by the end of this year, when U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met top Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi in Zurich. Earlier this year, while outlining its national security priorities, the Biden administration had said China was the “only competitor” capable of “mounting a sustained challenge to a stable and open international system”. It has also articulated a policy of cooperating with Beijing where necessary (such as in climate action) and competing when needed. The two countries have continued to have a strained relationship — with China’s growing assertiveness in the Indo Pacific, trade, actions during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic and, more recently, nuclear weapons, being key concerns for the U.S. Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi could also possibly discuss easing visa policies for each other’s journalists and the re-opening of their consulates in Houston and Chengdu, Reuters reported.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/biden-xi-to-meet-virtually-on-monday-white-house/article37466936.ece
13 November 2021||Washington,||U.S. clears way for spouses of H-1B visa holders to work||In yet another immigration-friendly move that would benefit thousands of Indian-American women, the Biden administration has agreed to provide automatic work authorisation permits to the spouses of H-1B visa holders, most of whom are Indian IT professionals. An H-4 visa is issued by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to immediate family members (spouse and children under 21 years of age) of the H-1B visa holders. The visa is normally issued to those who have already started the process of seeking employment-based lawful permanent resident status in the U.S. The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows U.S. companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China. A settlement was reached by the Department of Homeland Security in a class-action lawsuit, which was filed by the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) on behalf of immigrant spouses this summer. ‘After a long wait’ “This (H-4 visa holders) is a group that always met the regulatory test for automatic extension of EADs (employment authorisation documents), but the agency previously prohibited them from that benefit and forced them to wait for reauthorisation. People were suffering. They were losing their high-paying jobs for absolutely no legitimate reason causing harm to them and U.S. businesses,” Jon Wasden from AILA said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-clears-way-for-spouses-of-h-1b-visa-holders-to-work/article37466849.ece
13 November 2021||Bangkok,||U.S. journalist in Myanmar jailed for 11 years||A court in military-ruled Myanmar on Friday sentenced detained U.S. journalist Danny Fenster to 11 years in prison with hard labour after finding him guilty on several charges, including incitement for allegedly spreading false or inflammatory information. Mr. Fenster, the managing editor of the online magazine Frontier Myanmar , was also found guilty of contacting illegal organisations and violating visa regulations, lawyer Than Zaw Aung said. He was sentenced to the maximum term on each charge and ordered to pay a 100,000 kyat ($56) fine. Than Zaw Aung said Mr. Fenster wept in court after hearing the sentence and had not yet decided whether to appeal. He is the only foreign journalist to be convicted of a serious offence since the army seized power in February, ousting the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. Mr. Fenster has been detained since May. He still faces two additional serious charges in a different court for allegedly violating the counterterrorism law and a statute covering treason and sedition. “Everyone at Frontier is disappointed and frustrated at this decision. We just want to see Danny released as soon as possible so he can go home to his family,” editor-in-chief Thomas Kean said in a statement after the sentencing. “There is absolutely no basis to convict Danny of these charges.″ Mr. Fenster was detained at Yangon International Airport on May 24 as he was about to board a flight to the U.S.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/myanmar-court-sentences-us-journalist-to-11-years-in-jail/article37466846.ece
13 November 2021||London,||Assange given nod to marry partner in prison||WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been granted permission to marry his partner, Stella Moris, in prison, British authorities said. Mr. Assange has been held in London’s high-security Belmarsh Prison since 2019 as he fights a U.S. attempt to extradite him on espionage charges. The couple began their relationship during Mr. Assange’s seven years living in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden on unrelated sex offences allegations. Mr. Assange and Ms. Moris, a South Africa-born lawyer, have two young sons: Gabriel, 4, and Max, 2. “I am relieved that reason prevailed, and I hope there will be no further interference with our marriage,” Ms. Moris said. In January, a judge refused a U.S. request to extradite Mr. Assange, but he remains in prison while a higher court considers the U.S. government’s appeal. Mr. Assange and Ms. Moris made their relationship public in April 2020 and had applied to prison authorities for permission to wed. They threatened legal action against the prison governor and Justice Secretary Dominic Raab, accusing them of trying to prevent the marriage from taking place.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/assange-given-nod-to-marry-partner-in-prison/article37466844.ece

The large lake, straddling the border of the Democratic Republic of Congo with Rwanda, is one of many waterways in constant use in the vast country where roads are often not fit for purpose. But in changeable weather, with waves slamming the hulls of perilously overloaded wooden boats where safety rules are routinely ignored, shipwrecks often occur at a heavy human and material cost. The governorate of South Kivu province said there were “eight deaths, 20 missing and 60 people saved” in the accident, which happened on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/eight-dead-in-dr-congo-shipwreck/article37466842.ece
13 November 2021||November 13 2021 00:00 IST,||In Kashmir, a throwback to the ’90s||At Bohri Kadal, the spice market of Kashmir, the air was thick with the fragrance of spices. It was the second Monday of November. Just as the market closed for the day, unidentified armed militants, hiding in a dark alley, emerged around 8:10 p.m. They followed a local salesman and waited for him to open a parked car nearby. As Mohammad Ibrahim Khan, 45, climbed into the driver’s seat, the militants pulled the trigger. Khan, a loyal salesman of Sandeep Mawa from north Kashmir’s Bandipora, died. “Security agencies had told me during the day that militants might target me. I left the market around 3 p.m. in a different car. I had asked the salesman to get my car in the evening,” said Mawa, whose father Roshan Lal Mawa was shot four times in October 1990 but survived the attack. It was only in 2019, 29 years after his father was attacked, that Mawa decided to re-open the spice shop. He got a rousing reception by the Kashmiri Muslim traders on that day. Khan’s killing ended the brief lull that followed a spree of targeted killings by militants across the Valley in October. Fear has once again gripped the minority community and non-local labourers. A fresh bout of violence The flowers have started wilting in the mild autumn sun in south Kashmir’s Vessu area in Kulgam district, 65 km from Srinagar. The Vessu migrant colony has many rows of single-storey accommodations. It was developed by the Department of Disaster Management, Relief, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction and is a designated enclave for Kashmiri Pandits. Many Pandits left the Valley in the 1990s in the face of raging militancy, but some bravely returned and took up government jobs. In the first two weeks of October, watchtowers overseeing the boundary walls of the colony multiplied. Bunkers guarding the colony were wrapped in a tight net, to repulse any grenade thrown at them. Heavily armed guards in bulletproof vests man the gates round the clock. Only those known to the inhabitants are allowed inside. All visitors have to submit their identity cards at the gate checkpoint. The cards are returned only once the visitors leave the premises. Most of the daily grocery — milk, vegetables, bread — is delivered inside. “We have sought installation of floodlights so that the security personnel manning the pickets maintain eye contact with their colleagues during the night,” said a police official. The security bandobast and installation of floodlights have been approved for most of the Pandit colonies in the Valley located in south Kashmir’s Hall in Pulwama district, Mattan in Anantnag district and Vessu in Kulgam district; north Kashmir’s Natnusa in Kupwara district and Weervan in Baramulla district; and central Kashmir’s Sheikhpora in Budgam district and Tulmulla in Ganderbal district. Sanjay Raina, a teacher at a government middle school in Anantnag, decided to return to the Valley in 2010 along with his wife under an employment package announced by then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2008. “We were among the last Pandit families to leave in 1990. Our family left in May (1990) after close friends and neighbours started saying that all was not well and we should save ourselves for the time being. We faced indirect threats and left for Jammu,” Raina recalled. After a fresh bout of violence in October this year, only 18 families decided to stay back at the Vessu colony out of the 450 Pandit families that had returned and taken up government jobs. The rest left for Jammu. “Most Pandits preferred to leave for Jammu early October. The atmosphere had suddenly changed here,” Raina said, without qualifying what happened. Over the past few years, 3,841 Pandit employees, who took up jobs under the 2008 employment package for 6,000 educated Pandit migrants, started to bring their relatives and extended families to the Valley. They wanted the new generation to know about their roots. However, that dream is now shattered. It was around 12 p.m. on October 7 when Raina was asked by his Muslim colleagues to leave the school premises and head home, immediately after news broke on social media about the the killing of a female principal and a teacher. “For a week, we were not allowed to come out of the Vessu colony,” Raina said. For many, 2021 is like a replay of the 1990s. Raina is jittery. Till September, Raina, an early riser, would go on a one-and-a-half-hour run and exercise in a nearby industrial area in the morning. He would also go to the nearby Muslim neighbourhood for evening chats, take long strolls on the school lawns and frequently visit his apple orchards. All that has stopped suddenly. “If I see any unknown person walking towards me, I get scared. I had to change my timing and route towards school. My colleagues advised me against going on strolls,” Raina said. For the first time in 18 years, since the Nadimarg massacre saw the killing of 24 Kashmiri Pandits by gunmen in Pulwama on March 23, 2003, militants have carried out targeted killings. They left 11 civilians dead in October this year. The civilians included widely respected Pandit pharmacist Makhan Lal Bindroo, female Sikh school principal Supinder Kaur, Jammu-based Hindu teacher Deepak Chand, two golgappa sellers and three labourers. Unlike the past, the militant outfits, The Resistance Front and the United Liberation Front, claimed responsibility for the killings and justified the same in their statements issued online. The killings have once again disrupted the hard-earned goodwill between the two communities in Kashmir. Even the five-month-long street violence, over 100 deaths and a cycle of shutdowns in 2016, triggered by the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen ‘commander’ Burhan Wani, did not harm this relationship. “We felt no fear in 2016 when the streets were burning. It did not disturb our routine,” Raina said. Another Kashmiri Pandit recalled: “There were times when Pandit boys from the Vessu colony would play cricket in the fields with Muslim friends. Later, we were told that a few Muslim players they were playing with had joined the militant ranks. But there was no such fear.” This time again, the community is being forced to make some hard choices. Most family members of the Kashmiri Pandit government employees decided to leave for Jammu immediately after the attacks. According to the Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) government figures, 40,142 Hindu families were among the 60,000 families which migrated from the Valley in the 1990s. Among the rest were 2,684 Muslim and 1,730 Sikh families. A volcano waiting to erupt Locals believe that the shrinking political space, among other factors, has resulted in a sudden spurt in militancy in Kashmir this year. There are also many who see the J&K government’s push to reclaim Pandit property from Muslim owners or encroachers as a trigger for the new wave of violence against minorities. In the last week of September this year, J&K Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha launched a specially designed portal for Kashmiri Pandits living outside for time-bound redress of grievances related to their immovable properties. He said this was being done “to rectify the mistakes of the past”. The government machinery was directed to address the cases within 15 days of the filing of the complaint. Complaints from Pandits living outside J&K and abroad poured in. According to officials in the Divisional Commissioner’s office, over 3,000 applications from Pandits living outside J&K were received within a fortnight. In scores of cases, even eviction notices were served to owners, mostly Muslims, considered as encroachers and illegal occupiers. The J&K administration also sought details from Pandits about properties sold after 2007 to prepare a list of distress sales of properties. In 1997, the J&K government had passed The Jammu and Kashmir Migrant Immovable Property (Preservation, Protection and Restraint on Distress Sales) Act, which seeks to preserve, protect, and restrain the distress sales of immovable property of Pandit migrants. In March 2020, the requirement of written complaints for survey or measurement of a migrant property, proviso 2 of sub-section (2) of Section 6 of the Act, was omitted for speedy redress. The property cases were addressed on a priority basis. The authorities removed a Muslim owner, Sara, wife of Nissar Ahmad Reshi, after 15 years, among others. “The land recorded in the name of Prabhavati Raina, wife of Late Shambunath Raina, a resident of Vessu, was illegally occupied by Sara. With the eviction of unauthorised occupation of the land, the migrant breathed a sigh of relief,” an official said, after the eviction was successfully conducted by a local police officer and a magistrate in September. Sudhir Pandita (name changed), a Kashmiri Pandit in his late 30s, has been camping in the Valley for several weeks now, to recover the land occupied by three Muslim occupiers, after he heard that the action is prompt in such cases. “I have put up a complaint on the portal. The status still shows pending. I am hopeful that my issue will get resolved. I tried all other means to get back my land. Three Muslim families have encroached on our ancestral agricultural land. We are threatened whenever we ask them to vacate,” Pandita said. Sanjay Tickoo, who heads the Kashmiri Pandit Sangharsh Samiti, a body of 808 Kashmiri Pandits families that did not leave the Valley in the 1990s, sees such controversial property cases as a trigger behind the violence against minorities. “After August 5, 2019 (when the Centre ended J&K’s special constitutional status), the volcano was only intensifying without any vent in the Kashmir Valley. The J&K government started making claims of organising Hindu festivals for the first time, which is not true. Then, the property cases became a trigger for the fresh cycle of violence,” Tickoo said. The reclaiming of properties by Pandits from current Muslim occupiers or buyers or owners comes with its attendant problems, Tickoo said. “There are properties that were handed over to Muslims on the power of attorney but without registering them in the revenue records. Such owners are scared that they will lose property rights now. The distress sale cases post 1997 will also result in action against many Muslim owners. It will also annoy the land mafia in Kashmir. Srinagar city has most such problematic cases,” he said. Insecure at home Tickoo has stayed in Muslim neighbourhoods for the past three decades but he no longer feels secure. The condition of non-migrant Kashmiri Pandits can be gauged from the fact that he was shifted at midnight by the security forces on October 5 because they feared that he was on the target list of the militants. It was in June this year that Tickoo smelled a rat and wanted to convey his fears to the Raj Bhavan but could not get an audience. “There was talk on the streets that October will see a turn of events. It was like 1989-90 when our Muslim neighbourhood all of a sudden started talking about Pandits leaving the Valley. This time, too, the whispering voices came true. The community has been a target for a long time now. Unfortunately, the L-G administration could not sense and prevent it,” Tickoo said. For nearly a month Tickoo has been living at an undisclosed location in the city. He is not allowed to return to his home in Srinagar’s civil lines, where his wife and children stay. “Unlike the 1990s, militancy is faceless this time. The security agencies are yet to crack the cases and stop the trend,” he said. The Pandit leader, who braved many pressures and threats in the past, fears that the remaining Pandit population will leave if the attacks are not stopped. “Four Pandit families in Anantnag have already left for good. The new generation of Kashmiri Pandits does not want to live in this uncertainty. If there are more killings, the small Pandit population will leave forever,” Tickoo warned. A senior police official said pickets were being worked out in districts to safeguard Pandits. “It will take time. There are a few difficulties. We did offer five to 10 security personnel to a few vulnerable Pandit houses. Many refused because of accommodation issues. We need to set up accommodation for the personnel first,” he said. Putting up a brave face Besides Kashmiri Pandits, security agencies have been working round the clock to ensure that attacks against non-local migrant workers also stop. The deaths of five non-local workers — two street vendors, one carpenter and two labourers — have already triggered panic among the migrant workers. The second week of October saw labourers leaving the Valley in droves. This has impacted different labour-intensive sectors such as horticulture, construction, and brick kilns. Birendra Paswan, a resident of Bhagalpur in Bihar, was the first on October 5. The non-local vendor, selling golgappas in the old city’s Madeen Sahib area, was killed post sundown from close range, with the attacker making a video on his body camera. The wooden single-room accommodation where Paswan stayed in Alamgari Bazar remains locked. Scores of non-local Hindu workers, who came with him, have left the Valley but many find it hard to end business relationships forged over decades. “I have made a name for myself here thanks to my plaster designs, tiling and paint work. I have my co-workers at half-a-dozen construction sites at present in the old city. Locals trust me so much that I take advance money. I am in demand. How can I think of leaving,” Sanjeeb Kumar, 55, a resident of Bihar’s Darbhanga, asked. Kumar said he could get his three daughters married with the money he made. “Tiling, plaster and paint are three areas where the non-Kashmiri workforce is better. People prefer us for our fine work. Who will construct such beautiful houses here if we leave the Valley?” Sangram, in his 20s, and Kanaya Lal, in his 40s, are among the hundreds of non-local labourers who run over 277 industrial units at the Lassipora Industrial Area in Pulwama, which is known for cold storage, juice plants and cement floor tiles. “I am from Uttar Pradesh’s Azamgarh area. I feel as insecure in Azamgarh as in Kashmir. Fear is everywhere. But we are able to earn Rs. 700 per day here compared to just Rs. 400 back home. Besides, we get non-stop work,” Sangram, who works at Billo Tiles, said. Kashmir is heavily dependent on non-local workers to run businesses such as horticulture, hair salons, copper and gold designers, and brick kilns. According to the J&K Brick Manufacturers’ Association, over 80,000 non-local labourers work in the Valley’s brick kilns. “The sudden exodus of the migrant labour force has already affected the manufacturing capacity of brick kilns in Budgam. It’s going to slow down the construction sector this season. We are hopeful that the labourers will return by the next summer and we are able to keep pace with the demand,” Nazeer Jan, a brick kiln owner, said. An island of hope Away from the violence in Srinagar, Pulwama’s idyllic Haal area, around 35 km away from the capital, is fast emerging as an island of hope. A Pandit couple lives amid the ruins of around a dozen empty houses of Kashmiri Pandits, who left in the 1990s. Perched on an undulating highland with tall walnut trees is the house of Poornima, a housewife, and Ashok, an employee in the local postal office. A garland of marigold hangs from the sun-facing wall of the house, typical of Pandits in the Valley. “We have maintained very good relations with our neighbours. We just finished harvesting apples from the orchards together. I helped my Muslim neighbours to pick apples and they helped me too. We have never faced any problem,” said Poornima, whose son works as a junior engineer in the Valley. Tickoo has urged the majority community to come forward and help create an atmosphere of peaceful existence in Kashmir. “If one has to compare the role of the majority community between 2021 and the 1990s, I would say they failed us more this time. Except for a few mosques denouncing the killings of the minorities, we saw no spontaneous shutdown or street protests by the majority community. The civil society could not do much,” Tickoo said. He appealed to the authorities to allow Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, also a head cleric, to lead the Friday prayers at Jamia Masjid and help galvanise support in favour of the minorities. “Unfortunately, the government did not heed my request and the Mirwaiz was not allowed to lead the prayers. His statement would have gone a long way to create a positive narrative,” he said. School teacher Raina has one big fear. “Who will prune my apple trees if the security situation keeps me away from my orchards? My apple trees will get uprooted by a spell of heavy snow in the coming winters. If I am not able to nurse them in time, I am not sure if my orchid will be in full bloom again,” a worried Raina said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/in-kashmir-a-throwback-to-the-90s/article37466838.ece
13 November 2021||November 13 2021 00:00 IST,||The enduring relevance of Nehru’s legacy||Four men embodied the vision of free India in the 1940s — Gandhi, Nehru, Patel and Ambedkar. Gandhi’s moral rectitude, allied to Jawaharlal Nehru’s political passion, fashioned both the strategy and tactics for the struggle against British rule. Sardar Patel’s firm hand on the administration integrated the nation and established peace and stability. Ambedkar’s erudition and legal acumen helped translate the dreams of a generation into a working legal document that laid the foundations for an enduring democracy. Setting the way While the world was disintegrating into fascism, violence, and war, Gandhi taught the virtues of truth, non-violence, and peace. While the nation reeled from bloodshed and communal carnage, Ambedkar preached the values of constitutionalism and the rule of law. While parochial ambitions threatened national unity, Patel led the nation to a vision of unity and common purpose. While mobs marched the streets baying for revenge, Nehru’s humane and non-sectarian vision inspired India to yearn again for the glory that had once been hers. Of the four, Gandhi and Nehru stood out. Despite differences over both tactics (Nehru wanted Independence immediately whereas Gandhi believed Indians had to be made ready for their own freedom) and philosophy (the agnostic Nehru had little patience for the Mahatma’s spirituality), the two men proved a formidable combination. Gandhi guided Nehru to his political pinnacle; Nehru in turn proved an inspirational campaigner as President of the Indian National Congress, electrifying the nation with his speeches and tireless travel. Keeper of the flame Upon the Mahatma’s assassination in 1948, just five months after Independence, Nehru, the country’s first Prime Minister, became the keeper of the national flame, the most visible embodiment of India’s struggle for freedom. Gandhi’s death could have led Nehru to assume untrammelled power. Instead, he spent a lifetime immersed in the democratic values Ambedkar had codified, trying to instill the habits of democracy in his people — a disdain for dictators, a respect for parliamentary procedures, an abiding faith in the constitutional system. Till the end of the decade, his staunch ally Patel provided the firm hand on the tiller without which India might yet have split asunder. For the first 17 years of India’s Independence, the paradox-ridden Nehru — a moody, idealist intellectual who felt an almost mystical empathy with the toiling peasant masses; an aristocrat, accustomed to privilege, who had passionate socialist convictions; an Anglicized product of Harrow and Cambridge who spent over 10 years in British jails; an agnostic radical who became an unlikely protégé of the saintly Mahatma Gandhi — was India. Incorruptible, visionary, ecumenical, a politician above politics, Nehru’s stature was so great that the country he led seemed inconceivable without him. A year before his death a leading American journalist, Welles Hangen, published a book entitled After Nehru, Who? the unspoken question around the world was: “after Nehru, what?” Today, looking back on his 132nd birthday and nearly six decades after his death, we have something of an answer to the latter question. As an India still seemingly clad in many of the trappings of Nehruvianism steps out into the 21st century, a good deal of Jawaharlal Nehru’s legacy appears intact — and yet hotly contested. India has moved away from much of Nehru’s beliefs, and so (in different ways) has the rest of the developing world for which Nehruvianism once spoke. As India nears its 75th anniversary of Independence from the British Raj, a transformation — still incomplete — has taken place that, in its essentials, has changed the basic Nehruvian assumptions of postcolonial nationhood. Nehru himself, as a man with an open and questing mind, would have allowed his practical thinking to evolve with the times, even while remaining anchored to his core beliefs. The pillars of his imprint In my 2003 biography, Nehru: The Invention of India , I sought to examine this great figure of 20th-century nationalism from the vantage point of the beginning of the 21st. Jawaharlal Nehru’s life is a fascinating story in its own right, and I tried to tell it whole, because the privileged child, the unremarkable youth, the posturing young nationalist, and the heroic fighter for independence are all inextricable from the unchallengeable Prime Minister and peerless global statesman. At the same time, I sought to analyse critically the four principal pillars of Nehru’s legacy to India — democratic institution-building, staunch pan-Indian secularism, socialist economics at home, and a foreign policy of non-alignment — all of which were integral to a vision of Indianness that is fundamentally challenged today. Of these, it is the edifice of democracy that Nehru constructed that remains the most indispensable pillar of his contributions to India. It was by no means axiomatic that a country like India, riven by so many internal differences and diversities, beset by acute poverty and torn apart by Partition, would be or remain democratic. Many developing countries found themselves turning in the opposite direction soon after Independence, arguing that a firm hand was necessary to promote national unity and guide development. With Gandhi’s death, Nehru could have very well assumed unlimited power within the county. And yet, he himself was such a convinced democrat, profoundly wary of the risks of autocracy, that, at the crest of his rise, he authored an anonymous article warning Indians of the dangers of giving dictatorial temptations to Jawaharlal Nehru. “He must be checked,” he wrote of himself. “We want no Caesars.” And indeed, his practice when challenged within his own party was to offer his resignation; he usually got his way, but it was hardly the instinct of a Caesar. A deference to the system As Prime Minister, Nehru carefully nurtured the country’s infant democratic institutions. He paid deference to the country’s ceremonial presidency and even to its largely otiose vice-presidency; he never let the public forget that these notables outranked him in protocol terms. He wrote regular letters to the Chief Ministers of the States, explaining his policies and seeking their feedback. He subjected himself and his government to cross-examination in Parliament by the small, fractious but undoubtedly talented Opposition, allowing them an importance out of all proportion to their numerical strength, because he was convinced that a strong Opposition was essential for a healthy democracy. He took care not to interfere with the judicial system; on the one occasion that he publicly criticised a judge, he apologised the next day and wrote an abject letter to the Chief Justice, regretting having slighted the judiciary. And he never forgot that he derived his authority from the people of India; not only was he astonishingly accessible for a person in his position, but he started the practice of offering a daily darshan at home for an hour each morning to anyone coming in off the street without an appointment, a practice that continued until the dictates of security finally overcame the populism of his successors. It was Nehru who, by his scrupulous regard for both the form and the substance of democracy, instilled democratic habits in our country. His respect for Parliament, his regard for the independence of the judiciary, his courtesy to those of different political convictions, his commitment to free elections, and his deference to institutions over individuals, all left us a precious legacy of freedom. The American editor, Norman Cousins, once asked Nehru what he hoped his legacy to India would be. “Four hundred million people capable of governing themselves,” Nehru replied. The numbers have grown, but the very fact that each day over a billion Indians govern themselves in a pluralist democracy is testimony to the deeds and words of the man whose birthday we commemorate tomorrow.

13 November 2021||November 13 2021 00:00 IST,||NAM at 60 marks an age of Indian alignment||The birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru this month and the 60th anniversary of the Non-Aligned Movement prompt reflection on Nehru’s major contribution to the field of international relations. The concept of not aligning a country’s policy with others can be traced to the Congress of Vienna of (1814-15) when the neutrality of Switzerland, by which that country would keep out of others’ conflicts, was recognised. One world and free India Mahatma Gandhi, icon of Indian Independence, believed in non-violent solutions and spirituality, with India having a civilising mission for mankind which accorded well with Nehru’s desire to innovate in world politics and his conception of modernity. In 1946, six days after Nehru formed the national government, he stated, “we propose... to keep away from the power politics of groups aligned against one another... it is for One World that free India will work.” Nehru, the theoretician, saw world problems as interlinked; not a binary of right and wrong, but as a practical person, his instructions to delegates at international meetings were to consider India’s interests first, even before the merits of the case; this was the paradox of a moral orientation in foreign policy and the compulsions of the real world. In essence, Indian non-alignment’s ideological moorings began, lived and died along with Nehru’s idealism, though some features that characterised his foreign policy were retained to sustain diplomatic flexibility and promote India while its economic situation improved sufficiently to be described as an ‘emerging’ power. Nehru was opposed to the conformity required by both sides in the Cold War, and his opposition to alliances was justified by American weapons to Pakistan from 1954 and the creation of western-led military blocs in Asia. Non-alignment was the least costly policy for promoting India’s diplomatic presence, a sensible approach when India was weak and looked at askance by both blocs, and the best means of securing economic assistance from abroad. India played a lone hand against colonialism and racism until many African states achieved independence after 1960. India played a surprisingly prominent role as facilitator at the 1954 Geneva Peace Conference on Indochina, whereafter non-alignment appeared to have come of age. The difficulty was always to find a definition of this policy, which caused a credibility gap between theory and practice. In the early years, there was economic dependence on donor countries who were nearly all members of western military pacts. Indian equidistance to both Koreas and both Vietnams was shown by India recognising neither; yet it recognised one party in the two Chinas and two Germanies, and the Treaty of peace, friendship and cooperation between India and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics of 1971, fashioned with the liberation war of Bangladesh in view, came dangerously close to a military alliance, NAM’s failures When Yugoslavia and Egypt became non-aligned by defying the great powers and convened the first Summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1961, Nehru, who never endorsed confrontational methods, became a third but hesitant co-sponsor, because in theory, a coalition or movement of non-aligned nations was a contradiction in terms. According to then Defence Minister Krishna Menon’s epigram, true non-alignment was to be non-aligned towards the non-aligned. Nehru’s misgivings were confirmed when only two members, Cyprus and Ethiopia, of the conference supported India in the war with China. Among the Non-Aligned Movement’s members was a plenitude of varying alignments, a weakness aggravated by not internalising their own precepts of human rights and peaceful settlement of disputes on the grounds of not violating the sacred principle of sovereign domestic jurisdiction. Other failures were lack of collective action and collective self-reliance, and the non-establishment of an equitable international economic or information order. The Movement could not dent, let alone break, the prevailing world order. The years following Nehru’s death saw the atrophy of his idealism, and non-alignment during his successors moved from pragmatism under Indira Gandhi and opportunism after the dissolution of the former Soviet Union, to the semi-alignment of today. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party, by ideology, inclination and threat perception, is inclined to greater alignment with the United States whether under the nebulous rubric of the Indo-Pacific or otherwise. Longevity of organisations The Centre for Policy Research produced a document in 2012 titled ‘Non-alignment Mark 2.0’ which left no trace; the same body’s paper, ‘A rethink of foreign policy’, this year elides it altogether. Every international organisation has a shelf life, though many survive for years in semi-neglect. The League of Nations was given the coup de grâce after seven years of inactivity only in 1946, even after the United Nations had come into being. The Commonwealth will last only as long as the British find it useful. It is hard to see any future for Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (BRICS) or its various institutional offspring, given the state of India-China relations. The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) has faded into oblivion. Few among even our serving diplomats could tell what transpired at the last Non-aligned Conference or where the next will be held, while the symbolic anniversary, unanimously agreed upon in 1981  of ‘The First September, Day of Non-alignment’, has come and gone unnoticed.

13 November 2021||November 13 2021 00:00 IST,||The numbers game||The 26th United Nations Conference of Parties (COP) in Glasgow, Scotland may not have a significant outcome as yet in sight. Prior to the summit, there was a frantic attempt by leaders of western countries, particularly the United States and summit host the United Kingdom, to have most countries agree on a mid-century net zero goal, or when emissions dip to near zero or are balanced out by taking out an equivalent from the atmosphere. This put China and India, both major greenhouse gas emitters, on the defensive, and they dug in their heels more strongly on issues such as climate equity and justice. Their argument, that the climate crisis is largely due to the West because of over a century of unmitigated carbon dioxide emissions, and so those countries must bear the lion’s share of reparations in the form of finance and access to clean technologies, is an old one, enshrined over the years in earlier COP deliberations. While China has indicated a 2060 net zero year, India surprisingly agreed to a net zero year of 2070 as well as more initiatives by 2030 to move towards having a significantly larger share of its energy needs met by renewable energy. The target year 2070 is far from 2050, by when scientific consensus says, emissions must decline to zero for earth to have a fighting chance to keep temperatures at manageable levels. So India, now the third highest emitter of carbon dioxide, giving itself a 50-year deadline will unlikely help prevent temperatures from rising beyond the danger mark. However, India has also indicated that for its 2030 goals, it needs a trillion dollars, by 2030, from developed countries. India, it must be remembered, is a $2 trillion economy and expects to be a $5 trillion economy by 2024-25 — though the novel coronavirus pandemic has made it unlikely — and close to $10 trillion by 2030. Developing countries were collectively promised, nearly a decade ago, $100 billion annually until 2020 and only a small fraction has been realised. Even the Glasgow summit has shown how hotly contested every dollar is. The conundrum of global warming is that irrespective of how irrefutable the evidence is, it is unlikely that elected representatives of developed countries will impose punitive taxation on their citizens for climate reparations. However, a quicker transition to renewable energy sources may be made by enabling greater sharing of technology and at fora where countries discuss tariff barriers that impede better, cleaner technology from being adopted faster than they should be. In spite of the risks it poses, the climate crisis is yet to get political resonance in India. Unless it appears on electoral platforms, the push away from fossil fuel will not happen; and India might not have a realistic chance at adapting to disasters at minimal cost.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-numbers-game/article37466825.ece
13 November 2021||November 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Focus on full vaccination||Even as a small uptick in daily fresh cases has been reported in November, the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) has said no new variants of interest or concern have been seen in India. And variants other than the Delta one are now “negligible in sequencing data from India”. AY4.2, a Delta variant sublineage, which is slowly increasing in proportion to reported cases in the U.K., is, it says, “very infrequent” in India. In other words, the Delta variant, first reported in India last year and responsible for the staggering number of daily cases and deaths this year, is still the dominant variant. According to WHO’s weekly epidemiological update of November 9, the Delta variant has become globally predominant and “outcompeted other variants” in most countries; 99.6% of genome sequences posted on the global database are Delta. Even as the daily fresh cases have been on an overall downward trend since a peak in early May, the pace of vaccination has slowed down sharply since hitting a peak in September. The average daily doses administered in November have been just four million, the lowest since mid-July, despite vaccine availability. A greater concern is that only 38% have been fully vaccinated though nearly 80% of all eligible adults have received the first dose. Since full protection is achieved only with two doses, State governments need to pull out all the stops to increase the percentage of the fully vaccinated even while relentlessly increasing coverage. With Covishield accounting for about 90% of vaccines administered, the rate of administration of the second dose after the mandatory gap between two doses has always been very low. Despite people over 60 years and everyone above 45 being one of the priority groups included back in March owing to an increased risk of progressing to severe disease and even dying, nearly 43% of people aged 45-59 years and over 37% of those above 60 are yet to receive the second dose. Worse, about 10% of health-care workers are yet to receive the second dose nearly 10 months after the start of the vaccination programme on January 16. One reason could be complacency, particularly since daily fresh cases, hospitalisation and deaths have been dropping since the second wave peaked. The nearly month-long door-to-door vaccination campaign across the country this month to reach out to people who have been unable to access vaccines is, therefore, a welcome step. As proven in the universal immunisation programme for children to deliver polio vaccine, outreach programmes have a greater rate of success immunising the target population and in overcoming hesitancy and complacency. All proven and innovative methods need to be deployed to drastically increase vaccine uptake if India is serious in vaccinating everyone above 18 years by the end of the year and before a new variant emerges.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/focus-on-full-vaccination/article37466826.ece
13 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Small investors, salaried can now buy govt. bonds easily: PM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday kicked off two RBI initiatives to make it easier for small investors to directly invest in government securities, and provide a simpler redressal mechanism for customers of regulated entities such as banks, finance companies and payment service providers. “So far, in the government securities market, our small investors class, salaried class, small traders had to invest through banks and mutual funds in an indirect manner,” Mr. Modi observed. “Now, they can do it in a simple and safe manner with good returns,” he said. Taking on past governments for ignoring financial inclusion, he said: “Unproductive savings and informal lending was affecting the situation of common citizens and their participation in the country’s progress was virtually nil. “Till six years ago, India’s banking, pension, insurance... was like an exclusive club. The ordinary citizen, the poor, farmers, small traders, women, Dalits, backward classes — for all of them, these facilities were too far,” he asserted, contrasting that with the current situation where the government and the RBI had kept the ordinary citizen at the centre of their attention. The ombudsman scheme will provide ‘cost-free redress of customer complaints involving deficiency in services’, the RBI said. Stressing that proactive resolution of citizen’s grievances was the very cornerstone of democracy, Mr. Modi said an integrated ombudsman would help resolve people’s grievances.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/small-investors-salaried-can-now-buy-govt-bonds-easily-pm/article37466809.ece

13 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Oct. passenger vehicle wholesales decline 27%||Semiconductor shortage and high raw material costs continued to hurt the automobile industry with passenger vehicle and two-wheeler dispatches to the dealers in October declining 27% and 25% year-on-year, respectively, Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) data show. Passenger vehicle wholesales fell to about 2.26 lakh units last month, from more than 3.1 lakh units in October 2020. Likewise, two-wheeler sales slid to about 15.41 lakh units, from over 20.53 lakh units. Production of passenger vehicles also declined 24.6% to about 2.57 lakh units. Two-wheeler output fell 22% to 18.84 lakh units. “Manufacturers were banking on the festive season to recover from the severe drop in sales they have faced in the early part of the financial year,” said SIAM Director General Rajesh Menon. “However, shortage of semiconductors and a steep hike in raw material cost have been a major spoilsport to the industry.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/oct-passenger-vehicle-wholesales-decline-27/article37466812.ece

(VIL) on Friday reported narrowing of consolidated loss to Rs. 7,144.6 crore for the quarter ended September 30, on account of an increase in mobile services tariff and cost optimisation. The telecom operator had posted a loss of Rs. 7,218.2 crore a year earlier. During the quarter, VIL had raised the entry-level prepaid pricing plan to Rs. 79, from Rs. 49 in a phased manner, as well as increased the tariffs in some postpaid plans. Second-quarter revenue declined about 13% to Rs. 9,406.4 crore. The impact of the government’s relief package was not visible in the books of VIL as it was announced towards the end of the quarter. VIL MD and CEO Ravinder Takkar said during the quarter, the company had witnessed recovery in operating momentum as the economy had started to gradually open up. The firm’s subscriber base slid to 25.3 crore, from 27.18 crore a year earlier.

13 November 2021||Madrid,||Spain profits from Sweden’s slip||Spain, Portugal and Croatia all put themselves one game away from securing World Cup qualification, while Sweden’s hopes took a heavy blow with a surprising loss. Spain beat Greece 1-0 thanks to Pablo Sarabia’s penalty to overtake Sweden, which slipped to a 2-0 loss at already-eliminated Georgia. Spain hosts Sweden on Sunday in one of three winner-takes-all matches to decide World Cup places. Another decisive fixture pits Portugal against Serbia after a frustrating 0-0 away draw for Cristiano Ronaldo’s team against Ireland. Croatia and Russia also face off for a spot in Qatar after each had a big win Thursday. In Group A Portugal’s goalless draw in Dublin was less than impressive, but it was enough. The point Portugal earned against Ireland saw it ease ahead of group rival Serbia in the standings on goal difference. That means a draw will be enough for Portugal to qualify automatically when it hosts Serbia in Lisbon on Sunday. In Group B Sweden had its fate in its own hands in qualifying, and let it slip.  That gave Spain the chance to overtake Sweden and take the advantage ahead of the decisive game against the Swedes on Sunday. Spain had to work hard in its 1-0 win over Greece, sealed with a penalty, but moved one point ahead of Sweden. Spain only has to avoid defeat against Sweden in Seville. The defeat to Spain ensured Greece can’t qualify. In Group H Russia and Croatia each won big against overmatched opponents in games which were merely a warm-up for their qualifying decider. Croatia hosts Russia on Sunday and the winner will qualify for the World Cup automatically, with Russia going through if it’s a draw.  The results: Group A: Azerbaijan 1 (Salahli 82) lost to Luxembourg 3 (Rodrigues 67, 90+1, Thill 78); Republic of Ireland 0 drew with Portugal 0.   Group B: Georgia 2 (Kvaratskhelia 61, 77) bt Sweden 0; Greece 0 lost to Spain 1 (Sarabia 26-pen).   Group H: Russia 6 (Erokhin 4, 87, Smolov 55, Mostovoi 56, Sutormin 62, Zabolotny 82) bt Cyprus 0; Malta 1 (Brozovic 31-o.g.) lost to Croatia 7 (Perisic 6, Caleta Car 22, Pasalic 39, Modric 45+1, Majer 47, 64, Kramaric 53); Slovakia 2 (Duda 58-pen, Strelec 74) drew with Slovenia 2 (Zajc 18, Mevlja 62)   Group J: Armenia 0 lost to North Macedonia 5 (Trajkovski 22, Bardhi 36, 66-pen, 90-pen, Ristovski 79); Germany 9 (Gundogan 11-pen, Kaufman 20-og, Sane 22, 49, Reus 23, Muller 76, 86, Baku 80, Goeppel 89-og) bt Liechtenstein 0; Romania 0 drew with Iceland 0 .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/spain-profits-from-swedens-slip/article37466823.ece
13 November 2021||Dubai,||Happy I got the chance to reinvent myself: Wade||The ICC limited-overs knockout tournaments have seen the emergence of some unlikely heroes who have excelled under pressure and performed when it mattered most. Right from New Zealand’s Grant Elliott in the 2015 World Cup semifinal against South Africa, Pakistan’s Fakhar Zaman in the 2017 Champions Trophy final versus India to New Zealand’s Daryl Mitchell two nights ago against England, there have been players who have lit up the sky and outshone the stars in their line-ups. On Thursday night at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, Matthew Wade joined the club when he helped Australia stop Pakistan’s unbeaten run in the 2021 edition and advance to the final of the ICC T20 World Cup. Wade’s unbeaten 17-ball 41, which contained sensational scoop shots off left-arm pacer Shaheen Afridi, deservedly gave the wicketkeeper-batter the Player-of-the-Match award. What makes Wade stand out from the rest is the fact that he has been on the international circuit for almost a decade. In fact, three years ago, when he was dropped from the squad in all three formats, Wade’s international career looked over. Forcing his way back Since then, the left-hander has forced his way back as a specialist batter and even led the country in a few white ball contests. “I am happy I got the opportunity to go away, come back and reinvent myself. I feel like I belong at the international level now,” said Wade after piloting Aaron Finch’s men to the summit clash in the company of Marcus Stoinis. Having been in and out of the side almost right through, Wade’s career looks similar to players from the sub-continent than those from down under. “I don’t know when my last game will be. I treat every one like it potentially could be. I am sure when it’s all over, when I get the tap on the shoulder, I’ll look back on the last three or four years and be proud of the way I came back,” Wade said.  “It’s not the first time I have made a return. I have been been dropped four or five times, probably the most in Australian cricket. “I am proud that I was able to fight my way back. Hopefully, at the end of my career, I can look back on it and be proud that I could contribute to what we did.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/happy-i-got-opportunity-to-reinvent-myself-wade/article37466934.ece
13 November 2021||Sao Paulo,||Brazil qualifies with lots to spare||Lucas Paqueta’s instinctive strike gave Brazil a 1-0 World Cup qualifying win over Colombia on Thursday to book its place at Qatar 2022. The five-time World champion joins the host and Europeans Germany and Denmark as early qualifiers for next year’s finals. Brazil has produced a near perfect qualifying campaign, winning 11 of 12 matches — the only blemish a goalless draw in Colombia last month — to qualify with six games to spare. Brazil was made to graft as Colombia had the better of the first half, but an attacking tactical switch from coach Tite at half-time paid dividends as the Selecao dominated after the break. Colombia’s defeat saw it drop out of the four automatic qualifying positions in the single South American group as Chile overtook it after a third successive win, 1-0 away to Paraguay. Peru boosted its qualification chances with a 3-0 win over Bolivia to move two points behind Chile. Defender Piero Hincapie scored the only goal of the game on 41 minutes to give Ecuador a 1-0 win over rock-bottom Venezuela and cement its grip on third place.  The results: Ecuador 1 (Hincapie 41) bt Venezuela 0.   Paraguay 0 lost to Chile 1 (A. Silva 56-og).   Brazil 1 (Paqueta 72) bt Colombia 0.

13 November 2021||DUBAI,||ICC and the Afghanistan issue||Days before the International Cricket Council (ICC) Board discusses Afghanistan’s status as a full member after the Taliban took over governance in the country, Geoff Allardice, acting CEO, ICC, said the new government has conveyed that it wouldn’t stop women’s cricket. “They have said to us that women’s cricket will continue. They certainly haven’t given us an indication that it has stopped. Time will tell in terms of how that plays out,” said Allardice at an interaction with select mediapersons on Friday. “We have been in regular communication with them from the time things changed in their country. We are hoping to have some meetings with their representatives.” Next Tuesday, the ICC Board, apart from the Afghanistan issue, will look at the ICC cycle for the next eight years. About the deadline for resumption of women’s cricket in Afghanistan, Allardice played it safe. “I think that’s a bit premature. For the moment, the board is going to get an update on the situation and then think about taking any decision. It’s premature for me to speculate,” he said. Cricket Australia recently postponed its scheduled Test against Afghanistan due to the women’s cricket issue. Asked if the women cricketers not being allowed to take part would result in its men’s team getting suspended, Allardice said that the ICC will not interfere in bilateral arrangements. “Our goal is to see men and women playing cricket in Afghanistan. Our view is that the best way to achieve that is to stay closely connected with the cricket board and try to influence [things] through the cricket board,” Allardice said. “They are on a steady trajectory of development there and we would like to see that continue. “How other members react to their bilateral arrangements with Afghanistan is up to them. We will be working through their situation at both board levels. They are the agent for developing cricket in their country.” Allardice reiterated cricket’s importance in driving change in Afghanistan. “Afghanistan is our member and they are going through some change at the moment. We are just trying to liaise with them to ensure that cricket is being governed, and the board is being governed in accordance with their constitution,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/icc-and-the-afghanistan-issue/article37466915.ece
13 November 2021||Bengaluru,||Rahane to lead India in Kanpur Test||Ajinkya Rahane will lead the Indian team in the first Test against New Zealand at Kanpur (November 25-29), in the absence of regular skipper Virat Kohli. Kohli will return as captain for the second Test in Mumbai (December 3-7). No reasons given India will also miss the services of Rohit Sharma, Rishabh Pant, Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami for both Tests. The BCCI press release did not mention any reason for the omission of Kohli and the other big names. Middle-order batsman Hanuma Vihari, who has been named in the India-A squad for the South Africa tour, was a surprise exclusion. In his last Test, at Sydney against Australia earlier this year, Vihari courageously batted with a hamstring tear to save the match. Saha likely to keep Wriddhiman Saha is expected to keep wickets in the absence of Pant. The 37-year-old Saha last played a Test in December 2020, in the first Test defeat to Australia when India was bowled out for 36. Andhra’s K.S. Bharat, who enjoyed a good IPL season with Royal Challengers Bangalore, is the second wicketkeeper in the squad. Uncapped Karnataka pacer Prasidh Krishna, who was added to the Indian Test squad in the recent tour of England, has also been picked. K.L. Rahul is likely to open the batting with Mayank Agarwal, while Shreyas Iyer could take Kohli’s place in the middle-order for the first Test. R. Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Jayant Yadav form the spin attack. Jayant’s last Test came in February 2017, against Australia at Pune. The tour commences with three T20Is.  The squad: Ajinkya Rahane (Capt.), K.L. Rahul, Mayank Agarwal, Cheteshwar Pujara (Vice-Capt.), Shubman Gill, Shreyas Iyer, Wriddhiman Saha, K.S. Bharat, Ravindra Jadeja, R. Ashwin, Axar Patel, Jayant Yadav, Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna. (Virat Kohli will join the squad for the second Test and will lead the team).   The schedule: First Test: Kanpur (November 25-29).   Second: Mumbai (December 3-7) .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rahane-to-lead-india-in-kanpur-test/article37466920.ece

13 November 2021||HYDERABAD,||Gopi Chand launches his autobiography||India’s chief national badminton coach P. Gopi Chand formally launched his autobiography Shuttler’s Flick: Making every match count , co-authored by Priya Kumar, here on Friday. Later, Telangana Minister K.T. Rama Rao, who is also the president of Telangana Badminton Association, engaged the former All England champion in a conversation tracing Gopi’s journey into the world of badminton as a player and coach and as a human being. “My work doesn’t start and end on the court, it continues off it too. I keep challenging myself by not making the routines, discipline and training boring. I try to introduce variables, challenges and sometimes even fun to keep the players enthusiastic about the game as well as to not let their bodies slip into a comfort zone,” Gopi quoted from his book. He said it was virtually impossible to make it to championship level without a coach in any field, sports included. “You may be able to hit your target once, but to hit it 100 times you need structured practice,” he added. “As a coach, I have a 24x7 job with my players. My work is not an eight-hour engagement. I am responsible for what my players do in their training, practice and games. I am also responsible for what they do when they are not on court,” Gopi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/gopi-chand-launches-his-autobiography/article37467144.ece
13 November 2021||Chennai,||Will motivate the youngsters, says Bembem||Oinam Bembem Devi, the first Indian woman footballer to be honoured with the Padma Shri, is keen to use the recognition to help young Indian women footballers in the country. “My work isn’t done after receiving the Padma Shri. I will continue to work and help realise the dream of youngsters to get the Padma Shri. I will motivate and share my experiences with them,” said Bembem. “Even before receiving it [Padma Shri], I have been taking responsibility for the sport. I will take more responsibility and continue to make sacrifices for women’s football,” she added. On the right track Bembem feels the National team, ranked 57th in the world, is on the right track ahead of the AFC Asian Championship which India is slated to host from January 20. Thomas Denerby’s side will take on heavyweights Brazil (FIFA ranking No. 7), Chile (37), and Venezuela (56) in an international tournament later this month as preparation for the Asian event. “There are two months left and a lot depends on the coach. From the goalkeeper, defenders, midfielders and strikers, there is a process to get the coordination right. Playing against higher-ranked and stronger opponents, we will get to know their way of playing. “Losing or winning is a different matter in these games. It can be inspiring to play in the same pitch as someone like Marta. Even I had said, if I get the chance I would try to play and get photos with her. Now the younger players get a chance to play and gain motivation,” she said. On India’s chances of progressing beyond the group stages, the former India skipper said, “We can’t predict in football. Brazil [men] lost 1-7 at home in the World Cup to Germany. From the group we are in, if we fight hard it won’t be impossible to reach the knockouts.” The women’s top-tier league — Indian Women’s League (IWL) — has been put on hold since February 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Bembem, who had coached Eastern Sporting Union to the title in 2017, said, “The IWL is very important and should happen more regularly. I hear it [IWL] will take place in March next year. I appeal to the stakeholders, sponsors and private companies to invest more money in women's football as women can be equally good in sports. We need more tournaments in every State and it needs support from sponsors,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/will-motivate-the-youngsters-says-bembem/article37467148.ece
13 November 2021||SAO PAULO,||Hamilton sees steep challenge||Lewis Hamilton is running out of time in his quest to win a fifth straight Formula One title, and the Brazilian Grand Prix offers the British driver little hope of catching leader Max Verstappen. The seven-time champion from Mercedes trails his Red Bull rival by 19 points heading into Sunday’s race, the fourth-to-last event of the season. “I would imagine it’s as steep as it can be,” Hamilton said on Thursday about the challenge of catching the Dutchman at Interlagos. Verstappen won in Brazil two years ago, while last year’s race was cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Dutchman also won last weekend in Mexico and Red Bull is only one point behind Mercedes in the constructors’ championship. Setting the pace “Their pace was phenomenal in the last race. They have had a strong car all year. They have had the strongest car actually, you can tell,” Hamilton said. “Last time here (in Brazil) they were incredibly strong. We are anticipating again that they will be very hard to beat this weekend.” The traditionally unpredictable weather at the Sao Paulo track could have an effect on the race, though local weather forecasts say the rain is not expected to last into the weekend. Both Hamilton and Verstappen are good in wet conditions, but results can be unpredictable. Hamilton also said he has had difficulties with his car because of recent changes. “This year we have had our wings clipped. It has definitely been harder from an operational sense to maximise the car,” Hamilton said. “We will just try to focus on getting the car in the right window, and that is not easy. It is not an easy car to set up. It is really difficult to explain and to go into in terms of details, but it is just harder to optimise.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/hamilton-sees-steep-challenge/article37467153.ece
13 November 2021||Valencia,||One last hurrah for Valentino Rossi||A sporting icon rides into retirement on Sunday at the Valencia MotoGP where nine-time world champion Valentino Rossi’s name will grace the grid for the very last time. The charismatic Italian, 42, bows out with his place assured as one of the true greats of his or any other sport. “The hardest moment has already passed, when I made the decision to quit,” said Rossi on Thursday as he posed with all of the bikes which brought him his nine titles. “There is a lot of emotion, especially today when I see all my motorcycles side by side.” Rossi claimed his first world title in 1997, a year after making his 125cc debut, following up with the 250cc championship in 1999. Graduating to the premier class he was runner-up in his first season in 2000 before taking the final world title raced in the 500cc format a year later with Honda. Records galore He added six more in the new MotoGP class in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2008 and 2009, the first two with Honda, the rest with Yamaha. He leaves his stage with 115 victories including a record 89 in MotoGP, 235 podiums (199 in the top flight), also a record, and the longest career of any rider in the sport’s premier class. Inevitably for a man in his forties competing against riders half his age Rossi’s fortunes have waned in recent years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/one-last-hurrah-for-valentino-rossi/article37467379.ece

13 November 2021||Dubai,||Babar backs Hasan||Despite admitting Hasan Ali’s reprieve to Wade in the penultimate over was the turning point of the match, Pakistan captain Babar Azam backed the pacer fully. “I can’t even think about dropping Hasan Ali. He is my main bowler and he has won many matches for Pakistan. Players drop catches but he is a fighter and I will back him,” Babar said. “Everyone doesn’t perform everyday. It was just not his day. He is down and we will lift his mood. People will talk, but we will keep playing,” Babar added. Rizwan’s milestone Mohammad Rizwan, the highest scorer of the match, became the first batter to tally 1,000 T20I runs in a calendar year despite spending two nights in ICU in the lead-up to the semifinal due to a lung infection. Babar heaped praise on his opening partner. “Definitely he’s a team man. The way he played today, it was exceptional. When I saw him, he was a little bit down, but when I asked him about his health he said, ‘I will play’. “And the way he played showed that he’s a team man.

13 November 2021||KOLKATA,||Togetherness, team first approach important: Reid||Chief coach Graham Reid and captain Vivek Sagar Prasad on Friday underscored the ‘team first’ approach in defending champion India’s preparation for the Junior World Cup, starting at Bhubaneswar from November 24. Reid, who guided the Indian elite men’s team to its first Olympics medal in 41 years at Tokyo, stuck to his tried and tested values as he switched to coach the junior side. “Togetherness and team first are very important. In the last month I am (more like) a relationship coach as relationships with the players are important,” said Reid at a virtual press conference. Reid said coach B.J. Kariappa, who spent time with the senior team during the COVID-19 time, had been guiding the juniors well. “A lot of exercises, drills and terminology we used with the senior team has been dribbled down to the junior team.” The Australian said getting to know the junior players and communicating with them (as some of them did not know English well) were the two primary challenges for him. Drawing comparisons with the senior team’s Tokyo campaign without much match practice, Reid said it was difficult to know “where we are” and acknowledged the difficulty of not getting videos of the other junior sides. The Indian juniors, who moved to Bhubaneswar a week back after having a camp of five to six months in Bangalore, played some matches with the seniors on either side of the Olympics. “The senior camp is moving here (Bhubaneswar) in a week and we will have some more practice matches,” Reid said. Vivek, who led the junior side to podium finishes in the Sultan of Johor Cup and Youth Olympics in 2017 and 2018, looked forward to maintaining team bonding. “We will go match by match,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/togetherness-team-first-approach-important-reid/article37466926.ece

World No. 2 Sabalenka dominated early in the match to take a 4-2 lead, but Badosa recovered and won four games in a row to win the first set and then controlled the second with three breaks.

Swiatek, who won titles in Adelaide and Rome in 2021, is also making her debut at the season-ending tournament. “I think it was a very solid match from my side. Obviously my serve really helped my game. I felt quite good with the altitude. I could control my shots pretty well. I think every day I'll feel even better,” said Sakkari.

(No one really notices you anyway). Pause the murderer on TV, knife in air. Don’t even draw another breath unless you pay me full attention. The must-must is advice-giving at its most menacing. Musters are a belligerent species whose threat hangs over you: you must read this forward, or else you will go bankrupt/bald/bananas. Don’t pretend you haven’t ‘musted’. It’s addictive. I even embellish it further. ‘You must see this. You’ll love it.’ Ah, deliciously arm-twisting because who could turn down a gift of love? Instead, the recipient will feel ungrateful if she doesn’t love it madly and will immediately forward it with new additions: ‘You must see this. You’ll love it. It will change your life.’ In the aftermath of festival feasting, some innocent sent a joke about weight gain on a group chat. Aggressive advice pummelled her instantly. ‘You must have thyroid problems.’ And ‘You must stop eating orange foods!’ And ‘You must go to my fitness trainer. Now!!!’ A week later, the musts are still pelting her. She has nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. Someone else made the cardinal mistake of mentioning hair. Hair! Red flag to ‘musting’ bulls. ‘Thinning? You must apply curd, or you’ll go bald.’ And another, ‘You must use onions and karela .’ And another ‘Must try eggs. Only the yolks. Put the whites on your face, and the shells in flower pots.’ I myself have nothing against these good foods, though I’d rather eat them than wear them. The only time my hair had met food was when it strayed into the sambar I was secretly lapping up from the katora . My nose met it too. I am sure sambar must do good, all that vitamin C from the drumsticks. So, I musted with vigour, ‘Oh, you must try sambar , it has onion too.’ Meanwhile, I slapped egg yolk on my head, egg white on my face, eggshells in my rose plant. Instant impact! I frightened away a kid who came to collect funds for a noble cause. My bed linen smelt for weeks, along with the entire cycle of washing machine clothes, including inners, which meant we all walked with egg-citing secrets for a while. The rose plant died. As you know, it is quite futile to fight the ‘musting’. The ‘musters’ are a helpful tribe overflowing with milk of magnesia or other (organic) juicy advice. And what of those souls who sit back and smile, without thrusting forth their own ‘musting’? You must tell them how rude they are. They must eat karela .

13 November 2021||November 13 2021 00:00 IST,||TAP for art||If it is still raining this weekend, go online for an art break. The Art Platform India (TAP India) is showcasing Uma Shankar Pathak’s new painting series, Crossing Over , and Diya Mathur’s Mughal miniatures-inspired digital artworks. “In this series, Uma Shankar has worked on the theme of migration and transition, using images of the zebra and birds in flight to convey the idea of crossing over to another plane,” says Sharan Apparao, curator-gallerist of Apparao Galleries and founder of TAP India. “Diya is tech-savvy, and open to new ideas. I like her sensibility, especially how she handles the subject — placing Mughal miniatures within her landscape”. A year of learnings Apparao launched TAP India last year with 15 galleries across the country, as a platform to showcase and bring visibility to modern and contemporary art during the pandemic. While the past year has been one of new learnings — working with tech and using social media efficiently — it has also been about making art accessible. It’s encouraging to note that, with online access, the demographic of the collector is getting younger, she says. And with more younger artists getting into the space, art is becoming affordable, feeding the loop of bringing in more collectors. Mathur’s art is priced at Rs. 20,000, for instance. “The younger lot like a work they see online, they pick up the phone and ask for it. The system is transparent; the prices are listed, as are the contact details of partner galleries.” TAP India has also been growing their offerings. “We have added more galleries, and events such as Art Matters,” she says. Online talks by veterans range from art practice to curation. Such as Boon Hui Tan, director Asia Society (New York), who spoke about ‘identifying and defining shifts in the global art ecosystem’. “We are archiving our events now. The talks, valuable pieces of education, are on our YouTube channel,” she concludes.

13 November 2021||November 13 2021 00:00 IST,||‘There are things about me that are broken’||Netflix’s Red Notice (starring Ryan Reynolds, Dwayne Johnson and Gal Gadot) is, in many ways, the quintessential big-budget Hollywood crowd-pleaser. It has unrealistically charismatic leads (all three headline their own superhero franchises) and a simple but malleable plot, with bullets flying as thick and fast as the scene-ending one-liners. Reynolds’ character, Nolan Booth, and Gadot’s The Bishop are art thieves, while Johnson plays FBI profiler John Hartley. During a recent promotional event, Reynolds talks about the scene where the three meet for the first time, in a prison chapel. “For me, it was the most interesting scene to film. It was the first time that the three of us had shot in the same room,” he says, adding, “It’s where we meet Gal’s character, and she’s charming and funny and easy. In the past we’ve seen her as Wonder Woman and other really authoritative characters. So, to watch her be almost like a Cary Grant in this moment was really fun for me.” When Booth met Hartley  Speaking about the experience of filming an action-adventure story with Johnson, perhaps the most commercially-successful actor in the genre, he shares, “The way that you see Booth and Hartley talking in the film — you know, sarcasm and putting each other down, and yet there’s a kind of underlying respect there. That’s how Dwayne and I talk to each other in real life. If you go to dinner with us you’ll know.” The two have known each other for over 20 years now. “Weirdly, Dwayne and I have a lot more in common than you’d think. Certainly not body mass, but we each have three daughters, extracurricular businesses that we care deeply about. We both very much feel we’re in service of an audience and that they’re the boss, so we have very similar outlooks on life.” Indeed, the film derives much of its narrative frisson via the comedic repartee between these two actors. “There are other films that I have done where the emotional stuff, the tissue that holds together the action, adventure, swashbuckling parts, is much more prominent,” says Reynolds. “But in the action comedy genre, obviously the adventurous bits are front and centre.”  Deadpool and daddy issues  Reynolds has played characters like Nolan Booth in the past: quick-witted, sharp-tongued ‘tricksters’ who live on the fringes of society and follow the ‘trust nobody’ dictum. His current role as the Marvel antihero Deadpool, is perhaps the biggest example of this. Is he worried that he might get typecast? “Well, yes and no,” he says. “I think every artist has this in their career — where you do kind of the same thing but with different setups and in varied ways and hopefully, you get it exactly right a couple of times. What’s important is that you enjoy the work, and the day it gets to be too much, you take a step back and reevaluate.” In the film, both Booth and Hartley have daddy issues. Booth’s father was a Swiss cop who cared more about lost treasures than his own family, while Hartley’s was a con-man. Much is made of the fact that the cop’s son becomes a thief and vice-versa. “I think that in a lot of ways Nolan is broken,” says Reynolds, “The way he speaks, he obviously has trust issues, which come across in his scenes with Hartley… these things are his way of dealing with his past. There are things about me that are broken as well and I kind of use that to play these sarcastic characters.” On a break  Reynolds has been quite prolific of late. Earlier this year, his film, Free Guy , was one of the biggest hits of 2021, when Hollywood badly needed theatrical blockbusters to shore up flagging numbers. Then there was The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard towards the beginning of 2021. The upcoming Netflix film, The Adam Project , will make it four big-budget releases for him in a relatively short amount of time, which is why he has announced that he is taking “a little break”, not least because he wants to spend more time with his three children (ages two to seven). “The time that you don’t spend with your family, when you’re off doing your own thing, that’s time you are never getting back. It’s important to take a break once in a while, to allow yourself the time and the mental space to get creative again, and that’s what I am doing,” concludes the actor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/there-are-things-about-me-that-are-broken/article37466747.ece

13 November 2021||November 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Cheers to Mumbai’s pink guava||The first edition of Perry Road Peru was supposed to take Mumbai by storm last year, but by the time the country’s first-ever distilled cocktail in a bottle — a collaboration between Stranger & Sons and The Bombay Canteen (TBC) — was released in November, a lot had changed. With restaurants shut, the Pink Guava Chilli drink was sold via home delivery and retail orders. A year later, a second (and final) batch of Perry Road Peru has been distilled. Named after the perus (guava in Marathi) chosen from carts on Bandra’s Perry Road, the new batch will be sold in six cities: Mumbai, Goa, NCR, Bengaluru, Rajasthan and Hyderabad. Deliveries roll out this month. Before that, however, the collaborating duo is planning a series of ‘travelling meals’, pairing Indian flavours with the pink guava gin’s distinct sweetness. Chef Hussain Shahzad of TBC will be serving up dishes that represent Bandra and local produce. In Mumbai, the menu includes crispy bhel with pork floss, while at Bengaluru’s pop-up this weekend, diners can try black garlic handvo toast, podi b**f tartare, and more.   Perus for all seasons  Rahul Mehra, co-founder of Third Eye Distillery, the company behind Stranger & Sons, says, “It was only supposed to be a one-year release. But as we weren’t able to expand it to an all-India programme because of the lockdown, we thought of giving it a comeback.” How did the idea come about? “Both TBC and Stranger have been advocating for the cocktail scene in the country. So, when we came together, we wanted to figure out if there was a way to do a bottled cocktail.” They looked into the themes of India and nostalgia that permeate both brand offerings, and zeroed in on guavas. “Having guavas with chillies growing up was a memory that both teams had,” he says, adding that they joke about buying up the city’s entire stock to bottle the cocktail. In a post-pandemic social space where we are drinking at home more, the spicy-sweet offering is just right. More so with the country focussing a lot more on gin now. The spirit has “piqued a lot of people’s interests”, says Mehra, especially because of the range of botanicals available. It is also “easy to reflect what your gin should be, based on where you’re making it” — like Mumbai’s pink guavas bringing a richer story, underlined by the place’s history and cultural associations.  Two’s better than one  Across the spectrum, India’s liquor brands have been upping their collab game. Whether it be Greater Than’s No Sleep, with Sleepy Owl Coffee earlier this year, or Moët Hennessy’s recent partnership with Svami Drinks to create custom mixers for three of their signature spirits — Hennessy, Glenmorangie and Belvedere. For those seeking a caffeine kick, Mumbai roastery Subko collaborated with Pumori Gin to age beans alongside the gin brand’s botanicals, which they’re using to make coffee that’s available currently at both their locations in the city. There’s more planned with Stranger & Sons too, as the brand plans to launch another collaboration before the year ends. Mehra is tight-lipped, but promises two new bottles that are sure to be snapped up by home drinkers. All he hints at, since the collab is international, is that “we made our recipes on Zoom”.  A bottle of Perry Road Peru costs Rs. 2,999 in Mumbai. This weekend’s pop-up in Bengaluru is at The Courtyard in Shanti Nagar, from 7 pm. Rs. 4,950 per person.

13 November 2021||November 13 2021 00:00 IST,||The delights of Diwali||Are you still recovering from the excesses of Diwali? I am, too. It was particularly stressful this year because I was determined to have a politically correct Diwali. This meant that first I had to buy a huge number of crackers guaranteed to make the air around my home hang like a grey pall for at least 12 hours while simultaneously deafening my neighbours. It took some effort and a lot of money, but I managed it. With help from my spouse, my child, my watchman and family, and neighbourhood volunteers. Second, I wanted to make sure my Diwali was linguistically and genealogically correct. I wondered for a long time whether or not to light diyas because someone told me diya was an Urdu word. But I decided to take research into my own able hands and voila, my problems were solved. Did you know that ancient Indians had gone to the Horn of Africa and given the people there the idea for earthen lamps? That country was thenceforth called Djibouti, whose name comes from diya (lamp) + jiba (life). Lighting diyas is therefore good because it rightly recalls this glorious past. Lighting tooni bulbs or fairy lights was a much easier decision because, of course, fromMahabharatatimes we have been importing these from Tunisia to use as streetlights and that makes them very ethnic chic. I must confess I knew nothing of this rich history until I happened to hear a Sri Sri Ravi Shankar lecture where a disciple asks him where the warriors in theMahabharatagot their weapons from and he replies that they came from an astralaya or armoury, which was actually the Sanskrit name for Australia. The scales fell from my eyes and all of etymology became clear in a flash. Since then, I have been following in Sri Square’s hallowed steps. When it comes to snacks, Mysorepakand Madras mixture are easy, their origins are crystal clear. But what aboutladdu? What aboutkaju katli? Well, ancient Mahabharatiyan women used to eat small balls made from chickpea flour to break their Kadva Chauth fasts. These balls came from Latvia and were called Latvoos, which slowly got Indianified toladdus. So that’s a safe bet. As arekaju katlis. Cashews were much loved by Indian travelling monks who introduced them to Central Asian nomads who loved them so much they decided to call their country Kazakhstan because they used to pronounce kaju as kazu.  Sweets were getting easier and easier to be patriotic about. A friend of ours landed up with mini cheesecakes and then apologised profusely. He had not realised I was on a Mission Implausible. I reassured him. Cheese, I reminded him, had been invented in India and dated back to Kamadhenu times. So anything to do with cheese is per se desi. But what about savouries? Well, I decided to go with tiny tri-coloured sandwiches because sandwiches were invented by a British earl and the British Raj ruled India so it was as good as invented by an Indian earl. From there to Earl Grey tea was a tiny leap. I wondered if someone might object tosamosas; after all they are supposed to have come from Iran, where they were stuffed with minced meat and called sambosa . But what if history is wrong? What if our warriors, while bringing back weapons from Astralaya, decided to visit an island nearby called Samoa where they found the natives chomping away on some potato-stuffed conical snacks? It stands to reason that they cocked their culinary ears, stole the recipe, returned home, and named itsamosa. Now that décor and food were solved, I turned my attention to clothing. Even though duringMahabharatatimes India was importing cloths from Vastralaya, nowadays we have becomeatma nirbhar. I warned everyone not to stitch anything because Bhaarateeya Samskaaraa forbids it. So we tookdhotisanddupattasand saris and fastened them with safety pins in elegant shapes and draped ourselves. Sometimes it got a little windy in some parts of the body, but overall we managed. And, of course, we wore at least 6-7bindiseach. Like Sudha Chandran in Kahin Kisi Roz. As you can see, my dog might be a mongrel, but nobody dares question my Diwali party’s pedigree anymore. Where the writer tries to make sense of society with seven hundred words and a bit of snark.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/the-delights-of-diwali/article37466750.ece
13 November 2021||November 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Raw Mango: talking in threes||“If you had to make a love potion, what would it smell like?” Garg has laughingly accused me of pushing him with my questions in all our interactions, so I push my luck a little bit more. Fragrances are one of the biggest tells of a person. And I’m sniffing for a story. He takes the bait. “Something mysterious and smokey, like ash. But also orange blossoms, freshly-cut grass and water.” Nothing about roses! Garg is very specific, knowledgeable, perhaps India’s biggest boundary-pushing designer, and highly opinionated. He’s previously confessed that if he didn’t have a textile and fashion brand, he would be an activist. For the last couple of seasons, he has been letting his campaigns speak his mind. After ‘Other’ — his SS21 offering that featured models in hyper-real, painted faces in surreal locations with spooky music (that got the online troll army working extra hours) — I wonder if he’s trying to soften the mood with this romantic take. Actually, scratch that.  Something about Shimla  Romantics’ campaign was launched as a five-part video series, shot by photographer Ashish Shah at Shimla’s Chapslee hotel, former summer residence of the late Raja Charanjit Singh of Kapurthala. It’s not just a pretty location. Kapurthalas were Indian royals, but known to be influenced by European culture, mixing Indian and western aesthetics — Garg’s manifesto for this line. The muse? Beloved Hungarian-Indian painter Amrita Sher-Gil who spent a large amount of time in Shimla, and was famous for both her realistic portraits and her love life. Sher-Gil was openly bisexual. Romantics’ imagery features three models: two girls and a man living out their best throuple life in a Rococo-inspired cottage. Garg says he doesn’t think of them (who he has named Madhavi, Jamshed and Ruth in his head) as a modern couple. “They are just young people exploring their sexuality and different facets of love.” The videos are shorts, but tell a whole story about a time in the three people’s lives in a signature Raw Mango nostalgia palette. “Sometimes love is just someone understanding you like no one else has. And sometimes it’s how the light falls,” he shares. The first short starts out innocently with Jamshed enjoying a slow day of reading. By the fifth one, we are at one of Indian fashion’s first campaigns suggesting the possibility of a threesome.  Eyes of the beholder  ‘Will you ever design a full ‘western wear’ prêt collection?’ Ever the contrarian, Garg corrects me. “There is no such thing as Indian or western silhouettes. It’s all a big blur now. India has always been a drape country. Pyjamas and chu r idars are outside influences, too. Blouse is not an Indian word.” Romantics features saris, corset-inspired blouses, lehengas , and maxis in sheer organza accented with pearl and bead work. The European Rococo movement focussed on the most exquisite brocade from Italy and France; a textile that has now become synonymous with India, and that Garg has dedicated his brand to. The ‘Varanasi brocade’ in Romantics features woven bows, delicate flora and fauna. The jewellery is from Hanut Singh, grandson of the Kapurthala lineage. It all comes together seamlessly, with meaning. His usual lemons, neons and jewel tones don’t find space — it’s pared down to black, ivory, blush, mint green and powder blues, which he refers to as aasmani (of the sky). Some of his more contemporary silhouettes in stiff brocade are also a new playing field, a dare even. Rococo, known as the age of Enlightenment, birthed new ideas about existence and living, and carried within it the human spirit’s need for optimism and perhaps even frivolity. Garg has often reminded me that many Indias exist within this country, and with Romantics he’s talking about an India (and mind) that was free, before it forgot.

13 November 2021||November 13 2021 00:00 IST,||TAP for art||If it is still raining this weekend, go online for an art break. The Art Platform India (TAP India) is showcasing Uma Shankar Pathak’s new painting series, Crossing Over , and Diya Mathur’s Mughal miniatures-inspired digital artworks. “In this series, Uma Shankar has worked on the theme of migration and transition, using images of the zebra and birds in flight to convey the idea of crossing over to another plane,” says Sharan Apparao, curator-gallerist of Apparao Galleries and founder of TAP India. “Diya is tech-savvy, and open to new ideas. I like her sensibility, especially how she handles the subject — placing Mughal miniatures within her landscape”. A year of learnings Apparao launched TAP India last year with 15 galleries across the country, as a platform to showcase and bring visibility to modern and contemporary art during the pandemic. While the past year has been one of new learnings — working with tech and using social media efficiently — it has also been about making art accessible. It’s encouraging to note that, with online access, the demographic of the collector is getting younger, she says. And with more younger artists getting into the space, art is becoming affordable, feeding the loop of bringing in more collectors. Mathur’s art is priced at Rs. 20,000, for instance. “The younger lot like a work they see online, they pick up the phone and ask for it. The system is transparent; the prices are listed, as are the contact details of partner galleries.” TAP India has also been growing their offerings. “We have added more galleries, and events such as Art Matters,” she says.

13 November 2021||November 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Why Dwayne Johnson’s still The Rock||There are few things that are worth a 4 am wake-up call. Speaking to one of the biggest movie stars in the world (even if it is on Zoom) is one of them. When Dwayne Johnson appears on my screen, he’s three hours late. It’s been a mad rush, with the LA premiere of his new film Red Notice followed by a schedule packed with interviews (organised by Netflix to promote said film) — mine being the last for the day. But his trademark smile is at the ready. It’s this sense of warmth that draws people in and which, with a keen business sense, has made the 49-year-old either the highest or second-highest paid actor for the last five years, according to Forbes ’ annual list — with an estimated total earning of $430.4 million. “I think the reason why he’s adored is because he is adoring of other people,” Oprah Winfrey recently told Vanity Fair magazine. “He really is what he appears to be. And people know that.” We can see this, for instance, in how he works social media to his advantage. His feed is peppered with his workouts and famous pancake cheat meals, brand endorsements and film promotions. There are photos, too, of him giving his five-year-old daughter, Jasmine, a manicure. After the perfectly-curated Instagram profiles of influencers, this comes across as a busy, joyful mess. But it’s one that you want to be a part of. In a clip that has 6.6 million views, Johnson pulls up in his pickup truck next to a tour bus driving through his Hollywood neighbourhood. “Can you tell me where I can find The Rock?” he asks, as the tourists go wild. In the same Vanity Fair story, he explains, “There was a time when no one knew who I was... I roll the windows down as a reminder. What an incredible position to be in. You got a chance to make somebody’s day.”  Thinking about tutus  As he settles down for our chat — his casual grey T-shirt a nice contrast to the previous day’s purple Ralph Lauren jacket on the red carpet — we begin with The Game Plan (2007). One of my go-to feel-good films, it is the last one where he is credited with his WWE stage name, ‘The Rock’. “I had a lot of fun doing that movie,” Johnson says. “It was a seminal moment in my career.” It not only marked a departure from being identified as a former wrestling star to being acknowledged as an actor in his own right, but the movie, produced by Disney, also showcased his versatility. As star quarterback Joe Kingman, he plays a typical jock, though by the end of the family comedy, he’s in a tutu, prancing about in a ballet recital. As it turns out,all that dancing was good practice for Red Notice . In a press conference earlier in the day, co-star Gal Gadot playfully recalls a scene where they dance. “I was quite afraid for my feet,” she laughs, as he adds, “She thought she was dancing with a Velociraptor.” Despite his 6’4” muscled frame “he is light on his feet, like a ballerina”, she says.  Art for art’s sake  Johnson plays FBI profiler John Hartley in the art heist film directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber. This is the third time he is collaborating with Thurber, after Central Intelligence and Skyscraper, and their camaraderie on set is well-documented. As is the cutting-edge technology they both enjoy working with. In a recent interview with comicbook.com, Thurber refers to the Komodo, a 6K camera that they attached to a race drone to shoot immersive sequences — like the opening shot where he ‘flies’ the audience over a bridge to Johnson standing at the door of a museum, and the subsequent chase. It brings to mind that Johnson is often surrounded by relics and artefacts in his films (think the Jumanji films or the more recent Amazon adventureJungle Cruise ). The actor says, “I’ve always had a keen interest in history, and was curious about art. While I’ve been lucky enough to travel and see some interesting places... [Red Notice] really opened my eyes to the world’s greatest museums, and the art they hold.” So there’s tech, art, and action at every turn — as Agent Hartley teams up with art thief Nolan Booth (Ryan Reynolds) to bring down his rival, The Bishop (Gadot). Throw in some rudely-interrupted car chases, moped getaways and a narrow shave with a yacht, and you get a film that doesn’t claim to be intellectual, but is great fun.  Netflix x action  Netflix has a penchant for big, bold action movies. Think 2019’s 6 Underground , also starring Reynolds. The Michael Bay film had a $150 million budget. Or last year’s Extraction, directed by Sam Hargrave, at $65 million. On a set visit of the Chris Hemsworth-starrer, I had a front-row seat to just how large scale these productions can get. The crew had recreated the bylanes of Bangladesh on the outskirts of Bangkok, and even imported bags of garbage from Kolkata to make the litter on the streets look authentic! Netflix acquired the distribution rights for Red Notice in 2019. Much of the film was shot before the pandemic lockdowns (shooting started in January 2020) across Atlanta, Rome and Sardinia, with an initial budget of $160 million. By the end, it was closer to $200 million, making it the most expensive Netflix movie ever. At the film’s press conference, Johnson makes a reference to the 1,000+ crew. So one can just imagine the sheer size.  There’s something about DJ  While Johnson, DJ to friends and fans, is quite capable of carrying a movie on his own, he also excels in ensemble casts. In his 43-plus film career, Pain & Gain , the Jumanji movies, as well as the Hobbs & Shaw spin-off come to mind, as does his rapport with his co-stars, from Emily Blunt to Liam Hemsworth. While he and Gadot have acted in the Fast and Furious franchise, this is his first with Reynolds. “I’ve known Gal for 10 years, and Ryan for 20,” he says. “The chemistry we share comes with experience and time, and with trust.” And with ‘keeping it real’ off screen. On November 5, he captioned a red carpet Instagram post from the premiere: “Two of the biggest movie stars in the world. And a guy who’s famous for wearing a fanny pack.” He’s referring, of course, to the iconic image of him wearing a black turtleneck with jeans and a belt bag that he just can’t outrun. The bankable star — whose fans cut across all ages — has been nominated for multiple People’s Choice Awards for Jungle Cruise and Young Rock. There’s even talk about him running for president of the United States; 46% of Americans polled last month stated they would support his candidacy. Perhaps it’s the family-friendly films like Tooth Fairy and Moana that make him relatable, or it’s his take-charge attitude in disaster movies like Rampage and San Andreas. Perhaps it’s because he’s such a rock! “I don’t think our Founding Fathers ever envisioned a six-four, bald, tattooed, half-Black, half-Samoan, tequila drinking, pickup truck driving, fanny pack-wearing guy joining their club — but if it ever happens it’d be my honor to serve you, the people,” he’d said back in February. Then last month, he admitted on Instagram, “I’m humbled... but at the end of the day, I don’t know the first thing about politics. I may have some leadership qualities but that doesn’t necessarily make me a great presidential candidate. And that’s where I am today.” For now, there’s enough DJ to keep us going this weekend — a double bill of Red Notice and Jungle Cruise (both premiered online yesterday), the former on Netflix and the Emily Blunt-starrer on Disney+Hotstar.

13 November 2021||November 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Raw Mango: talking in threes||“If you had to make a love potion, what would it smell like?” Garg has laughingly accused me of pushing him with my questions in all our interactions, so I push my luck a little bit more. Fragrances are one of the biggest tells of a person. And I’m sniffing for a story. He takes the bait. “Something mysterious and smokey, like ash. But also orange blossoms, freshly-cut grass and water.” Nothing about roses! Garg is very specific, knowledgeable, perhaps India’s biggest boundary-pushing designer, and highly opinionated. He’s previously confessed that if he didn’t have a textile and fashion brand, he would be an activist. For the last couple of seasons, he has been letting his campaigns speak his mind. After ‘Other’ — his SS21 offering that featured models in hyper-real, painted faces in surreal locations with spooky music (that got the online troll army working extra hours) — I wonder if he’s trying to soften the mood with this romantic take. Actually, scratch that.  Something about Shimla  Romantics’ campaign was launched as a five-part video series, shot by photographer Ashish Shah at Shimla’s Chapslee hotel, former summer residence of the late Raja Charanjit Singh of Kapurthala. It’s not just a pretty location. Kapurthalas were Indian royals, but known to be influenced by European culture, mixing Indian and western aesthetics — Garg’s manifesto for this line. The muse? Beloved Hungarian-Indian painter Amrita Sher-Gil who spent a large amount of time in Shimla, and was famous for both her realistic portraits and her love life. Sher-Gil was openly bisexual. Romantics’ imagery features three models: two girls and a man living out their best throuple life in a Rococo-inspired cottage. Garg says he doesn’t think of them (who he has named Madhavi, Jamshed and Ruth in his head) as a modern couple. “They are just young people exploring their sexuality and different facets of love.” The videos are shorts, but tell a whole story about a time in the three people’s lives in a signature Raw Mango nostalgia palette. “Sometimes love is just someone understanding you like no one else has. And sometimes it’s how the light falls,” he shares. The first short starts out innocently with Jamshed enjoying a slow day of reading. By the fifth one, we are at one of Indian fashion’s first campaigns suggesting the possibility of a threesome.  Eyes of the beholder  ‘Will you ever design a full ‘western wear’ prêt collection?’ Ever the contrarian, Garg corrects me. “There is no such thing as Indian or western silhouettes. It’s all a big blur now. India has always been a drape country. Pyjamas and chu r idars are outside influences, too. Blouse is not an Indian word.” Romantics features saris, corset-inspired blouses, lehengas , and maxis in sheer organza accented with pearl and bead work. The European Rococo movement focussed on the most exquisite brocade from Italy and France; a textile that has now become synonymous with India, and that Garg has dedicated his brand to. The ‘Varanasi brocade’ in Romantics features woven bows, delicate flora and fauna. The jewellery is from Hanut Singh, grandson of the Kapurthala lineage. It all comes together seamlessly, with meaning. His usual lemons, neons and jewel tones don’t find space — it’s pared down to black, ivory, blush, mint green and powder blues, which he refers to as aasmani (of the sky). Some of his more contemporary silhouettes in stiff brocade are also a new playing field, a dare even. Rococo, known as the age of Enlightenment, birthed new ideas about existence and living, and carried within it the human spirit’s need for optimism and perhaps even frivolity. Garg has often reminded me that many Indias exist within this country, and with Romantics he’s talking about an India (and mind) that was free, before it forgot.From Rs. 45,000, at Raw Mango stores.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/raw-mango-talking-in-threes/article37467367.ece
13 November 2021||Pune,||Maharashtra transport stir impasse continues||The impasse over the Maharashtra transport workers strike continued on Friday as all 250 bus depots of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) remained shut for the fourth consecutive day, inconveniencing lakhs of commuters across the State. Chief among the agitators’ demand was an immediate merger of the cash-strapped MSRTC with the State Government as the amalgamation would accord the status of State Government employees to MSRTC workers. The State Government had suspended more than 2,000 MSRTC workers for continuing to agitate even after the Bombay High Court declared the strike “invalid”. According to MSRTC authorities, some of the workers had resumed work after State Transport Minister Anil Parab had assured full protection to the employees who were willing to rejoin duty. Mr. Parab singled out BJP leader Gopichand Padalkar and BJP ally Sadabhau Khot, who heads the Rayat Kranti Sanghatana, for continuing to incite the MSRTC workers against the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi Government. “Stern action will be taken against those attempting to obstruct MSRTC workers from resuming duties. I urge them [the MSRTC delegation] to present their demands pertaining to the merger with the State Government before the high-level committee, which will submit its findings within 12 weeks. After the committee submits the report to the High Court, the court’s decision will be binding equally on the Government as wells as the MSRTC workers,” the Minister said. He again appealed to the agitating MSRTC not to fall prey to leaders of political parties claiming to support their strike. “Such parties [BJP] do not give a fig leaf about the well-being of the MSRTC workers… I urge them to resume duties as they are incurring heavy losses with every passing day and are liable to face action if they continue to strike in this manner,” Mr. Parab said. ‘Sinister intent’ Meanwhile, the Raj Thackeray-led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) accused the Government of “not being disposed” to break the stalemate and having a sinister intent of letting the strike continue with the aim of finishing off the MSRTC. “The MNS’ stance on this agitation is very clear… We have already taken out a declaration stating that we are firmly behind the MSRTC workers. While we thought the ruling Government would take steps to resolve the crisis, it now appears that the Government has no intention of doing so,” said MNS leader Sandeep Deshpande. He said the Government was planning to sell off MSRTC to private players, adding that its deliberate inaction in resolving the crisis was proof of its intent. MSRTC workers continued their protest at Azad Maidan in south Mumbai as well as in different parts of the State, including Nashik, Pune and the Marathwada region. The transport corporation on Wednesday had filed a contempt petition in the Bombay High Court on the grounds that the unions had continued the strike despite the court declaring it illegal. The court has sought an answer from the unions and will hear the matter on November 15.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/maharashtra-transport-stir-impasse-continues/article37467310.ece
13 November 2021||Lucknow,||U.P. ex-Minister, 2 others get life term||A special court here on Friday awarded former Uttar Pradesh Minister Gayatri Prajapati and two others life imprisonment for raping a woman. The court also imposed a fine of Rs. 2 lakh on each convict. Prajapati and two others — Ashok Tiwari and Ashish Shukla — were present in the court when it pronounced the judgment. Judge P.K. Rai had on Wednesday held Prajapati, a key figure in the Akhilesh Yadav government, and his accomplices guilty of raping the woman and also trying to rape her minor daughter. It said the prosecution has been able to prove charges against them beyond a reasonable doubt. However, the court acquitted four others — Vikas Verma, Roopeshwar, Amrendra Singh, alias Pintu, and Chandrapal — due to lack of evidence. The prosecution had produced 17 witnesses in the case. The court also directed the Lucknow Police Commissioner to ascertain the circumstances under which the woman and two other witnesses had changed their statements during the trial. Prajapati was arrested in March 2017. The FIR against him was registered at the Gautampalli police station here on the directions of the Supreme Court, which gave its order on the woman’s plea against the police inaction over her complaint. Prajapati has been in jail since the registration of the FIR. The woman had claimed that Prajapati and his accomplices had been raping her since October 2014 and she decided to lodge a complaint after they tried to molest and rape her minor daughter in July 2016.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/up-ex-minister-2-others-get-life-term/article37467314.ece
13 November 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Hooda criticises Kangana’s comments||The Leader of the Opposition in the Haryana Assembly Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Friday criticised the statement made by Padma Shri awardee and film actor Kangana Ranaut recently on India’s independence. “No one can be allowed to insult the freedom struggle and freedom fighters of the country,” Mr. Hooda said. Ms. Ranaut had said that “India attained freedom in 2014”, and what it got in 1947 was “alms”. Mr. Hooda demanded that the Padma award given to the actress, who had “humiliated the sacrifice of our great freedom fighters during the freedom struggle”, should be withdrawn. “Our country got freedom after years of struggle and countless sacrifices. Those who think that the country has got freedom as bheekh (alms), have probably never even read about the freedom movement,” Mr. Hooda said. “Countless freedom fighters fought for the country’s independence. Some of these great women and men even sacrificed their lives for the freedom of the country. It is due to their sacrifices and lifelong struggles that we are a free country today,” he added. Mr. Hooda said he himself belonged to a freedom fighter’s family. “My late father, Chaudhary Ranbir Singh Hooda, suffered atrocities by the British during the freedom struggle and spent many years in various jails. The sacrifices of thousands of such great freedom fighters forced the British to leave India and flee,” he said. ‘Read and understand’ Mr. Hooda said the generation that did not have to struggle for freedom, which did not see the era of slavery and which was born in a free India, should never forget the freedom struggle and the sacrifices made by freedom fighters. “People of this generation should read, understand and know more about our freedom fighters so that they too are inspired by the patriotism, tenacity and sacrifice of our freedom fighters,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hooda-criticises-kanganas-comments/article37467308.ece
13 November 2021||Mumbai,||High Court reserves order on plea by Wankhede’s father against Minister||The Bombay High Court on Friday reserved its order in a defamation suit filed by Narcotics Control Bureau’s zonal director Sameer Wankhede’s father against Maharashtra Cabinet Minister Nawab Malik. A vacation bench of Justice Madhav Jadhav heard the matter for the whole day. Dhyandeo Wankhede has sought Rs. 1.25 crore in damages from Mr. Malik for making defamatory statements. The plea mentions Mr. Malik posting a purported birth certificate of his son on Twitter suggesting that he is a Muslim. The suit mentions that every day something or the other is put out by Mr. Malik on Twitter, and on Friday it was about his son’s sister-in-law. Mr. Wankhede is seeking an injunction from the court to direct Mr. Malik to not post any defamatory or derogatory statements on social media against his family. Mr. Wankhede filed an affidavit with 28 documents to show that his name was Dhyandeo, not Dawood as alleged by the Nationalist Congress Party leader. ‘Apps can alter images’ Referring to photos and Whatsapp chats, advocate Arshad Shaikh, appearing for Mr. Wankhede, told the court that there were apps available on Playstore that could alter images and chats. A perception was being created that Mr. Wankhede was an extortionist and because of this the family was being attacked. Social media accounts Senior advocate Atul Damle, representing Mr. Malik, told the court that the documents he relied upon were taken from public websites and whatever had been reposted were taken from social media accounts. “In the suit and in the additional affidavit, Mr. Wankhede has categorically stated that he does not have the original birth certificate or the photocopy,” he said. Mr. Malik said in his affidavit that he had sufficient evidence to prove the allegations against Sameer Wankhede.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/high-court-reserves-order-on-plea-by-wankhedes-father-against-minister/article37467305.ece

Earlier in the day, Aryan visited the Narcotics Control Bureau’s south Mumbai office for marking weekly attendance, as instructed by the Bombay High Court while granting him bail last month. Later he appeared before the SIT headed by NCB Deputy Director General Sanjay Kumar Singh in neighbouring Navi Mumbai, sources said. The SIT is probing at least six cases including the drugs-on-cruise case. The NCB had raided a cruise ship off the Mumbai coast on October 2 and claimed to have seized drugs. Aryan and several others were held during the raid. The team arrived here from Delhi last week and has recorded statements of some important witnesses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ncbs-sit-quizzes-aryan-khan/article37467304.ece
13 November 2021||Kolkata,||Kolkata Book Fair to return in Jan. 2022||Life in the City of Joy largely revolves around two events: Durga Puja, which marks the onset of autumn, and the ‘boi mela’ or book fair, held towards the end of the winter, when people pour out of their homes for a date with the printed word. While Kolkata didn’t miss out on Durga Puja in spite of the pandemic, though the scale of celebrations was nowhere close to what it used to be during pre-COVID days, it didn’t have the book fair that should have been held in January 2021. Now, after a gap of two years, it is set to be inaugurated on January 31, 2022, and will go on till February 13, the venue being the usual Central Park in Salt Lake City. “We owe it to the small publishers and to the public. The publishers are on the verge of starvation because there has been no book fair in the past two years.” Tridib Kumar Chatterjee, honorary general secretary of the Publishers’ & Booksellers’ Guild, which organises the Kolkata Book Fair, told The Hindu . “Not all books are available online and not everybody is capable of ordering books online. A large chunk of the local population depends on the book fair,” he said. 45th edition This will be the 45th edition of the book fair, and each year a foreign country serves as its theme. Bangladesh was to be the theme for the January 2021 fair, considering the country was celebrating 50 years of its liberation. Since the event was cancelled, it will remain the theme for the 2022 fair. “The 75th year of Indian Independence, the 125th birth year of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, and the birth centenary of Satyajit Ray will also be celebrated at the International Kolkata Book Fair 2022,” Mr. Chatterjee said. “Many eminent personalities passed on in the recent past, including Soumitra Chatterjee, Pranab Mukherjee, Sankha Ghosh, Buddhadeb Dasgupta, Buddhadeb Guha and Subrata Mukherjee. We will also pay homage to them.” The Kolkata Book Fair is considered the largest attended book fair in the world, where disparate political ideologies, from right-wing organisations to numerous Leftist outfits, get an opportunity to sell their literature. In 2020, the fair recorded a footfall of 2.2 million and saw a direct sale, from business to customer, of Rs. 24 crore. Since 2014, it has also been hosting a three-day Kolkata Literature Festival, which will be held in 2022 as well. COVID norms The organisers plan to enforce COVID-appropriate behaviour at the venue: visitors should be double-vaccinated, wear masks and follow social distancing. “The stalls would be kept as airy as possible. The sizes of the stalls might also be reduced. Emphasis will be on proper sanitisation,” Mr. Chatterjee said. Year 2021 was not the first time the event was called off. In 2008 too, after a last-minute court order following a PIL that the fair was causing harm to the environment, the event could not be held. At the time it was being held at the Park Circus Maidan. The fair then shifted to the Science City grounds, where it continued to be held for a few years before finding itself a permanent, and a more suitable venue in Salt Lake City.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/kolkata-book-fair-to-return-in-jan-2022/article37467312.ece
13 November 2021||Pune,||Maharashtra sees slight rise in COVID cases||For the first time in nearly a month, new cases outweighed recoveries with Maharashtra reporting 997 new COVID-19 cases on Friday as against 945 new recoveries. The slight rise has now taken the active case tally to 12,290. Maharashtra also reported its highest fatality surge in more than a fortnight, with 41 deaths taking the cumulative death toll to 1,40,516. The case fatality rate remains constant at 2.12%. The total cases now stand at 66,22,345 while the State’s cumulative recoveries have risen to 64,65,893 with the recovery rate at 97.64%. “Of a total 6,37,47,431 laboratory samples tested thus far, 66,22,345 (with the average case positivity falling to 10.39%) have returned positive, with over 1.17 lakh samples being tested in the last 24 hours,” said Dr. Pradeep Awate, State Surveillance Officer. ‘Increase testing’ The Maharashtra State COVID-19 task force has directed the government to ramp the pace of sample testing, which had severely fallen during the week of Deepavali festivities. The low COVID-19 case surges in the past few days have been attributed to the low number of samples being tested, which has come down to an average 85-90,000 from the erstwhile daily average of 1.8 lakh-2 lakh samples. Pune reported more than 220 new cases and 13 deaths, taking its total cases to 11,57,232 and its total death toll to 19,130. According to the district authorities, the active case tally has fallen to a little over 2,100. Mumbai reported 257 new cases — a reduction from the 300-plus daily cases of the past few days — taking its total case tally to 7,59,819 while the active count stood at 3,665. A single death took the city’s death count to 16,288. Satara reported just 18 new cases and three deaths, taking the total cases to 2,50,723, of which just 197 are active, while the death toll stands at 6,456. Ahmednagar reported 54 cases and two deaths, taking its total case tally to 3,40,574. The active cases have dropped sharply to 1,358. The cumulative death toll stands at 7,082.
