29 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||Omicron risk: Centre tightens rules for overseas travellers||The Union Health Ministry on Sunday revised guidelines mandating that all international passengers entering India have to submit 14-day travel details and upload a negative RT-PCR test report on the Air Suvidha portal before the journey. The new guidelines will come into effect from December 1. The RT-PCR report to be uploaded should have been conducted within 72 hours prior to the journey. Travellers from “countries at-risk”, including the U.K., South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel, will need to take the COVID test post-arrival and wait for results at the airport, according to the guidelines. If tested negative, they have to undergo home quarantine for seven days followed by a re-test on the eighth day. “On arrival, the passengers found to be symptomatic during screening shall be immediately isolated and taken to medical facility as per health protocol. If tested positive, their contacts shall be identified and managed as per laid down protocol,” said the updated guidelines. Travellers from countries not considered ‘at risk’ will be allowed to leave the airport and must self-monitor their health for 14 days post arrival. A sub-section (5% of the total flight passengers) will be required to undergo post-arrival testing at random at the airport. The guidelines have also stated that children under five years of age are exempted from pre- and post-arrival testing. However, if found symptomatic on arrival or during home quarantine, they shall undergo testing and treated as per protocol.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/omicron-risk-centre-tightens-rules-for-overseas-travellers/article37744697.ece
29 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||In-flight WiFi hits a dead zone in India||Three years after the Department of Telecom permitted WiFi services on commercial flights, it is yet to become a reality for domestic air travellers as airlines grapple with the huge installation costs and the impact of COVID-19 on passenger demand. Domestic carriers have been slow in offering the service because retrofitting aircraft with the required antenna is an expensive affair that takes nearly 12 hours. Airlines find it difficult to pass on the costs to the passengers in an extremely competitive market for the cheapest ticket. However, international airlines such as Lufthansa, Air France and Emirates have started offering the service, though earlier they were switching it off on entering India skies. “The equipment costs Rs. 3 crore to Rs. 4 crore for one aircraft, which is the entry barrier because it is difficult to recover the cost from passengers. As customers start expecting this service and airlines increasingly treat it as an amenity instead of a value-added service, in-flight connectivity will evolve and mature,” says Shivaji Chatterjee, senior vice-president, enterprise business, Hughes Communications India Private Ltd. Those airlines that have started to offer the service are rolling it out only on new aircraft that come equipped with the antenna. Full-service carrier Vistara is the only Indian airline to offer it since September 2020. But the airline with a fleet of 50 offers the service only on four Airbus A321 Neo and two Boeing 787-9 jets that are used for international flights as these are new aircraft that come fitted with the equipment. The service is available free of cost for all passengers till December 7 and users can send messages, e-mails and surf the Net. “Streaming through platforms like Netflix is not offered. Moreover, we switch off the Internet if we use these planes on domestic routes,” according to the airline’s spokesperson. The airline also doesn’t allow any form of voice or video calls through WiFi Internet connectivity to ensure there is no discomfort to other passengers. Back in October 2018, while taking the delivery of its first Boeing 737 MAX 8 that also come fitted with an antenna and other paraphernalia, low-cost airline SpiceJet said it would be the first airline to offer passengers internet services.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/in-flight-wifi-hits-a-dead-zone-in-india/article37744699.ece
29 November 2021||New Delhi,||Govt. lists farm law repeal on today’s House agenda||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday skipped the customary all-party meeting convened by Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi, a day before the start of the winter session of Parliament that will take up the repeal of the three farm laws. The Government listed the Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021, in the Lok Sabha’s list of business for Monday, but no time for debate has been allotted as yet since the Business Advisory Committee will meet only on Monday morning. In the explanatory note to the repeal Bill, the Government justified the farm laws, and said only “a group of farmers” were protesting, but added, “As we celebrate the 75th Year of Independence the need of the hour is to take everyone together on the path of inclusive growth and development.” Earlier in the day, at the Government’s all-party meet, Opposition leaders raised a host of issues issues, including a new law to guarantee the minimum support price (MSP), discussion on price rise, unemployment and the Pegasus snooping controversy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-lists-farm-law-repeal-on-todays-house-agenda/article37744701.ece
29 November 2021||Vijayawada,||YSRCPP suggests JPC on MSP for crops||While welcoming the repeal of the three controversial farm laws, the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) requested the Central government in the all-party meeting held in New Delhi on the eve of the commencement of the winter session of Parliament on Monday (November 29), to constitute a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to sort out the issues related to the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for various crops and make a legislation that guarantees MSP to farmers after consulting all the stakeholders in the first place. The YSRC Parliamentary Party also sought provision of MSP for marine products and poultry to help the huge number of distressed farmers in overcoming the crisis, as advised earlier by Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy. Addressing media after the meeting, Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy said the Centre had stipulated MSP for 23 crops only whereas the A.P. government was giving MSP to 24 commodities in addition to those crops. Accordingly, MSP should be fixed and the same given legislative backing to ensure accountability. The fact that only 2.65 crore people in A.P. were covered by the National Food Security Act was taken to the notice of Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal who represented the Centre in the all-party meeting, with an appeal to take steps on the basis of revised census.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ysrcpp-suggests-jpc-on-msp-for-crops/article37744707.ece

The Ministry has written to the State Governments stating that in the absence of sufficient testing, it is extremely difficult to determine the infection spread. “States must strengthen the testing infrastructure,” he said.

29 November 2021||Bengaluru,||Bengaluru show nixed, Faruqui hints at quitting||Stand-up comedian Munawar Faruqui on Sunday hinted that he may not do any more shows, a day after his scheduled event in Bengaluru was cancelled. Citing possible law and order problems, the Bengaluru City Police on Saturday night “advised” the organisers to call off the indoor event, ‘Dongri to Nowhere’, scheduled for Sunday evening. Mr. Faruqui left Bengaluru on Sunday morning after posting a statement on his social media handles where he hinted that he was quitting the space. Several of his shows have been cancelled in a similar manner in other cities. Lamenting that he was jailed for a joke he did not tell, he wrote: “I think this is the end. My name is Munawar Faruqui and that’s been my time, you guys were a wonderful audience. Goodbye! I am done.” In a letter to the organisers on Saturday night, police said several groups were opposed to Mr. Faruqui’s show and this “could create chaos and could disturb the public peace and harmony, which may further lead to law and order problems”. The stand-up comic was arrested in Indore in January 2021 after a Hindutva right wing activist alleged he denigrated Hindu gods. He spent 37 days in jail before the Supreme Court granted him bail. Over the last two months, 12 of his shows were cancelled by police in Maharashtra, Goa and Gujarat following a campaign reportedly orchestrated by Hindutva right wing organisations calling for a ban on him and threatening protests if his shows are held. The action of Bengaluru city police has come under severe criticism.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bengaluru-show-nixed-faruqui-hints-at-quitting/article37744708.ece

29 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||India has turned into a nation of job creators, not seekers: PM||The turning point in India’s growth story is that it has become a nation of job creators rather than job seekers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday, hailing a recent surge in start-ups valued over a billion dollars. Addressing the nation through his monthly Mann Ki Baat radio programme, Mr. Modi also reminded listeners that the pandemic is still ongoing and urged them to maintain safety protocols. “Never forget that coronavirus is not gone yet. It is the responsibility of us all to continue to take necessary precautions,” he said, a day after chairing a review of the situation, public health preparedness and the status of vaccinations.  Matter of pride During his address, Mr. Modi noted that till 2015, the country had only nine or 10 unicorns, the name given to start-ups whose valuation has crossed a billion dollars. “You will be very happy to know that India is now flying high even in the world of unicorns. According to a report, a big change has come this year. In just 10 months, a unicorn is being raised in India every 10 days. This is also a big thing because our youth have achieved this success in the midst of the pandemic. Today there are more than 70 unicorns in India,” he said. Solving global problems Adding that Indian youth start-ups were solving global problems, Mr. Modi interacted with a young man named Mayur Patil who had developed air filter technology to reduce emissions while improving mileage in vehicles. After installing it in 10 buses of the regional transport corporation in 2017-18, they found that fuel efficiency had increased 10%, while emissions were reduced by 40%. The patent was granted this year, and when Mayur and three of his friends participated in NITI Aayog’s Atal New India Challenge, they received a Rs. 90-lakh grant which enabled them to start a factory to mass produce the air filters. The PM offered Mr. Patil’s experience as an example of a societal mindset change in favour of entrepreneurs. “This is the turning point of India’s growth story, where people are now not only dreaming of becoming job seekers but also becoming job creators. This will further strengthen India’s stature on the global stage.” The PM also hailed community efforts to safeguard the environment, from river rejuvenation to support farmers in Uttar Pradesh’s Jalaun to palmyra planting in Tamil Nadu’s Thoothukudi to prevent soil erosion and the submersion of coastal islands during cyclones. “Nature poses a threat to us only when we disturb her balance or destroy her sanctity,” said Mr. Modi. Mr. Modi also interacted with beneficiaries of the Ayushmaan Bharat scheme, who had received free medical treatment. Looking ahead to December, the Prime Minister noted that the month will mark the golden jubilee of the 1971 war and the annual celebration of Navy Day and Armed Forces Flag Day. Noting that the nation will commemorate the death anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar on December 6, the Prime Minister said the basic spirit of the Constitution expected all citizens to discharge their duties and urged the citizens to take a pledge to fulfil duties as an apt tribute to the drafter of the Constitution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-has-turned-into-a-nation-of-job-creators-says-modi/article37744495.ece
29 November 2021||New Delhi,||Trinamool to skip Opposition meeting||Ahead of the winter session of Parliament that gets under way on November 29, cracks in the Opposition are already visible as the Trinamool Congress is likely to skip the floor coordination meeting on Monday, convened by Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar too called Mr. Kharge to inform him of his inability because of a wedding in Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut’s family. Mr. Kharge, however, played down the divisions within the Opposition ranks. He said the Trinamool leaders would be busy with the party’s working committee meet on Monday. “We will try to take everyone along and remain united on issues affecting the people,” Mr. Kharge told presspersons on Sunday. The Congress had managed to persuade around 15 Opposition parties on November 26 to skip the Constitution Day celebrations in the Central Hall of Parliament to “protest against the undermining of the Constitution under the Narendra Modi Government”. The Trinamool was part of the joint Opposition action but such unity may not be seen during the session. Asked to comment about the reports, the party’s leader in the Rajya Sabha, Derek O’Brien, did not specifically respond to his party giving it a miss. “Yes, there will be Opposition unity. It’s common issues that will bring about total unity in the Opposition,” he told The Hindu . “I also must point out that there is a distinction between the RJD, DMK, RJD and the CPI(M) — they are all electoral allies of the Congress. The NCP-Shiv Sena and JMM run a Government with the Congress. The Congress is not our electoral ally, nor are we running a Government with them. That’s the difference,” he said. Relations between the Trinamool and the Congress have nosedived in recent times after the former’s ambitious expansion plans in States such as Goa and the induction of 12 Congress MLAs in Meghalaya to become the principal Opposition party in the northeastern State. The Trinamool’s new-found aggression against the Congress is not only driven by election strategist Prashant Kishor to project West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee as a prime ministerial candidate for the 2024 Lok Sabha election but also a fallout of the Congress choosing to ally with the Left Front in Bengal in the crucial Assembly election earlier this year. “Indian National Congress is the principal Opposition party, the central pillar of the Opposition. We have long experience, both in governance and now for the last seven years or more in the Opposition,” Deputy Leader of the Congress in Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma said at a briefing on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/trinamool-to-skip-opposition-meet/article37744511.ece
29 November 2021||New Delhi,||Omicron puts spotlight back on safety||Omicron, which is the most mutated form of COVID-19 discovered thus far with 32 mutations to the spike protein, has scientists worried. They fear that the mutations may now allow it to evade existing vaccines and spread quickly. Doctors and experts in India said that mutations are inevitable and the only protection the general public can take recourse to is vaccination, use of masks and avoiding crowds. Saumitra Das, Director, National Institute of Biomedical Genomics and Professor, Indian Institute of Science, said, “It is too early to fully understand the extent of damage that this virus can cause. While vaccination doesn’t cut transmission, it does reduce severity and number of deaths.” Vidya P. Taneja, senior consultant, paediatrics, Aartas Clinishare, Delhi, said that the new variant, identified now as B.1.1.529, had put the spotlight back on global efforts towards controlling the disease. “This variant, first identified in Botswana, harbours a large number of mutations, including more than 30 changes to the original spike protein on which the COVID-19 vaccines were based. Many of these changes have been found in the Delta and Alpha variants too and are linked to heightened infection rates and ability to evade antibodies induced by vaccines,” she said. The doctor added that researchers the world over were closely tracking Omicron’s spread to determine its impact. “Since transmission is through the same mode, that is airborne, preventive measures are the same. We need to, therefore, reinforce that all precautions should be taken as before. The importance of going full steam ahead with our vaccination efforts cannot be emphasised enough, especially seeing the situation in Europe where most cases are occurring in the non-vaccinated. Mutations are inevitable and the way ahead remains close monitoring, surveillance, community partnership and vaccine equity,” she said. Testing at airports must be increased and every international traveller who had entered India in the last two weeks should be tested, said Vikas Maurya, director, pulmonology, Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, Delhi. “If things go out of control, then it will involve huge economic costs and overburden the healthcare system with increase in mortality as well. A few cases will not affect us greatly,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/omicron-puts-spotlight-back-on-safety/article37744523.ece
29 November 2021||LUCKNOW,||U.P. TET cancelled after paper leak, 26 arrested||The BJP-led Uttar Pradesh Government cancelled the TET (Teacher Eligibility Test) scheduled on Sunday after the police found that the question paper had been leaked. While 26 persons involved in the alleged leak have been arrested, the Opposition parties raised concern over the incident and accused the Government of corruption in such recruitments. Nearly 20 lakh candidates were appearing for the examination, said ADG law and order Prashant Kumar, announcing the cancellation of the examination at a press conference here. Mr. Kumar said the police had found photocopies of the question paper and messages on WhatsApp displaying it and the answers from some of those apprehended. “The photocopies were shared with the Government and it came to light that these questions were the ones that were in the question paper in the examination,” Mr. Kumar said. The officer, however, said the question papers had not reached the examination centres on Sunday. The Special Task Force will probe the matter. Sixteen of the accused belonged to Prayagraj, while in Shamli, three persons were arrested with 10 copies of the question paper they had purchased for Rs. 5 lakh and had taken Rs. 50,000 from 50-60 candidates to provide them access to it and help them in memorising the questions, the police said. The main accused was identified as Rajendra Patel of Pratapgarh, who, the police said, was the kingpin of the gang. Another accused Sunny Singh of Gaya in Bihar provided solvers to the gang from Bihar, the police claimed. A candidate was also arrested in Chitrakoot. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath directed officials to conduct the exam in a transparent manner within a month. The Gangsters Act would be slapped on those found involved in the leak and their properties would also be confiscated, Mr. Adityanath said at an event in east Uttar Pradesh The Government said the candidates need not fill fresh forms or pay fee again. The sudden cancellation left the candidates stranded, following which the Government provided them buses to return to their home districts without any charge. Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav said the paper leak was akin to ruining the future of 20 lakh unemployed candidates. “Paper leaks and cancellation of examination and results are common things under the BJP Government,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/up-tet-cancelled-after-paper-leak-26-arrested/article37744492.ece
29 November 2021||Pune,||Govt. must introduce MSP law: Tikait||The BJP-led Central Government must bring a law to guarantee Minimum Support Price (MSP) for crops to protect the interests of farmers in the country, Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait said on Sunday. Stating that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had advocated MSP while he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Mr. Tikait said Mr. Modi at the time had sought a nationwide law to ensure that farmers’ interests were guaranteed. However, the Centre today was deliberately skirting a debate on the issue, he said. Mr. Tikait was in Mumbai to participate in a ‘ Kisan Mahapanchayat ’ held in the city’s Azad Maidan under the umbrella of the Samyukta Shetkari Kamgar Morcha (SSKM). “The Centre should bring a law to guarantee MSP to farmers. There are several issues related to the agriculture and labour sectors that need attention and we will travel all over the country to highlight them,” said Mr. Tikait. The farmer leader further demanded that financial aid be given to the kin of farmers who died during the protests against the three agriculture laws. The Prime Minister recently announced that the laws would be repealed. Mr. Tikait, who was in Hyderabad earlier this week, had said that the onus lied on every Government in the country to come to the aid of the kin of the 750-odd farmers who lost their lives agitating against the three laws.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-must-introduce-msp-law-tikait/article37744497.ece
29 November 2021||Agartala,||BJP registers landslide win in Tripura civic elections||The ruling BJP on Sunday swept the municipal elections in Tripura, winning 217 of the 222 seats to which elections were held on November 25. The Left Front, led by the CPI(M), won three seats, while the Trinamool Congress and the Tipraha Indigenous Progressive Regional Alliance (TIPRA) won one seat each. The Congress failed to open its account. Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb led the BJP celebrations, and congratulated the people for rallying behind his party. Mr. Deb tweeted, “I consider your votes to the BJP as blessings and these blessings motivate us to work harder for the development of all 37 lakh people of the State.” He linked the results to the welfare and development initiatives of his Government. The Opposition parties, however, rejected the results, alleging that they had predicted such an outcome after the BJP reduced the elections to a “farce”. The BJP captured with ease the Agartala Municipal Corporation and 13 other civic bodies where it now has 329 of the 334 seats. The party had earlier won 112 seats uncontested. The party bagged all 51 seats in the Agartala Municipal Corporation. In the Ambassa Municipal Council in Dhalai district, the BJP bagged 12 seats, while the Trinamool, the CPI(M) and TIPRA got one seat each. The Trinamool Congress secured around 24% of votes in the Agartala Municipal Corporation elections. Elections to the Agartala Municipal Corporation and other municipal councils and nagar panchayats were held amid allegations of widespread rigging, and attacks on Opposition candidates.

29 November 2021||New Delhi,||Panel seeks more data on Covovax||An expert panel of the Central Drug Authority, which recently reviewed the Serum Institute of India’s application for emergency authorisation of the COVID-19 vaccine Covovax, has sought additional data from the firm, while noting the jab has not yet been approved in the country of origin, official sources said. The SII put in an application to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) in October for grant of market authorisation of Covovax for restricted use in emergency situations. The Pune-based firm had submitted interim safety and immunogenicity data of Phases 2 and 3 bridging clinical trials conducted in the country and interim clinical trial data of safety and efficacy from Phase 3 clinical trials conducted in the U.K. and the U.S. along with its application, official sources said. “The Subject Expert Committee (SEC) on COVID-19 of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), which deliberated on the application on November 24, noted that the vaccine is technology transfer of Novavax vaccine and is not yet approved in the country of origin,” a source said. After detailed deliberation, the committee recommended that the firm should submit additional data and information. It has sought correct status of the Phase 3 clinical trials held in the U.S. and the U.K. along with latest data on the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity, comparative statement of immunogenicity parameters of the subjects from the U.S., the U.K. and other overseas Phase 3 studies, the source said. The Government recently permitted the export of two crore doses of Covovax to Indonesia, produced in India by the SII, official sources said. The DCGI office had granted SII permission to manufacture and stock Covovax on May 17. Based on the DCGI’s approval, till now, the Pune-based firm has stockpiled doses, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/panel-seeks-more-data-on-covovax/article37744516.ece
29 November 2021||New Delhi,||Rajya Sabha leaders express annoyance at CJI’s remarks||Floor leaders of the Rajya Sabha, at a meeting with House Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu on the eve of the winter session of Parliament that begins on Monday, expressed concern over the Chief Justice of India’s recent remarks on disruptions in Parliament. Chief Justice N.V. Ramana, speaking at the 75th Independence Day function organised by the Supreme Court Bar Association, complained about a lack of debate in Parliament. He said it is a “sorry state of affairs” and that absence of quality debate leaves many aspects of the laws unclear, increasing the burden on the court. The floor leaders said it is for the Presiding Officers to take appropriate action if the norms of functioning are being violated in the legislatures, and other constitutional agencies should not comment adversely, sources said. They did not, however, name Justice Ramana. In response, Mr. Naidu said, “I can understand your concerns. But such comments should be viewed in the context of the functioning of legislatures marked by persistent disruptions, unruly behaviour and violent actions which have deleterious effects. The best way to counter them is to ensure proper functioning of the legislatures by ensuring their dignity and decorum since such comments are finding resonance with the public from what they see about the functioning of the legislatures.” Productive session A few Opposition leaders — Prasanna Acharya of the BJP, Satish Chandra Mishra of the BSP, John Brittas of the CPI(M) and Binoy Viswam of the CPI — expressed concern over the course of events during the last monsoon session. They also said a repeat of the monsoon session should be avoided. As per an analysis by the Rajya Sabha Secretariat, 70% of the functional time of the House was lost to persistent disruptions. Mr. Naidu urged the Government and the leaders of the Opposition to regularly talk to each other to enable effective functioning of the House. He appealed to all sections to cooperate in ensuring a productive winter session.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rs-leaders-express-annoyance-at-justice-ramanas-comment/article37744506.ece
29 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||India, Bangladesh to deepen ties as partners, says Goyal||The India-Bangladesh CEO Forum will meet soon for the first time, even as the two countries work towards finalising a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) to deepen trade and economic ties as partners rather than competitors, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said on Sunday. Congratulating Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on the country’s transition from a less-developed country to a developing nation status, Mr. Goyal said India stands “shoulder to shoulder” with the country’s leadership and people in their development journey. Noting that India-Bangladesh supply chains worked uninterrupted through the pandemic, Mr. Goyal said improving connectivity is “imperative” for expanding and realising the potential for bilateral trade and investments. The leaders of the two countries have brought New Delhi and Dhaka closer and can together bring economic prosperity to South Asia, he said. “Since 2014, we have scaled up our trade and economic engagement as partners and not competitors. Bangladesh is India’s biggest trade partner in South Asia with a volume of over $10 billion. We are looking to advance a CEPA with Bangladesh,” he said. India, he said, had sent over one crore COVID-19 vaccine doses to the country and has extended concessional credit lines of about $8 billion, the highest for any single country. “We are looking forward to hold the first meeting of the India-Bangladesh CEOs Forum to promote mutual investments. A bilateral textile industry forum has also been constituted to facilitate cooperation in the textile sector,” Mr. Goyal said, emphasising that over 350 Indian companies are now registered in Bangladesh. “India is also developing two Indian economic zones at Mirsarai and Mongla. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s invitation to 50 young entrepreneurs from Bangladesh will further augment our ties,” he pointed out at the Bangladesh International Investment summit. The summit’s theme Shonar Bangla, he said, truly reflects its growth story. The Minister identified five focus areas that could strengthen bilateral economic ties — technology, connectivity, entrepreneurship, health and tourism — and said “a true partnership is about encouraging and assisting each other in their responsibilities and aspirations”. “Sharing a common history gives us an opportunity to make new history together. Let us work with the spirit of friendship and brotherhood to write a new chapter of economic prosperity in South Asia,” he said in conclusion. The two countries will be celebrating December 6 as Maitri Divas, to mark 50 years of Bangladesh’s independence and its bilateral ties with India, which was the first country to recognise its independence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-bangladesh-to-deepen-ties-as-partners-says-goyal/article37744509.ece
29 November 2021||Bhubaneswar,||NGT levies Rs. 2 cr. fine on JSPL for altering course of water channel||The National Green Tribunal (NGT), Eastern Zone, has imposed a fine of Rs. 2 crore on the Jindal Steel and Power Limited (JSPL) for changing the natural course of Kurbadahali Nalla (water channel) in Odisha’s Angul district. The JSPL, which has a steel project in Angul district, is accused of filling up the original Kurdabahali Nalla with earth and constructing its industrial complex thereon at a time when it had not received sanction from the Odisha Government for diversion of the Kurdabahali Nalla through a diversion into the Parang Minor Irrigation Project. Alekha Chandra Tripathy, a resident of Cuttack, had filed a complaint that the JSPL had unauthorisedly usurped the Nandira River in Angul in connivance with the State authorities and filled it up with earth thereby completely obliterating the river. “We direct that out of the amount of Rs. 2 crore, Rs. 1.5 crore would be deposited with the State’s Forest Department and Rs. 50,00,000 would be deposited with the Odisha State Pollution Control Board [OSPCB],” the NGT ordered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ngt-levies-rs-2-cr-fine-on-jspl-for-altering-course-of-water-channel/article37744521.ece
29 November 2021||CHENNAI,||Heavy rain may shift to south Tamil Nadu today||After pummelling the north coastal areas, the heavy rain may shift to south Tamil Nadu on Monday. The intense rain may take a break from November 30 and decrease gradually. The cyclonic circulation over the Comorin area and the adjoining Sri Lanka coast in the lower level may move and emerge in the Arabian Sea by Monday. Officials of the India Meteorological Department said that while the easterlies over the coastal areas would push moisture into the land, the moving weather system would bring in south-westerly winds. Some parts of south coastal Tami Nadu, such as Kanniyakumari, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi and Ramanathapuram, are likely to receive heavy to very heavy rain on Monday, owing to the wind convergence. Most other parts of the coastal region, including Chennai, may receive moderate rain. On Sunday, rain lashed several coastal districts.

The guidelines have also stated that children under five years of age are exempted from pre- and post-arrival testing. However, if found symptomatic for COVID-19 on arrival or during home quarantine, they shall undergo testing and treated as per laid-down protocol.

Also, all the community contacts of those travellers who have tested positive (during home quarantine period) would be subjected to quarantine for 14 days and tested as per Government protocol. Earlier the Central Government in a release issued following a meeting chaired by Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla, said it will review “the decision on effective date of resumption of scheduled commercial international passengers service as per evolving global scenario while keeping a closer watch on emerging pandemic situation within the whole country.” Though the Government had earlier decided to resume international flights to all countries from December 15, a meeting held by the Prime Minister on Saturday decided to review the date following the emergence of the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus in a few countries. The meeting on Sunday, held to review the global situation in the wake of the emergence of the variant, was attended by V.K.

Full-service carrier Vistara is the only Indian airline to offer it since September 2020. But the airline with a fleet of 50 offers the service only on four Airbus A321 Neo and two Boeing 787-9 jets that are used for international flights as these are new aircraft that come fitted with the equipment. The service is available free of cost for all passengers till December 7 and users can send messages, e-mails and surf the Net. “Streaming through platforms like Netflix is not offered. Moreover, we switch off the Internet if we use these planes on domestic routes,” according to the airline’s spokesperson. The airline also doesn’t allow any form of voice or video calls through WiFi Internet connectivity to ensure there is no discomfort to other passengers. Back in October 2018, while taking the delivery of its first Boeing 737 MAX 8 that also come fitted with an antenna and other paraphernalia, low-cost airline SpiceJet said it would be the first airline to offer passengers internet services. Five months later, the aircraft were grounded globally following two crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia that killed over 300 people. The airline’s chairman and managing director Ajay Singh told reporters at an event held to celebrate the resumption of Boeing 737 MAX 8 flights last week that it now plans to offer WiFi services on its aircraft from January 2022. “Passengers will be able to receive WhatsApp messages, check mails, but we will disable audio because we don’t want to allow calls as they cause inconvenience to other passengers,” Mr. Singh said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-flight-wifi-hits-a-dead-zone-in-india/article37744488.ece
29 November 2021||AHMEDABAD,||Cooperative model best suited for India, says Shah||Union Home and Cooperation Minister Amit Shah on Sunday described the cooperative model as the best suited model to achieve an all-encompassing and inclusive development in a huge country like India with a population of 130 crore. Mr. Shah said the cooperative model had the capacity to bring prosperity for all and there was a need to increase the number of successful cooperative models like the Amul dairy cooperatives and bring them under one umbrella. He said this while inaugurating a milk powder factory, a poly film manufacturing plant and other projects of the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) set up with an investment of Rs. 415 crore at Gandhinagar; the Union Minister’s parliamentary constituency. Many pundits failed to figure out which economic model would fit the requirements of this country after Independence, he said and credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi with recognising the Amul model as the best suited for economic development in villages. “Seventy-five years after the country saw many governments, the country’s Prime Minister tested the model and realised as the then Chief Minister of Gujarat, that if there is any economic model for an all-encompassing, all-inclusive economic development of a country of 130 crore population, then that is only the cooperative.” Mr. Shah asked the management of Amul to work out a similar model for organic farming to encourage more farmers to adopt the practice, as overuse of fertilizers were causing soil degradation and diseases like cancer. Amul should ask its farmers to adopt organic farm practices and promised support from the Centre, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cooperative-model-best-suited-for-india-says-shah/article37744490.ece

In a statement to mark the completion of his two years in office, Mr. Thackeray, who is recuperating after a spine surgery, thanked the people for supporting his Government in all its endeavours and said it was a true “people’s Government”.

He further claimed that his three-party Government had worked hard in increasing industrial investment, generating more employment and enhancing the State’s agriculture infrastructure while focusing on ensuring better water supply and improving sanitation facilities.

The stand-up comedian was arrested in Indore in January 2021 after a Hindutva right wing activist alleged he had denigrated Hindu gods. He spent 37 days in jail before the Supreme Court granted him bail. Over the last two months, 12 of his shows have been cancelled by the police in Maharashtra, Goa and Gujarat following protest campaigns reportedly orchestrated by Hindutva right wing organisations. The action of the police has come under severe criticism. Former Amnesty India head, Aakar Patel tweeted: “What is happening to Munawar Faruqui shows how empty the fundamental rights panel is: right to equality, against discrimination, freedom of occupation and of life and personal liberty. none applicable to him.” Congress MP Shashi Tharoor called it deplorable on Twitter. In Bengaluru, the Hindu Janjagruti Samiti, an organisation whose allegedly erstwhile members have been charged with the murder of editor-activist Gauri Lankesh and scholar M.M. Kalburgi, had petitioned Police Commissioner Kamal Pant on Saturday, tweeting out the letter tagging Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, Home Minister Araga Jnanendra, Bengaluru South MP Tejaswi Surya, Uttara Kannada MP Anantkumar Hegde among others.

This was not the first such foray for the Mamata Banerjee-led party in the northeastern State. The Trinamool had its first lawmaker from Meghalaya in 2004. Former Lok Sabha Speaker Purno Agitok Sangma won the Tura constituency that year after quitting the Nationalist Congress Party and joining the Trinamool. The man he defeated was Mukul M. Sangma, a former Congress heavyweight and now the president of the Trinamool’s Meghalaya unit. But he fell out with Ms. Banerjee and quit the Trinamool a year later. The Trinamool Congress is now the principal Opposition party in Meghalaya, and its main rival is the National People’s Party (NPP) that the late P.A. Sangma founded. His son, Conrad K. Sangma, is the Chief Minister heading a coalition Government with the BJP. Mr. Mukul Sangma, who left for Kolkata on Sunday to meet Ms. Banerjee, debunked theories that the Trinamool was too Bengal or Bengali-centric to be accepted in Meghalaya. “Our supporters and friends in Meghalaya have said we made a good move, as the Trinamool is the only party that can rival the BJP.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/trinamools-meghalaya-mission-began-in-2004/article37744502.ece
29 November 2021||NEW DELHI,||4 panels formed to look into EPFO functioning||The Union Government has formed four ad-hoc board-level committees to look into the functioning of different aspects of the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), including IT, communications and pension. Union Labour and Employment Minister Bhupendra Yadav, who chairs the Central Board of Trustees of the EPFO that manages about Rs. 15 lakh crore of retirement savings, approved the formation of these panels. All the committees, notified on November 27, have been granted a tenure of three months. Labour Secretary Sunil Barthwal has been tasked with steering two of the committees — on ‘pension reforms’ and ‘IT and Communications’. Mr. Barthwal was in charge of the EPFO as the Central PF Commissioner (CPFC) till late September. As per its terms of reference, the eight-member panel on pension reforms had been told to submit a report advising ‘on matters relating to pension reforms for universalisation of social security’. An EPFO official pointed out that the mandate of this particular panel is ‘unusual and unclear’ as a board-level committee already exists for reviewing and improving the Employees’ Pension Scheme (EPS) of 1995. The ad-hoc committee on IT and Communications has 10 members, including three representatives each from employers and employee unions. The panel has been asked to suggest ‘IT measures to improve service delivery’ for EPFO members, build capacity of EPFO’s IT personnel and ‘effective media and communication with stakeholders’. Minister of State for Labour and Employment Rameswar Teli has been appointed as chair of the two other committees. One of them pertains to EPFO’s internal human resources and establishment matters while the other is tasked with finding ways to enhance EPFO’s coverage and reducing related litigation. The proceedings of the human resources committee will also be closely watched after the hasty appointments and transfers for almost 120 senior officials in July.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-forms-four-panels-to-look-into-epfo-functioning/article37744507.ece

29 November 2021||Aruppukottai,TAMIL NADU||Constable arrested for robbery||A head constable, Elangumaran, attached to the Aruppukottai Town police station, was arrested on Saturday on charges of masterminding a robbery at the house of a retired Block Development Officer, Ganesan, in October. The police said that along with Elangumaran, his elder brother, Sampath Kumar (50) and five others have been arrested and Rs. 88,000 in cash and over two sovereigns of gold were recovered from them. A knife and a car used in the robbery have also been seized from the accused. Four persons barged into the house of Ganesan (80), who was living alone at a house in Lakshmi Nagar, which comes under the Aruppukottai Taluk police station limits, on October 26. The accused threatened him with dire consequences and robbed Rs. 4 lakh and five sovereigns of gold. District Superintendent of Police, M. Manohar, formed two special teams to nab the accused. On Friday, a special team of police, led by Kariyapatti Sub-Inspector of Police, P. Ashok Kumar, intercepted a car and the inmates gave contradictory statements when they were questioned. During further interrogation, the accused spilled the beans about the broad daylight robbery. The police found that Elangumaran had masterminded the robbery after Ganesan’s relative, R. Gopikumar (31), had spoken to him about the huge number of valuables the octogenarian had at his home. Along with the head constable and his brother and Gopikumar, the accused roped in three persons, already involved in various crimes, Magesh Varma (26), Alex Kumar (38) and Moorthi (33), all from Madurai and a driver, Ajay Saravanan (21). Consequently, Elangumaran, who was absconding, was arrested on Saturday. “Gopikumar had incurred huge losses in his business and wanted to make up for his loss. Elangumaran was his friend and the duo hatched the conspiracy for the robbery,” the SP said. Elangumaran, who had complained of ill-health, was given light duties at the government hospital outpost. Consequent to his arrest, the head constable was placed under suspension, Mr. Manoharan, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/head-constable-arrested/article37744844.ece
29 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Chief Minister inspects flooded areas on outskirts of the city||Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Sunday visited flood-affected areas such as Padmavathi Nagar, Velappan Nagar and Shanmuga Nagar in Thiruverkadu and parts of Thirumullaivoyal on the outskirts of the city. The Chief Minister, who walked the entire stretch between Velappan Chavadi and Padmvathi Nagar, also visited the camp where people from the flood-hit area had been accommodated. “Water entered these areas because the flow in the Cooum was much higher than its capacity. The Chief Minister studied the map to know the course of the river and urged us to take measures to avert such incidents,” said Milk and Dairy Development Minister ‘Avadi’ S.M. Nasar, who accompanied Mr. Stalin. “We are able to mitigate the damage even though rainfall is heavier than what it was in 2015 since we had made preparations and cleaned the canals. Heavy rain coupled with water released from Andhra Pradesh caused the flooding. On Saturday night, these areas were under 4.5 feet of water,” Mr. Nasar said. Future precautions He said the 500 m length of the canal would be repaired to avert flooding. Mr. Stalin also visited flood-hit areas in Avadi, where the water was being pumped out. He spoke to the people and advised them to take care to avoid infectious diseases and vaccinate themselves against COVID-19. The Chief Minister also consumed tea at a roadside shop.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chief-minister-inspects-flooded-areas-on-outskirts-of-the-city/article37744801.ece
29 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||After the latest spell of floods, focus shifts to waterway widening||Flooding in more than 700 locations of the city and protests by residents in waterlogged areas have shifted the civic body’s focus to waterways restoration projects. The Cooum and Buckingham Canal are expected to be widened for carrying more floodwater from various parts of the city. A series of meetings with the Water Resources Department and the Chennai Rivers Restoration Trust (CRRT) was conducted by the Greater Chennai Corporation recently, focussing on flood mitigation initiatives along Cooum, Adyar, Kosasthalaiyar and Buckingham Canal. The Corporation has proposed to create multiple outlets along the Buckingham Canal to drain excess floodwater from the city. Several drains have already been linked to the canal under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) and World Bank funds in the past few years. Similar to the Adyar Poonga, which has become a buffer during floods in the area, other proposals for restoration will be modified, officials said. “Work on demarcation of boundaries of the Buckingham Canal has started. The work will be completed in a few months,” said an official of the Water Resources Department. The final decision on increasing the width of the canal will be taken only by the government. Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said under the river restoration efforts, the civic body, along with CRRT, is laying the boundary walls and fencing off Cooum and Adyar rivers. “So far, there has been progress in more than 50% of the works in both rivers,” he said. “The Corporation is tasked with preventing garbage from being dumped in the rivers. It is an ongoing process. That said, over the course of the project, in the Cooum, close to 90,000 tonnes of debris and over 15,000 tonnes of garbage have been removed by the Corporation. Likewise, in Adyar, so far, close to 50,000 tonnes of debris and a little over 6,000 tonnes of garbage were cleared,” Mr. Bedi added. Alternative housing Residents in flooded areas such as Radhakrishnan Nagar along the Cooum organised a protest last week, demanding alternative housing. At least 8,000 families along the Cooum and Adyar are yet to be given alternative housing. V. Jayaraman, a resident of Radhakrishnan Nagar, Arumbakkam, said his house had been flooded for the past few days, and the water level started rising on Sunday. As the water is neck-deep in houses near the river, residents have vacated, leaving behind valuables. “We have been given accommodation in a marriage hall. But the space is inadequate for 600 families. We request alternative housing in the city. We do not want houses on the outskirts,” he said. Residents said 13 rows of houses along the Cooum river banks in Arumbakkam were flooded on Sunday. B. Saranya, a resident, said her neighbour gave birth to a baby girl on Saturday during the floods. “The mother and newborn will have to be taken from the hospital to the flood relief centre again on Wednesday. We are not sure if the waters will recede by Wednesday,” she said. The Corporation has been providing food for the residents. But a few have demanded blankets. Of the 60 habitations along the Cooum, more than 10 habitations have been resisting resettlement to the suburbs, demanding better houses in the city, near their source of livelihood. Officials of various line agencies have been talking to residents, explaining about the initiatives taken by the State government to control flooding and provide alternative housing in the city. Egmore MLA I. Paranthaman said he had held meetings with officials to explore the possibility of providing alternative housing within city limits in his constituency for residents relocated from waterways and footpaths.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/after-the-latest-spell-of-floods-focus-shifts-to-waterway-widening/article37744809.ece
29 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Enhanced surveillance is State’s priority, says Health Secretary||In the wake of the new variant of the novel coronavirus, Omicron, enhancement of surveillance and sequencing efforts, for better understanding of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, is among the State Government’s priorities, Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said. At the same time, the Health Department will focus on extending vaccination coverage, especially among priority populations initially targetted for inoculation, who remain unvaccinated or are not yet fully vaccinated. The use of masks, physical distancing, hand hygiene and improving ventilation of indoor spaces remain key to reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and even Omicron, he said. A higher level of adherence may be required to control transmission, with a more transmissible variant, he said in a letter to all Collectors, the Greater Chennai Corporation, the Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine and airport directors. He highlighted the need to tighten COVID-19 disease control measures, including the tracking of travellers returning or transiting from ‘at risk’ countries. For enhanced surveillance, he said they should monitor and implement the guidelines for travellers from abroad and those from ‘at risk’ countries. He said if there were reports of rapidly spreading outbreaks in healthcare facilities or communities in the future, such events must immediately raise concern that they could be due to a variant that spreads more easily. Contact tracing of COVID-19 cases with an epidemiological link to the affected areas is strongly advised, he said. As part of preparedness activities, in anticipation of COVID-19 caseload and associated pressure on the health system, districts have been advised to ensure that mitigation plans are in place to maintain essential health services. Necessary resources should be in place to respond to potential surges. Medical infrastructure that was upgraded in anticipation of the next surge should be sustained, he said. “Ensure that an early warning system, composed of a set of indicators such as rapid growth, case incidence and test positivity proportion, is in place,” Mr. Radhakrishnan said. Testing kits in government laboratories have the capacity to identify S-gene dropout. As S-gene target failure is indicated for Omicron, it can be used as a marker for the variant, he said. In case another major surge of cases, driven by Omicron, the consequences will be tough, and therefore, all measures should be taken to prevent its entry into the State, the Health Secretary said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/enhanced-surveillance-is-states-priority-says-health-secretary/article37744785.ece
29 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Our job is to ensure alternative governance’||Tamil Nadu Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan on Sunday said the non-BJP-ruled States should look at delivering an alternative governance model based on the idea of “human being society” and real governance, which is the best thing to do as the Opposition in the run up to 2024 general elections. “Our job is to show an alternative model that shows a government and governance structure, and where you can ask why should you settle for not having food, jobs, medical treatment but have jingoism, false pride of Hindutva or hatred of Islam or whatever,” he said during a webinar - ‘From Mixed to Crony Capitalism: Re-defining India’s political economy?’, organised by Dravidian Professionals Forum. “You don’t have to settle for that. There is actually governance that can deliver for you. You can retain your self-respect and dignity, participate in the process and get good jobs for your children, good food and better houses ,” Mr. Thiaga Rajan said. According to him, post Uttar Pradesh Assembly election in 2017, the BJP has not won any State election convincingly. Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) MP Manoj K. Jha said the Opposition should come together for an alternative programme. “The question should be ‘if not Modi’s kind of politics, then what kind of politics?’ The alternative model should talk about radical programmes in terms of an economic model which is more inclusive, a social model where you don’t sell fear to the majority,” he said. Ece Temelkuran, author and political commentator said, the “if not Modi, who, if not Erdogan (Turkey President), who” kind of questions means “we have lost democracy already up to a certain degree.” Politics should strengthen people’s faith in themselves and the world. All protests should be gathered with dignity, which activates the masses so that they do not make choices against their interests, she said. This is already happening as seen during the Glasgow climate summit and through the Indian farmers’ movement, Temelkuran said.  There is governance that can deliver.

29 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Rain fills up most of the tanks in two neighbouring districts||The consistent rainfall this season has helped most of the tanks in the districts surrounding Chennai fill up. In Kancheepuram and Chengalpattu, nearly 874 tanks have reached their maximum capacity. Both districts together have 909 tanks. Most of the large tanks, including Madurantakam, Sriperumbudur and Uthiramerur, have filled up. As a token of gratitude, residents of Edamichi near Uthiramerur offered flowers and fruits at the tank in the village that has filled up for the second consecutive year. D. Balaji, president, Edamichi Lake Water Users Association, said, “We still follow our forefathers’ tradition of paying respects to the rain and the waterbody, which is a major source of our livelihood. We even release a one-gram gold mangalsutra , along with coconut, in the water.” Spread over 400 acres, the lake is the source of water for irrigation and drinking water supply in three villages. The surplus water released from this lake joins the Palar through the lakes in Salavakkam and S. Mambakkam. Six waterbodies falling in the Chennai limits, too, are full. In Tiruvallur district, 248 of the 818 tanks, including those maintained by the Water Resources Department, are full. As the Poondi reservoir received a heavy flow of 12,000 cusecs, the discharge into the Kosasthalaiyar was steadily increased to 12,000 cusecs by Sunday evening. The district administration issued a flood warning to villages downstream and those falling in the city limits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rain-fills-up-most-of-the-tanks-in-two-neighbouring-districts/article37744797.ece
29 November 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||‘Bariatric surgery aids long-term weight loss’||The advantages of bariatric surgery were discussed by a panel of doctors during a webinar titled ‘Advantages of Bariatric surgery’, organised jointly by Naruvi Hospitals and The Hindu on Sunday. The panelists spoke about obesity and its determinants- Body Mass Index (BMI), waist circumference and waist-hip ratio. Consultant General and Laparoscopic Surgeon Dr. Tushar Yashwant Sonavane of Naruvi Hospitals, Vellore said, “The magnitude of the problem is high. The world is getting fatter and fatter every day.” He further said 33% of world population (1.2 billion) are either overweight or obese. If steps are not taken, by 2030, 57.8% of world population (3.3 billion) will be obese. In India, obesity has more than doubled in the last ten years, which increases the risk of diabetes by 80- 85%. Thirty percent of urban children suffer from obesity, he said. He explained that obesity could cause pulmonary disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, gall bladder issues, gynaecologic abnormalities, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, stroke cataracts, coronary heart diseases and even cancer. He added that medical therapy has limited short-term and almost nolong-term success. “The chance of a morbidly obese person to reduce weight below 35 BMI is 3% or less. Morbidly obese individuals are not able to exercise enough because of joint pains,” he explained. The panel said bariatric surgery for morbid obese patients can produce greater long-term weight loss, more physical activity, lower energy intake. It aids recovery from risk factors as diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia as compared to standard lifestyle management. The surgery in obese patients was associated with reduction in overall mortality as compared to conventional treatment in contemporaneously matched obesity controls. Bariatric surgery as compared to intensive medical therapy alone results in superior and sustained glycemic control and weight reduction in three years after intervention, the panel said. Dr. Tushar also said that diseases like asthma, high cholesterol, high BP, stress urinary incontinence, heart diseases, gastroesophageal reflux disease and depression can also be resolved.

29 November 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Two Korean nationals vanish from custody||In filmy style, two Korean nationals allegedly escaped from police custody in Chengalpattu district last month. The suspects arrested in a GST evasion case were under detention in a private accommodation where they climbed down from the 8th floor to the 6th floor and made good their escape, police sources said. The Tamil Nadu police have launched an investigation as to how the suspects managed to escape and reach Imphal in Manipur. Investigators suspect that the duo would have crossed the international border in an attempt to reach South Korea. The suspects, whose names were given as Choe Jae Won and Choi Yung Suk, were arrested in 2019 in connection with the tax evasion to the tune of a few crores of rupees and lodged in the Special Camp in Tiruchi. Their plea for detention in a private accommodation was dismissed by the Madras High Court. However, the Supreme Court allowed their plea and directed the Tamil Nadu police to take appropriate steps, the sources said. The suspects moved into a flat of their choice on the 8th floor in a multi-storeyed apartment in Orgadam, Chengalpattu district. A police guard was deployed on the floor round-the-clock restricting their movement.  After specific intelligence that the suspects were planning to escape, the Chengalpattu police intensified surveillance on the duo. But on the night of October 29, 2021, they climbed down from the 8th floor to the 6th floor. How they managed to move into the flat and then walk away is under investigation. Police were perusing the CCTV footage in the area and roads leading to the apartment. Investigators suspect that they travelled to Hyderabad by road and then took a flight from there to Imphal on October 30. “It is possible that they would have crossed the Indian border to a neighbouring country. They had local support to arrange their travel. It is also possible that they would have procured fake documents to facilitate their crossing the international borders,” a senior police officer told The Hindu on Sunday. Police sources said efforts were on through diplomatic channels to check whether the suspects had landed in South Korea.

Problems in alternative housing, resettlement of residents along the waterway’s course, canal widening and challenges in linking drains directly with it are expected to slow down the project. Line agencies had identified as many as 21,334 families along the 48 km length of the Buckingham Canal for resettlement. But resettlement and restoration is expected to be challenging because of the unwillingness of residents to relocate from such habitations. The number of families within the demarcated boundaries of the Buckingham Canal is expected to be significantly higher than the previous estimate of 21,334.

The State Government highlighted that the Supreme Court, in several decisions, had held that the Constitutional power conferred on the President and the Governor to grant pardon was neither a matter of grace nor a matter of privilege, but an important Constitutional responsibility. The counter affidavit further pointed out that the CBI, which probed the assassination and prosecuted the convicts, had opposed any move to release the seven convicts.  Though the writ petitioner had heavily relied upon the Supreme Court’s verdict in Maru Ram versus Union of India (1980) to contend that the State Government could release her without waiting for the Governor’s nod, the counter affidavit referred to the same verdict and stated that a convict could be released only upon issuance of a Government Order. “The present writ petition is not at all maintainable either in law or on facts,” the counter affidavit, filed by a Joint Secretary, on behalf of the Home Secretary, read.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dismiss-rajiv-case-convicts-release-plea/article37744791.ece

29 November 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Shortage of M-sand and blue metal hits construction activities||Almost 80 % of construction activities in and around Chennai remain suspended because of high cost of building materials and shortage of M-sand and blue metal, according to builders. R. Radhakrishnan and M. Mohan, former presidents of Builders Association of India (BAI), and R. Sivakumar, chairman of the Association - Tamil Nadu, told presspersons here on Sunday that price of cement and steel increased by 40 % since January this year. While the construction cost was Rs. 2,000 a sq.ft. earlier, it is Rs. 2,800 now. Futher, promoters cannot take full input tax credit for the GST paid and hence, most of the hike in raw material prices have been passed on to the consumers. This has led to slowing down of construction activity in both, private and government sectors. In Chennai and nearby districts, the woes of the builders and consumers are compounded by shortage in availability of M-sand and blue metal, they added. K. Chinnaswamy, president of Tamil Nadu Stone Quarry, Crusher and Lorry Owners’ Association, said of the 3,500 quarries in the State, nearly 1,500 remain shut. The problem started a couple of years ago when the State government asked quarries to get separate licence for stock yards at the quarries and transit pass for movement of the products. There are about 500 quarries in Chennai and nearby areas and at least 30 big quarries are not operating for the last few months. Only 10 % to 15 % of the two lakh tonnes a day M-sand requirement of the four districts in Chennai region is available now and this has resulted in the prices doubling, said Mr. Sivakumar. With stringent implementation of the licence requirement at quarries, construction activity is hit badly in Chennai region for the last three or four months, they said. Mr. Radhakrishnan urged the State and Central governments to redress the grievances of the builders. Mr. Chinnaswamy said the State government should not ask for the transit pass and separate licence for stock yard at the quarries. The BAI organised Builders’ Day events here on Sunday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/shortage-of-m-sand-and-blue-metal-hits-construction-activities/article37744842.ece
29 November 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Residents wait for water, UGD connections as Corpn. is yet to migrate to new system||Coimbatore Corporation, it appears, is sitting on applications for bulk water and underground drainage connections from residents. Sources familiar with the issue said in a few zones the applications date as far back as January this year. The reason was that the Corporation has not been able to process the applications because the migration to the Urban Tree Information System was incomplete. A few months ago, the Corporation migrated to the new system to be on a par with other urban local bodies. After the first stage of migration was complete, the Corporation said residents could pay property tax, water charges on the new system. But it could not complete the entire operation like enabling applying for bulk domestic connection and underground connection. The Coimbatore Corporation Licensed Plumbers’ Association had flagged the issue to the Corporation saying not only was there a delay in processing applications, the ones that it processed after migration were incomplete as well. The Corporation sources said after migration to the Urban Tree Information System, the Corporation noticed that a few processes needed to be automated like estimating the cost of fee to be collected from residents, for both bulk water connection and underground connection. The Corporation wanted the automation to be in such a way that if the Corporation entered the width of the street and other parameters, the new system should automatically give the fee. Likewise, the system should also be able to calculate the UGD charges based on property tax value. The Corporation sought the changes because they were unique to the city and were based on by-laws it had passed over the years. Based on the inputs, the Urban Tree Information System developers were working to bring about the changes and very soon the task would be complete. And, thereafter the Corporation would be able to process the bulk water connection and underground drainage applications, the sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/residents-wait-for-water-ugd-connections-as-corpn-is-yet-to-migrate-to-new-system/article37744849.ece
29 November 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||‘Reduce speed of trains on the stretch at night’||With three elephants being killed on the railway lines connecting Kerala and Tamil Nadu via Walayar on Friday, activists have reiterated their demand to bring the permanent speed restriction (PSR) to below 40 kmph. Though the Palakkad Division said the train was running within PSR when it hit the elephants, several Forest Department officials and activists suspect that it overshot the limit. The adult female elephant, which was found pregnant during the autopsy, was dragged by the locomotive for around 130 m, according to the Forest Department. N.I. Jalaluddin of the Coimbatore-based Nature Conservation Society said the Railways should reconsider reducing the current PSR. Farmers from the village where the incident occurred also felt the speed should be reduced at night. “The speed should be brought below 40 kmph to avoid further fatalities among elephants. It should be brought to 30 kmph, as in the case of the 45-km stretch of Punalur-Sengottai. If required, due to the up gradient, Railways can use a banker (locomotive used to haul a train up a steep gradient),” said RTI and railway activist R. Pandiyaraja. According to the Palakkad Division, a PSR of 45 kmph is imposed for the 13.9-km vulnerable section in the A line and 19.41 km of vulnerable section in the B line, from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. The PSR is 65 kmph during the day. A loco pilot said there would be technical difficulties in reducing the speed beyond a level on the stretch, as a banker will be required due to the up gradient on the stretch. Conservator of Forests S. Ramasubramanian said the chip of the speedometer of the locomotive that hit the elephants would be examined by railway authorities, in the presence of Forest officials, on Monday, to check the speed of the train at the time of impact.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/reduce-speed-of-trains-on-the-stretch-at-night/article37744794.ece
29 November 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Expedite road widening work, says consumer organisation||The Coimbatore Consumer Cause has urged the Departments and institutions concerned to take necessary steps and widen the road near the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University in the city. According to K. Kathirmathiyon, secretary of the consumer organisation, the Highways Department has plans to widen the road and is also looking at a flyover at the Lawley Road junction. However, it needs land to proceed with the proposals. These plans are under discussion for almost a decade now. The subject was discussed at the recently held meeting of the District Road Safety Committee too. An official of the Highways Department said that they were working on an alignment that would involve minimum land acquisition.  Land acquisition Mr. Kathirmathiyon said the entire stretch from Mettupalayam Road to Lawley Road junction and beyond that needs to be widened. Central and State government organisations should part with land available for public projects and there should not be delays in land acquisitions for road or flyover works.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/expedite-road-widening-work-says-consumer-organisation/article37744851.ece
29 November 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Rail line had electric fences on either side||The farmland on either side of the rail line where a train knocked down three elephants in Coimbatore district on Friday night had electric fences, which could have restricted the movement of the animals, according to nature enthusiasts. They said the elephants — a pregnant female, an adult ‘makna’ and a calf — could have walked alongside the track, even after sensing that the train was approaching, because of the presence of the electric fences. Nature enthusiast K. Mohanraj said the farmland on both sides of the A line had electric fences. On the right side of the line towards Coimbatore, where the incident occurred, two-layer fencing was done, he said. Another nature enthusiast said that being very intelligent, elephants would try to avoid a fenced area. K. Kalidas, of ‘Osai’, an environmental organisation, said those into agriculture in the area were traditional farmers whose intention was only to safeguard their crops from elephants and wild boars. According to the Forest Department, the nearest reserve forest area from the accident spot is around 200 metres. Officials said the elephants could have been hit while they were walking away from the forest, possibly for raiding crops. The Palakkad Division of Southern Railway said the Mangaluru- Chennai Express (12602) hit the elephants while they were “crossing” the track between Walayar and Ettimadai. “The loco pilots stated that the visibility was very poor on the stretch and they did not see the elephants until the locomotive came very close to them. They said they did not have the reaction time to avoid the collision,” Conservator of Forests S. Ramasubramanian said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rail-line-had-electric-fences-on-either-side/article37744793.ece

In a letter addressed to Chief Minister M.K. Stalin and others, the organisation’s president C.M. Jayaraman and secretary V.A. Shanmugham wrote that this step would prevent the farmers from destroying tomatoes during excessive yield times. “There are times when tomatoes are sold at lesser than the plucking costs of Rs. 2 a kg or lower. During such times, tractors are driven over the tomato fields to crush the plant,” the letter claimed. The pulp processing plants for tomatoes and other agriculture produce such as mangoes and tamarinds could be set up at Oddanchatram in Dindigul district, Thanjavur and Coimbatore, the letter suggested. The organisation’s letter was also addressed to Minister for Food and Civil Supplies R. Sakkarapani, Commissioner of Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection Department V.

The wards newly added to the Corporation area, including Koodal Pudur, Anaiyur, Park Town, P and T Nagar and Kosakulam, were in bad shape. Similarly, in some places close to the High Court Bench such as Uthangudi on the periphery, knee-deep water forced the residents to stay indoors. Ellis Nagar 70 Feet Road and some interior roads in the locality have been rendered unmotorable and some stretches remain even dangerous, as described by the residents. Not only slush, but garbage too had not been removed in the area, they said. Even before the rain, S.S. Colony, DSP Nagar, Sammattipuram and Harvey Nagar had bad roads, which was attributed to ongoing underground work. Vythianathapuram in Sellur and surrounding areas had stagnant water on the roads.

Justice K. Murali Shankar observed that social networking had become the most ordinary tool for spreading hate speech. “The freedom of speech and expression is an internationally recognised right. However, freedom of speech is not regarded as absolute, when the same conflicts with other rights and protections.” Article19 (1) (a) of the Indian Constitution provided the right to freedom of speech and expression. However, Article 19 (2) of the Constitution also provided for reasonable restrictions against freedom of speech in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality or in relation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence, he said. Article 19 (3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights contemplated that the right of freedom of speech could be regulated in order to honour the rights of others and in the interest of public order, public health or morals. Article 10 (2) of the European Convention on Human Rights provided reasonable duties and restrictions during the exercise of one’s fundamental right to free speech, the judge observed. The court was hearing two bail petitions filed by YouTuber ‘Sattai’ Duraimurugan.He was booked for making derogatory remarksagainst former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi and the present Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on a YouTube channel, and for passing certain remarks on Mr. Stalin at a demonstration held in Thuckalay in Kanniyakumari district. The petitioner filed an undertaking affidavit stating that he would not make any derogatory remarks against any person in the future. Considering the affidavit and taking into account the fact that he had certain health issues, the court granted him bail with conditions. He was directed to deposit a sum of Rs. 50,000 to the credit of the Chief Minister’s Public Relief Fund.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/youtuber-sattai-duraimurugan-gets-bail/article37744932.ece

29 November 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Oussudu lake’s potential remains untapped||The immense drinking water and irrigation potential of the Oussudu lake, the largest freshwater lake in Puducherry with an ayacut of more than 2,000 acres, remains untapped. The accumulation of an enormous amount of silt in the lake has drastically reduced its storage capacity and, in turn, denied water to irrigate farms in nearly 50 villages, the locals say. The Oussudu lake has a storage capacity of 540 million cubic feet, but the actual storage is much lower. Farmers have consistently demanded the desilting of the lake and the implementation of long-pending modernisation works, including the strengthening of the bunds, to improve the water-holding capacity of the lake. “In 2008, the government had proposed a Rs. 40 crore drinking water project with the Oussudu lake as the source. The project envisaged the supply of 20 million litres of drinking water every day. As part of the project, it was proposed that a treatment plant would be set up at Muthirayarpalayam and treated water pumped to houses through existing pipelines,” says K. Ramamoorthy, president of Sembadugai Naneeragam, an environmental organisation. “Though funds were sanctioned, the work did not take off due to reasons best known to the officials. The pipelines laid from the Oussudu lake to the Aayi pond for a distance of 4.5 km are broken at many places. The project should be revived,” he said. “The traditional water storage structures are being destroyed due to siltation, lack of upkeep or pressures of urbanisation, he added. “The government is interested in infrastructure projects, but it has no interest in this basic activity. Siltation in the lake is defeating the very purpose of the sprawling waterbody, and the government is not serious about it,” a water expert said. During the recent spell of rain when there was a heavy flow of water from the Veedur dam and Sankarabarani river, the Oussudu lake did not get as much water as it should have due to heavy siltation and encroachment of the feeder channels. “It is important that these waterbodies are desilted and rejuvenated. This will not only improve the storage capacity but also reduce the impact of floods at the local level,” Mr. Ramamoorthy said. “Though Puducherry received heavy rainfall during the current monsoon season, we have been losing the vital storage capacity of major waterbodies like the Oussudu and Bahour lakes due to lack of desilting,” an official said. Official sources said a proposal to draw drinking water from the lake had been hampered by environmental clearance regulations as the waterbody was a protected bird sanctuary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/oussudu-lakes-potential-remains-untapped/article37745229.ece
29 November 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Intense rain disrupts normal life||The district administration has declared a holiday on Monday and Tuesday for schools and colleges in Puducherry and Karaikal following forecast of heavy rain for the next few days. Incessant overnight rain and intense showers through the day disrupted normal life and inundated several low-lying areas across the city and suburbs. Puducherry received rainfall of 37 mm for the period from 8.30 a.m. on Saturday to 8.30 a.m. on Sunday and 78 mm of rainfall on Sunday till 4 p.m., District Collector Purva Garg said.

The outflow from Veedur Dam at 4p.m. was 7,035 cusecs and it was 6,800 cusecs from Sathanur Dam. The major Ossudu and Bahour tanks were filled up to Full Tank Level (FTL). The banks of rivers Sankarabarani and Thenpenniyar were under constant watch/surveillance by PWD officials. Trees that fell on Aravindar Street and Gingee Street corner were cut and removed immediately, the Collector said. Heavy waterlogging was also reported in areas, including Indira Gandhi statue, Rajiv Gandhi statue, Sivaji statue on ECR Road and residential neighbourhoods, such as Rainbow Nagar, Bussy Street, Solai Nagar, TV Nagar, Kosapalayam, Kompakkam, Achariyapuram, Kalmandapam and Ariyapalayam. Teams from the PWD-Muncipality departments were engaged in pumping out excess water in these areas. In the Revenue (North) jurisdiction, about 80 persons in settlements behind the airport in Lawspet and at Ariankuppam were shifted to relief centres after water entered their homes. Meanwhile, after taking stock of the situation, Education Minister A. Namassivayam directed the Education Department to declare a holiday for schools and colleges in Puducherry and Karaikal for two more days following forecast of more rain. The administration has already set up around 200 relief shelters to accommodate people needing evacuation from their homes due to heavy rain. Arrangements are in place to provide amenities at these camps. All relief shelters are kept open and nearly 3,500 food packets have been distributed on Sunday. Arrangements are in place to distribute food packets to the affected public on Monday as well. As per the IMD forecast, heavy rain is expected tonight and all Government teams are ready for on-field deployment for rescue and relief operations.

29 November 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Govt. should intervene to reduce vegetable prices: CPI||The Communist Party of India has urged the territorial administration to immediately intervene and reduce the rise in prices of vegetables. The CPI State council meeting held at the party office at Mudaliarpet on Sunday passed a resolution urging Chief Minister N. Rangasamy to make necessary intervention in the market to bring down the prices of vegetables. The government should call a meeting of wholesale dealers to discuss the ways to reduce the prices. The party has decided to organise a campaign across the Union Territory on December 8 to collect signatures of people to highlight the poor infrastructure. The roads have become unfit for smooth ride in Puducherry, party secretary A. M Saleem said. The CPI also flayed the approach of the Chief Secretary and Secretaries in estimating rain damage to seek relief assistance from the Centre. The officials have pegged the loss at around Rs. 17 crore whereas the actual damage was much higher. The Disaster Management Authority has become defunct in Union Territory, he added. On the demand raised by the Chief Minister for Statehood at the South zonal meeting in Tirupati, the party said there was no point in making the demand while being an ally of the BJP as the Centre had made it clear that Statehood could not be given to the Union Territory. “If the Chief Minister is really interested in getting Statehood, he should seek the support of the parties in the Union Territory genuinely interested on the issue and put up a united fight,” Mr. Saleem said. Former member of Parliament S. Aziz Pasha and other senior leaders also participated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-should-intervene-to-reduce-vegetable-prices-cpi/article37745235.ece

The protest was led by M. Jebajothi, town treasurer of Virudhunagar District Fireworks and Match Industries Workers Association. Speaking on the occasion, CITU district secretary P.N. Deva said joined crackers constituted at least 25% of the total fireworks production. Similarly, most of the fireworks were made using barium nitrate. “If both joined crackers and barium nitrate are banned, only 20% of the crackers can be manufactured and it looks like the industry is not prepared to reopen given their plight.” Stating that the Centre should intervene in the issue, he said it should clarify to the Supreme Court about importance of barium nitrate and joined crackers for the survival of the industry. He complained that Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation, which was the licensing authority for the fireworks units, had failed to impress upon the apex court on the important issues.

Water from Kudamuritti canal, which makes its way to the Cauvery near Tiruchi had overflowed into Fathima Nagar, Beschi Nagar, Shakthi Nagar and other nearby colonies. As the banks of the Kudamuritti breached late on Friday night near Karalamman Temple, behind Fathima Nagar, the residents had immediately contacted the district administration which made temporary arrangements by stacking sandbags. A section of the residents said that they had alerted the Public Works Department two days ago, but the authorities paid no heed. “There is a drainage sluice on the other side through which water flows. Seeing the force of the water flowing through it, we were able to tell that the bank was weakening.

29 November 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||‘Cover guest lecturers under group insurance scheme’||The Tamil Nadu All Government College UGC Qualified Honorary Lecturers Association has urged the CM to cover the teachers in this category under medical insurance. Citing the death of a guest lecturer in the Orathanadu Goverment Arts College, State president of the association V. Thangaraj said a reasonable compensation has to be provided to the families of guest lecturers who die in harness. It will be ideal to cover the guest lecturers in all government colleges under a group insurance scheme, Mr. Thangaraj said. Unlike in the erstwhile constituent units in other State varsities where teachers of institutions that have been converted into government colleges receive Rs. 20,000 as monthly salary, those in 10 such institutions in the ambit of Bharathidasan University are paid only Rs. 15,000. Over the last five months, the guest lecturers have received salary only for three months, due to which they were facing mounting problems at personal levels. So far, 13 guest lecturers have died due to emotional stress, and illness, he said. The insufficient remuneration has made things worse; there have been instances of several guest lecturers divorcing their spouses due to the financial predicament, Mr. Thangaraj said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cover-guest-lecturers-under-group-insurance-scheme/article37744942.ece

29 November 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Our priority is to drain rainwater from low-lying areas: Monitoring Officer||Draining rainwater from low-lying areas and temporary restoration of badly damaged roads with filling of debris would be accorded top priority now, said District Monitoring Officer Apoorva here on Sunday. Ms. Apoorva, along with Collector V. Vishnu, Corporation Commissioner Vishnu Chandran and officials, inspected many affected areas in the city and peripheries. Speaking to reporters, she said with dry spell prevailing now, restoration works had picked up momentum. For the time being, the objective was to clear encroachment on waterbodies and carry out repair works, which would give relief to vehicle users. Asked about the long-term plan, she said it might be suggested to authorities not to carry out digging work across all wards in the city. For instance, underground drainage works would be taken up for short distances of about three km. Upon completion, the next three km could be covered for laying pipes. However, the idea would be taken up for discussion with the supervisory executives at the ground level before taking a final call. Desilting of tanks would be accorded priority as conservation was important. Above all, storm water drainage was also a must. With the northeast monsoon remaining active, residents might have understood the importance of water bodies and hoped to keep them intact. Asked about the assessment of crop damage in the district, Ms, Apoorva said it would begin soon. “We are waiting for the water to drain in the fields. Preliminary works had already begun.” When scribes complained about the nonchalant attitude of some senior officials in the Corporation due to which people suffered, she said the administration had been doing things. A lot of new construction was coming up under the Smart City initiatives. Hence, there were bound to be inconveniences. Not that no work was carried out. “Now, we have received the funds. With proper planning, under the leadership of the Collector and the civic chief, works will be implemented. Strict action will be taken to remove encroachment by private people,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/our-priority-is-to-drain-rainwater-from-low-lying-areas-monitoring-officer/article37745280.ece
29 November 2021||TIRUPATTUR,TAMIL NADU||Yelagiri Hills are off limits to unvaccinated visitors||The scenic Yelagiri Hills are now out of bounds for those who haven’t been vaccinated against COVID-19. The Tirupattur administration has made it mandatory for visitors to the hill station to have taken both doses of the vaccine. A special help desk comprising a team of police personnel and district health officials has been set up on the foothills of the Yelagiri Hills, 12 km away from the hillock, to check the vaccination certificates provided by the visitors. The help desk will be open from 6 a.m to 6 p.m. "The aim is to encourage everyone to take the vaccine, especially the second dose. Door-to-door visits for vaccination are also being carried out to cover all tribal villages on the hillock," an official said. The hill station is getting a facelift to draw more tourists from neighbouring areas like Krishnagiri, Vellore, Tiruvannamalai and Hosur. Boathouses are being readied for long-distance travellers, especially those from Chennai and Bengaluru. The boat complex has about 15 fibre boats with a capacity of six persons each. Among the measures being taken are the setting up of more recreational facilities like an open-air stadium, separate parks for fruits, flowers and herbal plants, a botanical garden, additional accommodation for tourists, and better connectivity through frequent buses and better roads. Spread over 80 acres in Pallakanniyur village, a tribal hamlet atop the hillock, the open-air stadium will have space for volleyball, football, badminton, cricket and basketball, and a swimming pool. The stadium will also have an open auditorium with the capacity to accommodate 1,600 visitors. The botanical garden will come up on 25 acres in the same tribal hamlet. The existing lake will be deepened. Trekking will be organised in coordination with the Forest Department. Night safaris at specific places on the hillock are also being planned. Before the COVID-19 lockdown, the hills attracted more than 20,000 tourists, mainly from Bengaluru and Chennai, every month. With the easing of the curbs, they are witnessing a steady flow of visitors, especially during weekends.  Door-to-door visits for vaccination are also being carried out to cover all tribal villages on the hillock||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/yelagiri-hills-are-off-limits-to-unvaccinated-visitors/article37744965.ece
29 November 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||11 held for defrauding bank of Rs. 94.45 lakh in Kotagiri||The Nilgiris district special branch police arrested 11 persons and are on the look out for 27 others on charges of defrauding a bank of Rs. 94.45 lakh at Ellada in Kotagiri between 2018 and 2020. The police said that the men conspired with the appraiser at the bank, identified as Siva, in obtaining loans in exchange for fake gold ornaments that were pledged at the bank. The fraud had gone undetected for more than two years between July 2018 and September 2020. The men had allegedly used the money they borrowed from the bank to lend small loans to farmers and local residents. Though they had made profit using the money, they failed to repay the amount owed to the bank. After the incident came to light, the bank manager approached the Nilgiris district police and lodged a complaint. Following an investigation, the police arrested B.Ravi (40), R. Mahalingam (36), A.Sudhakar (43), R.Kanagaraj (30), N. Krishnamoorthy (40), M. Lingaraj (52), B. Mahadevan (53), M. Sekar (50), N. Sumath (40), R. Ganesh (30) and M. Natraj (46).

29 November 2021||November 29 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Sasikala is no longer a liability factor, says AIADMK veteran||The AIADMK’s minorities wing secretary, former Labour Minister and former Ramanathapuram MP, A. Anwhar Raajhaa , appears to be a restless person. Not given an opportunity to contest in the 2019 Lok Sabha and 2021 Assembly elections, the 72-year-old leader is one of those in the party who have been openly calling for a debate on the issue of readmission of former interim general secretary V.K. Sasikala. Though he favours her return, he tells The  Hindu he will abide by the party’s decision. A critic of the BJP, Mr. Raajhaa says the present arrangement of dual leadership in the AIADMK has failed to deliver. Excerpts:  What lessons has your party learnt from the successive defeats in the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections? What lessons should be learnt by it? I don’t think the party has learnt any. As for the lessons to be learnt, the party did not stitch the right coalition and it had not undertaken any review of the matter. There was no deep discussion on why the party, which bagged 37 seats in 2014, could win only one in 2019. The trend continued in 2021. Besides retaining the same coalition, the party suffered two setbacks. We did not receive the complete support of the Vanniyars, who were given 10.5% quota [within the overall quota of 20% for the Most Backward Classes and Denotified Communities]. The campaign in the southern districts that the new quota had denied opportunities [to the others in the MBC and DNCs] had eroded the AIADMK’s votebase. In the northern districts, other communities, too, turned against us. The party base among the Scheduled Castes had also taken a beating. What is your take on the perception that the AIADMK is getting weakened day by day, and the BJP is trying to occupy the position of the principal Opposition party? I don’t see anything wrong in the BJP trying to gain a foothold in the State. But the AIADMK should not give room for that. People have been nursing grievances against us for allowing the BJP to ride piggyback on us. However, it will not be so easy for the BJP to be successful. Moreover, by having an alliance with it, there was no gain for us; we had only lost our vote. What is the reason for you to keep on saying that Ms. Sasikala should be taken back? Had she been with us, the party would have won 20 more seats. Had chemistry, too, worked, we would have got 40 more seats, as her presence and campaign would have sent out a message that the AIADMK was reunited. Don’t you see her as a factor of liability? Initially, I mean it was there in 2017-19. But it went down gradually. Now there is sympathy for her. Won’t her family again dominate the party affairs? I do not believe it will happen again. During the brief period that she was in control of the party, those who got positions of power in the government, such as D. Jayakumar [who held the portfolio of Finance in 2017] and K.A. Sengottaiyan [who became School Education Minister], did not belong to Mukkolathor, her community. This showed her approach, which I hope will continue. But [the party co-coordinator] Edappadi K Palaniswami has been fiercely opposing her... My feeling is being shared by 99% of the party workers. Why are you silent on T.T.V. Dhinakaran? He is no longer with our party. He is in the AMMK. Besides, he is not a matter of the current discussion. What is your assessment of the dual leadership? It has more de-merits than merits. There is no unanimity of views between the two [coordinator O. Panneerselvam and Mr. Palaniswami]. Just to ensure that the party does not suffer a split and lose its symbol, the two are adopting a give-and-take policy. OPS is much more accommodative than the other. So, the dual leadership has not benefited the party Absolutely. Do you want the system of single leadership to be restored? Yes, provided the workers support it. And such a leader should be elected by all primary members. Are you making the demand on Ms. Sasikala because you had once benefited from her politically, or her return would benefit you? I have no such intentions. At this point of my life, I have nothing to lose. I have been in the party since 1972 and in politics since 1965. As I feel pained to see the party’s plight, I am making the demand. Leave aside her. All I want is let the party elect one as leader and remain united.  Had she [Ms. Sasikala] been with us, the party would have won 20 more seats.... her presence and campaign would have sent out a message that the AIADMK was reunited||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sasikala-is-no-longer-a-liability-factor-says-aiadmk-veteran/article37744790.ece
29 November 2021||November 29 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Nithyasri Mahadevan enthrals the audience||The second day of Ragapriya concert series featured a vocal concert by Nithyasri Mahadevan with orchestral support from M.A. Krishnaswamy on the violin, Neyveli Skanda Subramanian on the mridangam and Tiruchi Krishnasamy on the ghatam. Nithyasri started with ‘Thanjam endral’, an Abhogi Raga varnam by Papanasam Sivan, by invoking the blessings of Kapali (Lord Shiva) of Mylapore, which caught the attention of the rasikas at the very beginning of the concert. ‘Okapari Judagarada’ by Saint Tyagaraja in ragam ‘kalavati’ was rendered next, in which the Saint pleads with Lord Rama to look at him once like He looked at sage Suka. Then came Dikshidar’s ‘Chetha Shree Balakrishnam Bhajare’ in ‘Dwijavanti’, which was rendered effortlessly with the able support of the percussionists. The singer then presented an old favourite, popularised by D.K. Pattammal, ‘Vinave O manasa!’, by Saint Tyagaraja. The main song, ‘Parama Pavana Rama’ in ‘Poorvi Kalyani’ by Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar (teacher of Ariyakudi), was well delineated and appreciated by audience. The singer and the percussionists maintained the metronome throughout the song. The violinist played complex phrases very nicely with the singer right from the well delineated alapana to the chittai swaras. Both the mridangist and the ghatam vidwan showed their maturity in their support to the singer during the ‘Tani avardanam’. ‘Mamadurai Meenakshi’ on Goddess Meenakshi in the words of Kallidaikurichi Sundaram, in raga ‘Bagesri’ and ‘Ragathil Sirandathu’ (with the conclusion that one which has proper shruti, svara and sukha bhavam) of Kadalur Subramaniyam in ‘Ragamalika’, a ‘thillana’ in ‘Nalina kanthi’ were the final pieces rendered. The audience were satisfied with the energetic singing. S. Padmanabhan||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nithyasri-mahadevan-enthrals-the-audience/article37745142.ece

He is openly asking voters that they should cast their first priority vote for the BJP and the second for his brother (and Independent candidate Lakhan Jarkiholi),’’ he told journalists. This was in response to the statement of Congress MLA Lakshmi Hebbalkar that Ramesh Jarkiholi was betraying the BJP now, just as he had betrayed the Congress in the last Council polls. “Ms. Hebbalkar is desperate. She does not know what to do. That is why she is making such noises. Why did she not make such a statement when Ramesh Jarkiholi was in the Congress and she knew that he was betraying the Congress?’’ he asked. “There is no confusion among our party workers about Mr. Kavatagimath’s candidature or his victory,’’ he said.

Even vaccinated persons have to produce the RT-PCR negative certificate. At Chikkodi in Belagavi, the police took a doctor from Maharashtra, who allegedly tried to assault a policeman on duty, into custody on Sunday. Argument with staff Swamy Nandimath, a doctor from Kolhapur, was stopped at the Kuganoli checkpost and allegedly refused to show his RT-PCR negative test result and argued that he did not need one, as he was vaccinated. Health officials have also heightened vigil at inter-State checkposts in Mysuru, Chamarajanagar, and Kodagu. Only persons possessing an RT-PCR negative report with sample collected less than 72 hours earlier are being allowed to enter the State. Buses too Dr. K.H. Prasad, Mysuru District Health Officer, said that even buses would be stopped at the border checkpost and officials would physically check for the RT-PCR negative reports. However, the personnel in goods vehicles that transport tomatoes and other vegetables, besides poultry products between the two States on a daily basis would have to produce the RT-PCR negative certificate once in 15 days. In Boodagumpa village of Karatagi taluk in Koppal district, Hucchappa Chalavadi climbed atop a roof of a house refusing to get vaccinated. Juber Malagi, PDO, had to climb atop the roof to convince the man to get down. It was only after doctor Imtiaz guaranteed that there would be no adverse health effects from the vaccine that the man got himself the vaccine.

30 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Shivaram Karanth Layout: SC regularises 300 buildings||The Supreme Court, in its recent order, has instructed the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) to regularise 300 buildings that were built in the area notified for the formation of the Shivaram Karanth Layout. Owners constructed these structures between 2014 and 2018. The regularisation of the 300 buildings has come as a huge relief to property owners. The court also directed the BDA to issue regularisation certificates to the owners in a transparent manner within four weeks under the supervision of the committee. The authority has also been asked not to acquire or take possession of these properties subject to the order issued on December 3, 2020. The SC order is based on recommendations by the Justice A.V. Chandrashekar Committee that was constituted to identify lawful buildings in the notified area. Jayakar Jerome, former commissioner of the BDA, and S.T. Ramesh, former Karnataka Director-General of Police, are members of the committee. The committee has A.V. Chandrashekhar former judge of the Karnataka High Court, as its chairperson. The committee had received over 6,000 applications from building owners in the notified area, both offline and online.  Physical inspection Through physical inspection by the officials and scruinity of the documents available, the committee decided when applicants had constructed the buildings: before 2014 or between 2014-18, as well as those built after the Supreme Court order. “Collecting and scrutinising data gathered is an exhaustive exercise,” said Mr. Ramesh. “Firstly, we dealt with buildings that came up between 2014 and 2018. The year is significant because in 2014, the Karnataka High Court had struck down the notification issued for formation of the layout. Later it was challenged before the Supreme Court and in 2018 the SC upheld the notification and directed the BDA to go ahead.” According to Mr. Ramesh, out of the 300 buildings a majority of the owners had not taken permission from authorities such as the BDA or the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike or from local panchayats to construct the buildings before the Supreme Court issued the order. “In the first batch, we have identified 300 structures that were constructed before 2018. Though these were constructed without approval, demolition is not an option. Many of the owners had power supply or were paying taxes. It is a peculiar situation. These structures had come before the Supreme Court issued order on the formation of the layout and owners did not have any intention to violate the order. Hence, we recommended regularisation of these structures.” Mr Ramesh said. After scrutiny of the remaining applications, the committee will submit reports to the Apex Court in batches. In October, the BDA demolished many structures that had come up in the notified area after 2018. At the time, officials had said that they had identified over 500 ‘illegal’ structures in the notified area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/shivaram-karanth-layout-sc-regularises-300-buildings/article37744751.ece
29 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Attempt to divert SC/ST funds as ‘deemed expenditure’ continues||Attempts to divert funds meant for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes welfare in the State under the “deemed expenditure” clause continues to be a bone of contention in Karnataka. While the State Government diverted funds for purposes other than welfare of SCs/ STs last year, top government sources said that attempts are being in the same direction this year too. This comes even as the Social Welfare Department opposed diversion made in 2020-2021 by the Finance Department. In the midst of severe financial crunch following the lockdown in March/April/May in 2020, the State Government had diverted over Rs. 5,000 crore from different departments citing the “deemed expenditure” clause though the Karnataka Scheduled Castes Sub Allocation and Tribal Sub Plan (Planning, Allocation and Utilisation of Resources) Act, 2013, does not allow such bulk transfers.  At a review meeting recently, the Social Welfare Department refused to accept deemed expenditure to a tune of 75% of the allocated amount to the Water Resources Department for the previous fiscal, and asked it to spend the pending amount on the welfare of SCs/STs. “There are overt attempts being made to divert funds this year too. Such requests were made in the meeting,” an official privy to the developments in the meeting said. He said that the “deemed expenditure” clause can be cited only in those expenditures that cannot be divided specifically. “Even when deemed expenditure is calculated, it is only a portion of the larger expenditure that can be considered. This cannot exceed 7% as per the guidelines of the Union Government. How can 75% in the Water Resources Department be considered as deemed expenditure? In fact, funds to a tune of Rs. 1,000 crore is sought to be diverted to fund road projects in PMGSY as deemed expenditure by the RDPR department.” ‘Cannot be allowed’ Speaking to The Hindu , Social Welfare Minister Kota Srinivas Poojary said deemed expenditure cannot be allowed if it is not spent as per guidelines. “In Karnataka, more than 5 lakh SC/ST families do not have homes. The government needs Rs. 50,000 crore to ensure housing. In such a scenario, deemed expenditure cannot be allowed. We have said either transfer back the money to Social Welfare Department if it is unspent or spend it for the benefit of the community,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/attempt-to-divert-scst-funds-as-deemed-expenditure-continues/article37744771.ece
29 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Never thought a stand-up comedy act would be cancelled in our city’||Stand-up comedians in the city expressed outrage and disappointment after they learned that Munawar Faruqui’s show, scheduled to be held on Sunday, was cancelled after the police “advised” organisers to call it off citing possible law and order problems. “What is happening with Mr. Faruqui is incredibly unfair with his shows being cancelled for a joke that he did not even say. Taking away the right to perform before an audience for a stage artist is incredibly cruel and involves questions of the right to freedom of expression and livelihood,” said Shunky Chugani, a city-based comedian. Other artistes that The Hindu spoke to also condemned the police action and systematic targeting of Mr. Faruqui by the Hindutva right wing, but were wary of making a public statement for fear of being targeted. “I am from a minority community and I feel like I need to watch every word I utter. I feel extremely vulnerable and targeted,” said a Muslim comedian from Bengaluru. Others said that such an action will give rise to “self-censorship” in an entertainment space that prides itself on giving the unvarnished truth . “I never thought something like this would ever happen in our city which is known to have a mature audience and is cosmopolitan and liberal. It makes me very sad. This is a symptom of a much deeper malaise that has set-in, and we need to do something about it,” said comedian Kjeld Sreshth. Stand-up comedian Ajay Samson said Mr. Faruqui’s social media posts hinting that he would be giving up the space reflected the deep frustration at how he has been hounded.  It is sad that a systematic campaign by Hindutva groups has scuttled a comedian, just because of his religion Vinay Sreenivasa, Advocate-activist   A threat of protest leads to the stifling of freedom of expression in this city.

29 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||One more bill irregularity emerges||The bill scam, which has been detected in Karnataka Neeravari Nigam (KNN) where accounts officers allegedly connived with contractors to raise bills for work not implemented, has now gone up to Rs. 28.35 crore. While eight fake bills worth Rs. 16.62 crore were found to have been raised in Hipparagi Barrage Canal Project in Athani division initially by eight officials to help two contractors, it has now been detected that 20 bills were raised to siphon off Rs. 11.73 crore in the Irrigation Projects Department in Kalaburagi division and Tungabhadra Left Bank Canal Project in Sirawar in Munirabad division by 16 officials to help six contractors. Same modus operandi Similar to the bill scam in Hiipparagi project, these fake bills have been raised for works that do not exist. Neither tenders were called nor works were executed in these cases. In the normal course, the file for bill clearance is prepared by the field staff, including Assistant Engineer or a Junior Engineer based on the work in progress, which is then moved up to the office of the Chief Engineer after scrutiny at multiple levels. After the due process is followed, it is then sent to the office of the Chief Accounts Officer where it is checked again before the money is released to the contractor. In these cases, the fake bills were prepared and cleared in the Accounts Department. The officials have been accused of creating fake documents to support release of funds directly to the accounts of contractors. Of the 16 officials involved in the case, one official passed away and 10 officials have retired. Five suspended The remaining five serving officials have been placed under suspension, and directions have been issued to initiate criminal action against the 15 officials/retired officials and six contractors. The government on Saturday ordered freezing of bank accounts, and the Department of Stamps and Registration has been directed not to allow any transactions in immovable assets in the name of accused officials and their family members.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/one-more-bill-irregularity-emerges/article37744769.ece
29 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||School managements, parents for hybrid model of teaching||Schools and colleges have just about managed to bounce back this academic year with offline classes resuming over the past few months, but the emergence of COVID-19 clusters in educational institutions and the new Omicron variant of the virus has parents, students, and managements worried. Some schools have appealed to parents to ensure that their children return straight back home after classes and not to mingle with friends outside the school campus. Others are batting for hybrid models of education involving offline and online learning. D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary, Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools, said that while schools were following stringent measures laid down in the SOPs, they were unable to monitor lapses outside the campus. He also urged the Government to ensure that there were curbs and checks on tutorials where hundreds of students were made to sit in a single classroom without adequate social distancing. Primary and Secondary Education Minister B.C. Nagesh said that he was aware that some private schools were also merging sections and conducting classes for over a hundred students at a time due to staff problems. “We will have a meeting on how to regulate this and think of solutions. I will also convene a meeting with department officials to discuss how residential schools and PU colleges can step up safety measures,” he said. C.N. Ashwath Narayan, Higher Education Minister, said that educational institutions should allow only visitors who have received both doses of the vaccine. Nooraine Fazal, founder-director of Inventure Academy, said that schools need to be prepared for a hybrid model, one that would allow them to switch between online and campus-based learning seamlessly. “Faculty members and students need to undergo sensitisation and training to ensure they maximise learning. The approach needs to ensure children are engaged, connected, challenged and happy,” she said. Shweta Sharan, founder of Bangalore Schools, said: “This virus is here to stay and will be part of our lives for some time to come. As a parent, I would want schools and educational institutions to continue stringent safety protocols and to not let their guard down. As parents, we need to do our part too and adhere to these protocols. We need to stay safe and be vigilant,” she said. She too batted for hybrid schooling so that they could cut down risks by not eliminating in-person schooling altogether.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/school-managements-parents-for-hybrid-model-of-teaching/article37744760.ece
29 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Council polls: JD(S) to decide on support to BJP in a couple of days||The JD(S) will decide whether to transfer its votes to BJP in constituencies it is not contesting in a couple of days. “Senior BJP leader B.S. Yediyurappa said that he has placed the proposal on seeking JD(S) help and is waiting for my response. We will decide on the proposal in a day or two,” JD(S) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy told presspersons at Kolar. While polls are being held for 25 seats in Legislative Council from 20 Local Authorities constituencies across the State, JD(S) had decided to field candidates for seven seats. On Saturday, it withdrew its candidate from Kodagu Local Authorities, reducing its contest to six constituencies. Mr. Kumaraswamy also clarified that so far he has not said anywhere that the JD(S) would support BJP. “My statements at Chickballapur have been misunderstoodNo other leader from BJP except Mr. Yediyurappa has sought our help.” “We will take a decision that will help our candidates win the elections,” he said. “The party has fielded candidates only in constituencies where we are capable of winning since our focus will remain on the 2023 Assembly elections,” he added. Recent statements by Mr. Yediyurappa seeking JD(S) support had raised eyebrows, and critics pointed out that it was another example to show that the JD(S) and BJP had a secret pact. Congress leaders, including former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, have been terming JD(S) as “B team” of BJP since the 2018 Assembly elections. Sources close to Mr. Yediyurappa said, “In any case, they have to vote for someone. So Mr. Yediyurappa had sought those votes for BJP. Formally, he has not met anyone in JD(S).”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/council-polls-jds-to-decide-on-support-to-bjp-in-a-couple-of-days/article37744770.ece
29 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Govt. advises schools, colleges to postpone social, cultural events||With COVID-19 clusters detected in colleges and schools in Mysuru, Dharwad, and Bengaluru, and fears of a resurgence with the emergence of the Omicron strain, the Government, on Sunday issued fresh measures that educational institutions should take. In a circular, the Department of Health and Family Welfare advised educational institutions across the State to postpone social and cultural events for two months. The advisory stated that conferences, seminars, academic events, etc., in educational institutions, wherever possible, may be postponed. “Alternatively, it could be conducted in hybrid mode with minimal physical attendance and with more persons attending through virtual mode,” it noted. Daily screening The department has also made it mandatory for medical, paramedical and other such educational institutions to screen their students daily for symptoms. Students with symptoms of COVID-19 should be tested and treated as per the guidelines, it stated. It also reiterated that heads of educational institutions should take utmost care to ensure Covid Appropriate Behavior (CAB) within campuses especially if they are organising events. Heads of educational institutions have been instructed to ensure that students and staff above 18 years are vaccinated at the earliest, if they haven’t been administered their shots yet. The department also urged healthcare professionals to send out positive messages to people in other fields when they conduct conferences and seminars virtually. The circular was issued a day after Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai held a high-level meeting on Saturday on the management of COVID-19. The circular also stated that students who have arrived from Kerala to medical, paramedical colleges, and other such educational institutions in Karnataka over the past 15 days be subjected to a mandatory RT-PCR test. “Students arriving from Kerala to medical and paramedical colleges and other such educational institutions within Karnataka shall be subjected to mandatory RT-PCR test on their arrival,” the circular stated. Deputy Commissioners of the districts bordering Kerala (Dakshina Kannada, Kodagu, Chamarajanagar, and Mysuru) are vested with the responsibility to screen all those coming from Kerala as per protocol. The department has decided to go a step further when COVID 19 clusters are reported. Even people in a cluster who have tested negative will have to undergo further quarantine and get tested again when it ends. Students and the general public visiting Karnataka daily for the purpose of education, business, etc., will have to undergo RT-PCR test once in two weeks and need a negative RT-PCR test to gain entry into Karnataka.  The circular also stated that students who have arrived from Kerala to medical, paramedical colleges, and other such educational institutions in Karnataka over the past 15 days be subjected to a mandatory RT-PCR test.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/postpone-social-cultural-events-govt/article37744759.ece

The deceased was identified as Nisar. He was married to Ayesha, 45 . According to the police, on November 19, Nisar decided to muder his wife and make it look like an accidental death.

29 November 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Child rights commission to hold hearing for ST children||To understand the problems faced by children from tribal communities, the Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (KSCPCR) has decided to hold a public hearing exclusively for them. The hearing is scheduled to begin on December 1. Fr. Antony Sebastian, chairperson of the commission, said they had been holding several public consultations with children and listening to their woes after the pandemic. “Children have been sharing very heart-wrenching stories of how they did not have access to online classes, how many were forced into child labour; some students even said that their friends were victims of child marriages during the lockdown,” he said. Members of the commission pointed out that the problems faced by children from tribal communities as well as their magnitude would be extremely different from minors belonging to other communities. The pandemic and subsequent lockdowns had exacerbated the situation, especially as children did not have access to online classes. Nagasimha G. Rao, director, Child Rights Trust, said according to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), children belonging to ethnic, religious, or linguistic minorities or persons of indigenous origin, shall not be denied the right to live with the other members of their community. They also have been conferred the right to enjoy their culture. “All the solutions given to these children should consider their preference first. These children cannot be asked to come to cities or towns for education. Anganwadis and schools should go to places where they are located,” he said. The commission plans to address all issues ranging from education and health to poverty and socio-cultural issues, among others. The commission has decided that the hearing shall be held in Mysuru as many people belonging to these communities live in districts adjoining it. They plan to rope in officials from different departments to help address the grievances raised at the hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/child-rights-commission-to-hold-hearing-for-st-children/article37744775.ece

The incident came to light on Sunday, when a video clip and photos showing manual scavenging went viral on social media. Manual scavenging has been prohibited and whoever violates the law attract punishment as per the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act 2013. Two workers were spotted clearing a pit in Ward 17 of Holenarsipur Town Municipal Council. While one person had got down the pit, another was assisting him from outside. When The Hindu contacted V.D.Shanthala, chief officer of Holenarsipur Town Municipal Council, the officer suspected it to be a foul play by a couple of people, working as drivers on a contract basis. “There was no need for the workers to get down the pits, as we have sucking machines. The machines were used to clear the choked underground drains. In fact, the staff cleared the sewer lines using the machines on Saturday. However, in the evening two people with vested interests forced the workers get down a pit and took the videos. We are trying to contact them, but their phones are switched off”, she alleged. The officer said she would file a complaint against the workers, who were behind the incident. “We have been strict in implementing the law that prohibits employment of manual scavengers.

Mr. Eshwarappa, who is also in charge of Shivamogga district, has instructed the police not to punish the shopkeepers, stating that they (the police) would attract his wrath if they did not follow his instruction. A delegation of shopkeepers had met the Minister in Shivamogga on Friday. The Minister had spoken to a police officer over the telephone on this issue. A video clip of his telephonic conversation, with the speaker turned on, has gone viral. Poser The Minister is seen enquiring with the police about their action against shopkeepers who sold cigarettes. When the officer at the other end tried to convince the Minister that they were acting as per the COPTA, Mr. Eshwarappa wondered if there was a law prohibiting shops from selling cigarettes. He also wanted to know if the law was being implemented only in Shivamogga. Even as the police officer said the police had been acting as per the instruction from the senior officers, the Minister said the police were free to punish to those smoke in public places. “Why are you penalising shopkeepers? If they are not allowed to do business, how can they survive? Have you fallen sick?” he asked. Further he said the police should spread awareness on the law among the shopkeepers before implementing it. The COPTA prohibits shops from selling cigarettes within a radius of 100 yards from education institutions. Besides that, shopkeepers are not to sell cigarettes to any person below the age of 18 years. And, shops should not display advertisements promoting tobacco products. Those who violate the law attract action. The police can impose penalty and seize tobacco products found in the shop. ‘As per law’ When The Hindu contacted Shivamogga SP B.M.Laxmi Prasad, the officer said the police had been acting as per the law. However, he refused to comment on the Minister’s instruction to police officers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/eshwarappa-finds-fault-with-police/article37745185.ece

A similar resistance from an old woman was reported from Iliganur village in the same taluk on Sunday. Shivagangamma, who appeared to be more than 80 years old, refused to get vaccinated when the Health Department officials came to the village. When the repeated requests and persuasion from the officers went in vain, the local youth had to allegedly forcibly carry her and get her vaccinated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/man-climbs-atop-roof-of-house-to-avoid-vaccine/article37745006.ece

29 November 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Riverbank being fenced to stop debris dumping, encroachment||The Mangaluru City Corporation along with the district administration has undertaken a fencing-cum-tree sapling plantation project along the southern bank of the Phalguni (Gurupura) from Kulur bridge to Bangrakulur to prevent dumping of debris and encroachment. There has been rampant encroachment of the riverbank for more than a couple of acres, particularly at Kodikal-River Festival Road Junction. While builders are said to dump debris on a vacant land that once housed the RTO driving test track along National Highway 66 at Bangrakulur, a few local residents with vested interests reportedly transported debris and dumped them into the Phalguni to reclaim the riverbed. Building and plastic waste and other waste thus were getting into the aqua system thereby threatening the coastal ecology as well. A Bangrakulur resident told The Hindu on Sunday that the city corporation undertook the fencing project after Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra visited the spot recently and issued the necessary directions. Dr. Rajendra had earlier said that the administration was tied up in COVID-19 management and could not give immediate attention towards riverbank encroachment. Every step would be taken to protect the ecosystem in the region, he had then said. Meanwhile, corporation Commissioner Akshy Sridhar said that the project involves fencing on about a 3-km stretch of the Phalguni riverbank right from Kulur Bridge on NH 66 till the end point — Dambel Riverside. The riverbank is being cleaned using earthmovers, while concrete poles are being erected for fencing at present. Trenches too are being dug for planting tree saplings, he said. The corporation will in association with the Forest Department plant about 3,200 saplings along the riverbank shortly. Once the planting was completed, the fencing work will be carried out, he said. These measures, Mr. Sridhar hoped, should prevent further dumping of debris and growth of natural vegetation. In fact, large tracts of Kandla (mangrove) plants along the riverbank have been destroyed due to encroachment. Asked whether the debris could be cleared by churning them during the monsoon, Mr. Sridhar said that the volumes are huge. They are up to 12 ft deep at some places. Moreover, they also contain plastic waste and letting it into the aqua system is not advisable, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/riverbank-being-fenced-to-stop-debris-dumping-encroachment/article37745157.ece
29 November 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Round-the-clock screening, testing on border with Kerala||Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra on Sunday said the administration will intensify and conduct round-the-clock screening and testing of travellers from Kerala to the district in view of the enhanced COVID-19 threat. Dr. Rajendra told reporters here though the administration had upped the testing and checking at borders since four months, it became somewhat lax for the last one month after drastic reduction in cases. Still, Kerala reports about 8% test positivity rate and hence there was need to enhance surveillance. The Chief Minister on Saturday has directed to deploy police and other department personnel at border check posts to intensify screening and testing. Police personnel were already deployed at check posts and personnel from other departments would join from Monday. It was herculean task at the Talapady check post on NH 66 where about 60 vehicles pass in a minute, he said. The Deputy Commissioner said the administration faces challenge in screening and testing as people in Kasargod in Kerala and Dakshina Kannada districts share close bond while about 40% people in Kasargod depend on Dakshina Kannada for their routine activities. The borders are too porous thereby intensifying the challenge. “We treat them as our own people and conduct screening and testing causing the least inconvenience,” he said. A list of regular travellers would be prepared and periodical testing/ checking would be conducted. Inter-State bus services would continue for now; but bus crew have to ensure passengers possess RT-PCR test negative certificate, Dr. Rajendra said. As far as international travellers arriving in the district, the Deputy Commissioner said RT-PCR negative certificate was mandatory while boarding the flight itself. Passengers from red-list countries would be tested again on their arrival at Mangaluru International Airport and irrespective of negative report, they would have to undergo a week’s home quarantine, he said. He would soon hold meeting with airport authorities in this regard, the Deputy Commissioner added.  Udupi Deputy Commissioner M. Kurma Rao in a statement said daily testing would be increased from 3,000 to 4,000 as per government directions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 new variant. More random tests would be conducted for students and educational institutions staff, people working in hotels, restaurants, malls, shops, catering, door delivery, industries, pubs, bars and offices. While 50% of the test targets would be done in Udupi, the rest would be done in rural areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/round-the-clock-screening-testing-on-border-with-kerala/article37745166.ece
29 November 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||‘Parties not keen on mitigating sufferings of Saraswaths of Kashmir’||No regional or national political party has an agenda to mitigate the sufferings of Saraswaths of Kashmir, regretted Kashinath Pandit, retired director, Centre of Central Asian Studies, Kashmir University. Political parties have also not shown any inclination to take Saraswaths back to their 6,000-year-old homeland in Kashmir, he said. Delivering the keynote address at a one-day conference on “A Confluence of Saraswaths Worldwide” organised by Vishwa Saraswath Federation here on Sunday, Prof. Pandit said that the genocide and complete ethnic cleansing of Saraswaths of Kashmir took place in the 1990s. It has forced the nearly four lakh Kashmiri Saraswath Hindus to live as refugees in their own country for the last 32-years. The present situation calls for introspection among the scattered Saraswath community, which must unite and contribute to national identity. The Saraswaths are inheritors of a great civilisation, which must be taken forward, he said. Prof. Pandit said that the 4,000-year-old Hindu Kingdom of Kashmir declined and fell to the Muslim invaders around 1339. The sultans replaced the rajas and ruled over Kashmir from 1339 to 1819. The only task that these Kashmiri Muslim sultans, including the Mughal and Uighur rule during 1586-1751, had was to destroy all traces of ancient Hindu civilisation of Kashmir and decimate the Saraswath Hindu community, he said. The decimation process ended in 1990, Prof. Pandit said and added that the Saraswaths must know their true identity like never before. The community is a big economic and social if not political power, he said, while exhorting the Kashmiri Saraswaths not to be bogged down as a minority. The entire Saraswath community in India has to understand the plight of their Kashmiri fraternity expelled from their homes at the point of a sword. He urged Sri Samyamindra Tirtha Swami, head of Sri Kashi Math, to constitute a five-member committee to examine and analyse the genocide and ethnic cleansing of the Kashmiri Saraswath Hindu community. Earlier, Sri Samyamindra Tirtha released Saraswath Awakening, a pictorial representation of his recent visit to Kashmir. The yatra acted as a unifying bridge for an emotional connection between the Kashmiri Pandits and the Saraswath community.  The 4,000-year-old Hindu Kingdom of Kashmir declined and fell to the Muslim invaders around 1339 and the sultans replaced the rajas and ruled over Kashmir from 1339 to 1819, while their only task was to destroy all traces of ancient Hindu civilisation of Kashmir and decimate the Saraswath Hindu community, Prof. Pandit says and adds that the decimation process ended in 1990||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/parties-not-keen-on-mitigating-sufferings-of-saraswaths-of-kashmir/article37745159.ece

In a letter to CM Basavaraj Bommai on Friday, Mr. Manippadi said, “It is so disheartening to see our government run by a party supposed to be a party with a difference - BJP and having trust and hope in Prime Minister Modi Ji’s concept of ‘Sab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas’ which here in Karnataka is not being practised. It is painful to know of the sufferings of Muslims in Karnataka everywhere. I meet my Muslim brethren and they complain that BJP Government is ill-treating, harassing and threatening them with dire consequences.” He said the Muslim community in Doddanagamangala village in Bengaluru South taluk was unable to get a burial ground despite a court order in 2005. During the pandemic, Muslims had to bury dead bodies in far-off places incurring huge expenditure, he said. There was no Muslim burial ground in the village and up to 6-7 km in surrounding areas. The two-acre land in Survey No. 5 was not given to Muslims despite proper allotment, he said. Notwithstanding prompt efforts by Bengaluru Urban Deputy Commissioner J. Manjunath, nothing has happened till date.

Chairing a meeting with Superintendents of Police of all units in Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Uttara Kannada and Chikkamagaluru districts here, Mr. Sood told officers to work in a complimentary manner with the Central investigation agencies. “Drug peddling is among the issues concerning national security and has to be effectively tackled.

29 November 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||COVID-19 testing target increased||The daily target for collection of samples for COVID-19 testing in Mysuru district has been increased from the present 3,000 to 5,000. Mysuru District Health Officer K.H. Prasad told The Hindu that the health personnel will carry out random testing of shopkeepers and salespersons at malls and markets, staff of hotels and restaurants, students, teachers and other staff in colleges among others in the coming days. The increase in daily testing target is part of the State Government’s decision to augment the surveillance by revising the daily target for the State in view of the clusters of COVID-19 cases reported in different parts of Karnataka including Mysuru. More than 60 students from two different nursing colleges in Mysuru had tested positive about a week ago. Officials from the Health Department, who suspected the infection to have spread from students from bordering States studying in the nursing colleges of Mysuru, said the students, who had shown an RT-PCR negative report while entering the State, had tested positive about 15 days later while in Mysuru. Though RT-PCR that is less than 72 hours old has to be produced at the time of entering the State, the officials said the incubation period for COVID-19 stretches upto one or two weeks, which may the reason for the students to test positive about a fortnight after entering the State. Meanwhile, another official said the Health Department will be targeting all the 12 nursing colleges Mysuru and has already begun collecting samples from the students of the colleges. The nursing colleges have a lot of students from bordering States, the official said. Also, apart from continuing with the targeted testing of cases of ILI (Influenza-like Illness), SARI (Severe Acute Respiratory Infection), contacts of positive cases and high-risk groups, the Health Department officials have been asked to conduct fortnightly random testing of selected groups like students and teachers of colleges and high schools, staff of hotels and restaurants, shopkeepers of malls and markets, catering staff and door delivery personnel, factory personnel, office-goers, service staff in pubs and bars, attendants in cinema halls and multiplexes, besides others who are in crowds by vocation. The Government has also asked the officials to ensure that at least 50 per cent of the samples should be from the district headquarters and the rest from the rural areas, ensuring 10 per cent of the samples are taken from children. The officials have also been asked to ensure that atleast 5 per cent of the children in schools are tested every week to assess their safety.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/covid-19-testing-target-increased/article37745183.ece
29 November 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Vigil heightened at inter-State checkposts||Amid the scare over a possible rise in COVID-19 cases on account of the threat posed by Omicron variant and the cluster outbreak in parts of State including Mysuru, health officials have heightened vigil at inter-State checkposts in Mysuru, Chamarajanagar, and Kodagu. Only persons possessing an RT-PCR negative report with sample collected less than 72 hours earlier are being allowed to enter the State check through the Bavali checkpost on the Karnataka-Kerala border, health officials in Mysuru said. Even vaccinated persons have to produce the RT-PCR negative certificate. Though the protocol had already been in place for the last couple of weeks, the vigil had been heightened in view of the fresh scare over cluster outbreak and the Omicron variant, an official added. Travellers in private vehicles as well as those in buses would have to mandatorily produce the RT-PCR negative reports at the checkpost, said Dr. K.H. Prasad, Mysuru District Health Officer. Even buses would be stopped at the border checkpost and Health Department personnel along with police officials would physically check for the RT-PCR negative report from each passenger, said Dr. Prasad, who visited the checkpost on Sunday along with H.D. Kote’s Taluk Health Officer Ravikumar. However, the people in goods vehicles that transport tomatoes and other vegetables, besides poultry products between the two States on a daily basis would have to produce the RT-PCR negative certificate once in 15 days. Health officials also said that the contact number and addresses of persons passing through the checkpost would be noted down. Between 150 and 200 vehicles entered Karnataka from Kerala through the Bavali checkpost, officials said. Meanwhile, similar vigil has been mounted at checkposts in neighbouring Chamarajanagar and Kodagu. Deputy Commissioner of Chamarajanagar Charulatha Somal visited the inter-State checkpost at Moolehole in Gundlupet taluk on Saturday night. Apart from instructing the personnel to mandatorily check for RT-PCR negative report that is less than 72 hours old, Ms. Somal checked the register maintained by the officials to keep a tab on the vehicles passing through the checkpost. She was also accompanied by Additional Deputy Commissioner Kathyayini Devi and Gundlupet tahsildar Ravishankar. The heightened vigil comes after a videoconference Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai had with officials of Health Department on Saturday. “We have been asked to reactivate our surveillance system in view of the detection of the new strain, which has come just about the time when people had begun lowering their guard against COVID-19 thinking that the pandemic is ending,” said Dr. Prasad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vigil-heightened-at-inter-state-checkposts/article37745008.ece
29 November 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Child marriages are on the rise in Mysuru district||More than 180 complaints of child marriages were received in Mysuru district between April and October this year, making it among the highest in the State. Mysuru had the dubious distinction of standing second in the State during the previous year when as many as 301 child marriages or complaints of impending marriages were reported between April 2020 and March 2021. The figures are based on the number of complaints received by the Childline 1098 - a helpline ensuring anonymity to the whistleblower - and spot visits by officials based on the tip-off. Ballari with 374 cases topped the list last year. Deputy Director of Women and Child Welfare Basavaraju said that the department has not let its guard down despite the pandemic and has been conducting awareness camps. “In rural areas announcements are made using the loudspeaker strapped to vehicles besides carrying awareness sessions in schools and the anganwadi kendras about the negative impact of child marriages on the girls’’, he added. The official, however, admitted that the number of cases were high and was being reported with increasing frequency in recent times. But whenever a case is reported then the department files an FIR and initiates legal action against the parents of the minor bride and the groom. The Rural Literacy and Health Project (RLPH) is the collaborating NGO entrusted with operating Childline 1098 and its staff work 24 x 7 basis to receive calls. “The moment a call or a tip-off is received we inform the Department of Women and Child Welfare, Child Welfare Commission and others and raid the venue. In most cases the wedding is prevented and the parents of both the bride and the groom are forced to give an undertaking that they will not conduct the marriage till the girl attains the legal age’’, said Saraswathi, Director, RLHP. She said the number of cases were high during the peak of the second wave of the pandemic. Parents assumed the marriages would not draw any attention, in the belief that the government and its staff would be deployed to handle or manage COVID-19. “In many cases the restrictions that existed during the peak of the pandemic on the number of people who could attend wedding was cited as a reason by the parents for rushing through the marriage as it would bring down the cost’’, said Ms.Saraswathi. But there is also a growing perception that the increase in general awareness about the negative impact of child marriages and the rise in use of the child helpline number by the girls was resulting in higher detections and more complaints. “A sizeable number of complaints – about 30 per cent – of child marriage or an impending wedding comes from the girls themselves or their classmates who take advantage of the child helpline and tip us off’’, according to Shashikumar, Coordinator of RLHP. The cases are from across the district though it is rare in Mysuru city. However, there were high number of cases from Periyapatna bordering Kodagu due to its relative isolation besides socio-economic conditions.  As many as 301 child marriages or complaints of impending marriages were reported between April 2020 and March 2021  Awareness sessions held at schools and anganwadi kendras in rural areas  A sizeable number of complaints of child marriage or an impending wedding comes from the girls themselves or their classmates||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/child-marriages-on-the-rise-in-mysuru-district/article37744762.ece

First there were searches in Bangalore Development Authority offices, followed soon by raids on various government officials by the Anti-Corruption Bureau. In the latest instance, he has ordered scrutiny into all major tendering of works across departments. Interestingly, the last one came about four months after a letter from the registered contractors of Karnataka reached the Prime Minister’s Office alleging that there were demands by Ministers, legislators, and bureaucrats for massive kickbacks for sanction of contracts and clearance of bills. The letter was written on July 6, 2021, before Mr. Bommai took over on July 28, 2021, and his predecessor B.S. Yediyurappa was in office. However, the letter written by the Chief Minister to the Chief Secretary asking for scrutiny of all major works says that it would begin “from the day I took charge as Chief Minister”, giving the impression that it will not cover his predecessors. Curiously enough, speaking at Davanagere on the same day the order was issued, Mr. Bommai said the government will also probe irregularities in tender processing during the Congress rule, citing what he called “percentage culture” that existed back then. This would leave one confused on exactly what would be investigated and of which period. But who cares as long as the narrative is on the right track?   Former Minister A. Manju(in picture)accompanied BJP candidate H.M. Vishwanath while the latter submitted his nomination papers as a candidate for the Hassan Local Authorities’ Constituency in Hassan. The same day, Mr. Manju’s son Manthar Gowda filed his papers as a Congress candidate for the Kodagu seat. While the father was with the BJP, the son was the Congress candidate. Both Mr. Manju and his son Mr. Gowda were once in the Congress. While the former was Minister in Siddaramaiah’s Cabinet, the latter was elected to Hassan ZP. Ahead of Parliament polls in 2019, Mr. Manju joined the BJP and contested for the Hassan Lok Sabha seat on that party’s ticket. However, his son remained in the Congress. How were father and son in different parties? Mr. Manju said his son should have been the BJP candidate in Hassan in the MLC election, but somehow missed it. He said there was nothing new in two members of a family working in two political parties. A few hours later, the BJP relieved Mr. Manju of all responsibilities in the party, in the wake of his son’s contest in Kodagu.   That the elections to the dual-member Legislative Council seat from Mysuru-Chamarajanagar local bodies’ constituency promises to witness a fierce clash between Congress, JD(S), and BJP became apparent at the time of filing nominations itself. BJP candidate Raghu Kautilya, who finished third in the last elections, sought the rejection of Congress candidate D. Thimmaiah’s candidature by contending that his nomination papers were not in order. The Congress leaders accused the BJP of making an issue out of a “minor” error. Eventually, the BJP’s objections were overruled and the Congress candidate’s nominations were accepted, albeit a day late. Soon after, the Congress candidate’s nomination papers were accepted, the party spokesman M. Lakshmana lodged a complaint with the Deputy Commissioner demanding that the BJP candidate’s nomination be rejected, contending that Mr. Raghu had not resigned from the post of chairperson of D. Devaraj Urs Backward Classes Development Corporation. Despite the efforts of the BJP and the Congress to knock out from the fray candidates from their rival party, both have managed to remain in the electoral arena. Bageshree S. Sathish G.T. Laiqh A.

The deceased were identified as Annie Ranjith, 54, of Mararikulam South and her two sons Lenin Ranjith, 36 and Sunil Ranjith, 32. According to the Mannancherry police, Annie’s body was found hanging in her bedroom, while bodies of two sons were found lying on beds in two rooms. The police said the cause of deaths could be ascertained only after the post-mortem examinations. “We are treating the deaths as suspicious. We are awaiting the post-mortem examination reports to determine the cause of deaths,” said an official. Annie was living with her two sons after death of her husband seven years ago.

The temple, one of the ancient sacred precincts in the State, which launched vegetable cultivation and floriculture two months ago, recently ventured into agri-tourism by opening the gates of its thriving organic farm to visitors. Farm tours to fishing and enjoying time in thatched-roof structures, there is a range of activities to keep visitors energised and entertained at the farm situated not far from the temple. The farm, which has 14 varieties of vegetables, including cabbage and cauliflower, fish in four ponds, and a large collection of marigolds and sunflowers, has turned out to be an instant hit, especially among families and young couples. Local cuisine too Visitors can also buy/hand-pick safe-to-eat vegetables from the farmland and taste local cuisine prepared by Kudumbashree units. The Thiruvizha Devaswom, which manages the temple, has set up the farm by transforming 7.5 acres of fallow land in its possession with the support of a joint liability group of farmers, the Cherthala South grama panchayat, the Agriculture Department and the Cherthala South Cooperative Bank. “The devaswom bought 15 acres of land a few years ago with the intention of starting a new venture. But the project got delayed for various reasons, and we decided to utilise the land, which had remained fallow, by launching vegetable cultivation. At present, farming is done on 7.5 acres and we are planning to conduct paddy cultivation in the rest of the land in the coming months,” said Elenjiyil Radhakrishnan, president, Thiruvizha Devaswom. The farming activities are carried out by the members of the joint liability group. The farm produces around 250 kg of vegetables daily. Veggies are mostly bought by visitors, while the rest are sold locally. The majority of the proceeds from vegetable farming and agri-tourism is given to the members of the joint liability group. The entry to the farm is through passes ranging from Rs. 10 toRs. 500.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/where-spirituality-farming-go-hand-in-hand/article37745094.ece

29 November 2021||HYDERABAD,KERALA||Telangana outstanding liabilities cross Rs. 2.52 lakh cr.||The State Government’s total outstanding liabilities at the end of the previous financial year 2020-21 crossed the Rs. 2.5 lakh crore mark. Of the total liabilities to the tune of Rs. 2,52,325 crore, the internal debt component comprising state development loans and other instruments alone stood at Rs. 2.14 lakh crore. The State has also raised Rs. 8,923 crore through bonds, Rs. 7,527 crore through special securities issued to NSSF and Rs. 4,514 crore as loan from Nabard during the period. The total outstanding liabilities of the State were pegged at Rs. 2.19 lakh crore including internal debt of Rs. 1.85 lakh crore by the end of FY20 (2019-20) and Rs. 1.9 lakh crore including internal debt of Rs. 1.56 lakh crore by the end of FY19, according to the Handbook of Statistics of Indian States released recently by the Reserve Bank of India. A major reason for the increase in the outstanding liabilities is the enhanced spending on the social welfare sector. The expenditure incurred by the State on special sector was pegged at Rs. 84,268 crore in 2020-21, a steep rise from Rs. 52,456 crore of the previous financial year. The State incurred the expenditure in spite of the Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic who incidence forced the State to declare a lockout for several weeks. The State’s fiscal deficit grew to Rs. 33,191 crore during 2020-21 from Rs. 21,913 crore of the previous fiscal and it continued to be revenue surplus State at Rs. 4,482 crore for FY21. The State showed significant improvement in the gross enrolment ratio of 88 per cent (87.2 per cent boys and 88.8 per cent girls) in the IX and X standards in 2019-20. The ratio was against 77.9 per cent national average. Enrolment ratio of students in higher secondary XI and XII classes during the period too was impressive at 57.2 per cent as against the national average of 51.4 per cent. The per capita net state domestic product at current prices stood at Rs. 2.37 lakh at the end of the previous fiscal was little than Haryana (Rs. 2.39 lakh) and much higher than neighbouring Karnataka (Rs. 2.26 lakh).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/telanganas-outstanding-liabilities-are-rs-252-lakh-cr/article37745043.ece

Water release to the Periyar was also reduced to140 cusecs from Saturday. Now only one spillway shutter of the dam is remaining open at 10 cm. Tamil Nadu informed Kerala that it stopped the tunnel discharge at 1 p.m. The water level reached 141.70 ft at 3 p.m. from the level of 141.60 ft at the time of stopping the tunnel discharge. Maximum level likely If the situation continues, the water level in the Mullaperiyar dam could reach the maximum level of 142 ft on Monday morning, leading to the opening of the spillway shutters. When contacted, a Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) official said that the reason for closing the tunnel discharge was not informed. After bringing water to 142 ft, Tamil Nadu might release water at the level of the inflow or might draw it through the tunnel. Level in Idukki dips Meanwhile, water level in the Idukki dam declined from 2,400.80 ft at 6 a.m. on Sunday to 2,400.68 ft at 3 p.m. An official at the Dam Monitoring and Research Station said power generation at the Moolamattom power house was at a maximum. The inflow through the Periyar declined, he said, adding that even if water from the Mullaperiyar was released, the immediate opening of the shutters of the Cheruthoni dam of Idukki reservoir would not be necessary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mullaperiyar-tn-stops-tunnel-discharge/article37745095.ece
29 November 2021||KANNUR,KERALA||Water sport ventures found flouting norms in Kannur||With the Malanad-Malabar River Cruise project gaining a lot of attention, private investors have expressed wish to launch various activities, including water sports, to turn the region into an adventure tourism destination. However, the ventures that are coming up reportedly with the backing of local bodies and political parties have been found bypassing environmental impact assessments and clearances from the authorities. Subsequently, environmental activists and members of the public have come out in protest against such ventures citing their impact on ecology and livelihood of local fisherman. Several areas from Mahe to Kavvayi river are covered by the Malanad-Malabar River Cruise project, which falls under the Coastal Regulatory Zone (CRZ). All developmental ventures require prior approval and clearances from the authorities before they are opened to the public. On Friday, Payyanur MLA T.I. Madhusoodanan along with Payyanur Municipal Chairperson K.V. Lalitha inaugurated Xtreme Water Adventures, a private venture in the Kavvayi river. The region with small islands and a large tract of mangrove forest that supports various birds and marine species is an ecologically fragile area and falls under CRZ-1. Still, it is one of the most polluted rivers in the district with high Bacterial Oxygen Demand (BOD) and is under continuous monitoring by the State Pollution Control Board (PCB). Any activity that may possibly affect the river requires prior approval from the board, said K. Anitha, Environmental Engineer, PCB. But no such permission has been granted for the water sports venture for which the company is rolling out Jet Ski speed boats to attract tourists. Since the oil used in the machines may affect the river and marine species, not to mention pollution caused by arrival of tourists, the company should follow certain norms, she said. Apparently, the Municipal Chairperson claimed that permission was granted to the company to start the water sports venture on the eve of its inauguration. On the contrary, Municipal Secretary M.K. Gireesh said he was unaware of it, and that no permission had been sought from the Municipality. When similar activities were launched in the Mayyazhipuzha in New Mahe panchayat, the Mayyazhipuzha Conservation Committee passed a resolution asking the authorities to restrict speed boat services. Committee chairman Shaukat Ali Eroth said the panchayat had granted permission for adventure sports without consultations or discussions. However, the panchayat later gave assurance that the activity would not be allowed. He said it was feared that the vibrations caused by high-speed boats in the water would impact aquatic life, including small fish, plants, and coastal vegetation. He explained that micro-organisms could not withstand excessive vibration and the resultant pressure and heat. It also seriously affects fish breeding grounds. Environmental activist Bhaskaran Vellur said the river water had already been polluted by liquid effluents and solid waste discharged from the shore. Only a few species survive the change in pH value and oxygen content of water. Expressing apprehensions over the construction of boat jetties and terminals, he said the authorities should verify if there were violations. He alleged that officials had failed to check CRZ violations in the district, and that they had not even bothered to reply to RTI queries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/water-sport-ventures-found-flouting-norms-in-kannur/article37745051.ece

29 November 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||KSRTC to get 8 new Volvo sleeper buses||The much-awaited airconditioned Volvo sleeper buses that conform to Euro-VI emission norms will join the KSRTC’s fleet of premium buses in 10 days’ time, for services to Bengaluru. They will operate trips from both Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi to Bengaluru, a route which has demand all through the year, said KSRTC Managing Director Biju Prabhakar. “The eight buses will create history, since it will be the first time in India that a bus manufacturer is building a sleeper-class body,” he said. The body-building job is generally done by firms which have expertise in that field. Each bus priced at Rs. 1.50 crore will have 39 sleeper berths, with charger sockets in all berths. They will also have fire detection and suppression system (FDSS) and CCTVs that face interiors and exteriors. Their light-weight body and BS-VI engine are expected to provide higher fuel efficiency. With the KSRTC not operating sleeper buses to Bengaluru, its Karnataka counterpart and private operators were operating many more services, including sleeper buses, to cities in Kerala. The KSRTC’s services to Bengaluru were hitherto limited to airconditioned and semi-sleeper buses (with recliner seats). On their part, the Railways are still hesitant to introduce adequate number of trains in the sector, despite the whopping demand. Safety concerns “The KSRTC’s sleeper buses are expected to rein in the exorbitant fares that most private bus operators levy on the route, especially during festival seasons. We hope safety concerns like drivers who opt for extended duty hours [like doing continuous/double shift] will be addressed, since exhaustion and driving fatigue cause approximately 40% of road accidents in the country. This could even be the reason for an accident in which a premium bus of KSRTC rammed a lorry from behind while in Tamil Nadu, last week [and the driver suffered serious injuries],” officials said. Drivers opt for this and often compromise on sleep to get four days’ off after doing double shift. Put short, they will thus have to work only eight days a week. This practice is expected to end when K-Swift, a subsidiary of the KSRTC, is formed to operate long-distance services.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/eight-new-volvo-sleeper-buses-to-join-ksrtc-fleet-soon/article37745074.ece
29 November 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Roadblocks faced by Roshni project cleared||The roadblocks before the ‘Roshni’ project for the educational uplift of children of migrant workers in Ernakulam district have been cleared. Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) will extend a financial assistance of Rs. 44.79 lakh for implementing the project till March 2022. The funds will be used to hold the programme in 40 schools in the district. An agreement will be signed between BPCL Kochi Refinery and the Deputy Director of Education, Ernakulam, as part of mutual understanding and cooperation. The project had hit a roadblock after the 40 education volunteers, who form the backbone of the project, were not given their monthly salary of Rs. 10,000 from November last to March this year due to paucity of funds. The Hindu report, ‘Educational project for children of migrant workers in Ernakulam district hits a roadblock’, published on June 9, 2021 had stated that about Rs. 20 lakh was required to clear the salary arrears of the 40 educational volunteers since November. The salary for the first five months of the previous academic year was given using the balance fund available in the academic year 2019-20. The innovative project was launched by the district administration in 2017 with the corporate social responsibility fund of BPCL. The Roshni project had also found mention in the Governor’s policy address last year. However, the revised project proposal in tune with the requirements of the online mode of education was pending before the district administration since August last. District Collector Jafar Malik had taken up the issue with the BPCL authorities. He had termed the Roshni project a “socially-relevant initiative”. The district administration then submitted a Rs. 97-lakh proposal to the company. About 1,250 migrant children enrolled in Classes 1 to 7 across 40 government and aided schools in the district had received the benefit of the programme amidst the pandemic situation. The project uses code-switching as the main pedagogical tool. It involves a speaker alternating between two or more languages in the context of a single conversation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/roadblocks-faced-by-roshni-project-cleared/article37745081.ece
29 November 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Village, beach fests to revive tourism||With incessant rains during the past one month playing spoilsport with tourist arrivals in most locales in Kochi’s suburbs, stakeholders are pinning their hopes on elaborate village and beach festivals whose curtains will go up in December, to reignite interest in tourism locales in Ernakulam. The untimely rainy weather has resulted in tourist footfall in most locales being limited to weekends and public holidays. Cheranalloor fest Foremost among the local-level tourism festivals lined up for the peak tourism season in December is the Cheranalloor Village Tourism Fest, which is planned from December 21 to 31 under the banner of Kerala Tourism, Ernakulam DTPC, and Cheranalloor panchayat. “The coastal village in the city’s suburbs will thus turn alive with a food fest, amusement park, exhibition ground for birds, domestic animals, and even camels, display pavilion for bullock carts, similar modes of ferrying cargo that were in vogue till a few decades ago, and a shopping fest,” said K.V. Rajasekharan, chief coordinator of the fest. This will be apart from stalls selling forest and tribal produce and a State-level tug of war contest in which 32 teams will participate, all of which will be hosted at a shopping village spread over four acres. The fest has been envisaged keeping in mind the romping success of the Kadamakudy Village Fest held a year ago, which witnessed a footfall of around five lakh. Vypeen Folklore Fest With popular beaches in the Goshree Islands like Cherai, Munambam, Kuzhupilly, Vilappu, and Puthuvype witnessing lesser than normal turnout of visitors, a Vypeen Folklore Fest is envisaged from December 1 to 31 at these beaches and other destinations in the isles. “The aim is to develop tourism opportunities in the region and give Vypeen its rightful place as a cultural hub. It will also help hosts and visitors come out of the all-round depression caused by the pandemic,” said K.N. Unnikrishnan, MLA, chairman of the organising committee. A highlight will be a 25-km graffiti, which could be the biggest in Kerala. It will be painted on 75 walls in the region, in tandem with the 75th year of Indian Independence. The graffiti will end at Cherai beach. The occasion will also see portraits being readied of people from Vypeen who played a role in Kerala’s Renaissance movement. Few people know that the march taken out in connection with the Paliam Satyagraha began from Vypeen, Mr. Unnikrishnan said. A total of 500 artistes are expected to participate in the fest, which is being held in coordination with the Kerala Folklore Academy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/village-beach-fests-to-revive-tourism/article37745072.ece
29 November 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Chaos at Collectorate Jn. spills over to approach roads||The inordinate delay in developing the bottlenecked and accident-prone Collectorate Junction and the barricading of a portion of the southern side of the junction for the Kochi metro’s Kakkanad extension have resulted in serpentine traffic hold-ups at and around the junction. The junction on Seaport-Airport Road was expected to be developed by Roads and Bridges Development Corporation of Kerala (RBDCK) many years ago, as part of widening the entire stretch from HMT Junction to Irumpanam in Thripunithura. But the agency could only widen a limited corridor from HMT Junction to Bharat Matha College, following which the road was handed over to the Public Works Department (PWD) in 2020. RBDCK sources attributed the delay to inadequate funds, although land was available to widen free-left turns on the northern side of the junction. It is now up to the PWD to widen rest of the road and decongest Collectorate Junction, they said. Responding to this, PWD sources said there was no immediate plan to widen the junction, although it often figures at review meetings. “Our current priority is to fill potholes on the road, especially at Irumpanam and the bridge nearby. We are well aware of the hassles caused to motorists and pedestrians due to the chaos that prevails at Collectorate Junction, where thousands of lorries carrying fuel, chemicals, construction materials and container cargo vie for space with passenger vehicles.” In all probability, the junction will be widened as part of widening Seaport-Airport Road, unless the Government accords sanction to develop the junction in advance, they added. Metro works On when the stretch barricaded by Kochi Metro Rail Limited will be resurfaced and opened to vehicles, sources in the metro agency said they hoped to complete developing space beneath the proposed Kakkanad metro corridor – from Collectorate Junction to Infopark Junction, by April 2022. With traffic snarls becoming common near Collectorate Junction, it has to be seen whether that portion can be opened to vehicles earlier, they said. Airport extension The RBDCK’s project to extend Seaport-Airport Road from HMT to the airport has not made much headway, due to land acquisition issues. The extension holds the key to streamlining traffic on the road and decongesting the 16-km Aroor-Edappally NH which runs parallel to it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/chaos-at-collectorate-jn-spills-over-to-approach-roads/article37745083.ece

29 November 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Biodiversity park mooted in Kochi||A proposal for creating a larger buffer area for the Mangalavanam Bird Sanctuary to restrict fresh construction activities in the region and promote free movement of birds has been mooted. The proposal forms part of the Mangalavanam eco-restoration project and the development of an urban nature reserve component of the Marine Drive extension programme. Green component A People’s Biodiversity Park will also come up as part of the green component of the development project, according to the proposal. The project mooted by the Kerala Government seeks to develop the nearly 119 hectares available in the form of islands in between the landmass from Marine Drive to Vaduthala into an ecological conservation zone. The zone will also be developed into a mangrove forest area through afforestation. Ecotourism spots will also come up as part of the programme, says the project document. An ecological conservation committee headed by an environmental expert will oversee the development and implementation of the eco-park. Scientists, environmentalists, environmental planners, and representatives of local communities will be members of the committee. The owners of land in the project area, including Kerala State Housing Board, Bharat Petroleum Corporation, Hindustan Unilever, Indian Railways and others, will also be part of the committee to create a model for the development of an ecological park. The committee shall examine developing a revenue stream to help in the upkeep and maintenance of the park besides generating revenue for the landholding agencies, it was suggested. The project report has mooted revenue generation schemes through the selling of nature and ethnic theme-based hospitality products, birdwatching trails for visitors and collection of user charges for visiting the parks. The biodiversity park will serve as a unique recreational space for the residents of the city. It can also be developed into a tourist destination. Besides sharing the revenue generated from the eco-park project, the landholders shall be compensated through alternative parcels of land, it was suggested.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/peoples-biodiversity-park-and-nature-reserve-mooted-in-city/article37745090.ece
29 November 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Adoption case: A.P. couple may retain seniority||The couple from Andhra Pradesh who had returned the baby under their foster care to its biological mother in Kerala may retain their seniority in the adoption process. The State Adoption Resource Agency is understood to have written to the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) to maintain the seniority of the couple in the adoption process. If a baby, which is given in foster care or adoption, has to be returned for no fault of the foster-care or adoptive parents, State agencies usually request the Central authorities to retain the seniority of such parents, sources privy to the process said. The parents can opt for the States from which they wish to adopt the baby. Once babies are available for legal adoption from those States, the allotment process, which is a system-generated one, will be set in motion. There is absolutely no human intervention in the process of allotting a baby. The allocation process is run in a transparent manner even while maintaining the confidentiality of the process. Allocation process One cannot predict how and when the allocation process of the baby starts, sources said. The baby of Anupama S. Chandran, who was given in foster care to the Andhra Pradesh couple, was reunited with its biological parents on November 23 after Ms. Chandran moved a court complaining that her consent for the adoption was obtained illegally. DNA test The Family Court, Thiruvananthapuram, ordered that the baby be handed over to its mother as a DNA test had confirmed that Ms. Chandran and B. Ajith Kumar were the biological parents of the baby boy. The issues related to the adoption of the baby of Ms. Chandran have come to an end and no proceedings regarding the adoption process are pending before the Family Court. Complaint The Member Secretary of the State Adoption Resource Agency too had moved the court stating that it had received a complaint from a woman, who claimed that she was the biological mother of the baby who was given in foster care. K. Biju Menon, the Family Court judge, had ordered that all the adoption proceedings shall be ‘dropped and summarily dismissed’ as the biological mother had come forward to receive the child.  The A.P. couple had in foster care the baby of Anupama S. Chandran who was later reunited with his biological parents||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/adoption-case-ap-couple-may-retain-seniority/article37744533.ece

Vaccine hesitancy is around 0.69% in the district, and the Health Department has termed it as ‘negligible’. “A section of those who had not received vaccination included people aged above 90 years, who are bedridden for long and having serious health conditions. There are many senior citizens who are unable to venture out owing to ailments and not willing to take the dose,” said M.G. Sivadas, District Nodal Officer for vaccination. “The second category includes those who have taken their first dose but are hesitant to take the second jab. They turn reluctant after contracting fever or experiencing other difficulties after receiving the first dose,” he added. Personal reasons cited On whether religious reasons were cited by some as a reason for not taking the vaccine, Health Department officials said they had not come across such a feedback. “Some had cited personal reasons for not taking the vaccine. But they have not mentioned them. We cannot force anyone to take the vaccine nor ask them to divulge the reason for not taking it. A considerable number of Ayurveda and Homoeopathy practitioners have taken both the doses,” they said. Around 78% of the target population have received the second dose. The corresponding figure in the second week of November was 66%. The district authorities have set December 31 as the deadline for covering around 90% of the target population. It will not be possible to achieve the 100% target, as people who may be tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after receiving the first dose will miss their schedule for the second dose. The vaccine is provided after three months of testing positive.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vaccine-hesitancy-in-district-negligible-says-health-dept/article37745080.ece

29 November 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Parents want special schools reopened||Parents of intellectually disabled children petitioned Education Minister V. Sivankutty and demanded the immediate reopening of 325-odd special schools in the State. They said it would go a long way towards alleviating their hardships and development challenges faced by their wards on being kept away from schools for over one-and-a-half years. The petition was recently handed over to Mr. Sivankutty under the aegis of Parents Association for the Intellectually Disabled (PAID). “Since these children need special care, at least one of the parents cannot go to work, affecting the livelihood and income of the family. Children have also turned increasingly violent and developed other behavioural issues disrupting peace at households. In fact, we are still leading a life akin to lockdown, as we continue to remain locked up in our homes with our children,” said K.M. George, State president, PAID. The petition said the reopening of special schools and hostels would enable parents to leave their wards in the care of such institutions, thus helping them restore their livelihoods. “We have to go to work to raise resources to take care of our children,” it added. Responding to a question raised on the matter in the Assembly, the Government had said that special schools would be opened once the functioning of normal schools, which were recently opened, got stabilised and its impact was assessed, since special children were more vulnerable. “An extremely difficult task awaits special school teachers, as they will have to start from zero to familiarise the children with the school atmosphere again. Gaps appeared even when children returned to school after weekends, and this time, we are talking about a break of over a year,” said PAID vice chairperson Susheela Kuriachan. Though online classes are held, they serve only a limited purpose. Besides, teachers are also under immense stress, as they work for a meagre pay. The reopening of normal schools means that siblings who used to take care of special children in the absence of parents are also no longer there. Transportation of children is likely to remain an issue when schools reopen, as most school buses have fallen into disrepair, and it needs considerable funds to turn them roadworthy again. So, parents will have to drop them at schools, said Ms. Kuriachan.  Since special children need special care, at least one of the parents cannot go to work, affecting the livelihood and income of the family K.M.

Global appeal Buoyed by the growing global appeal of the lake-side villages of Kottayam, the authorities have included the island village of Maravanthuruth along with Manchira, near Aymanam, in its upcoming STREET project for seven destinations across the State. The programme, conceived by the RT Mission Kerala, envisages establishing dedicated tourism streets by highlighting the traditional lifestyles and rural tourism potential of each region in the district. Commenting on the initiative, K. Rupesh Kumar, coordinator, RT Mission, said at least three streets of different themes would come up in each of the designated locations. The local self-governing agencies and local residents would play a major role in this process, which was envisaged as a public-private partnership project. “While the tourism resources of Manchira that forms part of the Ayamanam model RT village will be branded under the scheme, it is expected to benefit the obscure village of Maravanthuruth in a much bigger way. The island, with its well-connected canal network, interminable polder network and proximity to places likes Kochi, Alappuzha and Kottayam, has a number of local attractions and boasts of a unique cultural tradition,” he said. The place, according to him, had the potential to offer innovative experiences of experiential tourism by establishing streets for art and culture, village life experience, and agri tourism. The STREET, which is an acronym for Sustainable, Tangible, Responsible, Experiential, Ethnic, Tourism hubs, takes inspiration from the ‘Tourism for Inclusive Growth’ slogan of The United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). Life experiences According to officials, Kottayam currently has the greatest number of villages that have developed the capacity to share its life experiences to the visitors. Additionally, the Vaikom town and nine panchayats adjoining it too are being developed under a programme for People’s Participation for Planning and Empowerment through Responsible Tourism or PEPPER.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/maravanthuruth-gets-a-major-boost/article37745127.ece

Mohamed Riyas has said. Launching a comprehensive tourism development project for Beypore under the aegis of the Responsible Tourism Mission here on Sunday, the Minister said the project would result in economic development, better standard of life, and empowerment of all sections in Beypore. Mr. Riyas said Beypore was the gateway to India once and an undisputed commercial development centre of Malabar. This historical significance of the region coupled with the present day attractions is a heady mix of factors suitable for a perfect tourism destination, he added, pointing out that the tile factories, bird sanctuary, estuary, and mangrove forests, besides the Uru industry and cultural attractions would be part of it. The project was kick-started in July 2021 following which officials of the Responsible Tourism Mission were busy conducting field work and collecting data. The declaration of Beypore as a Responsible Tourism Destination will be made in July 2024. Mission State coordinator K. Roopesh Kumar, in his address, cited the expected rise in employment opportunities as the tourism potential of the region improved. “We need people to supply food, guides who can speak in the languages of visiting tourists, homestays, and memento makers to cater for tourists,” he said, adding the Mission would train interested local people in any of the allied businesses during the three years, so that they could be part of the grand scheme. He also explained the various ways the Mission planned to market Beypore. Kadalundi grama panchayat president V.S. Anusha presided over the event. Mayor Beena Philip and District Collector N. Tej Lohit Reddy were guests of honour. Basheer memorial The Minister said a memorial for writer Vaikom Muhammed Basheer would soon be a reality, with the Tourism Department joining hands with the Kozhikode Corporation for the purpose. He added that the memorial would be a key part of the Literary Tourism Circuit that the Government had announced in the Budget.

P. Rasheed Ahammed, a pro-United Democratic Front member of the Syndicate, said in a letter to Vice Chancellor M.K. Jayaraj that though 30 was the sanctioned intake in the department of Sanskrit, only five students had taken admission so far. The other departments, sanctioned intake, and admitted students are, Russian and Comparative Literature 24 (7), English 30 (17), Hindi Language and Literature 30 (15), Functional Hindi 20 (0), Malayalam 32 (20), Economics 24 (17), History 30(13), Journalism 24 (12), Philosophy 25 (19), Women’s studies 24 (16), and Folklore Studies 24 (12), he claimed. Mr. Ahammed said no more students were on the rank list in some of these departments. He alleged that the situation arose due to delay in the admission process compared to other universities. Rank list Many students who have already joined other universities and are on the rank list here are not given time to come here, Mr. Ahammed alleged. However, official sources said the delay in exam results should not be termed as a lapse. The university had conducted special exams for those who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 to ensure that no one was left out. This led to a slight delay in the launch of the PG admission process. They claimed that it was unlikely that seats would remain vacant for PG courses, and that they would be filled soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/drop-in-admissions-to-pg-seats-claims-syndicate-member/article37745053.ece

According to the Kozhikode Corporation authorities, the facility will be thrown open after purchasing some essential furniture and the repositioning of some of the nearby bunk shops. There will be all required amenities to ensure the stay of 125 persons at a time in the spacious building, they add. “Though the facility was inaugurated last year, the pandemic situation affected its functioning along with other technical issues. The unexpected delay in procuring some furniture items for rooms also caused the delay,” says S.K. Aboobacker, councillor from Valiyangadi division. He also points out that the corporation is yet to finalise a suitable agency that can manage the functioning of the facility. The unavailability of cost-effective short-stay homes has been a matter of concern for women who reach the city from nearby districts. One of the main attractions of the ‘She lodge’ was its proximity to the police station and the Kozhikode railway station. With the delay in opening, many women in need of short-stay facilities were depending on the service of paying guest service providers at a higher cost. Corporation officials said the building was completed at a cost of Rs. 4.7 crore under people’s planning projects. “The facility on a 28-cent plot has good dormitories, individual rooms, Wi-Fi connectivity, comfort station facilities and 24x7 security surveillance,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/measures-under-way-to-reopen-she-lodge/article37745067.ece

Leaders of Kerala Home Guards Welfare Association say guards are now getting Rs. 780 a day which is not an adequate remuneration considering the eight hours of duty and the strenuous nature of work under many police stations. The lack of any other major allowances, leave benefits, insurance support and other treatment aid prompts many to support the call for a better daily wage that can help them survive the impact of the inflation. Many of them continue in the field because of their passion for service after retiring from the armed forces. The remuneration is yet to match the actual skills and work experience of the guards and many manage living expenses by clubbing it with their pension amount. “There are retired honorary captains and subedar majors with long years of experience who work with the police and fire service in various humble roles here. They turn up for the demanding job mainly to keep themselves engaged and do whatever service possible to the uniformed forces. We feel that they can be honoured with a better wage equal to that of a civil police officer,” a functionary of the Kerala Home Guards Welfare Association said. He also made it clear that no guard would resort to any street protest or demonstration to win the cause as they all wanted the revision as a token of appreciation from the government. The association functionaries said they had already submitted their pleas to all the higher authorities concerned for a favourable action at the earliest. If approved, nearly 3,000 home guards, including women, would get its direct benefits and perform better in their service, they pointed out. In Kozhikode district, the police have been mostly employing home guards for traffic-related duties. Considering the strenuous nature of the job, the working hours for those on traffic duty is six hours. On completion of three-hour duty, they are given three hours rest time before resuming the second shift at the assigned spot. For others, eight hours’ duty is mandatory to get the full daily wage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/home-guards-in-kozhikode-demand-wage-revision/article37745058.ece

Opening the valedictory event of an academic conference on the 1921 Malabar rebellion here on Sunday evening, he said there was nothing new in saying that Muslims eat only ‘halal food’. Muslims should not eat the meat of animals or birds that are strangled or beaten to death. Some hotels display boards saying they serve only ‘halal food’. This is to highlight that the meat they use is properly slaughtered. Many non-Muslims work in hotels owned by Muslims. Everyone knows that there is no peculiar way of cooking in these places. “Many erstwhile Muslim leaders were part of our Independence movement.

29 November 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Refund fee if marks increase: panel||Any increase in marks following revaluation makes students eligible to get back the fee remitted for revaluation, the Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights has said. At present, students are returned the revaluation fee only if there is an increase of more than 10% in the marks. The commission of member K. Nazeer on Friday directed that necessary changes be made to the examination manual in this regard. Acting on a petition from a Plus Two student from Nalanchira here, the commission said the return of the fee could not be denied on the grounds that the mark difference following revaluation was not more than 10%. The student had secured four ‘A+’ and two ‘A’ grades in the Plus One examinations. The A grades were in Hindi and English. She submitted a fee of Rs. 500 for revaluation and Rs. 300 for a copy of the answer sheet. While her marks in English remained unchanged, her marks in Hindi increased from 80 to 95. The Joint Director (Examinations) in the Higher Secondary Directorate, in a report to the commission, submitted that revaluation fee was returned to a student if the increase in marks was more than 10%. The official said that if no fee were to be charged for revaluation, it would lead to widespread misuse of the provision. Stand of the applicants The commission observed that students submitted applications for revaluation because they felt they deserved more marks and felt the evaluation was not done properly. Any increase in marks following revaluation affirmed their contention. In such cases, no provision could be made that the revaluation fee would be returned only if the additional mark gain was above 10%. It was a violation of child rights, the commission said, directing that the fee should be given back to students even if the mark hike was minimal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/refund-revaluation-fee-if-marks-increase-panel/article37745068.ece

Complaints The agency or the authorities have failed to clear the accumulated waste even after several months, despite complaints from residents. The waste dump has become such an acute problem for the residents that they have formed the Maruthoorkadavu Aerobin Action Council to raise the issue forcefully at multiple forums. According to the residents here, the decentralised waste processing centre used to be fairly managed earlier, with regular upkeep of the aerobic bins. The control of the centre was handed over to a private agency some months back. The civic body has been using the services of various NGOs and agencies for local-level collection of waste from house and processing, with some of them doing commendable work on the ground. However, at Maruthoorkadavu, the centre soon turned into a collection point for biodegradable and non biodegradable waste, some of which were not even segregated properly. From other places “The agency which was given the responsibility of waste management in four wards began bringing in waste from other places too. The non-biodegradable waste which was collected here was supposed to be transported to other locations for recycling, but despite several requests they never took it away. There is so much stench and the water from it seeps into the ground, and all of it is causing a lot of trouble to the residents as well as passers-by,” says Kalady Sreekumar, Convenor of the action council. Following complaints from the residents, the Corporation took back control of the collection centre recently, but the waste dump still remains, although the sanitation workers revived the aerobic bins, which were used by the agency to dump waste. Three other wards The agency still handles waste management in three other wards. The action council has now complained to the Mayor, the State Pollution Control Board and the Suchitwa Mission, requesting that the waste dump be cleared at the earliest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/protest-over-waste-dump-at-maruthoorkadavu/article37745129.ece

The Medical College police identified the accused as Mujeeb Rahman, 43, of Kowdiar. The accused, who runs the firm Riya Travel Solutions at Pattom, is suspected to have duped several job-seekers who aspired to migrate overseas. He has been apprehended on the basis of a complaint by Nettayam native Sreelakshmi who had paid him Rs. 4 lakh after being assured of a job visa in Canada. Having managed to win her trust, he purportedly collected Rs. 5.5 lakh from the complainant’s relatives whom he promised to get family visas. He got hold of 10 passports from them after convincing them that they were required to process the visas. Soon after nabbing him, the police recovered numerous passports and other documents from his house in Golf Links, Kowdiar. While the accused has been remanded to judicial custody, the police intended to seek his custody to identify more victims who could have fallen prey to similar fraudulent activities, the police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/one-held-for-visa-fraud/article37745133.ece

This is not a virus which will stabilise and mutations will keep happening and it certainly does not warrant panic every time a new mutation is detected. While it is not yet known whether the effect of vaccination might be lower against the new variant, vaccination can still protect against serious disease,” a member of the State-level expert committee on COVID-19 said. According to information in the public domain, courtesy IGIB, the six variants spanning the spike receptor binding domain of the B.1.1.529 lineage has been found to be resistant to several monoclonal antibodies, including its cocktails, some of which are widely in therapeutic use currently. Angelique Coetzee, the chairwoman of the South African Medical Association, was quoted in a BBC interview on Saturday that “the new Omicron variant of the Coronavirus results in mild disease, without prominent symptoms, apart from sore muscles, mild fatigue and slight cough.” According to a recent study in NEJM (Severity of SARS CoV2 re-infections as compared with primary infections, November 24), COVID-19 re-infections had 90% lower odds of resulting in hospitalisation or death than primary infections. Re-infections, the study said, were rare and mild perhaps because of the primed immune system after primary infection. Overly concerned Clinicians said that this was yet another reassurance that one should not be overly concerned about new variants of the virus, even if it causes re-infections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-to-speed-up-second-dose/article37745263.ece
29 November 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Unvaccinated teachers: Govt. toughens stand||The State Government has toughened its stand against teaching and non-teaching staff in schools who are yet to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Nearly 5,000 teaching and non-teaching staff in the State are estimated to be unvaccinated though schools reopened on November 1. Minister for General Education V. Sivankutty told The Hindu that teachers were role models and the Government took a serious view of their refusal to get vaccinated as it affected society as a whole. “There are around 1.6 lakh schoolteachers in the State. A minority among them are yet to take their vaccines. This cannot be accepted. Vaccination is especially important as the Government is considering resuming full-fledged classes in schools in a week or two and in view of the concerns over the emerging new COVID-19 variant. We need to be extremely vigilant.” “Children’s safety is our priority,” he said. The Minister, who made a fresh plea to teachers to get vaccinated in the interests of public safety, hinted at strict action. Awareness Teachers’ forums called for creating more awareness among teachers of the need to get vaccinated. Kerala School Teachers Association general secretary N.T. Sivarajan said the union felt that sensitising teachers to the social need would work better than disciplinary action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/unvaccinated-teachers-govt-toughens-stand/article37745101.ece

Petition The commission of member K. Nazeer was acting on a petition by a resident of Nedumudi in Alappuzha panchayat. The petitioner alleged that a tuition centre named Phoenix that was located near Poopalli junction in Nedumudi panchayat was conducting online classes during April-May in the 2020-21 academic year which the government had declared as summer vacation. Aided teacher The tuition centre was run by an aided school teacher and his kin, and many other government and aided schoolteachers took classes there. The centre was not registered with the panchayat. The panchayat secretary, in a report to the commission, said the tuition centre was functioning without the panchayat’s permission. In the 2020-21 academic year, in the wake of COVID-19 protocols, no tuition centres were given permission to function, and Phoenix conducted only online classes during this time. The centre principal also attested that only online classes were held, and no COVID-19 guidelines were violated. The commission, which did not pass a specific order in the case, said that as per Section 28 of the Right to Education Act, no teacher shall engage in private tuition or private teaching activity. Prevented Involvement in any such activity should be prevented strictly in the State, the panel said, directing the General Education Secretary and the Director of General Education to pass orders in this regard.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/teachers-should-not-take-private-tuitions-panel/article37745128.ece

Shivakumar on Sunday urged Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai to take a delegation of MPs from the State to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to register protest. “Kannadigas are shocked and severely hurt to know that there are plans to shift the prestigious programme to Gujarat. If it happens, Kannadigas will feel that the federal government is ignoring, betraying, and giving scant respect to the feeling of locals,” Mr. Shivakumar said in a letter to Mr. Bommai, which was released to the media on Sunday. He pointed out: “Already there is outrage over the stepmotherly treatment being meted out to Karnataka by the Centre in several spheres. The move will cause adverse effects on consolidation of the federal system in the country.” The KPCC president has also written to the Prime Minister, urging him to drop the proposal. Launched in 2007 by ISRO, the Indian Human Space Flight programme is to develop technology needed to launch crewed orbital spacecraft into low earth orbit. Mr. Shivakumar said: “If it is completed, India will become the fourth nation in the world to launch independent space flight. People of Karnataka are very proud of this programme.” The KPCC president urged the Chief Minister to use his good offices to explain this to the Prime Minister. “Ensure that the proposal to shift the programme from Karnataka is dropped by the Centre and the self respect of Kannadigas is upheld,” said the letter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/drop-proposal-to-shift-human-space-flight-programme-out-of-state-dks/article37744530.ece

The Chief Minister also indicated the possibility of restrictions being imposed in the light of new developments. Stating that the number of COVID-19 tests will be increased in the State, he said, “We are watching the developments in the State after clusters developed in Dharwad, Bengaluru, and Mysuru.” Blaming the sudden increase in these places on paramedics and students travelling from Kerala, Mr. Bommai said: “Vigil in Dakshina Kannada, Mysuru, Chamarajanagar, and Madikeri that border Kerala has been increased. Tests have been increased and travellers are being allowed only after tests.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/impose-ban-on-travellers-from-omicron-hit-countries/article37744528.ece
29 November 2021||CHENNAI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Heavy rain may shift to south Tamil Nadu today||After pummelling the north coastal areas, the heavy rain may shift to south Tamil Nadu on Monday. The intense rain may take a break from November 30 and decrease gradually. The cyclonic circulation over the Comorin area and the adjoining Sri Lanka coast in the lower level may move and emerge in the Arabian Sea by Monday. Officials of the India Meteorological Department said that while the easterlies over the coastal areas would push moisture into the land, the moving weather system would bring in south-westerly winds. Some parts of south coastal Tami Nadu, such as Kanniyakumari, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi and Ramanathapuram, are likely to receive heavy to very heavy rain on Monday, owing to the wind convergence. Most other parts of the coastal region, including Chennai, may receive moderate rain. On Sunday, rain lashed several coastal districts. Puducherry, Kalavai in Ranipet district and Cuddalore recorded 7 cm from 8.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. More areas of Chennai went under water as rain pounded the city. Meenambakkam recorded 6 cm, West Tambaram 4 cm, Ennore, Villivakkam, Taramani, Chembarambakkam, Sathyabama University and MRC Nagar 2 cm each, and Nungambakkam 1 cm. In the past 24 hours ending 8.30 a.m. on Sunday, Pamban and Mandapam in Ramanathapuram district and Mamallapuram received a very heavy rainfall of 11 cm each. Schools and colleges in many districts, including Puducherry, Karaikal, Thoothukudi and Tiruvallur, have declared a holiday for Monday. IMD officials said the intensity of the rain might drop from Monday and most places in the southern as well as northern parts might receive light to moderate rain. The low pressure area that is likely to form over the south Andaman Sea may not have an impact on Tamil Nadu, said N. Puviarasan, director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre. Tamil Nadu received 61.2 cm of rainfall, 76% more than its seasonal average, till Sunday. Most of the districts, except Madurai and Virudhunagar, have received either excess or largely excess rainfall. They were among the localities that recorded a significant amount of rainfall till 5.30 p.m. In the past 24 hours ending 8.30 a.m. on Sunday, Pamban and Mandapam in Ramanathapuram district and Mamallapuram received a very heavy rainfall of 11 cm each.

29 November 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Heavy rain in Chittoor district, reservoirs under surveillance||The eastern mandals of Satyavedu, BN Kandriga, and Varadaiahpalem received a downpour on Sunday, while the rest of Chittoor district also witnessed moderate spell of rain, followed by drizzling. Rainfall was registered in all 66 mandals in the district, which recorded 653.4 mm rainfall in total. While the highest rainfall was recorded at Satyavedu(57mm), the lowest was recorded in Baireddipalle mandal(0.8mm). Heavy rainfall alert for the next two days prompted District Collector M. Hari Narayanan to visit the Araniyar project near Pitchatur and the Kalangi dam in KVB Puram as a precautionary measure. It may be remembered that Kalangi dam’s crest gates were washed away in November 2015 when the Roanu cyclone had wreaked havoc in Chittoor district. The Collector instructed the irrigation, revenue and police officials to monitor the water levels in the two reservoirs by deploying field staff in shifts and initiating steps to discharge the floodwaters downstream. As a precautionary measure, people in villages downstream of Aruna river were asked to stay away from the river bed and were cautioned against crossing the causeways. Superintending Engineer (Irrigation) Vijay Kumar Reddy told The Hindu that of the 7,500 tanks in Chittoor district, nearly 80% of them had reached cent percent water levels. Total damages “Damage was reported in 550 areas, including breaches and washing away of bunds. An estimated amount of Rs. 170 crore for permanent repairs and Rs. 10 crore for temporary works are required. All the reservoirs are under constant surveillance,” the official said. In Chittoor, Municipal Commissioner P. Viswanath visited the localities along the Neeva river and sought the field staff to be alert in the coming two days. In Madanapalle, the Bahuda river that showed its fury on November 13 had turned placid in the last two days. The municipal officials said that floods to the Bahuda river would depend on the inflows from the upper reaches in Karnataka. Following a fresh rain alert, police teams were posted at causeways vulnerable to overflowing in the division. In Kuppam, it was a heavy drizzle on Sunday afternoon. Forest Range Officer (Satyavedu) J. Prasada Rao said that due to a downpour in the area from Saturday night, the public was prevented from moving towards the waterfalls in the forest areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/heavy-rain-in-chittoor-district-reservoirs-under-surveillance/article37745201.ece
29 November 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Traffic on highway hit as village tank breaches||Vehicular traffic on the busy Chittoor-Chennai-Vellore National Highway was affected after the Kothapalle Cheruvu breached on Sunday night. As a result, the prime routes towards Chennai, Vellore and Tirupati were chock-a-block with vehicles for up to four km. Over 1,000 vehicles were stranded on three roads connected to the junction. Chittoor and Gudipala mandals received heavy rains in the last two weeks. Deputy SP (Law and Order) N. Sudhakar Reddy said that the village tank by the side of the highway breached at around 7 p.m.. It was hardly noticed by the motorists on the highway as they mistook it for some regular water flow on the roads due to rains. Soon, the water level on the highway went up to four feet, forcing the traffic to come to a halt. Police personnel from Chittoor and Gudipala station rushed to the spot and tried to streamline the traffic. Four earthmovers were deployed to divert the flood waters. As the water from the breached tank started receding after 9 p.m., heavy vehicles were allowed to move on the highway, while cars and two-wheelers were temporarily barred from entering the zone, said Mr. Sudhakar Reddy. “We will restore complete order by midnight,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/traffic-on-highway-hit-as-village-tank-breaches/article37745288.ece
29 November 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Fear of viral fevers grips rain-battered Chittoor||Fear has gripped people in Chittoor district where incessant rain since early November has rendered many areas vulnerable to the threat of viral fevers and diarrhoea. Last month, diarrhoea broke out in Renigunta and Vadamalapeta mandals, where over 70 cases were reported, which included two casualties. District Medical and Health Officer (DM&HO) U. Sree Hari told The Hindu that the medical and health administration had been keeping a watch on areas where water-logging took place. Awareness camps The official said the threat of viral fevers or mosquito-borne diseases is low when it is raining. “But, the problem arises when the rain stops. The stagnant water from the fresh pools slowly leads to the breeding of mosquitoes responsible for dengue. We have initiated steps for clearing the stagnant water in all rural areas and municipalities,” he said. Deputy DM&HO P. Ravi Raju said that awareness camps on the steps needed to keep the viral fevers at bay were conducted in the eastern mandals, covering the Nagari and Puttur municipalities in the first phase. ‘Drink boiled water’ “As the Chittoor district had witnessed heavy rain for a month, we advise people to boil the water before drinking. Every day, we are alerting the field staff through virtual meetings to intensify surveillance on viral fevers in rural areas,” he said. The district officials are focussing on Varadaiahpalem and KVB Puram mandals, with its history of dengue outbreak twice between 2016 and 2018, leading to over 50 casualties.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/fear-of-viral-fevers-grips-rain-battered-chittoor/article37745203.ece
29 November 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Guntur surgeon’s platelet enrichment kit gets patent||An orthopaedic surgeon, Amarnath Surat, has been granted a patent for inventing a regenerative medical treatment in treating chronic osteoarthritis and sports injuries related to joints using Platelet Rich Plasma — a recent advance in regenerative medicine. Dr. Amarnath ’s innovation, titled ‘Apparatus and a Closed Extraction System for Platelet-Rich Plasma’, has been granted a patent certificate from the Intellectual Property India, a Government of India office authorised to issue patents, designs, trademarks and Geographical Indications. The treatment uses platelet-rich plasma extracted from whole blood, centrifuged to remove red blood cells and leukocytes. The platelets with concentrated growth factors are used to stimulate growth of cartilage at the desired site of joint inflammation. The platelet enrichment kit is useful for patients with acute knee joint pains, tennis elbow, osteoarthritis and diabetic foot and ulcers. The PRP extraction kit costing Rs. 2,000 has been developed by Regen Technologies. The procedure begins with drawing blood from the patients, from which the PRP is extracted and then injected into the affected part to regenerate damaged tissue. “The human body has a capacity to heal itself. The stem cells extracted from bone marrow are formed into Bone Marrow Aspirate Concentrate — a densily centrifuged autologous plasma — which is injected into the affected area in the body. In designing the PRP kit, we have kept safety in mind. The treatment is now being used to treat sports injuries as well,” Dr. Amarnath told The Hindu on Saturday. Counselling process Patients would be taken through counselling procedures before and during treatment. Lifestyle modifications during the treatment include weight loss, performing low intensity exercises and keeping sugar levels under control.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/guntur-surgeons-platelet-enrichment-kit-gets-patent/article37744710.ece
29 November 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||KCR to take the battle over paddy to Delhi||Chief Minister and TRS president K. Chandrasekhar Rao has asked the party MPs to organise a dharna in front of Parliament House in New Delhi in a day or two in protest against the refusal of the Centre to buy paddy produced in the State in the current rabi. He gave the instructions while addressing the Parliamentary party meeting of TRS on the eve of commencement of the winter session of Parliament on Monday. All the MPs of TRS of both Houses were asked to participate in the protest, sources said. A release later said the meeting expressed its resentment over the failure of the Centre to break the stalemate even after a delegation of Ministers from the State met Union Food and PDS Minister Piyush Goyal and officials led by Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar discussed the matter with officials in the Ministry. Annual calender The meeting also deplored the irrational attitude of the Centre in refusing to lift paddy in rabi and yet keeping the issue live by acknowledging Mr. Rao’s proposal for release of an annual calender on foodgrains procurement at the national level, but not fixing the target of procurement in the State. Therefore, it was decided to launch a struggle against the Centre-sponsored chaos which was a catastrophe for farming community of Telangana, though it was a role model for the country in terms of steep increase in agricultural yields within a short span of time. In this background, Mr. Rao asked the MPs to raise the voice of the farming community by confronting the Centre on the crisis using Parliament as a platform. The BJP should shed its double standards on procurement policy, he added. Mr. Rao also criticised the Centre for touching off the State government by offering to purchase only 60 lakh tonnes of paddy as against the projected 90 lakh tonnes in the recent kharif. This should be stoutly resisted by TRS MPs in both Houses. He also asked the MPs to raise the demand for a uniform national foodgrains procurement policy in Parliament to provide a level playing field for all States. The meeting was attended by Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar and other senior officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/stage-dharna-in-front-of-parliament-kcr/article37744532.ece
29 November 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Engg. classes to begin from Dec.1||Engineering colleges have been directed to begin academic activity from December 1, with COVID-19 precautionary measures in place apart from taking steps to tackle emotional issues of students coming into campuses after a two-year gap due to the pandemic. Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE) chairman, R. Limbadri said colleges have to ensure that their entire staff is vaccinated before welcoming students into classes while universities must organise special camps to administer doses to students who are yet to take the jab. “There should be no room for complacency in this aspect,” he said. Prof. Limbadri said colleges are being instructed to open nodal centres on their campuses with counsellors from the teaching or non-teaching wings who have to keep in touch with the local medical officer to constantly guide the students. “These young students are emotionally vulnerable and their exposure to campus life should be smooth. The counsellors have to guide them,” he said. Anti-ragging committees have to be formed immediately as per existing norms as the TSCHE will take violations seriously, he said. Colleges will be made responsible for any ragging incident. Blended academics plan Given the fears of new variants of the coronavirus emerging, he said colleges also have to be ready with a blended academic plan to make it easy for the students to adopt, if the need arises. Teachers have to be prepared and the necessary environment has to be created. “The University Grants Commission has allowed blended learning up to 40% of offline classes, and colleges have the liberty to adopt it the way it suits them,” he added. Seat vacancy Meanwhile, the admission process in engineering colleges has almost been completed, including the special round of allotments. After the completion of counselling process, 22,679 seats remained vacant out of the total 79,856 in engineering stream under convenor quota. Similarly, in pharmacy, 4,203 out of the 4,426 seats went unfilled. Officials said 726 seats remained vacant in the university colleges and mostly these were in the newly-established JNTU College in Sircilla. Few takers There were few takers in the colleges under Kakatiya University. Nine colleges, including one private college and eight university colleges, saw 100% seats filled up. One college went without a single admission. In the sought-after computer science engineering stream, 1,505 seats remained vacant out of the 19,101 available in the convenor quota. Other courses like electronics and communication engineering saw 3,626 seats going vacant while 4,151 seats were vacant in electrical and electronics engineering.  There should be no room for complacency with regard to vaccination. R.

29 November 2021||JAGGAMPETA (EAST GODAVARI),ANDHRA PRADESH||‘YSRCP has brought State close to bankruptcy’||Jana Sena Party Affairs Committee (PAC) chairman Nadendla Manohar on Sunday lamented that the YSRCP government and its welfare policies would push the State into bankruptcy. Mr. Manohar on Sunday began his three-day visit to East Godavari district as part of strengthening the party cadre in all the Assembly segments and road repair campaign. Addressing the party cadre and members of the Konaseema region, Mr. Manohar said the policies of the Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy had brought the State close to bankruptcy. “Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy failed to understand the magnitude of loss during the floods and granted barely Rs. 2 crore for his home district of Kadapa. If it goes like this, we will soon have a crisis of able leadership to run the state of affairs,” said Mr. Manohar. He appealed to the party cadres to launch a field-level campaign to expose the YSRCP government’s policies and enlighten the people on the ‘failure of the State government’. “The development of the State has come to a standstill. There is no policy for the development of infrastructure or attracting investment. These failures should be exposed,” he said. In Kakinada, Mr. Manohar took part in a ‘Sramadanam’ programme to repair the ADB-Achampeta road as part of the campaign. Mr. Manohar handed over a cheque for Rs. 5 lakh to each family of Kondapalli Venkateswarlu (Jaggampeta) and Mummidi Rajesh (Panduru village), who died in the road mishaps recently. The victims were active JSP members who were entitled for the ex gratia as part of the party’s insurance scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-has-brought-state-close-to-bankruptcy/article37745219.ece
29 November 2021||KAKINADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Godavari water likely to be diverted to delta for rabi crops||The Irrigation Advisory Board (IAB-East Godavari) has proposed to stop supply of water to all the minor and medium irrigation projects from December 1 and divert the same to the Godavari delta for the 2021-22 rabi season. The move would facilitate opening all the canals of fed by the Godavari to provide irrigation water in the delta. The canals will remain open till March 31 across the delta to allow the farmers to go for the 90-day duration crops in the rabi season. For the next kharif, the canals will be opened in June. The total water requirement of the Godavari delta for irrigation and drinking purposes is 90.22 tmcft. However, the delta has barely 61.76 tmcft of water in all the sources including the Godavari at the Polavaram irrigation project. The extent of area under cultivation in the rabi season is 8.96 lakh acres in the Godavari’s eastern, central, and western deltas spread in the twin Godavari districts. “An estimated 2.70 lakh acres are unlikely to get it in the rabi season. So it has been proposed to provide the same for up to 74.41% of the Godavari delta,” said B. Rambabu, Superintendent Engineer, Dowleswaram Irrigation Circle. Lift irrigation schemes The supply of water will be stopped to all the lift irrigation schemes (LIS) upstream Polavaram project on the banks of the Godavari. It is not advised to go for rabi crops in the areas under the purview of Torrigedda and Chagalnadu lift irrigation schemes. There would also be no supply of water to the LISes being operated by the Andhra Pradesh State Irrigation Development Corporation and Tuni Irrigation Circle limits in the non-delta zone for the rabi. However, the crops will be allowed within the command area of the medium irrigation projects—Pampa, Maddigedda, and Subbareddy Sagar —only based on the availability of the water in these projects. The Dowleswaram Irrigation Circle authorities have made it clear that there would be no possibility to supply irrigation water from the sources in the command area of the projects – Musurumilli, Bhoopathinapalem, and Soorampalem. These projects fall in the Polavaram Left Main Canal area and Tuni irrigation circle. IAB meet today Meanwhile, all eyes are on the IAB meeting scheduled to be held in Kakinada on Monday. East Godavari Collector Ch. Hari Kiran, who is also the chaiman of IAB, people’s representatives and other stakeholders would attend the meet to prepare the rabi action plan to utilise the available water resources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/godavari-water-likely-to-be-diverted-to-delta-for-rabi-crops/article37745205.ece

A native of Gonduru in the cut-off area in V.R. Puram mandal, Sandala Jayasudha of the Konda Reddy tribe was expected to deliver her baby in December. However, she complained of labour pains in the early hours of Sunday. “I received a phone call from the habitation seeking medical assistance for Ms. Jayasudha. A boat was arranged to help her cross the Godavari. But she delivered a baby girl before the boat could reach her place,” ITDA Project Officer A. Venkata Ramana told The Hindu . Later, Ms. Jayasudha and the baby were brought to the Pocharam bank of the Godavari, where the ‘108’ ambulance staff arrived to receive her. The staff members, Srinivas and Mani Swaroop, immediately drove the woman and her baby to the nearest Primary Health Centre (PHC) at Kothulagutta. “The health condition of the woman and the baby is good,” said Mr. Venkata Ramana. The residents thanked the government officials for their timely initiative.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/itda-chintoor-reaches-out-to-woman-just-born-baby/article37745204.ece
29 November 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Alencherry calls for unity and peace within church||Major Archbishop Cardinal George Alencherry, head of the Syro-Malabar Church, called for prayers for unity and peace within the Church, as a unified system of celebration of the Mass was inaugurated on Sunday according to a decision by the synod of bishops in August this year. Leading the Sunday Mass at St. Thomas Mount in Kakkanad, headquarters of the Syro-Malabar Church, Cardinal Alencherry said the Church desired total unity and peace and said God would not abandon his people and the faithful had to wait with hope and prayers. There was no need for fear as voices differ, he said during the Sunday homily. Under focus The way the Mass is celebrated in the Syro-Malabar Church has come under focus since August with the synod of bishops deciding to implement a unified system in which the celebrant faced the congregation during the first half of the Mass and faced away from the congregation during most of the rest of the Mass. In keeping with the synodal decision, the Cardinal and the co-celebrants faced the congregation during the first half of the Mass on Sunday and turned away from the congregation after the recital of the Credo, before the consecration. While the unified Mass system was inaugurated, almost all the 431 parishes and around 90 religious houses in the Ernakulam-Angamaly Major Archdiocese celebrated the Mass with the celebrant facing the congregation throughout the Mass after the Congregation for Oriental Churches in Rome intervened to maintain status quo. It is learnt that only one parish in the archdiocese celebrated the Mass under the unified system. Status quo A letter from the congregation addressed to Archbishop Antony Kariyil, Metropolitan Vicar of the Archdiocese, said as Metropolitan Vicar, the archbishop could dispense with any decision to have a unified Mass system. The other dioceses too, it is learnt, had been issued sanction to continue with the status quo. Cardinal Alencherry had said on Saturday that he had not received any communication from Rome regarding exemption. The synodal decision has caused unrest among the priests, religious and lay people in the dioceses where the Mass is now celebrated with the celebrant facing the congregation throughout the ceremony.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/alencherry-calls-for-unity-and-peace-within-church/article37744535.ece
29 November 2021||KURNOOL,ANDHRA PRADESH||Women prevent officials from opening wine shop||Women gathered in large numbers and prevented the Excise officials from inaugurating a wine shop on the Ullal Road in the 36th ward here on Sunday. Though the officials tried to convince them, the women stood their ground and asked the officials to shift the shop. The officials reportedly brought the stocks late in the night on Saturday and thought of inaugurating the wine shop in the new shopping complex located on the road, in the vicinity of which there were three major schools. Getting a wind of it, women of the locality gathered in large numbers and opposed the plan to set up a wine shop there as they were apprehensive that it would pose a security threat to the women who pass by that route to either drop their children at school or pick them up after school hours. “Fearing uncivilised behaviour of the drunken lot, the women of the locality informed us about the proposed opening of the wine shop. Members of the All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA) have supported the women in their agitation,” said association district leader P. Nirmala. Excise Circle Inspector Padmavathi tried to buy time by asked the agitating women to allow the shop to function for a few days before it could be shifted, but none agreed to the proposal. “The AIDWA will keep a watch on the shop. If the Excise Department tries to surreptitiously open the wine shop at that place, members of the association will raid it,” said its district secretary A. Alivelu and CPI(M) leader Jamunamma. The IV Town police personnel too came to the spot, but the AIDWA leaders talked to the complex owner, Brahmaiah, and requested him to cancel his contract with the Excise Department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/women-prevent-officials-from-opening-wine-shop/article37745217.ece
29 November 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||HIV patients live in constant fear as third wave looms||With the detection of a new highly-transmissible coronavirus variant, ‘Omicron’ in South Africa and the threat of a third wave of the pandemic becoming bigger, HIV patients in Prakasam are in jitters. Their fear is reasonable, as of the total 41,423 persons living with HIV(human immunodeficiency virus) in the district, only less than 3,500 persons had received both doses of vaccine while around 12,000 persons are fully vaccinated. During the first wave of the pandemic, 170 HIV patients tested positive and ten of them succumbed to the virus. Most of them hailed from mandals where there was no target intervention, according to District AIDS Control Society sources. Their compromised immune system makes them more vulnerable to infections, and more so the reason why vaccination against COVID for them is important. Special medical camps should be organised for them at the level of public health centres, says HELP, an NGO, director N.V.S. Rammohan. He adds that the District AIDS Control and Prevention Committee under the District Collector should be activated and schemes for patients’ socio-economic uplift should be taken up on top priority. ‘Many yet to receive pension’ Nutritious food, too, remains a distant dream for most of them, especially in non-target intervention areas in the district. A majority of the persons, who had tested positive for HIV, lacked nutritional support. On a side note, of more than 8,800 infected persons who had applied for pension, only little over 2,200 of them got Rs. 2,000 as pension, according an NGO, working among the high risk group. During the first wave of the pandemic, Premalatha (name changed) from Korisapadu village in Prakasam district had faced a lot of difficulty in getting HIV medicines. But fortunately for her, the Andhra Pradesh State AIDS Control Society(APSACS) supplied the antiretroviral (ARV) medicines at her residence. To avoid such hassles in the event of a third wave, ARV drugs should be made available at the level of PHC, experts say. ‘HIV positivity rate coming down’ Meanwhile, District Aids Prevention and Control Unit(DAPCU) Manager T. Ranga Rao says that HIV positive rate has come down from last year’s 1.26% to 0.89% during April and October 2021 when over 1.06 lakh people were tested including over 45,000 pregnant women. As many as 659 had tested positive for HIV. “We have stepped up awareness programmes in the high risk mandals by roping in Burakatha artistes to highlight the safe practices,” he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hiv-patients-live-in-constant-fear-as-third-wave-looms/article37744713.ece

29 November 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||COVID-19: ‘no room for complacency in Kerala’||The anxiety expressed by the Centre that the lack of sustained COVID-19 testing levels across States would “hide the true level of infection in a geography” seems to be justified now that a new SARS CoV-2 variant, B.1.1.529 or Omicron, has been reported from many nations. With the waning of the second wave of COVID-19, a sense of complacency had set in everywhere. COVID-19 testing rates, which had dropped everywhere, might be back in relevance now that the vigil is being heightened to look out for the new variant. From an average 1.3-1.5 lakh tests daily during the thick of the pandemic, the State’s testing had dwindled to about 50,000 tests. The Union Health Secretary had on November 23 written to 13 States highlighting the need for continued vigil given the unpredictable and contagious nature of the disease. Uncertain course “Unpredictable is the key word there. There is no room for complacency as the future course of the pandemic is still uncertain. Even when the State believes that it can vaccinate its way out of the pandemic, the heterogeneous nature of the immunity against COVID-19 in the State’s population means that we cannot be certain whether the next variant will result in a wave or not,” a senior public health expert said. The Centre has directed Kerala and many other States to maintain a high level of testing so that the actual level of infection and any trends are not missed. Senior health officials maintained that while the State had not given any formal direction, testing levels had gone down because the resources available with districts had dwindled. Hence the RT-PCR labs in public sector could handle only a limited number of samples a day. Of the 20,000-strong COVID brigade, the State has retained only 625 personnel. A good proportion of the tests done now are contributed by the private sector. “Symptomatic illnesses like ILI are still being tested and tracked. However, the free mobile testing labs have been stopped and after the disbanding of the COVID-19 brigade, all districts are struggling to find human resources to carry out COVID-related activities. Also antigen tests, which used to be done in large numbers, are not done any more at that scale,” a Health official said. Home testing Now that ICMR-approved home testing kits are easily available, many do self testing and go to hospital only if symptoms do not subside. These case numbers will not figure in the State’s records. “It is true that entire families, where all adults are fully vaccinated, are getting infected now. In most offices too, small clusters can be found. But people are not scared. Vaccinated persons with mild symptoms avoid testing, leading to greater transmission. Though hospitalisations have come down, daily deaths have not come down as expected. But the arrival of the new variant can complicate this,” he added.  Vaccinated persons with mild symptoms avoid testing, leading to greater transmission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/covid-19-no-room-for-complacency-in-kerala/article37744525.ece

29 November 2021||Thrissur,ANDHRA PRADESH||57 norovirus cases confirmed in Thrissur||Norovirus infection has been confirmed in 57 people, including 54 students and three workers, in the hostel of St. Mary’s College, Thrissur. Health officials suspect that the infection might have spread through food or drinking water distributed in the hostel. At present, there are 240 students and 15 workers in the hostel. A team of health officials led by the district medical officer (DMO) N.K. Kuttappan examined the hostel and surroundings, the kitchen and drinking water supply. Students have been complaining about symptoms such as diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea and fever from November 8, according to the college authorities. But nobody suspected it as norovirus infection. Eight students went for treatment at the Thrissur General Hospital on November 24. Their blood, faeces and urine samples were tested for bacteria and virus. Norovirus infection was confirmed in the tests done at the virology laboratory in Alappuzha. The health team conducted an awareness programme for students and workers of the college and gave instruction for taking preventive measures. The Health Department has taken sufficient precautions to check the spread of the infection, the DMO said. The college authorities have been asked not to send students to their homes until the virus infection is totally cured. It is suspected that some of the students, who had symptoms earlier had gone to their houses. The Health Department has asked the hostel authorities to alert them. No need for panic Health officials told the people not to panic. As it is a virus that can spread from human beings to other human beings, people should be careful, they said. People have been asked to drink only boiled water. Hands should be washed properly after using the washroom. Vegetables and fruits should be washed properly before using, do not share food or vessels. The DMO has asked the medical team to monitor hostels, old age homes and migrant labour camps in the district. This is the first time norovirus infection has been reported from Thrissur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/57-norovirus-cases-confirmed-in-thrissur/article37744537.ece
29 November 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Youth comprise major chunk of accident victims’||A research study conducted recently by the neurosurgery department of Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences (SVIMS) has attributed most of the road accidents in general, and around the temple city of Tirupati in particular, to behavioural issues on part of the driver. The study was conducted by Assistant Professor G. Sriram under the headship of V.V. Ramesh Chandra of neurosurgery, where information was gathered from the accident victims through questionnaires. Around 80% of the accidents was attributed to the driver behaviour, which includes 25% who did not possess a valid driving license. Driver behaviour here could mean recklessness, lack of concern for safety, lack of regard for rules, over-speeding and drunk driving. ‘Half of them occur after dusk’ The study pointed out that youth in the 15-35 age group comprised a major chunk of victims. More than half the accidents (54%) were witnessed after dusk, i.e., between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. “The study revealed that two-thirds of the mishaps involved two-wheelers and just 2% of the accident victims in four-wheelers were wearing seat belts. Also, driving behaviour has not changed between literate and illiterate victims,” observes Dr. Sriram. The hospital studied 404 cases taken from the Tirupati-Kadapa and Tirupati-Anantapur highways over a period of 15 months, which included the lockdown time that witnessed a dip in accidents. The road stretch between Tirupati and Renigunta witnessed most number of accidents. Around 40% of accidents within the city limits are caused by driving speed of above 50kmph, the study revealed. The study is touted to be the first of its kind to use Google Map coordinates to zero in on the accident prone spots.

Hanuman Chowdhary has said that financial discipline is the need of the hour for ensuring inclusive growth and sustainable development in the State. Delivering the 19th Foundation Day lecture at a webinar organised on ‘Implementation of welfare programmes in Andhra Pradesh: Financial problems, emerging challenges and solutions’, by the Academy of Grassroots Studies and Research of India (AGRASRI) here on Sunday, Mr. Hanuman Chowdhary said the welfare programmes during the last decade were based on personal agenda and the leader’s popularity, but completely ignored the status of financial resources available. Analysing the present financial imbroglio at the national and State levels, Dr. Chowdhary found every government facing financial crunch that could lead to bankruptcy. AGRASRI director D. Sundar Ram said the webinar was aimed at dwelling on key economic issues plaguing the State. Director of Centre for Policy Studies (Visakhapatnam) A. Prasanna Kumar called upon the policymakers to adopt administrative ethics to ensure the welfare programmes reached the real beneficiaries living below the poverty line. Former bureaucrat S.K. Pachauri urged the policymakers to ponder over providing an opportunity to such organisations for contesting in elections to the Panchayat Raj Institutions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/financial-discipline-need-of-the-hour/article37744714.ece

29 November 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Students told to read subjects for pleasure||Assistant Commissioner, Income Tax, T. Saveesh Varma on Sunday urged students to read their subjects for pleasure rather than treating them as a burdensome curriculum. Addressing students of Sarat Chandra IAS Academy, at a cultural fest-cum awareness programme on UPSC exams for the academy students, he said cracking the Civils examinations was an effective way to fulfil one’s desire to serve the needy in the society. Speaking about the myths associated with the UPSC exams, he said it is not true that Civils exam is a tough nut to crack. “Along with hard work and dedication, if you invest adequate amount of interest, navigating the preparation period would become a cakewalk,” he said adding that many students had passed the exam in Telugu medium and were serving the society in various capacities. The Academy’s Managing Director T. Sarat Chandra said the objective of the event was to combine education and entertainment in a manner that the students were the ultimate beneficiaries. The cultural fest ‘Rhythm Divine’ that followed saw the students showcasing their talent in co-curricular activities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/students-told-to-read-subjects-for-pleasure/article37744718.ece
29 November 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Release incentives to gram panchayats in one month’||BJP State president Somu Veerraju on Sunday demanded that the government immediately release incentives to 2,199 panchayats that witnessed unanimous elections, as per G.O. Rt. No.34 issued on January 26, 2021, within a month. In a letter to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, Mr. Veerraju said the government had not paid a single rupee to such panchayats long after increasing the amount of incentives. A total of 2,199 panchayats had witnessed unanimous polls believing that the State government would give them the announced rewards and the monies would be helpful in creating basic infrastructure. “But their expectations are belied, as the government’s promise is confined to rhetoric,” he alleged. If the YSRCP government was committed to developing the villages, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy should implement the G.O. in letter and spirit in one month lest the BJP should organise State-wide protests. Mr. Veeeraju said by bringing the expenditure of local bodies under the purview of Comprehensive Financial Management System (CFMS), the government undermined their development. The CFMS was hampering the flow of funds to the panchayats, which ought to have funds directly devolved to them as per the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, he said, adding that the government should stop “robbing the financial autonomy” of the panchayats, and provide them funds without any interference.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/release-incentives-to-gram-panchayats-in-one-month/article37745215.ece
29 November 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||HC to resume hearing of capital cases today||The hearing of the three capitals cases by the High Court on Monday is set to take a curious turn due to the unanticipated withdrawal of the Andhra Pradesh Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions and CRDA Repeal Acts by the government last week and its decision to come up with a new legislation in favour of separate capital cities for legislative, executive and judicial functions. A full Bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra will examine along with its background the AP Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Repeal Act, 2021 which was passed in the Legislative Assembly on November 22 when the High Court was hearing a batch of writ petitions that challenged the Decentralisation and the CRDA Repeal Acts of 2020. It was ratified by the Council on November 23. The Acts have been in the eye of a storm since they were approved in the Assembly in July 2020 but referred by the Council to a select committee amidst dramatic scenes viewed from the gallery by the Opposition leader and TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu. Within no time, farmers who gave their lands for the development of a greenfield capital city in the Vijayawada-Guntur region, which was named Amaravati, approached the High Court seeking justice. However, the hearing of the cases made no significant progress mainly due to the change of two Chief Justices (J.K. Maheswari and Arup Kumar Goswami) and the sheer volume of material that needed scrutiny and some pertinent questions of law to be answered. Govt. stand Regarding the AP Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Repeal Act, 2021, the government made it amply clear that it was actually intended to bring a new comprehensive Bill that will dispel the wrong notions of the aggrieved land-givers and clarify its position on alleged acts of Constitutional impropriety being argued upon in the High Court. In the ‘statement of objects and reasons’ for the said Repeal Act, Finance and Legislative Affairs Minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy said the Decentralisation and CRDA Repeal Acts were in line with the long-cherished promise of the Sribagh Pact and the development of backward areas, including Uttarandhra. It was also mentioned that the Acts also took due note of the periodic regional agitations that eventually led to the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ap-hc-to-resume-hearing-of-three-capital-cases-today/article37744527.ece

Chandrababu Naidu has urged Chief Secretary Sameer Sharma to take the necessary steps to provide a ‘comprehensive relief package’ for the flood-hit areas in Kadapa, Chittoor, Nellore and Anantapur districts. In a letter on Sunday, Mr. Naidu lamented that it is ‘tragic’ that the government had released only Rs. 35 crore though the preliminary estimates had put the crop and property losses in the floods at Rs. 6,054.29 crore. Immediate and adequate relief should be provided in view of the huge loss of life and livelihoods, he said. The government should provide an ex gratia of Rs. 25 lakh to the families which lost their dear ones during the heavy rains and floods. An assistance of Rs. 2 lakh should be given to the injured people. Free housing should be provided to all the victims who have lost their houses. The victims of partially damaged houses should be given a compensation of Rs. 25,000, while Rs. 10,000 should be provided as compensation where rain or flood water has entered the houses, he said. Pointing out that farmers and agricultural labourers were the worst affected, Mr. Naidu said the government should not only buy the damaged agricultural produce, but it was equally important to provide compensation for the partially or completely damaged crops, he said. The former Chief Minister urged the Chief Secretary for ensuring a per hectare price of Rs. 30,000 for paddy, Rs. 50,000 for banana, Rs. 25,000 for sugarcane, Rs. 30,000 for cotton, Rs. 25,000 for groundnut, Rs. 15,000 for jowar, Rs. 20,000 for maize, Rs. 20,000 for sunflower, Rs. 50,000 for cashew, Rs. 3,000 per coconut plant, Rs. 40,000 for mango and Rs. 2,500 per palmyra palm tree. Mr. Naidu stressed the need for providing compensation for loss of livelihoods to help people to get back on their feet after the COVID-induced financial duress and flood havoc. Loss of livelihood “The government should pay Rs. 20,000 each to weavers, street vendors and auto-rickshaw drivers for loss of livelihood. Some toddy tappers, fishermen, agricultural labourers and etc who have lost their livelihood. They should also be provided with 50 kg rice as a special assistance,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-seeks-comprehensive-relief-package-for-flood-victims/article37745221.ece

29 November 2021||Visakhapatnam,ANDHRA PRADESH||Doctors stress strict adherence to COVID-appropriate behaviour||At a time when the corona curve is inching close to the flattening stage in the city, the detection of a new and more dangerous variant, B. 1.1.529, in South Africa, sounds the alarm bells, keeping the third wave threat alive. When contacted, experts, however, expressed divergent views on the possibility of the third wave hitting India. While no one is sure whether the third wave ‘will’ or ‘will not’ affect India, all doctors suggest continuation of COVID-19 appropriate behaviour at least till the entire population is vaccinated. “The third wave has spread across Europe and some nations have even reported the fourth wave. The case load is high even in the USA. This could be due to their reluctance to get vaccinated and opposing restrictions on their movement,” says S.N.R. Naveen, Assistant Professor of Medicine, Andhra Medical College (AMC), quoting the findings of a study conducted in the U.S.A. “The study has pointed out that despite being well-educated there is vaccine-resistance among the people to the extent that they are ready to quit their jobs rather than take the jab. On the contrary, there was no vaccine-resistance or opposition to lockdown in India,” he says. “Though there was some initial vaccine-hesitancy among our people, they fell in line within no time, and after the second wave, there was a scramble to take the shot in India. Now, parents are eagerly waiting o get their children, below 18 years of age, vaccinated,” says Dr. Naveen. “The rising number of cases in Europe and the USA, and now the detection of the new B.1.1.529 variant is a cause for concern. England has banned entry of people from South Africa into its territory. Compared to Europe and the USA, the vaccine coverage is less in India,” says K. Rambabu, Director of the Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS). Recalling his experience in dealing with COVID-19 affected patients, Dr. Rambabu says, “I have seen that previously infected patients have a much lower risk compared to those who have received both doses. This ‘innate immunity’ seems to be protecting recovered patients much better than vaccinated persons.” “Though the chances of a third wave in India are minimal. If the virus becomes endemic and confines to a few places, the chances of a third wave can be ruled out in India,” says Dr. Rambabu. “The threat of the third wave can be averted, if our people are fully vaccinated. The completion of the second dose before the Sankranti festival, can go a long way in checking spread of the virus,” says P.V. Sudhakar, Principal, Andhra Medical College. The emergence of breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated people is a cause for concern. “The government may take a decision on administering booster dose, based on the breakthrough infections,” adds Dr. Sudhakar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/doctors-stress-strict-adherence-to-covid-appropriate-behaviour/article37745223.ece

Students of various law colleges have shown that they are not only proficient in their subject but also displayed their talents in the competitions conducted as part of the ongoing 72nd Constitution Day celebrations, jointly organised by The Hindu FIC and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL). The second prize in quiz went to R.S. Lakshmi Narayana, K. Lahari Nath and Y. Pravallika of NBM Law College, Visakhapatnam, and the second prize in debate was bagged by Phani Shekar, Anusha and M.V. Raman of NBM Law College. The rival teams despite their conflicting opinions agreed that a strong Centre was needed for the progress of the nation as a whole. They, however, felt that the Centre should not impose itself on the States. One of the teams said that a strong Centre instills the idea of unity, suppresses separatism, promotes sharing of resources between States. This was also necessary to represent India at the international-level. The rival team underlined the need to ensure ‘independence’ of the States. When Y. Satyanarayana, former Vice-Chancellor of DSNLU, asked one of the teams on the poor response of the Centre to the pandemic, they attributed it the unprecedented situation, which had not given it the time. When the same question was posed to the rival team on the failure of the States to control the pandemic, they said the States were expecting the Centre to do everything and they felt it was wrong on their part. Senior Civil Judge K.K.V. Bullikrishna explained that the right to legal aid was a fundamental right, guaranteed by the Constitution. While strong Centre and States were required, strong citizens would make a strong nation. Citizens could be strong only when they know of their rights and duties as enshrined in the Constitution, he said. Prof. Satyanarayana complimented the media for keeping democracy alive despite the ‘erratic political system’. Commending The Hindu for associating with the law schools, he said: “Your association would help them.” HPCL Visakh Region Executive Director V. Ratan Raj, ED-VRMP P. Veerabhadra Rao and General Manager-HR K. Nagesh gave away prizes to the winners. The quiz was conducted by Quiz Master P. Venkata Murali and the debate competition was judged by Prof. Satyanarayana, Vydyula Ravindra Prasad, president, Visakhapatnam Bar Association, P.V.

She told The Hindu that the sugarcane grown by the farmers of the district would be sent to the Sankili sugar factory in Srikakulam district as NCS Sugars of Latchayyapeta declined to take up crushing operations for the year 2021-22 due to various reasons. “The Cane Commissioner has issued orders for the diversion of sugarcane to EID Parry (India) Limited sugar factory as NCS Sugars has not yet entered into any agreement with farmers this year.

29 November 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Curtains fall on most single-screen theatres||First-day first-show, bunking classes to watch Suhaag in January 1980, the first ‘naughty’ movie and the first kiss — there are a zillion memories for city residents that played out in the darkness of cinema halls. But this long affair with cinema halls seems to be fading rather rapidly. From the time of screening of black-and-white silent movies in tents to talkies, to the surround sound magic to the digitally streamed movies inside cinema halls, Hyderabad has seen it all. But the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and subsequent lockdowns have accelerated the demise of cinema halls in the city. Rise and fall On the eve of Independence and merger with India, Hyderabad had 17 cinema halls. The number peaked to a high of 113 in the late 80s. And from that peak, the descent started as video cassettes, DVDs, Blu Ray followed by piracy on streaming online services dealt a blow to cinema-watching experience. “Watching movies at a single screen theatre is an experience. No YouTube video or OTT service can replicate it,” says actor Aziz Naser, adding that he never missed a single movie in Milan, Priya, Skyline, Sangeet and Sterling. “The first movie I remember watching on my own was Killer in Lata, Nampally, where the ticket was Rs. 1. I was in Class X then. The joy of watching the movie, the occasional wait for the reel to arrive from a different theatre was something else. I feel sad when I watch theatres in ruined and deserted state with their seats covered in dust,” says Mr. Naser, who remembers watching his own movie Angrez at Maheshwari. A movie which later marked silver jubilee at the Ramakrishna theatre. While names like Sangeet, Skyline and Liberty have survived in public memory, others have faded except for popping up at unexpected places. Lighthouse is an electronic goods showroom in Gunfoundry area. “I started the shop with the name as it was popular and the cinema hall was in this location. It’s been decades since the cinema hall was brought down. A commercial complex is coming up there,” says the owner of the electronic goods showroom. Without a trace A little ahead, a bidriware shop has Zamarrud Mahal as part of its location marker. “The cinema hall is long gone. Now it is being used as a parking place. It was at this cinema that Razakar leader Kasim Razvi gave his famous speech. The cinema halls doubled as function halls,” says historian Sajjad Shahid, who remembers watching movies as some of them continued the practice of purdah which was either balcony or box. Zamarrud was a precursor to the recliner seats as it had cushioned sofas in the front for the well-heeled paying Rs. 5 per ticket while the not-so-well off could watch for six annas from the rear of the hall. Some cinema halls were quirky with pillars in front of some seats. “Embassy was a small cinema hall with a column in the middle. You had to go early to get the seat with a good view,” adds Mr. Shahid, who recalls the role of architect Taruj Ahmed Khan for the design of Shaam, Skyline and Royal and other theatres. While the architects of other cinema halls are not well known, their flirtation with Art Deco movement can still be seen at the Saptagiri with its flared frontage, or Shanti or the Yakut Mahal which was completed in 1938 at the peak of the architectural movement. Yakut Mahal which still draws the crowds, albeit to a lesser extent, had a brilliant sound system and a bright projector which was a killer preposition. In the 30s, Select Talkies had a phone number of 826 located at Baradari Nawab Salar Jung Bahadur, 50s Royal had the number of 4762, the phone numbers disappeared from advertisements. Instead tag lines like ‘A neat and clean picture that will entertain your whole family’ for Dharti Kahey Pukar Ke popped up. By 90s, Skyline, Kumar and Lamba were showing movies like Manifesto for a Night of Love, drawing a sizeable male clientele. But the darkness was closing in quickly. Each cinema hall developed its own USP. At Sangeet, it was mint chutney sandwich, at Anand it was the samosas. Then there were cinema halls that catered to niche audiences with Tamil, Marathi, Malayalam and Kannada film screenings. Unending bad news One of the earliest movies to fall under the hammer was Palace, which made way for the MPM Mall. After that, it has been a steady stream of bad news for single screen theatres with some turning into furniture malls, some into function halls while others have been turned into commercial complexes. The COVID-19 lockdown has accelerated the pace of destruction of single screen theatres. Now, only about 62 survive. With their disappearance, a way of life is disappearing for a generation of movie lovers.  No YouTube video or OTT service can replicate the experience of watching movies at a single screen theatre. I feel sad when I watch theatres in ruined state with their seats covered in dust.

29 November 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Cong. to protest at Jantar Mantar||Stating that the present paddy crisis in Telangana was not natural but created due to the negligence and arrogance of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and the Central government, Telangana Congress chief A. Revanth Reddy vowed to take it to New Delhi with a dharna at Jantar Mantar to expose the joint conspiracy of KCR and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He said the dharnawass being planned anytime between December 9 and 13 to project the travails of the Telangana farmers and also raise the issue in Parliament while an all-party delegation would also submit a representation to Governo, Tamilisai Soundararajan on November 29. ‘Hue and cry’ Mr. Reddy, who was speaking at the two-day 'Vari Deekhsha' organised by Kisan Congress at Dharna Chowk, Indira Park here on Sunday, said BJP president Bandi Sanjay, who made a hue and cry about paddy procurement, was now talking about education and health issues clearly showing how the BJP and the TRS had conspired to relegate farmers’ issue to the background. Earlier, senior leader K. Jana Reddy offered lime juice to Mr. Revanth Reddy and Bhongir MP Komatireddy Venkata Reddy to call off the two-day deeksha that saw participation of senior leaders and farmers. The Congress leaders slept at the venue itself. He accused the CM of staging a ‘fake dharna’ at the Indira Park and indulging in some ‘dhandha’ during his New Delhi visit. “Instead of waging a war against the Centre CM partied at MP Suresh Reddy’s residence at the cost of farmers,” he alleged. “Then he sends a delegation of Ministers KT. Rama Rao and Mahmood Ali, who don’t understand agriculture, to meet Union Agriculture Minister Piyush Goyal. The only assurance KCR got from Delhi was that Telangana BJP leaders will no more talk about paddy farmers.” Mr. Komatireddy, Congress MLAs D. Sreedhar Babu and Seethakka, MLC T. Jeevan Reddy, Ponnala Lakshmaiah and K, Jana Reddy explained how the Congress governments came to the rescue of farmers in crisis and how ‘heartless’ KCR was. Mr. Sreedhar Babu said Congress governments increased the MSP 8 times while the BJP government hiked it just twice in seven years. The Kisan Congress introduced 9 resolutions in support of the farmers and they were approved by the gathering. TJS chief M. Kodandaram and former MLA Gummadi Narsaiah also spoke.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cong-to-protest-at-jantar-mantar/article37744764.ece
29 November 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Ace choreographer Shiva Shankar Master no more||Prominent choreographer Shiva Shankar Master, who had contracted severe form of COVID-19 and was undergoing treatment at a corporate hospital in Gachibowli for the past few days, died on Sunday evening. He was 72. He is survived by wife Suganya and two sons, Vijay and Ajay. It was learnt that 90% of his lungs were affected due to the infectious disease and he was on mechanical ventilator support. Shiva Shankar Master was admitted to AIG Hospital, Gachibowli, with severe complication arising out of COVID-19. His wife Suganya and elder sister Vijay Shivashankar too tested positive for COVID-19. While Suganya is in home isolation, their son is undergoing treatment at another hospital. Earlier last week, the ace choreographer’s younger son Ajay Shivashankar made an open appeal seeking financial support for his father’s treatment. Responding to the appeal, actors Chiranjeevi, Sonu Sood and Dhanush extended financial assistance for the treatment. Born on December 7, 1948, in Chennai, Shiva Shankar ‘Master’ as he is known in the film industry, had worked in nearly 800 films covering 10 languages. A strong foundation in classical dance helped Shiva Shankar choreograph all forms of dances and his choreography for ‘Dheera Dheera...’ in Rajamouli's Maghadheera won him the National Award in 2011. A versatile artiste, Shiva Shankar who trained under veteran choreographer Salim, acted in nearly 30 films on being requested by a few directors. As judge for a TV dance reality show, he became a household name. His witty and lovable Tamil-accented Telugu used to draw more audience to the show. Shiva Shankar moved to Hyderabad from Chennai a few years ago due to personal reasons. Telugu film personalities took to Twitter to offer condolences to the late choreographer. Chiranjeevi expressed deep shock at the untimely demise of the veteran choreographer. Bahubali director S.S.Rajamouli in his Twitter tribute said: “Sad to know that renowned choreographer Shiva Shankar Master garu has passed away. Working with him for Magadheera was a memorable experience. May his soul rest in peace. Condolences to his family”. “Heartbroken to hear about the demise of Shiv Shankar masterji. Tried our best to save him but God had different plans. Will always miss you masterji. May almighty give strength to the family to bear this loss. Cinema will always miss u sir,” tweeted Sonu Sood. Actors Pawan Kalyan and RamCharan also condoled his death.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ace-choreographer-shiva-shankar-master-no-more/article37745021.ece
29 November 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||End of the road for Amba theatre||The iconic Amba Theatre in the Mehdipatnam area has been torn down to make way for a proposed retail mall. Catering to the student community in Santoshnagar, Mehdipatnam, Gudimalkapur and Masab Tank, the single-screen theatre screening both Hindi movies like ‘Qurbaani’, ‘Amar Akbar Anthony’ to Telugu movies like ‘Vakeel Saab’ was very popular till the Over-The-Top streaming platforms took off in a big way. The two successive lockdowns due to COVID proved to be a double whammy from which the cinema hall could not escape. The last screening was that of a romantic movie starring Ramya Krishna and two unknown actors. “There were no viewers for many shows. I think that’s why the owners decided to turn into a commercial complex,” said the security person at the site. As the news about the demolition spread on social media, many residents in the surrounding areas shared their movie experiences at the cinema hall. “I watched movies almost everyday during my college days as the theatre had a very good ambience, was well-maintained and was among the first to get Dolby surround sound system,” said Sridhar, who remembers watching the 1996 blockbuster ‘Prema Desam’. The theatre was very popular with students from the University of Hyderabad, as the nearby bus depot had a ticket booking counter. “University students would come to the area to book their bus tickets, watch a movie and then catch the bus home. That was the routine for many,” says Sridhar about the 1996-2000 period before online ticket booking became the norm. In November 2020, as cinema halls remained shut due to COVID protocol, word spread that five cinema halls, including Amba, were being axed. The officials denied the news at that time saying there is no change of ownership. Another theatre that has been razed during this period is Galaxy in Tolichowki area. The financial details of the transaction or the current ownership pattern of the site could not be ascertained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/end-of-the-road-for-amba-theatre/article37745015.ece
29 November 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Fill vacant posts immediately’||The State Executive of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) demanded that the government to all vacant posts immediately by issuing notifications. Similarly, it has also felt that the outcome of Huzurabad by-election is an indication of future political picture unveiling in the state. The two-day party state executive was held here on November 26 and 27 presided over by party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar and attended by all other leaders of the party. As many as five resolutions were adopted by the party including on unemployment, Dalit Bandhu, problems being faced by farmers, hitches in Dharani and a political resolution on the prevailing conditions in the State. “During the seven-year rule of the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), the State has failed on all fronts and it was under the total control of KCR family. Corruption is at its peak. The outcome of the Huzurabad by-election with winning of former minister E Rajender jolted the TRS. Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao was forced to come out of farm house and reach Dharna Chowk. Despite spending hundreds of crores of rupees by the ruling party and people taught a fitting lesson and it was indication of future political picture in the state,” said the political resolution and thanked the voters for voting party candidate. Coming to the financial front in the state, the BJP said that debt of the State had reached Rs. 4 lakh crore and even to pay salaries for employees the government had to opt for overdraft from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and some contractors committed suicide unable to repay the loans they had availed. Stating that even bills related to COVID-related medicines and equipment were pending for a long time, suppliers rejecting to resume supply indicates the seriousness. Terming the ruling of Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) as ‘dictatorial,’ the political resolution stated that the Chief Minister and Ministers instigating party workers on BJP activists was nothing but undemocratic and police were working under the control of TRS. On unemployment, the resolution said that about 200 unemployed persons committed suicide whereas Biswal Committee stated vacancy of 1.91 lakh in addition to regular retirements every year. Telangana State Public Service Commission former chairman Ghanta Chakrapani has admitted that only 29,091 posts were filled, it added. It has also questioned the promise of unemployment allowance. The resolution passed on Dalit Bandhu questioned the sincerity of the government in implementing the scheme and wondered what happened to the promise.

It had also pointed out that several farmers, particularly tenant farmers, had committed suicide but compensations were not paid.

Collector Siddipet issued orders to Revenue Divisional Officers (RDO) of Siddipet and Gajwel on November 26, ordering them to transfer the voters. “The voters have been shifted to Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) Colony Mutrajpally of Gajwel mandal due to submergence of villages under Mallannasagar reservoir under Kaleshwaram project. The RDOs of Siddipet and Gajwel are requested to conduct special camps to obtain the forms from electors who are affected by submergence of villages and to complete the entire process up to November 30 without fail,” directed the Collector.

However, houses were constructed for about 2,300 oustees while remaining had opted for house sites.

29 November 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Two die while cleaning septic tank||Two sanitation workers died of asphyxiation while cleaning a sewage tank at high-rise apartments in IT Corridor’s Kondapur area on Sunday morning. Police said that the victims, Nenavath Srinu (40) and Ullamgonda Anjaiah (32), were residents of the Singareni Colony of Saidabad and worked for septic tank cleaning vehicle owner-cum-driver Swamy. While Srinu was a native of Manjyathanda in Nalgonda, Anjaiah was from Achampet in Nagarkurnool district. According to Gachibowli inspector G Suresh, at 7 a.m. the victims along with Swamy and fellow worker Jaanu began the cleaning at Gautami Enclave. Initially, they cleared the sewage water with pipes and later Srinu and Anji entered the tank to clear the debris. They reportedly inhaled toxic gases and fainted inside. “Around 8 a.m. as there was no movement from Srinu and Anji, Swamy entered the tank, found them floating in the two-foot water, and came out as he felt uneasy,” Mr. Suresh said. The fire department personnel from the Madhapur fire station rushed to the spot and by wearing the Breathing Apparatus Set (BAS) they went inside the tank and pulled out the bodies. Police said that the sanitation workers did not take basic safety measures before entering the tank which resulted in the unfortunate incident. Family members of the victims staged a protest near the apartment and demanded justice. A case was registered against Swamy and the bodies were shifted to Osmania General Hospital for autopsy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/two-die-while-cleaning-septic-tank/article37745031.ece
29 November 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Ryots bearing the brunt’||BJP legislator from Huzurabad Eatala Rajender demanded the State government for immediate procurement of paddy. While clarifying the Centre’s stand on paddy procurement from Telangana, he said that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao who was well aware of the drawn agreements, was delaying the process on purpose as he was still not over with the Huzurabad bypoll result. “KCR became desperate, impatient and is unable to deal with the frustration from TRS loss in Huzurabad. Now, farmers are bearing the brunt of his restlessness,” Mr. Rajender said while speaking to the media at Choutuppal and Suryapet, during his tour to Khammam. “Why isn’t the rich State, as publicised by Chief Minister, unable to procure farmers’ produce now? Even after agreements, why did the State not make alternate measures with respect to paddy?” Mr. Rajender pointed out. He said the rulers must keep aside politics and address farmers in their hour of need.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ryots-are-bearing-the-brunt/article37745039.ece

But Asraf-un-Nisa Begum was awarded the civilian honour when she saved five women after a fire broke out in the Moti Mahal Cinema near the Residency building on June 14, 1936. “She was sitting in the purdah balcony with many women and children. The fire cut off both exits, so she stripped herself of her sari, tied it to the balcony railing and lowered five women to the lower floor, from where they escaped,” says the citation of her medal.  While she could successfully help the other women down the sari, she had run out of time and jumped injuring herself. Fourteen people were killed in the blaze and stampede when the movie College Girl was being screened some time after 9 p.m. on the fateful night.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/gallantry-in-the-purdah-section/article37745013.ece

29 November 2021||KARIMNAGAR,TELANGANA||TRS moves to check cross-voting||An overwhelming majority of the elected representatives of both rural and urban local bodies belonging to the ruling TRS of the erstwhile composite Karimnagar district left for camps being organised by the party MLC election campaign managers at far-off places ahead of the December 10 biennial election to the Karimnagar Local Authorities Constituency (LAC). Many ruling party local body representatives, who constitute the voters of the election, left for camps in special buses bound for Bengaluru and other destinations in Karnataka on Saturday night, sources said. The party key functionaries made arrangements for their stay in resorts/function halls there till December 9, sources added. The TRS has comfortable numbers to win the two MLC seats from Karimnagar LAC. An estimated 1324 voters comprising elected representatives of rural and urban local bodies, ex-officio members including MLAs are eligible to vote in MLC election. In a sudden move, former Karimnagar mayor Sardar Ravinder Singh entered the fray as an independent candidate and announced his decision to quit the ruling party. He also claimed support of several elected representatives of local bodies, irrespective of party affiliation, to his candidature. This prompted ruling party campaign managers to shift the party’s elected representatives in an apparent attempt to prevent cross-voting. Sources said general body meetings of Yellareddypeta and Gambiraopeta mandals in Rajanna-Sircilla were postponed due to lack of quorum last week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/move-to-check-cross-voting/article37745047.ece
29 November 2021||KHAMMAM,TELANGANA||26 passengers of RTC bus have a close shave||Around 26 passengers of a Hyderabad-bound TSRTC bus had a providential escape in the wee hours of Sunday after the bus overturned while negotiating a damaged portion of the road under repair near Ambedkarnagar in Thallada mandal. Five passengers of the bus sustained minor injuries in the incident that occurred at about 1 a.m. The TSRTC sources attributed the incident to lack of caution boards or warning signs at the site of road repair works. The driver of the bus reportedly lost control of the vehicle while crossing the stretch of the worn-out road, which is being repaved, resulting in the accident on the Kothagudem-Khammam highway. The bus flipped over onto its right side before coming to a halt beside a tree. The huge tree along the highway acted as a safety barrier, thus avoiding a major accident, sources added. The officials of the TSRTC Kothagudem depot deployed another bus and facilitated the onward journey of the passengers in the wee hours of the day. Sources said the authorities of the public transport entity are mulling to file a complaint against the contractor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/26-passengers-of-rtc-bus-have-a-close-shave/article37745033.ece

Earlier, he participated in a meeting organised by the police at the Kazipet police station to raise awareness on the helmet rule for all two-wheeler riders.

29 November 2021||November 29 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||Civil servants set an example||There were quite a few instances where IAS officers preferred government facilities wherever they were posted to attend to requirements of their kith and kin. Earlier this month, Collector of Bhadradri-Kothagudem Anudeep Durishetty got his wife admitted to the Government Area Hospital at Bhadrachalam for delivery although better options were available to him. She gave birth to a baby-boy. A few days later, another Collector in the State admitted his two daughters at a local Anganwadi School (pre-school). There were also instances earlier where a Collector admitted her daughter to a government school run by the Telangana State Minorities Residential Educational Institutions Society and another Collector admitted his daughter to a government hospital for delivery. “No doubt we find such instances at least now and then but what about our politicians,” asks a bureaucrat.   With many officers eyeing the seat of Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic) in the city much before Mr. Anil Kumar exited and was posted as State Intelligence Chief, the sudden posting of Mr. Vijay Kumar as in-charge of that post has disappointed a few Inspectors-General of Police rank officers who have been knocking on every possible door to get into the city police. Though Mr. Vijay Kumar is appointed in-charge Additional CP, his less-than-one-week deputation during recent Ganesh Nimajjanam in Hyderabad came forth as a signal that he might be taken into Hyderabad police after a successful tenure with Intelligence Bureau (IB).   After a brief halt, the fear of Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has once again come to haunt the administration, if not people, in general. Incidence of the new variant Omicron in some countries has raised an alarm among the official machinery but people apparently remained unconcerned about the new strain described as variant of concern by the WHO. Mass gatherings like marriages, especially in the current marriage season, could lead to spurt of the virus, but people continue to attend such events without following the prescribed protocols.   Blame game between State and Central Governments over paddy procurement is unlikely to subside at least for the time being. It may be recalled that the Food Corporation of India has commended the State over paddy procurement for the Central pool, claiming that Telangana continued to be top in the matter. Farmers went for paddy cultivation with enthusiasm but the Centre poured cold water on them fixing the quota of procurement at far lower levels for kharif.  (B.

29 November 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Odisha’s sex ratio at birth slides||Researchers on gender issues and activists have expressed concerns over decline in sex ratio at birth for children born in Odisha in the last five years. The National Family Health Survey 2020-21 (NFHS-5) says that there is sharp decline in sex ratio at birth for children born in the last five years (females per 1000 males) in Odisha. It has come down from 932 from NFHS-4 to 894 in NFHS-5. Wide variation has been noticed in sex ratio at birth in urban and rural pockets the State. While the sex ratio at birth in past five years in urban areas is 950, it is estimated at 885 in rural area. On the contrary, overall sex ratio (females per 1000 males) of the State appeared to be healthy. Against sex ratio of 1,036 found in NFHS-4, there has been perceptible improvement in NFHS-5 and the sex ratio has gone up to 1,063. Ironically, overall sex ratio is healthy in rural area at 1,074 compared to 1,010 in urban areas. As far as sex ratio at birth in five years is concerned, activists attributed it to impact of preference for males over females. ‘Disturbing trend’ “This is very disturbing trend. It indicates more preference is being given to sons over daughters. The discrimination reflected in the trend is likely to distort the population balance,” said Asha Hans, a leading researcher on gender issues. Ms. Hans said, “low sex ratio at birth in rural sectors points to the fact that the social structure is still very weak. Despite massive awareness campaign launched under National Health Mission, patriarchal culture factor still dominates.” Uppali Mohanty, an activist working with CYSD, a city-based non-government organization, said, “this is a dangerous indicator. The State government must get its act together to reverse the trend through sensitization and checking sex selection before child’s birth.” “If the sex ratio at birth is allowed to slide further, the society may head for imbalance like being noticed in some of the northern States of India,” said Ms. Mohanty. According to NFHS-5, Odisha has, however, registered improvement in female education, institutional delivery and health of mothers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/odishas-sex-ratio-at-birth-slides/article37745116.ece

29 November 2021||CHENNAI,||Heavy rain may shift to south Tamil Nadu today||After pummelling the north coastal areas, the heavy rain may shift to south Tamil Nadu on Monday. The intense rain may take a break from November 30 and decrease gradually. The cyclonic circulation over the Comorin area and the adjoining Sri Lanka coast in the lower level may move and emerge in the Arabian Sea by Monday. Officials of the India Meteorological Department said that while the easterlies over the coastal areas would push moisture into the land, the moving weather system would bring in south-westerly winds. Some parts of south coastal Tami Nadu, such as Kanniyakumari, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi and Ramanathapuram, are likely to receive heavy to very heavy rain on Monday, owing to the wind convergence. Most other parts of the coastal region, including Chennai, may receive moderate rain. Chennai pounded On Sunday, rain lashed several coastal districts. Puducherry, Kalavai in Ranipet district and Cuddalore recorded 7 cm from 8.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. More areas of Chennai went under water as rain pounded the city. In the past 24 hours ending 8.30 a.m. on Sunday, Pamban and Mandapam in Ramanathapuram district and Mamallapuram received a very heavy rainfall of 11 cm each. Schools and colleges in many districts, including Puducherry, Karaikal, Thoothukudi and Tiruvallur, have declared a holiday for Monday.

29 November 2021||GURUGRAM,||Special camps to help augment income of BPL families in Haryana||Special camps will be held across Haryana over the next one month till December 25, aiming to pass on the benefits of various government welfare schemes and provide self-empolyment opportunities to around 1.5 lakh Below Poverty Line (BPL) families, identified through the State government’s “Parivar Pechan Patra” scheme. This was announced by Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal at a press conference in Chandigarh on Sunday. The camps will be held at 180 blocks across districts starting from November 29 under Mukhyamantri Antyodaya Utthan Yojana. The Chief Minister said the details provided under “Parivar Pehchan Patra” scheme had revealed that around 3.25 lakh families in the State had income of less than Rs. 1 lakh per annum, and the government had decided to help augment the income of 1.5 lakh of these families in the first phase of the programme. He said that around 38,000 families had income even less than Rs. 50,000 per month. “The series of meetings in this regard have led to the conclusion that these people are not able to take advantage of various Central and State government schemes for lack of knowledge or face other difficulties. There are schemes for loans from banks as well for self-employment, but they face difficulty in availing these too. So a joint effort involving the government agencies and the banks will be made to help these people double their income and lead a better life,” said Mr. Lal. He said that according to the schedule, eligible families short-listed for the programme would be invited to Antyodaya Gram Utthan Melas, which would be held for two or three days initially. “Based on the feedback, schedule would be released for the remaining weeks,” said Mr. Lal. ‘42 schemes identified’ He said that 42 schemes had been identified which would help in increasing the income of such families. Preference will be given to Scheduled Castes, backward Classes, women, and physically disabled persons. The bank officials would complete the loan formalities during Antyodaya Gram Utthan Melas. Form submission desks will also be set up in these Melas. The camps will be again held in January, and those found eligible would be provided the loans .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/special-camps-to-help-augment-income-of-bpl-families-in-haryana/article37744906.ece

The State has also sought inclusion of more families in the purview of food security. Newly appointed Food and Civil Supplies Minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said here on Saturday that the beneficiaries who had become financially empowered could voluntarily get their names removed from the NFSA list. This would help the poor and needy people get the foodgrains allocated under the scheme, he said. Voluntary removal No legal action would be taken against the financially well-off persons, Government employees and other ineligible persons who get their names removed as soon as possible, Mr. Khachariyawas said. The work of lifting and distribution of foodgrains allotted under NFSA and Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana would be expedited in the districts with slow progress, he added. The records related to over 7 lakh families in 95 blocks of the State were corrected during the first phase of mapping and seeding earlier this year, while the work for seeding of ration cards of about 9 lakh families getting the benefit of NFSA with their Jan Aadhaar cards was taken up during the second phase.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/ineligible-beneficiaries-being-struck-off-nfsa-list-in-rajasthan/article37744912.ece

29 November 2021||Kolkata,||This winter, fairs and festivals return to Kolkata||The return of the numerous winter festivals and fairs after a long pandemic-forced gap is lending an air of normalcy to what is popularly known as the City of Joy and that thrives largely on public celebrations. This weekend marks the beginning of a series of events and exhibitions that will extend well into 2022 and last until the book fair in February and will see gatherings in different parts of Kolkata. Unless the new Omicron strain plays the spoilsport, this winter in Kolkata, always sweetened by the arrival of fresh date-palm jaggery, won’t be very different from those of the pre-COVID times. “It’s a relief to see the festivals and fairs crawling back to life. After two years of staying indoors, it’s surreal to actually be at a venue and enjoy a performance live. The thought itself is giving me goosebumps. What was as regular as drinking water has suddenly become a vanity. The pandemic did turn things around,” said advertising professional Sreelekha Maitra, summing up the general mood in the city. Handicrafts fair begins The events started on Saturday with the West Bengal Government-run Hasta Shilpa Mela, or handicrafts fair, at Eco Park in New Town; it will end on December 20. Then there’s the Backyard Pop-Up, a flea market organised by ‘youthpreneurs’ in south Kolkata from December 10 to 12. These young entrepreneurs had shifted their businesses online due to the pandemic. This three-day event will coincide with Tillottama, a winter carnival to be held at the popular Maddox Square Park. “It’s that old feeling of happiness,” said Howrah-based orthodontist Trisha Ghosh, who also intends to visit The Harvest of Winter, an art and craft exhibition to be held at the Birla Academy of Art & Culture from December 2 to 5. City-based Bharatanatyam dancer Sohini Roychowdhury is looking forward to perform with her troupe at the Art Haat, to be organised by renowned artist Shuvaprasanna’s ArtsAcre Foundation from December 17-20.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/this-winter-fairs-and-festivals-return-to-kolkata/article37744915.ece
29 November 2021||Lucknow,||U.P. polls: RLD identifies 32 seats to contest in partnership with SP||The Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) has identified 32 seats, mostly in western Uttar Pradesh, to contest as a partner of the Samajwadi Party (SP) in the Assembly elections beginning early next year, its State unit chief said on Sunday. RLD workers want party chief Jayant Chaudhary to contest the elections, the party’s Uttar Pradesh unit chief Masood Ahmad said in an interview, adding that if the kin of farmers who died during the farm laws protest are willing to contest on an RLD ticket, the party will take a decision based on their winnability. Mr. Ahmad, however, categorically stated that if the SP-led alliance is voted to power in Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh Yadav will be its Chief Minister and the RLD a partner in the government. “As of now, 32 seats of western Uttar Pradesh have been identified from where the RLD will be fighting. These seats are spread across Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Shamli, Bulandshahr, Hathras, Mathura, Agra, Aligarh, Moradabad and Amroha. The total number of seats on which the party will contest in the upcoming Assembly elections is likely to go up further,” he said. Asked if Jayant Chaudhary will be Deputy Chief Minister if the SP-led alliance wins, Mr. Ahmad said, “I don’t know whether Jayantji will contest or not. Almost three months ago, when I asked him if he would contest the 2022 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, he had said no. But in politics, things change fast.” The entire party wants him to contest, and there are many seats Mr. Chaudhary can choose from, he said, adding, “I am willing to offer him the Tanda Assembly seat (in Ambedkarnagar district).” No agreement yet The RLD and the SP are yet to announce a seat-sharing arrangement for next year’s election to the 403-member Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly. The RLD has one MLA in the outgoing Assembly — Sahendra Singh Ramala from the Chhaprauli in Baghpat. Attacking the BJP over its announcement to repeal the new farm laws, Mr. Ahmad said the party had thought that its heels were dug deep and nobody could force it to change its stance. ‘BJP has misconception’ “They (BJP) had a misconception (’galatfahmi') and false pride (’guroor') about themselves. The party had thought it would crush the farmers’ protest, and that the movement would not sustain for long. The farmers, however, were determined,” the RLD leader said. “It was Chaudhary Ajit Singh (former RLD chief) who had extended support to Rakesh Tikait. Without that it would have been difficult for the farmers' protest to last long after the Red Fort violence incident on Republic Day. Ajit Singh had told Rakesh Tikait not to worry,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/rld-identifies-32-seats-to-contest-in-alliance-with-sp/article37744876.ece
29 November 2021||Mathura (U.P.),||Prohibitory orders imposed in Mathura||The Mathura district administration has imposed prohibitory orders under Cr.PC Section 144, following an announcement by the Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha that it will install a Lord Krishna idol at the deity’s “actual birthplace”, which it claims is in a mosque close to a prominent temple here. “Nobody will be allowed to disturb the peace and tranquillity in Mathura,” District Magistrate Navneet Singh Chahal said. The clampdown comes even as another right wing organisation, Narayani Sena, has said it will take out a march from Vishram Ghat to Sri Krishna Janmasthan, demanding the “removal” of the mosque. Section 144 of the CrPC prohibits the assembly of four or more people in an area. The police said they have detained Narayani Sena secretary Amit Mishra in Mathura Kotwali, while the outfit claimed its national president Manish Yadav has been detained in Lucknow. Security reviewed Mr. Chahal said he, along with Senior Superintendent of Police Gaurav Grover, reviewed the security around both the religious places — the Katra Keshav Dev temple and the Shahi Idgah. He said the Mahasabha had requested permission to install the idol at the mosque but it was turned down. “Question of granting permission to any event that may potentially disrupt peace does not arise,” Mr. Chahal added. Hindu Mahasabha leader Rajyashri Choudhary had earlier said her organisation will install the idol of Lord Krishna in the Shahi Idgah after a “maha jalabhishek” on December 6. The date marks the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/prohibitory-orders-imposed-in-mathura/article37745124.ece
29 November 2021||New Delhi,||Child begging remains a worry||At the busy ITO intersection on a Sunday morning, seven-year-old Anjali was going from one vehicle to another seeking alms. A little distance away, Durga, 20, who identified herself as Anjali’s mother, was selling pens, carrying a baby in her arms. “We are residents of an area near Jaipur and came to Delhi during the lockdown in search of work. My husband is a daily-wage labourer,” Durga said. She, however, refused to talk further and walked away in a hurry with another woman. There were at least four child beggars at the intersection, which is hardly one km from the Delhi Secretariat. Despite laws and multiple directions by the Government to end child begging, it is still a menace in the Capital. The Delhi High Court had on August 13 issued notices to the Centre, Delhi Government and Delhi Police on a PIL for eradication of child begging in the city. Since then, the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) has coordinated the rescue of 69 children from different areas, officials said. As per the results of a study carried out by the Delhi Government and the Institute for Human Development, which were made public in November, there are a total of 4,871 child beggars in the Capital. But activists call the number a “gross underestimate” and say the figure has increased since the COVID-19 pandemic. “In many cases, the family members push the child into begging. These cases are difficult because when such a child is presented before a Child Welfare Committee (CWC), the parents want the child back and they eventually end up in the street again,” said Amod K. Kanth, ex-IPS officer and founder of Prayas, an NGO working for children. Mr. Kanth said the Government and the judiciary are in a way against institutional care for children. Children in need of care “There are 20 million children who are either orphans or homeless or on the streets in India. They should be given a roof over their heads, but the children homes in the country have a capacity to accommodate only 2.5 lakh inmates. The Government is supposed to create infrastructure, but it is not supporting institutional care or non-institutional care,” he said. Under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, a child found working in contravention of labour laws, begging, or living on the streets is called a ‘Child in Need of Care and Protection’ (CNCP). A CNCP, according to the Act, can be presented before a CWC by any official, a social worker or a “public spirited citizen”. Even if a child has a family, but falls under the category of CNCP, the CWC can send the child to a children’s home, if it feels it is needed. The PIL, on which the High Court had issued the notices, was filed by advocate and activist Ajay Gautam, after the authorities “failed” to act. In 2015, he had filed a writ petition in the HC seeking an end to child begging and the HC had disposed of the petition, asking him to first approach the DCPCR. “It is open to him to institute a fresh petition before this court in case the Commission (DCPCR) fails to respond,” the HC had said in its order dated January 1, 2015. Responding to it, on September 4, 2015, the DCPCR issued a 23-point direction to different departments to fight child begging. Six years later, the menace is still prevalent across Delhi and in August, Mr. Gautam approached the HC stating that the Government had failed to stop the practice. Since 2015, Mr. Gautam said, the ground reality on child begging has worsened in Delhi and now, it has become an organised crime. “A four-year-old child doesn’t beg on his own; there is always someone pushing them into this. The Government had accepted in its documents in 2015 that there were child beggars, but why is it not doing anything in this regard?” he asked. Rashmi Singh, director, Department of Women and Child Development, Delhi, said in many cases, parents or guardians push children into begging. “All of these children are not homeless. They stay in settlements in the city and they are forced into begging by parents and guardians in many cases. This makes it difficult for the Government to stop this practice. However, we are trying different measures to bring greater community awareness and vigil to put an end to child begging,” Ms. Singh said. Pandemic Apart from begging, the pandemic has forced many children to become ragpickers for survival and these children also fall under the category of CNCP. Rabhatt, 11, was collecting bottles and plastic from waste bins in a plastic sack on his tricycle in Jor Bagh. He was neither wearing a mask nor gloves. “I live with my brother near a drain. I used to work at a hotel in Bihar, but during the lockdown, it was closed and we came here,” he said. His teeth are stained with paan  and he doesn’t go to school. “I earn about Rs. 300 to Rs. 400 a day and my brother and I send money to my parents in Bihar every month,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/child-begging-remains-a-worry/article37744880.ece
29 November 2021||New Delhi,||Parked proposals||Two years ago, the Delhi Government chalked out the Delhi Maintenance and Management of Parking Places Rules. The Capital’s three municipal corporations — North, South and East — were instructed to develop  parking area management plans (PMAPs) to regularise haphazard parking in commercial and residential areas. The civic bodies were also required to consult Residents’ Welfare Associations (RWAs) during both development and implementation stage. However, the implementation of the policy, aimed at reducing congestion caused by haphazard parking, is yet to gain pace. Take the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), for instance. According to the corporation, PMAPs for 16 locations under its jurisdiction have been developed and put in the public domain. Prem Shankar Jha, Deputy Commissioner of SDMC’s Remunerative Project Cell, said that encroachments, vehicles parked in front of homes, lack of space for cyclists and pedestrians and dumped vehicles were among the long-standing list of problems that were identified across these 16 locations.  Surveys, solutions   Solutions mooted include setting up multilevel car parking facilities, stack and puzzle parking, removal of dumped vehicles, prohibiting parking in congested areas, clearing encroachments and charging a high fee for on-street parking — to discourage long-duration parking. “In most of the 16 locations, the demand for parking surpasses the supply that is available. We’ve observed that even owners with stilt parking facility park their vehicles on streets,” said Mr. Jha. Surveys for some of these locations have thrown up varying issues. In Kailash Colony for instance, while the on-street space is sufficient in residential areas, the commercial and market areas suffer from congestion. In Nizamuddin Basti, only 65 cars can be parked on existing streets without causing congestion. Apart from this, the need for a dedicated tourist parking space was also highlighted. The SDMC plans to convert 713.13 sq.m. of a park in Kailash Colony into a multilevel parking and a portion of the Amir Khusro Park in Nizamuddin Basti into an off-street parking for tourists. Such conversions are prohibited under the proposed Master Plan of Delhi-2021 (MPD-2021). However, Mr. Jha said that the portions marked in Kailash Colony and Nizamuddin Basti were not green areas under master plan. Mr. Jha said the plans will help ensure ample walking space for pedestrians, cycle stations and decongestion in areas that have long-standing issues of haphazard parking; 2% of the parking space will be made available for disabled individuals, including facilities such as ramps. “Apart from the owners who park their vehicles in their colonies which suffer from frequent congestion, no parking of additional vehicles will be allowed there. Alternative spots will be given instead. Available parking facilities will have 2-3 electric vehicle (EV) charging stations,” said Mr. Jha, adding the next step is for the area parking plans to be notified for implementation.  Consultations with RWAs   While physical consultations of PMAPs for three locations – Malviya Nagar, Lajpat Nagar Market, Lajpat Nagar III – were carried out with RWAs, the consultations for the remaining areas were conducted online, said Mr. Jha. However, Rajiv Kakria, member of Greater Kailash I RWA, said that there was no communication regarding the online consultations and that civic bodies consult RWAs only when they want to implement a plan and not while designing it. Atul Goyal, president of United Residents’ Joint Action, said that lack of transparency has led to trust deficit among RWAs. However, he agreed that on-street parking charges may discourage long-duration parking: “It should be implemented because people will be responsible for where they park and for how long.” Not surprisingly, only the PMAPs for Lajpat Nagar Market and Lajpat Nagar III have been implemented so far.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/parked-proposals/article37744902.ece
29 November 2021||New Delhi,||‘I don’t want to go back home’||Barely weeks into his stay at a children’s shelter in the city, nine-year-old Arjun (name changed)  has developed a special liking for the place and doesn’t want to go back home now. “I like it over here... We ate pasta in the morning. Sometimes, we get Maggi too,” he said. Arjun and his younger brother, who were ragpickers, were rescued in an operation coordinated by the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights two weeks ago. They were presented before the Child Welfare Committee and have been sent to the children’s home. Since then, the duo has made a lot of friends and stopped going around parks collecting bottles. “They are teaching us the alphabet... I have not memorised the letters yet though. But I want to study. In Patna, we had been to an anganwadi but never to a school,” Arjun added. He said their father was no more and mother works as a daily-wage labourer. “We started picking up bottles one year ago. My mother was not aware of it as we used to walk out of our rented house in Delhi after she left for work and came back before she returned,” the nine-year-old said. Arjun said their elder brother is also a rag picker. “We used to hand over our daily earnings to him after keeping Rs. 20 to Rs. 30 to buy chips and samosas,” he said. Arjun and his younger brother cried a lot when officials found them on the street, but now he smiled when asked about it. “We thought we were being taken to a jail,” the nine-year-old said, adding, “We always stayed off the main road, but that day we went and were caught.” A few days ago, Arjun said, a group of children escaped from the shelter at night. “I would like to stay here. They take other children to parks. Since I am new, I have been taken only once,” he said, adding that his mother, however, doesn’t approve of their stay at the shelter. About his younger brother, Arjun said, he doesn’t like to study and does not do what the teachers ask him to. The counsellor at the centre said the younger one is interested in other activities. “We have about 50 children who are below 14 years and most of them used to beg. We give them many activities and slowly take them towards studies,” she said. When asked whether he gets chips here, Arjun replied, “We don’t get it here. But when people come to visit, they sometimes bring chips and juice.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/i-dont-want-to-go-back-home/article37744881.ece

According to locals, a group of 20 to 30 people were holding Sunday mass at Ankur Narula Church around 11 a.m., when a group of miscreants, allegedly belonging to Bajrang Dal, came and disrupted the proceedings. Further, they went on to vandalise the church’s entrance and signboard and allegedly manhandled a few devotees attending the prayer. A woman who was part of the prayer, requesting anonymity, said that a group of 30 to 40 people entered the church, which had opened only a week ago, and started using foul language at the worshippers. She added that the group arrived at the church again towards the evening and vandalised it. “All of them were armed and we managed to catch hold of one of them who confessed that he belonged to the group,” the woman said. However, according to a senior police officer, the place was originally a godown, which was turned into a church recently. The officer said after receiving information about the violence, a police team from Bindapur police station rushed to the spot and took statements from both the parties. ‘Godown turned church’ “The locals raised objections and claimed that the godown had been turned into a church overnight and started raising slogans and vandalising the place,” the officer said. An FIR has been registered against the miscreants under Sections of rioting and a case has also been lodged against those attending the mass for violating DDMA guidelines related to COVID-19, the officer said. Efforts are on to identify the miscreants, the officer added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/miscreants-vandalise-church-in-west-delhi/article37744886.ece
29 November 2021||New Delhi,||Restrict air traffic from countries hit by new variant, CM tells Modi||Amid concerns over a new variant of COVID-19, Omicron, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to restrict air traffic from countries currently seeing a rise in virus cases. The CM’s letter came on the eve of a crucial Delhi Disaster Management Authority meeting to assess the Government preparedness to handle a possible surge in cases caused by the new variant. According to sources, the CM will attend the meeting to be chaired by Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal. “Our country has been fighting a tough battle against coronavirus for the last one-and-a-half years. With great difficulty and due to the selfless service of millions of our Covid warriors, our country has recovered from the virus. We should do everything possible to prevent the new variant of concern, recently recognised by the WHO, from entering India,” Mr. Kejriwal said. A number of countries, including the European Union, have suspended travel to the affected regions, he said. “I urge you to stop flights from these regions with immediate effect. Any delay in this regard, which may lead to an affected person enter India, may prove harmful,” the letter said. Meanwhile, the Capital on Sunday reported another death due to COVID-19 for the second consecutive day as the positivity rate went up a notch to 0.06% from 0.05% a day earlier. With 32 new infections, the total case tally stands at 14,40,866. Mr. Kejriwal had on Friday issued directions to the departments concerned in addition to requesting an expert committee to submit suggestions on what steps to be taken to control the new variant. In a tweet, the Chief Minister had also sought to assuage people’s concerns over Omicron and said that the Delhi Government would take all steps necessary to protect citizens and their families from the new threat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/restrict-air-traffic-from-countries-hit-by-new-variant-cm-tells-modi/article37744893.ece

29 November 2021||New Delhi,||HC to look into functioning of children’s homes||Taking a serious view of the incident of escape of five minor girls from a children’s home at Bakhtawarpur in March this year, the Delhi High Court has called for the presence of Joint Director, Child Protection Unit, Department of Women and Child Development, to assess the overall functioning of such institutions in the Capital. Justice Subramonium Prasad gave the direction while hearing a petition which alleged that five minor children aged between 13 and 16 years were kidnapped on March 27, 2021, from Kasturba Gandhi National Memorial Trust (KGNMT), Bakhtawarpur. The petition sought a direction for conducting a magisterial inquiry into the affairs of the institution as to how children of vulnerable age escaped from there. Delhi Police, in its status report, filed before the High Court stated that its official visited the children’s home following the incident and found that the building was about 40-45 years old and the condition of rooms and windows were not good. Building in bad shape They said that the iron roads of the windows were found weak. The back side boundary wall, which is about 8-feet-high, was also found in a deteriorated condition. “As per the present condition of the building, it is very much possible that the inmates can escape easily from there,” the police said. The institution has recently got CCTV cameras installed at the rear side after the escape incident. The police said that at present 63 girls are lodged in KGNMT, Bakhtawarpur, and a total of 16 CCTV cameras are found installed. 14 incidents of escape The police further said that no security guard, especially female guards, were found deployed at KGNMT. During enquiry, it was revealed that total 14 incidents of escape of girls, including the escape of fivegirls, had taken place. “In all the previous incidents, separate FIRs were registered. No active connivance or negligence of the staff of KGNMT could be established till date in the investigation,” the police said in its report. Taking note of the status report, Justice Prasad said, “This petition cannot be confined only to the one incident of March 26- 27, 2021, where five minor children escaped from the home. The overall functioning of the institutions has to be assessed to see as to whether adequate measures have been provided at the homes so as to ensure that the children do not escape from such homes and what facilities have been provided to the children in the homes.” The judge ordered the Joint Director, Child Protection Unit, Department of Women and Child Development, to be present in the court on December 9 for assisting the court in giving directions to ensure better functioning of various child care institutions.

29 November 2021||New Delhi,||Man gets 3 months jail for concealing income||The Delhi High Court has sentenced a man to three months simple imprisonment for acting ‘oversmart’ with the court by suppressing his true income with an intent to evade compliance of the orders passed by the courts asking him to pay maintenance to his estranged wife. A Bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Jasmeet Singh was miffed at the man, who did not come clean despite granting repeated opportunities by the court. “The conduct of the respondent [man]... shows that he has tried to act oversmart with the court by concealing his true income and expenditure, and the channels into which his incomes are flowing, and the manner in which they have been utilised,” the Bench said. The estranged wife had filed a contempt petition before the High Court after her husband failed to comply with a December last year order of a Family Court here ordering him to pay Rs. 35,000 per month as an interim maintenance till the divorce case was settled. They got married in November 2013 and later filed for divorce in April 2018. The High Court, in February this year, further ordered the husband to comply with the interim maintenance order passed by the Family Court. Deliberate violation While hearing the contempt petition filed by the woman, the Bench observed that the man was guilty of intentionally and deliberately violating and not complying with the order passed by the Family Court and the High Court. It added, “If such action is permitted, it will lead to anarchy and the rule of law would become a casualty. The orders of the courts would be taken lightly and breached at the own will of the individual concerned”. The court, which also imposed a penalty of Rs. 2,000 on the man, noted that mere imposition of a fine would not meet the ends of justice, and that a sentence of imprisonment was necessary considering the fact that the arrears owed by him are far in excess of the fine imposed, and he has deliberately, wilfully, intentionally and defiantly disobeyed the directions issued to him. The Bench, however, said if the man exhibits his apology by complying with the orders passed by the courts, makes payment of entire arrears of maintenance within two weeks, undertakes to continue to pay the same during pendency of divorce case and tenders an unconditional apology to the court, it will consider recalling the punishment of him undergoing simple imprisonment. “However, in case, he does not comply with this direction in the next two weeks, he is directed to surrender before the Jail Superintendent, Central Jail, Tihar, on December 09, 2021,” the court ordered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/man-gets-3-months-jail-for-concealing-income/article37744883.ece
29 November 2021||New Delhi,||Residents of NDMC area can now get free water every month||Citizens residing in Lutyens’ Delhi too will now get 20,000 litres of free water every month after Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s intervention, the Delhi Government said on Sunday. Every house in B.K Dutt Colony will get a free water connection and the benefits under the free water scheme following the CM’s directions to waive metering charges. In addition, residents of East Kidwai Nagar and New Moti Bagh multi-storey complexes will receive personal water meters and there will be no need for bulk connections. Connaught Place, Janpath and rest of New Delhi will now be cleaned as per international standards, Mr. Kejriwal said, adding that the Government will also hear the grievances of all New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) employees and stakeholders pertaining to pay scales. A meeting of the NDMC was held under the leadership of Mr. Kejriwal on Sunday. B.K Dutt Colony was established as a refugee colony and the residents initially were dependent on common toilets. The Government said that new water pipelines were laid in the area about four years ago but a lot of residents still have not taken connections. The major reason behind this is the connection charges amounting to Rs. 7,500. “We can waive the connection charges and extend the benefits of the free water scheme to the residents,” he said. A proposal for bolstering cleanliness in the NDMC area was also presented in the meeting. Officials said despite being one of the cleanest sites of Delhi, the area has scope for improvement and some places do not get regular cleaning. “Connaught Place, Hanuman Mandir and Baba Kharak Singh Marg are famous all over the country. But the cleanliness here is not satisfactory. Mechanical sweeping can be an effective option. We have to ensure that the area gets cleaned as per the best international standards as it is the pride of our country,” the CM said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/residents-of-ndmc-area-can-now-get-free-water-every-month/article37744897.ece

He also asked the Education Minister to similarly release a list of 250 Government schools in his State so that the education model of Punjab could be studied and a debate could be held to decide which one was better. “It is a matter of great pride that education is finally becoming an important issue in the politics of the country. When Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that AAP would fix the decaying education system in Punjab, Education Minister Pargat Singh responded that the Punjab Government had worked a lot for education in that State,” Mr. Sisodia, who is also the Deputy Chief Minister, said. “Hence, he was invited to come with his team and media persons to visit five Government schools in Delhi and five Government schools in Punjab and then debate on the education model of both the States,” he added. Mr. Singh, however, wanted to visit 250 Government schools in Delhi. Mr. Sisodia said that the Delhi Government could even prepare a list of 1,000 schools. “When Mr. Singh visits these schools, he should bring media persons along so that the people of Punjab can witness the world class infrastructure and quality education at the Delhi Government schools and compare it with the education system in their State,” the Deputy CM said. World class infra He said that in the last five years, the Delhi Government had developed world class infrastructure in Government schools, provided leadership training to the school heads by institutions like IIMs, and sent teachers abroad for training. The result of which, he said, was that the Government schools had fared better than private schools, with 99.96% pass rate in Class XII exam this year. Around 500 children, including 51 students from one school, had qualified NEET while 500 children had cleared the JEE Mains and 70 students had qualified JEE Advanced. “We will also visit the schools in Punjab and then debate on the education model of both the States,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/sisodia-releases-list-of-250-delhi-govt-schools-for-punjab-ministers-scrutiny/article37744895.ece

29 November 2021||New Delhi,||Govt.’s war on pollution only on paper: BJP||The BJP on Sunday accused the Delhi Government of carrying out its war on pollution only on paper while citizens were being forced to breathe and drink “poisonous” air and water. Led by former Union Minister and ex-Delhi BJP president Vijay Goel and MLAs Mohan Singh Bisht and Om Prakash Sharma, the party staged a protest at the ITO intersection. “Mr. Kejriwal announced that he would clean the Yamuna by 2025. How many more years will he take to curb the pollution in Delhi? Till then the people will continue to drink dirty water,” Mr. Goel said. Mr. Kejriwal is constantly doing drama for everything, he said. “Firstly, in the name of fight against pollution, they put up placards in the hands of volunteers by paying them and posted them at different chowks in Delhi. Is this the way to tackle the pollution?” he asked. Mr. Goel said people will not follow a Chief Minister who is not serious about pollution. Mr. Kejriwal, he said, who used to blame stubble burning in Punjab for pollution in the city needs to answer why the situation remains the same despite no incidents of stubble burning. As much as 80% of the pollution in Delhi, he said, is contributed by factors such as dust, industrial pollution and one crore private vehicles.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/govts-war-on-pollution-only-on-paper-bjp/article37744891.ece

29 November 2021||Pune,||‘MVA Govt. turned crisis into opportunity’||Expressing satisfaction over the performance of the tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) Government, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday said it had successfully turned the “COVID-19 crisis into an opportunity”. In a statement to mark the completion of his two years in office, Mr. Thackeray, who is recuperating from a spine surgery, thanked the people for supporting his Government in all its endeavours and said it was a true “people’s Government”. Mr. Thackeray said most part of his Government’s two-year tenure was spent on COVID-19 management.  “We did not panic either during man-made or natural calamities and our focus remained on ensuring the welfare of the common public… There was no negativity in the Government or the administration while tackling the pandemic,” Mr. Thackeray said, adding that there was a vast difference between the medical facilities and the health infrastructure that existed before the pandemic and today. He further said that his three-party Government (of the Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party and the Congress) had worked hard to increase industrial investment, generate more employment and enhance the State’s agriculture infrastructure while focusing on ensuring better water supply and improving sanitation facilities. Sena MP and the party’s chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut mocked the BJP’s “general disorientation” during the two years that Mr. Thackeray-led Government had been in power in the State. ‘Failed attempts’ “It has now become a joke that the Opposition, which has not been able to overthrow the Government in the last two years, keeps giving new dates for toppling the MVA. The Thackeray Government has stood firm despite all efforts of the Opposition to discredit and malign it,” said Mr. Raut in his weekly column ‘Rokhthok’ in the Sena’s mouthpiece Saamna . “Allegations of corruption and malpractice have been levelled against the MVA leaders, while cases like Sushant Singh Rajput’s death have been politicised. This has followed the defamation of the Thackeray and Pawar families, intimidation of Sena MLAs and NCP leaders like former Home Minister Anil Deshmukh’s imprisonment… The BJP has not been able to bring down the Thackeray Government despite misusing Central agencies and inciting communal riots in Amravati and elsewhere,” Mr. Raut said, adding that what credit Devendra Fadnavis had formerly earned as Chief Minister was lost by him as the Leader of the Opposition. Taunting the BJP, the Sena MP noted that the early morning swearing-in of Mr. Fadnavis as the State’s Chief Minister in November 2019 (before the formation of the MVA Government) also completed two years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/mva-govt-turned-crisis-into-opportunity/article37744911.ece
29 November 2021||Pune,||Govt. can’t function in Uddhav’s continued absence, says Patil||The Maharashtra Government cannot keep functioning in the face of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray’s continuing absence, said BJP State president Chandrakant Patil while expressing dissatisfaction over no appointment of Speaker in the Assembly in 10 months. Mr. Thackeray, who has been recuperating following a cervical spine surgery, has been conducting business of the State virtually. The Chief Minister’s indisposition has sparked speculation of a possible change in the State’s leadership. ‘No way to function’ While refusing to directly comment on this, Mr. Patil said this was not the way in which the State Government ought to function. “While I pray for Mr. Thackeray’s speedy recovery, a State cannot be run in this fashion… He has not handed over his post to anyone else and the CM’s work has been stalled for the last 19 days. The Assembly has not had a Speaker for the last 10 months. That is not how the Government works,” said the BJP State chief. Stating that if a Chief Minister was unwell for even three days, the work ought to be handed over to a “caretaker”, Mr. Patil questioned why Mr. Thackeray was conducting the Cabinet virtually. “Why has the upcoming winter session of the State Legislature been curtailed to just five days? As it is, we have not had too many sessions owing to the pandemic. Why is the session not being held in Nagpur [traditional place of the winter session] but in Mumbai? Who will sign important papers?” he asked. Chastising the MVA government for its alleged failures in the last two years, Mr. Patil said the State administration had “completely collapsed”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/govt-cant-function-in-uddhavs-continued-absence-says-patil/article37744909.ece
29 November 2021||Ranchi,||Three detained in Jharkhand for attacking Kashmiri traders||The Jharkhand Police on Sunday said it has detained three persons who were a part of a group that forced some Kashmiri traders to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’ and ‘Pakistan Murdabad’ in State capital Ranchi. A 34-year-old man from Kashmir, who makes a living by selling winter clothes, lodged a complaint with the police on Saturday stating that a group of around 25 people attacked him and some other traders from the Union Territory in Ranchi’s Doranda area and forced them to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’ and ‘Pakistan Murdabad’. A purported video of Kashmiri traders complaining about the incident has been shared on Twitter. One of them is heard saying, “Is it a crime to be a Kashmiri. They have made our life hell here. Are we not Indians? They ask us always to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’ and ‘Pakistan Murdabad’. Four of us were beaten mercilessly...We are Indians and law is equal for all....There should be no discrimination.” Chief Minister Hemant Soren retweeted the link to the video and sought strict action against the culprits. “There is no place for religious enmity and discrimination in Jharkhand,” Mr. Soren said in the tweet.  ‘Probe underway’ Senior Superintendent of Police Surendra Kumar Jha said that an investigation into the case is underway. “We have detained three persons in connection with the incident. An investigation has been initiated into the matter and action will be taken against anyone found guilty,” he stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/3-detained-for-attacking-kashmiri-traders/article37744875.ece
29 November 2021||Rewa,||‘Rani Kamalapati was married to Muslim man’||Congress Rajya Sabha Member Rajmani Patel has claimed that “Rani Kamalapati was married to a Muslim man and that a railway station in the BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh was renamed after the Gond queen to mislead the people”. Earlier this month, while renaming the renovated Habibganj railway station in Bhopal after Rani Kamalapati, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had hailed her as the pride of the Gond community and “the last Hindu queen of Bhopal”. However, Mr. Patel, while talking to reporters here on Saturday, claimed that the tribal queen had befriended a Muslim commander and sought his help to attack (others), but later took “Jal Samadhi” after having a “love affair” with him. “The name of a station in Bhopal was changed to mislead the people. It was renamed after the last tribal queen (of Bhopal) Rani Kamalapati. The common people don’t know who Rani Kamalapati was? She was a tribal. She was married to a Muslim. Now, ask (Prime Minister) Modi ji if she was pure Hindu or pure Musalman,” he said. The Congress leader also accused the BJP of dividing society in the name of Hindu and Muslim and changing the history to seek votes. Asked if Rani Kamalapati was a Muslim, Mr. Patel said “let them (BJP) clarify”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/rani-kamalapati-was-married-to-muslim-man/article37744907.ece

MSRTC staffers have been on strike since October 28 and bus operations across its 250 depots state-wide have been affected from November 9, though friction is being witnessed among employees of late as some of them have begun to break ranks and return to work. A police official said Saturday’s stone pelting incident was also the result of this friction among staffers. “One driver returned to work on the Kalyan-Bhiwandi route on Saturday afternoon, which angered his colleague Vitthal Kehdkar, who threw a stone at the former’s bus in Kongaon area. The glass of the vehicle was damaged, though no one was injured,” the official said. Kehdkar was charged under IPC and Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act provisions for using criminal force to deter a public servant from carrying out his duties and endangering human life through a rash and negligent act, he said. Staffers of the loss-making MSRTC have been demanding its takeover by the State government, which will give employees better salaries and greater job security.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/msrtc-agitation-driver-held-for-throwing-stone-at-bus/article37745119.ece
29 November 2021||TIRUPATTUR,||Yelagiri Hills in T.N. off limits for unvaccinated visitors||The scenic Yelagiri Hills are now out of bounds for those who haven’t been vaccinated against COVID-19. The Tirupattur administration has made it mandatory for visitors to the hill station to have taken both doses of the vaccine. A special help desk comprising a team of police personnel and district health officials has been set up on the foothills of the Yelagiri Hills, 12 km away from the hillock, to check the vaccination certificates provided by the visitors. The help desk will be open from 6 a.m to 6 p.m. “The aim is to encourage everyone to take the vaccine, especially the second dose. Door-to-door visits for vaccination are also being carried out to cover all tribal villages on the hillock,” an official said. The hill station is getting a facelift to draw more tourists from neighbouring areas like Krishnagiri, Vellore, Tiruvannamalai and Hosur. Boathouses are being readied for long-distance travellers, especially those from Chennai and Bengaluru. The boat complex has about 15 fibre boats with a capacity of six persons each. Among the measures being taken are the setting up of more recreational facilities like an open-air stadium, separate parks for fruits, flowers and herbal plants and a botanical garden.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/yelagiri-hills-in-tn-off-limits-for-unvaccinated-visitors/article37744903.ece

The Defence Ministry said Taiwan scrambled combat aircraft to “warn” the Chinese planes to leave. It also deployed missile systems to monitor them. Sunday’s incursion included 18 fighter jets and five H-6 bombers, as well as a Y-20 aerial refueling aircraft, according to Taiwan’s Defence Ministry. The Chinese aircraft flew into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ) near the southern part of the island and out into the Pacific Ocean before returning to China, according to a map by Taiwan authorities. Over the past year, the frequency of Chinese incursions has increased, with about 150 aircraft over a period of four days. China’s latest mission came as Chinese President Xi Jinping met with top officers at a military conference, where he called for military talent cultivation to support and strengthen the armed forces, according to state-owned news agency Xinhua.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/27-chinese-jets-enter-taiwan-adiz/article37744480.ece
29 November 2021||Vienna,||Protests erupt in Austria over compulsory vaccination||Tens of thousands of Austrians rallied this weekend to protest against the government’s introduction of compulsory vaccination — the first EU country to do so — as the Chancellor insisted on Sunday that the move would represent “a minor interference” compared to the alternatives. One of the largest demonstrations was held in the southern city of Graz, where police said late Saturday that around 25,000 people had gathered in a rally that remained mostly peaceful. But police said that three men in their early 20s were being investigated for allegedly making Nazi salutes and that there were dozens of infractions against virus-related rules on mask-wearing. In an interview with the Italian daily, Corriere della Sera, Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said that the government had “sadly” been forced to turn to compulsory vaccination to bolster the current rate of full vaccination — which currently stands at just under 67% and is one of the lowest in Western Europe. With the current rate “we will never get out of the vicious circle of new waves and new debates on lockdowns,” he said. “Every lockdown is a heavy interference in fundamental rights. Compared to that, compulsory vaccination is a minor interference,” he said. Faced with rapidly rising case numbers, the government introduced a partial lockdown on Monday, although schools have remained open. Other demonstrations on Saturday took place in the cities of Sankt Poelten and Klagenfurt, attracting around 3,500 and 5,000 people respectively. Eleven arrests were made in Sankt Poelten, most of them for “aggressive behaviour”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/protests-in-austria-over-compulsory-vaccination/article37744482.ece
29 November 2021||London,||U.K. seeks ‘urgent’ migrant talks with Europe after French snub||Britain’s government on Sunday announced plans for its own talks on the Channel migration crisis with European Ministers this week as it was frozen out of a crisis meeting in France. Home Secretary Priti Patel was barred from Sunday’s meeting in Calais, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson published the text of a letter to French President Emmanuel Macron setting out London’s demands for concerted action. But following the tragic drownings of 27 people in the Channel last Wednesday, she tweeted: “I will be holding urgent talks with my European counterparts this week to prevent further tragedies in the Channel.” There was no immediate comment from Ms. Patel’s Interior Ministry on the venue or timing of the talks. But Ms. Patel used a commentary piece in the Sun on Sunday newspaper to spell out the need for joint action, and for tougher U.K. legislation, as she comes under pressure in right-wing media and from her own Conservative party to get a grip on the crisis. “There is still so much more we can do and I am sorry not to be at a meeting with European ministerial counterparts today to discuss this pressing issue,” she wrote in the tabloid. “We need to be creative about finding new solutions that will have the maximum possible impact, which is why the prime minister and I stand ready to discuss proposals with our French counterparts at any time,” Ms. Patel said. “And I know from my discussions with my European partners in recent days and weeks that there is more that can be done. Together, we can break up the people-smuggling gangs and save lives -- but we must act now.” Ministers from France, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium met in the French port of Calais on Sunday, following the deaths of the 27 Iraqi Kurds and others as they attempted to cross from France to England in a fragile dinghy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/uk-seeks-urgent-migrant-talks-with-europe-after-french-snub/article37744484.ece
29 November 2021||Reykjavik,||Iceland’s ruling coalition agrees on another term||Iceland’s outgoing left-right coalition government said Sunday it had reached a deal to continue together in power for four more years, more than two months after winning a majority in a general election. Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir of the Left Green Movement will continue to head the government, the parties said. The Left-Green Movement, the conservative Independence Party and the centre-right Progressive Party together won 38 of the 63 seats in Parliament in the September vote, up from the 33 they had held since the previous election in 2017. The unusual alliance — which has earned Ms. Jakobsdottir some criticism and saw her party emerge weakened from the election — has brought Iceland four years of stability after a decade of political crises. This is the first time since 2003 that an outgoing government has held on to its majority in an election. “It has been complicated for the past four years and it will continue to be complicated. But maybe it is also healthy having to work with people who don’t agree with you on everything,” Ms. Jakobsdottir said. Clear majority “The message from the parliamentary election was very clear, giving the government a clear majority,” she added. Her Left-Green Movement won only eight seats, three fewer than in 2017, losing ground to its right-wing partners, which both posted strong showings. While Ms. Jakobsdottir’s holds on to the post of PM, her party lost control of the environment and health ministries. Meanwhile the largest party, the Independence Party, retains the finance, foreign affairs and justice portfolios, and took on those for environment and industry as well. The Progressive Party will head the health, education, and trade and culture ministries, as well a new portfolio for infrastructure grouping together transport, housing and urbanisation issues. The lengthy negotiations to form the new government were attributed to ideological divisions between the Left Greens and the Independence Party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/icelands-ruling-coalition-agrees-on-another-term/article37744474.ece
29 November 2021||Vienna,||Iran nuclear talks set to resume after five months||The international talks in Vienna to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, will take place on Monday afternoon after a five-month hiatus, a diplomatic source said. The talks between the remaining partners to the deal — Iran, China, Russia, Germany, France and the U.K. — will restart at around two pm local time (1300 GMT), the European diplomat said on Sunday. The U.S. will also send a delegation, headed by Washington’s Special Envoy for Iran, Rob Malley, which will participate in the talks indirectly. Russia’s Ambassador to the UN in Vienna Mikhail Ulyanov had said this week that “informal meetings” between the participants were expected ahead of the formal talks beginning in the Austrian capital’s Palais Coburg hotel.

While the quake was extremely strong, it was relatively deep — measured at 112km — which usually reduces the possibility of damage and casualties. The quake occurred at 5:52 a.m. (1052 GMT) and its epicenter was in the Amazon region. It had a magnitude of 7.5, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Part of a 16th century church in La Jalca district in the Amazon region collapsed and three people were lightly injured, Mayor Walter Culqui told Peru’s RPP radio. Falling stones blocked several highways in the Amazonas and Cajamarca regions in Peru, and the tremor was felt nearly 800 km away in the capital of Lima, where some people rushed out of their homes in alarm. A church in the Loja municipality in neighboring Ecuador was also partly damaged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/magnitude-75-quake-strikes-northern-peru/article37744485.ece

29 November 2021||November 29 2021 00:00 IST,||What the Omicron variant means for India||The continued decline in COVID-19 cases following the intense second wave in India has led to hope that a return to normalcy might be near. Across the country, emboldened by the fact that the festival season did not lead to a steep rise in cases, restrictions have eased and public behaviour is largely returning to normal. Situation now The low number of cases currently in India, even as cases are rising across much of Europe, appears largely attributable to two factors. First, seroprevalence studies indicate that a large proportion of the population has already been exposed to the virus providing some level of protection to subsequent infections. Second, the immunisation campaign has gained momentum. Approximately 44% of Indian adults have been fully vaccinated and 82%  have received at least one dose. What is more, scientists believe that prior infection followed by one or two doses of vaccination may have a larger protective effect than two doses of the vaccination alone. While vaccine-derived protection against symptomatic infection is expected to decay with time, current research suggests that breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated individuals are reduced in intensity and duration, compared to cases in individuals who have not been vaccinated. This holds for the Delta variant as well. Other variants have raised concerns but none of them has appeared to be significantly more worrying than the Delta variant, at least until now. What WHO says A new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was recently identified in Botswana. Called the Omicron variant, early evidence suggests that it may be responsible for the steep rise of cases in the Gauteng province of South Africa. In this region, 90% of samples from the past few weeks have been of the Omicron variant. This variant has a large number of mutations. Some of them are cause for serious concern because they may allow the new variant to evade immunity obtained from a past infection or via a vaccine. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently labelled this variant as a ‘variant of concern’. While the emergence of the new variant is concerning and requires extreme vigilance, there are several questions that remain unanswered at the moment. Is the variant more transmissible? Can it evade the immune system? And is the variant associated with more severe disease outcomes? The possibility of a new, more transmissible variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has, of course, been the principal worry of epidemiologists. Some other recent variants, with a more limited repertoire of mutations, have raised concerns briefly, but have not risen to the level of being named a variant of concern so far. What is concerning here is that cases of the new variant have risen so sharply as to suggest that it may far outstrip the Delta variant in its ability to infect people. There are no reliable estimates of just how much more transmissible the Omicron variant is compared to previous strains of the virus. But even crude calculations suggest it could be much larger than for those strains. When new variants can evade immunity obtained through immunisation and prior infections, there is a greater chance for breakthrough cases and further transmission. WHO has recommended studies to understand the degree to which the immune system is evaded by the Omicron variant. This is a key question for India given the high proportion of individuals with some level of immunity, mostly from infection. If these mutations do lead to greater immune escape, vaccines and treatments like monoclonal antibodies might need to be reformulated. Luckily, RT-PCR tests should still detect the Omicron variant. Addressing the variant Right now, we know very little about whether the Omicron variant might lead to more severe forms of COVID-19, both in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. This is clearly a priority for research. Evidence related to increased severity associated with other variants, such as the Delta variant, remains largely inconclusive. Where did the Omicron variant come from? Viruses mutate all the time and SARS-CoV-2 is no exception. What is unusual is the very large number of mutations that the Omicron variant has accumulated. This is likely a consequence of a chronic infection in an immunocompromised patient, such as one infected with HIV. A strong immune response can ultimately eliminate the virus. However, in a weakened immune system the virus will continue to multiply and mutate, changing its form to evade immune response. Given this, prioritising the elderly and immunocompromised for a future additional dose would make sense. While a number of nations have already closed their doors to travellers from South Africa, epidemiologists worldwide recognise that these measures can only offer temporary relief. Given that a case was found in Hong Kong in a traveller from South Africa a full four days into a mandatory quarantine, and that this patient may have infected another individual who turned positive some days later, it seems very likely that cases may have already crossed borders without being detected. Israel has also reported cases, with one of them, a 32-year-old woman, already triple vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine before testing positive. The symptoms in this case were mild. Promote vaccination As long as the virus circulates, the possibility remains that new variants could emerge. The best option is to reduce case numbers. For this, vaccination is an especially powerful tool. Even a single dose of vaccine can reduce dramatically the risk of hospitalisation or a worse outcome; two doses do even better. However, the current inequity in vaccine distribution means that this means of control is out of reach of most in lower and middle-income countries. While many rich countries are now arranging for booster doses to safeguard their populations, even younger and less vulnerable individuals, this policy comes at the cost of the rest of the world, where vaccine coverage remains abysmally low. More than 60 countries have vaccinated less than 25% of their population, including South Africa. It is these regions that hold the most potential for a new, more transmissible variant. Equity in the distribution of vaccines is an urgent global public health need, quite apart from being ethically and morally the right thing to do. The Director of the Wellcome Trust, Sir Jeremy Farrar, has in a tweet, said, “South Africa needs to be praised, offered whatever support is needed and acknowledged for the quality of speed of public health and genomic science in South Africa, sharing the data immediately, supporting the region and the world....” We concur and urge that India and other countries should learn from the South African experience, making its data available in real time for the world to study, and exhibiting the highest levels of transparency. At present, we do not know enough about the variant to truly understand the potential risk that it might pose, but — as with all such things — preparing adequately for an uncertain future is key.

29 November 2021||November 29 2021 00:00 IST,||How to win over Kashmiri youth||Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) has been on the boil since Independence. Several solutions to the problem of militancy have been put forth. Recently, there was a suggestion that de-radicalisation camps should be organised for the youth. Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat said that it is a “positive sign” that the people in Kashmir are now saying they will “lynch terrorists”. Before we talk about why a soft touch is required to win over the Kashmiri youth, let us look at the history of radicalisation in Kashmir. Religion in state craft The process of using religious overtones in state craft was initiated by General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, the dictator-President of Pakistan. He stressed that religion should be part of state policy. It is anybody’s guess whether he tried to make Pakistan an Islamic state due to politics or piety or both, but the fact is that the proliferation of Madrasas started during his time and have contributed immensely to the Islamisation and radicalisation of Pakistani youth. This later on spilled over into Kashmir as part of low-intensity conflict operations (LICO). From 1989, insurgents, whose aim was the secession of J&K from India, began to use violent means to achieve their goal. This led to strong counter-insurgency operations. It was the beginning of the dividing line between Kashmiris and the rest of India. The Public Safety Act of 1978 and the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act of 1958 were used to counter militancy. Those were harsh times and warranted harsh rebuttals. Back then, militants were sent to Kashmir from Pakistan; the local youth were not involved in militancy. Hundreds of tanzeems (groups) were created in Pakistan to fight in Afghanistan. Some of these were then deployed in J&K. Pakistani agents moved around recruiting youth to train in Pakistan in the name of Islam and freedom for Kashmir. From the 1990s, militancy increased and then peaked in J&K. Due to threats from terrorist leaders, many Kashmiri families sent one of their sons to be trained in Pakistan and then to be deployed in Kashmir. Governor’s rule remained in J&K for a long time keeping the democratic process at bay. When the due process of elections was brought back, the same Abdullah family from the Jammu and Kashmir People’s Conference and the Mufti family from the Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party became the leaders. But these leaders could not gain the full trust of the people. Kashmir began to see home-grown militancy during the 2008 protests due to the State elections and then following the 2010 killing of three infiltrators by the Indian Army. The All Parties Hurriyat Conference called for violent protests which resulted in riots, burning of government vehicles and ‘stone-pelting incidents’. The situation on the ground changed for the worse with the birth of home-grown militancy. There were now twin challenges for the Army, the Central Armed Police Forces and the J&K Police. The first were the terrorists for whom the rules of engagement were different and the second were the Kashmiri youth who formed the bulk of the protestors — Indians for whom all the rules and laws applicable to any Indian citizen apply. When stone-pelting incidents took a serious and alarming turn, armed personnel responded with pellet guns and other means of riot control. Injuries, especially eye injuries, were a serious fallout of this response. According to the United Nations Report on Children 2021, a total of 39 children (33 boys, six girls) were killed (nine) and maimed (30) by pellet guns (11) and torture (two)...”. The Mufti government announced in January 2018 that 6,221 people had suffered pellet-gun injuries during the unrest in Kashmir after the killing of the Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist, Burhan Wani, in 2016. Unacceptable suggestions The suggestion that terrorists must be lynched is not a good idea as a vigilante approach in a democratic country is not acceptable. De-radicalisation camps for the youth have been conducted many times in a different, toned-down manner. In August this year, for instance, the Indian Army announced that it would subsidise undergraduate courses and school education to selected children and youth from J&K and Ladakh in residential schools and professional colleges functioning under the Army Welfare Education Society, as part of Operation Sadbhavana. In August 2018, the J&K Police organised a Bharat Darshan tour to Delhi and Agra for students to “provide them [the] opportunity to understand history and development of other parts of country”. The Border Security Force (BSF) has been organising such programmes since 1999-2000. Till date, 1,539 children from J&K have participated in 55 BSF-sponsored Bharat Darshan tours, according to the Union Home Ministry. The Army has also been assisting in the construction of schools, medical aid, veterinary care and disaster relief. However, these measures have not had the desired effect as most of the youth selected are not from the militancy-prone regions. Protecting Kashmiris Kashmiri children in schools and colleges outside the State are often mistreated when any misadventure takes place in J&K. The incidents of violence against minorities, including Muslims, in north India have only worsened their problems. One cannot love Kashmiri Muslims in J&K and hate them elsewhere. The Kashmiri youth feel that they face hostility from the Indian state because of their Muslim identity and so the status quo cannot be effective. The suggestion of de-radicalisation camps for the youth can appear similar to the detention camps run by China for Muslim minorities. This suggestion will be exploited for political gains by the pro-Pakistani elements and further vitiate the atmosphere. The administration has to provide protection to the Kashmiri youth when they are studying elsewhere in India. It is important for the Kashmiri youth, where ever they are, feel at home. This needs a real professional approach, a soft touch and long-term efforts. Otherwise, generation after generation will continue fighting their own country, India. Lt. General Naresh Chand (Retd.) is an army veteran of four decades, who served in Kashmir at the height of the militancy in the early nineties||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/how-to-win-over-kashmiri-youth/article37744473.ece
29 November 2021||November 29 2021 00:00 IST,||COP26 pledges need a new climate of cooperation||As world leaders converged in Glasgow for the COP26 (October 31-November 12, 2021), there were some notable absentees. The Presidents of China and Russia, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, leaders of the world’s second and fourth largest carbon emitters, failed to make it to Glasgow. Hence, understandably, all eyes fell upon India, the world’s third largest carbon emitter, and which included what kind of commitment Prime Minister Narendra Modi would be making. There was cautious optimism when India finally announced its net zero target, even though India’s pledged deadline is 2070 – two decades after than the desired deadline of the year 2050. After the net zero target, the United States and Europe led the next biggest climate goal, the Global Methane Pledge, to bring down global methane levels significantly by 2030; this was signed by as many as 104 countries. Despite being the third-largest methane emitter, India was not signatory. India also was not part of the pledge to deforestation despite hosting the world’s largest contiguous mangrove forest: the Sundarbans. Pursuing green energy India has been a promoter of green energy to reduce carbon emission. Although the country is yet to significantly transit to renewable energy, accounting only 22.5% of nationwide electricity production, India has been leading the global movement towards solar power. The country cofounded the International Solar Alliance (ISA) along with France – an alliance with more than 120 countries to promote solar energy. To strengthen India’s stand for renewable energy like solar energy, India has signed to the Glasgow Breakthrough Agenda in this year’s COP26 along with over 35 other nations to promote clean energy and make it more affordable. Compared to China’s 28.4%, the U.S.’s 19.8% and some North European country’s 100% transition to renewable energy for power, there is much room for improvement in India. However, there are two key struggles that India has to deal with when transitioning to green energy: the consumption of the world’s second largest population base and the lack of adequate available renewable energy options. Countries such as Iceland and Norway have the privilege to depend almost entirely on hydroelectricity adequate enough for a small population such as theirs. Countries with a similar population scale to India such as China and the U.S. have been relying significantly on nuclear power to cut down on carbon emissions which India cannot facilitate due to not being a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. India did commit to transiting to green energy for meeting at least half of nation-wide power consumptions. However, the country requires significant measures to do so, which includes bringing down the cost of renewable energy to make it more affordable and attractive to the general public and private businesses. The Indian government has been promoting green energy to abide by its COP21 climate commitments. The Government plans to make wide use of hydrogen fuel as a better substitute of fossil fuels and is promoting renewable energy such as solar powered energy production by reducing tariffs and even providing for subsidising which are falling. The Indian renewable energy industry is up against an immense financial challenge with a recent report estimating the requirement of Rs. 2.61 trillion to install a balance capacity to achieve its target of 175 gigawatts of renewable power by the year 2022. Difficult choices for the South India has faced numerous economic adversities in recent years. The country is still reeling from the impact of demonetisation in 2016 that left GDP growth rate falling ever since. Foreign investment in India has also been declining since 2018. The COVID-19 pandemic that hit in early 2020 further pushed down GDP growth, severely impacting several industries. Scarce resources are being used for economic survival. The Government is desperately trying to aid its economy by subsidising various industries during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as vaccinating its population to prevent another wave as worse as the COVID-19 Delta variant wave that had hit India earlier. The country is going through a resource constraint, having to choose between priorities. Meeting climate goals with a population of 1.3 billion while combating the novel coronavirus pandemic has been a challenge for the world’s largest democracy. India does not have privilege like its peers from the developed world to financially support all of its economy, people and the climate. It is no surprise that Mr. Modi had to ask the international community for a new financial commitment to achieve the climate goals. More so, since the annual $100 billion pledge by developed countries to the developing countries and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) back in COP16 is yet to be disbursed. If powerful developing economies such as India are to play a constructive role in tackling climate change and achieving net zero target, the developed North needs to shore up its support by taking a common responsibility to help developing countries and LDCs to pursue climate goals as they already face the daunting tasks of fighting poverty, providing basic health-care services, and ensuring access to education. People without food when they are hungry, medicine and doctors when they are ill, and schools for their children cannot be expected to either relate or appreciate the adversities of climate change being debated in a place and country which most of them have not even heard of and leaders they hardly know.

29 November 2021||November 29 2021 00:00 IST,||In pursuit of social justice||The recently launched educational programme of the Tamil Nadu government, Illam Thedi Kalvi (Education at the Doorsteps), triggered mixed reactions. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) government launched this programme as it recognises the pandemic-induced gap in learning among schoolchildren. The lockdown disempowered children from the marginalised sections as they did not have access to technology-driven pedagogical methods as the privileged did. Many who find online teaching convenient and safe fail to recognise this class bias. The expensive nature of online teaching pushed a large number of underprivileged children out of the education system. The lockdown thus accentuated the asymmetrical structure of the school system. Objectives of the programme Many incentives provided by the state, including free textbooks, free uniforms, free bicycles and nutritious mid-day meals, were unavailable to children of vulnerable sections during the lockdown. Their parents’ loss of livelihood compelled these children to drop out of school and resulted in increasing cases of child labour. This crisis steadily began to wreck a celebrated political value in Tamil Nadu and an enduring legacy of the Dravidian movement — social justice. Launching this programme is the government’s attempt to achieve social justice. This policy will be implemented by volunteers first in 12 districts. It will be launched in other districts when the results from the 12 districts are positive. Some 68,000 of the 86,000 volunteers are women. This is quite encouraging as it could allay fears about the safety of female students and encourage them to participate in the programme. Otherwise, many may be compelled to become child labourers or domestic help. Allotting Rs. 200 crore for the programme is a welcome move especially since the Union government slashed the total education budget this year. Though Tamil Nadu is among the most literate States, learning outcomes in have been a cause of concern. Nearly 59% of Class 5 students and 89% of Class 3 students were unable to read a Class 2-level textbook in rural Tamil Nadu, according to the Annual Status of Educational Report (2018). Tamil Nadu got the lowest score among the southern States in ‘learning outcomes and quality’ in the Performance Grading Index of the Union Education Ministry. Keeping these facts in mind, volunteers of this programme intend to improve learning outcomes. The idea is to do this outside school hours and away from the school premises in a comfortable and easily accessible location close to the child’s home. The volunteers will teach an estimated 34.05 lakh children in the 5-13 age group in 93,000 neighbourhoods for 60 to 90 minutes between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. Volunteers who have completed Class 12 will impart lessons for children of Classes 1-5 and graduates will teach children from Classes 6-8. They will refer to textbooks prepared by the State textbook council. Creative pedagogical initiatives including activity-based learning will ensure positive outcomes. Towards Paulo Freire’s vision It is commendable that experienced teachers and civic and education department officials will be monitoring the progress of the students at the district and block levels. By providing a concrete role to school management committees and community development activists, the programme is turning learning into a social engagement. The fact that a volunteer who has completed Class 12 becomes an instructor will challenge the inherent power dynamics between teachers and students. When young volunteers impart lessons creatively in an unconventional atmosphere, the possibility of better learning outcomes is higher. This also gives children an opportunity to develop a critical understanding of their social reality. This will enhance their self-respect and help them probe the reasons for oppression and injustice. This programme is an example of Paulo Freire’s vision through ‘conscientization’. A few allies of the DMK say that there is a possibility of communal elements using the programme for their own interests. However, this well-thought-out programme will prevent regressive political elements from usurping it. But having said that, there should be strong and credible institutional mechanisms to prevent any violation of girl children’s dignity as classes are going to be conducted outside the school premises by volunteers whose antecedents are not fully known to the parents and children. Though the large participation of women volunteers will dispel this fear, critiques could use this point to dent the programme’s success.

29 November 2021||November 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Scale up supplies||A new Greek tragedy has risen with the World Health Organization (WHO) designating Omicron, a SARS-CoV-2 variant, as a ‘variant of concern’ (VOC). While it took WHO several weeks to designate older VOCs such as Alpha, Beta and Delta as a VOC when they emerged, in the case of Omicron, which was first confirmed in Botswana, it moved without even waiting for reports on the variant’s increased likelihood to cause disease and whether it is denting the normal public health response. Omicron has now been confirmed in South Africa, Botswana, the U.K., Germany, Italy and travellers into the Netherlands and Israel. It reportedly has over 50 mutations, 32 of which are on the spike protein, which binds to human cells and is the preferred target for vaccines. Several of the mutations confer the virus resistance to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) such as etesevimab, bamlanivimab, casirivimab and their combinations. Antibodies are the first line of defence against viral infection and mAbs are used in treatment. However, it is important to emphasise that every single mutation does not independently increase virulence and combinations of them might sometimes temper, and sometimes aggravate, virus properties. The virus has been detected in comparable numbers only in South Africa’s Gauteng province, but the variant comprises over 90% of the fraction of genomes from those who tested positive there within just 10 days. Some nations have already imposed travel bans on flights from South Africa. Given that Omicron is a variant of the virus that can be detected by the PCR test, these countries, rather than imposing a ban, should have taken the more considered step of screening passengers and followed the usual protocols of isolation and treatment. India has done well so far to adhere to this system and observing caution. Detecting a variant in a country does not imply it originated there. Travel bans punish South Africa for its transparency and forthrightness in alerting the world to this variant. South Africa’s number of daily infections — 2,828 on Friday — pales in comparison to daily numbers in the United States, Germany and Britain. However, a little over 10% in Africa have received one dose of a vaccine, compared with 64% in North America and 62% in Europe. The panic over the variant shifts blame away from the world’s colossal failure in not making more vaccines available in Africa even as many countries roll out third doses. From day one, the science was clear cut that the pandemic cannot end unless the whole world is protected. India must scale up supplies to COVAX, the international consortium seeking to vaccinate countries with limited access, as well as coax countries with surplus stocks to do so.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/scale-up-supplies/article37744456.ece
29 November 2021||November 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Questionable criterion||The questions raised by the Supreme Court of India about the criteria for identifying the ‘Economically Weaker Sections’ (EWS) for the purpose of granting reservation are quite apposite. Faced with sharp questions that it could not answer satisfactorily, the Union government has obtained time to reconsider the criteria, especially the income norm that only those from a family with annual income less than Rs. 8 lakh can avail of the 10% reservation earmarked for the EWS category. It is now a settled principle that quantifiable data or proof of a detailed study are required to justify any category of reservation, as well as the norms that determine which section gets it and which does not. In this backdrop, it is logical that the Court would want to know whether there was any study before the Centre prescribed the norms for identifying EWS beneficiaries based on indicators of economic disadvantage. The enquiry by the three-judge Bench is necessarily circumscribed by the fact that the validity of the 103rd Constitution Amendment, through which the EWS quota was introduced in 2019, is before a Constitution Bench. In the ongoing proceedings, the Bench is considering the validity of the 27% quota for Other Backward Classes (OBC) and 10% for Economically Weaker Sections introduced for admission to the All-India Quota (AIQ) of seats in medical admissions throughout the country. It has clarified that it is not examining any policy issue, but wants to determine if constitutional requirements have been complied with. The income criterion is undoubtedly an anomalous aspect of the EWS quota. An annual income of Rs. 8 lakh is the limit beyond which an OBC family would fall under the ‘creamy layer’ and will be denied reservation. The same income figure is being used as the ceiling for identifying EWS. The moot question is whether those who do not face the impediments that come with social and educational backwardness can be equated with those who do. However, the current proceeding will only decide the validity of OBC and EWS reservation in admissions under the AIQ. It must be noted that the introduction of OBC quota in AIQ only brings the admission norms in line with prevailing policy. OBC reservation is applicable to admissions done separately by the Union and State governments in their respective medical institutions, but it was not implemented all these years for all-India quota seats. This pool is formed by the surrender of 15% of undergraduate seats and 50% of PG seats by the States. The absence of OBC quota in this category was an anomaly that has now been rectified. The larger issue that remains is whether reservation can be treated as a poverty alleviation measure and those not well-off but belonging to socially advanced communities can be given a share of the reservation pie. The Constitution Bench should resolve this question early.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/questionable-criterion/article37744457.ece
29 November 2021||November 29 2021 00:00 IST,||The importance of local language||For several decades, successive governments in Karnataka have attempted to make it mandatory for students to learn Kannada as a subject. Such attempts have met with opposition from some quarters and long-drawn legal battles. Government orders The issue has again come to the fore with the government issuing an order (GO) in August 2021 stating that undergraduate students should learn Kannada as one of the two languages from the 2021-2022 academic year. The State government has argued that this is in line with the National Education Policy (NEP) of 2020, which states that “in order to preserve and promote culture, one must preserve and promote a culture’s languages”. It also states that learning Indian languages needs to be integrated into the school and higher education at every level. After several stakeholders pointed out that students from other countries, States or those who have studied in Karnataka but not Kannada in school may find it challenging to learn the language, the State government issued a modified order. It said that such students will have to learn Kannada as a “functional language” for only one semester, while those who learned Kannada in school will have to study it for two years. However, this matter is now before the Karnataka High Court, with the Samskrita Bharati (Karnataka) Trust and three other institutions challenging the GOs. They have argued that the NEP does not specify any mandatory language for higher education, and that the GOs take away the choice-based credit system offered in the NEP to promote inclusivity and access. Karnataka’s Higher Education Department points out that the move only helps students in their day-to-day communication. Such a system has already been implemented successfully in engineering and medical colleges. Although students of professional courses initially showed some resistance, they were convinced to learn functional Kannada, which has proved beneficial. A brief history Karnataka has had a chequered history as far as language learning is concerned. The State government faced a setback after its language policy of 1994 was quashed by the Supreme Court in May 2014. The language policy mandated that the medium of instruction for students in lower primary classes should be in the regional language or mother tongue. After this battle was lost, the State government introduced the Kannada Language Learning Act, 2015, which states that either the first or second language for students in schools should be Kannada. Most schools have begun teaching Kannada as a subject, though some affiliated to the central boards do so only as a third language. The biggest movement to promote Kannada learning dates back to the 1980s, when the Gokak Committee submitted its report in 1981 that recommended, among other things, introducing Kannada in schools and giving it primacy. The delay in implementing this sparked off a major movement, which still resonates with many. The State government has used some pointers from this report in the current context as well, to argue that promoting the regional language cannot be seen as imposition. It has also cited provisions of the NEP to argue that the State can have a say in the choice of one of the languages. The choice to pick another language rests with the student. In fact, a student can opt for yet another language under the open electives category. It is not unreasonable to argue that learning the local language would help students feel a sense of belonging and communicate better. However, a lot now hangs on the outcome of the pending case in the Karnataka High Court. tanu.kulkarni@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-importance-of-local-language/article37744470.ece
29 November 2021||November 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Swiss thinking on joining U.N.||Berne, Nov. 28: The Swiss Government plans to set up a special committee to recommend whether this neutral country should finally join the United Nations. Government officials said the nation’s seven-member Cabinet stated its intention to set up the consultative committee in a 100-page report on Swiss-U.N. relations over the past two years. The report will be presented to Parliament here early in December. Although Switzerland has stayed out of the U.N., it is a member of several specialised U.N. agencies, including the International Labour Organisation and the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. The U.N.’s European headquarters is in a Swiss city — Geneva — as are the head offices of the several of the world organisation’s agencies. Switzerland’s neutrality has prevented it from applying for full membership of the European Economic Community (E.E.C.) though it was a founder member of the more purely commercial European Free Trade Association (E.F.T.A.). After exploratory talks earlier this year, Switzerland and the E.E.C. are soon to begin formal negotiations on special trading arrangements between them. At the same Cabinet meeting which approved the text of the U.N. report, the seven Ministers unanimously agreed that Swiss relations with the E.E.C. should be given priority over the question.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/swiss-thinking-on-joining-un/article37744465.ece
29 November 2021||November 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Watch out for fake motor insurance policies||Most known insurance frauds are usually about the insurance company being defrauded by customers. Saying a white lie about your high blood pressure in a health insurance proposal form, or allowing your garage to exaggerate the accident damage to your car in the claim form are common unethical practices. The insurance industry has suffered because of it and it comes back to roost as higher premium rates for everybody in the long run. Fraudulent documentation, misrepresentation of material facts, inflated claims, fake claims and moral hazard — the act of buying insurance under false pretences in order to make a claim — are well-known insurance frauds. More complicated frauds involve buying multiple policies on the same property, which is then destroyed for making a claim, policies being taken on non-existent properties or over-valuation of a property for enabling a higher cover and hence a higher claim. In this column, let us see examples of a different type of fraud. How you, the insured, can be defrauded, or used to perpetrate fraud on an insurance company. Recently a State police department exposed a fake motor insurance racket. Members of the public are contacted by a call centre claiming to be, or to be representing prominent insurers, and offered motor and health insurance. Premium is collected and fake policies are issued, leading to a double whammy for the ‘insured’ who has lost his money to a fraudster and is saddled with a worthless policy. Even more interesting is a case where mobile pollution testing centres were selling fake insurance policies to customers who approached them for a ‘Pollution Under Control’ certificate. A valid vehicle insurance policy is required for getting a PUC certificate, which is a must-have. So, the fake insurance is foisted easily on the customer in a moment of expediency, when he is unlikely to verify the genuineness of the transaction. Another kind of fraud that came to light was online insurance policy documents issued for motor third-party liability cover for a commercial vehicle, but at much lower rates by misrepresenting the category of vehicle. Misrepresenting category This ‘policy’, which has correct vehicle details like registration number, except for the category of vehicle, is issued in connivance with the customer, who can use it to show he has complied with the Motor Vehicles Act and has a TP cover. This will help him/her obtain a fitness certificate as the Road Transport Autority (RTA) systems are not linked to insurance and hence the policy cannot be authenticated. A routine check by the traffic police can easily be handled with this document, but would be useless if one tries to make a claim on it. The repercussions are terrible here as the actual victim would be somebody else who was hit by this ‘insured’ vehicle. Claims can be made only by or on behalf of the third party, who is affected (by way of injury, death or property damage) by the vehicle and there would be no linked insurance documents to make a claim on. We have seen just a few types of frauds involving motor insurance that you have to watch out for. There are vulnerabilities in health insurance and even life insurance that border on identity theft. We will see them in subsequent columns, including how to keep yourself safe from them and to avoid aiding and abetting criminals even if used unwittingly.

29 November 2021||KANPUR,||Shreyas, Ashwin and Saha help India turn the tables on the Kiwis||In a remarkable display of resilience, India eluded New Zealand’s grip and moved into a position from where it has a day to tighten the noose and win the first Test. On Sunday, when India’s fortunes swung from a desperate fight for survival at 51 for five to the luxury of declaring the innings at 234 for seven, New Zealand found itself in a serious spot of bother. At four for one, New Zealand needs another 280 with nine wickets in hand. With run-making looking increasingly challenging on the Green Park pitch, it is ‘Advantage India’. Paying the price As though the task of chasing 284 was not tough enough, New Zealand opener Will Young paid the price for the delay in asking for review of a dubious leg-before verdict by Virender Sharma. Replays revealed the delivery from R. Ashwin would have missed the leg-stump by some distance. Although one could sympathise with Young for the delay in decision-making, the episode stretched the sequence of poor judgements seen from the on-field umpires, Nitin Menon and Virender Sharma, in this match. Significantly, nothing could take away from India’s resolve that led to an amazing resurrection. In the process, Shreyas Iyer became the first Indian debutant to follow up a century with a half-century. No less important was the role of R. Ashwin who walked in at 51 for five and straightaway met fire with fire. After Ashwin’s exit, Wriddhiman Saha made light of his sprained neck to stand tall. Once Shreyas fell at the stroke of tea, Axar Patel came good with the bat. In fact, the Shreyas-Ashwin pair provided more than mere first aid to a bleeding India. Ashwin batted with the confidence of a man determined to take the battle to the enemy camp. He did not let a single loose ball go unpunished and sent the ball past the boundary five times. In this association of 52 runs, Ashwin’s 32 stood out! Healthy cover Thereafter, the 64-run Shreyas-Saha partnership was not only instrumental in providing the team a healthy cover but also in dampening New Zealand’s spirits. Thereafter, the unbroken 67-run association between Saha and Axar forced the Kiwis into a defensive mode and, with it, brightened India’s prospects of coming out triumphant. Much before this gallant fightback, New Zealand had its moments under the winter sun. After Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane failed again, the duo of Mayank Agarwal and Ravindra Jadeja departed in a Tim Southee over to make it four dismissals in the space of 19 runs spread over 8.3 overs. What followed was a tale of India’s resolute fightback.

29 November 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Argentina edges out Pakistan||Argentina thwarted Pakistan’s strong challenge to post a thrilling 4-3 win in its last Pool D match and enter the quarterfinals of the men’s hockey Junior World Cup at the Kalinga Stadium here on Sunday. Bukkens on song Argentina gathered six points from two wins to finish second in its pool and would meet Pool C topper the Netherlands, which rode on Miles Bukkens’ five goals to thrash USA 14-0, in the quarterfinals. Germany, which finished atop Pool D after beating Egypt 11-0, would take on second-placed Pool C side Spain. India will face Belgium, while France will lock horns with Malaysia in the other two quarterfinals. All the last-eight engagements will be held on Wednesday. Argentina went 1-0 up in the first quarter through Bautista Capurro’s 10th minute field goal. Pakistan fought back twice in an action-packed second quarter. Abdul Rana’s penalty-corner conversion made it 1-1 before Ignacio Nadrolillo restored the South American side’s lead in the 20th minute. Ali Rizwan’s penalty stroke conversion made it 2-2 but Francisco Ruiz again put Argentina ahead at the stroke of half-time. Following a barren third quarter, Ignacio Ibarra widened the lead. Aqeel Ahmed’s 53rd-minute penalty-corner conversion gave Pakistan hope and Argentina some nervous moments, but the latter managed to hold on to its slender lead.  The results:   Pool C: Netherlands bt USA 14-0; Spain bt Korea 9-0.   Pool D: Argentina bt Pakistan 4-3; Germany bt Egypt 11-0 .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/argentina-edges-out-pakistan/article37744679.ece
29 November 2021||KANPUR,||‘Happy where we are now’||For a second time this week, Shreyas Iyer played the saviour. After scoring 105 in the first innings to keep India in the hunt for a challenging first innings score, Shreyas was up to the task of lifting India from the depths of 51 for five with two retrieving stands with R. Ashwin and Wriddhiman Saha. In the process, the Mumbai batter scored 65, a knock that kept India ahead of New Zealand. Dravid’s instruction “I had been in this situation before, with my Ranji (Mumbai) team. The mindset was to play session by session. Rahul (Dravid) sir told me to bat as many balls as possible and I was determined to do that,” Shreyas said, reflected on the the day’s play. Was he aware that he became the first Indian batter to score a century and a half-century on debut? “Yeah, I knew about it. When I came back, one of my teammates told me about it. Many others have done it from other teams but I was told, I’m the first from India. It feels good but the most important thing is to win the match.” Asked about what the team thought was a good total to defend on this pitch, Shreyas said, “We felt that 250, including the first-innings lead (of 49 runs) would have been a good score. We’re very happy with where we are now. “Actually, not a lot was happening with the wicket today, the ball was keeping a bit low. “We have real spin power, so hopefully we can get the job done tomorrow.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/happy-where-we-are-now/article37744683.ece

29 November 2021||November 29 2021 00:00 IST,||CFC hopeful of an improved performance||Chennaiyin FC will fancy its chances against a NorthEast United FC searching for its first win when the two sides meet at Fatorda on Monday. Despite the 1-0 win over Hyderabad FC in the opening fixture thanks to a penalty in the second half, CFC produced a scrappy performance and coach Bozidar Bandovic identified areas of improvement from his team. “It is very important for mentality and confidence if you start with three points. We know that we need to be better at attacking and need to win many duels. We need to be stronger there,” said Bandovic on Sunday ahead of the game. However, the two-time ISL champion suffered a big blow after its star player Rafael Crivellaro, who missed the opener was ruled out for at least four weeks with a muscle injury. In Crivellaro’s absence, Vladimir Koman, who scored the winner from the spot in the first match is expected to fill his shoes and provide the creative spark in the midfield. “I hope this first win gave confidence to the players. It’s always nice scoring in the first game but especially if you score and your team win [then] it’s like double satisfaction,” said Koman. NorthEast started with a 4-2 defeat to Bengaluru FC before playing out a goalless draw against Kerala Blasters FC. Assistant coach Alison Kharsyntiew saw the positive from the last game with the first point on board and hoped to build on it. “We did not concede a goal, which is a positive thing. We look forward to this game and we need to put more effort into the attack and create more chances,” said Kharsyntiew.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/cfc-hopeful-of-an-improved-performance/article37744777.ece
29 November 2021||Melbourne,||Pat Cummins has nothing to hide||Australia’s newly-appointed Test captain Pat Cummins has revealed he was asked to share any secrets he might have had before he was handed the leadership role by the selection panel. Cummins was made Australia’s 47th Test captain ahead of the Ashes series after Tim Paine stepped down last week and took an indefinite break from cricket following the ‘sexting scandal’. While Cummins was choosen for the top job, former skipper Steve Smith was handed the vice-captaincy, three years after he was suspended for a year for his role in the ball-tampering scandal that rocked Australian cricket in 2018. Asked if the Cricket Australia panel had asked him “anything like a confession” before being appointed captain, Cummins replied in the affirmative. “Yeah, there were a couple of questions. I won’t go into detail,” Cummins told ABC Sport. “It was a really good open discussion. We talked about a lot of different things. So we both left it feeling really comfortable,” he said The five-person panel comprised selectors George Bailey and Tony Dodemaide, former Australia batter and current CA board member Mel Jones, CEO Nick Hockley and chair Richard Freudenstein.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/pat-cummins-has-nothing-to-hide/article37744917.ece

The unseeded Ajay had warmed up for the last eight by defeating fifth-seeded Mikhael S. Varghese 21-9, 21-14 in the pre-quarterfinals.

Anaswara took a five-point lead early in the second set and maintained it to win 21-15. After trailing 8-11 in the third, Anaswara equalised the scores and forged ahead as a tired Nayana slipped into errors.  The results:   Men: Quarterfinals: Ajay Satish Kumar Nair (Tvm) bt N.P.

29 November 2021||November 29 2021 00:00 IST,||No breakthrough yet at the Worlds||A day after a cracker of a contest, challenger Ian Nepomniachtchi and champion Magnus Carlsen were involved in a quick 41-move draw, in under three hours, in the third round of their World chess championship clash in Dubai on Sunday. Going into Monday’s rest day, the players were locked 1.5-1.5 after three rounds. The first player to reach 7.5 points in this 14-game contest will win the title. The third game, that followed the opening lines of Ruy Lopez seen in the first game on Friday, was evenly fought. A series of exchanges followed and the battle reached an endgame where the players had a bishop and five pawns each. The equal game was drawn after a three-fold repetition of moves.  Interestingly, soon after the game, Carlsen chose to describe his 10th move from the black side as a “really dumb move, but it turns out even here he (Nepo) was well prepared and didn’t give me even any slight chances to play.” Nepo, on his part, described Sunday’s clash as a “clean and logical game.” After three draws, the players return to the board on Tuesday, Carlsen’s birthday, with the champion playing with white pieces.

29 November 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Egypt has to invest more in the future, says coach Maggid||Egypt has made nine appearances in the men’s hockey Junior World Cup — with a best of ninth at Milton Keynes in 1997 — but has never played in a senior World Cup. Abu Talib Maggid, the Egypt head coach at the ongoing JWC at the Kalinga Stadium here, shared his ideas on why the African nation always struggled to make an impact in the sport.  “We miss the process. It cannot happen overnight. You have to invest and wait for the result. We have played in two Olympics (1992, 2004) but no senior World Cups,” Maggid said during an interaction with The Hindu . “Africa has one place in the senior World Cup and two places in the junior. This could be one of the reasons (for several JWC appearances). “We have to be the strongest in Africa to get into the senior World Cup,” he said. Egypt had the ignominy of suffering one of the biggest defeats at the current JWC when it lost its Pool D match to Argentina 14-0. However, Maggid took lessons from the crushing defeat and guided his team to a better performance, a 3-1 loss, against Pakistan. “This is the first-ever foreign exposure for them. This is a promising team. We get six matches here, they will learn with each match,” said Maggid .  Lack of practice “Owing to the unusual pandemic situation, we could barely manage 14 practice sessions. “In two-three years this will prove to be a very good build-up for (producing) more senior players for the national team,” he said. The hockey fraternity needs to strive to raise the popularity of the game in his country, Maggid added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/egypt-has-to-invest-more-in-the-future-says-coach-abu-talib-maggid/article37744726.ece

Abhinaav (Chennai) 21-8, 21-7 to emerge the champion.  “Right through the championship, my plan was to dominate and I did just that. I have been waiting for this breakthrough and when it came my way, I executed my plans accordingly,” he said after the title win. “I have always prepared hard for any tournament but failed to succeed the past three years. This time around, it worked in my favour. It’s just the start for me and, I hope to achieve bigger things for my State,” he added. Methini brought cheer for the host defeating top seed V.S. Jayani (Tiruvallur) 21-18, 21-9. The former was able to coast through as she had played the latter several times before. “I was able to read her game quickly and converted it into a win, which is very important as I had put in lots of hard work,” she said.

29 November 2021||November 29 2021 00:00 IST,||BFC, Blasters in dull draw||Kerala Blasters and Bengaluru FC played out a largely dull and dispiriting 1-1 draw at the Bambolim Stadium on Sunday. It was only fitting that the goals scored during the course of the morose evening were both scraps. In the 84th minute, Ashique Kuruniyan’s right-footed drive from distance appeared to be going out, only for Blasters goalie Albino Gomes to pull the ball back into his own net. Four minutes later, Kuruniyan was on the scoresheet again, but this time after an own goal as he blasted the ball into the roof of the net while trying to clear. But even those 10 minutes of drama cannot mask what transpired before that as the first half was largely forgettable. A clash of heads resulting in some blood on the field, Kuruniyan and Vincy Barretto indulging in a bit of cat and mouse and Harmanjot Khabra denying Sunil Chhetri twice were the only notable moments. The level lifted slightly in the second period, with both teams trying to attack the opposition box. After a few harmless long-range punts from far, BFC forward Cleiton Silva, near the hour mark, swung in a fine ball from the left flank to find Udanta Singh in space, only for the latter to fluff his attempt. Pezzaiuoli rang in the changes, taking out Chhetri and midfielder Iman Basafa. So did Blasters’ Ivan Vukomanovic, withdrawing Barretto and Sahal Abdul Samad. Prince Ibara, who replaced Chhetri, made a few darting runs down the right flank but nothing came off them. In the 83rd minute, though, Silva missed a golden chance, drilling a volley from five yards out straight at Gomes. The action thereafter livened up proceedings, but it was a match the club faithful will be happy to think no more of.  The result: Bengaluru FC 1 (Kuruniyan 84) drew with Kerala Blasters 1 (Kuruniyan 88-og).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bfc-blasters-in-dull-draw/article37744542.ece

The 27-year-old Ramkumar, who had lost six Challenger finals, beat his Russian rival 6-1, 6-4 in 68 minutes. Good serves The Indian, who served extremely well and was sharp with his net game, earned 80 ATP points and went home richer by $7,200. Ramkumar, seeded sixth and ranked 222 in the world, sealed the first set when the Russian’s backhand return sailed over the baseline. This was after Ramkumar had saved a breakpoint against Karlovskiy, ranked 302 in the world.  The ranking points earned will push Ramkumar back into the top-200 and also make him the highest-ranked Indian on the ATP singles ranking chart. He is likely to be ranked 186 and will surpass Prajnesh Gunneswaran (215) and out-of-action Sumit Nagal (219) when the chart is updated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ramkumar-wins-maiden-challenger/article37744721.ece

29 November 2021||November 29 2021 00:00 IST,||The Lord's residence||Azhwar's hymns are known as 'Arulicheyal,' meaning hymns directly inspired by God's grace. All of them acknowledge that they are the medium through which God sings His own glories. His Supremacy is limitless and beyond human grasp. He is all-pervading and His omniscience and omnipotence are incomparable. All these are captured as personal experiences in their hymns. They can see His presence as the inner soul and total ruler of the entire creation. This jagat, His manifestation comprising the sentient and non-sentient, forms His body. They show that God has chosen to live in the archa form in the Divya Desams so that he can grace His devotees and help them get out of samsara, pointed out Sri A. K. Sundarrajan in a discourse. We can easily offer worship to the deity in temples and thereby cultivate bhakti towards Him by His grace. More special to the devotee is His Antaryami form, His choice to dwell in the hearts of His sincere devotees. This strengthens the bond between the Lord and the bhakta. Pey Azhwar asserts that the same God who resides in the Vedas also chooses to dwell in the hearts of those jnanis who are self controlled and are steeped in God alone. He entreats us to pray to God to enter our hearts for only with His help we can gain control over the senses that are our real enemy. In a hymn, Azhwar conveys the qualities of exceptional God love through the eyes of a mother who is unable to console her daughter who is deeply in love with the Lord at Parkadal. The daughter says she would visit only Tiruvengadam, and bathe only in the divine waters of Parkadal. She refuses flowers and prefers only Tulsi leaves for adorning her tresses. It is clear that the Lord is present in her entire self, her thought, word and deed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/the-lords-residence/article37744512.ece

29 November 2021||November 29 2021 00:00 IST,||A little luck, seven tiles and a whole lot of words||In a game of Scrabble, you do the best you can with the tiles you draw. At the ongoing international Scrabble tournament, which commenced on November 20, eight contestants from India are pitting their vocabulary against 120 players from more than 40 countries. Known as the World English-Language Scrabble Players Association Championship (WESPAC), it is the first time the tournament has gone online, due to COVID-19-imposed travel restrictions in many countries. “As this board game is popular in most English-speaking nations, each country, based on its historical performance, is given a quota for the number of people they can nominate. This quota increases over time and India has moved up from the initial one seat to four. This year, the Indian contingent has been allotted four wildcard spots as well,” says Sudhir Kamath, president, Scrabble Association of India (SAI). The championship is a biennial event that began in 1991 and India’s first entrant, Mohan Chunkath, who participated in 1999, is an entrant in this edition as well. “This is the first time I will be playing a serious tournament online, even though I have been engaging with other gamers in the online format way before the pandemic — there is a dearth of serious Scrabble enthusiasts or a club in most cities,” rues Chennai-based Mohan, 65, a retired IAS officer. However, Mohan, who is a five-time holder of the National Champion title, says many youngsters have taken to the game in recent times. Two of the four wildcards allotted to India were granted to preteens — Madhav Gopal Kamath (11) from Delhi and Suyash Manchali (12) from Bengaluru — who are among the youngest players to have participated in a WESPAC event. Both boys developed a passion for the game watching the adults in their family. The lack of a Scrabble club or group in either of their schools, has not dulled their enthusiasm. Though there is a youth tournament for those under 18 and a senior citizens’ one for those above 55, at the world championships there is no age classification — all entrants will face off with each other at least once. “This is the first time I will be playing a main event online against other adults and I am a bit nervous,” says Madhav Gopal Kamath, a Class VI student at Sanskriti School in Delhi. Madhav, who came second at the U-18 championship this August, has been competing online and with his father to prepare for the event. Suyash Manchali is nervous too, though he has participated in the World Youth Cup twice. Now a Class VII student of MES Kishore Kendra School in Bengaluru, Suyash says, “I was seven years old and I saw my mother was fascinated with these small squares with both letters and numbers that you could count. She is the one who taught me to play.” The Indian team at WESPAC 2021 will be led by reigning national champion Sherwin Rodrigues from Mumbai, and includes Udayan Grover from Pune, Mohan Chunkath from Chennai, and Nakul Prabhu from Mumbai as well as wildcard holders Sanjoy Gupta and Suyash Manchali from Bengaluru, Kala Ganesh from Mumbai and Madhav Gopal Kamath from Delhi. “All participants will play 32 games each, squaring off with a different opponent every time. A system of totalling scored points and winning margins determines the ranking of each player. The top 20 move on to the finals — a knockout stage featuring the top eight players,” says Sudhir. The tournament will conclude on December 5 and is being held online every weekend.

29 November 2021||November 29 2021 00:00 IST,||When walls have eyes, ears, and voices||“That’s the keerai lady,” laughs Shakeela Begum, pausing in front of Block 10 of the Tamil Nadu Urban Habitat Development Board at Ukkadam in Coimbatore. She is on her way to the grocery store and has stopped to chat with the artists. The building is the canvas for Trespassers, a Kerala-based artists’ collective. They have been invited to work at Ukkadam ‘art district’, a public art initiative by St+art India Foundation, in association with Asian Paints and Coimbatore City Municipal Corporation. Shakeela looks at the building with growing familiarity. Painted on it are her friends and neighbours: the wingless parrot seated on a blue plastic drum; the lady in a yellow dupatta buying vegetables from a grocery shop; a brown and white tabby cat that lounges on a sunshade; a goat that gingerly makes its way up a staircase. Artists Jinil Manikandan, Arjun Gopi, Pranav Prabhakaran, and Sijoy Paulose from Trespassers, have specifically picked people, animals, and objects that form the imagery of the locality as their subjects. The artists are wrapping up their work as you read this, and have been painting on Block 10 from the beginning of this month. “We spent the first four days once we arrived, simply walking around and getting to know the place and the people,” says 26-year-old Jinil. This was where it all began: conversations with the residents, glimpses into their houses, games with little boys and puppies that followed them around… they are all there on the wall in some form. Jinil says that they were particularly taken in by what people said about the pandemic lockdowns. “They said it was a jolly time,” he smiles, adding, “these are small one-bedroom houses and it is impossible to maintain physical distancing. The entire building was in a quarantine bubble. They were together the whole time when the lockdowns were imposed.” Their work is, in fact, a scene from one such day. “This was when everyday objects that were lying around the house took up new significance; people started noticing the surroundings they took for granted all along,” points out Jinil. Just then, his fellow-artist Pranav, hops off the scaffolding on which he was painting from. A streak of white paint on his cheek, Pranav talks about the wingless parrot that is featured. “It just sits on the drum all day,” he says, pointing to the painting. The team worked without a plan. “We incorporated new characters as and when we saw them,” explains Pranav. The artists worked with over 50 children in the locality to paint a wall at a park nearby as part of the community engagement activities of the project. Which explains why they are always surrounded by a gaggle of little boys, who comment on every new character that takes shape. This is what Trespassers want: their philosophy is to engage with regular people through their art. “We want to take art out of the confines of the gallery space that only an elite few have access to,” says Jinil. The 12-member collective was formed two years ago, and are from various parts of Kerala. They are all alumni of Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady in Ernakulam and have done several public art projects. “People who frequent a particular street will have subconsciously registered each object it is made of,” says Jinil. “If say, one of our artworks comes up on a building there, it will eventually become an everyday object they encounter — we will have hence ‘trespassed’ on their visual memory even without them realising it,” he adds, interpreting their collective’s name. Does it irk that their art will eventually fade with time, dust, and sun? “Not one bit,” says Jinil. “This is part of the process. We stop becoming artists the moment our work is done,” he explains. “We are then merely spectators. We look at it with no idea of how it will eventually end up.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/when-walls-have-eyes-ears-and-voices/article37745104.ece
04 December 2021||November 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Combat learning loss||The pandemic-induced learning loss is estimated to be at 220 million globally, with the figure in India being around 35 million. A survey by an ed-tech organisation revealed that, compared to pre-pandemic times, only 40-60% of learning was retained over the past 18 months. In India, the problem of learning loss has been exacerbated due to factors such as weak online teaching, insufficient content and digital divide. Occurrence Rajdeep of Bhawanipur Education Society College, West Bengal and Devadarshika and Gurumoorthy of Hindustan Deemed-to-be-University mentioned that many students struggled with lack of attention and interest in what was being taught. Kaustav from West Bengal’s Burdwan University agreed: “Students find learning to be tedious and find it difficult to focus on studies.” Ritesh Dandapat, from Symbiosis Law School Noida, pointed out that students being able to do other things while attending online classes led to a lack of focus and disciple. Souparno Bhattacharya, who studies in Chennai, sums this up: “A change of dynamics in the course of learning will lead to a situation where the primary and fundamental knowledge previously possessed by students will be forgotten.” Causes and consequences According to Manjur, Presidency College, Kolkata, ineffective teaching in physical and online classes has been a causative agent. Many other students across the country have identified a lack of physical interaction with friends and teachers, increased screen time, poor network connectivity, more concentration on tech over studies, eye and muscle fatigue due to constant screen time, closed spaces and regular disciplining by parents, and a lethargic attitude as factors which further intensified learning disability.  While Justin Joseph from Hindustan Deemed-to -be-University sees lack of professionalism, increase in unethical activities and no idea about one’s future as consequences, Rajdeep points to a herd mentality in learning outcomes. Others like Ritesh fear the prospects of lower productivity, unemployment, low self-esteem among other issues. A slowdown in learning, inability to connect the dots, and lag in conceptual understanding across subjects will create a lasting problem, says Mohammed Manjur from Kolkata. What can be done First, the learning process can be made more attractive by including practical and recreational activities into the academic content, is a suggestion from Mohammed Manjur. More audio and video content would help increase the retention rate. Bridge and remedial courses and community-based engagement can be used to enhance the learning process. Kaustuv feels that increased use of television and radio to broadcast lessons in areas with poor internet connectivity would help bridge the digital divide. Implementing new learning techniques, enabling students to be active participants in the process, better student-teacher ratio and consistent institutional support are some of the other measures that could be looked at. Role of society and government The role of the family in providing emotional and mental support was raised by Janet, a student from Chennai. Parents must stop imposing their dreams on the children, she emphasises, adding that teachers must also help solve students’ problems and the peer group should be cooperative and supportive. One way of bridging the digital divide would be for the government to provide devices and uninterrupted power and Internet connectivity.

29 November 2021||November 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Have a pawsome new year||Surya looks majestic, lying down with his paws touching each other, his white-furred neck erect, and his striking green eyes focussed, as if he is looking ahead to something. It is an apt cover image for EveryLife 2022, Humane Animal Society’s (HAS) annual charity calendar. Surya came to HAS as a wounded, tiny kitten. One of his legs had to be amputated. “We put him up for adoption. But nobody adopted him. So, he ended up being one of our resident cats,” says Mini Vasudevan, HAS co-founder. Despite the loss of a limb, Surya is a sprightly cat, who is also very comfortable around dogs. Surya is one of 20 rescued animals featured in the HAS calendar. “Every month has a special story. It is as if the animal says what it is feeling. We have tried to personify them,” adds Mini. June, for instance, features Cookie, a brown, three-limbed mongrel. “She had met with an accident and one of her limbs was necrosed. We didn’t think she would survive the night,” recalls Mini, “but a day after the surgery to remove the injured limb, she started improving. She probably doesn’t know she has lost a leg. Because she’s completely poised and looks majestic. She inspires us because she has survived a really bad situation.” Cookie’s caption reads, “I am an impossibility made possible. I am disbelief turned true. I am all that you can make me be.” The lines are by Shobhana Kumar, a poet and founder of the NGO Small Differences. Last year was not great for stray cats and dogs in Coimbatore, says Mini. “Abandonment, accidents, and diseases increased. Adoption had gone up as well. But with people returning to their offices, we need to see if some of the adopted animals will be abandoned again. We used to get more volunteers. But now everyone has become busy again.” There are about 200 rescued animals with HAS. About 15 to 25 animals get adopted each month, says Mini. “There are people who adopt a differently-abled dog or cat. So, we have a lot of people who have come forward to care for these animals.” Mini wishes to see more such people next year.
