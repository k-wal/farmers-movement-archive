---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Police ask organisers to call off comedian Munawar Faruqui's show||BENGALURU: On the backdrop of criminal cases registered against stand-up comedian Munawar Faruqui in other states, city cops have written to organisers of the comedy show, asking them to call off the show to be staged here on Sunday evening. The letter has been written to Vishesh Dhuria of Curtain Call events, Delhi, by Ashoknagar Police, under whose jurisdiction the show ‘Dongri to Nowhere’ was set to be held at Good Shepherd auditorium on Sunday. “It is learned that Munawar Faruqui is a controversial figure for his controversial statements on other religion and gods. Many states have banned his comedy shows. It is learned that a case has been registered against him in the Tukoganj police station, Indore of Madhya Pradesh (Mainly under IPC 295A- Deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs). Similar cases have been registered against him in many states. There is credible information that several organisations are opposing this stand-up comedy show performed by Faruqui. This could create chaos and could disturb the public peace and harmony which may further lead to law and order problems. Therefore, it is suggested that you should cancel Faruqui’s comedy show,” read the letter by Ashoknagar police station inspector, written on Saturday. A senior officer confirmed that they have not given permission for the show and shall initiate legal action if the organisers continue to host the show.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-police-ask-organisers-to-call-off-comedian-munawar-faruquis-show/articleshow/87954553.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

Kovind said reforms in the judge selection process is a “pertinent issue”, which should be attempted without diluting the independence of judiciary. "I am of the firm view that independence of judiciary is non-negotiable. Without diluting it to the slightest degree, can a better way be found to select judges for the higher judiciary," the President asked during his speech at the valedictory function of the ‘Constitution Day’ celebrations at Vigyan Bhavan. Listening to him were Chief Justice of India N V Ramana, SC judges and Chief Justices of the high courts. The President said, "There can be an all-India Judicial Service which can select, nurture and promote the right talent from the lowest to the higher levels. This idea is not new and has been around for more than half a century without being tested." "I am sure there could also be better suggestions to reform the (judge selection) system. Ultimately, the aim should be to strengthen the justice delivery mechanism," Kovind said. On October 15, 2016, a five-judge bench had by 4:1 majority struck down the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) and revived the SC-scripted quarter century-old collegium system. It had set the stage for a confrontation with the executive, which played truant for some time in accepting collegium recommendations for appointment of judges. The main ground for striking down NJAC was the presence of the law minister and two eminent jurists in the six-member body. The SC had feared that the minister and jurists could join hands to reject the proposals of the judiciary – the Chief Justice of India and two senior-most judges of SC. Under the quashed NJAC, any two members could veto a proposal. On Friday, SC Bar Association (SCBA) President Vikas Singh too said the collegium system for selection of judges needs to be streamlined, preferably through legislative process. He said the SC judgment mandates a Memorandum of Procedure to ensure that best names are considered by the collegium transparently. "A suitable legislation in the form of a bill to regulate the collegium system can be brought within the said limitation to facilitate appointment of judges to the HCs and SC," he said. President Kovind also flagged the monstrous pendency, probably taking a cue from Attorney General K K Venugopal's flagging of cases taking 30 years to reach finality and complaining that this is not giving justice but violating the litigant's fundamental right to speedy justice. Kovind said long pendency of cases pose enormous challenges to all stakeholders in the judiciary. Though many debates and suggestions have come in the past to tackle pendency, "the debate continues and pendency keeps increasing. Ultimately, the citizens and organisations, which have grievances, bear the brunt", he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/judges-appointing-judges-system-needs-reform-president-kovind/articleshow/87954551.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||President Kovind: Exercise discretion in court utterances||NEW DELHI: Hailing the judiciary for maintaining the highest standards of conduct and for being the most trusted institution in which people have reposed faith, President Ram Nath Kovind, however, said judges should exercise utmost discretion while passing observations in court proceedings as it could lead to dubious interpretation. Speaking at the valedictory function of the Constitution Day in the presence of the CJI, judges of Supreme Court and high courts, and the law minister, Kovind also emphasised the need to bring reform in the judiciary to make justice more speedy and accessible and also to improve gender balance in the institution. “In Indian tradition, judges are imagined as a model of rectitude and detachment more akin to ‘sthitpragya’. We have a rich history of legions of such judges known for their utterances full of sagacity and conduct beyond reproach, which have become hallmarks for future generations. I’m happy to note that the Indian judiciary has been adhering to those highest standards,” he said. “There is no doubt that you have set for yourself a high bar. Hence, it is also incumbent upon judges to exercise utmost discretion in their utterances in the courtrooms. Indiscreet remarks, even if made with good intention, give space for dubious interpretations to run down the judiciary,” Kovind added. He also expressed concern over the judiciary being targeted on social media by some miscreants and hoped that it remained an aberration and short-lived phenomenon. “Right from the beginning, the judiciary consistently conformed to those highest standards of conduct while discharging its responsibility. In people’s view, it is the most trusted institution. It pains me no end, therefore, to note that of late there have been cases of some disparaging remarks against the judiciary made on social media platforms. These platforms have worked wonderfully to democratise information, yet they have a dark side too. The anonymity granted by them is exploited by some miscreants,” the President said. CJI NV Ramana said the judiciary should not be solely blamed for delay in decision and acquittals in criminal cases. “Another set of misunderstandings relate to the belief that the courts are responsible for liberal acquittals and adjournments. However, the truth is that the public prosecutors, advocates and parties — all have to cooperate with judicial process. Non-cooperation, procedural lapses and faulty probe cannot be blamed on courts,” he said. Law minister Kiren Rijiju said his government was committed to improve judicial infrastructure and Rs 9,000 crore has been sanctioned for this purpose. “As informed by the law minister, the government has been allocating substantial amounts for development of judicial infrastructure. However, funds aren’t the problem. The problem is with some of the states not coming forward to match the grants. As a result, the central funds largely remain unutilised. That’s the reason why I am proposing a special purpose vehicle of Judicial Infrastructure of Authority. I beseech the minister to take this proposal to logical conclusion. I also urge him to expedite the process of filling judicial vacancies,” the CJI said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/president-kovind-exercise-discretion-in-court-utterances/articleshow/87954639.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

If there is one thing the Constitution does not contemplate it is the comfort of conformity or the tranquility of the familiar,” said the HC judge as chief speaker at The Leaflet’s Constitution Day talk titled ‘Undermining the idea of India: The Way Forward’. Justice Gautam Patel“The counter points and counter narratives are now, thanks to technology, almost impossible to silence. There may be more adverse comments and more noisiness now than ever before. But is that not the point. Is it not what our Constitution contemplates or even demands, when it says the idea of India is embedded in the concept of union of states and of its constitutionally mandated choice to give any government its marching orders at defined intervals.”The judge said, “There is only one idea of India. The Constitutional idea. It is in an Article of the Constitution that is seldom discussed or addressed. Article 1. The Article 1 states that India, that is Bharat, shall be a union of States.” “This has to be the idea of India, for without it India cannot exist,” he stressed adding, “Everything in the Constitution flows from this concept.” He said the seeds planted in the Constitution have taken hold but added, “We should not I think be too sanguine, as we have seen there will be continued attempts by every government everywhere to maintain control, to transition from government to ruler. That is something we must guard against.” Justice Patel said it is time to stop using terms like ‘ruling party’ and ‘rulers’ as people are ‘governed’, not ruled. It is time to get rid of “colonial linguistic baggage”, he said, adding, “India has no rulers and so long as the Constitution exists it never will be. It may be governed for a limited period of time, but never ruled,” he said. He also said there are two “beacons,” one of which is the judiciary, the “last bastion or the final frontier”. “The judiciary frightens the government seeking to cling to power like nothing else does. Our own history shows repeated attempts to weaken the judiciary, most especially during the Emergency, and we are again, by no means, alone. From Turkey to eastern Europe to South America and the United States, this is a tale with regional variations,” said the judge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-such-thing-as-too-much-dissent-bombay-high-court-judge/articleshow/87954704.cms||Swati Deshpande

The accused was arrested with the help of local residents later. According to reports, Pradeep Debroy of Sheoratali locality in Ramchandraghat went berserk on Friday night and brutally killed his two minor daughters, Mandira (7) and Aditi (01), with the crowbar. He also attacked his wife Mina Pal (32), leaving her critically injured. When his elder brother, Amalesh, tried to stop him, he hit him on the head with the crowbar, killing him on the spot. Debroy then went out of the house and attacked an auto rickshaw passenger Krishna Das (45), who died on the spot. The auto driver and the deceased’s son, Karanbir, escaped with minor injuries. Alerted by villagers, a large contingent of police led by second officer of Khowai police station Satyajit Mallik rushed to the spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cop-among-5-slain-by-tripura-crowbar-killer/articleshow/87954774.cms||Biswendu Bhattacharjee

---||Meerut||UP: Amit Shah to lay foundation of new varsity in Saharanpur on December 2||LUCKNOW: Union home minister and former BJP chief Amit Shah will be in Saharanpur, a district dominated by Muslims and Dalits, on December 2, for the first time after prime minister Narendra Modi announced repeal of three contentious farm laws. Though the farmers are continuing their protest with various other demands including MSP guarantee, Shah’s visit is being seen by many as BJP’s bid to woo farmers in UP, who are mostly from Jat community from West UP region, and Dalits. During his visit, Shah will lay the foundation stone for Maa Shakumbhari Devi University in Behat assembly constituency. A senior BJP leader told TOI that though the date is almost confirmed, the final decision would be taken on Sunday. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who had announced the naming of the university after Ma Shakumbari Devi, would also be present with Amit Shah, the senior BJP leader confirmed. Of the seven assembly seats falling in Saharanpur district, four are with BJP, two with Congress and one with the Samajwadi Party. However, of the total 80 seats in west UP region, 60 are with the BJP. The saffron party faces the challenge to at least maintain the status quo. Nakur and Gangoh seats fall under Kairana Lok Sabha constituency while the remaining five fall in Saharanpur Lok Sabha constituency. BJP’s Raghav Lakhan Pal was defeated by BSP’s Fazlur Rehman in 2019 Lok Sabha election from Saharanpur constituency while BJP’s Pradeep Chaudhary won from Kairana Lok Sabha seat. However, since 2017, when the BJP performed exceptionally well in the West UP region in particular, the challenges and stakes before the BJP have increased. Some major challenges include winning back the Saharanpur City seat from SP. The seat was won by Rajeev Gumber of BJP in 2012 but SP’s Sanjay Garg managed to win the seat in 2017. The district is the stronghold of Congress leader Imran Masood. The BJP has a challenge to make a dent in Masood’s clout in the district along with wooing Dalit vote bank from BSP. Azad Samaj Party’s Chandrashekhar also has a stronghold in the district as it belongs to Saharanpur. His strength would be tested in the coming assembly elections as he failed to leave any impact in the previous Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections. Naresh Saini of Congress had won from Behat vidhan sabha constituency in 2017 assembly polls. The district has around 40% dominance of the minority community while Dalits, mainly Jatavs, who have remained loyal to Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party are second in terms of population. Shah’s visit to Saharanpur is being seen as the party’s bid to mobilise the party cadre in the run up to Vidhan Sabha elections. Former MP from Saharanpur Raghav Lakhan Pal told TOI that the demand for setting up a university was long pending and would cater to the needs of the youths. “Shakumbari Devi temple is in Behat and the goddess is revered throughout the West UP region. Naming of the university in the goddess’s name has made the people of Saharanpur happy,” a senior BJP leader said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-amit-shah-to-lay-foundation-of-new-varsity-in-saharanpur-on-december-2/articleshow/87954793.cms||---

It may not necessarily be lethal or result in severe form of disease. There is no such data, as of now. Of course, we have to wait and see,” says Samiran Panda, Head of Epidemiology & Communicable Diseases, at ICMR. According to Panda, the structural changes or mutations found in SARS-COV2 through genome sequencing in the lab are indicative but do not necessarily mean the new variant is highly transmissible. However, active vigilance and preventive measures are important, he said. “There is no need to panic. We need to ramp up vaccination immediately. If larger proportion of people will be covered with two doses of vaccine, that will be a great public health move. Besides, there is need to strengthen genome sequencing among international travellers,” Panda said. Underlining that even if the mutation is serious, the mode of transmission remains same and therefore, vaccination and other public health measures such as proper use of mask, avoiding mass gatherings and hand sanitisation are crucial to combat the situation. The WHO’s Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution on Friday assessed the new variant B.1.1.529, which was first reported to the UN health agency from South Africa on November 24. “This variant has a large number of mutations, some of which are concerning. Preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant, as compared to other VOCs. The number of cases of this variant appears to be increasing in almost all provinces in South Africa,” WHO said while designating Omicron as ‘VOC’. Apart from South Africa, Hong Kong, Botswana, Israel and Belgium have reported Covid-19 cases due to Omicron. Panda said the alarm has been raised because cases have been found in multiple countries though not all countries have reported many cases. “International travellers need to be under surveillance because the cases have entered other countries due to movement of people globally. In many countries the number of cases due to this mutation are few. Then, how can I say it is more transmissible. We are deliberating on it and time will only tell,” he said. While India has not yet reported any case of Covid-19 due to the new mutant variant, this might be an opportunity to ramp up vaccination coverage and implement stringent public health measures to avoid any surge in cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-need-to-panic-over-new-covid-19-variant-icmr/articleshow/87954947.cms||Sushmi Dey

The country’s apex vaccine testing facility — Central Drug Laboratory (CDL) in Kasauli, Himachal Pradesh — has tested over 1,114 batches of Covid jabs between January till October, containing over 1.5 billion doses of Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V. The batches also included some of Biological E’s Jannsen and Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D. All batches of vaccines, including those that are imported, released for use or administration in the country or for export has to mandatorily undergo testing and quality control scrutiny at the CDL, Kasauli. “There have been zero rejection in Covid vaccine batches received so far. This is primarily because the manufacturing is of high quality and standard. The domestic companies manufacturing vaccines in India are in the vaccine business for many years now and understand the science very well,” a regulatory official said. In general, the average rejection rate in overall vaccines (non-Covid) stands at nearly 0.2%. One of the key responsibilities of CDL is to ensure quality of each and every lot of vaccines before it is released into the market for use.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-batch-of-vaccine-failed-safety-efficacy-test-so-far-govt/articleshow/87955124.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||World||WTO puts off key Geneva meet over variant concerns||NEW DELHI: Four days before kick-off, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) put off a ministerial meeting that was to decide on crucial global rules, citing heightened risk after the outbreak of the “particularly transmissible” African variant of the coronavirus. The decision, which came on Friday night, followed a fresh Covid wave in Europe with countries such as Switzerland hit particularly hard. Switzerland has one of the lowest vaccination rate in western Europe with an estimated 65% population having been jabbed. The WTO, however, steered clear of the situation in Europe and blamed the new variant found in parts of Africa for the indefinite postponement.  “The General Council agreed to postpone the imminent ministerial conference after an outbreak of a particularly transmissible strain of the Covid-19 virus led several governments to impose travel restrictions that would have prevented many ministers from reaching Geneva,” a statement from the global trade body said. WTO director general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said the travel constraints meant that many senior delegates could not have participated in face-to-face negotiations. This would render participation on an equal basis impossible, she said. Several Indian delegates were worried about travelling to Geneva due to the surge in infections.Ministers from over 160 countries were scheduled to meet from November 30 to Decemeber 3 to decide on several crucial issues, including a patent waiver for Covid vaccines, drugs and medical devices, which will help the poor, especially in Africa. The decision has, however, been blocked by a handful of European Union members led by Germany, along with the UK, Switzerland and Japan. The WTO DG and the General Council Chair Ambassador Dacio Castillo of Honduras called upon WTO members to maintain the negotiation momentum. So far, the members have made little headway on the talks, with several of India’s concerns yet to be addressed.This is the second time that Covid-19, which was first detected in China in late 2019, has forced a postponement of the 12th Ministerial meet. It was originally due to take place in June 2020 in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan. Although the General Council decided to move the meeting to Geneva, Kazakhstan was chosen to chair the meeting in Geneva.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/wto-puts-off-key-geneva-meet-over-variant-concerns/articleshow/87955160.cms||---

The government has also stressed on adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour and decided on penalties for drivers, conductors of public transport and office management in case any person is found violating norms such as wearing of masks. The defaulting individual will be fined too. Senior officials said the new restrictions have been added to push people towards getting themselves fully vaccinated.

Private organisations are extending their vaccination drive for third doses without providing a certificate. Meanwhile, the government is likely to come out with its policy on additional dose in the coming week for people with predefined conditions. However, their primary objective will be to immunise the 10-12 crores who remain unvaccinated. Retired medical teacher and an advisor to NGOs, Dr Suresh Sundar, said he had volunteered for the Covishield vaccine trial last year. “It’s been more than a year. I have been writing to agencies requesting them to clarify the status of booster doses for trial volunteers. Their focus, though, would be to achieve maximum coverage of first and second doses in the population,” he said. On Saturday, Dr Suresh, with help from his friends in the medical fraternity, took the third dose privately. “Hope the government takes a decision soon for healthcare personnel, who come in close contact with patients, or are immune compromised,” he said. A few doctors, even from government hospitals, have been taking their third doses eight to nine months after their first two shots . Dr Avinash Supe, former dean of KEM hospital, said many countries have started providing booster doses. “If vaccines are available at centres and healthcare workers are keen on taking their booster shots, the government should allow them to, but at their own expense,” said Supe. Another trial volunteer said, “We are not sure if there are any health implications. We also want clarity on whether we can mix different vaccine doses,” he said. Dr NK Arora, chief of Covid-19 working group of National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation in India (NTAGI) said that data on breakthrough infections is constantly being monitored. “There are two types of immune response visible and invisible. Just because there is a drop in antibodies, one need not rush for a booster dose. There is also cellular immunity, which is considered to be much more robust. Since a large number of the Indian population were naturally infected with the virus in the second wave, we have also developed what can be termed as hybrid immunity,” said Arora.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/with-no-policy-yet-citizens-opt-for-3rd-dose-privately/articleshow/87955485.cms||Yogita Rao

Modi chaired a comprehensive meeting to review the situation relating to Covid-19 and vaccination on Saturday, immediately after the World Health Organisation designated the new variant as “VOC” late on Friday. Highlighting the need to monitor international arrivals, the PM said travellers must be tested as per guidelines, with a specific focus on countries identified “at risk”. He also asked officials to increase coverage of the second dose of the vaccine and sensitise states on the need to ensure that all those who have got the first dose are given the second dose on time.

---||India||Farmers defer tractor rally to Parliament, say stir on||NEW DELHI/AMRITSAR: The protesting farmers’ unions on Saturday decided to suspend their tractor march to Parliament, scheduled from Monday, in the wake of the government’s move to list the repeal of farm laws in the Lok Sabha on the very first day of the winter session. They, however, asserted their protests would continue till they get a “written assurance” from the Centre on their six pending demands, including a legal guarantee on minimum support price (MSP). The unions will wait for the government’s response to the email they have sent to PM Modi on November 21 over their demands and take a call accordingly on their next course of action on December 4. Before the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) meeting, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said there was “no point in continuing farmers’ agitation” as the government had decided to repeal the laws and called on the unions to “show a big heart” and return to their home, keeping in mind the PM’s decision to repeal the laws. The government has already decriminalised stubble burning and will constitute a committee, with farmer representatives as its members, to look into the issue of making MSP transparent and effective, Tomar said. The unions, however, said the Centre must respond in writing or announce in Parliament a “legal guarantee” on MSP and hold talks on meeting their other pending demands. The decision to suspend the tractor march will save Delhi-NCR of traffic disruptions on Monday. Though the decision to reschedule was unexpected, the tractor march for the MSP and other demands might have seemed misplaced on the day Lok Sabha took up the repeal bills. The unions continue to block border points and the next course of action will be revealed once Parliament scraps the farm laws. “We have just suspended our tractor march to Parliament, taking in view the government’s move to repeal the law in Parliament. We are not convinced of what the government (Tomar) announced today. The government must give us written assurance or announce it in Parliament,” said Darshan Pal, leader of SKM. Asked about the rationale behind continuing the protests when Tomar has already announced decriminalising stubble burning and forming a committee on MSP, Pal said, “Merely forming a committee will not do. The government will have to say that the committee will work to make a law on legal guarantee on MSP. The announcement on stubble burning is not new. The government had already given this assurance.” Besides a legal guarantee on MSP, the other demands of the unions include withdrawal of the Electricity Amendment Bill, scrapping of provisions of fines (environmental compensation) for stubble burning in the Commission for Air Quality Management Law, withdrawal of cases against farmers registered by states and among others. Farmers are also demanding sacking and arrest of junior home minister Ajay Kumar Mishra over the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, and compensation to kin of around 700 farmers who died during the protests and allotment of a site at Singhu Border to set up a memorial for them. Though the government had in the law on constitution of Commission for Air Quality Management in Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas exempted farmers from hefty penalty (up to Rs 1 crore) and jail terms (up to five years) provisions for stubble burning, it introduced a new clause on ‘environmental compensation’ (Section 15) in the law – which attracted the ire of farmer unions. The Electricity (Amendment) Bill is, on the other hand, listed again for introduction during the winter session of the Parliament, beginning Monday. Farmer leaders, however, insisted that the Centre can direct BJP-ruled states such as Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, and Railways to drop those cases. "Around 48,000 cases were registered against the farmers in Haryana alone. Besides, there are many cases which are registered by other states and Indian Railways. The government must drop these cases," said Pal. The SKM leaders also called upon the government to "restart the dialogue process", and discuss the pending issues. “In a democracy, it is the duty of the elected government to consult the protesting farmers and resolve the disputes amicably," said the Morcha in a statement. Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait said in Amritsar that the farm groups would continue their scheduled agitation plan unless the Centre resolves issues like a guarantee on MSP, seed bill, pesticide bill, and other demands. The SKM leaders, including Tikait, denied they had any political agenda even after the changed circumstances. Asked about political statements issued by farmer leader Gurnam Singh Charuni, Tikait said he wanted to see SKM as strong and united and hoped it would remain so. “Ekka dukka bhag gaye to kya karay (If one or two quit, then what can we do?)” he questioned. Urging farmers and their supporters to continue to extend their support to the protests and send langar, Tikait said: “We want the farmers to bring jathas to Delhi borders at regular intervals.” Reacting to Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s statement that the ‘law on MSP was not possible,’ Tikait alleged that a ‘gang’ was hellbent on plundering the gullible farmers. “A machination is being hatched to plunder the farmers at the hands of corporate houses, we will get to know those who are involved in this gang,” he claimed. Questioning the ban on the export of fruits and vegetables to Pakistan from the international border in Punjab, Tikait said: “The rock salt is coming to India from Pakistan, but our farmers' tomatoes and other fruits and vegetables can’t cross the border,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/farmers-defer-tractor-rally-to-parliament-say-stir-on/articleshow/87955630.cms||Vishwa Mohan

She grew up to conquer some of the toughest ones like the Nanda Devi and Mount Everest. The 62-year-old has scaled another peak. She has become the first woman in the history of the Indian Mountaineering Foundation to become its president. The award-winning climber, educationist and environmentalist got 70 out of 107 votes in the 60-year-old organisation's polls to clinch the top post, breaking a “snow ceiling” as some of her contemporaries joked. IMF is the apex body for mountaineering and allied sports activities in the country. “As IMF president my priority will be to encourage more girls to take up climbing,” Bisht said. “We will focus on promoting activities like sport climbing, which was recently included as an Olympic event. We will also emphasise on mountaineering policies, disaster management and coordination with other training institutes.” After completing her BA and MA in economics, Bisht joined the Nehru Institute of Mountaineering in Uttarkashi from where she did a course in climbing in 1975. In 1981, she became one of the first three women to scale the main peak of Nanda Devi. That year she won the Arjuna award for mountaineering. Three years later, in 1984, she summited the Everest. It was during this expedition that she came across the work of Edmund Hillary in conserving mountains and wanted to follow that path. She then founded the ‘Save Gangotri Project’ to safeguard the region around the origin of the Ganga. In 1991, she started a campaign to preserve Bhojpatra trees, a species native to the Himalayas, and planted hundreds of saplings in the Gangotri national park region. For this, she was awarded the Edmund Hillary Mountain Legacy medal in 2013.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/snow-ceiling-cracks-as-imf-gets-woman-chief/articleshow/87955663.cms||Abhyudaya Kotnala

A stroll along the popular Calangute-Baga stretch reveals that shacks now have a lounge-like facility with sofas, fancy lighting, hookahs, live DJs, as well as selfie-friendly “installations” for tourists inclined towards social media. The winds of change first blew along the beach stretches of Calangute and Baga, and these trends are eventually adopted by shacks on other beaches in the state, albeit with slightly lesser grandeur. As shacks opened this season after around a year and a half of bad business, the competition for customers is intense. Colourful lights shine bright, luring customers walking along the beach. Once in, the customers find that the usual hard chairs have been replaced by sofas — at added cost, of course. A shack operator in Calangute said he has paid Rs 2 lakh to have seven sofas installed, and that guests using this lounge facility need to raise a minimum bill of Rs 4,000. “There is so much competition, I had to have sofas, and to recover the cost, I have to charge extra. It’s not that I don’t take in customers who will just have a few beers and whose bill is less than Rs 1,000. They can always use a humble table if their spending capacity is low.” The operator has instructed his waiters to inform customers using the lounge that their bills need to be more than Rs 4,000, to avoid any misunderstanding later. “Probably, by next season, all shacks will have sofas, and we will not be able to charge more,” he said. However, what’s really striking at Calangute and Baga is the lighting decor by shacks. Apart from some being “decorated like Christmas trees”, others have electrified installations in the shapes of hearts, balloons, and coconut trees, sometimes along the entire area in front of the shack. While the jury is out on whether lightning actually does make shacks more beautiful or attract customers, there is no doubt that the electrified installations serve as an important backdrop for tourists to click selfies — the heart shaped ‘I Love Goa’ being an enduring favourite. Most operators declined to be named, as some have rented their shacks. Some shacks have hired DJs to draw a crowd.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/from-lounges-to-live-djs-goa-beach-shacks-up-their-game/articleshow/87955744.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||India||Need to ponder, why it is difficult to implement law passed by Parliament: Union minister Rijiju||NEW DELHI: Union law minister Kiren Rijiju on Saturday, without referring to farm laws in the presence of CJI N V Ramana and President Ram Nath Kovind, said just like a judgment passed by the Supreme Court, a bill passed by the Parliament is also law of the land and need to ponder why it is difficult to implement. He was speaking at the second day of the valedictory ceremony of Constitution Day celebrations. “We can’t see such a situation when the government or court takes a decision. When the SC delivers a judgment, it is the law of the land. Likewise, when Parliament or Assembly passes a law, that is also a law of the land.” He emphasized that how can a situation arise where a judgment or law passed by the Supreme Court, high courts, Assembly and Parliament, becomes difficult to implement. “Then we have to ponder about it. Whether it is legislature, judiciary or executive or any part of the society. Still, we have to think. Because we are following the Constitution and the country is also going by the Constitution”, he said. Rijiju also pointed out that he is observing a trend, where some people are too conscious of their rights and do anything to get their rights, but at the same time they forget the rights of others and some also forget their duties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/need-to-ponder-why-it-is-difficult-to-implement-law-passed-by-parliament-union-minister-rijiju/articleshow/87955762.cms||---

He also highlighted that simply re-branding the existing courts as commercial courts, without creating a special infrastructure, will not have any impact on the pendency. Addressing judges and lawyers, CJI Ramana said, "We must remember that whatever criticism or obstacle that we may encounter, our mission to render justice cannot stop. We have to march on in pursuing our duty to strengthen the judiciary and protect the rights of the citizenry." The CJI, who was speaking at the valedictory ceremony of Constitution Day celebrations in the presence of President Ram Nath Kovind and Union Law Minister Kiren Rijiju, said the issue of pendency of cases in the judiciary is multi-faceted in nature and hoped that the government would take into consideration the suggestions received during this two-day programme and resolve the prevailing issues. "Another issue is that the legislature does not conduct studies or assess the impact of the laws that it passes. This sometimes leads to big issues. The introduction of section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is an example of this. Now, the already-burdened magistrates are further burdened by thousands of these cases. Similarly, re-branding the existing courts as commercial courts, without creating a special infrastructure, will not have any impact on the pendency," he said. Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act deals with dishonour of cheques for insufficiency of funds in bank accounts. The CJI lauded the announcement of the Union law minister that the government has allocated Rs 9,000 crore, a substantial amount, for the development of judicial infrastructure. "However, as I have highlighted yesterday, funds are not the problem. The problem is with some of the states not coming forward to match the grants. As a result, the central funds largely remain unutilised," he said. "That is the reason why I am proposing a special purpose vehicle of judicial infrastructure authority. I beseech the minister to take this proposal to a logical conclusion. I also urge the minister to expedite the process of filling judicial vacancies," the CJI said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/legislature-doesnt-assess-law-impact-leads-to-big-issues-cji/articleshow/87955770.cms||---

Yadav then directed the crime branch, which is probing the matter, to review it and submit a report, the official added. “If it is found that the accused persons deliberately attempted to spread rumour and disturb communal harmony, police will deal with the cases with a firm hand. “If enough evidence is not found, the cases may be dropped,” he said.

India Meteorological Department said a low-pressure system is likely to develop over south Andaman Sea around November 29-30. “There a good consensus in weather models that this low-pressure system will intensify into some sort of a cyclonic storm. But we will have to wait a few days for the low pressure to form before getting more clarity,” said IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra. This year, no cyclonic storm formed over the Bay of Bengal in October and November, generally the peak months for cyclones in the region. The last such storm over the bay was cyclone Gulab in late September when the southwest monsoon was still active over the region. Cyclone Gulab made landfall over north Andhra Pradesh on September 26. Later, the remnants of the storm entered the Arabian Sea and intensified into a severe cyclone, Shaheen. As of now, the European weather model (ECMWF) predicts that the cyclone would make landfall over north coastal Andhra Pradesh and recurve thereafter, moving over Odisha, Jharkhand and Bengal. The American GFS model, however, forecasts that the cyclone would recurve over the sea near north Andhra Pradesh and move towards Bengal. “In either case, from the models it appears that Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Jharkhand and Bengal are likely to get good rainfall in the first week of December,” Mohapatra said. Wet weather is also likely over the west coast, particularly Maharashtra and Gujarat, from around December 1. Some models forecast the formation of a low pressure/depression over the Arabian Sea heading towards south Gujarat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cyclone-over-bay-of-bengal-likely-next-week/articleshow/87955816.cms||Amit Bhattacharya
---||India||SC commutes 2 murderers’ death sentence||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court commuted capital punishment to a 30-year jail term for two persons convicted of killing eight persons in Jharkhand in 2007. This comes a fortnight after the court held that capital punishment should not be awarded when there is hope for “reformation and rehabilitation” of a convict and commuted death sentence to life imprisonment in a case of rape and murder of a five-year-old girl. “It is well-settled law that the possibility of reformation and rehabilitation of the convict is an important factor, which has to be taken into account as a mitigating circumstance before sentencing him to death. There is a bounden duty cast on the courts to elicit information of all the relevant factors and consider those regarding the possibility of reformation, even if the accused remains silent,” a bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao, B R Gavai and B V Nagarathna said. The bench said none of the courts from trial court to Supreme Court explored the possibility of reformation of the convict and sentence of death was imposed by taking into account the brutality of the crime. It allowed the review petition of the convict pleading the court to re-examine its verdict to award the death sentence. “We have examined the socio-economic background of the petitioners, the absence of any criminal antecedents, affidavits filed by their family and community members with whom they continue to share emotional ties and the certificate issued by the jail superintendent on their conduct during their long incarceration of 14 years. Considering all of the above, it cannot be said that there is no possibility of reformation of the petitioners, foreclosing the alternative option of a lesser sentence and making the imposition of death sentence imperative. Therefore, we convert the sentence imposed on the petitioners from death to life,” it said. “However, keeping in mind the gruesome murder of the entire family of their sibling in a pre-planned manner without provocation due to a property dispute, we are of the opinion that the petitioners deserve a sentence of a period of 30 years,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-commutes-2-murderers-death-sentence/articleshow/87955821.cms||---

Those who have flown in from these three countries in the past 15 days — between November 12 and 27 — will be traced and subjected to repeat tests, said a circular. Students who have come from Kerala in the past 16 days will be subjected to Covid tests again even if they have already reported negative, revenue minister R Ashoka said. Also, RT-PCR negative reports have been made mandatory for those travelling from Kerala and Maharashtra. Int’l travellers testing +ve to be shifted to Covid hospitalPassengers from South Africa, Botswana and Hong Kong will be allowed to leave the airport only if they turn negative for Covid following tests on arrival at the airport. “International passengers testing positive will be shifted to a designated Covid hospital and their genomic sequencing will be done on priority,” said health department officers. Those testing negative have to follow home quarantine rules and undergo testing on day 7 of arrival. The meeting chaired by the CM discussed rise in Covid clusters. Revenue minister R Ashoka said: “We have tightened the vigil in districts bordering Kerala and Maharashtra. It is mandatory for those from these states to produce RT-PCR reports.” Colleges have been directed not to organise group activities now. No Omicron cases so farThe government said no Omicron variant cases have been reported in the state. In November so far, 93 people from South Africa arrived at Bengaluru airport, of whom two tested positive. While one landed in Bengaluru prior to the new variant’s discovery, the other, a 66-yearold man, arrived on November 20. The man has no symptoms . “The genomic sequencing of both patients has confirmed they were infected with the Delta variant. They have no Omicron variant,” said BBMP health commissioner KV Trilok Chandra. On Saturday, the government ramped up daily testing — from 60,000 to 80,000 across the state and from 25,000 to 30,000 in Bengaluru Urban .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-to-trace-test-pax-from-3-at-risk-nations/articleshow/87955859.cms||Sunitha Rao R

The corresponding ratio was 910:1000 in NFHS-4, showing a clear increase in female birth ratio by 68 over five years. The improvement has been attributed to strict implementation of the Pre-Conception and Prenatal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act and the Bhagyalakshmi scheme that provides financial aid to the girl child. The NHFS-5 sex ratio data at birth shows 1,063 females are born for every 1,000 males in urban areas, against 931 females for 1,000 males in rural areas. The corresponding data in NFHS-4 2015-16 was 874 female babies in urban areas and 934 in rural areas. ‘PCPNDT Act, girls’ scheme helped’While the sex ratio at birth in urban areas has seen an increase in the recent survey, there’s a slight decline in rural areas. However, the overall sex ratio of the population in Karnataka is 1,034 females for every 1,000 males. The ratio of population under 7 years is lower at 953 females per 1,000 males. Health department authorities say the Pre-Conception and Prenatal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act enacted in 1994 and amended in 2003 has been an important tool for addressing sex selective elimination. Effective implementation of the Act that prevents gender detection of female foeticide is a major factor, apart from implementation of Bhagyalakshmi scheme in Karnataka from 2006-07. The scheme provides financial security for every girl child born in priority households (earlier referred to as below poverty line families). “Bhagyalakshmi is definitely one of our most important schemes. Earlier, it was implemented through LIC, and now through Sukanya Arogya Suraksha scheme of India Post. It has helped increase sex ratio at birth, and also helps in girl child education. The government has also ensured that every child is in school,” said Uma Mahadevan, principal secretary, women and child welfare department. “Wherever I go in rural Karnataka and interact with poor families, they are very particular their daughters have to be educated like their sons. It’s heartening,” said Mahadevan. Highest in Kodagu, lowest in RamanagaraThe sex ratio at birth in Karnataka is highest in Kodagu with 1,190, followed by Bengaluru Rural 1,177, Ballari 1,072, and Bengaluru 1,063, as per NFHS-5 data. It is least in Ramanagara 781 followed by Davanagere 797. Some districts have seen a decline. In Ramanagara, the sex ratio at birth was 928 in 2005-6, and now reduced to 781. Ditto with Chamarajangar where it has declined to 953 in 2019-20, from 1,141 of 2015-16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/govt-scheme-pndt-act-improve-sex-ratio-in-state/articleshow/87955860.cms||Sunitha Rao R

Fans were worried about the five goals BFC conceded in two games but on Saturday BFC coach Marco Pezzaiuoli reposed faith in his team's defence. "Our defence was good against Odisha and the goals we conceded were because of individual errors. (Sometimes) you make mistakes and so we have to see the good things too. Odisha almost had no opportunities in the game," the Italian said. Even in the opening win against NorthEast United FC, Bengaluru conceded two goals but the coach backed his defenders to continue their good work. "Despite conceding an early goal (against Odisha), we came back and totally dominated the game. We lost because of three individual mistakes. We played better with the ball than against NorthEast and we have improved our defence,” Pezzaiuoli told reporters in a virtual interaction. Against Blasters, who held NorthEast goalless in the last match after losing to ATK Mohun Bagan in the opener, BFC will look to cut down on the mistakes and make most of their chances. Skipper Sunil Chhetri, who missed a penalty against Odisha, will be keen to open his account while goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu will be eyeing an improved performance.STOMACH BUG SCAREThe BFC coach also said there is a question mark over the availability of a few players for Sunday's clash after they were down with a stomach bug. "Five-six players have got a problem (stomach bug) and we are not sure who will be fit for the match. There is a question mark (about their availability) and we have to see tomorrow morning,” he said.Today’s match: Bengaluru FC vs Kerala Blasters, 7.30 pm (Live Star Sports).Result: East Bengal lost to Mohun Bagan 3 (Krishna 12, Manvir 14, Colaco 23).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bfc-look-for-improved-show-against-blasters/articleshow/87955861.cms||---

K Seeta, who was from Mantralaya, Kurnool district in Andhra Pradesh, went missing from Ramamohanpura in Rajajinagar on March 26. “Seeta had come to our sister’s house four months ago. She went out for some work and didn’t return,” her younger brother Venkatesh Achar, a priest at a temple in Mantralaya, told Subramanyanagar police. Cops visited the houses of Seeta’s friends and relatives in Mantralaya and elsewhere but couldn’t trace her. Last week, Achar told Subramanyanagar police a few men from Mantralaya and other places abducted him and later released him only after getting his signature on a property document. The document read that Achar and his siblings had sold their two-acre ancestral property in Mantralaya to them and the men were selling it to a third party. “Achar was not sure whether the property document had names and signatures of his siblings. He suspected foul play as the document date indicated it had been prepared around the time when Seeta went missing. Achar suspected his abductors could be linked with Seeta’s disappearance,” an officer said. Kidnapped to get signaturePolice detained two suspects and they spilled the beans. “They kidnapped Seeta in a car from Bengaluru on March 26 to get her signature on the document. They travelled towards Hospet and forcibly took her signature. They then made her swallow a cyanide-filled capsule and threw her body into a canal near Hospet. We need to question more persons to get clarity on the case,” a police officer said, adding they will search the canal shortly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cops-ap-priests-missing-sis-killed-over-property-row/articleshow/87955862.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

Preliminary investigation revealed the accused would send question papers with answers of previous years’ exams to the beneficiaries and send the answerscripts back to these boards/universities. After a while, the beneficiaries would receive their markscards. The accused are Rakesh M, 37, and K Krishna, 27, both from Kempapura in Hebbal, Hyder Ali, 37, from HRBR Layout and Tanmay Debroy, a native of Sikkim. They fixed the price for class X markscard at Rs 20,000, class 12 at Rs 25,000 and degree at Rs 40,000. Manukumar HS, a social worker, on November 18 filed a complaint against Rakesh and Krishna, accusing them of offering markscards for money. A probe ended with the arrests and cops seizing 558 markscards (from class 10 to final-year degree) of different boards/universities. They were meant to be delivered to beneficiaries who had already paid.  The FIR says Rakesh and Krishna ran Dream Education Services in Kempapura and offered different courses. “I visited Dream Education Services with a friend, and Rakesh with Krishna offered me degree markscards of private varsities and sought money,” the FIR quoted Manukumar as saying. DCP (northeast) CK Baba said they will visit the universities to learn more about the racket since they strongly suspect the markscards were issued from the boards and varsities themselves. “Markscards of class 10 and class 12 boards of Kerala, UP, Tamil Nadu, Delhi and other places were seized from Dream Education Services. Degree markscards of the following varsities were also seized: IEC University (HP), Chaudhary Charan Singh University (UP), Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Majaraj University (UP), Mahamaya University (Delhi), William Carey University (Meghalaya), Kalinga University (Chhattisgharh), Pondicherry University (Puducherry), Sikkim State University (Sikkim), University of Allahabad (UP), Periyar University (TN), and Kuvempu University, Bangalore University and Karnataka State Open University (Karnataka),” Baba said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/4-who-offered-degree-markscards-for-40k-nabbed-558-docus-seized/articleshow/87955863.cms||Rajiv Kalkod
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru case probe leads to Rs 3.7 crore foreign notes haul at Mumbai||BENGALURU: A probe which began after foreign notes worth Rs 1 crore hidden in a mixie were detected at Kempegowda International Airport on October 1 led to a mega seizure of foreign currency worth Rs 3.7 crore at Mumbai airport. The notes were concealed in four suitcases with false bottoms. The Mumbai incident is among four large currency smuggling attempts foiled by Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) with specific intelligence from Bengaluru informers. On October 1, two Tamil Nadu men who were to take a flight to Dubai were nabbed at KIA after they attempted to smuggle a white mixie. Most of its internal parts were removed and it was packed with US dollars, UAE dirham and Saudi riyal. Investigators suspected the duo carrying the foreign currency worth Rs 1 crore had links to a few terror outfits operating from the Gulf and the money could be for them. The DRI Bengaluru unit began a probe and christened it Operation Cheque Shirts to track hawala deals and foreign currency smuggling through various key airports in the country mainly to the Gulf, sources said. Following the KIA bust, DRI sleuths made two more foreign currency seizures in different parts of the country within 50 days. The Bengaluru investigators received specific information about a fourth case, wherein a Delhi-based gang would attempt to smuggle currency via Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport early on Friday. According to sources, the DRI Mumbai sleuths were tipped off by their Bengaluru counterparts and soon intercepted two Sharjah-bound passengers carrying four suitcases. Examination of the suitcases revealed all four had false bottoms that were tightly fixed using nuts and bolts. The luggage was dismantled and sleuths found many 100 dollar bills (US) and a few notes of Saudi riyal. It was ascertained that the duo, residents of Delhi, was attempting to smuggle foreign currency worth Rs 3.7 crore to the UAE. The two men were not carrying any legal documents pertaining to the cash and were booked under section 110 of the Customs Act 1962. Further probe is under way to find out about their connections to Bengaluru gangs, sources added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/city-case-probe-leads-to-3-7cr-foreign-notes-haul-at-mumbai/articleshow/87955864.cms||Petlee Peter

Apart from bearing the financial burden of two Covid tests, some have been denied boarding despite testing negative in both, on the grounds that their RT-PCR report was more than two days old. Mohan from HRBR Layout was to take a flight to Dubai from Kempegowda International Airport on Friday. “I underwent an RT-PCR test two days before the flight and paid Rs 1,200. I reached Bengaluru airport six hours before departure and took a rapid-PCR test at a kiosk by paying Rs 3,000. But the airline ground staff didn’t allow me to board stating that the previous 72-hour validity for the RT-PCR report has been altered to 48 hours by the UAE authorities. Me and many other Dubai-bound passengers didn’t even get an alert from the airline,” said the 58-year-old engineer who was forced to reschedule his tickets. “Even if you test negative in the rapid-PCR test conducted six hours prior to departure at the airport, you still can be denied boarding on the grounds that your previous RT-PCR report has crossed the 48-hour validity period. There is absolutely no logic in this rule which airlines are blindly following,” said Thabassuum, another Dubai-bound passenger who was not permitted to board. Most affected passengers in Bengaluru and others planning trips to UAE have expressed displeasure on social media, saying the two-test rule applies only to flyers from India and a few other Asian countries, including Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Indonesia. According to an Air India ground staffer at KIA, arguments with UAE-bound flyers over the test results have become a daily occurrence at check-in counters. “We feel the pre-departure Covid test would be sufficient as passengers landing from Dubai, Sharjah and other airports in UAE will undergo another round of Covid testing and go into home quarantine till the result is sent to them. We expect the UAE government will do away with the double-testing requirement, which will save Indian flyers and ground staff a lot of trouble,” the senior staffer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/double-test-norm-troubles-passengers-heading-to-uae/articleshow/87955866.cms||Petlee Peter
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: MLC poll campaign hots up||BENGALURU: With the last date for withdrawal of nominations over, campaigning for elections to 25 legislative council seats has gained momentum. Candidates of all parties have begun reaching out to voters, who are members of rural and urban local bodies, personally as well as through conventions. While chief minister Basavaraj Bommai launched the party’s campaign on Friday from Tumakuru, his cabinet colleagues and MLAs will hit the campaign trail from Sunday. The BJP, which is contesting 20 seats, is under pressure to win at least 13 to get a simple majority in the 75-member house. Falling short of this goal means the party will have to be at the mercy of the Congress and JD(S) to get important bills passed in the upper house.  Opposition leader Siddaramaiah, KPCC president DK Shivakumar and other senior functionaries will also start campaigning for Congress candidates from Monday. According to sources, the party has drawn up a tour programme of both the senior leaders. The party wants to win more seats in these elections and thereby create a tempo in its favour ahead of the assembly elections. “The poll results will have no immediate political implications, but it will definitely help gauge the mood of voters besides setting the tone for the assembly elections which are just one-and-a-half years away. So the party will make an all-out effort to win as many seats as possible,” said a Congress functionary. Meanwhile, Shivakumar met SR Patil, opposition leader in the legislative council, on Friday night to assuage the latter’s hurt feelings. Patil has been sulking ever since the party denied him a ticket to contest the polls from Vijayapura. After the meeting, Patil said he would abide by the party’s decision and work for the candidates’ victory in the council elections. “The Congress is like a mother to me and I’ll follow whatever decision the party has taken. I’ll never ever go against it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/mlc-poll-campaign-hots-up/articleshow/87955867.cms||---

For example, while Dakshina Kannada has a green cover of close to 70%, Vijayapura, Bidar, etc have less than 10%,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/increase-green-cover-by-30-min/articleshow/87955869.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||‘Survey officer’ held for duping people with plum govt jobs in Karnataka||BENGALURU: Central Crime Branch sleuths arrested a 39-year-old man, who used to be a land surveyor, on the charge of cheating people after promising to get them government jobs. The accused, Raghavendra BG alias Raghav, is a resident of JP Nagar and native of Kundapur, Udupi. He claimed to be ‘deputy development commissioner’ with ‘Government of India-Survey of India’ and even showed his victims an ID card with designation. According to police sources, the licence plates of his two cars also had GOI logo. His victims filed cheating cases in Bengaluru (JP Nagar and Yeshwantpur), Haveri, Karwar, Bagalkot and other places. “Raghavendra took at least Rs 10 lakh from each victim along with two blank cheques and an empty bond paper signed by them. He claimed the cheques were necessary to open salary account while the bond paper was needed for filing an affidavit in the victim’s name when the job was ready,” an investigating officer said. Filed cheque-bounce cases to silence victimsThe victims, after waiting for long and realising Raghavendra had cheated them, called him asking for their money back. When Raghavendra sensed they were about to approach police, he deposited one of the cheques with a large sum to ensure it would bounce. Then, seeking an advocate’s help, he filed a cheque-bounce case against the victim. On the empty bond paper, he would mention that the victim had taken a loan of Rs 20 lakh from him. “These tactics almost succeeded in stopping many victims from filing police complaints. However, a few did so even after Raghavendra filed cheque-bounce cases,” the officer said. “Till now, he is understood to have duped around 30 persons. We suspect there are more victims and request them to contact police.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/survey-officer-held-for-duping-people-with-plum-govt-jobs/articleshow/87955870.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Soon, private companies can get govt data on students, farmers||BENGALURU: The government will soon allow private firms to access “specific” data about farmers and students for a “nominal” fee under the e-Sahamati framework. With data the next big precious commodity, the state is positioning itself as a pioneer in the country to usher in digital transformation while keeping open the option to monetise data. However, questions remain on safety. The e-Sahamati platform aims to connect companies with data fiduciaries (portals and data sets vested with different government departments), allowing private firms “controlled access” to the information. For example, the government has information on 75 lakh farmers across the state and details of crops they grow every season. If an agriculture produce aggregator or a retailer wishes to secure data on the number of farmers growing a particular vegetable in a particular area, e-Sahamati will give access details of farmers and their produce. Similarly, if an IT firm wants to hire an engineer with a specific skillset or top 10% of some 75 lakh engineering degree holders, the platform will provide access to names and contacts of students with relevant skillset. This information will be subject to consent from students; they must agree to share their mark sheets and personal information with companies for job prospects. Since the datasets will be authenticated by government departments and universities and include a digital signature, the move will weed out middlemen and fake certification. However, every private company that intends to access this data must procure a licence from the state. Sources say the state government has decided to charge a one-time fee of Rs 50,000 per company. “If we levy a higher fee, it will automatically be transferred to its clientele. In this case, it may be a farmer selling produce or a student seeking a job. We don’t intend to tax people,” said a senior government official. The government will reserve the right to monetise the information by levying a higher fee or a yearly amount later. With the election code of conduct in place, the government is likely to onboard private companies on e-Sahamati after December 10 when elections to the legislative council are over. At present, the government is framing rules and regulations which will include details on the licence and fees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/soon-pvt-cos-can-get-govt-data-on-students-farmers/articleshow/87955871.cms||Sandeep Moudgal
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: After hitting all-time high, tomato prices nosedive||BENGALURU: Tomato prices, which spiralled out of control and left consumers burdened, dropped drastically in Bengaluru on Saturday following an increase in supplies from other parts of the country. A 15kg box of tomatoes was being sold for Rs 400-600 from an all-time high of Rs 3,100 a few days ago. In the retail market, the price of one kg of tomato hovered around Rs 50-70 on Saturday as compared to Rs 110-130 five days ago. While the price drop has brought relief to consumers, who are already suffering because of skyrocketing fuel rates, the question being asked by many was: How did tomato prices crash? Those tracking vegetable prices said: “The prices shot up following heavy rain in tomato-growing districts around Bengaluru such as Kolar and Chikkaballapur and the bordering areas of Tamil Nadu. The price of a 15kg box touched Rs 1,400-1,600 and quickly climbed to over Rs 3,000 as supply was short in the market. Videos of tomato auctions shot by a few traders went viral and drew the attention of tomato growers in north Karnataka districts and neighbouring Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. Many traders and farmers diverted their produce to the Bengaluru market, hoping to get higher price and, as a result, the supply went up and the market saw price correction.” Meanwhile, there has been no rain in south-interior Karnataka for the past two days and locally produced tomatoes have started coming to the market. “Right now, only Kolar farmers are getting tomatoes to the market and the price is Rs 600-800 per box,” said Rajendra, tomato dealer at KR Market. If rain doesn’t continue, prices are likely to reduce to Rs 20-40 per kg in the coming days, traders said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/after-hitting-all-time-high-tomato-prices-nosedive/articleshow/87955872.cms||---

Announcing the project, V Nagaraj, secretary of Mythic Society, emphasised the need to save inscriptions and ensure they are available for future generations. The project will be implemented by Udaya Kumar PL, a citizen historian who has been working on Bengaluru inscriptions for few years now. He said it is essential to utilise 3D technology to digitally scan inscriptions as almost 40% of stone inscriptions in BBMP limits have been destroyed in the past few decades as a result of lack of awareness and rapid urbanisation. According to Mythic Society experts, Bengaluru is a unique global city with thousands of years of history recorded in the form of inscriptions. About 175 inscriptions dating from CE 750 have been found and over 75 rare stone inscriptions have been destroyed in the past few decades. Said to be the first of its kind in India, the 3D scanning process is expected to scan all stone inscriptions discovered in Bengaluru, Bengaluru Rural and Ramanagara in the last 150 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/mythic-society-to-preserve-175-city-inscriptions-in-3d/articleshow/87955873.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Many passengers feel pinch of app-based cabs, want meter taxis||BENGALURU: With Bengalureans on the move again, the demand for cabs is back. But a combination of shortage of cabs, fare hike and drivers refusing to ply has many seeking meter taxis. In cities such as New York, media reports say many passengers are returning to yellow taxis because of cab shortage and price hike in app-based cabs. In Bengaluru, many drivers found other jobs during the pandemic and are not ready to drive cabs because of soaring diesel prices. “It is difficult to get a cab now, especially during peak hours and when it rains. If we manage to get one, either it will be too expensive or the driver will refuse to come. It’s high time we had yellow taxis here as in Kolkata and Mumbai,” said Revathy Krishnan, a cab user from Koramangala. The roads of Bengaluru used to see the traditional Ambassador and Premier Padmini taxis painted black and yellow several years ago. K Radhakrishna Holla, president of Karnataka State Travel Operators’ Association, said, “Bengaluru had black-and-yellow taxis, especially in places like City and Cantonment railway stations, Gandhi Bazaar and Brigade Road. But this more or less stopped after HAL airport stopped operations in 2008 and Ola and Uber cabs hit the road.” Drivers unhappyTanveer Pasha, president of Ola, Taxi for Sure and Uber Owners and Drivers’ Association, said, “We have been requesting the government to give permission to install meters in taxis for the past two years. Transport officials say ride-hailing is outdated and app based booking is the most advanced way. But the government is also not ready to launch an app even as most drivers don’t want to work with Ola and Uber because of reduced incentives" L Hemanth Kumar, additional commissioner for transport and secretary, state transport authority, said, “We will consider installing meters in cabs if drivers come forward. Let there be a consensus among them on this. We don’t have any opposition.”According to Holla, many drivers refuse trips because of damaged roads, especially during rain, and traffic congestion. Transport officials said most cabs associated with Ola and Uber have state contract permits and only city taxi permit holders such as Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation (KSTDC) and Meru cabs have meter taxis. KSTDC airport taxis, for instance, are fitted with GPS-enabled machines that allow tracking and issue receipts at the end of journey. Mumbai’s black-and-yellow taxis and Kolkata’s yellow taxis are popular. The West Bengal government also rolled out no-refusal taxis (blue and white) in Kolkata. In Dubai, all taxis are equipped with smart digital meters that have cashless payment and GPS navigation features.However, some Bengalureans are skeptical. “If meter taxis are allowed, they will also be like our auto drivers who refuse to ply or demand extra. What we need is enforcement of fares fixed by the government,” said Mahalakshmi R, a passenger. Increase in complaintsOla and Uber rolled into Bengaluru in 2012-13 and made commuting seamless, providing passengers relief from unchecked auto drivers. However, the honeymoon period appears to be over with passenger complaints increasing, especially in recent years. Many passengers say neither traffic police nor the transport department is taking action against errant cab operators. Ola and Uber were unavailable for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/many-passengers-feel-pinch-of-app-based-cabs-want-meter-taxis/articleshow/87955874.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

TOI had carried an article, ‘Contractors accused of cheating Metro workers’, on Saturday. “Outsourced service contracts for housekeeping, security and ticketing are awarded through open tender in a transparent manner. Payments are made to contractors on a monthly basis as per the Minimum Wages Act, as stipulated in the contract. These payments are checked to ensure attendance is correct, payment to employees is worked out correctly and statutory payments such as PF, ESI and professional tax are remitted to the respective authorities,” BMRCL said. The agency explained that to facilitate timely payments to outsourced employees by service contractors, 80% of the invoice amount is paid to the contractor on submission of invoice and certification of attendance. “The remaining 20% is paid after ensuring that payment to employees is made through bank accounts and statutory amounts are remitted,” it said. The TOI article had highlighted that many Metro workers, especially those engaged in housekeeping, security and ticket office machine work, were being paid less than what they were entitled to because of alleged irregularities by contractors. A former BMRCL employee had alleged there was no system to ascertain if employees were getting what was promised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bmrcl-urges-employees-to-flag-their-grievances/articleshow/87955875.cms||---

Playing with a lot more confidence after her narrow quarterfinal win on Friday, the top Indian amateur was up and running straightaway, taking a 3-up lead by the fifth hole with birdies on the first, second and fifth holes — where she holed a putt from outside the green.She lost the sixth hole after finding the left trees with her driver and ending up with a bogey five. The ninth standard student of Greenwood High International School quickly put that blemish behind her and went 6-up by the 12th hole to take a vice-like grip over the proceedings.Saanvi pulled one back with a birdie on the 13th hole, which Avani missed by a whisker. The top seed, winner of two Women’s Pro Golf Tour events this season, bogeyed the 14th following a wayward drive, but sealed the match 4 & 3 after halving the 15th hole.Results (Semifinals): 1-Avani Prashanth (Blr) bt 20-Saanvi Somu (Blr) 4 & 3; 10-Kriti Chouhan (Jpr) bt 6-Sneha Singh (Hyd) 5 & 3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/avani-a-win-away-from-double/articleshow/87955876.cms||---
---||India||Bihar’s share of poor highest, Kerala’s least, says Niti index||NEW DELHI: Bihar, with its dismal scores across key development indicators such as nutrition, child and adolescent mortality, maternal health, years of schooling, sanitation and electricity, has topped the list of states with the largest share of population who are poor, according to think tank Niti Aayog’s report, which has identified 25.01% of the country’s population as “multi-dimensionally poor”. More than 50% of Bihar’s population has been classified as poor under the national Multi-dimensional Poverty Index (MPI), followed by Jharkhand (42.2%), Uttar Pradesh (37.8%), Madhya Pradesh (36.7%) and Meghalaya (32.7%). Kerala has the least number of poor with only 0.7% of its population classified as such. Among the Union territories, 27.4% of Dadra and Nagar Haveli’s population is poor, according to the MPI parameters. “The headcount ratio answers the question: ‘How many are poor?’ India’s national MPI identifies 25.01% of the population as multi-dimensionally poor,” the report. The headcount ratio measures the multi-dimensionally poor in the total population. The data showed 51.9% of the population in Bihar is deprived of nutrition, followed by Jharkhand (47.8%), MP (45.5%) and Uttar Pradesh (44.5%). Sikkim has the lowest percentage of population deprived of nutrition at 13.3%. According to the report, a household is considered deprived if any child between the ages of 0 to 59 months, or woman between the ages of 15 to 49 years or man between the ages of 15 to 54 years — for whom nutritional information is available — is found to be undernourished. The national MPI baseline report based on the National Family Health Survey-4 (2015-16) has been developed by Niti Aayog in consultation with 12 ministries and in partnership with state governments and the index publishing agencies — Oxford University’s Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Uttar Pradesh is on top of the list with a population of nearly 5% categorised as deprived under child and adolescent mortality, followed by Bihar (4.6%), Madhya Pradesh (3.6%), Chattisgrah ( 3.3%) and Jharkhand (3.3%). Under maternal health, Bihar tops the chart with 45.6% categorised as deprived, followed by UP (35.5%), Jharkhand (33.1%) and Nagaland (33.1%). Among UTs, Delhi has a share of 15.2% of the population categorised as deprived under maternal health. A household is deprived if any woman in the family, who has given birth in the five years preceding the survey, has not received at least four ante-natal care visits for the most recent birth, or has not received aid rom medical personnel during the most recent childbirth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bihars-share-of-poor-highest-keralas-least-says-niti-index/articleshow/87955888.cms||---

Tobacco usage among males across India was at 38% with men in rural areas accounting for 42.7% of users. The urban users of tobacco among men and women accounted for 28.8% and 5.4% respectively. As far as alcohol consumption goes, nearly 19% of the males who were 15 and above said that they consume liquor. In rural areas 19.9% of the males surveyed consume alcohol and this percentage was 16.5% in urban India. Overall just 1.3% women admitted to drinking. The data on tobacco and alcohol consumption was collected for the first time in NFHS-5 and enables a gender perspective on the issue. The survey draws attention to health issues like obesity and high risk populations among both men and women and how medical check-ups for preventable and treatable (if detected early) cancers remains very low. When women aged 30 to 49 years were asked if they had ever undergone a screening test for cervical cancer, the survey found just 1.9% such women who responded in the affirmative. The percentage was even smaller when women were asked if they had ever undergone a breast examination for breast cancer. In urban areas this percentage was 1.2% and it was 0.7% in rural areas. Overall it came to a mere 0.9%. Reflecting how lifestyle is affecting health and adding to the disease load, data on nutritional status of adults aged 15-49 years shows that one in four women compared to one in five in 2015-16 were either overweight or obese. A significantly high 56.7% have a high risk waist-to-hip ratio. The percentage of overweight or obese men has gone up to 22.9% in NFHS-5 compared to 18.9% in NFHS-4. The percentage for men having a high risk waist-to-hip ratio is 47.7%. NFHS-5 reflects information gathered across many indicators from 6,36,699 households, 7,24,115 women, and 1,01,839 men. The fieldwork for India was conducted in two phases: phase one from June 2019 to January end in 2020 and phase two from January 2020 to April end in 2021. Last year, data on 17 states and five UTs was released and now data on 11 states and three states has been put out along with the India factsheets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/almost-one-in-10-women-aged-15-above-a-tobacco-user-nfhs/articleshow/87955912.cms||Ambika Pandit

The mosque is close to the Krishna Janmasthan temple. “Section 144 is already in force in the district,” said SSP (Mathura) Guarav Grover. “Strict action will be taken against those found indulging in rumour mongering or trying to disrupt the peaceful atmosphere of the town. We have received information that some organisations are trying to hold an event or a foot march (to the idgah) on December 6.” The SSP has appealed to people to work with police in maintaining law and order. The administration has also established communication with members of the minority community to instil confidence. “No one will be allowed to do any mischief,” said circle officer (city) Abhishek Tewari, who interacted with minority community leaders in Mathura and assured them that the administration has put safeguards in place. The threat to perform the “ritual” at the idgah has come at a time when a local court is hearing a bunch of petitions seeking “removal” of the 17th century mosque. Police, however, said no permission for any programme has been issued and none will be granted. Members of the Quami Ekta Manch in Mathura have urged chief minister Yogi Adityanath to provide additional security on December 6. Founder of the Manch, Madhuvan Dutt Chaturvedi, said it has been 53 years since an agreement was signed between the managements of the Shahi Idgah and Sri Krishna Janmasthan Sansthan to maintain status quo. “We can't let that break,” he said. Recently, the All India Teerth Purohit Mahasabha, a 60-year-old body of over 90 temple priests from across India, said that this issue is being raked up unnecessarily and that all concerned parties should be all the more careful as assembly polls are just around the corner in UP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/section-144-in-mathura-over-krishna-shahi-idgah-row/articleshow/87955929.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The police swung into action only after the villagers alleged that the two died due to consumption of spurious liquor. However, according to police, the family members of the victims told them that the two died in a road accident involving their motorcycle. Surprisingly, the police neither visited the accident spot nor seized the damaged bike for investigation. According to police, the person who died on Thursday was identified as Nawal Singh (45). “The other victim was identified as Devanand Sahni (35). He died while being taken to a hospital in Hajipur from Mahua on Friday,” police said. According to a senior police officer, Nawal’s body had been cremated by his family members before the matter came to the notice of the cops. An autopsy was conducted on Devanand’s body on Friday and the viscera was preserved for further analysis. Mahua SDPO Poonam Kesri said they had come to know from villagers that the two victims used to consume liquor. “However, family members said both died in a road accident. We are probing the case from all angles,” she said. The SDPO said according to the family members, Nawal died at the spot while Devanand was brought home and succumbed to his injury on way to the hospital. SHO of Mahua police station Krishnanand Jha said police have no idea about the accident spot and the damaged bike. “Viscera of Devanand’s body has been preserved for further investigation,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mystery-shrouds-death-of-two-vaishali-villagers/articleshow/87953550.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Recently, another 21-year-old girl, Anushka, was elected mukhiya of Kushahar panchayat in Sheohar district. A political science student of Sabour College, Ayesha has been active in social work ever since she married an engineer, Taj Hussain, in 2017. Earlier, her mother in-law, Asarfoon, had unsuccessfully contested the panchayat polls in 2016. According to sources, Ayesha defeated her nearest rival, Anuradha, by 327 votes. The latter had been holding the post of mukhiya of Fatehpur panchayat for the last three consecutive terms. Listing her priorities, Ayesha said, “Our panchayat’s literacy rate is quite low. I will, therefore, encourage people to send their kids to school. I will also focus on issues like sanitation, availability of drinking water and road connectivity.” The 21-year-old also thanked the people for reposing a lot of hope in her. After the results were announced, Taj told this reporter that he would encourage his wife to fulfil all the promises she had made to the people of the panchayat. On the other hand, Anita Kumari defeated her nearest rival and sitting mukhiya, Usha Gupta, by 3,434 votes in Chanderi panchayat under Sabour block in Bhagalpur district. Her victory margin is the highest in the district. In Jamui one Sohan Murmu was declared winner on the post of panch in Harkhar panchayat under Khaira block after his death. He passed away on November 6 due to illness. He won the election by defeating his nearest rival, Moora Hembrum, by 22 votes. The BDO-cum-block election officer, Raghvendra Tripathi, said, “The death of the candidate was not confirmed. Hence, the election was held in the panchayat in the eight phase on November 24 and the results were announced on Friday.” In Siwan one Chandan Kumar Pathak defeated the sitting mukhiya of Kushahara panchayat, Ashok Yadav, by 494 votes. Ashok is the son of RJD MLA from Raghunathpur, Harishankar Yadav. The family had been holding the post of mukhiya since 1979. Locals pointed out that Harishankar was elected as an MLA from Raghunathpur in the 2015 state assembly election while serving as a mukhiya. “In 2016 his son was elected on the post of mukhiya. But the family’s tradition took a beating in this panchayat election,” said a local, Ramesh Kumar. A cursory view of the results of the panchayat polls reveal that nearly 70-80% of the new faces are the favourite of the people to run the “gaon ki sarkar”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/another-21-yr-old-becomes-youngest-mukhiya-in-bihar/articleshow/87953461.cms||Ramashankar

The power units which were dedicated to the nation are Stage-II 500MW (2X250 MW) of NTPC Barauni Thermal Power Station (BTPS) and Unit No. 1 (660MW) of NTPC Barh Super Thermal Power Station (BSTPS). The CM also inspected different ongoing projects on the premises of the BSTPS. Before taking over as the CM in November 2005, Nitish used to represent Barh constituency in the Lok Sabha. He was elected as the Lok Sabha member from Barh for five consecutive times since 1989. Addressing a function at Barh, the CM said one of the three proposed units of 660MW started generating power from November 12. “But it was formally inaugurated today. The second unit will be inaugurated next year and the third in 2023,” Nitish said. “Today, I found that the Unit No. 1 is generating 678MW of power in place of 660MW. It is a matter of happiness,” the CM said. Quoting the Union power minister’s speech, the CM said, “R K Singh has already spoken here that the NTPC would generate such a huge quantity of electricity in Bihar that the state government would not have to purchase it from any private company. Since the minister hails from Bihar, he will fulfil the requirements of the state. I thank the minister and PM Narendra Modi for their support.” JD(U) president and Munger MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh urged the Centre to provide electricity at one rate to all the states. Earlier, while addressing a function at NTPC’s Barauni plant, the CM said his government had taken the pledge in 2015 to carry electricity to every doorstep in the state. “With the commissioning of the two power units at Barauni and Barh by NTPC, the state can now not only meet its own requirement, but also supply power to neighbouring countries,” he said. Nitish said when he assumed charge as CM of the state in November 2005, the state had only 700MW power generation capacity. “Today, this capacity stands at more than 6,000MW,” he added. Reminding people of the contributions of the state’s first chief minister Sri Krishna Sinha, the CM said it was under his (Sinha’s) visionary leadership that the foundation stones for three power generation units of 15MW each were laid at Barauni in 1960. “Unfortunately, Sri Krishna Babu’s good works could not be carried forward by the successive state governments. It’s the meticulous planning and hard work by the NDA government since 2005 that the state is now is fully assured of uninterrupted power supply,” he said. Union minister R K Singh said the power sector in the country has undergone tremendous growth during the regime of NDA. Those present on the occasion included central government power secretary Alok Kumar, NTPC chief managing director Gurdeep Singh, other senior NTPC officials, Matihani MLA Raj Kumar Singh and Teghra MLA Ram Ratan Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-dedicates-to-country-ntpc-units-at-barh-barauni/articleshow/87953352.cms||---

According to sources, Omicron was first found in South Africa and has since been detected in Belgium, Israel, Botswana and Hong Kong. It reportedly has a large number of mutations and an increased reinfection risk. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, the nodal officer for Covid at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna, told this reporter on Saturday, “Although the new deadly variant has not entered our country yet, our fight against Covid-19 should continue as usual. We should follow the safety protocols religiously.” Dr Sanjeev also advised different hospitals and healthcare centres to make all the necessary arrangements “so that the lives of people are saved in case of any fresh outbreak of the infection”. Echoing similar views, Dr Satish Kumar of Nalanda Medical College and Hospital said people should be careful. He continued, “With the current decline in the rate of Covid cases in Bihar, people have become carefree. We have to continue our fight against the virus by wearing face masks and maintaining social distance.” Dr Satish claimed that if the new variant came to Bihar, “it will be rather impossible to control its manifestations”. Talking about the transmissibility of the new strain of coronavirus, paediatrician Dr Arun Shah pointed out that Omicron had already spread to different countries in a short span of time. He warned, “It may even escape vaccine immunity and hence we have to be cautious. If it infects the people of our state, it will exert enormous pressure on our health infrastructure.” Dr Shah also urged the government to impose a ban on international flights for the next two to three months. On the other hand, Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, who is the dean of the medicine faculty in Aryabhatta Knowledge University, requested the government to ramp up testing to contain the spread of Covid-19. He said, “The Omicron variant is an emerging new threat for humanity which should be tackled properly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/amid-omicron-threat-doctors-urge-bihar-govt-to-impose-ban-on-international-flights/articleshow/87953388.cms||B K Mishra

The IIM Ahmedabad (IIM-A) has started electives on happiness and emotional stability, health economics among others. The IIT Gandhinagar (IIT-Gn) has started a course teaching students how to learn, while at MICA, the students got an opportunity to delve deeper into OTT platform craze through three courses. “Young adults entering the work environment today are looking at work differently... Our new electives centering around analytics and data sciences, management of health and the future of work in new economic contexts are driven by new work context,” said Prof Pradyumana Khokle, dean (programmes) at IIM-A. “Our relatively recent PGP in Advanced Business Analytics offers specialised courses in analytics of marketing, people, finance, operations, strategy, public policy, etc. The students can pick their area of interest.” Some of the electives included Future of work and its markets, Employment relations in the new economy, Artificial intelligence and machine learning for business, HRM and technology, and AI and digital platforms among others. MICA started the Global Governance, Change and Transformation (GCT) course as a response to post-Covid world along with offering special courses on OTT platforms. Prof Varsha Jain, Co-chair of FPM at MICA, also highlighted that the flexibility of online learning helped them organize 16 global webinars with 2,000 participants from 20 countries. Prof Dilip Srinivas Sundaram, associate dean (undergraduate studies) at IIT-Gn, said that they collaborated with about 30 international faculties for various electives and modules since the start of the pandemic. “It’s one of the highest numbers for the past few years. Moreover, we also introduced several new courses for the students primarily in their foundation course to ensure their physical and mental well-being,” he said. “One of the popular courses was learning to learn new things which came handy for the pandemic-affected students.” Experts said that while upskilling and reskilling became buzzwords in the post-Pandemic job market, the premier institutes are also roping in experts from different disciplines to inculcate knowledge on use of technology, data analytics and soft skills including how to appear for a job interview!||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/iim-a-offers-elective-on-happiness-iit-gn-teaches-how-to-learn/articleshow/87954788.cms||Parth Shastri

Lalu was shifted to the medicine department ward of AIIMS-Delhi on Saturday after his health condition improved. On Friday, he was admitted to the emergency unit of the hospital’s medicine department with high fever, low blood pressure and extremely low sugar level. “He is better now. His BP and sugar levels are under control,” former RJD MLA Bhola Yadav, a close aide of Lalu, told TOI over the phone from Delhi. RJD’s state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said though Lalu’s health condition improved on Saturday, he was still under doctors’ supervision. Lalu is suffering from multiple ailments, including diabetes, kidney problem, cardiac issues and hypertension. While the doctors had earlier restricted his daily liquid intake to one litre, it was further reduced to 600ml later on. Apart from doctors at AIIMS-Delhi, he is also under the supervision of a doctor from Ganga Ram Hospital. Doctors at Singapore and London were also consulted for Lalu’s kidney transplant. However, final decision on transplant has not been taken yet as family members are hopeful that his condition would improve without transplant. Lalu’s younger son and leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav is also in Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rabri-reaches-delhi-to-be-with-ailing-lalu/articleshow/87953447.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Speaking on the occasion, Bharti said the students can avail the facility as authentic books on different subjects were available at the libraries. Earlier, the students had to visit urban localities to get study materials. The SP assured the students of providing more books depending on the demand and requirement of the students preparing for various competitive examinations. He donated over 250 books to the libraries. Bharti said more libraries would come up in the remote villages to encourage students to pursue higher studies and prepare for various competitive examinations. The SP hoped that the facility would cement ties between the police and the people. “It is an attempt to change the perception of the people about the police,” he added. Several police officers were present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/two-libraries-set-up-in-red-hit-rohtas-villages/articleshow/87953417.cms||Ramashankar
---||Patna||Bihar: ‘Check poaching, intensify patrolling to protect winged visitors’||PATNA: With a view to protecting migratory birds from poachers, the department of environment, forest and climate change (DEFCC) has asked the authorities concerned to intensify patrolling near water bodies like Kabar Lake in Begusarai, Sarotar Lake in East Champaran and Rajdhani Jalashay in Patna. The principal secretary of the DEFCC, Dipak Kumar Singh, told this newspaper on Saturday that all the district magistrates, superintendents of police and divisional forest officers (DFO) had been instructed to keep tabs on activities like illegal killing and trade of migratory birds during the winter season. “Water bodies like Kabar Lake in Begusarai, Sarotar Lake in East Champaran and Rajdhani Jalashay in Patna witness the arrival of migratory birds from different parts of Central Asia. Hence, it is our responsibility to protect them from bird hunters,” Dipak said, adding that poachers in the state would be booked under various sections of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. A poacher was arrested from Sarotar Lake in East Champaran with 155 skinned migratory birds on January 24. The lake is often referred to as a “paradise” of migratory birds. Talking about the Durgavati reservoir in Kaimur district, DFO Vikash Ahlawat said, “We have intensified patrolling and deployed a team near the reservoir to keep an eye on bird hunters. We have also created a separate unit which is stationed at the observation centre of the reservoir.” According to ornithologists, different species of migratory birds such as Eurasian coot, common teal, Asian openbill, tufted duck, wagtail, northern pintail, gadwall, wood-warbler, European pied flycatcher and woolly-necked stork visit the state every year. Naveen Kumar, a member of the Bombay Natural History Society (pan-India wildlife research organization), claimed that quite a few poaching cases were registered at Kusheshwar Asthan in Darbhanga. “A portion of the bird sanctuary lies in Saharsa’s Jalai Chaur where there is no road connectivity. Poachers consider it a peaceful hunting ground with no interruption from the authorities concerned. They capture, kill and sell the migratory birds across the state at exorbitant rates,” he added. Asked about the ways to stop poaching, Naveen replied, “We need to raise awareness about the importance of migratory birds, create alternative sources of income for the poachers and take strict action against the culprits.” Various species of ducks (22), raptors (15), waders (8) and small birds (10) visit Bihar during the winter season from 30 different countries of Central Asia. Rajdhani Jalashay in Patna alone witnesses the arrival of several migratory birds like Eurasian coot, gadwall, garganey and greenish warbler.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/check-poaching-intensify-patrolling-to-protect-winged-visitors/articleshow/87953479.cms||Faryal Rumi

Over 41 stalls were set up during the 10-day-long fair which was kicked off from November 17. Union minister of minority affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi handed over the award to the resident commissioner of Bihar-New Delhi Palka Sahni and Upendra Maharathi Shilp Anusandhan Sansthan (UMSAS)-Patna director Ashok Sinha. “IITF concludes with the Bihar pavilion winning 6th gold medal for its outstanding implementation of ‘Aatmnirbhar Bharat’ campaign. It showcased the live demo of prominent handicrafts like ‘madhubani’, ‘manjusha’, ‘terracota’ and ‘sikki’ (sic).” Sahni tweeted. UMSAS was appointed as an implementing agency for decorating the pavilion at the fair organised by the India Trade Promotion Organization (ITPO). Elated with the award, state industries minister Syed Shahnawaz Hussain said that all-round development is taking place in the state under the leadership of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar. “It is a moment of pride that the handicraftsmen and weavers from the state are getting honoured,” he said, adding that the people in our country as well as in abroad like our products as they hold international standard in terms of beauty and quality. Meanwhile, folk artist Padmashree Dulari Devi gave live presentation of ‘madhubani’ paintings, while other folk artefacts and the products made by the traditional industries of the state were sold like hot cakes. The biggest feature of the pavilion were eco-friendly, handicraft and handloom products including bhagalpuri silk saris, suits, ‘matka’ silk saris, ‘bhagalpuri chadar’, appliqué work, jute handicrafts, ‘bawanbooti’, ‘madhubani’ paintings, ‘tikuli’, ‘manjusha’and ‘sikki’ arts.

This followed a Pocso court in Bihar’s Araria district completing its hearing and sentencing of a rape suspect in a single day on October 4, beating the previous record of a Datia district court in Madhya Pradesh that concluded in August 2018 a rape trial in three days. Manvendra Mishra, principal judge at Nalanda’s juvenile justice board, completed the trial after examining five witnesses, including the doctor who conducted the rape survivor’s physical examination and the investigating officer. The girl’s statement was recorded. The judge took circumstantial evidence such as bloodstained clothes, FIR copy, and forensic report of the bloodstains into account while pronouncing the judgment. Though this was his only offence, he has showed an “ability to commit crime and he cannot be released in the best interest of society”, said judge Mishra as he sentenced the teenager to two three-year terms, both running concurrently. He asked authorities of the remand home to ensure periodical psychological counselling for the juvenile and deduction of time spent in custody from the quantum of punishment. The teenager was accused of rape and taken into custody following a complaint from the girl’s mother. Additional public prosecutor Rajesh Pathak said the boy was arrested the day the crime was committed and charges under IPC and the Pocso law were framed against him on November 25.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nalanda-juvenile-court-completes-trial-conviction-in-1-day/articleshow/87953372.cms||Farrukh Nadim

Not a single organ from any brain-dead person has been donated in the past two years in the state. In fact, organs of only two brain-dead people have so far been donated in the state – first one in 2018 and another in 2019. Health experts have blamed lack of awareness, myth and lack of coordination between government officials, hospitals and social organisations for no organ donation from brain-dead people. IGIMS superintendent and State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (SOTTO) chairman Dr Manish Mandal said people should know the process of pledging organs to push this process. He said while organs are donated by nearly 80% of brain-dead people in southern states, the figure for northern states is around 20%. “Absence of awareness is one of the prime reasons for lack of organ donation from brain-dead people in Bihar. In two years, four bodies were donated to us. Had we been informed earlier, we could have used these bodies for organ donation ,” said Dr Mandal, adding, “We will visit schools, colleges and other places and tell students and people about the importance of organ donation.” Bihar SOTTO nodal officer Dr Manoj Kumar said those interested in organ donation could visit the Ward block of IGIMS or contact on 9473192773. “The process of pledging organs is very simple. One can fill form 7 online or offline,” he added. Transplant coordinator Jaspal Singh asked people interested in pledging organs to come to their office for counselling. SOTTO information, education and communication consultant Ekta Rani said though there is no chance of coming back to life in case of brain death, relatives still do not agree to donate organs thinking the person is in coma. She added several brain deaths happen in cases of road accidents and a proper coordination should be made with the traffic personnel, administration and those in the health sector to bring the bodies to the hospital immediately so that the organs could be saved and used. In order to create awareness in this regard, a walkathon was also organised by SOTTO on the occasion of National Organ Donation Day on Saturday. Health minister Mangal Pandey said an organ donation week would be observed this time in every district headquarters. IGIMS principal Dr Ranjit Guha stressed on the need to make organ donation a social norm. “If one person pledges to be a donor, he or she can save eight other lives,” said Dr Guha. Pawan Kumar Kejriwal of Dadhichi Dehdan Samiti said in case of sudden death in any family or if anyone wants to know about organ donation or body donation, the Samiti members can be contacted for a visit to the site.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/organs-of-just-two-brain-dead-people-donated-in-bihar-so-far/articleshow/87953493.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The governor’s assurance to this effect came when Chaudhary met him at Raj Bhavan and held detailed discussion on the recent happenings in the universities of Bihar. Chauhan returned from New Delhi on Friday evening after meeting Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan and other leaders following the recent developments. The governor reportedly pointed out that he had taken full cognizance of the letters received from the chief minister and the education department. He was also seized of the problems facing higher education in the state, he said. The chancellor further assured the minister that he would get all the allegations made against some vice-chancellors of the state thoroughly investigated soon. Later, the education minister told this newspaper that he was satisfied with the governor’s assurance on proper investigation into all the charges made against VCs and legal action against the persons responsible for the same. He said the government only wants fair and transparent governance in the universities. Much hues and cries were made in academic and political circles following the vigilance raid on the residence and office of Magadh University vice-chancellor Rajendra Prasad on charges of financial irregularities worth over Rs 30 crore on November 17. Later, the said VC was permitted to go on a month’s medical leave by the chancellor. Also, the CM wrote to the chancellor to investigate into the charges levelled by Maulana Mazharul Haq Arabic and Persian University vice-chancellor Md Quddus against L N Mithila University VC Surendra Prasad Singh who was recently awarded best vice-chancellor’s award by the governor.

SDB officials suspect that the wire holding the hoist at the multi-storey building under construction broke, leading to the crash. The deceased has been identified as Jivlal Chero, who suffered a neck injury leading to his death. Of the other two injured workers, Upendra is under treatment at a private hospital, while the other worker Satyendra was discharged after treatment later in the day. “The deceased suffered a neck injury that killed him. The other two do not have serious injuries and one has already been discharged,” said a police officer at Khatodara police station. “Chero died due to multiple injuries, while the other two workers are under treatment,” Mathur Savani, a core-committee member of SDB told TOI. He further said that it is yet not clear how the incident occurred. The three employees were working for a contracting firm, he added. Khatodara police registered a case of accidental death and started investigation. “The workers were doing some work on the outer surface of the building at about 30ft height when the platform crashed. Investigation will reveal exact details of how the accident occurred,” cops said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/platform-hoist-at-sdb-crashes-1-worker-dies/articleshow/87953902.cms||---

The bodies of the two victims — Jamna Gamit and her son Alok — from Moti Khorwan village of Tapi district, who were killed on Tuesday, were discovered in Khari village near Hathipura under the jurisdiction of Santhba police station in Bayad taluka of Aravalli district.

According to the police, the woman had left her husband Reshma Gamit and had started living with her lover along with her son. “We have recovered Rs 3 lakh and ornaments worth Rs 59,000 which the duo had looted from the slain victims. Initially, we were puzzled about the killers. However, the label on the blouse of the woman led us to the killers after we could tracing her to be from Moti Korwana village in Tapi,” said cops.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Progress of Kazhakootam elevated highway work hit by heavy rains||Thiruvananthapuram: The persisting bad weather has affected the pace of the ongoing works of the elevated highway at Kazhakootam such that completion of the works within the deadline announced may become a distant reality. Sources close to the project are maintaining that the rate of progression of the works have come down below 50% due to the rain. “Earlier, we have been moving forward at a rate of 6% per month. But for the past two months the rate of completion has come down to as low as 2%,” said a source. One of the major problems they are facing is the shortage of raw materials, mainly the aggregates (gravel and crushed stones). The shortage of aggregates was a result of suspension of operations of quarries in the wake of heavy rains. The adverse climatic conditions in other states such as Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh due to recent cyclone and rain situations have also impacted the availability of raw materials, which are sourced from other states as inter-state transportation was affected. Except for the aggregates, most other raw materials for the works are imported from other states. This includes cement sourced from Tamil Nadu, stressing materials sourced from Ranchi, steel from Bellary in Karnataka and admixture from Delhi. The persisting rain has also affected the construction of reinforced earth wall (RE Wall) of the elevated highway, especially on the Attinkuzhy end. It has been more than 45 days since they dug up earth for the construction of the wall. The panels for the wall have also been casted in the meantime. But the ground that constantly remains wet has made it an impossible task for installing these panels. These problems have even affected the working hours. “Earlier, we used to carry out the work round the clock. But now, we have stopped the works during night as it may be extremely dangerous for the labourers to work on wet surfaces under low light,” said a spokesperson of RDS Project Limited, the construction company that is carrying out the work for the National Highway Authority. The construction work of the elevated highway at Kazhakootam had faced many obstacles from the beginning, including from the delay in receiving letter of acceptance (LOA), failure of completion of land acquisition on time, lockdown induced by the Covid pandemic and labourers getting infected by the Corona virus. A month ago, PWD minister P A Mohammed Riyas had assessed the progress. He had also announced that the works will be completed by May next year. This is a key infrastructure project that is expected to solve the traffic woes in the IT corridor of Kazhakootam. Once completed, it will be the longest elevated highway in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/progress-of-kazhakootam-elevated-highway-work-hit-by-heavy-rains/articleshow/87954486.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Legislature session in Nagpur is for addressing people’s grievances, not just for making laws||The news of the winter session not being held in Nagpur for the second year in a row is certainly a disappointing one for Vidarbha. There is a big misconception that it is being conducted for enacting legislation. It’s true to a certain extent, but it is also held for discussing and addressing people’s issues. A big population resides in 11 districts of this region and citizens have their own set of problems. The winter session provides an ideal platform for them to apprise the government of their grievances through their elected public representatives. Can you think of our city without the Bombay high court’s bench? It has a major impact on almost all sectors in the region and has brought a sea change in lives of lakhs of citizens through public interest litigations. I would be happier if the session was not being held here, or if only laws are to be legislated. But if the legislature is to be understood as an instrument for the government to implement its various welfare programmes through law making, then its importance of coming to Nagpur increases. About 550 MLAs and MLCs arrive here. Although not everyone raises Vidarbha-specific issues, their mere presence is important, as they also come to know about problems faced by the citizens here. Any government functions through its bureaucracy and secretariat. Both look at Vidarbha only once in a year and people get a rare chance to apprise them of their grievances. Every year, hundreds of morchas from all over Vidarbha march to Vidhan Bhavan here when the session is underway. They are genuine people with genuine demands. All they want is that the bureaucracy and the government hear them out. They are satisfied if the minister concerned meets them and takes their representation of demands. The Gowari deaths took place as no top official or leader came to meet them. The protestors had wanted any minister to listen to their problems. It’s often said that the legislators come here for a picnic. I see nothing wrong in it as they also get to know about Vidarbha and its set of problems. Unless they see with their eyes, they can’t gauge the issues pertaining to the region like farmers’ suicide, malnutrition, irrigation backlog and others. Vidarbha has a plethora of problems and even the government admits to them. For example, the remote villages in Gadchiroli remain cut off from the rest of the world for four to five months during monsoon every year. Sadly, not a single MLA/MLC raises the question on why it happens and why the government is not coming up with a solution on this. If all-weather roads can be built in difficult areas like the Himalayas, why not in Gadchiroli? Even the healthcare requirements are taken care of by Amte and Bang families, instead of the government. Similarly, the government blames Melghat tribals for not eating nutritious food to avoid malnourishment, but who is responsible for them not getting quality food? All these issues of Vidarbha would never come to fore, if the session was not being held here. Those in the government must realise that we are a different set of people whose problems and requirements vary in comparison to western Maharashtra. Same yardstick can’t be implemented across the state. The government waived loans of small farmers having land less than five acres. But in Vidarbha, the minimum land holding is of 14-15 acres and thus they are deprived of such benefits. Therefore, any sitting of session is a must in Vidarbha, which should be conducted as per the Nagpur Pact to provide justice to the citizens here.

---||Patna||It’s good that Kirti Jha Azad has left party: Congress||PATNA: The Congress and RJD circles in Bihar appear to be watching the increased differences between the Congress and Trinamool Congress (TMC) from distance, but without being overly concerned about its eventual fallout and subsequent impact on Bihar. On Saturday, the TMC said it would have no floor coordination with the Congress during the winter session of Parliament from November 29. Incidentally, West Bengal CM and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee has thrown up concrete signals that her party has ambitions to make inroads into Bihar, as both former Rajya Sabha member and JD(U) functionary Pavan K Varma and former Lok Sabha MP from Darbhanga (Bihar) Kirti Jha Azad joined the TMC this week. “Azad was in the Congress, but he played no role in its affairs. Nor did he showed any involvement with the party’s activities in Bihar,” Bihar Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra said. “Azad was even made the party’s star campaigner for the recent by-election to the Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly seats, but he did not turn up. It is good for the state Congress that he has left the Congress,” Mishra added. At present, buoyed by the spectacular victory of the TMC over the BJP in the West Bengal assembly election this year, Banerjee has been trying to play active role in national politics in her bid to become the opposition’s choice to challenge the BJP. The TMC has taken to aggressively inducting Congress leaders and functionaries into its fold. Besides, Banerjee is also seeking to build the base for her party in the states where the Congress is either the lead party against the BJP, or in disarray, like in Goa and Tripura. By inducting Azad into the TMC, she has given an indication that her eyes are also set on Bihar, where the RJD and Congress have fallen out. However, RJD national chief Lalu Prasad has been refusing to accept the divergent stance of the Congress. Incidentally, during the West Bengal assembly election, RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, along with the party’s seniors had met Banerjee and extended his party’s support to the TMC. Also, the RJD did not contest the election there. “But the RJD is unlikely to show the same bonhomie in Bihar, because that way it will have to say goodbye to the three Left allies and even the Congress,” an observer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/its-good-that-kirti-jha-azad-has-left-party-congress/articleshow/87953861.cms||Abhay Singh

An offence has been registered against the owner of the cow. The incident took place in Rajivnagar in Navayard at the residence of Himanshu Solanki. His two-year-old son Devansh was attacked twice by the same cow outside his residence, Himanshu claimed. Himanshu said that Devansh was first attacked by the cow on Tuesday. “He suffered injuries on abdomen and private parts. There was some bleeding as well,” he added. Though, Himanshu could recognize the cow by its tag, he didn’t initiate any legal action. Himanshu said that his family too felt that the cow is an innocent animal. Himanshu, however, was left regretting the decision as Devansh was attacked again on Friday when he was playing outside his residence. This time too, the same cow was involved in the incident. The family recognized by cow by its tag number. Peeved at the repeated attacks on his son, Himanshu registered an offence at the Fatehgunj police station. He said that the police was trying to trace the owner of the cow and the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) cattle squad had also called him seeking details. The VMC has recently started a major drive to remove cattle from the roads of the city. It is also looking to rehabilitate cattle from the city at plots outside the city with facilities for their owners too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/two-year-old-attacked-by-the-same-cow-twice-in-four-days/articleshow/87953877.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Dr Amarnath is the first medical professional in the country to get a patent for a medical kit that has been indigenously readied. The PRP kit was designed keeping in mind financial constraints of patients who are unable to purchase imported kits. The PRP kit developed by Dr Amarnath helps get rid of joint pain and bypasses the need for some joint replacement surgeries. After successfully completing trial runs, Dr Amarnath sent the documents for securing patent rights for the kit almost a year ago. “We have secured the patent rights for the indigenously developed PRP kit. It is one of the biggest achievements in my career as it will be a game-changing product in providing the best affordable treatment,” he said. Speaking to the media here on Saturday, Dr Amarnath said the PRP kit will be available for less than Rs 3,000 whereas the cost of imported kits range between Rs 15,000-Rs 20,000. The PRP kit consistently gives platelet counts in excess of 10,00,000 per microlitre, which is a solution to joint pain, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/noted-orthopaedic-secures-patent-right-for-indigenous-prp-kit/articleshow/87954456.cms||Samdani MN
---||Kolkata||Kolkata police for blacklisting of vehicles with 200 cases||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Traffic Police is likely to submit a working mechanism to the transport department whereby any public transport vehicle with 200 pending cases is effectively “blacklisted”. Cops proposed that they identify those vehicles which use accident-prone stretches and prepare a list of the biggest defaulters on whom the transport department can then take stringent action. The cops said this was a working solution to its earlier proposal of withholding fitness certificates of buses till all pending traffic cases were cleared and an NOC was issued. Cops said these “drastic” steps have become necessary after a spate of accidents involving vehicles that have hundreds of pending cases. “Data analysis showed there were fine amounts close to Rs 16 crore and cases pending from 2016-17,” said an officer. The initial letter in this regard has been sent to the transport department, said sources. The police have stated that they expect the process to ease when e-challans get launched in the city, and eventually across the state. Cops will also ask bus owners to share plans by which they can get drivers to pay a part of the fines. DC (traffic) Arijit Sinha said, “We are planning a number of things to ensure no driver who is a repeat offender takes the wheels of a public vehicle.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/police-for-blacklisting-of-vehicles-with-200-cases/articleshow/87954485.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Denizens of the temple city, especially people of the 16 odd submersion-prone villages near Rayalacheruvu, heaved a sigh of relief after Chandragiri legislator Chevireddy Bhaskar Reddy on Saturday announced that all leakages have been plugged. He also asked people who vacated their villages and went away fearing submersion to return to their villages. The local MLA, who performed special rituals at the ancient water body after the repair work, warned mischief mongers not to spread false information regarding breaches to Rayalacheruvu, which caused fear and agony among the public. “It is unfortunate that random people are uploading videos with narratives that the project has breached and more than 100 villages will submerge, causing fear among people which is unfortunate. Now that the leakages are plugged, irrigation officials have been asked to closely monitor the inflows and outflows to the project and ensure that water does not go beyond its full storage capacity levels. I thank all engineers and experts who spent sleepless nights to plug the leakages to the project,” the Chandragiri legislator said.

In a bizarre incident, unidentified persons stole five crates of tomatoes from a vegetable market in Penuganchiprolu village in Krishna district. The incident happened on Thursday night and came to light on Friday after vendors noticed that five crates of tomatoes were missing. According to sources, stocks of tomatoes reach the vegetable market every night, a trend the miscreants noticed when they conducted a recce prior to the theft. Police sources said each tray of tomatoes is worth over Rs 2,000 and the total amount of stolen tomatoes is estimated to be around Rs 7,000. Local vendors explained that they realised the theft late on Friday. Penuganchiprolu police said they are aware of the incident, but no complaint has been lodged by the aggrieved party. Tomatoes are in high demand after a kilogram of the staple vegetable recently touched the Rs 130 mark in the market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/tomato-thieves-strike-krishna-village-make-away-with-5-crates/articleshow/87954420.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Tomato prices dip in AP after century mark||VIJAYAWADA: In a major relief to consumers, the cost of tomatoes dropped significantly in wholesale markets across the state on Saturday. The supply of tomatoes also increased when compared to the past week. Incessant rains in Chittoor and Anantapur districts had affected tomato yield. Crops on thousands of acres were damaged, leading to a shortage that pushed up prices across markets. Fine quality tomatoes were selling at Rs 110 per kilogram at Madanapalle market as recently as November 23 even as many traders across the state stopped selling tomato. Now, bringing some respite from the soaring prices, tomatoes from Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Telangana arrived at local markets on Saturday morning, bringing the price down to Rs 38 per kilogram at the Rajiv Gandhi wholesale market in Vijayawada. “Winter is a good harvest season for tomatoes. We sold tomatoes at Rs 12 per kilogram on the same day last year. But rains affected the local crop this year and the price of tomatoes shot up. Traders from neighbouring states are supplying tomatoes now. We are confident that we can import abundant stocks for the next two to three months,” said M Raghunath Reddy, a wholesale trader in Vijayawada. Consumers expressed happiness over the fall in price. “We missed purchasing tomatoes during the last ten days. It is a very essential vegetable and we had to buy it in small quantities at a higher price. Thanks to our traders who are importing stocks from other states. The government should take necessary measures to supply tomatoes at a cheaper price at rythu bazaars,” said M Rajya Lakshmi, a homemaker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/tomato-prices-dip-after-crossing-century-mark/articleshow/87954409.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Ahmedabad||Silence please! Akhbarnagar, Shivranjani noisiest spots in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: Incessant horn honking, revving engines, blaring loudspeakers, and wailing sirens, all have turned our city into a sonic battlefield. And the west side of the city is losing the war against noise pollution. A team of researchers analysed the noise levels at some of the busiest traffic junctions on Ashram Road and 132 Feet Ring Road to find that Akhbarnagar followed by Naranpura, Shivranjani, Keshavbaug and IIM-A are some of the noisiest spots on these traffic corridors. Most of the spots were along BRT junctions. The study was conducted by researchers from departments of civil engineering of Indus University, Ahmedabad, Gujarat power engineering and research institute (GPERI), Mehsana and PDEU, Gandhinagar. The noise pollution rules, 2000 limits daytime noise pollution level at 55dB for residential areas and 65dB for commercial areas. Yet, Akhbarnagar junction was found to be the noisiest at 86dB, then Naranpura (84.9dB). Shivranjani, Keshavbaug, and IIM-A also had relatively high noise pollution. The average noise level was 74.9 dB which peaked at 82dB at Shivranajani. The average at Keshavbaug was 76.8dB and the highest was registered at 85dB. At IIMA, noise levels rose 81.6dB while the average was 76.5dB. Similarly, on Ashram Road, Usmanpura, Income-Tax and Vasna junctions were the noisiest with peaks reaching 81dB, while average noise levels hovered between 73dB and 75dB. PDEU associate professor, Dr Anurag Kandya, points out, “We need to create a noise pollution map. Along with economic progress, the space to enjoy quiet, peaceful moments is crucial for citizens. What our cities need are soundscape designers.” The study was led by lead author Ketan Lakhtaria of Indus University and Sandip Trivedi of GPERI. Lakhtaria said, “The minimum noise level was above the permissible level of 55dB in almost 79.6% of the 22.5km corridors. This is worrisome.” The study claims stagnancy of the road network and traffic management issues is causing noise pollution. Ahmedabad had 49 lakh vehicles till last March. While this grows by 5-6% every year, the per vehicle road length availability, which should have been 2m, is currently 0.54m and dwindling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/silence-please-akhbarnagar-shivranjani-noisiest-spots-in-abad/articleshow/87954675.cms||Paul John

The recently-launched drive includes the destruction of ganja plants, curbing smuggling and awareness programmes. “Using over 30 machine cutters and other equipment, cannabis plants on 5,500 acres, including in some remote areas in Vizag Agency, were destroyed during the operation. Locals voluntary destroyed ganja plants in over 360 acres in Vizag Agency. We suspect the area under ganja cultivation is spread over 12,000 acres in the region,” joint director of SEB, Vizag, S Satish Kumar said. Satish said at a few places in some mandals in the Agency, ganja cultivators opposed the destruction of the crop. “However, our teams destroyed the crop after educating them on the consequences of the illegal trade,” he added. The SEB has seized over 23,000 kilos of dry ganja in Vizag Rural and Urban in the past four months. Over 10 teams, each comprising 60 to 80 officers, are engaged in Operation Parivartan. “We are focusing on the rehabilitation of cultivators by providing them with means of alternative livelihood in consultation with the Integrated Tribal Development Agency-Paderu and the horticulture and agriculture departments,” Satish added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/seb-excise-personnel-destroy-ganja-crop-on-over-5500-acres/articleshow/87954454.cms||Nalla.Babu

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: 30 babus draw Rs 1.57 crore rent from homes on govt-allotted plots||AHMEDABAD: The erstwhile policy of Gujarat government to allot plots to its employees in the state capital for a token amount has turned some of the Gujarat cadre IAS and IPS officers into landlords who are drawing huge rentals every month. As many as 30 such officials, belonging to 1986 to 1995 batches, are collectively drawing Rs 1.57 crore per annum in rents. The rental amount that these babus draw ranges from Rs 8,333 to as much as Rs 1.58 lakh per month! Over a decade, the rental amount any of these landlord babus draw has increased by a staggering average of 90%! Between 1988 and 2002, the state government allotted land at a heavily discounted rate to its employees in Gandhinagar and other cities. The government allotted land for the first time in 1988-89, then again in 1990-91 and for the last time the state allotted land to its employees in 2001-02. The government sold land to government employees at Rs 100 per metre in 1990-1991, which increased to Rs 400 per metre in 2001-02. Thereafter, the government stopped giving residential plots at token rates to its employees. The last time it did so was when it allotted land in Ahmedabad to Gujarat high court and lower court judges. The Immovable Property Return (IPR) filed by IAS and IPS officials for the year 2020, which is available in the public domain, reveal that as many as 25 IAS officers belonging to 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1995 have bought land from the government at token rates and built houses on it. Barring only five, the remaining 20 IAS officials have rented these houses and are drawing rents from it. Two IAS officers belonging to 1991 and 1995 batches draw Rs 8,333 per month each which is the lowest income generated from rentals among all 30 IAS and IPS officers. The highest per month rental, Rs 1,58,333, is drawn by one of the 1988-batch IAS officers. The second highest rental is drawn by an IAS officer of 1986 batch who is earning Rs 1,00,00 per month from his house. A 1991-batch officer and one IPS officer from 1985 batch earn Rs 62,500 per month each from rentals from houses built on government allotted land. The 20 IAS officers who have rented their houses built on government allotted plots in Gandhinagar collectively draw a rental amounting to Rs 1.12 crore per annum while ten IPS officers collectively draw rentals amounting to Rs 45 lakh per annum. Interestingly, a comparison of IPR records between 2010 and 2020 also reveal a staggering rise in the rental amount. The official who was getting Rs 50,000 as rental is now earning a monthly rental of Rs 1,58,333 per month from the same property, a rise of 216%! Another official who was earning Rs 18,500 per month in 2010 is now drawing Rs 49,500 per month which is a rise of 167% in a decade. The growth in their rentals range from 39% to 216% while an average growth in rentals stands at 90% in a decade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/30-babus-draw-rs-1-57cr-rent-from-homes-on-govt-allotted-plots/articleshow/87954737.cms||---

Thanks to the growing trend of hip-hop jewellery in a few countries, Diamond City’s fast developing jewellery manufacturing industry too is sparkling these days. After dominating the world in diamond manufacturing, the city is now eyeing on becoming a jewellery manufacturing hub and hip-hop jewellery is only adding to its bling. A city-based manufacturer recently made an umbrella pendant comprising 450gram gold and studded with 12,000 diamonds of 175 carats costing at least Rs 20 lakh. With a heavyweight like that, the pendant can be worn only with a heavyset necklace, and hence, the uber ensemble of pendant and necklace set now fetches a whopping Rs 50 lakh plus. Earlier, hip-hop jewellery was made in countries like the US and the UK where buyers were locally available. But thanks to growing demands, it has now reached down to local units in the Diamond City too. “Surat is now manufacturing hip-hop jewellery and the manufacturers are receiving orders from abroad. Earlier, Surat would only export polished diamonds for this type of jewellery but now we are making such jewellery here,” said Jayanti Savaliya, president of Surat Jewellery Manufacturers Association. Vijay Mangukiya, a manufacturer, is to display the umbrella and necklace set at the Gems & Jewellery Manufacturers’ Show-2021 to be held at SIECC, Sarsana starting from Saturday. “Hip-hop jewellery is a trend in a few countries and its manufacture requires expertise. Our manufacturers have developed the ability and they are making international standard jewellery,” said Kalpesh Vaghasiya, a jewellery manufacturer. At the show, 105 businesses will display their products of jewellery and machinery. Over 8,000 visitors from across the country are expected to visit the three-day show.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/hip-hop-jewellery-adds-bling-to-mfg-units/articleshow/87954769.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

It was our own government in free India. The Indian government at the time could…I won’t go into the reasons but the question also arises in the minds of the younger generation over the delay. This is definitely an issue for debate.” Sawant made these remarks while speaking at the inaugural ceremony of Rashtriya Vichar Manthan, a two-day event organised by Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Research Foundation, New Delhi, to commemorate 75 years of Goa Revolution Day. He suggested that the issue also be discussed in the forum. Governor P S Sreedharan Pillai, speaking on the occasion, referring to Sawant’s statement, suggested a “search and discussion” at the academic level on the issue. Sawant had made similar remarks two years ago which had sparked a controversy. Speaking at the ‘Know Your Army’ programme’ in January 2020, Sawant had blamed Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru for the delay in liberating Goa, thereby inviting criticism from certain quarters. He said that worldwide opinion against continuation of Portuguese rule in Goa, particularly following the 1955 satyagraha that led to the martyrdom of 22 freedom fighters from across Goa, built pressure on the Indian government to liberate Goa, culminating in the Indian military action against the Portuguese in December 1961. He further spoke about the various initiatives of the state government to commemorate 60 years of Goa’s liberation – preparation of a history book of Goa dating back to pre-Portuguese times, establishment of a Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj chair in Manohar Parrikar School of Law at Goa University, and organisation of 60 lecture series on Goa’s history at locations across the state. Several freedom fighters were felicitated by governor P S Sreedharan Pillai, Sawant and leader of opposition Digambar Kamat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-calls-for-debate-over-indian-govts-delay-in-securing-liberation/articleshow/87955036.cms||---

The operator has to offer sightseeing, food, local transport, hotels at stopover places, onboard entertainment and other such things. The arrangement can be for two to 10 years, said Arora. Operators have to give a security deposit of Rs 1 crore per rake. The size of each train would be 14-20 coaches, including two guard vans. ER has earmarked 3,033 ICF coaches for this.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tour-operators-can-take-trains-on-lease/articleshow/87954506.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The woman, a former registered medical practitioner at the TB ward, was also gagged with a cello tape. Police are still unsure about the motive behind the murder. Devakibai’s bed-ridden husband Jeevandas was in the room adjacent to the dining space in which the senior citizen’s body was found. The matter came to the fore when a relative walked into the room and raised an alarm. Police said Devakabai’s daughter and son-in-law live on the first floor. Her son had gone to the gym. The senior citizens were likely to be alone when the murder took place. Police said Devakabai was a pensioner and so is her husband. It’s not clear whether there was any robbery inside the house for which the murder was committed. Family members claimed that Devakabai used to allow vendors and hawkers to step inside the room for chats. Police are unsure whether such information was relayed to mislead the investigation. The top brass of the city police, including CP Amitesh Kumar, reached Nandanvan police station following the sensitive murder. Cops were surprised on learning that neighbours heard no strange noise nor witnessed any suspicious movement at the residence of the senior citizen. Sources in the locality said the family’s interaction with neighbours was bare minimum. Police have started rounding up suspects and known criminals from adjoining localities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/78-yr-old-woman-found-dead-with-throat-slit-hands-tied/articleshow/87954996.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||Picnic of sorts for powers that be, inconvenience for man on street||When the 1960 ‘accession’ of Nagpur into Maharashtra was completed, it was done with all kinds of lollipops, one of which was being designated as the ‘second capital’ of the state and the promise of a regular winter session of the state legislature for 6 weeks every year. Over the years, this has been reduced to a joke as the session is wound up within two weeks. In fact, in 2019 it lasted only for a week. Hundreds of crores of rupees are spent to move the entire state machinery here with its babudom, buses, jeeps and trunks & trunks of files and what have you! Tonnes of money is also spent on sprucing up parts of the city where these VVIPs may happen to cast their glance. For what? A picnic of sorts for the powers that be. Records will prove how the business conducted during the Nagpur session has been reducing over the years and may finally have come down to zilch. As if the humongous wastage of citizens’ tax money isn’t enough the man on the street is hugely inconvenienced by the road closures, bandhs, morchas and what have you. The city becomes almost unlivable for those staying in central Nagpur. Is it any surprise then that citizens curse this annual jamboree and want it stopped totally, little realising that it will mean another stone in the graveyard of Nagpur’s importance. I don’t blame the poor citizenry of Nagpur. Who would want to be stuck for hours behind rows and rows of smoke-puking buses and jeeps that invade the city during these times for the right of passage of the cavalcade of white SUVs with men in white in them. Shouldn’t anyone be accountable for this mess and broken pact? Shouldn’t we have the full quota of a six-week winter session with proper business being conducted of which the focus here mainly is Vidarbha? But to expect those from other regions to give this to us on a platter is living in a fool’s paradise. When leaders from our own region haven’t had our interests at heart and are satisfied by the leftovers thrown at them by those from western Maharashtra, why blame the latter? It’s time that we the people get serious about our rights. Unless there are huge protests and our vote is made our weapon, don’t expect things to change.

With school transport still stalled, parents are facing additional pressure. Meanwhile, representatives of the Chandigarh School Bus Association met the home-cum-transport secretary and sought a relief package from the administration. They wanted tax rebates but have not been offered any relief yet, which has triggered protests among school bus operators. Association president Manjit Singh Saini, general secretary Jeevan Ratan Sharma, vice-president Tarlochan Singh, adviser Manmohan Singh and treasurer Lakhbir Singh called on home secretary Nitin Yadav. They said school buses did not run for 20 months due to the Covid pandemic and now, the owners would have to spend around Rs 75,000 to start a bus. They said that since their income had been disrupted due to closure of the school, they should be given a relief package. Bus owners demanded that road tax not be levied from December 20 to March 22, extension in the term of school buses from 15 years to 20 years and no penalties. General secretary Jeevan Ratan Sharma questioned the administration on whether it was justifiable to levy tax on parked buses. Manjit Singh Saini said that since authorities did not agree to provide relief package during the meeting, bus operators are disappointed. The Union ministry of roads and transport has ordered all states not to harass school buses for non-completion of paperwork by October 31. Currently only a handful of schools in the city are running buses. Parents face difficulties Delay in resumption of school buses has left parents worried. Working parents are the worst affected. While they manage to drop children to school in the morning, it is difficult for them to pick the children up from school in the afternoon. Parents have also written to school principals asking them to start buses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/school-bus-operators-disappointed-over-lack-of-relief/articleshow/87954504.cms||---

They have been working for the past four months. They had issues with understanding the vehicle service-related work initially. However Ayub, who has been in this field for several years, took time to teach them the basics. He told TOI: “I could not tell them in words as to how to service the vehicles. Eventually, I understood their language, and taught them with hands-on approach.”In about a month, the trio honed skills in foaming, water spraying, vacuuming and even getting customers. They responded with a smile after coming to know that their work is being reported.Ayub, who is into social service, keeps helping specially abled people. But one day, he was in a catch-22 situation when someone asked him if he could find a job for the specially abled. “I made several attempts to find work for such people. But many employers said they cannot take risk by hiring them,” he said, adding that their rejection set him to think and act too.After deciding to hire such individuals to work at his water wash service station, he got in touch with Ramesh, Maruti and Rahul, who were also searching for a work. Ayub hired them and also trained them for some months. Sooraj, a customer, said he was thrilled to see them working. “They are focused in what they do. The trio competes among themselves to perform,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/this-automobile-service-station-is-indeed-special/articleshow/87953882.cms||Shreyas HS

Teams consisting of health inspectors, environmental engineers, and others have been formed by zonal offices. These teams are making their rounds in crowded market areas, bus terminals, and railway stations, inspecting each shop, visiting marriage halls, and other congested areas to check on people’s Covid-appropriate behaviour, said Suresh Itnal, HDMC commissioner.“The teams are imposing fines on people in markets, marriage halls, and other locations for failing to follow Covid guidelines. We’ve been making announcements and raising awareness about the rule for a few days, but many people are ignoring it now that the number of cases has dropped. However, we have now stepped up our efforts and begun to penalise people. We are imposing a Rs 250 fine for failing to wear a mask and a Rs 200 fine for failing to maintain social distance. We have collected fine of Rs 70300 on Saturday, ,” he said.The Karnatak Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) has also tightened its security measures, allowing only those who have at least received the first jab to enter the hospital grounds.KIMS director Dr Ramalingappa said, “Following an increase in the number of Covid cases on the SDM campus, we have decided not to allow people to congregate on hospital grounds, and to allow patients and their attendants to enter the hospital only if they have been vaccinated. If it is found that people have not been vaccinated, we have made arrangements to vaccinate them,” he said.Only 88% of people have received the first dose, and 49% have got the second. We are still falling short of the government’s target in terms of the second dose. People should work with us to stop the spread of the virus, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/hdmc-intensifies-drive-to-ensure-people-wear-masks/articleshow/87953880.cms||Basavaraj Kattimani
---||Delhi||Resident doctors stay off OPD services over NEET counselling delay||New Delhi: Patients services at RML, Safdarjung and Lady Hardinge hospitals were affected as resident doctors of the three Centre-run hospitals on Saturday suspended OPD services in protest against repeated delay in conducting NEET-PG 2021 counselling. The move came in the wake of a nationwide call by Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association (FORDA) for suspension of out-patient department (OPD) services at hospitals, from November 27. “Due to the pandemic, admission to various courses in NEET-PG 2021 has been delayed indefinitely. The residents have been carrying both Covid and non-Covid services tirelessly for the last one-and-a-half years and exhausted both physically and mentally. They have been waiting patiently till date for some positive outcome of the Supreme Court proceedings in the matter of already delayed NEET-PG 2021 counselling. However, there seems to be no respite to their distress, with the next court hearing scheduled on January 6,” the RML RDA said in a letter to the hospital administration. “To mark our protest against these repeated delays and postponement in counseling, we the residents of ABVIMS and Dr RML hospital decide to withdraw OPD services on November 27, onwards, including Sunday OPDs,” it said. The doctors’ associations demanded the government and the top court take necessary measures to expedite the NEET-PG counselling and admission process, and to fast-track the court proceedings.

In Mumbai too, daily cases dropped to 210 cases. After three days of a surge in fatalities, the tally dropped to under 20 on Saturday. The caseload of the state rose to 66.33 lakh and deaths stood at 1,40,908. But an analysis of the cases showed that the number of new cases (1,710) in November 17-24 increased by 16% over the previous week (1,472). In neighbouring Thane as well, the weekly cases went up from 729 to 959 in that period. Fresh detections in the state rose from 5,929 to 6,452 in the same period. BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said the rise was not significant. “The cases did not increase more than 50 per day. This could be due to changes in number of tests done on that date,” he said. Moreover, the daily positivity rate in the city has been consistently under 1% for months now. The BMC update on Saturday showed that 35,692 tests were done, leading to a positivity rate of 0.58%. “As long as the positivity rate is low and cases are between 200 and 300, there is no reason to worry,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/in-mumbai-daily-cases-of-covid-19-drop-to-210/articleshow/87955011.cms||---
---||Hubballi||Karnataka: Reproached by father, teenager ends life in Haveri; elder sister follows suit||HAVERI: In a tragic incident, brother and sister ended their life in Byadagi town, Haveri district on Friday. While the 16-year-old brother, the younger sibling, took the extreme step after his father allegedly reprimanded him, his 18-year-old sister, crestfallen over the loss, followed suit. Sources said that Nagaraj Chalavadi, a student of class ten, was reprimanded by his father, Chandru Chalavadi, who advised the former to attend his classes regularly, and study harder. Sources said that this drove Nagaraj to end his life, by hanging himself from the ceiling. His sister Bhagyalakshmi Chalavadi ended her life in the same manner, hanging from the same spot a few hours after her brother’s death. The Chalavadi family is distantly related to Haveri MLA Nehru Olekar. Byadagi circle police inspector Basavaraj said that Nagaraj grew agitated after he was upbraided by his father. “In the morning on Friday, when he was alone at home, he ended his life. His elder sister, Bhagyalakshmi, a PU student, who rushed to the taluk hospital on learning of Nagaraj’s death, was left completely shocked by his death. She went home when other members of the family were still at the hospital, and used the same sari to hang herself in the same room,” said Basavaraj, adding that they handed over the bodies of the two siblings back to the family after completing the post-mortem. A distraught Chandru Chalavadi is still struggling to come to terms with the incident, as is his wife. “I merely advised him as a father would. I did not know he would take such a drastic step. My daughter loved him very much, and could not imagine being without him, and followed him in death. We have lost both our children, and are in shock,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/reproached-by-father-teenager-ends-life-elder-sister-follows-suit/articleshow/87953886.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli
---||Nagpur||Man booked for mowing down two 3-month-old puppies||NAGPUR: Two separate offences have been filed at different police stations against motorists who dashed canines on the street earlier this week. The actions included an offence against a man who mowed down two puppies on November 24 at Krishna Nagari in Narsala. In another incident, Wathoda police registered an offence on Friday against motorist Pradeep Landge and seized his car, which is still detained at the police station, after his speeding car crushed a canine’s leg at Vaishnodevi Nagar Chowk. In the first case, Vijay Jadhav allegedly drove his car negligently, killing two three-month-old puppies in Narsala. The cops were initially reluctant to register the offence. The dead puppies were buried by the residents as cops did not come forward to conduct panchnama or postmortems. Animal activists Ankit Khalode, Rajesh Doshi and Swapnil Bodhane exhumed the dead puppies and ensured the postmortems were conducted. They pressured the cops to launch an FIR and threatened to stage a protest at Samvidhan Chowk. The activists were also planning to meet police chief Amitesh Kumar when the FIR was registered. “The cops, especially a senior officer, were saying the death of the puppies is a matter of NMC and not police,” said Bodhane, who had played key role in getting the offence registered. After much deliberation and preliminary inquiries, Hudkeshwar police registered the offence against Jadhav. “We summoned the accused and recorded his statement,” said senior inspector Sarthak Nehete from Hudkeshwar police station. In the other case registered at Wathoda police station, activists sent the canine for treatment. In both the cases, police have invoked Section 279 of Indian Penal Code for rash driving and the Prevention of Cruelty To Animals Act, 1960.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/man-booked-for-mowing-down-two-3-month-old-puppies/articleshow/87955022.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt wants Centre to halt flights from Africa; CM meet on new Covid-19 variant today||MUMBAI: In the light of the new Omicron variant isolated in southern African countries, the Maharashtra government will suggest to the Centre that flights from these countries be suspended. The state task force has advised a 14-day quarantine for travellers arriving from these countries and also those who recently arrived from the Omicron-detected countries should be contacted and sent to a 14-day quarantine. Meanwhile, the state task force held an emergency meeting on Saturday to discuss strategies to be adopted for the new variant of concern. The team’s suggestions have been forwarded to state additional chief secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will be hold a meeting on the issue on Sunday. The BMC on Saturday said all passengers arriving in Mumbai from southern African nations that are countries of concern will be screened thoroughly for symptoms of Covid-19 and their travel history will also be checked. If any symptoms are found, they will be tested. Officials said the BMC has asked the state and the Centre to allow it to send all passengers arriving from these African countries to 14 days of institutional quarantine. BMC officials said they will track all passengers who arrived in the past 15 days from African countries for symptoms. Health minister Rajesh Tope said that there is no immediate cause of worry in the state as no new variant has been detected. “We have communicated the situation to the Centre and have also requested the Centre to ban flights coming from the affected countries,” said Tope. He said the suggestion was made by BMC commissioner I S Chahal and was forwarded to the chief secretary to take it up with the Centre. The state may want to check on people who travelled back from these 11 countries in the past 15 days. “We have to strengthen surveillance, both sentinel (monitoring rate of spread of certain diseases) and genomic sequencing,” said Dr Joshi. Tope said there is already a protocol to screen and test swabs of people coming in from certain countries which include African countries. “We are screening passengers coming in from some countries, but we will intensify the monitoring at the airports,” said Tope. “If an international traveler arrives in Mumbai from an African country where the new Covid virus has been found, their passport should be strictly checked. A medical examination should also be done on the basis of whether the passengers are showing signs of infection or not. If a traveller is found to be infected, he or she should be subjected to immediate institutional quarantine and their sample should be sent for genome sequencing,” Chahal said. “Travel history of the last fortnight from international travellers arriving in Mumbai will be collected. There are no direct flights to Mumbai from African countries infected with the new virus. All incoming international travellers are required to provide a self-declaration letter stating their travel information for the last fortnight. Their passports should be scrutinised by the airport authorities,” Chahal said. State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said it is early days yet as far as Omicron is concerned. “We know it has mutations, but are these extra weapons that help make the variant more transmissible or severe remains to be seen.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-wants-centre-to-halt-flights-from-africa-cm-meet-on-new-variant-today/articleshow/87955024.cms||---

Go First’s (formerly GoAir) Bengaluru-Patna G8-873 flight made an emergency landing at the Nagpur airport as one of its engines reportedly faced a snag. Sources in Mihan India Limited (MIL) said the air traffic control (ATC) was informed by the pilot that engine number 2 of the plane had caught fire. The fire was under control and the engine was shut down and an emergency landing was made at the airport here. A Go-First spokesperson, however, denied any fire being reported in the engine. There have been issues with the Pratt and Whitney engnines since its induction though this case has has been reported after a long time, said sources. MIL, the airport operator at Nagpur, had geared up to face a full scale emergency keeping ambulances and fire tenders ready to face any eventuality. The plane had 139 passengers apart from the crew. All the passengers are safe and were being shifted to another aircraft. Two passengers reportedly suffered minor injuries. A press release by Go First says the flight from Bengaluru to Patna was diverted to Nagpur after a faulty engine warning was received in the cockpit. The captain shut down the engine as a precautionary measure. Following the standard operating procedure, the plane was landed at the Nagpur airport. All the passengers were deplaned and served refreshments. An alternative aircraft was arranged at 5pm. There were two cases of minor injuries, said Dr Mohammed Ithesham of Kingsway Hospitals whose ambulance is deployed at the airport for emergency cases. “One over 50-year-old woman fell after she missed a step in the ladder connecting the aircraft. She sustained a facial injury and was rushed to the hospital. Even as the other parameters like blood pressure are stable, the opinion of a maxillofacial surgeon is awaited over the nature of the injury. Another woman passenger suffered a neck sprain and is being attended to,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bengaluru-patna-flight-makes-emergency-landing-after-snag/articleshow/87955026.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Covid-19 stalls children’s routine immunisation, says NFHS||CHANDIGARH: Routine immunisation of children was majorly impacted during the Covid pandemic. According to NFHS-5 data, the Tricity recorded drastic reduction in Polio, measles and overall vaccination of children between 12 and 23 months of age. In Mohali, the overall decrease was less than the national average while Panchkula and Chandigarh had immunisation either comparable or higher than the national average in some of the vaccination categories. In the Tricity, Panchkula fared the best with overall 92.6% vaccination, while Chandigarh and Mohali registered 82.8% and 78.6% vaccination. This information was gleaned from vaccination cards provided by beneficiaries. The country saw overall increase in immunisation of children as compared to the previous NFHS survey of 2015-16 but barring Chandigarh’s polio coverage, overall vaccination had declined during the pandemic survey. The three doses of DPT also reduced from 94.4% in NFHS 4 to 85% during the present survey in Mohali. Also, the three doses of hepatitis B slightly declined from 85.2% to 82.9%. In Panchkula, DPT showed reduction from 100% to 97.1% but an increase in three doses of hepatitis B from 95.6% to 97.1%. In Chandigarh, DPT doses declined from 95.9% to 87.9%, and increased in hepatitis B from 82.7% to 84.9%. “The focus was on Covid as the entire workforce was centred on the pandemic. It was claimed initially that no such services have been affected. But this survey clearly shows the fallout,” said a public health expert. He added, “These vaccines are given in hospitals and clinics, except polio which is door to door. As hospitals were closed for non-Covid services and there was lockdown, routine immunisation suffered. Those who missed doses have been coming later.” Eight Covid cases reported in Tricity Five Covid cases were reported in Chandigarh on Saturday while one patient was discharged. This took the number of active cases to 52. As of now, 65,443 Covid cases have been reported in the city while 64,571 have recovered. One fresh Covid case was reported in Mohali on Saturday, taking the number of active cases to 46. Officials said out of 68,939 Covid cases reported so far, 67,822 patients have been cured and discharged. Two Covid cases were reported in Panchkula on Saturday and active cases reached 36. Chief medical officer (CMO), Dr Mukta Kumar said out of 30,829 Covid cases reported so far, 30,414 patients had been cured and discharged from the civil hospital in Sector 6.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/covid-stalls-kids-routine-immunisation/articleshow/87954515.cms||Shimona Kanwar

The incident might have occurred between 6am and 2pm, police officials said. The Wakad police suspect that the robbers might have gathered information about the duty hours of security guards at the bus stop before carrying out their act. Police sub-inspector MK Maner said that they are gathering footage of CCTV cameras from the area. “There are two security guards for day and night duty at the bus stop. The guard, who was on night duty, told us that the doors did not get stolen at night. The security guard was not there for some hours on Friday. We suspect that the robber might have taken advantage of this gap and stolen the doors,” Maner added. “However, these doors cannot be taken by one person. So, we suspect the involvement of multiple people They must have parked a vehicle and loaded the doors on it. We could not locate any vehicle in the footage we have checked,” said Maner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/automatic-doors-of-pmpml-bus-stop-stolen/articleshow/87954517.cms||---

The “miracle” was brought on not by a surgery on her legs but on her stomach. His mother, Malan, underwent a bariatric or weight-loss surgery, in which surgeons at Jupiter Hospital, Thane, removed a part of her stomach to create a new banana-sized stomach or “sleeve”.  “I had swollen legs, could hardly breathe or sleep peacefully,’’ said Malan, who has since lost 17kg, and no longer needs a wheelchair.“She is possibly the oldest patient to undergo bariatric surgery in Thane city,’’ said bariatric surgeon Dr Prashant Salvi. The doctor and the Gaikwads say they believe the lockdown due to Covid aggravated Malan’s health issues. “Till the lockdown was announced, I would be active in my home in Satara, cooking, walking to the market place and taking care of our pets,’’ she said. However, once the lockdown was announced, she was unable to step out. In a few months, her weight increased by over 30kg. “I would cook and eat so that food doesn’t go to waste, and this led to weight gain over months,’’ she said. Her health parameters were severely affected. “It is her comorbidities that worsened due to the excess weight,’’ said Dr Salvi. Her blood sugar would be over 300 despite medication, her sleep apnea worsened and she was breathless even on standing for a bit. “In September, I had to get my mother from Satara to my home in Thane and she was hospitalised for a week due to her diabetes problems,’’ said Sunil. Her ankles and neck were swollen. Looking at her health chart, their family doctor recommended that they meet Dr Salvi for a consult on bariatric surgery. She was put on a liquid diet and asked to use a CPAP machine (which delivers a stream of oxygenated air into a patient’s airways through a mask and tube) to treat sleep apnea. On November 9, she underwent surgery and has been on a liquid diet. She could lose another 30 kg over the next few months. “She hasn’t needed any diabetes or blood pressure medication since the surgery,” added the doctor. Bariatric surgeon Dr Shashank Shah, who operates at Lilavati Hospital, Bandra, said people have stopped fearing weight-loss surgeries since Covid-19 began. “Due to Covid, people are very conscious about their blood sugar and breathlessness. They want these conditions to be brought under control and in people with certain BMI and health conditions, bariatric surgery works well,’’ said Dr Shah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-110kg-in-lockdown-woman-gets-bariatric-op/articleshow/87955045.cms||---

Water supply to some areas of Salt Lake was affected on Saturday afternoon as well since Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority went in for phased shutdown to clear the reservoir for repairs through the night. KMDA engineers fixed bellmouths at the water reservoir to increase its capacity and supply more water. The Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) will soon receive an additional two million gallons per day (MGD) of water from the New Town treatment plant and another two MGD from Tallah. Though the shutdown was announced from 9pm on Sunday, residents of some blocks, including BA, said supply was very poor since Saturday morning. The supply eased in the evening before being shut for the repairs. BMC officials warned water supply may be low across Salt Lake till Sunday afternoon as the pumping station will first have to fill the reservoir before resuming supply. Two new pumps were recently installed at the Central Park pumping station to increase its pumping capacity for BMC to supply more water across Salt Lake. BMC currently receives 11 MGD of filtered water, of which 7 MGD comes from Tallah and the rest from the New Town plant. Water is being supplied in BMC area in four instalments — early morning, mid-morning, late afternoon and late evening. “Sector V now receives around 2 MGD from Tallah. The plan is that once filtered water is supplied from New Town, Nabadiganta authorities will no longer have to take the 2 MGD for Sector V from Tallah,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/salt-lake-water-supply-likely-to-normalise-by-today-evening/articleshow/87954521.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Cultural minister Saji Cherian released the book authored by honorary Russian consul and Russian House director Ratheesh C Nair by handing over a copy of the book to former diplomat T P Sreenivasan. The diary of the Russian girl had caught the world’s attention. The notes spread in nine pages were full of death accounts of her dear and near ones who died one after another in the war. “Tanya Savicheyude Kadha” is the third book written by Ratheesh C Nair. “We have not learned lessons from the misery inflicted on mankind by the wars. World War II led to many geographical and political changes'', minister said. The siege of Leningrad alone killed one million people. “The nine-page diary notes are sufficient to reflect the lives of helpless children on the battlefield. It is our duty to save the next generation from war and terrorism,” said Saji Cherian. “The victory of the Soviet Union in World War II marked the beginning of the victory of the Allies. But Russia had to sacrifice the lives of about 2 crore 70 lakhs people for that. At that time, there was not a single family in Russia which had not lost at least one member to the war,” said T P Sreenivasan. An exhibition was also held which includes the pages from the diary. Janayugam editor Rajaji Mathew Thomas and Rose Mary also attended the programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/book-celebrates-a-diarist-who-wrote-about-ww-ii/articleshow/87954530.cms||---

The woman would collect crores while offering high returns on ‘investments’. Tella Shilpa Chowdary, and her husband Tella Krishna Prasad, were arrested and sent to judicial remand, the Narsingi police said on Saturday. Police said they have information the couple cheated victims of at least Rs 8 crore. On November 13, Narsingi police received a complaint from one Divya Reddy, who claimed that she knew Shilpa Chowdary for 10 years and they used to meet regularly at kitty parties organised by Shilpa and others. During one of these parties, Shilpa offered Divya an opportunity to invest in her real estate business and the complainant agreed to give Rs 1.05 crore. The victim was offered high returns for her investment. Even after one year, the accused did not return her investment. “One day when the complainant went to meet Shilpa at her residence to ask that the money be returned, the accused allegedly with the support of bouncers sent her away and threatened her,” deputy commissioner of police (Madhapur) M Venkateshwarlu said. According to him, Shilpa was involved in the production of a Telugu film, which is yet to hit the screen due to disputes. She took money from people linked to film industry, especially financiers and those in the real estate business, many were women whom she hosted parties for. Apart from Divya, police received two more complaints and few more are expected to come.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: High on property tax, but low on facilities||SECUNDERABAD: Property tax from Ward no-VI (New Bowenpally) is the highest among all wards falling under the Secunderabad Cantonment Board, with Rs 25 crore being collected per annum. While residents of the ward remain dutiful citizens, they lag behind in basic amenities. Even as seven SCB wards contribute Rs 5 to Rs10 crore worth property tax, ward-VI itself contributes the major chunk. “Over the past four decades the SCB has faced ‘cash crunch’. It lacks the machinery to use the tax to provide basic civic facilities to us. We want civilian areas of the Cantonment to be merged into the GHMC,” K Prashant, a resident of SBI Colony, said. Among the major drawbacks that residents face is the poor roads in the area. Of the 80km road network here, about 60km is not fit for commuting. “Nearly Rs 3 crore is needed to give the road network a facelift. We are trying to maintain the roads with available funds,” former SCB ward member, K Pandu Rangam Yadav, said. On the issue of revamping nalas — damaged due to 2020 floods — Yadav said, “widening of the nalas and demolition of encroachments has been taken up at a brisk pace. We have completed works at SAIL Colony, and in Dhanalakshmi Colony work is in progress.” There has been pent up anger in the area after over 50 to 60 residential colonies in the ward faced major devastation following 2020 flooding. Nearly Rs 3 crore worth of assets were damaged, said residents and officials. In spite of being tagged as the ‘richest ward’, people of the area have been begging for better treatment. They want SCB civil areas to be merged into the GHMC immediately. “The SCB engineering wing are not technically sound. The neighbouring GHMC has been drawing up plans to tackle heavy floods, but here, officials have been mute spectators,” said J Narayana, a resident of SAIL Colony, which was marooned in floods. Another resident B Sridhar, who sold his ancestral property in L B Nagar and bought a flat at Dhanalakshmi Colony here said he regreted his decision. “I realised that I made a great mistake after my flat got inundated due to severe flooding. My car swam like a swan in the dirty water and I spent Rs 50,000 on repairs. SCB officials did not pay attention on nala widening and removing of slit, and this led to inundation.” In spite of his tenure ending, Yadav continues to visit SCB main office and get sanctions for pending works. “The aim is to complete all pending works ahead of Cantonment Board elections notification in my ward,” Yadav said. “I assuring that long-standing Ramannakunta’s beautification work will be completed in a month,said Yadav, who took part in the visit of Defence and SCB officials to the area on Saturday. The biggest relief for the ward is there are no defence installations here and Local Military Authority’s interference is nearly nil, when compared with other SCB wards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/high-on-property-tax-but-low-on-facilities/articleshow/87954540.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||World||UK, Germany & Italy report cases as world scrambles to shut out variant||Britain on Saturday tightened measures with compulsory PCR tests for all international arrivals while more nations imposed restrictions on travel from southern Africa. The US state department advised against travel to eight southern African countries while Australia said it would ban non-citizens who have been in nine southern African countries and will require supervised 14-day quarantines for Australian citizens returning from there. Pakistan banned travel from 6 African countries and Hong Kong even as Bangladesh suspended flights from South Africa. Britain and Germany each detected two cases of the new Omicron coronavirus variant on Saturday while Italy reported one positive case. British PM Boris Johnson announced new steps to contain the virus, while more nations imposed restrictions on travel from southern Africa. The discovery of the variant has sparked global concern, a wave of travel bans or curbs and a sell-off on financial markets on Friday as investors worried that Omicron could stall a global recovery from the nearly two-year pandemic. The two linked cases of the new variant detected in Britain were connected to travel to southern Africa, British health minister Sajid Javid said. Speaking later, Johnson laid out measures that included stricter testing rules for people arriving in the country but that stopped short of curbs on social activity other than mask wearing in some settings. “We will require anyone who enters the UK to take a PCR test by the end of the second day after their arrival and to self-isolate until they have a negative result,” Johnson told a news conference. People who had come into contact with people testing positive for a suspected case of Omicron would have to self-isolate for 10 days and the government would tighten up the rules on wearing face coverings, Johnson said, adding the steps would be reviewed in three weeks. The health ministry in the German state of Bavaria also announced two confirmed cases of the variant. The two people entered Germany at Munich airport on November 24, before Germany designated South Africa as a virus-variant area, and were now isolating, said the ministry, indicating without stating explicitly that the people had travelled from South Africa. Italy’s National Health Institute (ISS) said a case of Omicron has been detected and the genome was sequenced at the Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology, Virology and Bioemergency Diagnostics of the Sacco Hospital in Milan from a positive sample of a patient coming from Mozambique. The patient and his family contacts were in good health, the ISS said. Czech health authorities also said they were examining a suspected case of the variant in a person who spent time in Namibia. England’s chief medical officer, Chris Witty, said at the same news conference as Johnson that there was still much uncertainty around Omicron, but “there is a reasonable chance that at least there will be some degree of vaccine escape with this variant”. Omicron, dubbed a “variant of concern” by the WHO, is potentially more contagious than previous variants of the disease, although experts do not know yet if it will cause more or less severe Covid-19 compared to other strains. The variant was first discovered in South Africa and had also since been detected in Belgium, Botswana, Israel and Hong Kong. Although epidemiologists say travel curbs may be too late to stop Omicron from circulating globally, many countries around the world — including the US, Brazil, Canada and EU nations — announced travel bans or restrictions on southern Africa on Friday. On Saturday, Australia said it would ban non-citizens who have been in nine southern African countries from entering and will require supervised 14-day quarantines for Australian citizens returning from there. Japan said it would extend its tightened border controls to three more African countries after imposing curbs on travel from South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Lesotho on Friday. Britain also said it was expanding its “red list” to put travel curbs on more southern Africa countries, while South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Oman and Hungary also announced travel restrictions on southern African nations. South Africa is worried that the curbs will hurt tourism and other sectors of its economy, the foreign ministry said on Saturday, adding the government is engaging with countries that have imposed travel bans to persuade them to reconsider.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/uk-germany-italy-report-cases-as-world-scrambles-to-shut-out-variant/articleshow/87955935.cms||---

The prices of cotton in local markets dropped by Rs 1,000-1,200 per candy (356kg) over the last two days as the new variant, currently circulating in South Africa, spooked the global cotton market, said traders. The prices of benchmark cotton variety, Shankar-6, have come down to Rs 65,300-65,800 per candy from their high levels of Rs 66,500-66,800 over past two days. “New variant of coronavirus has spooked the market, which has pulled down cotton prices in local markets,” said Arun Dalal, a city-based cotton broker. “Following price dip in international market, domestic futures prices also dipped. Consequently, spot prices too eased,” said a cotton trader from Rajkot. According to traders, arrivals of new crop to local mandis is currently slow and domestic mills are making limited purchases given the high price of the natural fibre. About 35,000 to 40,000 bales (one bale weighs 170kg) are arriving daily in local mandis . This should have been higher at 55,000 to 60,000 bales, added traders. “Presently, arrivals are slow as farmers are busy with marriage season and there is also a shortage of labourers to pluck cotton.The arrivals are expected to pickup after December 10,” said a city cotton trader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/concern-over-new-ncov-variant-hits-cotton-prices/articleshow/87954554.cms||---

DIG said the SI was found to be at fault for two reasons. First, there was a delay in registering the FIR as the complainant's relatives were sent away twice citing that the crime took place outside the limits of the Mangalapuram police station. The second was that the SI failed to initiate action on an existing arrest warrant against accused Faisal. The warrant was related to an attempt to murder case reported in the year 2018. The friends and relatives of the complainant had attacked Faisal in retaliation after he was let go on bail after the SI only invoked bailable charges against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/si-suspended-for-protecting-criminal/articleshow/87954556.cms||---

While last year around 43,000 candidates registered for the centralised admission process (CAP) after clearing the state’s entrance test, the numbers have crossed 55,000 this year. The numbers are the highest in the last three academic years. Experts claim that several students may have deferred their MBA education last year, adding to the overall numbers this year. The state’s CET cell received 68,282 applications this year during the registration process, of which over 55,000 candidates confirmed their applications. The choice-filling process is likely to start soon. Officials are expecting the increase in applications to translate into enrolment too. Last year, of the total 32,279 seats available under CAP, 33 per cent remained vacant after the admission process. Professor S Narayan Rao, head, Shailesh J Mehta School of Management, IIT-Bombay, said that a lot of students may have deferred their MBA education last year for different reasons. With things getting back to normal, many may want to return to complete their degree, he said. The numbers will have to be seen from the perspective of pre-pandemic years, he added. Lack of jobs in the market could also be pushing many graduates to complete their MBA, said another professor. Globally the volume of applications grew by 0.4 per cent, revealed the 2021 Application Trends Survey by Graduate Management Admission Council.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-applications-to-b-schools-in-state-at-a-3-year-high/articleshow/87955073.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Poor students deprived of education during Covid pandemic: Hry guv||JK Singh | TNN Ambala: Haryana governor Bandaru Dattatreya on Saturday said that students from poor and remote areas had been deprived of education during the Covid pandemic, which underscored the importance of technology in education. Dattatreya said that in the present day and age, moral education was equally important for children. He was speaking at the “School leadership summit - 2021” organised by National Independent Schools Alliance (NISA) at BPS Planetarium in Ambala Cantonment, where he was the chief guest. Dattatreya also released a report prepared by NISA, which shed light on online education, learning loss and other aspects related to education during the Covid pandemic. Addressing the gathering, Dattatreya appreciated the work done by NISA to make quality education available to students from poor backgrounds. “All sections have suffered in one way or the other during the Covid pandemic but students have suffered the heaviest loss of education. The pandemic made us realise the important of technology in education. Children from poor and far-flung areas were deprived of education during the Covid pandemic,” said Dattatreya. Highlighting the adverse effect of the pandemic on education, Dattatreya said, “A survey has found that only 40% of children have been able to take online education. In such a situation, we need to repeat the syllabus to compensate the education of children. For this, tutorial classes need to be started.” The Haryana governor expressed happiness over the emphasis on value-based education, skill, vocational education and development of children in the new National Education Policy (NEP), 2020. “A provision has been made in the NEP that children should be given skill education according to their interest from primary to higher education so that they grow up to become job givers rather than job seekers,” said Dattatreya. According to him, health and education were not for earning money.“These are two important pillars of human resource development, which can neither be compromised nor traded. Today is the era of competition. In such a situation, children studying in expensive English schools go ahead and rural children become victims of inferiority complex due to lack of English. In such a situation, special attention needs to be given to those children also. Along with English, children should also acquire knowledge of their mother tongue from their heart,” said Dattatreya. He said that the education which is received from the heart brings good values and the person contributes in the development of the country by becoming a good citizen. Others present on the occasion included NISA president Kulbhushan Sharma, Ambala DC Vikram Singh, Ambala superintendent of police (SP) Jashandeep Singh Randhawa, additional DC Sachin Gupta, Ambala Cantt SDM Nishu Singhal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/poor-students-deprived-of-education-during-covid-pandemic-hry-guv/articleshow/87954559.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Mere statement not enough to prove man was drug supplier, says court||MUMBAI: A special Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act court that granted bail to the alleged drug supplier of Aryan Khan and Arbaaz Merchant in the cruise liner drug seizure case has observed that barring his statement there is no prima facie evidence to show that he was the supplier of the contraband. “Therefore, contention of the prosecution cannot be accepted that applicant is peddler and that he supplied contraband to accused no 2 (Merchant),” special judge VV Patil said. Santacruz resident Shivraj Harijan (33) was arrested on October 9 on the basis of Merchant’s alleged statement and 62 grams of charas was allegedly recovered from him. While Harijan was granted bail on Monday, the detailed order copy was made available on Friday. The court also said that considering the material placed on record, it cannot be said that prima facie there is conspiracy and abetment, as alleged by the prosecution. Harijan’s bail plea argued by advocate Sandeep Sherkhane said that the panchanama was false and misleading and cannot be relied upon. He also submitted that the drugs allegedly seized were of a small quantity.  The Narcotics Control Bureau had alleged that Harijan’s name cropped up during interrogation of Merchant and from Harijan they recovered 62 grams of charas near Rajesh Khanna Garden in Santacruz (west). He’s the 16th accused to be granted bail in the case. The court, however, said, “In the case at hand, though prosecution claimed that applicant is peddler and he used to supply contraband to accused no 2, prosecution failed to bring on record any cogent evidence in that regard.” The court said that except statement of co-accused, there is no prima-facie evidence to show that Harijan committed offences, as alleged by the prosecution. “Further, as argued on behalf of the applicant, the alleged recovery of 62 gm of charas is non-commercial quantity and rigours of sec 37 would not apply,” the court said. Under section 37 of the NDPS Act, no person accused of certain sections or for offences involving commercial quantity can be given bail unless the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that he’s not guilty and that he is unlikely to commit an offence while out on bail. The court also said that since Khan, Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha were granted bail by the Bombay high court, Harijan can be also released on bail on the grounds of parity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mere-statement-not-enough-to-prove-man-was-drug-supplier/articleshow/87955085.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The tunnel project has been touted as a critical one to reduce traffic congestion at Gandhi Chowk on the Mussoorie Mall Road. Speaking to TOI, Mussoorie MLA Ganesh Joshi said, “This tunnel would resolve the traffic congestion issue in Mussoorie for the next 100 years.” The MLA added that the length of the tunnel has been increased from 2.74 km to 4.5 km and the entire cost of the project has been raised from Rs 700 crore to Rs 837 crore. However, environmentalists have been opposing the project since its inception, saying Mussoorie is a seismically-active zone and the tunnel could pose grave risks for the town. They fear that the tunnel would adversely impact underground aquifers, which are among the primary sources of water for the town. "We are in a seismically active zone and the construction of tunnel could pose a risk to the town,” said Hugh Gantzer, a member of the Supreme Court panel constituted to monitor the environmental issues of the Doon Valley and Mussoorie. Reenu Paul, a Dehradun-based environmentalist, added, “Just as the Char Dham road project has destroyed the Ganga valley, this tunnel would cause damage in the entire Yamuna valley. Also, more such projects are bound to follow and wreak havoc on the environment.” TOI had earlier reported that nine water sources of Mussoorie -- that account for nearly 65% of the town’s water supply -- are located in close proximity to this proposed tunnel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/foundation-stone-for-mussoorie-tunnel-expected-to-be-laid-next-month-environmentalists-raise-concerns/articleshow/87953956.cms||Anmol Jain

While fire engulfed the entire unit of the Rani Sati Mill, no casualties were reported. Surat Fire and Emergency Services (SFES) control room received a call at 10am after which a total 12 firefighting vehicles from 10 fire stations were rushed to the spot. “The fire engulfed the entire unit due to the oil supply network. The unit was closed and the fire started while restarting it after a gap of a few weeks,” said a fire official. “It’s a multi-storey structure housing large-size machinery and equipment placed at different levels. There is ducting for oil distribution which led to rapid spread of fire,” said an official. A team of forensic science laboratory will carry out an inspection of the unit to find out how the fire started. Three persons were present inside the unit at the time of the incident but they managed to come out before the fire spread. Cloth stored at the unit was gutted in the fire but the estimation of loss is yet to be done, sources said. “The fire was controlled in an hour and later the cooling was done.

---||Dehradun||Char Dham priests step up campaign against Devasthanam Board; CM says decision to be taken soon||Dehradun: After recently staging protests outside residences of state ministers in Dehradun, the Char Dham priests, who are upset with the delay in withdrawing of the contentious Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board, said that if the Act is not scrapped before November 30, they will intensify protests from December 1. The priests also took out a protest march -- Aakrosh Rally -- from Gandhi Park to the state secretariat in Dehradun on Saturday. As police stopped the protestors from crossing the barricading at Subhash Road, a minor scuffle also ensued between the two sides. The rally was held to mark the completion of two years since the proposal was passed by the state cabinet in 2019. Senior Congress members, including leader of Opposition Pritam Singh and Dehradun city chief Lal Chand Sharma, also participated in the protest to express solidarity with Char Dham priests. Brijesh Sati, the spokesperson of Char Dham Teerth Purohit Hak Hakookdhari Mahapanchayat, said, “We observe it as a Black Day as the state cabinet passed a proposal on the Devasthanam Board on November 2017, 2019. We will continue to oppose the law till it is withdrawn.” He also claimed that a minister has assured them that a decision would be taken on the issue by November 30. “If our demands are not met, we will intensify our protests from December 1,” he added. Meanwhile, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said that the committee formed by the government has handed over its final report and it would be studied by a cabinet sub-committee for the next two days. “Thereafter, we will take a call on the issue,” said the CM. He added that the board should not be compared with the issue of farm laws and their repeal. A few weeks back, the priests had stopped former CM Trivendra Singh Rawat from entering Kedarnath shrine. Minister Dhan Singh Rawat and BJP state chief Madan Kaushik were also made to sit in the Kedarnath area for more than an hour and hear out the demands of the priests. Notably, the priests of the Char Dham shrines and the government have been at loggerheads on the law since its inception. Amidst heavy protest from Congress, the bill was tabled and passed in the state assembly in December 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/char-dham-priests-step-up-campaign-against-devasthanam-board-cm-says-decision-to-be-taken-soon/articleshow/87953977.cms||Kautilya Singh

City police commissioner N Shashi Kumar, referring to both cases, said on Saturday that this was an attempt to divert the attention of police, who had intensified its investigation in various other cases, and to hurt sentiments of the public. The arrested accused are Safwan aka Chappu,25, Mohammed Suhaib,23, Praveen Anil Monteiro,27, Nikhilesh aka Vikki,22, Jayanth Kumar,30, Pratheek,24 and Manjunath,30 from the district and Naushad Arehalli,30, from Hassan. Most of them have been regular offenders. Safwan, Suhaib, Jayanth and Praveen have various pending cases against them, including cases booked under the NDPS Act. “The arrested accused were also in contact with accused in moral policing and chainsnatching cases. Following a series of chain snatching cases reported in the city, police had strengthened patrolling, which had affected the offenders. They decided to select nagabanas because there is a lot of sentiment attached to them, and these places have poor security, and are not frequented by people daily,” he said. “A deal was struck with one of the accused for Rs 10,000 to carry out the task of desecrating the Nagabana. The accused wanted to damage all the idols at the Nagabana in Kodikal, but since dogs started barking, they fled from the spot, after damaging an idol. A search is on to arrest more persons who provided shelter and vehicles to the accused,” the commissioner said. More than 40 police personnel from Urwa, Kavoor, Bajpe and Moodabidri were part of the investigation. Shashi Kumar handed over a cash reward of Rs 20,000 to inspector Raghav Padil of Kavoor police station and inspector Bharathi G of Urwa police station. Meanwhile, a special beat has been introduced to keep a watch on religious places. Mangaluru City North MLA Dr Bharath Shetty Y said there could be more suspects behind the crime. He also suspected the involvement of a political leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/8-arrested-for-desecrating-nagabana/articleshow/87953973.cms||---

---||Rajkot||Utter chaos at GRD recruitment drive||Palanpur: What was planned to be a simple police recruitment drive for gram rakshak dal (GRD) jawan, resulted in a stampede-like situation as hundreds of job aspirants along with their family members gathered outside the police headquarters in Palanpur in Banaskantha district on Saturday. A video of the incident with a handfull of cops trying to manage a sea of job-seekers has gone viral on the internet. The overwhelming crowd appeared like a human wave moving forward guided by stick-wielding cops. The chaos witnessed since Saturday morning resulted as the police authorities had invited 4,641 who had applied for the 171 vacancies of male GRD jawans. Police had a tough time controlling the crowd that swelled beyond their expectation. The government Covid-19 restrictions like wearing a mask and maintaining social distance all went down the drain. Congress MLA Geniben Thakore alleged, “This was total mismanagement by the police department. They failed to anticipate the number of candidates who would come for the recruitment drive. Had proper precautions been taken, this could have been avoided.” However, deputy superintendent of police R K Patel claimed that there was no question mismanagement and no force was used to control the crowd. “Many of the candidates had come with their relatives or parents, so there was a huge crowd. It was all managed well and recruitment drive was held as per norms,” Patel later told media persons. He added that on Sunday they have organised a recruitment drive for female GRD jawans and called 276 candidates for physical tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/utter-chaos-at-grd-recruitment-drive/articleshow/87953992.cms||---

Mudit Sachdeva, training and placement officer at the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Pune, said within two months 100% of the eligible students got jobs. Placements in core mechanical and civil engineering branches are yet to pick up, but placement officers hope the new semester will bring with it job offers. Anand Bhalerao, principal and dean, Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering said the institute is likely to record 100% placements. “This year, 92 companies visited in the first three months while placements stand at 82%, which is close to the last year’s final placements. Of 650 students, 533 have been placed. Last year, the final placement was 86%; we may reach 100% this year,” said Bhalerao. Most of the demand is from the IT sector, said Bhalerao, adding that many students also turned their internships into placement offers. Manoj Khaladkar, training and placement officer at the Army Institute of Technology, said final placements last year stood at 91%, but have already crossed 93% this year, with more time to go. “Not just IT products, but fintech, banks, consultancy, healthcare etc are also offering good packages. Lateral attrition in IT fields may be another reason for greater hiring of freshers,” said Khaladkar. Karthick Subramanian, head, central training and placement office, Vishwakarma Institutes, said the highest package has been Rs33 lakh so far. “IT companies are hiring in bulk. We have been training students in mechanical and other branches in Java and other IT-related courses due to which they were able to appear jobs in the IT services sector,” said Subramanian. “We anticipated that there will be more demand for mechanical students well-versed in programming languages,” said Subramaniam. Shitalkumar Rawandale, training and placement officer, Pimpri Chinchwad College of Engineering, said1,450 of 1,580 final year students have got offers so far. “There has been a 20% increase in the number of students placed compared to last year,” said Rawandale. Satish Narkhede, training and placement officer at Pune Institute of Computer Technology (PICT) said 85% students were placed in the first semester, which is nearly equal to the entire placements season last year. “Earlier, computer and IT branches would get priority, but this time electronics and telecommunication students got jobs along side,” said Narkhede. Sanjay Dhaygude, training placement officer at Walchand College of Engineering, said mechanical engineering students secured good jobs in core companies. “Even the number of students who got salary offers above Rs10-15 lakh has increased,” said Dhaygude.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/engineering-colleges-see-buzzing-placement-season/articleshow/87954573.cms||Ardhra Nair

Though Latham's name has been included in the record book of Green Park, he got his name in the list of nervous nineties players and figures at the 8th place. The first victim of the nervous nineties was Indian opener ML Jaisimha, who in a match against Pakistan in 1960, missed his coveted three figure mark by just one run and had scored 99 runs. It was his bad luck that in a hurry to complete his century he tried to steal a single and was declared run out. A year later (in 1961) VL Manjrekar became the second batsman who had missed his century by four runs against visiting the MCC team. Two more batsmen joined the band later and they were Tim Robinson and Gautam Gambhir. Both had presented their wickets on 96 runs each. Robinson of England had scored 96 in January 1985 while Gambhir missed his century against South Africa in November 2004. Sri Lankan Batsman JR Ratnayeke joined the band in December 1986 when he fell prey to Kapil Dev on 93. Kapil had trapped him in front of the wicket. MD Marshall, the medium-fast bowler of West Indies who had torn the Indian batting at Green Park in the 1983 test also figured his name in the list of nervous nineties. He had scored 92 runs before falling prey to Kapil Dev. He too was in a hurry to complete his century as the last batsman Winston Davis was on the crease at other ends. Ajit Wadekar was the next player who had hit 90 runs against England in 1973. Though Pakistan’s batsman Wasim Raja was not a victim of nervous nineties as he had returned unbeaten on 94 in December 1979 but the record book shows that he was among those batsmen who had scored 90-odd runs at the Green Park stadium. Tim Latham who was heading slowly towards his 100 was stumped by substitute wicket-keeper S Bharat on 95 when he dragged his feet out of the crease to block the delivery which deceived him and reached in the hands of wicket keeper Bharat who did his job beautifully. Latham who was very much cautious for his century had taken 80 minutes to reach from 80 to 95. Earlier, his overnight partner W Young had returned after scoring 89 runs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/tom-lathom-among-nervous-nineties-players-figures-at-8th-place/articleshow/87955104.cms||Anant Shekher Misra

Faced with repeated delays and postponement of National Eligibility Entrance Test postgraduate (NEET PG) counselling 2021, the association said it will withdraw from outpatient department (OPD) services from Monday if the counselling process is not fast-tracked. The association has demanded that resident doctors, who are in their second year now, be provided with medical officers (MO) to assist them till the new batch joins. They have also demanded the implementation of the ‘bond plus SR’ scheme for batches from 2018. “The bond policy must be revised for students who have completed MBBS, PG and/or super-specialty from the state of Gujarat. The lower degree bond must be dissolved into the higher degree bond of that candidate,” according to their representation. As a result, only higher degree bond remains to be served, it further stated. “There is wastage of time, knowledge and money and resources if a specialist is made to work like simple MBBS MO or super-specialist is made to work like specialist. For example, if candidate has done MBBS and MD both from Gujarat then the government should impose bond of MD degree only,” the JDA has demanded. The bond posting must be according to the branch only and PG candidates must not be forced to work as MBBS MO, said a JDA member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/change-bond-rules-say-resident-docs/articleshow/87954576.cms||---

The arrested accused has been identified as Devidas Shikhre, of Gaajgaon in Gangapur tehsil of the district. Crime branch inspector Avinash Aghav said the accused has confessed to stealing the bikes from the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), and MIDC Waluj areas. Police said Shikhre has confessed that he preferred targeting vehicles parked at these two places as he could have adequate time to break open the locks of the vehicles. Crime branch sources said that while fleeing with the stolen bikes, the accused was caught in at least three different CCTV cameras. Authorities said that all the bike recoveries have been made from Shikhre’s house, where he had parked the vehicles and covered them. Aghav said the accused was looking for prospective customers willing to buy stolen bikes from him at throwaway prices, when one of his subordinates in the crime branch learnt about it and laid a trap. Shikhre was tracked down on Friday and within no time, he confessed. On Saturday, Shikhre was handed over to the Waluj police station for further investigation.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-city-crime-branch-team-recovers-13-stolen-bikes-from-suspect/articleshow/87953450.cms||---

The calf was dragged for a few metres before the train could be stopped. “A herd of elephants was moving on the track around 1:30 am on Saturday when the loco-pilot of this goods train sounded the whistle. While all the others moved away from the track, a male calf suddenly appeared on the track,” said Mahendra Giri, ranger officer, Motichur range, Rajaji Tiger Reserve. He added that a case has been registered against the loco-pilot. The postmortem report of the calf has ascertained that collision and internal bleeding led to the death. Notably, the stretch from Haridwar forest division to Harrawala -- part of the Shivalik elephant reserve -- has a significant population of elephants. The accident has raised questions on the claims of the Indian Railways and the state forest department that early warning systems have been installed in the zone. In a similar accident in August, an adult female and its calf were killed on the spot after being hit by the speeding Agra Fort Express, which was heading from Lalkuan to Ramnagar. The incident took place in the Terai Central Forest division of the Kumaon region. Before this, a three-year-old elephant was killed on railway tracks in the Nakraunda area of the Dehradun forest division in July 2020. Uttarakhand is home to about 2,000 elephants. Thus, the state government’s plan to come up with rail networks cutting through the forests, which is habitat of these wild animals, has raised eyebrows of wildlife lovers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/elephant-calf-mowed-down-by-train-in-rajaji-tiger-reserve/articleshow/87953981.cms||Shivani Azad

RTI activist Jeetendra Ghadge of The Young Whistleblowers Foundation, who got the data, said ACB filed very few cases of disproportionate assets against BMC staff. “With reference to disproportionate asset cases, it seems ACB was unable to register more cases mainly as complainants do not want to be identified.

---||Meerut||Why 92 UP villages break into battle every year after monsoon||BIJNOR: It's become a bloody annual affair now. After every monsoon, in roughly 92 villages of UP around the districts of Bijnor, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Amroha and neighbouring Uttarakhand, villagers gird up for territorial battles over claims on farm lands whose boundaries change with the Ganga's inevitable course deviation. This year two farmers were killed and many others injured. Past years have seen more casualties. Fed up with the unceasing bloodshed, thousands of villagers say they have only one hope -- that the snail-paced land survey being conducted for the last 15 years gets completed soon. But the survey department has its own problems. It requires a staff of about 150, but is managing with just 30. Moreover, old maps of the region are drawn in Persian and the department has no translator. No wonder, then, that out of the 92 villages the survey has been done only for five in 15 years. "There are reasons for the delay," said Devendra Singh, Bijnor sub-divisional magistrate. "We don't have sufficient staff and lack an adequate budget. The river changes its course every year during monsoon and it's difficult to keep pace with the changing boundaries," he explained. With the rainy season over, rivers here have changed course yet again and redefined land holdings. Bijnor SP Dharamveer Singh said, "We register dozens of cases every year related to land disputes and this year may not be any different." Farmers say they have no option but to fight, often using weapons as it becomes a do-or-die war. Bijendra Singh's land is on the Bijnor-Muzaffarnagar border and due to the Ganga nearby demarcations frequently get blurred. "People come from Muzaffarnagar and try to grab our land. They run their tractors on our standing crop," the resident of Rawali said. Zakeer Ahmed, a farmer from Ameerpur, faces a similar problem. “We have land ownership papers, but tributaries of the Ganga keep redrawing the borders. And government records are not updated." The clashes, at times, can turn deadly. In January this year, five men allegedly shot two farmers while they were asleep in Khadar, a village on the Muzaffarnagar-Bijnor border. Four years ago, a 42-year-old Dalit farmer set himself on fire inside a police station in Mandawar area of Bijnor alleging that his land had been taken away. Bijnor's new DM, Umesh Mishra, said, "When I came here, the Ganga was overflowing. Now the water has receded. To sort out land disputes, a joint team from neighbouring districts is working on the survey. Additional staff will be roped in." Several police pickets have been set up, the most recent one at Pandav Nagar, to control and stop the fights, added SP Dharamveer Singh. Assurances apart, local police and villagers once again have their task cut out. Thanas are on alert as it's time for yet another season of battle to begin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/why-92-up-villages-break-into-battle-every-year-after-monsoon/articleshow/87954009.cms||Harveer Dabas

He along with a group of eco-activists had made efforts to protect the tree. With pruning, the tree is sure to die. “The rare species of palmyra will probably go extinct if not protected. It is a flowering plant with the largest inflorescence in the world. This special plant variety flowers once in 32, 66,70 or 100 years,” Krishnaiah said.  “About two years ago, we were successful in saving a similar tree in Udupi, after convincing the property owner. However, this time despite trying to convince the owner through religious heads and local leaders, we could not save the tree from getting pruned. There are several myths regarding the tree. One such is that the blossoming of the tree is inauspicious to the owner of that place or village.” “The talipot palm, when in blossom, bears the cone of golden-coloured flowers of about 15 ft height, which it is believed, when ripe, bursts with a loud noise and diffuses a smell. Sritala palm tree after flowering, produces nearly two lakh nuts or seeds, and dies within two years,” he said. Trees to be mapped A team including Saralebettu Ganesh Raj, S A Krishnaiah, Dinesh Rai, Shrutesh Acharya, Ravi Alva, Musica Supriya, Sujaya K S and Shobha Karnik, have decided to spread awareness on the importance of palm trees and initiate mapping the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/superstition-puts-talipot-palm-tree-at-risk-expert/articleshow/87954005.cms||---

They have asked to be treated as the ‘fourth tier’ of governance. The plea came up in the 8th National Conference of Resident Welfare Associations (NCRWA) organised on November 23 and 24 at Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh. On Saturday, the United Federation of RWAs (UFERWAS) delegation, who take part, released key resolutions which were passed. Col Tejendra Pal Tyagi, chief convener, national conference, opined that the RWAs are mini-municipalities, while still being much bigger than many village panchayats that are given the status of a separate local government. V V Rao, who represented Telangana, said that among the points highlighted was that storm water management must be integrated with recharge and disposal facilities. Eleven proposals were made which were subsequently passed as resolutions. These include RWAs mentioning specific commitments for mitigation of climate change and launching an appeal to RERA authorities for representation to RWAs in mediation cells, said UFERWAS, general secretary, B T Srinivasan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/give-us-constitutional-status-rwas/articleshow/87954588.cms||Sunil Mungara

He had refrained from contesting in the 2017 assembly elections so that Jignesh Mevani could stand as an independent candidate from Vadgam with outside support from the Congress. Sources said the BJP is likely to field Vaghela against Mevani for the Vadgam seat even as the independent MLA is expected to formally join the Congress just before next year’s assembly election. In his resignation letter dated November 19 which he addressed to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Vaghela expressed displeasure with the Congress’ working style, ideology and “disregard” towards junior workers. He wrote that he had been a dedicated Congress worker for 40 years and had defeated a BJP cabinet minister — Fakir Vaghela — to win the Vadgam seat in 2012.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ex-vadgam-mla-quits-cong/articleshow/87954593.cms||---

The children sustained serious head injuries. They have been admitted in a private hospital at Dhankawadi. The two injured boys are aged five and six years, while the injured girl is six years’ old, police said. According to the FIR, the corporator arranged a special screening of the film — Jai Bhim — at an open plot at Sahakarnagar for local residents and the children on the occasion of Constitution Day. The screen was put up at an open plot in Sahakarnagar. TOI on Saturday evening made repeated calls to the corporator but his mobile phone was switched off. Senior police inspector Swati Desai of Sahakarnagar police said, “After receiving information from the hospital authorities, we registered a case suo-motu.” “The parents of the children were not ready to register the case despite police approaching them. One of the children is in a critical condition,” Desai said. Desai said, “The children were sitting near the screen. The power cables were attached to the screen and these were suspended over a kaccha road passing through an open plot. The power cable got stuck in a tempo passing through the spot and the resultant pull brought the digital screen crashing down on three children,” she said. Desai said, “The organiser (the corporator) and his men should have taken adequate safety measures to avert the accident while putting up the huge digital screen at the spot. They neglected the safety of the people. On the other hand, the tempo driver was careless while passing from the site. He should have averted contact with the overhead power cables.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/3-kids-injured-as-digital-screen-falls-on-them/articleshow/87954587.cms||---

Active cases now account for less than 1% of total cases in India. Currently at 0.32%, it is the lowest since March 2020. Daily positivity rate is now 0.89 % and has been less than 2% for the last 54 days. A total of 120.27 crore vaccination doses have been given. On an average the country is seeing 10,000 plus new cases and 400 to 500 deaths daily, with maximum number of new cases and daily deaths being reported from Kerala. “Hybrid immunity is extremely effective and is protecting the country from a third Covid wave despite people flouting Covid norms and many avoiding the second dose of the vaccine. This protection will continue unless a new and very different mutant appears,” said Dr Padmanabha Shenoy, whose paper “Hybrid immunity versus vaccine-induced immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases” was recently published in the Lancet. The study showed that in rheumatic diseases patients infected with Covid-19, a single dose of vaccine provided a higher humoral response when compared with those who had no Covid infection but had taken two doses of the vaccine. However, public health experts said that though hybrid immunity may keep the pandemic initially on a warmer, but then within a few weeks things will start to boil over. There are several contributory factors responsible for surge in cases increasingly irresponsible behaviour, over relaxation of restrictions and denial that the pandemic is still here. “It is not just hybrid immunity alone but also the natural cyclical pattern of the disease due to which we are not seeing a surge in India now. In contrast, Europe is in a surge phase now, and that is even involving countries with the highest vaccination coverage,” said Dr Rajeev Jayadevan, vice-chairman, research cell, IMA Kerala. But will India again see a surge in Covid cases, what with a new coronavirus variant identified in southern Africa earlier this week, that scientists fear is very different to the others that have emerged so far and is the most heavily mutated version yet? “We will never get into the epidemic phase again as about 90% to 95% of the population are now immune to the virus and another 30% have been fully vaccinated in the country. Covid cases are few here now because the epidemic has burned down and since the last five months we are in an endemic phase,” said well-known virologist Dr Jacob John T.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/is-hybrid-immunity-keeping-third-wave-at-bay/articleshow/87954052.cms||Preetu Nair

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: SMC headquarters Muglisara declared waqf property||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat State Waqf Board has declared that the Muglisara (Mughalsarai) building, which is the headquarters of the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC), is a waqf property. It has ordered that the building be registered as a waqf property. The board said that during the reign of Mughal emperor Shah Jehan, Surat was his daughter Jahanara Begum’s fief. Her confidante Ishaqbail Yazdi aka Haqiqat Khan had constructed the building in 1644 AD at a cost of Rs 33,081, named it Humayun Sarai, and donated it to be used as an inn for Haj pilgrims as Surat was a major port on the west coast. As it was donated as waqf property by a Muslim ruler, the purpose of the property does not change. The board cited Islamic sharia and the Supreme Court’s declaration that ‘once a waqf property, always a waqf property’. Abdul Wadood Jarullah petitioned the Waqf Board in 2015-16 to declare Muglisara a waqf property under Section 36 of the Waqf Act, 1995. Following his request, the Central Waqf Council also wrote to the board to act on Jarullah’s application. As proceedings did not move further, Jarullah approached the Gujarat high court for quick proceedings. Jarullah supplied 17 documents to establish that the nearly 400-year-old building was in use as an inn for Haj pilgrims till 1867, when it was first used as a municipal office by the British as there was no place from which the new civic body could function. In 1961, the building became the SMC headquarters and the civic body’s name was added in the revenue records. He argued that as the building was built for the purpose of social work and donated in waqf, it should be declared waqf property. Among the historical documents on which he relied, was a plaque on the front wall which contained information that the building was given in waqf by the Mughal ruler. The SMC opposed the bid and supplied eight documents. It argued that the building had been handed over to the British government in 1867 and revenue records were altered in 1961.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/smc-headquarters-muglisara-declared-waqf-property/articleshow/87954611.cms||---
---||Agra||Omicron scare: Agra to screen visitors with recent foreign tour history||AGRA: Following reports of the detection of a new variant of coronavirus (B.1.1.529, renamed Omicron) in South Africa, Botswana, Hong Kong, Israel and Belgium, the health department in Agra district has sounded an alert to check visitors from these countries, who come to see the Taj Mahal as well as for business the with makers of shoes and carpets. According to healthcare experts, the Omicron is said to be spreading faster than Delta, another variant of the coronavirus. It has over 30 mutations, more than any other variant, and experts fear it may be resistant to vaccines. Given the scenario which has prompted countries like the US to ban travel to African countries, the health department here is preparing to face any eventuality as Agra city witnesses a huge footfall of both foreign and domestic visitors, especially in winter. Dr Arun Kumar Srivastava, chief medical officer of Agra district, said, “Four rapid response teams have been constituted to gather details of the people with recent travel history to foreign countries. All these people will be screened by doctors and they will have to undergo RT-PCR test after eight days of their arrival. We will also vaccinate people screened if they have not been administered a dose . Hotel associations have been asked to report people with recent travel history checking in. All the hospitals have also been directed to be prepared to prevent the spread of the new variant of Covid-19.” The CMO added, “So far, a majority of the people tested with Omicron variant are asymptomatic. Therefore, we will have to do health surveillance on people with recent travel history for at least 14 days. Those having any symptoms will be isolated. Arrangements are being made in this regard,” the CMO said. The health department on Saturday released two contact numbers -- 0562-2600418 and 2600508 -- to get information regarding people with overseas travel history. The last case of Covid-19 in Agra was reported on November 20. A 50-year-old representative of a shoe company, who had travelled to Poland, is the only active Covid-19 case in the district. The health department had sent the samples of the man for genome sequencing. The lab report is awaited, the CMO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/omicron-scare-agra-city-to-screen-visitors-with-recent-foreign-tour-history/articleshow/87954029.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Kochi||Govt issues notification to take over land for Atlantis railway overbridge||Kochi: Ending the long wait of Kochiites, the government has issued notification for acquiring land for Atlantis railway overbridge (RoB). The construction of the RoB is expected to help reduce traffic snarls in the city to a certain extent. Ironically, the allotment of funds and completion of various procedures, which happen once in a blue moon, shed light on how the absence of proper planning and supervision cause cost escalation and delay project execution. During 2012-15, the authorities had allotted Rs 70 crore for the project. Though some holdings have been acquired using the amount, the work couldn’t be even started. The government had included the project in the 2016-17 budget. Later, the government allotted Rs 89 crore from Kerala infrastructure investment fund board (KIIFB) for the construction of the RoB in 2018. Once the RoB becomes a reality, it will ensure a smooth commute between Panampilly Nagar and Atlantis Junction on MG Road. It will help address traffic congestion on Sahodaran Ayyappan Road and Pallimukku area. “We had given a memorandum to industries minister P Rajeeve to expedite the project. The roads and bridges corporation of Kerala (RBDC-K) will be constructing the bridge. Now, the minister would be monitoring the progress of the work at fixed intervals. We expect that the project can be commissioned without much delay,” mayor M Anil Kumar said. Now, the government has entrusted a special tahsildar, land acquisition for KIIFB projects, to carry out the acquisition procedures for the RoB. Around 0.0599 hectares of land will have to be acquired for the project. If any of the landowners have objections regarding the acquisition, they should give their written statement to the officials’ in-charge of the land acquisition. At the same time, authorities are yet to take measures to construct RoBs at Vaduthala and Vathuruthy. The state government had allocated Rs 47.5 crore for Vaduthala RoB in 2016-17. But, the work couldn’t be started due to various reasons. Railways, which had prolonged its nod, gave the approval in January 2021. Now, the protest by a section of residents and some of the religious institutions are posing hurdles for acquiring land for Vaduthala RoB. “The RoB at Vaduthala should be completed at the earliest. Absence of an overbridge at Vaduthala is causing huge traffic bottlenecks in the heart of the city,” said corporation opposition leader Antony Kureethra. Similarly, the government had allotted funds for Vathuruthy RoB in 2016-17. Though Rs 20 crore was allotted for the project, the work is yet to be started. “The construction of an overbridge at Vathuruthy will ease traffic to the city from West Kochi and Willingdon Island areas. Moreover, the harbour terminus can also be revived once the RoB is constructed at Vathuruthy,” Kureethra said. A dispute over acquiring land in possession of Cochin Port Trust is the major problem to be sorted out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/govt-issues-notification-to-take-over-land-for-atlantis-railway-overbridge/articleshow/87954027.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

---||Aurangabad||Highway land demarcation ends in Kolhapur region||Kolhapur: The land demarcation work, between the Shiye and Padwalwadi villages in Kolhapur region, for the proposed Nagpur-Ratnagiri National Highway was completed amid the objections raised by a few villagers. The demarcation work was carried out by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) along with the state land records department. Of the 66 survey numbers (lands), nine have been left out of the demarcation process due to protests by some farmers. With the land demarcation work completed, the highway authority will start with the land evaluation work. Few of the villagers have demanded five times the ready reckoner cost uniformly for all the property owners whose land will be acquired for the proposed highway. The ready reckoner is the cost of land as per government evaluation. Earlier, the residents of the Bhuyewadi and Bhuye villages had given their written objections over the land acquisition process to the district collector, and the decision over the same is pending. The land demarcation process had started before the hearing of the villagers' objections, and this had angered the villagers. The villagers tried to obstruct the demarcation process along with former MLA Chandradeep Narke when the work had started on Thursday. Of the 66 survey numbers to be demarcated, three from Bhuyewadi and six from Bhuye village are still pending due to the farmers' opposition. Chandrakant Bharde, the NHAI engineer, said, “The land demarcation of all the areas coming in Kolhapur district — from Amba in Shahuwadi tehsil to Chokak village in Hatkanangle tehsil — has been completed. A few survey numbers in the Bhuye and Bhuyewadi are pending and the decision on the same will be taken at the administrative level.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/highway-land-demarcation-ends-in-kolhapur-region/articleshow/87953477.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Data available with TOI shows that as of the second week of November, the targeted admissions to Dakshina Kannada government schools was 98,532 students but the schools got 1,02,518 students, an additional 3,986 admissions. That’s an increase by 4 per cent. In aided schools, the district has seen a 10 per cent increase. Admissions are up from 46,229 to 50,847. The numbers are likely to increase as the admission process is on till November-end. The numbers have dropped by 4 per cent in unaided schools. Out of seven BEO blocks, only Moodbidri has achieved its 100 per cent admission target. Others have not. DDPI Malleswamy said that among the government schools, in the Mangaluru South BEO limits, admissions stand at 108.84 per cent of the target. The target admissions were 9,750, which now increased to 10,612. In aided schools, the Puttur BEO limits has witnessed a growth of 15.33 per cent in admissions, followed by Sullia BEO limits at 14.16 per cent. Malleswamy said that a key factor is expense. Parents have been unable to pay for private schools because of the financial situation. Many have removed their children from private schools and enrolled them in government schools. A large number of students have migrated from unaided schools to Kannada-English (bilingual) medium institutions. Many students from Dakshina Kannada also studied in other districts but have moved back to their hometown, said another senior official in the department of public instruction. Also, some students who were earlier in residential schools have now enrolled in schools close to their homes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/surge-in-admissions-to-govt-schools-in-dk-dist/articleshow/87954036.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

This even as BMC board of administrators’ chairperson Krishna Chakraborty has appealed to residents on Facebook to keep rooftops and other areas of their houses clean to prevent accumulation of stagnant water and breeding of mosquitoes. Notices have already been issued to several such households, asking them to immediately clean up their premises as the civic teams will revisit the houses to check whether the instructions have been complied with or not. “If mosquito larvae are found for the second time in the same houses, notice boards will be put up stating this and appropriate steps will be taken,” said a BMC official.On Friday, Krishna Chakraborty along with a civic team visited several houses in the blocks at her ward. In one such house where there is a dengue patient, mosquito larvae were found inside a bucket on the roof. “Mosquito larvae are being found in many houses inside pots, jars and buckets on roof tops and other places. Our teams are visiting houses across Salt Lake. We are appealing to all residents to cooperate with us and asking them to keep their premises clean so that there is no breeding of mosquito larvae. We will soon hold a citizens’ meeting on this issue,” Chakraborty said.

---||Kochi||Transport authority conducts survey to identify needs of bus passengers||Kochi: Unified metropolitan transport authority (UMTA) is conducting a demand assessment survey as part of route rationalization of buses in the Greater Cochin area. The survey is to identify the demands of passengers, before implementing rationalization. The survey is funded by French development agency AFD and is expected to be completed in two months. For this, 40 surveyors equipped with hand-held tablet computers will be deployed to various destinations like bus stops in the Greater Cochin area. UMTA has already identified some routes for rationalization. But the survey is conducted to understand the demands, preferences and needs of passengers. “The survey will look into various aspects, including peak travel time, daily travel route, number of buses plying on a particular route at a particular time and category of travellers — students or others. The agency will submit the findings of the survey and we can use it for transport planning,” said UMTA managing director Shanavas S. As per the ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA) standard, 1,000 buses are needed for 10 lakh people in urban areas. Going by the rule book, Greater Cochin region, which has a population of 21 lakh, will require 2,100 buses. Currently, only less than 1,000 private buses and a few hundred KSRTC buses operate in the region.  It calls for augmenting the availability of buses, ensure bus service as per the demand of the public and ensure that passengers get bus timings at their fingertips. “We have to create demand for public transport among the public. For that, we need to identify what their demands are. The survey will help us identify this,” said a source in UMTA. The surveyors will visit various spots on the road and interact with passengers to know their needs. The Survey is conducted jointly by SYSTRA France and SYSTRA India. The findings of the survey will be compiled using the application of French company Jungle Bus. The replies of the passengers will be uploaded in the app at the spot itself and it will reach the server instantly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/transport-authority-conducts-survey-to-identify-needs-of-bus-passengers/articleshow/87954034.cms||T C Sreemol

The state government held the examination to recruit Group-D employees for the health department at various centres across Maharashtra on October 31. Health department chief administrative officer Smita Karegaonkar, a resident of Vadgaon Sheri, had submitted a complaint application in this regard with the Cyber police, and after an inquiry the police registered the case on Friday. According to the FIR, the unidentified persons obtained details of 92 questions out of the total 100 before the examination started and circulated them among the aspiring candidates using a messaging application. The police said the suspects not only cheated the government but also the other candidates appearing for the examination. The examination was cancelled after the revelation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/source-of-health-dept-exam-paper-leak-traced/articleshow/87954615.cms||---

The mosque is close to the Krishna Janmasthan temple. "Section 144 is already in force in the district," said SSP (Mathura) Guarav Grover. “Strict action will be taken against those found indulging in rumour mongering or trying to disrupt the peaceful atmosphere of the town. We have received information that some organisations are trying to hold an event or a foot march (to the idgah) on December 6." The SSP has appealed to people to work with police in maintaining law and order. The administration has also established communication with members of the minority community to instil confidence. “No one will be allowed to do any mischief," said circle officer (city) Abhishek Tewari, who interacted with minority community leaders in Mathura and assured them that the administration has put safeguards in place. The threat to perform the "ritual" at the idgah has come at a time when a local court is hearing a bunch of petitions seeking "removal" of the 17th century mosque. Police, however, said no permission for any programme has been issued and none will be granted. Members of the Quami Ekta Manch in Mathura have urged chief minister Yogi Adityanath to provide additional security on December 6. Founder of the Manch, Madhuvan Dutt Chaturvedi, said it has been 53 years since an agreement was signed between the managements of the Shahi Idgah and Sri Krishna Janmasthan Sansthan to maintain status quo. "We can't let that break," he said. Recently, the All India Teerth Purohit Mahasabha, a 60-year-old body of over 90 temple priests from across India, said that this issue is being raked up unnecessarily and that all concerned parties should be all the more careful as assembly polls are just around the corner in UP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/security-stepped-up-in-mathura-section-144-imposed/articleshow/87954050.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The doctor runs a dental clinic in Navi Sangvi area. He has lodged an FIR in this regard with the Sangvi police station on November 26. According to the police, the incident occurred between September 4, 2020, and November 26. The doctor had come in contact with the accused through his relatives, said the police. “The complainant said one of the accused had told him that he works in the Mantralay, and he will give him a job in the ministry. For this purpose, he had paid the amount through multiple transactions, including through cheques,” said investigating officer Dilip Jadhav, assistant police inspector of Sangvi police station. Jadhav said they are verifying every information provided by the complainant in his statement. “We have sought details from the Mantralay to check the authenticity of the person. At this juncture, we are in the process of getting necessary information related to the fraud to establish further links in the case,” Jadhav added. The police said the government has a proper procedure for the recruitment of each posting. Therefore, people should study the procedure before paying money to people for securing jobs in the government. “Many fraudsters take advantage of people’s desperation to get government jobs and take money from them. We register at least 20 such cases in a year across all police stations under the jurisdiction of the Pimpri Chinchwad police commissionerate,” said a senior police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/doctor-duped-of-rs-1-6cr-over-govt-job-promise/articleshow/87954628.cms||---

According to a university official, a final decision will be taken at the Board of Examination meeting scheduled for December 15. Officials indicated that since colleges have started offline classes, the university is also planning for a completely offline examination. “We need to keep the prestige and quality of the university intact. Now that colleges have already reopened and are holding in-person classes, we can also have examinations offline,” said a senior university official. The students’ argument that since classes were held online, exams must also be online is not correct, said the official. “Examinations are important and we need a fair and transparent method for all students. Keeping all this in mind, offline examinations will be good. But then, it is again up to the BOE and the university officials to make the final decision,” said the senior official. Fully vaccinated students have been allowed in colleges to attend classes since October 20. Earlier in November, a survey by Yukrand, a union of SPPU students, had said that most would still prefer online examinations. Around 93% of 21,000 students surveyed said they would prefer to give exams online.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/university-to-hold-offline-exams-from-jan-2nd-week/articleshow/87954631.cms||---
---||Agra||Two minor girls sexually assaulted in Agra and Vrindavan||AGRA: Two minor girls, including a Dalit, were sexually assaulted in separate incidents in Agra and Vrindavan on Thursday. Both the accused were neighbours of the survivors. The suspect in the Vrindavan case is a 16-year-old minor. The first case pertains to a 6-year-old girl, who had gone to government primary school in Agra with other children on Thursday morning. She was picked from school by her 22-year-old neighbour, identified as Bobby, who allegedly sexually assaulted her. Station house officer of the area where the incident took place, said that police have registered an FIR under IPC section 376 and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. Talking to TOI, the girl’s father, a labourer, said that Bobby pretended to be the girl’s brother and requested the school teacher to allow her to go with him as she was unwell. “My daughter was crying when she came back home at 12:30 pm, but she did not tell the reason,” he said, adding that she later shared details about the incident with her aunt. Her father then reached out to the police and registered a complaint against Bobby, who was arrested and remanded to judicial custody. In Vrindavan, a 7-year-old Dalit girl was allegedly sexually assaulted by her 16-year-old neighbour, who took her with him on the pretext of giving her toffees while she was playing outside her house. In the FIR, the girl’s father stated that his niece had witnessed the suspect raping her cousin. The boy ran away, when she cried out for help. The girl’s family alleged that they approached the boy’s family to inform them about his act, but they misbehaved with them and passed casteist remarks. SP (city) MP Singh said that an FIR has been registered against the suspect under IPC section 376, along with POCSO and SC/ST Act. The boy was taken into custody and later sent to a juvenile home, he added.

According to the medical and health department data, about 1.96 crore people have not received their second dose of vaccination even after the due date. The home department has been directed to issue restrictions on the unvaccinated or partially vaccinated from visiting public places, such as movie theatres, restaurants, and functions. The suggestion was given at a review meeting convened by the chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday in view of the new South African 'variant of high concern' (Omicron) being detected in some countries. Doctors said the new South African variant Omicron(B-11529) had emerged from people suffering from HIV-AIDS and was found to be more virulent, contagious and fatal. The meeting emphasised on the importance of following Covid-appropriate behaviour and vaccination to reduce mortality. The medical and health department said tribal district, Pratapgarh, had achieved a record 100 per cent people with the first dose and 76 per cent with both doses, while the state average on first and second jabs is at 84 per cent and 54 per cent and at the national level it is at 83 per cent and 46 per cent. The meeting noted that though some fully vaccinated people contracted the virus, no one needed hospitalization. Currently, only one patient is admitted at the RUHS even though the state has 187 active cases. Among the infected, 11 per cent had received the first dose of vaccination, while 63 per cent had received the second dose. The people infected have a history of travel and contact with patients, officials informed at the meeting. The meet stressed the need for administering the second dose of vaccine as the state had a vaccine stock of about one crore. Officials informed that in November, three districts, including Jaipur, Ajmer, and Alwar, reported the maximum number of cases with Jaipur recording the highest number of over 100 cases. Secretary of medical education, Vaibhav Galriya, informed that on average about 25,000 tests were done daily, which was sufficient in the present situation. He said 415 out of 550 oxygen plants with a capacity of 400 metric tonnes of oxygen had been commissioned and the remaining would be completed within 15 days. He also said the department had set up an oxygen bank with a stock of about 40,000 oxygen concentrators, which could be issued to people on demand. The CM expressed concern over the increasing cases of dengue and high mortality. He directed the local bodies department to intensify cleanliness drives and fogging to control mosquitoes. He also directed the officials to disperse the compensation to the corona warriors and funds under the relief scheme announced to widows and orphans. It was informed that over 8,000 widows, 353 children, and about 200 doctors’ families were given compensation. The chief minister also directed all journalists, who died on duty during the pandemic, will be given compensation, irrespective of accreditation. Medical and health minister, Parsadilal Meena, emphasised the need for strengthening diagnostic facilities at the CHC and PHC levels to fight dengue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-mulls-covid-restrictions-for-the-unvaccinated/articleshow/87955129.cms||---

Vigilance sources said the properties are registered in the names of DLAO’s wife Amita Rani, his two sons, mother Girija Devi, brother Pawan Kumar Gupta and sister-in-law (brother’s wife) Dimple Devi. Sources said at the time of registration of case against Gupta and his family members on Thursday, vigilance knew about disproportionate assets worth only Rs 90 lakh, but the raids led to detection of DA worth Rs 1.73 crore. The raids were conducted at Gupta’s two flats in Anandpuri and Nageshwar Colony in Patna, a lavish house with expensive interior designing at his native place in Forbesganj, and his office and official residence in Sasaram. Sources said a woman event manager lived in the Nageshwar Colony flat of Gupta on rent and nothing was recovered from there. They added 39 property documents were recovered from Gupta’s houses at Anandpuri and Forbesganj. “Among the properties, six flats are in Patna and a four-bigha plot in Purnia. A property document showing 55,000 square feet plot in Ranchi was also seized. This property alone would be worth several crores,” a vigilance source said. The vigilance sleuths also seized Rs 21.72 lakh in cash, jewellery, gold biscuits and a gold pen Rs 61.67 lakh, passbooks of 25 bank accounts, six debit cards and two lockers. A senior vigilance officer said they are yet to calculate the deed value of the 39 properties. “Details from banks are also awaited. The DA value might double after all the documents are scrutinised. Estimated market value of all movable and immovable properties may be worth around Rs 10 crore,” a senior officer said. Gupta had joined service on January 11, 1996 and his annual income from salary is around Rs 90 lakh. “The estimated income of Gupta and his family members is Rs 1.7 crore. His estimated expenditure is Rs 38 lakh, including Rs 8 lakh on children’s education,” an officer said.

Ernakulam DCC president Mohammed Shiyas, who inaugurated the protest, said that all the roads in the corporation limits were in bad condition. It was due to apathy and inefficiency on the part of the corporation authorities that even the roads which were relayed using BMBC method recently also got damaged, Shiyas said. “Many of the roads in the city are in a bad condition. But authorities are not repairing such roads despite public outcry in this regard,” said opposition leader Antony Kureethra. Kaloor-Kathrikadavu Road, Thammanam-Pulleppady Road and many bylanes in the city are in a dilapidated condition. Corporation authorities have said that they are facing a financial crisis that there isn’t money for buying bitumen required for relaying and repairing roads. Kureethra said that the UDF will continue with the strike if the authorities fail to wake up from their slumber in the coming days. Councillors like Deepthi Mary Varghese, V K Minimol, M G Aristotle, Manu Jacob, Tibin Devassy and Sakkir Thammanam took part in the protest. Later, police removed the protesters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/roads-in-bad-state-udf-councillors-stage-sit-in/articleshow/87954051.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Ex-MMiC, councillors dropped from KMC fray||Kolkata: Several Trinamool heavyweights, including a former MMiC, three KMC borough chairpersons and several councillors who have been part of the civic body for several years, have been kept out of the candidate list. The chairman of borough IX, Ratan Malakar, is one of those who have left out. Malakar would have contested the KMC elections for the fifth time in a row had the party leadership nominated him from his Ward 73 (Harish Mukherjee Road) this time. Malakar, who has represented Trinamool in the KMC for 21 years, is yet to decide his future course of action. When contacted, he declined to comment. Also left out from the fray is Ratan De who, apart from being a councillor of Ward 93 (Jodhpur Park), also oversaw the civic body’s roads department as a member of the outgoing KMC board. De has been associated with the KMC elections since 2000 and had held several KMC portfolios. De couldn’t be reached on phone. Among the other notable dropouts is Smita Bakshi, a former Trinamool MLA, who was the chairperson of Borough IV. “I am not going to be affected by such a decision. I am a disciplined soldier of the party and will contribute to my city in whatever way the party will ask me to do,” Bakshi told TOI. Sadhan Saha, an octogenarian and the chairman of Borough II, has also not received a ticket but hopes the party leadership would think afresh and engage him in civic services in north Kolkata. “I have been taking care of large parts of north Kolkata as a borough chairman for the past 11 years. That I have been dropped from the fray does not mean I won’t offer my services to citizens. I believe I shall be given fresh assignments on behalf of the party leadership,” Saha said. Dissent is brewing among some resident of the Ballygunge-Gariahat belt over the nomination of the late Subrata Mukherjee’s sister Tanima Chatterjee in place of Sudarshana Mukherjee. Several citizens’ groups from Ballygunge and Rashbehari have launched a social media campaign in support of Mukherjee, who has not been nominated. When TOI contacted Mukherjee, she declined to comment. Shantanu Sen, Trinamool’s Rajya Sabha MP, has not been nominated either but he has been replaced by his wife, Kakoli Sen, as the party candidate for KMC Ward 2. Sayan Deb Chatterjee, agriculture minister Sovandeb Chattopadhyay’s son and a Trinamool Youth Congress secretary, also took to Twitter on Saturday to rubbish speculation about an earlier post, which was being interpreted as discont over denial of a party ticket. He had earlier posted, “When they needed his sacrifice, they assured, when the sacrifice was made, they said—it’s not yet time. Moral of the Story—until it’s your time, keep clapping for others.” He clarified later, “A lot of speculation has been going on relating to my earlier tweet with a lot of corners trying to spice it up. Politically, I convey my bestest wishes to all AITC nominated candidates in the upcoming KMC elections. We will win. Didi will win.

---||Dehradun||India, Nepal share progress on construction of bridges to ease cross-border movement||Pithoragarh: A range of issues were discussed between the district-level officers of Indian and Nepal on Saturday in the first such meeting held after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. During the meeting -- attended by district officials of Pithoragarh (India) and Darchula and Baitadi (both in Nepal) -- it was decided that the citizens of both nations, who cross the border, will have to produce an identity card and strictly follow the Covid-19 protocols. Among other crucial issues discussed during the meeting was the construction of a motor bridge at Charchhum (in Pithoragarh) and a suspension bridge at Alagad (also in Pithoragarh) to facilitate cross-border movement. A consensus was reached in regards to the construction of these bridges in a previously-held meeting between the district officials of Pithoragarh and Darchula. Ashish Chauhan, district magistrate, Pithoragarh, told TOI, “The Government of India has released Rs 46 crore for the construction of the motor bridge at Charchhum. Soon, the tender process for the same will be completed.” He added that the public works department officials of Dharchula (in India) will repair the suspension bridge leading to Nepal. DM Chauhan added that both sides agreed to conduct joint inspections along the Kali river to check unregulated cross-border movement. On the other hand, Nepalese officials -- who have the responsibility of constructing the Alagad suspension bridge over the Kali river -- informed the Indian side that they are in the process of awarding the contract for the project. The officials of the Himalayan nation also raised the issue of letting their country’s census workers use Indian routes to reach Tinker and Chhangru villages. These two Nepalese villages situated on the eastern side of the Kali river do not have direct connectivity with the Himalayan nation’s mainland, leaving only one option, Dharchula on the Indian side, to gain access to these villages. Responding to their query, Pithoragarh officials told them that the Uttarakhand state government and India’s ministry of external affairs have been intimated of the matter and a decision is awaited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/india-nepal-share-progress-on-construction-of-bridges-to-ease-cross-border-movement/articleshow/87954053.cms||Prem Punetha

---||Nagpur||‘Understand emotions, culture, reasons in a mythological story’||Nagpur: Shedding light on relevance of mythology in today’s world and how to interpret it, illustrator, speaker, author and mythologist Devdutt Pattanaik said that rather than being a judge, a reader must understand the emotions, the reasons and the culture mentioned in a mythological story. Pattanaik was speaking on the topic of ‘Insights from Mythology into Hinduism for Happiness,’ on Day 2 of the Orange City Literature Festival (OCLF) 2021, on Saturday. The seminar on mythology was conducted by Archana Sharma, a writer and translator. On importance of mythology in today’s world, Pattanaik said, “When we are born, we do not come with the knowledge or the purpose of life. The answer cannot be found through nature but culture. The knowledge of right and wrong, death and reincarnation, God or Evil, etc is something we have learned through stories that may or may not be entirely true, but these are the stories that unfold mythologies. So, inclusion of mythologies is essential.” On ways of interpreting mythologies, he said, “First of all, a reader should not become a judge or lawyer while reading something. Understanding the emotions, reasons behind the story and its culture is what one must look after. The right expressions needs to be understood and not whether it’s right or wrong. It must be the expressions and reasons behind the stories that hold value and mythology is something whose true interpretation is difficult to be found.” Talking about the scientific viewpoint, Pattanaik said, “The debate between religion and mythology is endless but now, in this scientific world, people believe that there are multiple beliefs when it comes to God, and even atheism is a part of these beliefs, which cannot be said to be right or wrong.” On his books, Pattanaik’s said that he writes with the sole purpose of educating his readers and talks about vast topics with the inclusion of ancient stories, thoughts and cultures. Arshia Murrian anchored the evening. OCLF also showcased Indian cultural talent at a programme ‘Classical Conclave’ held at South Central Zone Cultural Centre on Saturday evening. It had four major performances like singing by Sadhana Shiledar, instrumental display of Dilruba by Rushikesh Karmarkar, Kathak performance by Priyanka Abhyankar and the team, and Bharatanatyam by Shrimathy Madkholkar.

Fit out is a term used to describe the process of making interior spaces suitable for occupation. The data (see graphics), which was culled out of surveys in eight cities in India (Pune, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and the four metros, has shown that costs are spiralling upwards in the fit-out process in most aspects, especially in audio-visual facilities. JLL said most of the fit-out and office improvement investments by developers and business leaders are towards making offices sustainable, including planned water conservation facilities, as well as health and safety elements such as sensors and air filtration. “As most organizations open their offices for re-entry, we’re seeing a significant jump in pricing for office fit-outs. Material availability and disruption in the supply chain are predicted to be the biggest cost drivers for 2022. Increased competition and aggressive pricing of margins in cities such as Pune, where contractors are chasing reduced work, may offset some of these price hikes,” said MV Harish, executive managing director of JLL India’s project development services division.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/as-material-costs-rise-office-fit-outs-turn-dearer-report/articleshow/87954640.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Dehradun||Forest Research Institute bars tourists’ entry after IFS officers test Covid positive||Dehradun: Tourists won’t be allowed to enter the Forest Research Institute (FRI) till December 5. The decision comes almost a week after 11 senior Indian Forest Service (IFS) officers, who had gone for training at Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy (IGNFA), tested positive for Covid-19. During pre-Covid days, the FRI was visited by at least 500 visitors just to see the magnificent building and its sprawling green campus, while in the morning, over 100 people visited the area just for morning walk after buying the entry tickets. But the situation is back to square one now. Only the authorities, students and residents are being permitted inside the campus. Previously too, when Covid cases had surfaced, the FRI administration had decided to impose a lockdown as a precautionary measure. IGNFA is located on the FRI campus, where the officers are in isolation in the old hostel, while 37 others, who underwent training with the infected officers, have been kept in a separate building as they are all Covid negative.  Intensive testing and sanitisation are underway on the premises to ensure the virus doesn’t spread, officials said.  Meanwhile, the state government has also issued an advisory to all government and private health facilities to ensure that those travelling from abroad are tested for the virus and their samples are sent to Doon Medical College Hospital for getting genome testing done. So far, the new variant, B.1.1.529, has been found in Botswana, South Africa and Hong Kong.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/forest-research-institute-bars-tourists-entry-after-ifs-officers-test-covid-positive/articleshow/87954055.cms||Shivani Azad

Speaking to TOI, Pandey said that with the Nashik civic polls approaching, there is a possibility that some politicians may make use of anti-social elements for their political purposes. Police officials have been instructed to take strict action in such cases. “I have also instructed the police personnel to identify habitual criminals within their respective jurisdictions and continuously keep an eye on their activities. The police must also take strict preventive action against such criminals so that they do not indulge in illegal activities. Similar action should be taken against criminals who have recently come out of jails and those who are out on bail,” he added. The process to extern criminals who have two or more crimes registered against them has also been taken up, the police commissioner said. Pandey added that strict action, like registering offences, should be taken against people who are found putting up illegal hoardings or posters in the city, irrespective of which political party they belong to. All measures are being taken up to ensure that the 2022 civic polls take place in a peaceful manner, he said. 3 recent murders due to personal enmity: Pandey Meanwhile, regarding the murder of a BJP member in the Satpur area on Friday morning, Pandey said all the three murders that have taken place in the city over the past few days were due to personal enmity. PI Kishor More of the Satpur police station said Vinod Barve, the suspect arrested in the murder of Amol Ighe, the BJP president of the Satpur area, was produced before a city court on Saturday. The court remanded Barve in police custody till December 5. He said the initial interrogation revealed that Barve had set up an employees’ union in an industrial unit where Amol Ighe already had an union. The dispute between them over their unions led to Ighe’s murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/nashik-top-cop-orders-increased-vigil-on-politicians-parties-ahead-of-civic-polls/articleshow/87953500.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (PMRDA) had announced the appointed date — actual work commencement — of the elevated 23km Hinjewadi to Shivajinagar Metro corridor on Thursday. He said that all agencies should work to ensure that the project was completed within 40 months and the formal bhoomi puja will be conducted by the chief minister soon. “The traffic management plan is in place for the construction of the Pune University flyover. Once constructed, it would solve the problem of traffic congestion for the next 50 years,” the deputy CM said. The PMRDA, executing this Metro line, will develop it on the PPP (public-private partnership) model with Tata and Siemens, jointly executing the project. With a double deck flyover proposed, DCM has directed all agencies to work together and execute the work at the earliest. The Pune Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (Pumta) has approved two circular routes to start the construction work of the proposed multi-level Savitribai Phule Pune University flyover. It has suggested the closure of the roads for heavy vehicles near the proposed flyover between 10pm and 6am to ensure less traffic congestion. The Pumta’s suggestion included two circular routes proposed by the PMRDA. The first is from Senapati Bapat Chowk (Ganeshkhind Road) to Dhotre Path, Vitthalrao Tukaram Bhosle Chowk, and Senapati Bapat Road . The second is from University Chowk to Pashan Road, Abhimanshree Road, Baner Road and university. Officials said it would take 40 minutes to complete the end-to-end commute on the route, which comprises 23 stations. The project is estimated to cost a little over Rs8,000 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/agencies-directed-to-work-together-for-3rd-metro-line/articleshow/87954637.cms||---

Bengal BJP is likely to finalize its candidates’ list for the KMC elections by Sunday night after Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar holds a meeting of the campaign committee at the party’s Hastings office during the day. Bengal BJP leaders held two meetings for north and south Kolkata in presence of KMC election observer Jyotirmay Singh Mahato, IT cell head Amit Malviya, Rajya Sabha MP Swapan Dasgupta and BJP leaders Dinesh Trivedi and Pratap Bandyopadhyay. Speculation was rife about the absence of KMC election observer Arjun Singh and state vice-president Raju Banerjee. “Singh is in Goa to attend a relative’s wedding. Banerjee is also preoccupied with some family issues,” said a Bengal BJP leader. Neither Singh nor Banerjee could be contacted. “Both of them are out on work and I don’t think their presence was needed at the meeting today,” said Bengal BJP spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya. In the meeting, according to a source, Dasgupta said priority would be given to BJP karyakartas and old-timers. Some outgoing BJP coordinators, such as Meena Devi Purohit, are likely to get tickets. The party may field candidates who contested the assembly polls. “From around 5,000 applications, candidates for nearly 50 wards have been decided. Discussions were held for 50 more wards on Saturday and the rest of the seats will be decided on Sunday,” said a Bengal BJP leader. “Some leaders from other political parties also in touch with us. The list will be out soon,” Bhattacharya said. The party has assigned 12 MLAs to oversee the election work in 60 KMC wards, six wards for each MLA. Leaders and MLAs, such as Subrata Thakur, Agnimitra Paul, Ashok Kirtania, Ambika Roy, Rudranil Ghosh and Priyanka Tibrewal, might be roped in to assist election management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/arjun-raju-miss-bjp-poll-meeting/articleshow/87954633.cms||Rohit Khanna

The court said this after the bail plea of a man, who was accused in 49 narcotic drugs cases in the last 23 years but was either acquitted or his name was expunged from the case later on. Hearing a bail application filed by one Gaurav alias Gaura of Muzzafarnagar, who was accused in 49 narcotic drugs cases in the last 23 years but was either acquitted or his name was expunged from the case later on, Justice Vivek Kumar Singh observed, “This court fails to understand the working of the police of the concerned police station that how the cases said to have been wrongly imposed on a person that too not once, it happens repeatedly in the present case, it is not expected from the Uttar Pradesh Police. Such callous action can’t be imagined from officers of the disciplined force.” Expressing concern of the working of the police, it observed, “For a citizen the term ‘police’ is a sense of protection, relief, peace and tranquillity and under its auspices, he walks and sleeps fearlessly. However, if his protection shield finds pores, the belief is devastated. Police is one of the wings of disciplined forces which have been set up for the safety and security of the public at large.” As per the applicant, police personnel of Muzaffarnagar’s Khatauli police station have registered false and frivolous cases against him and in this regard a complaint was made by the applicant to Human Rights Commission, Delhi,whereupon an order was passed on June 5, 2007, directing the Prayagraj ADG to compensate the applicant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hc-summons-up-dgp-for-repeated-wrongful-confinement-of-man/articleshow/87956007.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

The elderly man, about 60 years of age, lodged a complaint with the Cyber police station on Friday. Senior police inspector with the Cyber police DS Hake said, “It’s a case of card swap. The elderly man retired from a private company and had parked some portion of his savings in the account.” The victim, according to the police, had gone to the ATM kiosk at BT Kawade Road to withdraw some cash but was faltering to withdraw it. At that moment, the suspect entered the ATM kiosk and told the complainant that he can help him withdraw the money. The elderly man handed him over the ATM debit card and also shared its PIN with him. Hake said, “After helping the elderly man with the cash withdrawal, the suspect kept back the card of the elderly man and handed him a similar-looking card.” “As the victim had provided the PIN to the suspect, he went on withdrawing cash from different ATMs using the PIN. Though the elderly man received text messages of the withdrawals , he had not checked his cell phone for three days. After reading the messages, he approached his bank and the police with his complaint,” Hake said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fraudster-swaps-atm-card-with-man-withdraws-rs-4-61l/articleshow/87954642.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Forest dept won’t allow business activity at Nahargarh Fort||JAIPUR: The forest department has written to the archaeological department not to carry out any activity inside Nahargarh Fort which is part of the reserve forest. The forest department’s stand was made clear when the archaeological department was planning to approach the Supreme Court against a National Green Tribunal (NGT) order to discontinue commercial activities in the fort. The NGT order was given on a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by environmentalist Rajendra Tiwari. A letter dated November 25 reads, “In the reserve forest the only activities, which are mentioned under the provisions of Forest Protection Act, 1980 and the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, will be allowed to be carried out after the forest department permission.” With the sword of eviction hanging heavy on private and government restaurants inside Nahargarh Fort, the popular light and sound show will be discontinued as Kesar Kyari Bagh is overlapping with the boundary of reserve forest and falling under the eco sensitive zone of the wildlife sanctuary. “For the compliance of NGT orders, a survey of Kesar Kyari Bagh was conducted by the forest department on November 2. The department will present facts to the high authorities,” said a forest source. After both the exercises — issuing of letter and carrying out a survey of forest land — the possibilities of archaeology department filing an appeal against the NGT orders in Supreme Court looks bleak. Following this on October 28, the archaeology department appointed an additional advocate general to file an appeal against the NGT order. The AAG had informed that the replies filed by both the departments earlier before the NGT were contradictory. This will be a major challenge in seeking relief. “As forest department cannot change or mild its stand as facts was already presented before the NGT, it will be a challenge for the archaeological department to firmly contest the case. So, far the archaeological department had not approached the Apex court,” added sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/forest-dept-wont-allow-biz-activity-at-nahargarh-fort/articleshow/87955133.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Cinematographer chronicles over 600 single screens in photographs||MUMBAI: One dark evening in Goa’s Agassaim village a few years ago, 53-year-old cinematographer Hemant Chaturvedi caused a minor hullabaloo when he entered an abandoned single-screen theatre in his perennial all-white kurta-pyjama. “I was mistaken for a ghost,” says Chaturvedi, recalling the only time he had scared others during his 32,000-km camera-toting journey across 11 Indian states during which he was kicked by a donkey, attacked by a Billy goat and given a “near-death experience” by a feisty Rottweiler. “I was even caned by a chowkidar in Pune,” brags Chaturvedi, who encountered bats, spiders, scorpions, pigeons, snakes, wasps, ants, cows and drug addicts on his oft-kurta-ripping, two-year-long quest to photograph and record the “tragic beauty” of the country’s endangered single-screen theatres. If all had gone well at Chaturvedi’s ninth visit to the Kumbh Mela in 2019, this ongoing “visual conservation” project—the subject of his recent talk at Fort’s Khaki Lab—would never have happened. Irritated at being cheated by a tent accommodation manager at the Mela, the cinematographer—who had quit the film industry in 2015 to do work that’s “self-initiated, self-motivated and self-financed”—had found himself killing time at his ancestral home in UP’s Prayagraj. On a stroll in the winter sun towards Allahabad University, he was taking pictures of the legendary science block building when a sense of deja vu loomed over him in the form of Lakshmi Talkies, a dilapidated, garbage-ridden single-screen from the 1930s. “The panwalla next to the theatre informed me that it was about to be demolished to make way for yet another faceless and characterless mall,” recalls Chaturvedi, who managed to have the theatre opened the next day. From the broken statue of goddess Lakshmi in the foyer to the hand-painted murals of scenes from the Ramayana on the auditorium walls, from the hand carved Art Deco bannisters to the projection window from another time, his hungry camera froze it all. After repeating this ritual at three more old theatres in Prayagraj, Chaturvedi heard his mind replaying the “pessimistic and real” conversations he had had with the owners and staff at the four structures. “I realised that it was only a matter of time before this glorious era of cinema exhibition became a myth to the subsequent generation,” says Chaturvedi. Intoxicated by the idea of “photo-documenting” single-screens, Chaturvedi meticulously planned his solo journey from Mamaji Talkies in Bhusawal to Narendra Talkies in Ujjain and from older theatres that had separate booking windows for women to smaller theatres to theatres with no windows. On these offbeat heritage jaunts , an elderly rickshawallah would serve as his guide. “Rickshawallas tend to know all the abandoned theatres,” says Chaturvedi. Amid the “deafening silences” of the bare-boned theatres, Chaturvedi found the “ghostly echo” of a once-teeming ecosystem of topis, skull caps, burqas and sarees jostling for tickets and whistling, dancing and sharing a gigantic space. If this enhanced the contrast of a multiplex experience where audiences shush each other, the toll of the pandemic on cinemas has accelerated the urgency of his project. “They’ve done everything they can to stay relevant,” says Chaturvedi. “The fault lies with government policies and distributors who charge single screen cinemas ridiculous amounts of money to screen newly released movies.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cinematographer-chronicles-over-600-single-screens-in-photographs/articleshow/87955151.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

Earlier, the vaccination certificates were necessary for visitors at a few key government offices only, which included the Aurangabad district collectorate and the Aurangabad municipal corporation (AMC). The taskforce has also announced that at least one medical officer will be present at the primary health centre (PHC), at all times, and focus on early morning and late evening vaccine administrations. The rural areas of the district continue to lag behind in terms of Covid vaccination, especially the second dose. As per the official data, in the rural areas, the first dose has been administered to 68% of the target beneficiaries as compared to 69% in the Aurangabad municipal limits. However, only 25% of the beneficiaries have taken the second dose in the rural areas, against 38% in the urban areas. Meena Shelke, the Aurangabad zilla parishad president, said, “The vaccination programme has been made more flexible and convenient. Considering the Covid-19 outbreak in other parts of the world, vaccination has become essential for the rural masses across the country.” Amid low vaccination numbers in the minority community-dominated areas, the taskforce has decided to authorize general practitioners from the Muslim community as vaccinators with proper protocol. They have also decided to involve more maulawis in the immunisation drive to vaccinate greater number of beneficiaries from the community. Also, the taskforce, headed by Aurangabad district collector, has decided to provide temporary incentives to the workforce involved in the execution of the ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ campaign within municipal areas for the next one month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/vax-certificate-to-be-verified-at-all-govt-offices-in-aurangabad/articleshow/87954654.cms||---

The tree has now fully revived and long sprouts can be seen on the top of the trunk. A five-year-old girl, Avya Borker Ray, who lives in the neighbourhood, has adopted the tree. Similarly, a sheesham tree, which was given a head back after it fell during a storm on September 1, has fresh sprouts. The mango tree was replanted by New Delhi Municipal Council and activists of Green Circle of Delhi after pruning the upper part and giving it a head back. To ensure proper revival, Ray, one of the youngest activists of the group, visited the tree on the road next to her school every day to see how it was faring. Suhas Borker, founder member of Green Circle of Delhi, said, “A tree can be saved by replanting it at the same spot without wasting any time. But it can also experience a transplant shock. This is why post-replanting care is vital for the survival of a tree uprooted by a storm.” “Seeing how the mango tree got a new life is good for the child’s education. People should come forward to adopt trees as we cannot depend only on the authorities to save the green lungs of the city,” added Borker. In a similar manner, the 60-feet-tall and around 70-year-old sheesham (Dalbergia sissoo) tree with a girth of 2.9 metres was also resurrected. This tree, which is just across the road from the mango tree, has now been given a head back and standing support. “The sheesham has got fresh sprouts and crossed the threshold for survival,” said Borker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mango-tree-gets-new-life-after-falling-during-storm/articleshow/87955154.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

As per the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily AQI bulletin that assessed the air quality of 153 cities all over India, Muzaffarnagar is the only city in the state to have recorded ‘severe’ levels of air pollution. Blaming it on drop in temperature and wind speed, Muzaffarnagar pollution department claimed that due to change in weather, the air quality deteriorated. Officials said local administration is taking several measures to loosen the smog by sprinkling water on roads and trees, and ensuring a complete ban on the construction activity and factories that emanate smoke." According to list of the districts published on the board's website on Friday at 4pm, the most polluted city was Siwan in Bihar with an AQI value of 426, followed by Faridabad and Muzaffarnagar (423) and Delhi (406). The board categorises air quality as 'poor' if the AQI value is between 200 and 299; 'very poor' if it is between 300-400; and 'severe' if the reading crosses 400. Also, the AQI value reflects the extent of the presence of PM 2.5 pollutants suspended in the air. Notably, data from all districts across the country is uploaded on the CPCB's website at 4pm every day and on Saturday, the AQI of Muzaffarnagar was recorded at 309, which still is in the 'poor’ category but due to mild wind movement, the air quality was a tad better. According to sources in the pollution department of Muzaffarnagar, on Saturday, around 7 water tankers were pressed into service to sprinkle water on footpaths of the city's road. Shops selling construction material were instructed to cover sand lying in the open, and smog guns were used. According to regional officer, pollution department, Muzaffarnagar, Ankit Singh, “Three teams have been formed to check pollution levels. A fine of Rs 90 lakh has been imposed on various factories and jaggery units so far.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/muzaffarnagar-most-polluted-city-in-up-2nd-with-worst-aqi-in-country/articleshow/87954098.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Kolkata||Look Back In Wonder: The Calcutta Boxwallahs’ Mellow Autumn||Calcutta, christened Kolkata as recently as 2001, was once the glittering imperial capital of Britain’s Indian Empire. Delhi’s political status was elevated in 1912 but arguably Calcutta’s glamour wasn’t tarnished. After London, Calcutta remained second city of the British Empire. The King-Emperor reigned while Westminster ruled the Raj via Calcutta-based Viceroy of India.  Foreign big industry, mainly headquartered in Calcutta, ran handsomely well. Competition was tame. Easy prosperity of major commerce in tea, jute, cotton, indigo, coal and more planted laidback British colonial management culture in Calcutta, a city boasting finest turf, polo, golf and highsociety clubs. Yes, life in Calcutta was good. A practical business problem arose. Manning companies with expatriates was a costly affair. Yet it was absolutely imperative for Britain to keep the Indian Empire’s commercial revenue base stable. The advent in Calcutta of Indian boxwallahs resolved the headache. Who, why or what were these quaintly named “natives”? Hobson-Jobson Anglo-Indian Dictionary described a boxwallah as “an itinerant pedlar who sells cutlery, nick-nacks and small wares of all kinds”. Of course, a Calcutta boxwallah was none of these! For an authentic answer there’s none better than senior-most surviving boxwallah Sukhendu Ray who happily turns 100 years on 29 November. Boxwallahs were elitist Indian gentlemen perfectly suited for employment in British companies and agency houses. Well educated, often in Britain, scions of upscale families too well-bred to be crassly money driven, inevitably these young men were keen sportsmen too. Yet, despite perfect credentials it wasn’t always easy for them to obtain jobs they sought. Ray was armed with chartered accountancy credentials earned in 1950 from England and Wales when he returned home to look for work. Over 70 years later, he admits it wasn’t easy. Many young men wanted “glamour and glory” of employment in a British business house. Cutting through clutter, as it were, Ray approached pucca British-owned engineering firm Guest Keen Williams (GKW) “through someone I knew and immediately got the job”. Sukhendu Ray, boxwallah, was born. He was destined to be burrah sahib of GKW in 1977. Ray’s near contemporary KSB Sanyal, 91, performed brilliantly as chairman of Andrew Yule Group during tenure in 1980s spilling on to 1991. Sanyal pulled the piteously loss-making conglomerate out of the red. More, profit was large enough to provide dividend. This feat was appreciated by then prime minister Indira Gandhi who graciously accepted the dividend cheque personally from Sanyal, his lifetime honour. An outgoing personality, matchless boxwallah Sanyal held three prized honorary public offices simultaneously in 1988—sheriff of Calcutta; president, Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry; president, Tollygunge Club. For a change, let’s come closer to the present by meeting an octogenarian after a centenarian and then a nonagenarian. Here we do touch upon Andrew Yule for a bit but that’s coincidental. Lad from Patna Asoke Dutt, now 83, was a gifted sportsman from late teenage. That’s early enough! Cricket topped his list of interests. Dutt played for Patna University in the national level Rohinton Baria Gold Trophy inter-university cricket tournament from 1957 to 1961 and during these years, also for Bihar for the Ranji Trophy. Mind you, he was only 18! Dutt’s haul of 6 wickets for 16 runs in the Bihar vs Orissa Ranji match in 1957 stands out among records. Not at all surprisingly, Asoke Dutt turned boxwallah in 1962 when he was handpicked as Senior Staff Probationer by Bengal Coal Company, premier corporate in Andrew Yule’s managing agency phalanx. He retired in 1998 as Executive Director of an important Andrew Yule Group company. Keeping alive a melange of social commitments true to boxwallah tradition, Dutt served three club tenures as president, Tollygunge Club; president, Calcutta Cricket and Football Club; managing member, Calcutta Club. Asoke Dutt is a true-blue boxwallah. Having said that, a wide swathe of consensus seems to have grown currently that boxwallahs’ days are numbered. The logic is simple. The boxwallah theorem stands on the axiom that employed gentry won’t move. Therefore unshakeable loyalty to one’s employer is permanent. Today, benefits of job-hopping are rising rapidly in an environment where uncertainty reigns supreme. Into future corporate ambitions are being factored opportunities that didn’t exist before. So no boxwallahs tomorrow, Q.E.D. Life moves on. NextGen guys will possibly find newbie Sukhendu Ray’s early crisis at work disgusting, not humorous. His first cocktail party invitation from GKW burrah sahib mentioned dress code as “black tie”. Ray didn’t have the right attire and there was barely time to get one done. He rushed in panic to a top Park Street clothier and pushed him to deliver it in three days flat. Sukhendu Ray began life at GKW in a tizzy. Upon retirement in 1983, the utterly content former boxwallah, Ray, adopted creativity as his mission. Strongly encouraged by wife Bharati, renowned academic and scholarly author, he translated works of Tagore and Saratchandra from Bengali to English. Not satisfied, Ray took up children’s classic Thakurmar Jhuli. He turned next to painting and sketching, learning techniques from YouTube. He’s at the easel every day. For music, he plays violin and flute. Sukhendu Ray urges each business whizkid who cares to listen, be honest to boxwallah virtues, don’t stop learning and fulfil all four seasons right up to your mellow autumn.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/look-back-in-wonder-the-calcutta-boxwallahs-mellow-autumn/articleshow/87954664.cms||---

The health department is making efforts to detect cases early by conducting contact tracing of all those who were in touch with an infected person. As many as 26 persons tested positive for Covid in the state on Saturday taking the overall tally to 9,54,741. The state’s casualty count stands at 8,955. “We have done data analysis of Covid infections and found that 48 per cent were found infected during contact tracing. Our teams are conducting contact tracing efficiently. At least 19 persons in contact of every Covid person are being traced. In the tracing, we have found a lot of persons infected. Efficient contact tracing is helping us in diagnosing cases early and timely treatment,”said Vaibhav Galriya, secretary (health). Jaipur is also witnessing a spike in cases. Health department’s rapid response teams have been deployed for contact tracing. “We have found four persons in a family infected with Covid recently. Contact tracing is helping us in preventing spread of the virus as well,” said Dr Narrottam Sharma, chief medical health officer (Jaipur I). The city reported 11 cases, out of those four were found in Mansarovar, while two were reported from Vaishali Nagar and one case each was reported from Ajmer Road, Civil Lines, Gandhi Nagar, Sanganer and Sodala. “Out of those, two were schoolchildren.

---||Mumbai||‘Compliance fatigue’ symptoms showing at single halls near you||MUMBAI: Inside a single-screen in a prominent Vidarbha town on November 20, an unintentional statutory warning played out before the matinee show of a Hindi comedy film. It began when an “educated” duo purchased Rs-100 tickets for the ‘box’, the seating area next to the balcony. While one of them sat in a chair, the other decided to perch himself on the baton that had been affixed with nails on to the adjacent seat. Soon, yelps “for compensation for bad seats” emanated from deep within him as a nail meant to hammer home the 50 per cent rule, hit the patron where it hurts. Even as the injury was “medically attended” to and two free cups of chai were given to the duo, the manager politely asked the man in pain why he had chosen to sit on the prohibited seat. “There is no such restriction at home,” came the reply. “We always sit together to watch TV shows and movies.” Call it the blooper reel of the new normal or the side-effects of “compliance fatigue”— the new phrase that encapsulates the public’s growing tiredness with social distancing norms—but many unprecedented scenes are unfolding between the seats of dying cinemas in the face of pandemic-induced guidelines. While some owners and managers of Maharashtra’s ghostly single-screens confide openly about these SOP transgressions that range from unmasking while watching to sneaking in food, others demand anonymity for fear of consequences. In March this year, an exhibitor in Malegaon was baffled to find his license suspended after a video clip of the massive crowd that jumped over the gates to enter his single-screen that was showing the action film ‘Mumbai Saga’, did the rounds of social media. By now, some small-town theatres are used to this straight-from-the-’80s sight of jostling crowds that unfolds in the wake of every reopening that follows a long shutdown and makes their managers nostalgic about the flush times when their cleaning staff took home coins thrown at the screen by the kilo. Social distancing, these seasoned exhibitors know, is not in the nature of their daily-grind-weary, entertainment-hungry customers. Grateful for the return of the masses, some managers have instructed the staff to stay quiet when patrons ask at thermal gunpoint: “Why are you checking our temperature? Are we sick?” Some customers have even chastised staff members whom SOPs prohibit from selling refreshments in the premises. Demands for proof of double-vaccinated status are taken as an affront. “Even if they are fully vaccinated, some customers don’t want to show the certificate,” says Lokendra Jain, president of Central Circuit Cine Association which spans theatres in Khandesh and Vidarbha to MP, Rajasthan and Chattisgarh. Jain recalls how on the first day, first show of ‘Sooryavanshi’ on November 5, a single screen in Amravati dispensed apologies and cash in place of tickets. “The management’s oversight had led to overbooking,” says Jain. “They had sold online tickets for 70 per cent capacity instead of the prescribed 50 per cent,” reveals Jain, adding that some of the miffed customers were given a refund while others were “adjusted” in the subsequent shows. Already weighed down by heavy electricity bills, taxes and the fresh economic ravages of the lockdown, single screen managers can't help but see an auditorium half-full as a glass half-empty. "If restaurants are working in full capacity and journeys in buses, trains and planes are being allowed, why are theatres being asked to function at half capacity?" asks Jain, admitting that he makes “exceptions” for large families. “I let them sit together,” he says. Surely, at least one gatekeeper in a single-screen in the North East can empathize with Jain. Soon after the first Covid wave ebbed and this North East cinema hall had reopened during Diwali of 2020, the gatekeeper had apparently heard a husband tell his wife who was sitting one seat away: “Wait till the lights go off”. “When the lights came on during the interval,” a single-screen manager tells us, “the wife was found sitting on the husband’s lap.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/compliance-fatigue-symptoms-showing-at-single-halls-near-you/articleshow/87955162.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

A resident of Faridpur area of Bareilly, Taimur had enrolled for an MBA programme but never completed it as he took to drug smuggling. Following the footsteps of his uncle, Shaheed Khan, a drug mafioso in the area who is behind bars now, Taimur learnt how to make heroin and formed his own gang. A week ago, Shaheed’s assets valued at Rs 50 crore were seized under the provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) Act. Rajkumar Agarwal, additional SP (rural), told TOI that Taimur and his men are responsible for luring several young men into drug smuggling, many of whom are in jail today. “After gathering information, we found that Taimur had purchased several properties in Bareilly and neighbouring districts from the money earned through smuggling. We have identified his properties in Bareilly and the district magistrate has approved their seizure.” According to Bareilly police, this year, more than 70 people have been arrested in the district for their alleged involvement in the manufacture and supply of drugs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/bareilly-drug-smuggler-taimurs-assets-worth-over-rs-13-cr-to-be-seized/articleshow/87954101.cms||---
---||Mysuru||Event management firm accused of conducting Marathon in reserve forest||Chikkamagaluru: A private event management company said to belong to the son of an influential person allegedly conducted a marathon with nearly 500 participants inside the reserve forest of Ettinabhuja range in Mudigere taluk on Saturday. Environment activists are upset and are demanding legal action against them for trespassing the forest areas. The event management firm is active on social media and promoted the event for the last 15 days online after which 500 participants were selected for the marathon. Villagers were shocked to see several vehicles parked on the roadside late on Friday. Environmentalists tried to get information from forest officials but in vain. They were told that foresters hadn’t given permission to any event management firm. Angered by the forest department’s reckless reply, green activist from Mudigere, Karthik Aditya Belgodu took the issue to the Mudigere taluk administration. He only got simple replies from officials who tried to downplay the issue. Karthik Aditya told STOI, “Usually any event management company informs senior officers in the forest department before entering reserved areas. They may have taken permission from higher-ups as the organizing firm’s proprietor is influential.” “When 500 people enter a pristine forest, we cannot imagine the impact on the ecosystem. What was the necessity to conduct the marathon inside the protected area?” he said. Every participant was charged Rs 3,500, he claimed. “Nowadays many event management companies are invading Malnad forests, especially in Chikkamagaluru. If a common nature enthusiast asks for trekking permission, the forest department denies but they allow influential people. This practice must be stopped,” said an environmentalist Ajay Kumar Sharma. Chikkamagaluru deputy commissioner KN Ramesh told TOI that the district administration were not informed about the event. “Information is being gathered to take necessary action. We are not giving any permission. The forest department must regulate the activities inside the forest areas,” he said. Deputy conservator of forest of Mudigere division Kranti said, “We have not given them permission to enter the forest areas. According to information we got, they conducted an awareness drive on the road and returned.” PIC: ChikkamagaluruEttinabuja 1: Ettinabhuja hill view, pic posted by event management company on Facebook ChikkamagaluruEttinabuja 2: Marathon started at Byrapura village beneath the hills on Saturday morning ChikkamagaluruEttinabuja 3: Hundreds of participants at the Marathon||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/event-management-firm-accused-of-conducting-marathon-in-reserve-forest/articleshow/87954014.cms||---

The exhibition is organised by Surat Jewellery Manufacturers’ Association (SJMA) and Surat Jewel Tech Foundation was launched by Union MoS for textile and railway, Darshana Jardosh. The B2B exhibition will not allow any retail jewellery buyers. “We are trying to create a B2B platform for jewellery manufacturers of the city. The city is now becoming a major jewellery making centre with global reach,” said Jayanti Savaliya, president of SJMA. “Earlier, Surat imported rough, polished it and exported finished diamonds to jewellery-making centres. Then it again imported diamond jewellery, which was a costly chain. Now, we are in position to manufacture jewellery of international standards using locally manufactured diamonds,” Savaliya added. “This is the first such exhibition exclusively meant for diamond jewellery manufacturers. Surat is fast becoming a major hub of diamond jewellery manufacturing and this event will help us promote our local industry,” said Amit Korat, vice-president, SJMA.

Body of Nilesh Sondarva, a resident of Kotda Sangani, was found under the overbridge of a national highway on Tuesday. The Shapar Veraval police found an injury mark on Sondarva’s body and a postmortem report confirmed that he died of injuries after being hit by a metal object. On scanning the cameras installed on the road, cops saw three people throwing a dead body from the bridge. The three were travelling in an autorickshaw. On watching the footage, the family members of the deceased identified two of the three accused as Chirag Joshi and Jignesh Koli, both residents of Balagam of Keshod taluka. On investigation it came to light that Bharat Sarman, a resident of Probandar, was the mastermind of the crime. Through its informers’ network police came to know that Sarman and Chirag Joshi were hiding in Hyderabad. A team went to Hyderabad and arrested the two. Two more accused Sohil Jalvani and Jignesh Vadhiya are still at large. Rajkot superintendent of police Balram Meena told reporters that the murder was fallout of an old rivalry. “Around five years back, Sarman used to often travel to Keshod to meet his lover. During one of the visits, Sondarva and his friends had thrashed him. On Monday night when Sarman came to Shapar Veraval to meet his friend Joshi he saw Sondarva and decided to kill him,” Meena said. The four accused kidnapped Sondarva in an autorickshaw owned by Joshi and took him near Pardi crossing. Later, they beat him to death with a pipe and then dumped the body at the bridge, cops said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/man-killed-over-old-rivalry-2-held/articleshow/87954030.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Post pandemic break, winter bird count back in Delhi-NCR to take stock of species||NEW DELHI: The birding community of Delhi-NCR will come together on Sunday after two years to hold an early winter bird count across different wetlands of the region in a bid to assess species density and how well have the migrants have settled here. The voluntary annual exercise that assesses avifauna of the region was not held last year in the wake of Covid-19. In 2019, during the last count, over 110 birders in 15 teams reported 256 species of both breeding residents and migrant terrestrial and water birds. The coordinators of the event named ‘Delhi winter bird count’ said that this time, over 20 teams of size varying from five members to 29 members would be heading to different locations across the region. “We are aiming at different areas of the region that include parts of Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida, Greater Noida and other parts of Haryana as well. The aim is to count and assess the species density, which we further upload on e-bird. The main aim this year is to encourage birding, so we are accompanying several new birders this year,” said Pankaj Gupta, a Delhi-based birder. He further pointed out that the event was “a count and not a census”. “We are not going with a grid map to count the numbers, rather we will be looking at the species diversity. This data will be useful in long terms, to assess when and how the diversity had been affected and what were the plausible parameters behind it,” he added. According to Gurgaon-based birder K B Singh, the count also tries to find how well the winter migrants have started to arrive. “They are almost here in different habitats in Delhi and NCR. We can see a number of ducks, including Common Teal, Gadwalls, Northern Pintails, Pochard, Tufted Ducks. There is also good sighting of migratory raptors like Marsh Harrier and Peregrine Falcon, and the passage migrants like Hobby. The count will reveal better how well the diversity is spotted across different habitats of the region,” said Singh. Recalling the previous event held in 2019, Noida-based birder Jaswinder Singh Waraich asserted his excitement of a notable sighting this year as well. “In 2019, Black eagle, Laggar falcon, Eurasian skylark, White-crowned penduline tit, Tawny eagle were among notable sightings,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/post-pandemic-break-winter-bird-count-back-to-take-stock-of-species/articleshow/87955200.cms||Kushagra Dixit

---||India||VP Singh’s hand wasn’t forced, says new book||NEW DELHI: Detractors have long held that Vishwanath Pratap Singh’s August 1990 announcement enforcing 27% OBC quota on central government jobs was a hasty political decision to retain the support of party MPs after deputy PM Devi Lal quit the government. But a new book reveals that Singh had, in fact, begun the groundwork for acceptance of the Mandal commission report within weeks of taking charge. Singh was sworn in as PM in December 1989, and immediately took preliminary steps including announcing an ‘action plan’ on December 25, 1989 and setting up a committee chaired by Devi Lal to oversee the process. He also directed the social welfare ministry to match the Mandal report’s list of OBC castes for each state with the lists already in use by many of them, to iron out anomalies. In this he was aided by the then social welfare minister Ram Vilas Paswan and secretary PS Krishnan. Krishnan is quoted as saying, “On taking over in January 1990, I prepared an agenda of things to get done, among which implementing the Mandal report was foremost,’ he said. ‘I knew, given the nature of the government, that it would not last long. So, there was no time to lose.’ He submitted a note on the Mandal report to the cabinet on 1 May 1990, placing it in historical and legislative perspective, pointing out that enforcing it needed no parliamentary approval but a mere executive order. Other senior bureaucrats, who had to acquiesce before it reached the cabinet, raised objections, but Krishnan rebutted all their arguments. ‘Cabinet Secretary Vinod Pande told me, “We have to find a way out of the Mandal problem for VP Singh,”’ he said. ‘I said, “Problem? That’s not what he told me. VP Singh wants to enforce Mandal.” Krishnan’s claims are part of a new book ‘The Disruptor: How Vishwanath Pratap Singh Shook India’ by journalist Debashish Mukerji. Krishnan was a strong advocate of social justice legislation and later served on the national commission of backward classes. The rush of events at the time did, however, see OBC leaders like Lalu Prasad and others push Singh and the Mandal announcement was certainly a big and unexpected surprise. Singh’s detractors had termed the step as political, taken solely due to Singh’s differences with Devi Lal. For instance, Sharad Yadav, then minister for textiles and food processing in Singh’s cabinet, says the PM’s hand was forced. “We were both committed to the Mandal Commission report, but VP Singh was not too enthusiastic about implementing it immediately,’ Yadav added. ‘I told him, “If you want the Lok Dal [B] MPs to stay with you, you have no choice. You either bring it in or we go with Devi Lal (deputy PM who had quit following differences with Singh).” Gardan pakad ke karwaya unsey (I held him [figuratively] by the neck and got him to do it).’ It is another matter that the strategy failed, and V P Singh’s government fell three months later, in November 1990. The frenzied agitation against the Mandal report led to a complete metamorphosis of Singh’s image among the urban—and largely upper-caste—middle classes, who had once been his loudest supporters; he was now reviled for starting a caste war for political gain. ‘After Mandal, it was as if I was a different person,’ he said later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/vp-singhs-hand-wasnt-forced-says-new-book/articleshow/87956024.cms||Himanshi Dhawan

The survivor’s family alleged that they faced great difficulty in even registering an FIR in the matter, which was registered only after the intervention of an ADG-rank official. Even after the FIR was filed, progress in the case was slow. The woman’s brother complained to the anti-corruption department that the SI assigned to their case, Shokendra Kumar, was delaying the probe and asking for money to go ahead. A team from the anti-corruption cell in Moradabad laid a trap and caught Kumar while accepting the money in a busy market in Suar. The SI was suspended by Rampur SP Ankit Mittal. The rape survivor’s brother said, “First we had to face great difficulty in getting the FIR registered in my sister’s case. We had to approach the ADG Avinash Chandra. Then the SI who was assigned the case was not taking the investigation seriously. When I questioned him about it, he demanded Rs 20,000 as bribe. I am happy that swift action has been taken on our complaint.” Anju Bhadauria, in-charge, anti-corruption unit, Moradabad, said, “We found that the SI had not even produced the survivor in court for recording her statement under section 164 of CrPC. We have registered an FIR against him at Civil Lines police station in Rampur and are questioning him.” Additional SP Sansaar Singh added, “A departmental enquiry has been initiated against the official. We will transfer the case to some other officer and ensure the probe is completed soon.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Three attempt to smuggle Rs 3 crore in foreign cash, held||MUMBAI/BENGALURU: The Directorate Revenue of Intelligence (DRI) has arrested three people who were allegedly trying to smuggle foreign currency worth Rs 3.67 crore to Sharjah. The accused are Roshan Shamsunder Ghadi (31), Waseem Azeem Solkar (31) and Harish Vilas Raut (38). A probe that began after foreign notes worth Rs 1 crore hidden in a mixer were detected at Kempegowda International Airport on October 1 has led to this seizure. On October 1, two men from Tamil Nadu, who were to take a flight to Dubai were apprehended at KIA after they attempted to smuggle a white mixer. Most of its internal parts were removed and it was packed with US dollars, UAE dirhams and Saudi riyals. In the Mumbai case, Ghadi and Solkar were to fly to Sharjah by Air Arabia. They were detained and an examination of their baggage resulted in recovery of US dollars and Saudi riyals equivalent to Rs 3.70 crore. The two accused were arrested. During interrogation, they disclosed that Nitesh Varadkar had offered them Rs 35,000 to carry the bags along with free travel tickets and shopping in Sharjah. Ghadi also said that he had in the past carried similar bags to Dubai and Sharjah on four different occasions. Varadkar had sent Harish Raut the bags containing the currency. Based on the mobile number the officials arrested Vilas Raut , a resident of Jogeshwari. Officials said that the currency was concealed deep in ingeniously designed false bottoms of the carry-on luggage. “The accused failed to produce any supporting documents for carrying so much cash and hence the cash was seized under section 110 of the Customs act 1962. Besides the smuggling in terms of customs at, illicit export of foreign currency provides a means for laundering proceeds of the unlawful and criminal activities and it is a threat to national academy and national security,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-attempt-to-smuggle-rs-3cr-in-foreign-cash-held/articleshow/87955191.cms||Ahmed Ali

The department has deployed the German Shepherd on the lines of Bandipur Tiger Reserve, in order to help protect wildlife from poachers. Jhansi will be engaged in protecting wildlife, prevent timber smuggling and anti-poaching duties. The forest department introduced Jhansi to the tiger reserve, after she underwent seven months of rigorous training in Chandigarh, with the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP). Deputy conservator of forest and BRT Tiger Reserve project director G Santhoshkumar said the forest department had deployed Jhansi following the support and the help rendered by TRAFFIC India, a part of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), as sniffer dogs help check forest crimes. Forest guard Basavaraj and watcher Siddaramanna were trained to handle Jhansi, and they are taking care of her. The dog follows their instructions. The department will deploy Jhansi at Punajanur Range of the division. Jhansi will be trained to handle wildlife cases. Rana, a German Shepherd, was deployed by the forest department in Bandipur Tiger Reserve, and was instrumental in solving several important forest crimes since 2015, and hence the BRT Tiger Reserve decided to deploy Jhansi. Rana is on the verge of retirement, and will be replaced by Mudhol Hound Margaret aka Margi. Margi has learnt crime-fighting techniques from Rana, said a forest department source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/sniffer-dog-deployed-at-biligiri-ranganathaswamy-temple-tiger-reserve/articleshow/87954113.cms||---

As per official data, of the total 92,266 staffers from Maharashtra, 74,176 did not report to work, which continues to affect bus services, especially in Marathwada. A total of 18,090 staffers were discharging their duties on Saturday, which resulted in operations of 937 buses across Maharashtra till 5 pm on Saturday. MSRTC spokesperson said there was a gradual rise in the number of employees rejoining work. “As compared to Friday, around 7,000 more employees have joined work today (Saturday). We hope that all remaining employees will also resume their duties following a revised pay hike of 41% offered by the government,” the spokesperson said. Meanwhile, the Gazetted Officers’ Forum of Maharashtra has appealed to MSRTC employees to withdraw their strike. “The agitating workforce should not stretch things till it breaks. The ongoing extended agitation is causing hardship to rural masses and therefore there is fear that the agitating employees will lose the public sympathy,” said G D Kulthe, the chief advisor of the forum.He said the revised offer given by the state government in the form of up to a 41% pay hike is a win for the MSRTC employees, who have collectively waged the strike under the leadership of 28 different associations of State Transportation workers. “Our forum has vast experience of leading agitation of government employees for different demands in past. Citing such experience, I would like to advise that the option of backing out at a certain stage after getting partial success is always a wise decision in the interest of all stakeholders,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/more-than-80-st-employees-skip-work/articleshow/87953580.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Coimbatore||Elephant deaths: Loco pilots booked||Coimbatore: The forest department on Saturday registered a case against the loco pilot and the assistant loco pilot of the Mangalore-Chennai Express that mowed down three wild elephants at Navakkarai here on Friday night.Loco pilot M T Subair, 54 and assistant loco pilot M C Akhil, 31, were booked under Section 9 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. While Subair has 28 years of experience, Akhil has six years of experience, railway sources said.The pilots, who were taken to Coimbatore for questioning, were released later. “We released the loco pilots after recording their statements and taking undertakings for cooperation in the investigation,” said principal chief conservator of forests Shekhar Kumar Niraj.District forest officer T K Ashok Kumar said the train dragged a 25-year-old female elephant, which was pregnant, for more than 140 metres. “A 15-year-old tuskless male and a six-year-old female elephant were found dead near the track. The carcasses were shifted to the reserve forest using a crane. They were buried in the forest after a team led by forest veterinary officer A Sukumar conducted postmortem,” he said.Meanwhile, tension ensued when the railway protection force (RPF) detained five officials of the Coimbatore forest division, who reached the Palakkad railway station to retrieve data from the train’s microprocessor-based energy-cum-speed recording unit. They were released after intervention of senior police officers. Subsequently, members of some political outfits led by Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam (TPDK) staged a protest near Kerala Samajam at Gandhipuram on Saturday night, condemning the RPF.Elaborating on the incident, Shekhar said a team sent to Palakkad to collect evidence was illegally detained by RPF. “They recovered a microchip from the locomotive to retrieve speed data. It was later handed over to RPF.”“I have sought the help of the inspector general of forests, project elephant and ministry of environment, forest and climate change to check elephant deaths in the region,” Shekhar added. Members of the All-India Loco Running Staff Association raised slogans against the Coimbatore forest department at the Palakkad railway junction for detaining the loco pilots. “A forest department team from Coimbatore illegally entered the locomotive and removed a microchip. It is an offence under the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966. When they were detained for questioning, the team handed over the chip to us. After the forest department released the pilots, we also released the forest department staff,” a railway official said.“The loco pilots had operated the train under the speed limit of 42kmph on the stretch when it hit the elephants. The fixed speed limit on the stretch is 45kmph,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/elephant-deaths-loco-pilots-booked/articleshow/87954687.cms||A Subburaj

---||Kochi||Row over ‘Halal’ hollow, part of Sangh Parivar move: Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan||KOCHI: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday made his stand clear on the Halal controversy and said that the controversy was hollow, and it was part of a Sangh Parivar campaign. Vijayan said that it was only after it became an issue that even those who created the recent controversy over Halal realized its hollowness. “It (Halal) only means that it is okay for consumption and that it has no problems. That word is accepted in that sense. But now, several allegations connected with it are being raised to insult a particular community. Sangh Parivar is trying to create a particular division through this. This is done across the country, and we are seeing some acts as part of it in our Kerala too,” he said. The chief minister was addressing the CPM area committee meeting in Pinarayi on Saturday. He alleged that clashes are being created across the country in the name of cow slaughter and there was a trend of minorities getting attacked. He said that new controversies are coming up in Kerala too as a part of the same. Vijayan said that an article written by MP John Brittas in Deshabhimani, the CPM mouthpiece, says that even food given in Parliament had halal written on it. CM said that minorities are getting attacked and those who fight for democracy are being hunted down in the country. “In this way, by deviating from the modern democratic perspectives, Sangh Parivar is trying to propagate Hindutva politics,” the CM alleged. He said that BJP government is being controlled by RSS and as part of it, extreme-Hindutva is being implemented in the country as a policy itself. This is seriously affecting the life of the people in the country, he said. “Central government is taking a stand that is destroying Constitutional values. Secularism, federalism, and corruption-free politics are all being destroyed. The governance of the county is being done at the whims of corporates,” Vijayan said. He said that the activities that are going on now are to subjugate the vibrant culture of India to Hindutva agenda. “The BJP government can’t even recognize the secularism envisaged by the Constitution. The Citizenship Amendment Act was brought based on this approach. Sangh Parivar stands for alienating the Muslim community from the Indian society,” the CM said. The CM added that Congress and BJP have the same policy and that a clear stand was needed to eradicate communalism. He added that the Left could do this, and it needs to progress together with other democratic forces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/row-over-halal-hollow-part-of-sangh-parivar-move-cm/articleshow/87954723.cms||---

The woman had gone missing on Tuesday from Govandi and her body was found the next evening on the terrace of a vacant 13-storey residential building near Kohinoor Hospital in Kurla (West). Her postmortem report confirmed sexual assault, strangulation and serious head injuries. Rehan (21), alleged to be the woman's boyfriend, and his friend, Faisal (20), both also residents of Govandi, were arrested late on Saturday after investigations suggested their alleged involvement. Prima facie, it appears that Rehan, a first-year BCom student, was not keen on marrying her, said the Vinobha Bhave Nagar police. Allegedly tired of her "pestering", Rehan roped in Faisal to do away with her. Boys in Kurla bldg to shoot video found woman’s bodyTwo men were arrested on Saturday on charges of raping a 24-year-old woman and murdering her. On November 23, the duo took her to a Kurla building terrace on the pretext of sorting out her wedding issue and killed her. A group of boys who had gone to the building’s terrace to shoot a video spotted the body and alerted the police the next day, on November 24. The police said the woman had suffered serious head injuries which suggest she may have struggled. They had circulated photographs of the deceased in the neighbouring areas. Late on Saturday, police identified the deceased as a Govandi resident. A police officer went to her residence to inform her family and recorded her mother’s statement. Her mother told police that she had left home for some work on November 23 and did not return. On November 24, the family lodged a missing person complaint with the Govandi police. Based on the report, V B Nagar police identified the deceased. On Friday morning, the post-mortem report confirmed that she was sexually assaulted and murdered. The police who had initially registered a murder case under the Indian Penal Code accordingly added sections for rape. Deputy commissioner of police Pranay Ashok said, “Some boys had gone to the vacant building to shoot a video on Wednesday evening. When they reached there, they found the body covered in blood and informed the police.” Prima facie police suspect the killers may have lured the deceased to the terrace. Reacting to the crime, Maharashtra BJP vice-president Chitra Kishore Wagh said, “Mumbai, once known for the safety of women, is now on the path of ‘jungle raj’. Like the potholes of Mumbai, the law-and-order situation here also seems to have gone to the pits. Why does the government care more about Mumbai’s nightlife than women’s safety?” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-boys-in-kurla-bldg-to-shoot-video-found-womans-body/articleshow/87955213.cms||Ahmed Ali

As there were no other nominations filed anywhere, the returning officers declared the YSRC candidates elected unopposed. Election notification was issued to fill the vacancies from the local bodies representing two each from Guntur, Krishna and Visakhapatnam districts and one each from Vizianagaram, East Godavari, Prakasam, Chittoor and Ananthapur districts, all vacated by the TDP. However, the TDP could not win the required numbers in any of the local bodies in any of these districts as the ruling party wrested them all early this year. YSRC candidates, Varudu Kalyani and Vamsi Krishna Yadav from Visakhapatnam, Talasila Raghuram and Mondithoka Arun Kumar from Krishna, Ummareddi Venkateswarlu and Murugudu Hanumantha Rao from Guntur district, Indukuru Raghu Raju from Vizianagaram, Anantha Udaya Bhaskar from East Godavari, K J R Bharat from Chittoor and Thumati Madhava Rao from Prakasam district were declared elected unopposed. With the election of these 11 candidates from the local bodies, the strength of the ruling YSRC has gone to 32 in the 58-member Upper House. MLC Karimuneesa died of cardiac arrest recently. The seat, if filled now, would add to party’s strength. Once this vacancy is filled, the Legislative Council would have to wait till March 2023 for the next election to be held for the teachers and graduates’ constituencies, besides the Assembly quota, where the TDP has no strength to elect its members. These seats are currently held by the Progressive Democratic Front. Interestingly, the Opposition TDP would be completely wiped out from the Upper House in May 2023, unless it wins any of the local body elections, which are also held by the ruling YSRC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ruling-party-wins-all-11-mlc-seats-unopposed/articleshow/87954153.cms||Gopi Dara

He was speaking at the valedictory meet of Kerala’s largest entrepreneurship meet, TiEcon Kerala 2021. “Government has the definite role in developing basic hard infrastructure that facilitates and accelerates economic growth including overseeing the development of soft infrastructure to improve quality of life. This is still a job simple to describe but hard to do, and the administrative skill lies in doing it,” Thiaga Rajan said. “So far as entrepreneurship is concerned, we should bear in mind that the role of government is limited to building the right ecosystem for excellence and encourage professionalism, ensure ease of doing business, reduce complexity and unnecessary regulations, without compromising standards and environmental benchmarks, and then get out of the way. We also have to provide a safety net - some compassionate hands for those entrepreneurs who go through difficulties,” he said. Thiaga Rajan said government has also a role to play as the first buyer of all brilliant technologies that government needs, which will naturally encourage entrepreneurship and innovative ideas. “It is also imperative that new avenues and projects that generate revenue need to be identified in rural and urban areas. Human resources idling in many redundant government departments can be effectively shifted to activate, coordinate, guide and develop these identified sectors which generate employment and income. It is high time we carried out expenditure switching especially with respect to the less-utilized or unutilized manpower in many departments,” he said. Industries minister P Rajeeve had earlier announced a slew of legislative and infrastructure reforms in the TieCon meet to facilitate ease of doing business and ensure resilient and sustainable Industrial development.

---||Coimbatore||Slowly but steadily, Kothavadi lake regaining lost glory||Coimbatore: The sprawling Kothavadi lake in Kinathukadavu taluk is half-full after a gap of 20 years, thanks to the efforts of local farmers, elected representatives and government officials.The 150-acre lake had turned bone-dry after water from Thirumoorthy hill, which was its primary source, was cut off. A year ago, locals and activists joined hands to form Kothavadi lake restoration committee to restore its bund. When they launched weekly drives, a private firm pitched in with Rs 85 lakh from its corporate social responsibility fund.Water from the Parambikulam-Aliyar project channel was released into the lake 15 days ago. “It is a dream come true for villagers. As rain has been predicted for a few more days, water will be released into the lake. We are confident that the lake will be filled to the brim in another 10 days. It will benefit a large number of farmers in villages around the water body. Restoration of the lake is a fine example of the success that can be attained through joint effort,” a member of the committee said.Confident that water will last for six months, the villagers released 10,000 catla fingerlings, bought from the Aliyar Fish Farm, into the lake. Fish will keep water clean and create a vibrant lake ecosystem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/slowly-but-steadily-kothavadi-lake-regaining-lost-glory/articleshow/87954705.cms||V Devanathan

Although the veterinary doctors failed to confirm the exact cause of death, forest officials suspect it to be a case of death in territorial fight with other feline. The forest guard of Karva forest beat, during a routine patrolling, discovered the carcass of tigress in compartment no. 500 in the morning. A team led by RFO Santosh Thipe reached the spot and investigated the scene. The body was nearly four days old and in highly decomposed condition. The carcass was removed for postmortem after inquest formalities. RFO Thipe said that the feline was nearly six years old. He ruled out poaching saying that all the body parts of animal were intact. Veterinary officer, Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve, Dr Kundan Podchelwar and Livestock development officer, Dr Vikas Tajne carried out postmortem, but cause of death remained inconclusive due to highly decomposed condition of carcass. They have collected viscera samples for forensic tests to confirm the cause of death. Foresters strongly suspects it as a case of territorial fight. The fact that the neck of the tigress was broken and its nails on the hind legs too were found broken, corroborates with the chances of territorial fight among the tigresses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tigress-found-dead-in-ballarpur/articleshow/87952556.cms||Mazhar Ali

The deceased is yet to be identified as the body was mutilated. According to Gudivada One-Town circle inspector Govindarajulu, the incident came to light in the morning when labourers who returned to work after a few weeks’ break went to the penthouse and found the decomposed body. On information, police reached the spot and examined the scene. Cops said it was hard to even ascertain the age of the deceased. They suspect the death happened at least a month ago, as the body was putrefied beyond recognition. Police said an open post-mortem was conducted at the spot itself as it was not possible to shift the remains to a hospital. A case under section 174 of CrPC (suspicious death) is registered in Gudivada One-Town police station.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Doctors, vaccine trial participants opt for third dose privately||MUMBAI: Fear of exposure to Covid-19 virus is driving health care workers and even some vaccine trial participants (who got vaccinated in September-October last year), mainly from the vulnerable groups, to opt for the third dose privately. Private organisations are extending their vaccination drive for third doses without providing a certificate. Meanwhile, the government is likely to come out with its policy on additional dose in the coming week for people with predefined conditions. However, their primary objective will still be to immunise the 10-12 crores who remain unvaccinated. Retired medical teacher and an advisor to NGOs, Dr Suresh Sundar, said he had volunteered for the Covishield vaccine trial last year. “It’s been more than a year. I have been writing to agencies requesting them to clarify the status of booster doses for trial volunteers. Their focus, though, would be to achieve maximum coverage of first and second doses in the population,” he said. On Saturday, Dr Suresh, with help from his friends in the medical fraternity, took the third dose privately. “Hope the government takes a decision soon for healthcare personnel, who come in close contact with patients, or are immunocompromised,” he said. A few doctors, even from government hospitals, have been taking their third doses eight to nine months after their first two shots . Dr Avinash Supe, former dean of KEM hospital, said many countries have started providing booster doses. “If vaccines are available at centres and healthcare workers are keen on taking their booster shots, the government should allow them to, but at their own expense,” said Supe. A trial volunteer said, “We are not sure if there are any health implications. We also want clarity on whether we can mix different vaccine doses,” he said. Another volunteer said he took the third shot abroad. Dr NK Arora, chief of Covid-19 working group of National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation in India (NTAGI) said that data on breakthrough infections is constantly being monitored. “There are two types of immune response visible and invisible. Just because there is a drop in antibodies, one need not rush for a booster dose. There is also cellular immunity, which is considered to be much more robust. Since a large number of Indians were naturally infected with the virus in the second wave, we have also developed hybrid immunity,” said Arora.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-docs-vax-trial-participants-opt-for-3rd-dose-privately/articleshow/87955233.cms||Yogita Rao

We will release guidelines in the coming week,” he said. On booster doses, Arora said that the centre is still reviewing literature to frame a policy. “Our topmost priority currently is to reach out to the 10-12 crore unimmunised population.

The CM alleged that there was a purported move to destroy the cooperative sector in the state. Addressing the CPM area committee meeting in Pinarayi, the CM said that the central government has destroyed the public sector. He said that the central government’s encroachment into some sectors was done to target certain states. He said that Kerala has the strongest cooperative sector in the country. “Moves are being made to destroy the cooperative sector in various forms. A new department has been formed at the Centre. The Supreme Court had made observations against it. The federal system is being destroyed by the BJP government,” he said. Vijayan said that states had power over some subjects but the Centre was making laws even in those subjects. “This has happened in sectors like agriculture, cooperatives, electricity, etc,” he added. His statements came in the backdrop of RBI sticking to restrictions against cooperative banks, and reiterating that these societies can’t call themselves banks. Earlier, alongside the Centre, states too used to make revenue out of the taxes it could collect but now, the avenues for states to impose taxes are being destroyed one step at a time, he said. “Earlier when the Planning Commission existed in the country, there was a platform for the states to express their opinions. There were discussions with the states. Now the Planning Commission itself does not exist,” the CM said. CM said that another thing that needed serious attention was the federalism in the country. “We need to understand that Jammu and Kashmir lost its statehood overnight. We need to realize the dangerous manner in which things are getting implemented,” he said. Vijayan said that problems are coming up near Kerala too. “Lakshadweep is an area which was considered almost a part of Kerala in the past. Kerala and Lakshadweep have a very strong connection. However, Sangh Parivar has started rolling its bulldozers over those islands too,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/centre-trying-to-destroy-states-cooperative-sector-says-pinarayi/articleshow/87954734.cms||---

Most MSRTC buses have resumed services from Saturday morning as the condition is coming back to normalcy. The situation had got tense at the MSRTC bus stand premises on Saturday when a few agitators started protesting at the premises saying that the strike will go on further till the demand for the merger of MSRTC into the state government is fulfilled. Amidst the chaos, Shahupuri police detained these 20 staffers and took them to the police station. Meanwhile, the ongoing chaos at the bus stand created confusion for the passengers. Aniket Jambhale, a passenger said, "On Friday night it was said that the strike has been called off and hence, we came to the bus stand premises looking for a bus to Sangli. For a few seconds we were surprised to see the staffers still protesting, but then the police detained them. Hopefully, all the MSRTC buses start plying soon and everything gets streamlined."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/most-kolhapur-buses-operational-few-protestors-detained-by-cops/articleshow/87953596.cms||---

While forest officials chase the wild boars into deep forests now and then, they always return and damage the crops,” Madheva said.When contacted, a forest official with Jeerahalli forest range said they had submitted a report to the state government recently, mentioning about the increase in wild boar population in the region. “We are waiting for the government's direction. We will try our best to control its population.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/wild-boars-raid-sorghum-crop-on-four-acres-in-erode-village/articleshow/87954729.cms||---

While the new variant is yet to be traced in the country, people coming from South Africa, Botswana and Hong Kong, where the variant has been identified, are made to undergo Covid testing and kept under close observation for a couple of days.Health department officials said while there were no direct flights from these countries, people arriving at the city airport through connecting flights from Chennai and Bengaluru would be closely monitored. P Aruna, deputy director of health services, said a special medical team was stationed at the airport to screen the passengers from the countries hit by the Omicron variant. “We haven’t so far seen any traveller from such countries. If there are any in the coming days, they will be subjected to RT-PCR test at the airport and kept in home quarantine for a few days.” She said they were expecting more people to make use of the mass vaccination drive on Sundays to get inoculated, as the reports about the new variant had instilled fear among a section of them. “Being a mutated variant, it is expected to be more virulent.”About 6.8 lakh people are eligible for their second dose in the district, where 2.4 lakh people are yet to take the first dose. “We have sufficient stock of vaccine and could inoculate more than two lakh people in a single day. But the reduced interest among the people is affecting the vaccination drive.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/new-coronavirus-variant-enhanced-vigil-at-airport/articleshow/87954724.cms||---

Cops suspect monetary dispute was the reason behind the killing. Police identified the accused as Vikas alias Vicky, a native of Uttarakhand, who was at present living in south Delhi’s Dakshinpuri. According to police, on Thursday they received information from a hospital that a person, Avinash, was admitted with a gunshot injury. He later succumbed to his injuries.

When they reached near K-block in Dakshinpuri, Vicky stopped them. “Avinash and Vicky had some altercation over money. Suddenly Vicky took out a pistol and shot Avinash in the head,” an officer said. A team was formed under ACP (CR Park) Manu Himanshu and Vicky was arrested on Friday evening. Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) Benita Mary Jaiker said, a pistol along with four live cartridges were recovered from Vicky. The accused told police that he worked as a financier and to instil fear in his clients, he always carried a pistol.

To prevent people from purchasing tomatoes from the farmers markets’ and selling them outside, agriculture department officials have instructed the traders not to sell in bulk quantities.A trader from RS Puram farmers’ market confirmed that tomatoes were sold at Rs 58 per kg on the day. “We are selling only 2kg per person, as per the directions of officials.”G Sudakar, manager of a wholesale shop at MGR Market, said the wholesale price of tomato was anywhere between Rs 45 and Rs 60, depending on the quality and variety. He attributed the drastic drop in prices to the sudden arrival of tomatoes from Mysuru and Nashik. “The price might come down further before stabilizing. However, the price might not dip below Rs 30 in the wholesale market anytime sooner,” Sudakar said.Meanwhile, the farmers in the district are in a hurry to sell their produce, which they had harvested recently. V Sundaravadivel, a farmer from Kuniyamuthur, said, “We had harvested tomatoes a few days ago. It is better to sell the produce now, as the price might drop further in the coming days. We had lost plenty of tomatoes to the rain and we cannot afford any further loss,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tomato-price-drops-to-rs-58-as-stock-arrives-from-mysuru-and-nashik/articleshow/87954725.cms||---
---||Delhi||Efficient functioning: Police station work plan redrawn in Delhi||NEW DELHI: To ensure smooth functioning of police stations in the city, the Delhi Police commissioner has decided to divide the work of a police station among three inspectors. On Friday, police chief Rakesh Asthana issued a standing order in which he redesignated the inspector handling anti-terrorist operations as inspector for law & order. The order also listed the duties of station house officers, inspectors (investigation) and inspectors (law & order). The top cop clarified that the SHO, an inspector rank officer, would be the chief investigating officer for the purpose of investigating as provided for under sections 154 to 173 of the Criminal Procedure Code. He would also supervise the work and conduct of the inspectors for law & order and investigation. “In case either inspector (investigation) or inspector (law & order) is not posted for a while or is on leave, then the SHO himself will look after the work of the inspector (investigation) or inspector (law and order) as the case may be in addition to his duties,” the standing order said. Asthana’s order also said, “The SHO shall be the public face of the police station and attend to all complainants and ingeniously put in a system whereby the complainants are empathetically heard and at any given time one inspector rank officer is present to handle any complaint.” The SHO is also to respond to “quell any undercurrents of social unrest”. The police chief added that no one was to be unnecessarily detained at the police station. The SHO should ensure capacity building of the staff so that they were trained in every aspect of investigation, including cybercrime and scientific collection of forensic evidence. Meanwhile, the inspector (investigation) will allocate probe work to the personnel and fix a time frame for the investigation of any case. He is to be an integral component of the entire investigation process right from the initial stage to the final chargesheet. “The focus of the inspector (investigation) would primarily be monitoring the investigation of cases and he shall not be put to any other duty without the express order of the ACP,” the standing order read. The inspector (law & order) is responsible for peace and public tranquillity in the area. All community policing projects will be monitored by the officer, including all online and offline complaints related to public order, preventive action, public nuisance and area security as assigned by the SHO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/efficient-functioning-police-station-work-plan-redrawn/articleshow/87955249.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Double announcements leave multiplexes baffled||PUNE: Two announcements, one for the state and another for the district, on Saturday caused confusion among multiplex owners and auditoriums, as more relaxations in the existing Covid norms were announced. Pune guardian minister Ajit Pawar on Saturday said the district administration will do away with the 50% operation curbs on cinema halls and theatres from December 1. However, a separate order issued by state chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on further easing restrictions stated that in case of any programme/ event/ activity happening in an enclosed/closed space, such as a cinema hall, theatre, marriage and convention halls, people up to 50% of the capacity of the space would be allowed. A representative from a prominent multiplex chain told TOI, “In such situations, we follow what has been given in black and white. In this case, it’s the state government order on operations continuing at 50% capacity in multiplexes and other such places.” Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol had tweeted on Saturday, “Permission for 100% attendance in theatres and cinemas in Pune!A decision has been taken to allow 100% attendance in theatres and cinemas from December 1 in compliance with the rules. The issue was raised in the review meeting of the Guardian Minister today.” पुण्यात नाट्यगृह, चित्रपटगृहांना १०० टक्के उपस्थितीची परवानगी !नाट्यगृह आणि चित्रपटगृहामंध्ये १ डिसेंबरपासून नियम… https://t.co/DIaxuO2DE0— Murlidhar Mohol (@mohol_murlidhar) 1637997462000He said, “The two different announcements caused massive confusions among our operational team on Saturday.” Prakash Chaphalkar, secretary of the Multiplex Association of India told TOI, “We expect a clarity from authorities on both the announcements. We would follow the written orders when they come, most likely by Monday.” Chaphalkar said, “Initial four to six weeks have been a soft start for us. We had been positive about things falling in place for multiplexes by mid-December or before in terms of 100% operations. We are thus prepared.” Though Pawar did not explicitly mention “restaurants” also being allowed to operate at 100% capacity from December 1, a tweet by an MLA included restaurants in the list of establishments to have got this relaxation under the Pawar’s announcement. Vikram Shetty, owner of Sadanand Resort and Sadanand Regency, said, “We will wait for official orders from the PMC. As per the state order, programme/ event/ activity in an enclosed/ closed space, people up to 50% of the capacity of the space will be allowed. In case of open to sky spaces, people up to 25% of space capacity will be allowed. More clarity is needed from local authorities on what should be followed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/double-announcements-leave-multiplexes-baffled/articleshow/87954726.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Lucknow||Akhilesh Yadav likens Lakhimpur Kheri to Jallianwala Bagh||LUCKNOW: Drawing a parallel between farmers killed in Lakhimpur Kheri incident and those who lost their lives at the hands of the British firing squad at Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday said the difference was that the British fired from the front while poor farmers were mowed down from behind. SP’s alliance partner, Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) president Om Prakash Rajbhar, also attacked the BJP for pitching Hindus against Muslims for political gains and “selling the country away” in the name of asset monetisation. The two leaders were addressing a public meeting in Hardoi on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of Maharaj Salhiya Arkvanshi Sthapna Diwas where they trained guns at the BJP and also made a slew of promises, including electricity at affordable rates, threefold increase in financial assistance to women and cops. Akhilesh started off by pointing out at the people wearing red caps (SP’s colour) and carrying yellow scarves and flags (colour of SBSP). “Yahan sab taraf lal aur peela rang dekh kar Delhi aur Lucknow mein baithe log lal peele ho rahe honge (Looking at the red and yellow colour here people sitting in Delhi and Lucknow will turn red-faced),” he said. Striking a local connect, Akhilesh said due to poor policies of the BJP, trade involving sale of the famous Sandila laddoos had been hit hard and many traders had to shut shops because of rising prices and unemployment. Lashing out at the BJP for the Lakhimpur Kheri incident where farmers were run over by a jeep belonging to the son of the Union minister of state for home, Akhilesh said: “Ye BJP wale sirf jeebh chalate hain aur jeep chadahte hain (These BJP people know how to use their tongue and crush people under a four-wheeler).” He said the murder of four members of a family in Prayagrag reflected complete failure of the government as victims had approached everyone from the local police station to the district magistrate for help but were eventually hacked to death. SBSP chief OP Rajbhar kept addressing Akhilesh as “bhaavi mukhyamantri” (future chief minister). He went on to promise major relief in power bills after Akhilesh is sworn in as the chief minister after the 2022 polls. He promised to ensure implementation of the recommendations of the Social Justice Report, monthly remuneration to village chowkidars, to bring in a law to ensure eight-hour shifts and weekly offs in the police department. He said BJP wanted people to only focus on Hindu-Muslim issue as they don’t want them to remember they had failed to fulfil the promises they had made before the elections. “BJP says Hindus are in danger… we have a Hindu PM, Hindu home minister, Hindu defence minister … then how come Hindus are in danger,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yadav-likens-kheri-to-jallianwala-bagh/articleshow/87955258.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

Officials said that only 800 streetlights remain to be replaced, which would be done by the end of this month. The project is being implemented on Public Private Partnership (PPP) model under the Union government’s Smart City mission. The installation of the new LED lights would enable NMC to save around 60% on energy bills on streetlights for which it pays around Rs 2.75 cr a month to MSEDCL. For road users, the visibility of the road would be better in new LED lights. “We have already completed almost 91% work of the smart streetlight project and remaining 1% of the streetlights are to be replaced with LED ones within a month,” said Sumant More, CEO, NMSCDCL. The smart LED streetlights have been installed with functional features like remote dimming control, remote on-off option, timer, GPS Map representation. The smart LED streetlights across city are to be monitored through Command Control Centre, which is being set up at Panchavati divisional office of NMC. The command control centre will monitor everything from timing of switching on and off of the lights as per guidelines defined by the National Lighting Code. The project is envisaged on PPP mode to replace all the existing streetlights with smart LEDs and smart panels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-gets-over-90k-led-lights-for-streets/articleshow/87953599.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Nagpur||‘Abject poverty compels Asha workers to work without pay’||Accredited Social Health Activists, popularly known as Asha workers, comprise widows, separated women and those below poverty line (BPL). As the government launched an aggressive Covid vaccination drive to meet its target, Asha workers played a major role in mass mobilization of the unvaccinated by going door to door like they do in any government health programme. Their efforts helped the local administration in a big way, but at the end of the day, Asha workers felt short-changed when they allegedly didn’t get the guaranteed pay. Led by the Centre of Indian Trade Union (CITU) and Asha Gatpravartak Karamchari Union (AGKU), the foot soldiers have boycotted all Covid work. Comrade Rajendra Sathe, district CITU-AGKU president, talks about the plight of Asha workers in an exclusive interview with TOI. Excerpts... Q. What’s the background of Asha workers and their job profile?A. Around 955 Asha workers are affiliated with AGKU in the city limits. They come from a financially weak background and work under exacting circumstances. Widows, divorced women and those from socially backward classes (BPL) enrol for this employment scheme. Asha workers’ primary job is to survey homes to document the profiles of pregnant women and newborns. They are also assigned different health programmes launched from time to time.Q. How much money do they manage to earn?A. For door to door work, they get Rs 1,650 per month. They need to encourage expecting mothers to get all the treatment and delivery done at a government hospital only. They have to submit all records. They also need to attend a monthly day-long meeting against an allowance of Rs150. Another Rs100 per month is paid if they bring pregnant women and newborns for vaccination at primary health centres. This was Rs150 earlier. A health committee comprising 10 women from each area or locality has to be formed. Every month they have to hold a meeting. Asha is secretary of the committee. She gets Rs150 for this work to create awareness among pregnant women. They are paid only if the meeting is held. But 50% Asha workers don’t have a health committee so they don’t get paid. In all, they don’t earn more than Rs2,050 per month from their routine pre and post-natal work.Q. What are the other tasks and income opportunities for them?A. Some activities are forcibly burdened on Asha workers without pay. A survey of patients of leprosy or diabetes is one such example. It goes on for six months. They are entitled to a Rs1,000 pay out which is never paid on time. In Covid times, Asha workers were called for door to door survey. They slogged at odd hours without any safety measures like mask, sanitzers and PPE kits. Many Asha workers got infected but they never got any help from the adminstiration for treatment or loss of employment. One died but her family received no help. She was a new recruit. She wasn’t given any training but directly asked to start work. Her kids became orphaned. The administration said there is no payout provision for them during Covid duty.Q. What compels them to work without pay?A. Abject poverty. When Covid was at its peak, all work was done by Asha workers but the credit was claimed by officials. No payment has been given for Covid work by the state government and district authorities. Covid vaccination work was also forced on Asha workers. The govenment order states that whoever encourages citizens to get vaccinated shall be given Rs200 per day. There is no mention of Asha workers though they are the ones doing it. The authorities pressured Asha workers to do vaccination work and also issued show cause notices. Now, at the time of payment, the health department says it didn’t ask Asha workers to do Covid vaccination work. Asha workers can’t even afford a meagre Rs10 to buy vegetables. Do they have a choice when workload is increased without guarantee of additional pay? They first make them economically weak by holding back their dues or not paying them at all. And then, they threaten Asha workers.Q. The administration alleged that Asha workers protest whenever any major drive is undertaken.A. In Covid times, all government and private employees continued to get their salaries despite staying at home. Asha workers were out in the field. What should one do when they are asked to work without pay? We also say don’t make us go on strike. Give us work and pay on time. As per the Central Labour Commission, any worker must get a minimum Rs18,000 per month. But they are paying Asha workers only Rs2,000. The Constitution gives us the right to fight for our rights. Farmers fought for their rights and the government had to bow before them. We have also demanded six months’ maternity leave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/abject-poverty-compels-asha-workers-to-work-without-pay/articleshow/87952568.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Pune||Future hinges on potency of new Covid variant, following rules, say experts||PUNE: Public health experts and epidemiologists observed that the severity of the probable third wave in India would hinge on the transmission efficiency of the new variant and Covid appropriate behaviour of people, while many states have started gearing up for it in the wake of the rising cases in Europe. “Vigil on the new variant, emphasis on genomic surveillance, vaccination and community engagement to ensure Covid appropriate behaviour should the focus areas now,” Dr Samiran Panda, the head of the epidemiology and infectious diseases division of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), told TOI, adding that non-essential travel should be checked. He said if the third wave came, its intensity in different states or districts would depend on four factors — the relaxation of restrictive measures in a given state or district, the waning of acquired immunity post-infection and/or post-vaccination, the emergence of variants that could escape vaccine-induced immunity and emergence of variants that could get transmitted with greater efficiency compared to the earlier circulating strains. “These possibilities have been considered during a mathematical modelling exercise undertaken by ICMR in collaboration with Imperial College. This helps in using local data for local-level decision-making and action applicable to a district or a state,” he added.  Health officials from the Union government said India cannot take the rising cases lightly and Covid protocols should be strictly followed. Against this backdrop, experts said, rampant violation of Covid appropriate behaviour was a worry. Eminent virologist Dr Gagandeep Kang told TOI that any third, fourth or fifth waves would be milder if there was no new variant because of pre-existing immunity due to infection or vaccination in our population. Virologist TJ John told TOI that a third wave was still unlikely despite the appearance of the B.1.1.529 variant because the country had reached the endemic phase as more than 85% of population developed infection-induced immunity. On a cautionary note, John said, “The new variant has to be watched. The best way to counter its spread is travel-related precautions to and from countries where this variant is known and boosting immunity with booster dose for all those who have received the two vaccine doses long ago, especially health and frontline workers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/future-hinges-on-potency-of-new-variant-following-rules/articleshow/87954730.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Pawar said that the Covid-19 jumbo hospitals set up at Shivajinagar and in the PCMC areas would not be dismantled at yet. He said that considering the concerns sparked by the emergence of the new Covid variant, the infrastructure would remain in place and a decision regarding the dismantling of the facilities would be taken during a review meeting, which would be held on December 31. He said that lots of efforts were taken and it would be easy to pull down the facilities, but if they had to set it up again it would be time consuming. “As of now, the status quo remains,” he said, after the district’s Covid-19 review meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/decision-on-dismantling-jumbo-hosps-by-year-end/articleshow/87954739.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The preliminary probe has revealed that the suspects, in an attempt to evade taxes and different RTO fees, might have committed the alleged act. Swapnil Rathod, Gevrai sub-division police officer, told TOI, “The incident first came to the notice of our detection branch officer who spotted two autorickshaws with the same registration number standing next to each other.” The police spotted something amiss when the two vehicles were seized and their respective drivers were asked to produce the vehicles’ documents. After the incident came to the notice of senior police officers, a dedicated drive was initiated just to check the registration numbers of auto-rickshaws, only to find nine rickshaws bearing registration number MH-23-AR-311. All these vehicles have been seized and parked at the Gevrai police station. A letter has been sent to the Beed-based RTO office seeking details of these seized vehicles. Sources said that most of these seized vehicles were purchased during the lockdown period and were given temporary registration. As per the procedure, within a fortnight of getting temporary registration, the permanent registration number should be obtained by paying all the taxes, passing and other fees. The authorities added, some drivers have cited that during the lockdown period, different government offices including the RTO office was closed, due to which they could not follow the procedure to obtain a permanent registration number. A senior police officer said so far, no offence has been registered in this case. "The decision to register a cheating case or to initiate action under Motor Vehicles Act will be taken after receiving a detailed reply from the RTO authorities," said Rathod.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/beed-police-seize-nine-autorickshaws-with-same-registration-number-plates/articleshow/87953606.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Wife’s convenience dominating factor for justifying transfer of matter: Allahabad HC||PRAYAGRAJ: Allowing a transfer application filed by a woman seeking transfer of proceedings of a divorce case, the Allahabad high court has observed that the “applicant-wife, having no one in her family to escort her to the court, is a good ground for the transfer of a case”. While allowing an application filed by the applicant-wife, Justice Vivek Varma referred and relied upon several apex court judgments and further observed, “In matrimonial cases, the convenience of the wife is the dominating factor for justifying the transfer of a matter.” The husband of the applicant filed a petition before the Kanpur Nagar court against the applicant seeking a divorce. Thereafter, the wife filed the present transfer application seeking transfer of the case proceedings from Kanpur Nagar to Prayagraj. She contended before the court that being a young woman, she cannot travel to the Kanpur, which is about 200km from Prayagraj, where she is currently working as a resident doctor at Kamla Nehru Memorial Hospital, to defend the proceedings as there is no one to escort her to the court as she lives alone at Prayagraj. On the other hand, the opposite party, her husband claimed before the court that the applicant-wife would stay at Prayagraj for a temporary period till completion of her diploma course. He also alleged that the present transfer application had been filed only to delay and linger the divorce proceedings. He further asserted that there is a serious threat to his life at Prayagraj. Regarding the husband’s apprehension of threat to life, the court said that it was not based on any cogent material and as such, this plea cannot be accepted. After hearing both sides, the court observed, “It is pertinent to state that there is no straight jacket formula that can be adopted in order to determine the transfer proceedings. It is not a mandatory rule that the transfer applications are always to be transferred for the asking of the wife. But at the same time, the wife, in situations where she is disadvantaged on recognized parameters, for the sake of equity, her interests are to be safeguarded.” The court in its decision dated November 25, directed transfer of petition of the husband seeking divorce from Family Court, Kanpur Nagar to the competent court of Prayagraj. The court further directed that the transferee court shall thereafter make it convenient to ensure that the case is disposed of as early as possible within six months of the receipt of the record.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/wifes-convenience-dominating-factor-for-justifying-transfer-of-matter-hc/articleshow/87954747.cms||---

The condition of the six injured warkaris is critical, police said. The warkaris were headed to Alandi from Khalapur when the driver of the pick-up truck, who was feeling drowsy, lost control over the vehicle, leading to the accident, police said. The Vadgaon Maval police identified the deceased as Savita Walku Yeram (55) and Vimal Suresh Chorghe (50) of Khalapur, Jayashri Atmaram Pawar (54) and Sangeeta Vasant Shinde (56) of Karjat. The four women succumbed to their injuries at different hospitals. The police moved the injured warkaris to different hospitals in Somatne Phata, Kamshet and Kanhe. TimesViewPolice should immediately intensify patrolling on highways crisscrossing the state, especially the stretches near big town and cities, to prevent fatal accidents at night and early hours of the day. Restriction on the movement of heavy vehicles on old Pune-Mumbai and Pune-Nashik highways after four warkaris lost their lives is a temporary solution. Exemplary action against the drowsy truck driver involved in Saturday’s accident can be a deterrent.

Citing that the state had enough vaccine doses, he said the health and frontline workers had taken the shots almost eight-nine months ago. “We urge them (Centre) to take a decision soon in the view of the new surge in infections in Europe,” he told TOI, adding that the healthcare and frontline workers were more prone to infections because of the sectors they were associated with. Batting for the booster dose to health workers and immunocompromised individuals, Indian Medical Association’s national president Dr J A Jayalal said, “We at IMA support the demand for booster dose to healthcare workers and the additional doses should be administered to immunocompromised individuals, especially people on chemotherapy and severe diabetes.” He said currently the priority was on ensuring that all above the age of 18 years got the first dose of vaccine and more than 50 crore people should get fully vaccinated with the second dose at the earliest. “With the impending threat of the third wave, it is also important for empowering the healthcare workers with the booster dose to augment their immunity as they will be subjected to heavy load of viral exposure,” he said. Dr Jayalal said IMA lost more than 2,000 doctors in the battle against Covid-19. Amid reports that there were more than 24 crore doses of vaccine in the cold storage, allocating 3 crore doses for the healthcare workers as booster doses would be definitely a fruitful exercise, he said. Another city clinician, who did not wish to be named, said the decision on booster doses should be taken soon by the Centre as there were enough doses, against the backdrop of a huge surge of cases abroad. “We have to protect those vulnerable with booster doses, especially health workers, immunocompromised individuals and those with low immunity,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/booster-dose-must-for-health-staff-those-with-low-immunity-experts/articleshow/87954763.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Top virologists and public health expert say the issue of utmost important in the circumstances is to ensure full vaccination. Read AlsoNo need to panic over new Covid-19 variant: ICMRAmid mounting concern over cases of new 'variant of concern' Omicron, the ICMR on Saturday said there is no need to panic and urged people to not delay their second vaccine dose. “The structural changes detected in the virus may not necessarily give rise to a functional change of concern. It may not“Even now, there are nearly 16-17 crore people in the country who haven’t got a single dose of the vaccine,” said Dr N K Mehra, former dean of AIIMS and honorary emeritus scientist, Indian Council of Medical Research. He said that Covid vaccines might not ensure 100% protection against infection, but there was credible data to show it did protect against the infection turning severe. Mehra said the elderly and immune-compromised persons, such as cancer patients and organ transplant recipients, should be prioritised for vaccination. “Some of these people have received two doses of the vaccine. They may require an additional dose because studies suggest they have sub-optimal response to the vaccines,” he said. Countries like the US, UK and Israel have already allowed booster doses to high-risk groups. Apart from providing additional protection to the immune-compromised patients, a third dose could help prevent mutations, said experts. The immune-compromised act as hosts for mutations of the coronavirus because of prolonged infection. “Omicron, according to initial reports, was first detected in a patient suffering from HIV/AIDS in South Africa,” said a doctor. “While healthy individuals tend to recover from Covid in 2-3 weeks, immune-compromised patients can continue to remain positive for 2-3 months.” Read AlsoOmicron: Several states sound alert; world scurries to contain new variant of concernNEW DELHI: Delhi, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and other Indian states sounded caution on Saturday amid emergence of a new Covid variant called Omicron that has the potential to be more resistant to the protection offered by vaccines. Earlier today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a high-level meetingAIIMS Trauma Centre, which turned into a Covid-only hospital during the pandemic, had more than 50 patients with chronic kidney failure who persisted with the virus for more than three months, especially during the first wave. Another 40 patients, who remained Covid-positive for over a month, had haematological and other cancers, doctors pointed out. According to Dr Rajesh Malhotra, chief of AIIMS Trauma Centre, there was a need to intensify well-established practices of testing, tracking and treating to prevent any new variant from causing a public health calamity. He said, “We have to definitely restrict travel from the affected countries and quarantine people arriving in India from there. We also must enhance surveillance and increase genomic sequencing for early detection of all cases of new or emergency variants.” The Omicron variant, Malhotra explained, was a new one and there wasn’t much known about its ability to escape immunity generated by vaccination or natural infection. “It is important for us to know how our indigenous or locally administered vaccines will protect against this variant because this variant has mainly shown breakthrough infections in Johnson and Johnson and Pfizer vaccines. Let us hope our vaccines protect better,” he said. Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, epidemiologist and public health systems expert, stressed on the need to adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour. “We need to do away with the complacency that seems to have set in over the last few months.

An outline of its functioning has already been prepared. He was speaking after inaugurating the annual general meeting of the Association of Planters of Kerala held in Kochi on Friday. He said that a meeting of the ministers of revenue, industries and senior officials would be convened soon in the presence of the chief minister to resolve the legal hurdles the plantation sector face. The minister said that the government aims to bring in more jobs and investment and has taken strong steps to benefit the MSME sector. Work tourism will be the next revolutionary change in Kerala, he said. With the proliferation of work from home, anyone from any part of the world can come and work in Kerala. The government will provide them with all the basic facilities they need. Keralites have set a new history of turning crises into opportunities. He said the government’s decision to repeal or amend 227 obsolete laws was in response to persistent demand from industry and commerce. Chairman of APK, S B Prabhakar said that the state should take steps to amend The Kerala Land Reforms Act and the outdated land utilization order for allowing cultivation and value addition of suitable crops and animal husbandry activities in plantations, without changing the basic structure of plantations. He said that the single revenue stream of monocrop culture has outlived its utility since the advent of free market economy. “With the wide range of agro-climatic zones, our state has the potential to grow the majority of the crops that are grown elsewhere in the country and worldwide. The directorate of agriculture, KAU, has come out with a detailed report on the crops that can be grown in these zones. However, it is easier said than done, as we need policy support and permission from the state government for speedy implementation,” he said.

The indicators under education are schooling years and school attendance. Under the standard of living comes indicators - cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing, assets and bank account. The MPI measure is based on the reference period of 2015-16 of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS).

The delay of a year in the counselling has essentially meant that around 1.6 lakh junior doctors are not in the healthcare network and not are earning anything. “The fact that an entire batch of students are not working has increased the workload on the other two batches of junior doctors. Of them, many are also preparing for their exams. But most importantly, at a time when the World Health Organisation (WHO) has given an alert about a possible third wave in the country in January, keeping such a large number of doctors off the healthcare system could mean a disaster,” said Dr Sagar Dharmasula, president TJUDA. Unlike junior doctors in several other parts of the country who have decided to boycott duties, junior doctors in Telangana are not boycotting duties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/neet-counselling-delay-junior-docs-hold-candlelight-stir/articleshow/87954817.cms||---

She grew up to conquer some of the toughest ones like the Nanda Devi and Mount Everest. The 62-year-old has now scaled another peak. She has become the first woman in the history of the Indian Mountaineering Foundation to become its president. The award-winning climber, educationist and environmentalist secured 70 out of 107 votes in the 60-year-old organisation's latest election to clinch yet another victory, this time breaking a "snow ceiling" as some of her contemporaries joked. IMF is the apex body for mountaineering and allied adventure sports activities in the country. "As IMF president my priority will be to encourage more girls to take up climbing," Bisht said. “We will focus on promoting activities like sport climbing, which was recently included as an Olympic event. We will also emphasise on mountaineering policies, disaster management and coordination with other training institutes.” After completing her BA and MA in economics, Bisht joined the Nehru Institute of Mountaineering in Uttarkashi from where she did a course in climbing in 1975. In 1981, she became one of the first three women to scale the main peak of Nanda Devi. That year she won the Arjuna award for mountaineering. Three years later, in 1984, she summited the Everest. It was during this expedition that she came across the work of Edmund Hillary in conserving mountains and wanted to follow that path. She then founded the ‘Save Gangotri Project’ to safeguard the region around the origin of the Ganga. In 1991, she started a campaign to preserve Bhojpatra trees, a species native to the Himalayas, and planted hundreds of saplings in the Gangotri national park region. For this, she was awarded the Edmund Hillary Mountain Legacy medal in 2013. “An irresponsible tourism setup ends up damaging the ecology," Bisht said. "Having lived and worked in the Himalayas, I feel strongly about responsible tourism, which would maintain a balance between economy and ecology. Tourists must and will come to the hills, but they have to act responsibly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/climber-breaks-snow-ceiling-is-1st-woman-to-head-top-mountaineering-body/articleshow/87954247.cms||Abhyudaya Kotnala

The victim suffered bullet injuries in his stomach. “One of the arrested men is the brother of the injured man. In order to protect him, the victim gave the police a misleading statement saying that three men on a motorcycle had opened fire at him and then fled towards Katraj,” said senior inspector Shankar Khatake of Warje police station. “The victim is admitted at a private hospital in Erandwane and hospital authorities told us that he is stable,” he added. Khatake said that the arrested the duo were residents of Warje. “One of the two suspects had bought a country-made pistol and the duo decided to test the weapon and wanted to check how it fired. The two gathered near the victim’s residence and started discussing the weapon and loaded it. At this moment, the victim came out and the pistol went off. He suffered bullet wounds on his stomach. He raised an alarm and the two stood at their spot. They hid the pistol and pretended as if they had come to the spot after the victim raised an alarm.” The police have seized the country-made pistol. “The victim told us that he had woken up and gotten out of his house to relieve himself, when the suspects opened fire in his direction from the service road area of the Katraj-Dehu Road bypass near the Warje flyover. The reason behind the attack on him was not known and it was not matching with his statements,” he said. The inspector said the victim’s brother was acting suspiciously after the incident. “We decided to question him, following which he gave up and narrated the incident. He said he wasaid checking the pistol with his friend when it went off and the bullet hit his elder brother.” Police have registered the case of attempt to murder and common intention in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/two-men-arrested-for-opening-fire-at-34-year-old/articleshow/87954783.cms||---

Addressing party booth in-charges, Maurya said, “It is the victory of the ideology of BJP that the opposition leaders, who showed their back to temple and mega religious affairs like Kumbh, have started running from temple to other, wearing janeu and bathing in Kumbh”.

---||Visakhapatnam||AP: Absence of radium stickers, tail lamps in vehicles key reason for road mishaps||VISAKHAPATNAM: Despite repeated calls to affix radium stickers on the rear side of vehicles to make them visible at night, motorists, particularly heavy vehicles, continue to disregard them. The police have observed that low visibility and absence of reflective radium stickers and tail lamps in heavy vehicles have become the prime reasons for the road accidents during winter season on the highways in Vizag and some parts of Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts. The data from the NCRB on accidental deaths and suicides in India-2020 shows that a total of 7,039 people lost their lives and 19,675 people suffered injuries in 17,924 road accidents in Andhra Pradesh in 2020. The data also shows that weather condition was the reason for 207 road accidents in which 85 people lost their lives and 178 suffered injuries. “Speeding vehicles hit heavy vehicles plying without tail lamps and reflective radium stickers on the NHs because we cannot see the heavy vehicles till they come dangerously close. In winter season, low visibility coupled with absence of tail lamps and reflectors add to the problem. I have observed that some motorists continue to install powerful headlights, thereby not only causing much inconvenience to other road users (who are coming from the opposite direction) but also risking their own life as the beam of the headlights causes temporary blindness,” said K Srinivasa Reddy, a resident of Vizag city. “Vehicles without radium reflectors and tail lamps are mainly responsible for the mishaps during the wee hours and night hours on the NHs. Such vehicles are difficult to spot from a distance of 100 meters during winter season due to low visibility. We are chalking out plans to impose spot fines on vehicles plying without tail lamps and radium stickers to minimise road accidents,” said ADCP (traffic) Vizag, Ch Adinarayana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/absence-of-radium-stickers-tail-lamps-in-vehicles-key-reason-for-road-mishaps/articleshow/87954255.cms||Nalla.Babu

This will become a new lifeline for Imphal, which is now primarily dependent on the road network for getting essential supplies. Though the crucial 111 km Jiribam (Assam border) to Imphal new line project has been delayed due to several reasons, the Northeast Frontier Railway has now accelerated the work to complete it within the revised timeline. This link is crucial as nearly 70% of Manipur's population lives in Imphal and at a later stage, this railway line may be extended till Myanmar border for the proposed Trans-Asian railway line. The broad gauge railway line project is part of the government’s move to connect all the capitals of northeastern states by rail with the rest of the country. The Jiribam-Imphal rail link will also help reduce travel time as currently it takes 11-12 hours to complete the 200-225 km journey between these two points. Once the rail operation starts, trains will cover this stretch in just two and a half hours. Besides the economic and social benefits associated with this project, it is going to be an engineering marvel for railways. The rail line project will have 46 tunnels, including a 12-km single tube tunnel which will be the second longest in Indian Railways network. It will have 153 bridges. One of the bridges, Noney Bridge, which is under construction, is slated to become the world's tallest rail bridge on piers as two out of the seven piers will be of 141 meters each. The other piers vary between 50 meters to 90 meters. Currently, Mala-Rijeka viaduct on Belgrade-Bar railway line in Europe is the tallest where the height of pillars is 139 meters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/work-expedited-to-bring-imphal-on-railway-map/articleshow/87956057.cms||Dipak K Dash

They were handed to the police, authorities said. According to the information given out by the media cell and protocol division of AIIMS, the security team nabbed three touts as part of a campaign to prevent such illegal activities inside the hospital campus. “The security department of AIIMS, New Delhi, conducted a special drive to nab touts of various diagnostic labs who misguide the public in the name of conducting tests at cheaper rates. AIIMS has state-of-art laboratories that function under the most experienced staff and are world-famous for giving accurate results,” a statement issued by the institute stated. AIIMS recently installed a ‘smart lab’ that has the capacity to conduct over two lakh tests in a single day. The institute also extended the timing for sample collection for various tests. Officials said with the new robotic laboratory, more than 95% of the investigations are available the same day that the samples are collected. This particularly applies to investigations involving haematology (haemoglobin, blood counts, etc.) clinical chemistry (glucose, liver function test, kidney function test etc) and serology (related to antibodies to infectious viral agents etc).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/3-touts-held-at-aiims-for-luring-people-to-cheap-labs/articleshow/87955329.cms||---
---||Lucknow||UP wants only ‘baba’, not ‘bua’ or ‘babua’, says Rajnath Singh||JAUNPUR: Claiming that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will retain power in Uttar Pradesh with a “three-fourth majority”, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday strongly endorsed chief minister Yogi Adityanath for a second term, saying that the state does not want “bua or babua”, apparently referring to Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati and Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav, but wants only “baba” (Yogi) in 2022. “I don’t like calling anyone ‘babua’ or ‘bua’. I also don’t have an objection if some people relate themselves by becoming ‘bua’ and ‘babua’. However, the relationships forged in the past have now been broken. People have made their mood that ‘na babua chahiye, na bua chahiye, UP me sirf ‘baba’ chahiye (neither babua nor bua is needed, UP needs only baba)”, said Rajnath while sharing the strategy of 30,286 booth in-charges and other office-bearers from 16 districts of Kashi region unit of BJP to counter the campaign of rivals at TD College ground here on Saturday. On Centre’s decision to repeal the three farm laws, Rajnath said that “the previous governments used to open fire on farmers to crush their movements, but the BJP has always been sensitive towards the farmers and that is why Prime Minister Narendra Modi is taking back these laws”. “BJP sees the farmers as ‘annadata’ (people who feed the country). We passed the three farm laws in the interest of the farmers. But, when a section of farmers continued to stir on the issue, the PM took the decision to repeal it. On the very first day of the forthcoming parliamentary session, the formality of repealing the laws would also be completed on the floor of the House. Everybody has seen how previous governments crushed the movements of farmers and even opened fire and rained canes on them. But, the BJP-led government has handled them decencently and politely,” he added. Targeting the SP chief for taking credit for Jewar Airport, Rajnath taunted, “Some people are not scared even of God in their bid to take credit of others’ work and claim that others are cutting ribbons of their work. It is on record that when I was CM of UP in 2001, I had forwarded the proposal of Jewar Airport. Neither the SP nor BSP government could go ahead to actualise the project.” “Except the regime of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the history of all other governments is full of scams and corruption. A former PM Rajiv Gandhi had expressed helplessness in putting a check on corrupt practices. There should be a clear intention to check corruption. BJP has shown how the country is governed by putting a check on corruption.” “How weak were Congress-led government is being exposed by its own senior leaders like Manish Tiwari, who in his recent book has mentioned that no desired action was taken against Pakistan after 26/11 terror attack on Mumbai,” said Rajnath. He added, “After Uri and Balakot terror attacks, India proved that it can also teach lessons to the perpetrators by crossing over the border.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/state-wants-only-baba-not-bua-or-babua-says-rajnath/articleshow/87955324.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

The boy and his mother also turned hostile in court. “The FSL report is only speaking that pornographic material is there, vulgar material is there, but what its exact nature has not been brought before the court by the prosecution by bringing at least any hard copy of it, so evidence of the prosecution is lacking in all material aspects. It is dislinking evidence, doubtful and insufficient evidence,” special judge HC Shende said. The court also pointed out that according to the cops the phone was sent to the lab on January 7, 2019, it was only received by them two days later. “Then, in whose custody these mobile phones were lying from January 7-9, 2019... So the possibility of tampering is there. The carrier was also not examined to throw light on this question,” the court said. It also found that the IEMI number was overwritten in the letter accompanying the phone to the forensic lab. The investigating officer told the court that he had not done it. The court said, “Therefore, appears probable that some tampering has been made in the muddemal (material evidence).” The court said that since the boy and his mother denied giving any information to the police and doctors, it would be unjust to conclude that the offences are proved. The accused was arrested in December 2018 and his bail pleas were rejected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-3-years-in-jail-bizman-acquitted-in-sex-assault-case/articleshow/87955331.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Mumbai Taximen’s Union leader A L Quadros said he is petitioning the government to either roll back the hefty CNG rates, hiked by around Rs 14 a kg in the past 10 months, or give drivers a fare hike. “However, this fare hike was based on a calculation in which fuel cost was taken as lower than Rs 50 a kg. Now, fuel cost has shot up over Rs 60. Drivers are already impacted by the pandemic in which business is slack. Now with fuel cost rising, it will only reduce their earnings and add to their woes,” he said. K K Tiwari of Taxi Rickshaw cell Mumbai BJP, said it was not just kaali-peeli taxi drivers, but also over 2 lakh auto drivers who were suffering due to CNG hikes. “We had a meeting... Many are willing to protest to demand rollback in CNG rates or a hike in fares,” he said. —Somit Sen||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cng-prices-up-taxi-and-auto-drivers-want-fare-hike/articleshow/87955337.cms||Somit Sen

Inaugurating the review meeting of government officials and people’s representatives on increasing tribal infant deaths due to malnutrition and sickle cell anemia of tribal women in Attapadi, the minister said, “More facilities will be added to the tribal specialty hospital at Kottathara. The shortage of doctors and paramedical staff will be resolved. The tribal welfare department will provide the required funds. An ICU for children will be started.” “To provide nutritious food to the tribal population, the millet village programme now implemented in nearly 70 tribal hamlets will be extended to all 192 tribal settlements,” he added. The meeting was attended by MP VK Sreekandan, MLA N Shamsudeen, district panchayat president K Binumol, Ottapalam sub-collector Shikha Surendran, district medical officer Dr KP Reetha, among others. But most tribespeople are not enthused by the minister’s declarations that they will be made self-reliant in two years. A leading tribal activist KA Ramu said, “Governments have been making failed promises again and again. They are not addressing the basic issues that led to the continuing infant deaths, malnutrition, sickle cell anemia, etc. The most important issue is the alienation of over 10,000 acre of tribal land in Attapadi. Once they lost their fertile land to the settlers, they lost their livelihood. Government has not taken any step to restore the alienated tribal land.” “The government also failed to implement the Forest Rights Act that would have helped the tribespeople regain some of their lost land. After assuming office in May 2017, the previous LDF government had promised that no more infants would die in Attapadi. But it failed in its promise and there is an alarming increase in tribal infant death,” Ramu added. “Despite the development of medical infrastructure facilities, tribal infant deaths and malnutrition among tribal mothers remain a major problem in Attapadi,” said Rajendra Prasad, president of ‘Thampu’ a tribal NGO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/attapadi-tribes-will-be-made-self-reliant-says-minister/articleshow/87954786.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Small portions of money spent on diesel and petrol were used in anti-India activities and our money was being used against us. When farmers will be happy, prosperity will come. With ethanol plants, more job opportunities will be created for youth,” said the CM. He further said that better connectivity is required for the plant and the investment in the area will open the gate to employment opportunities and business. Speaking on the occasion, CM Yogi again raised the Jinnah issue while criticizing opposition and said that before 2017, the governments used to take back cases against the terrorists attacking the Ramjanmanhoomi in Ayodhaya. These people are rioters and followers of Jinnah and they won’t be able to understand the sweetness of sugarcane. “Since the BJP came to power in the state, festivals were celebrated peacefully and even Covid was defeated. This is the picture of new Uttar Pradesh and we made the state riot free as not even a single riot has taken place in the last 4 years. BJP killed the terrorists after entering their den,” he said.  He said, “Congress, Bua (BSP) and Babua (SP) got enough chances to do development but earlier very less work was done for development. During 4 .5 years only in Gonda, we provided PM Awas to 42,000 people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/foundation-of-asias-biggest-ethanol-unit-laid-in-gonda-dist/articleshow/87955333.cms||Arjumand Bano

He said this after inaugurating a slew of projects at AmulFed Dairy. Shah said development models are a subject of serious studies, but many pundits have faltered in prescribing the right model for India. “Our PM realized when he was the Gujarat CM that if there is one model which can benefit all people, it is the cooperation-based model,” Shah said. “That is why the PM has started the cooperation ministry.” Shah said: “It is not easy to take the benefits of development to all sections of society in a country with a population of 130 crore.” Shah added: “A number of development models have been proposed. Some are suitable for countries with 2 crore or 10 crore population.” Shah said that the cooperation model of economic development is not new to Gujarat. “What started as a movement against exploitation has today become a movement of 36 lakh members of Amul, which is Gujarat’s pride,” he said. Commenting on the formation of the Union cooperation ministry, Shah said: “Many people were skeptical and asked what was the point in creating this ministry.” He said: “For me though, it is a matter of pride that I am the country’s first cooperation minister. This ministry has the potential to accelerate development and make people economically strong.” Shah said Amul has strengthened its core. “The procurement by 36 lakh dairy farmers, processing of milk and milk products, and marketing of the final products to lakhs of consumers are the three pillars of Amul,” he said. “It has strengthened all three pillars with these new projects.” He described Amul as the prime example of success of the cooperation model and women empowerment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/modi-picked-cooperation-model-shah/articleshow/87968007.cms||---

The NGO has put forward a number of measures to be implemented by the state government in order to address the plaguing issue, which is taking a severe toll on the tribespeople in Attapadi. It said the infant deaths in Attapadi is not only a medical issue faced by the tribespeople but also the fallout of a decade-long deprivation of land and degradation, the NGO said in the memorandum. In the first phase to address the infant deaths, it recommended financial aid under Janani Janmaraksha scheme and payment of arrears. It also recommended monthly publishing of growth monitoring chart and data of kids till six years old and pregnant women. Extending financial aid to those who could not take up any work in the last six months due to Covid was another measure suggested. The other recommendations include setting up a tribal industrial park, constituting a commission to study the land problems of tribespeople, implementing Forest Rights Act in its full spirit and constituting a committee comprising tribespeople to study how much the Act was implemented in tribal areas and whether it has helped to upgrade the living conditions of the tribespeople. Further steps should be based on the study report. It said that the development works to the tune of Rs 490 crore implemented in Attapadi following the infant deaths in 2013-14 should be subjected to social auditing. The organization has also put forward 35 other recommendations for improving scheduled castes in various sectors. In order to retain the financial, cultural and traditional values, the tribal areas should be brought under the Panchayat (Extension of the Scheduled Areas) Act 1996, and novel projects for collection and sale of forest products should be formulated.

The 12 page report has included images to depict the poor facilities, infrastructure and condition of cages where dogs are kept for sterilisation. The report points out that the centre is ill-equipped and refers to the conditions as harsh and inhumane. The Amicus Curiae report is severely critical of the cages in which the dogs are housed in the centre and attributed the pitiable facilities in the centre to unconcerned attitude of authorities concerned and lack of compassion. Despite recording the fatality of dogs in the centre, an autopsy is never conducted at the centre, according to the report. “The centre is totally ill-equipped to perform the task it is expected to. The dogs are unable to even stand up in the cages because their feet fall through the mesh and they have to balance themselves from falling through the wide gaps on the floor. These harsh conditions could have been alleviated by placing a tin sheet or a wooden plank or even a rubber mat on the floor of these cages. Unfortunately, the authorities are unconcerned and show least compassion,’ the report notes. The casualty rate at the centre was reported as 3-5 dogs out of 100 however none of these were ever subjected to autopsy which goes against relevant section of SoP for sterilization under ABC programme. As per the SoP, any dog that dies at ABC has to be subjected to autopsy. Lack of isolation space for sick dogs and empty rack for medicines are also cited in the report and are substantiated with images. The report says that the dogs are handled in a very mechanical way and their nature and attitude do not meet the standards expected of them. Suresh Menon, the Amicus Curiae said the inhumane way in which dogs are caged was appalling. “No authority should do such a thing. Even a single dog cannot stand on its feet in that cage. These kinds of things could have easily come to the notice of authorities concerned, but there was an evident lack of interest, compassion and commitment,”said Suresh Menon. The report also throws contradictions on the actual number of surgeries and dogs being housed in cages in the centre. The corporation authorities told him that the centre can handle 10 surgeries a day and that the same number of surgeries were being done daily. It was also communicated by the authorities that the corporation staff caught 10 dogs per day and after surgery they were released at the place from which they were captured. Verification of record books for October and September however proved a mismatch in number, the report points out. “Even if only 10 dogs are captured and 10 surgeries are performed everyday, the record books revealed that a dog brought in on a particular day was subjected to surgery only after 10 days. A dog which has undergone surgery has to be retained at the centre for at least 5 days for the wounds to heal and they become fit enough to be released. This means that a dog brought into the centre will be there for not less than 15 days and if 10 dogs are brought every day, the cages would be cramped, which corroborates the allegations of animal lovers,” the report says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/abc-project-amicus-curiae-report-to-hc-puts-corporation-in-the-dock/articleshow/87938044.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Pune||Theatres in Pune can run at 100% capacity from December 1, says Ajit Pawar||PUNE: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Saturday allowed theatres and auditoriums in the district to operate at 100% capacity following all Covid protocols from December 1, besides giving a goahead to cultural events on open grounds such as Sawai Gandharva music festival and Bhimtadi Jatra next month at the Covid review meeting. Ajit Pawar, who is also Pune’s guardian minister, decided to do away with the 50% occupancy restrictions on cinema halls and auditoriums after assessing the local level situation. The district’s latest weekly positivity rate (WPR) was around 2%. Later in the day, the state government issued orders in the light of the emergence of the new variant and restricted the attendance at theatres, cinemas, wedding halls and enclosed places to 50% of their capacity. The District Disaster Management Authorities (DDMAs) concerned have the authority to decide on the functioning capacity of these venues, though. Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar said he would discuss the implications of the state orders with the deputy chief minister before issuing the final order for the civic limits. In the review meeting, Ajit Pawar said scientists and experts were in favour of some restrictions on international travel after the emergence of the Omicron variant. “The Centre will issue these guidelines and the state will follow them. Without doubt, we need some restrictions on international flights coming from the places of concern, especially South Africa,” he said. The deputy chief minister said the mandatory check of RT-PCR report of the fully vaccinated people on return to Pune in domestic flights would be withdrawn because it was being scrutinised at the time of boarding the planes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dy-cm-theatres-in-pune-can-run-at-100-capacity-from-dec-1/articleshow/87954789.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Vijayawada||AP: School dropout farmer introduces ‘air layering’ for tree propagation||RAJAHMUNDRY: A high school dropout nursery farmer has introduced a new method of grafting that uses no soil. He relied on WhatsApp to get tips from his friends in Thailand where the method is very popular. The technique is also in vogue in southeastern Asian countries like Philippines, Vietnam and China.  ‘Air layering’ is a method of propagating new trees and shrubs from stems still attached to the parent plant. In this method, grafting will be done on branches. When the tree grows up to five years, grafting will be done and it will be kept for about 150 days. Later, the removed plant will be placed in a mix of cocopeat, vermicompost, grain husk and fly ash instead of soil for another 150 days. Then it will be sold, and the grafted stem will be as old as the original tree. Kuppala Durga Rao, a nursery farmer from Kadiyam Savaram under Kadiyam mandal in East Godavari district has introduced this innovative technique in the region. Discontinuing education after class 8, he started thinking innovatively. He visited Thailand four times and met some farmers there who were using air layering method in grafting. He continued interacting with them on WhatsApp and started applying the new method in his nursery - Saptagiri Nursery. Talking to the TOI, Durga Rao said he does not use soil at any stage in order to conserve soil. He said it is easy to transport plants which are propagated through air layering method as the weight is three times lighter compared to those propagated using soil. He is propagating mango and guava now and gets double the price than normal plants. Rao said it is easy to transport plants which are propagated through air layering method as the weight is three times lighter compared to those propagated using soil He added the age of the plant will be the same as mother block.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/school-dropout-farmer-introduces-air-layering-for-tree-propagation/articleshow/87954274.cms||Samson Raj

India’s first specialised urban farming fair is being organised in Thayagaraj Stadium, INA, Delhi, on November 27-28 to start a movement towards mass adoption of urban farming in the capital. The expo includes sessions on the new frontiers of urban agriculture, its associated technical horti-engineering, business, economic, social and environmental aspects. Sisodia said that the expo is being organised with the futuristic vision of bringing a new revolution of urban farming in Delhi to reach every rooftop and balcony in Delhi. The adoption of urban farming is the need of the hour to ensure food quality and security and to ensure every person can experience the joy of farming from their homes. The deputy CM said, “Every person’s life is led through agriculture, so we are all ‘Krishijeevi’ in that sense. In villages, agriculture and social media co-exist, but in urban areas, people are more dependent on social media and tend to forget the role of farmers in sustaining us through the year.” He said, “Around 400 - 500 orientation workshops will be organised in various areas of the capital over the next few months in partnership with Delhi government, and those interested can be inducted for a week-long training where they will be further made aware about the outlook, technology and latest trends in urban farming.” Vice-chairperson DDC Jasmine Shah said that urban farming has emerged as a booming industry in cities like London, Singapore, etc. He noted that despite curiosity for the same, urban farming in India has remained an elite concept and has not gained enough prominence among common people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/urban-farming-expo-in-city-to-teach-latest-trends/articleshow/87955369.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Rare European duck sighted in UP wetland||LUCKNOW: A chirpy news for bird watchers in north India. The rare fish-eating European duck, called Smew, has been sighted in the Haiderpur wetland in UP’s Muzaffarnagar district. The camera lens of avid bird watchers, Ashish Loya and Ashish Gujjar, captured a female smew duck wading through a group of tufted ducks last week. The duo notified it on Saturday. “This is the second sighting of the rare duck in the same area. I had sighted a male Smew in January this year. This makes two sightings in subsequent seasons and means that the rare bird could have chosen UP as its preferred winter home,” claimed Ashish Loya, who has been exploring the Haiderpur flora and fauna since 2014. Ashish Gujjar is an apprentice under Loya and works as a naturalist at the wetland. The two visit the place almost daily. Smew, which is predominantly an European species, travels to different regions of the world for breeding. Its sighting in India, especially in NCR and adjoining areas is rare. Prior to Haiderpur, the smew was sighted in Jhajjhar district of Haryana in 2014. Known for its cracked ice and panda-like appearance, Smew is described as a ‘monochrome winged beauty in motion’. In the book Waterfowl: an identification guide to the ducks, geese, and swans of the world (1988), one finds a detailed description about it: “The females and immature males are grey birds with chestnut foreheads and crowns and can be confused at a distance with the ruddy duck; they are often known as “redhead” smew. It has oval white wing-patches in flight. The smew’s bill has a hooked tip and serrated edges, which help it catch fish when it dives for them”. Haiderpur wetland owes its natural genesis to the confluence of the Ganga and the Solani rivers that happened when the Bijnore barrage was built. It was officially declared a wetland in 2019 and tourism development was undertaken by the Muzaffarnagar Development Authority under the then divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar (now posted as secretary finance, UP). Barely three hours away from Delhi, Haiderpur was opened for visitors in November 2019. The backwater wetland is spread over 18,000 acres and receives more than 50,000 migratory birds during winter. It is frequented by bird-watchers from across India. The official bird species count here has risen from 172 in 2019 to 324 at present. And the sighting of Smew is expected to draw more bird lovers and tourists to Haiderpur. IAS officer Sanjay Kumar, an avid bird watcher and writer, told TOI that Haiderpur is a unique natural beauty. “In addition to birds, the wetland is home to endangered species like Smooth Coated Otters, Swamp deer, Fishing cat, Gangetic dolphins and gharial. It is also reported to have the biggest stock of Greylag goose and Bar Headed goose in one single wetland in India – with a population of each being 4,000. In June 2021, a large herd of Swamp Deer (State animal of UP) — over 150 in numbers — was spotted here,” he said. Haiderpur is smew’s new home in India A rarely sighted duck (scientific name Mergellus Albellus) belonging to the Mergus family, smew has been dubbed as one of the most beautiful ducks in the world in several ornithology listings. Predominantly a European specie, it is a rare winter visitor to India. AO Hume, the father of Indian Ornithology, has recorded sighting this bird in 1881 in Najafgarh jheel area which is evident from his notes often quoted by bird-watchers and documenters. Bird watchers say that smew was spotted in New Delhi-NCR region in the 1920s and in Jhajjhar in 2014. In UP, a single male smew was first seen in Haiderpur wetland of Muzaffarnagar district in January 2021 by Ashish Loya who was lucky to find a female hidden amid a group of tufted ducks again last week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rare-european-duck-sighted-in-up-wetland/articleshow/87955345.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Man held for harassing woman with lewd texts||MUMBAI: A labourer was arrested by the Mumbai Central GRP on Friday for repeatedly sending messages with pornographic content to a young woman and harassing her to get in touch with him. Police are probing if the accused, Milan Yadav, had similarly texted nudes to other unsuspecting women as well. The 24-year-old complainant lives in south Mumbai. On November 5, she and her family were headed to Rajasthan on a pilgrimage. They were waiting at Dadar Terminus to board a long-distance train. Around 11.50am, the woman received a phone call from an unknown number. When she answered, a man on the other end asked her to check her WhatsApp messages. The complainant enquired who he was but he did not respond and hung up. “When the complainant checked her phone, she found images and videos with pornographic content. She was taken aback but as her family was with her, she stayed mum. The sender asked her to make a video call but she did not do so,” a police officer said. The next day, the woman once again received lewd messages on her phone. This time the woman replied that if he did not stop harassing her, she would approach the cops. The sender then stopped messaging. After returning from the pilgrimage, the woman approached the VP Road police station with a complaint. The case was transferred to the Mumbai Central GRP. Using technical surveillance methods, police found his location and picked him up on Friday. Yadav, (27) lives in Vasai. Yadav told the police he was not acquainted with the complainant and randomly dialled her number. “He has deleted all messages and obscene content from his phone. We have sent the phone for forensic analysis which will establish whether he sent lewd images and videos to other women as well,” said senior inspector Mehboob Inamdar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-held-for-harassing-woman-with-lewd-texts/articleshow/87955341.cms||---

C Gnanaraj Jebasingh, 39, son of former labour minister S T Chellapandian (in the 2011-2016 J Jayalalithaa cabinet), and the others were arrested by Tuticorin rural police. The truck carrying cashew nuts worth Rs 1.2 crore, started from a factory in Killiyoor, Kanyakumari around 9.30 pm on Thursday with V Hari at the wheel.

They beat up the driver and abducted him at knife point in their vehicle while three from the gang drove the container. Around 6 am, the lorry owner realised that the vehicle has been stolen and rushed to the Pudukottai police in Tuticorin to complain. “Going through CCTV footage in six cameras from Vasavapuram to Tuticorin, we saw an orange colour vehicle following the lorry,” the ASP said. After searching on many routes the police found around 9.45 am that the two vehicles crossed Kayathar toll plaza on the Kanyakumari - Bangalore NH by 2.40 am. “We got the registration number of the gang’s vehicle (TN-69-BL-5555) but were seven hours behind them. The MUV crossed Sattur toll plaza two hours later but the truck could not be found,” the officer said. The police found that the truck’s company name board was painted and the registration number changed from TN-04-AK-4710 to TN-64-AK-4719 and FasTag sticker removed. Hari was abandoned at Karur, but police managed to trace the vehicle till Paramathi Velur toll plaza in Namakkal district after which it went off the NH. Finally, tracking the mobile tower location of Jebasingh, who they identified as the owner of the MUV, police caught up with them at an eatery in Namakkal.

Realising the need for equipping this hospital more to meet any eventuality, a non-profit organisation ‘Rise Up Forum’ has come forward in supporting this hospital. One among the general wards of this hospital - Ward-11 - has been renovated by this organisation with 44 beds of this ward getting connected to the oxygen pipes individually and adding more infrastructure facilities to equip monitors and other emergency medical equipment near the beds itself. It took almost one month for the renovations to complete. The Rise up Forum is an NGO formed in 2018 when the state was hit with the floods. The forum has raised a fund of more than Rs 7 lakhs for this renovation purpose and it was raised by crowdfunding. The NGO also received donations from the Sunday friend’s organisation and Yogoda Satsanga Society India. “We planned to raise funds for upgrading government hospitals because it is the only shelter for common people to access basic health care. We are looking forward to serving the people who are in need of these facilities and this was our pilot project,” said Heshikesh, general secretary of Rise Up Forum. The Rise up Forumhad also come up with Covid War Room (a digital platform) during the peak of the pandemic providing support to the needy. “It was the time when almost every essential medical equipment, including oxygen beds, ventilators, medicines and oxygen concentrators went into shortage. Through this platform, they were able to deliver the information on availability of these equipment to hundreds of people across the country. This platform also helped them to provide the essential medicines for the people in need,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ngo-gives-a-facelift-to-general-hospital/articleshow/87938052.cms||---

They also wanted more to be done to help create awareness of dalit rights in the state.Senior advocate Jayna Kothari, advocate B B Mohan, film director and activist Gopi Nainar, and writer Jayarani were among the panelists at the public hearing. A total of 16 cases were taken up, which were mainly those involving caste-related violence and killings, honour killings and sexual violence. Family members of victims of the cases came forward to state what happened and how they have been affected. Legal course of action was also recommended by the panelists to them.A Kathir, executive director of Evidence, said that the panelists have come up with various recommendations to be given to the state government based on the findings. “There is a need to have a separate act that would ensure freedom of marriage between different castes. There are also various gaps everywhere in the government systems, including police, judiciary, hospitals and district administrations. The faith of people in the justice system is dwindling,” he said. Stating that only around 1200 SC, ST Act cases are being registered per year in the state and the conviction rate is also less, he added that the state must scrutinize the mechanisms that are in place to ensure monitoring of SC/ST Act cases at district level.“My son suffered a gruesome death just because he was in love with a girl from a higher caste. The girl’s family members killed him But, now the accused are out on bail and even 10 months after the murder, the chargesheet has not been filed,” said the father of a victim from Karur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/scrutinize-sc/st-act-cases-at-dist-level/articleshow/87954791.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The tunnel as well as the approach roads have been witnessing traffic snarls after two-way traffic was introduced through the tunnel two days ago, the minister said. He said Thrissur collector has been directed to convene a meeting of the collectors of Ernakulam and Palakkad districts to explore the possibilities of restricting the movements of cargo trucks. Even though the flow of traffic was smooth in the initial hours of the introduction of two-way traffic through the tunnel on Thursday, the situation turned for the worse on the night itself. Only traffic towards Thrissur from Palakkad, was permitted through the completed tunnel till Wednesday, while vehicles going to Palakkad were passing through the pre-existing road. This road will have to be demolished for the construction of the approach road to the second tunnel which is under final stages of construction. Rajan said other steps will also be taken to ease the traffic blocks in the tunnel area. He said the second tunnel is likely to be opened early next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kuthiran-tunnel-ban-on-trucks-likely-to-ease-traffic/articleshow/87954806.cms||T Ramavarman

As a result, the weightage in exam papers for descriptive questions will now be reduced to 70% instead of 80% earlier, said sources. The change is not applicable for Class 12 science students where 50 marks weightage for MCQ questions and 50 marks for descriptive questions in exams will continue. The decision was taken on Saturday by state education minister Jitu Vaghani after consulting chief minister Bhupendra Patel. The decision is expected to benefit about 30 lakh students of Class 9 to Class 12 in Gujarat and has been taken in view of competitive entrance exams like JEE and NEET where a similar question pattern is followed. In the past, a similar question paper pattern with 70:30 weightage where 70% was for descriptive and 30% was for MCQ type questions was being followed but it was discontinued few years ago, said sources. “The government has taken the decision amid Covid-19 where in-person classroom education got disrupted for over a year, resulting in learning loss for many students,” said sources. The decision comes at a time when board exams are only few months away. “Students have already completed half of their academic session. Such decisions are to be taken well in advance,” said an academic expert. The state education department has been taking key decisions in lines with the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). Recently, CBSE announced reduction in school syllabus by 30% for the academic year 2021-22. “There have been many representations both from schools and parents for reduction in state board syllabus. But the government has so far announced nothing in this direction,” said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mcq-weightage-up-for-std-9-12-exams/articleshow/87954824.cms||---

The Palladam police said 37-year-old K Ravichandran, a grade-I police constable from Astalakshmi Nagar on Mangalam Road, had incurred huge losses on online rummy game and he was on the run, while they had managed to nab the other two accused. Police have formed a special team to arrest Ravichandran, who was attached to Mangalam police station. An investigation officer said 51-year-old N Meenakshi Sundaram, assistant treasury officer with Palladam sub-treasury office, had lodged a complaint with them on November 8, stating unidentified people had broken into the office and attempted to break open the strong room lock on the night of November 7. Based on the treasury officer’s complaint, police registered a case and arrested 35-year-old Boobalan, younger brother of Ravichandran, on November 21, and 37-year-old Senthilkumar, of Paruthikadu near Poovanur in Salem district on November 23. The officer said Boobalan was running a vegetable shop on Market Street in Salem and Senthilkumar was his employee. Preliminary inquiry revealed that Ravichandran had hatched the conspiracy with his younger brother and Senthilkumar to burgle the sub-treasury office, as he was in huge debt. “They were not able to break open the strong room lock and had to return empty-handed. Ravichandran, meanwhile, stopped reporting for duty from November 20 and went into hiding,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cop-tries-to-burgle-treasury-suspended/articleshow/87954801.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal urges PM Modi to ban flights to stop new Covid variant, LG presses alert button||NEW DELHI: Amid growing concerns about mutated coronavirus variant, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal urged PM Narendra Modi on Saturday to stop flights from countries affected by the wave of infections, while lieutenant governor Anil Baijal directed the chief secretary and the Delhi Police commissioner to strictly enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour in public places and at events besides putting hospitals on full alert and preparedness to handle any emergency. Delhi Disaster Management Authority is likely to soon announce RT-PCR testing of passengers arriving on international flights and quarantining those coming from the Omicron-affected South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Israel and Hong Kong, among others. There still is no certainty about the virulence of the new variant, but many countries have already announced travel restrictions. Kejriwal tweeted, “I urge PM to stop flights from those countries which are affected by new variant. With great difficulty, our country has recovered from corona. We should do everything possible to prevent this new variant from entering India.” On Monday, at DDMA’s emergency meeting, to be chaired by the LG, the authorities are expected to learn from experts what preventive steps can be taken to keep Omicron at bay. Representatives of the Civil Aviation Ministry are likely to join the meeting. After a harrowing April-May, the number of Covid cases and fatalities have gone down in Delhi. Despite the crowds in the markets and public places during the recently concluded festival season, there has been no surge. On Friday, there were only 23 new cases and the capital currently has around 300 active Covid cases. The good situation, however, has a flipside in that it has engendered complacency among the people. It is common now to find people without masks in public places and enforcement of Covid norms is also less stringent. “The Covid situation is under control in the capital and also in the rest of the country. There is no need to panic, but we must take all precautions and maintain the habit of masking that people have developed since the pandemic outbreak,” cautioned Dr Arun Gupta, president, Delhi Medical Council. After two waves of infections, Delhi government has created the infrastructure that it hopes will meet the demands in case of a third wave. Hospital infrastructure has been boosted with ICU beds, ventilators and oxygenated beds. These have been complemented by a robust home isolation system. The shortage of oxygen had been a huge setback in treating Covid cases in the last wave, and to make sure that such a situation does not arise again, the state government is installing 73 PSA oxygen plants in hospitals capable of producing 77.8 million tonnes of the gas. The plants are in the final phase of commissioning. Recently, the Delhi cabinet also approved Rs 1,544 crore for use under the ‘Emergency Covid Response Package’. This fund will be spent on enhancing testing and laboratory facilities, procuring supplies, mobilising additional human resources, increasing health facilities in the hospitals and managing Covid care centres to effectively fight the coronavirus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cm-urges-pm-to-ban-flights-to-stop-new-variant-lg-presses-alert-button/articleshow/87955375.cms||AlokKNMishra

The Gujarat government has referred the matter to the central government for guidance, even as PM Narendra Modi is scheduled to inaugurate the summit at Mahatma Mandir in Gandhinagar on January 10. Also, most departments of the Union government and heads of state and top global business leaders are expected to attend the meet. “The state government has referred the matter to GOI as the scenario has changed. The central government will take a final call in the matter, but the options being explored right now is a change in both scale as well as format of the VGGS 2022,” a top source in the state government said. Sources added, “It is certain that VGGS 2022 will not be called off or postponed. Since the PM will inaugurate the event, a number of heads of state are expected to attend and most departments of GOI will be jointly organising events of VGGS 2022, the central government will have to decide on the format of holding the event.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-shadow-over-vggs/articleshow/87954823.cms||Kapil Dave
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Muslim NGO opposes law against blasphemy||MUMBAI: The NGO Indian Muslims for Secular Democracy (IMSD) has opposed the “unconstitutional demand” of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) for an anti-blasphemy law in India. Convenor Javed Anand and co-convenor Firoze Mithiborewala said the statement has been signed by 400 secular citizens, a majority of whom are Muslims. Among them figure Javed Akhtar, Shabana Azmi, Naseeruddin Shah, Anand Patwardhan, Anjum Rajabali, Joy Sengupta, Shabnam Hashmi, Shama Zaidi, Teesta Setalvad and Zeenat Shoukatali. The signatories include social and political activists, lawyers, journalists, writers, poets, actors, film makers, businessmen, farmers, home makers and students. The statement reads, “We condemn the constant attempts by certain hate factories of Hindutva which are working overtime to demonise Islam and Muslims. However, in a secular state there can be no place for a law criminalising blasphemy. Muslims demanding such a law should instead take recourse of the already existing law against hate speech like Section 295 (A) of the Indian Penal Code.” “The experience of neighbouring countries shows that the anti-blasphemy law promotes fanaticism and seeks to silence even rational critical commentaries on religion. The Board cannot be unaware of the notorious blasphemy law in neighbouring Pakistan which is frequently misused to hound individuals from religious minorities and even fellow Muslims with sectarian and personal motives. According to the Minorities Association of Pakistan, between 1987 and 2021, 1,865 people have been charged under the blasphemy laws, with a significant spike in 2020. Bangladesh does not have a law against blasphemy but often misuses the same secular penal code of the British period – section 295(A) – to silence all critical comments on Islam in the name of blasphemy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-muslim-ngo-opposes-law-against-blasphemy/articleshow/87955380.cms||Bella Jaisinghani

The sub-registrar, Meena Prajapati, stated that on September 30 in Bopal a document for sale of house in Palash Residence was produced and the document for sale was valued for Rs 42 lakh. An e-stamp of Rs 2.06 lakh was produced during the registration of the document. The registration was done where Pratik Kadiya and Snehal Kadiya, both residents of Kadi, Mehsana, were the sellers. The purchasers were Dhruvang Mehta and Tamanna Mehta, both residents of Bharuch. After the endorsement of the document, the e-stamp certificate was entered for verification and the same did not get verified. The complainant stated that she then informed her superiors. A call was made to the advocate, Rahul Jaiswal, and he was asked from where he got the e-stamp. Jaiswal said that he had got the same from notary Manoj Patel. Jaiswal rushed to the office and presented a second e-stamp. The e-stamp was then sent to the deputy collector stamp duty. The complainant said the Stock Holding Corporation had decided to lodge an online application with Madhavpura police but the authorities were told to file the complaint at Sola police station. The complaint was lodged against Mehtas, Patel and Jaiswal under IPC Section 420 (cheating), 465 (punishment for forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will), 471 (using as genuine a forged) and 114 (abettor present when offence is committed).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/registration-with-fake-stamp-4-booked/articleshow/87954825.cms||---
---||Goa||Hearings in police station attack case begin||Panaji: The high court of Bombay at Goa has begun hearing the appeal in the 2008 case pertaining to the attack on the Panaji police station, in which Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate and his wife and revenue minister Jennifer Monserrate, are among the accused. Arguments in the case will continue on Monday. The high court in 2012 did not grant relief and did not quash criminal proceedings. Advocate Aires Rodrigues, in a recent letter petition to the high court, stated that the trial against the accused was stayed in 2014, and questioned the seven-year stay. In his letter, he pointed out that the Supreme Court had directed that criminal cases against politicians be fast-tracked. A morcha led by Monserrate, then the MLA of Taleigao, in February 2008 demanding the immediate release of a resident and known supporter who had allegedly been beaten up and falsely implicated by the cops, had turned violent. Monserrate, along with his supporters, had demanded the immediate transfer of the investigating officer. When the mob began clashing with the police and pelting stones, the main door of the police station had to be shut. The police consequently mounted a lathicharge and released tear gas. Several policemen and some protesters were injured. In retaliation, Monserrate’s house was damaged later in the evening. Monserrate, his wife, and the Panaji mayor were initially detained and later arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hearings-in-police-station-attack-case-begin/articleshow/87954839.cms||---

At present, classes are stopped by noon and online classes continue in the evening. At a high-level meeting convened by education minister V Sivankutty on Friday, this suggestion was put forward since there were widespread complaints about the non-completion of portions and the difficulties faced while continuing classes online. The department is of the view that online classes should be discontinued. It also found that around 90% of the children are coming to schools and Covid cases among schoolchildren have come down considerably after schools reopened. It has proposed that classes can be divided into two batches in each class and conducted thrice a week. Education minister had accepted the suggestion made by the officials but made it clear that the same has to be ratified by the chief minister too. The minister will submit the proposal to the chief minister and the same will be later discussed during Covid review meet. The approval of the health department is also required for extending school timings till evening. Plus One Seats: The meeting also decided to resolve the complaints that arose due to the lack of Plus One seats. It has been decided to sanction 50 more batches to tide over the problem. The department also found that there is a severe shortage of seats in Malappuram, Kozhikode and Palakkad when it came to Plus One.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/edu-dept-in-favour-of-extending-school-timings/articleshow/87938089.cms||---
---||Lucknow||UP polls will be fought between pro, anti-national forces: CM Yogi Adityanath||JAUNPUR: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has said that 2022 UP elections will be fought between pro and anti-national forces. While mobilising the booth presidents of Kashi region unit of BJP at TD College ground, Yogi said, “The coming 2022 polls in UP have become an attraction for the entire world. People are seeing how low the anti-BJP forces can go to polarise anti-India forces." "The contest is going to take place between pro- and anti-nationalists. It had also become clear when some people started comparing Sardar Patel, who united India, with a divisive Jinnah, who tried to insult India,” he said Asking the party cadres to win booths if they want to see bulldozers crushing mafia empire in the state, Yogi also asked the party’s grassroots workers to “send the opposition, which avoided going to the people during the hour of need in Covid-19 first and second waves, in home isolation forever”. “Before 2017, it was a fashion for the opposition to hit the faith and sentiment of people, fanning riots and implicate people associated with Hindu organisations and BJP in false cases,” Yogi said, adding, “However, cases lodged against terrorists were withdrawn.” The CM further said, “By allowing corruption to flourish, the development of the state was hampered and job opportunities for youths were robbed. In five years, the people who indulged in rioting, criminal activities, spreading anarchy and corruption are on the backfoot. The interests of farmers, youth, women and poor were protected in this period, which upset the opposition and compelled them to recall Jinnah.” Highlighting the achievements of his government, Yogi said, “In past, the mafia and criminals ran the abduction industry, committed crimes like loot, robbery, extortion and grabbed land fearlessly. But, today the bulldozers are rolling on their empires.” He highlighted how the vision and decision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not allow people to die of hunger during the pandemic, he said that the provision of free ration for people has been extended till the festival of Holi. Giving all credit to party workers for the victory in 2014 and 2019 parliamentary and 2017 assembly polls in UP, he asked them to get prepared for strengthening the party at each booth for the 2022 assembly election.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-polls-will-be-fought-between-pro-anti-national-forces-yogi/articleshow/87955377.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Delhi||Naib court leaves premises, judge says needs to be there till work for day over||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has flagged the issue of police attendants attached to court coming “unarmed” despite the security threat faced by courts in recent times. A naib court is a policeman who acts as a liaison between local police stations, jail authorities, and the court having the jurisdiction of a particular area. They maintain the register of summons issued or directions given to police officers connected to a case to ensure compliance of the court’s orders. In a recent order, additional sessions judge Sonu Agnihotri noted that the naib court attached to his court left premises without permission. On being inquired, he told the judge that he was not the personal security officer (PSO) of the court and that his duty ends with the additional public prosecutor. “The attitude of the prosecution naib court seems to be strange as till the court is functioning, there can be any requirement of services like delivery of any urgent order, etc. He has left the court,” the judge noted in a detailed order. “Let charter of duties of prosecution naib court be called and let it be clarified as to whether they are required to be present till court is functioning, as functioning in a criminal court has its own security requirements particularly in the scenario when the Supreme Court has also taken cognizance of security threat to judges. It is further pertinent to mention that despite earlier circulars issued by the police department, naib courts attend court unarmed,” the court observed. The sessions judge sought a report from the city police commissioner and deputy commissioner of police (south east) in this regard and kept the matter for December 8. “It appears that police officers of southeast district are not only failing to do their duties, but conscious effort is being made to not allow orders of this court to reach in the knowledge of superior authorities of Delhi Police,” the court noted. These directions were issued while dismissing an anticipatory bail plea of a man accused of stalking a girl after their breakup and creating various social media accounts to post her photos in order to defame her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/naib-court-leaves-premises-judge-says-needs-to-be-there-till-work-for-day-over/articleshow/87954859.cms||---

Neighbours had apparently alerted the cops to the party. A resident of the complex went to the flat in question and started recording a video. He is heard accusing the students of taking drugs as one of the girls is sleeping. Gandhinagar Police has become the complainant in the case and has arrested the 13 from the flat. Gandhinagar superintendent of police Mayur Chavda said no drugs were found at the flat. Two liquor bottles were recovered. He said that the residents had sent a complaint to the police control room, but no one came forward to formally file it. So police have become the complainant. The complaint stated that one of the 13 arrested was a resident of the society and had organized the party. The person who had taken the flat on rent was a native of Madhya Pradesh. Cops said that one student is a local and the rest are from Haryana, Rajasthan, Telangana, and Maharashtra among other states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/13-dental-students-held-in-gandhinagar/articleshow/87954829.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Uddhav Thackeray didn’t miss bus, but ride politically bumpy so far||MUMBAI: When NCP president Sharad Pawar was installing Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray as CM, his nephew Ajit quietly raised a banner of revolt and joined hands with BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis to form the government. That was two years ago. It was assumed Uddhav had missed the bus and a three-party government comprising Sena, NCP and Congress would not happen. But Pawar took on his nephew and ensured he returned to the party and was installed as deputy CM, with Uddhav as CM. Since then, it was believed the three-party government may collapse any moment. But though MVA’s performance has been dismal on the financial front, Thackeray thwarted BJP’s attempts to dislodge it. The MVA government completes two years on Sunday under the leadership of Pawar, who continues to be the remote control. For Uddhav the move was a tightrope walk as each party had its own agenda and at the same time, the responsibility to ensure smooth sailing. It was Thackeray’s bold decision to break old ties with BJP. “Three parties with ideological differences formed the government. There was never a crisis, we are adhering to the common minimum programme approved by Congress president Sonia Gandhi,’’ revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat, who was instrumental in government formation, said. On the financial front, adequate steps have not been taken for resource mobilization and reducing establishment costs. Debt burden, which stood at Rs 4.07 lakh crore in 2018-19, increased by Rs 2.08 lakh crore, while salary burden increased from Rs 80,206 crore to Rs 1.22 lakh crore. Owing to differences among MVA leaders, Uddhav has also been unable to form state-run boards and corporations, so discontent is brewing among lower-rung politicians. While the cost of tackling the Covid crisis was unprecedented, resource mobilization came to a halt as there was no production and industries were closed. On the political front too, it was difficult for Uddhav. On one hand, BJP was giving dates for dislodging the government, and on the other, Central agencies were initiating action against leaders of NCP, including Sharad Pawar, and Sena. In between, the Sachin Waze controversy erupted, and former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh accused then home minister Anil Deshmukh of setting a target of mobilizing Rs 100 crore. “Central agencies are targeting NCP and Sena leaders to destabilize the government. BJP is disturbed over MVA’s success in recent by-elections,’’ NCP’s Nawab Malik said. Fadnavis said it was not on the agenda of BJP to dislodge MVA, which had failed on all fronts. “MVA will collapse on its own due to intra-MVA problems,” Fadnavis said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-uddhav-didnt-miss-bus-but-ride-politically-bumpy-so-far/articleshow/87955398.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

In her complaint, she said that although she gave in to her husband’s financial demands, he had threatened to divorce her. Chandkheda police on Friday lodged a complaint under the Indian Penal Code’s sections 498A (husband or a relative of the husband subjecting a woman to cruelty), 294B (uttering obscenities), and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt). The woman told police she works as assistant engineer in Gandhinagar. She said that earlier she was a professor at a university where she met the man she married. He too was a professor at the university at the time. She stated that after marriage, she started living at her in-laws’ home in Gandhinagar. She said that her sister-in-law and brother-in-law started taunting her over domestic chores. She said that she informed her parents who asked her to come to Chandkheda. She and her husband shifted to her father’s flat. The woman said that in 2018 her husband got a student visa for Canada. She said that she was pressured to give Rs 2 lakh and then Rs 4.10 lakh for his fees. The woman went to Canada on leave without pay to meet her husband. She was forced to return to Gandhinagar by her in-laws. She said that when her mother contracted Covid, her in-laws did not allow her to tend to her mother. They apparently told her that her mother had lived her life and hence she should not worry. Later her father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, and sister-in-law told her that she would not be allowed to go to Canada and divorce was her only option. Her in-laws refused to give back 150 grams of gold which her father had gifted after marriage. The woman said that her in-laws asked her to get more money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pays-for-hubbys-studies-gets-cruelty/articleshow/87954828.cms||---

Police said one of the accused worked with the firm where the woman had opened her account. The accused forged a form and changed her details before transferring her shares to a dummy account. Police received a complaint at Daryaganj police station on November 23 from a woman. The complainant said that she had opened a trading account and depository participants to a firm on Ansari road and submitted KYC in 2017. On March 30, she logged into her account and found all her shareholdings missing. On contacting the firm, she discovered that her details had been fraudulently changed, and her email ID, phone number and address were modified. On March 19, the firm had received a courier envelope containing a modification request seemingly signed by her to update the mobile number and email id of the account. On March 24, all the stocks kept in DP Account were online transferred into another DP account held with Reliance Securities in the name of someone called Ajay Kumar. During the investigation, on the basis of details obtained from the bank as well as through technical surveillance, the accused person was identified as Ajay Kumar. He was later arrested and subjected to interrogation. Police said that it came to light that a man identified as Sukhdev, who was working in the same firm, passed on the relevant information of the complainant’s account to another accused, accused Bharat Bhushan.

---||Delhi||Delhi: 9 held for duping many on pretext of supplying O2 during second wave||NEW DELHI: A gang of nine who allegedly duped people on the pretext of providing them oxygen cylinders during the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic has been busted by the cyber cell of Delhi Police. A man looking for an oxygen cylinder for his Covid positive wife also was a victim of the fraud and his wife had eventually passed away. The gang operated in an organised manner and has so far duped more than 1,000 people of approximately Rs 1.5 crore, senior police officers said. The accused have been identified as Sarita Devi (36), Pinki Devi (37), Amit Roushan (27), Nitish Kumar (25), Sanu Nandi (24), Soumen Mondal (35), Utpal Ghosal (35), Pawan (26) and Kamal Kant (31). A total of nine mobile phones, a laptop, 11 SIM cards and seven ATM cards have been recovered from them. The cheating came to fore when one complainant, Vinod Kumar, told the police that when his wife was suffering from Covid-19 and needed an oxygen cylinder, he had contacted on a mobile number, which was circulated through social media platforms. “Kumar was asked to deposit Rs 25,000 in an account and was assured early delivery of the oxygen cylinder. But despite paying, he never got the cylinder. On his complaint, we investigated the matter and using technical surveillance and money trail, managed to identify the three accused who were arrested from different districts of Bihar,” deputy commissioner of police (cyber cell) KPS Malhotra said. Further, on their information, six more people were arrested from West Bengal and Bihar. “During questioning, the accused said that initially they used to circulate their phone numbers on social media promising home delivery of oxygen cylinders. On receiving calls, their tele-callers engaged with the customers and lured them to send money in advance to get early home delivery of oxygen cylinders,” the officer said. The accused circulated the money in various fake accounts to escape the police net.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/9-held-for-duping-many-on-pretext-of-supplying-o2-during-second-wave/articleshow/87955399.cms||---

Agarwal exhorted the participants to highlight the reasons to avoid single-use plastic, and suggest sustainable alternatives instead of single-use plastic. “Single-use plastic is hazardous to health and causes environmental degradation. The youth of our country is now coming forward to fight the menace of single-use plastic, and we are pinning our hopes on them to bring about change,” he said. During the rally, the participants enacted street plays, and held interaction sessions with locals at Begur and Gundlupet. The participants of the cycle rally aim to spread awareness about hygiene, perils of indiscriminate use of single-use plastic in rural, urban, forest areas and to remove vaccine hesitancy. At Bandipur, for the benefit of scouts and guides, the officers of the forest department held an awareness session about ‘Do’s and dont’s, followed by a nature study. Additional divisional railway manager (Mysuru division) and district chief commissioner A Devasahayam, ADRM-11 Budati Srinivasulu, district secretary and senior divisional personnel officer Prashanth Mastiholi, and senor DSTE D Sreenivasalu were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/cycle-rally-held-to-create-awareness-on-single-use-plastic/articleshow/87954251.cms||---

---||Mumbai||‘Disqualified’ LLB student declared ‘eligible’ by Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Bombay high court has directed a law college to hence forth bring to the notice of all applicants, during the beginning of the admission process, about the mandatory or discretionary eligibility criteria and that on its non-compliance “no admission would be granted under any circumstance”. The HC passed the order while however granting relief to one final year student of a three year LLB degree course observing that she was informed of her ineligible status very belatedly. The HC bench of Justices R D Dhanuka and Abhay Ahuja on November 25 directed a law college on Mira Road to apply for an eligibility certificate for the petitioner, a 37-year-old woman and permitted her to appear for her examination. The final year student had moved the HC to challenge her “disqualification” which her counsel Sandesh Patil said was communicated to her only when she was to appear for her fifth semester examination. She was told that since she didn’t have the requisite minimum percentage of marks in her qualifying degree examination she was not eligible for the law course.  After hearing the counsel for the college, Manorama Mohanty and advocate Manoj Paryani for Mumbai University, the HC held, “The petitioner is not at fault because of the non-communication on the part of the university or the college about such order passed by the university belatedly or by not considering the issue of eligibility at the threshold.” The HC said, “Since the petitioner was already allowed to appear for the CET examination and after passing was granted admission by the college, the university after lapse of substantial period and that also more particularly, the petitioner having passed 4 semesters out of 6 semesters could not have declared the petitioner ineligible by placing reliance on an eligibility clause.” In its order however, the HC reiterated that the exception has only been made for the facts of her case and would not be considered a precedent in any other matter for other students. The HC directed the university to declare her eligible within 48 hours for the final two semester examinations and permitted her to appear for the examinations. The university is to grant her eligibility certificate expeditiously too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/disqualified-llb-student-declared-eligible-by-bombay-hc/articleshow/87955409.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Goa||HC stays ore transport from Bandol, Santona||Panaji: The high court of Bombay at Goa granted ad-interim relief, staying operations of transportation of all minerals out of plots in Bandol and Santona villages pending final disposal of a public interest petition. The court stated that prima facie it appeared that Mineira Nationale Ltd applied for transportation of ROM material within the lease area. “As observed by the assistant geologist, sub-grade ROM material was lying partly inside the mining lease and partly outside the lease on the western side of the lease boundary. It is further stated that the total area covered under this material is approximately 28.2Ha, out of which, 5.2Ha is within the lease area. It thus appears from the said report that about 23ha falls outside the lease area,” the division bench stated. Advocate general Devidas Panagam submitted that the issue of the dump outside the leased area and not within the leased area is before the apex court. He submitted that therefore, the cabinet decision, as well as the opinion given by him, were in consonance with the said decision. He submitted that the authorities, whilst permitting the MNL to transport the ROM material from the dump site, were fully conscious of the decision of the apex court. Goa Foundation filed a public interest petition challenging the permits granted to Mineira Nationale Ltd for removal of 25 lakh tonnes (Rs 236 crore) of sub-grade materials from its former mining lease located at Cuddegal, Santona. Goa Foundation stated that a large number of complaints had been filed that minerals were being lifted out of the mining lease which belongs to Mineira National Ltd. MNL who had not operated the lease from 2012.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-stays-ore-transport-from-bandol-santona/articleshow/87954836.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The flea market will be held from 10 am to 5.30 pm till November 30. Televisions, toys, books, clothes and bags were received at the flea market on Friday. “There may be so many things in our house which may not be of use to us, but could be useful for others. Flea market offers a platform for exchange of such articles. The materials are being received and exchanged at the flea market free of cost,” said Vattiyoorkavu MLA V K Prasanth. He said that optimum usage of resources is the aim of the flea market and is a good example of humanity. A charity box has been installed in the flea market and interested persons can contribute. The youth brigade aims to source money from the charity box for the conduct of this programme. Green army and environmental organisation Thanal are cooperating with the initiative. Vattiyoorkavu youth brigade had recently organised a flea market at Sasthamangalam. It had featured an array of articles from musical instruments to toys, two wheelers to household equipment. Dresses, bags, earphones, helmets, teddy bears, mobile chargers, suitcases and shoes were also exchanged at the flea market held at Sasthamangalam. “People’s useless items might be a valuable resource for those in need. It is preferable to reuse items such as plastics and electronics in order to prevent pollution. Plastics and e-waste dumped in the ground might pollute the soil. This initiative aids us in reducing pollution. The items will be provided to the public at zero cost. We only accept materials in usable state and with minimal damage,” said the organisers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/youth-group-organises-flea-market-at-peroorkada/articleshow/87938116.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Alter Covid vaccine to fight new variant of concern, say experts||KOLKATA: The new variant of coronavirus detected in South Africa, termed B.1.1.529 or Omicron — which has been classified as a ‘variant of concern’ by the WHO — will necessitate a new vaccine to act as a shield against it, felt a section of experts in Kolkata. Being a combination of a far larger number of mutations that are different and more potent than what the existing vaccines are designed to stave off, Omicron will render them toothless, they feared. Like the influenza vaccine, which is altered every year, it is time to change the Covid vaccine as well, they argued. The initial reports on the variant are extremely worrying, especially since international air travel is opening up, said Peerless Hospital microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chowdhury. “It’s a cluster of mutations that are resistant to the existing Covid antibodies and are more transmissible than any of the mutations that we have seen. So, our vaccines will not work against it and this can spread faster than any of the earlier variants. We need to develop a vaccine against this as soon as possible,” said Chowdhury. He added that while other variants, too, have spread from South Africa, Omicron seemed to be a far more virulent one. South African studies have called Omicron ‘a very unusual constellation of mutations, more than 30 in the spike protein alone, 10 more at the ACE2 receptor’. It is believed to have ‘enhanced transmissibility’ and might be able to get around our immune system. The cat-and-mouse game between the virus and the vaccine will have to continue, said CMRI director of pulmonology Raja Dhar. “With every mutation of the virus, the existing vaccines will lose efficacy. So, vaccines must be dynamic and change every year, factoring in the extent of the mutation. This variant seems dangerous since it apparently has multiple mutations at the ACE 2 receptor where the antibodies generated by vaccines bind,” said Dhar. TimesViewThe news of this new strain comes at a time when we are in the reopening mode. Careful and responsible behaviour would be a better response to this variant of concern than panic.Even though Omicron has not yet affected a large number, it has already been detected in several African nations and even in Hong Kong. “This is indeed like a new virus since it has more than 30 mutations in the spike protein alone. If it spreads fast, we may have to think of altering the vaccine to neutralize Omicron or else the pandemic will flare up yet again. We still have a large section of unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated people who are vulnerable in any case. A dead virus vaccine like Covaxin, I believe, will be more effective against this variant than Covishield,” said Belle Vue Clinic internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain. Some, however, felt it could be too early to press the panic button. Rather, we should stick to Covid-appropriate behaviour and focus on completing vaccination, said RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) intensivist Sauren Panja. “Studies on Omicron are still at a nascent stage and let us wait to see if it’s indeed as virulent and transmissible as the first reports claim. It would be wrong to conclude now that the existing vaccines won’t work at all,” said Panja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/alter-cov-vaccine-to-fight-new-variant-of-concern-experts/articleshow/87954313.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Metro projects still on slow track but coastal road cruises ahead||MUMBAI: The two years of Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government have been a mixed bag for infrastructure projects as Metro projects lagged behind targets, while the other big-ticket Mumabai Coastal Road project executed by BMC has witnessed steady progress. The first Metro line was opened in Mumbai in June 2014 but it has been almost seven years and Mumbaikars are still awaiting the opening of the second one. A senior state government official said, “Pandemic played a major role in disrupting timelines as labour had rushed to their home states, and supply lines got disrupted because of the global nature of the crisis.” Metro 2A (DN Nagar-Dahisar) and 7 (Dahisar-Andheri via Western Express Highway), which were in advanced stages of completion a year ago, could be opened for commercial operations even though trials commenced on May 31. There has been no solution in sight for the depot for Metro 3 corridor and trials are slated to begin outside the depot in January 2022. RTI activist Anil Galgali said, “Covid has been an excuse to hide inefficiency in executing infrastructure projects. Contractors are not adhering to timelines as they know there will not be any action against them.” But the pet project of Sena has witnessed decent progress. Despite protests by fishermen in Worli, and some residents in South Mumbai and allegations of corruption by BJP, BMC’s coastal road is making steady progress. BMC is targeting completion of the 10km coastal road project between Nariman Point and Worli by December 2022 despite a five-month disruption last year. The Rs12,721-crore project was to be completed in four years since commencement of work in October 2018. But BJP MLA Ashish Shelar recently alleged irregularities of Rs 1,600 crore in project. BMC refuted the allegations. Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL) too witnessed steady progress as around 70% work on the crucial 22km link is completed. A senior official said, “In this term, there is also strong push for Sewri-Worli connector as Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray is taking keen interest in this project.” The 17km Versova-Bandra-Sea Link is lagging behind and Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation imposed a penalty on the contractor. The Rs55,000 crore Mumbai-Nagpur super communication highway will be fully completed in December 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-metro-projects-still-on-slow-track-but-coastal-road-cruises-ahead/articleshow/87955428.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Mentally disturbed woman suffers 50-feet fall with nine-year-old daughter in lap||Nagpur: Even after 24 hours, Amravati police are unsure about the reason behind the death of Tanushree Karluke, 29, who was undergoing psychiatric treatment. Tanushree succumbed to her injuries after she fell from a height of around 50 feet with her 10-month-old daughter Ketki who was lucky to survive with a fractured right thigh. It is still unclear if Tanushree ended life or it was an accident. Tanushree’s body was found behind an agricultural college near Panchvati in Amravati on Friday with the injured baby daughter beside her. Her four-year-old son, Rudra, was on the terrace of the college. Rudra was rescued by a security guard of the college and others after they heard his cries.The woman, who is learnt to be mentally disturbed, had left home at Ruikhairi in Buti Bori with two children at 2pm on Thursday. Her husband, Sagar, an autorickshaw driver, had registered a missing complaint at Buti Bori police station shortly after the midnight of Thursday. His wife’s body was identified after her body’s photograph along with that of their children started doing the rounds on social media. Police said Sagar, with whom she had tied the nuptial knot in 2016, has claimed not having any tiff with the wife. He admitted reprimanding his son for bringing a dirty plastic bottle from the road to home. Sagar had approached Buti Bori police after he came back home and didn’t find his wife and children. Amravati police have registered the case as accidental death. They are unsure as to how the woman reached Amravati covering a distance of more than 172 kms. The question as to how Tanushree and her two children went to the terrace of a closed college too has kept the Amravati cops on tenterhooks. SP Aarti Singh said the case would be probed from different angles. Senior inspector Asharam Chormale of Gadgenagar police station said there were signs that the woman and the two children had likely spent the night on the terrace. “We have found some human excreta on the terrace. The son too was on the terrace while the woman and the daughter had been on the ground behind the college,” said Charmole.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mentally-disturbed-woman-suffers-50-feet-fall-with-nine-year-old-daughter-in-lap/articleshow/87953193.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||India’s biggest urban development body in Jagan Mohan Reddy’s home turf||VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy’s native Kadapa is now the biggest urban development body in India. Spread over 12,780 sq km, Annamaiah urban development authority (UDA) that controls the urban areas of Kadapa district, is the first urban development body in the country to have an area over 9,000 sq kilometres. No urban, metropolitan or regional development authority in the country including Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai have such a large area. So far, the biggest urban development body was the AP Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA), that controls Amaravati area, but Kadapa has now overtaken it in terms of the geographic expanse. The state government issued orders including 520 villages spread over 41 mandals adding 7,388 sq km to Annamaiah UDA taking its over all area to 12,780 sq km. Jagan’s predecessor N Chandrababu Naidu created the country’s biggest urban agglomeration, APCRDA, to develop the proposed capital city Amaravati for the residuary Andhra Pradesh post-bifurcation. The APCRDA was created in 2016 with an area of over 7,000 square kilometres. However, the Jagan government had renamed it as Amaravati Metropolitan Development Authority expanding its area to 8,352 kilometres in 2020. But, after the withdrawal of the legislation on three capital cities, the APCRDA was restored. Though Annamaiah UDA has a vast geographic area, its urban planning and development of civic infrastructure largely depends on the revenue it generates or the funds it gets from the state government. Most of the civic bodies and UDAs are cash-strapped. Urban bodies are generally left to fend for themselves often affecting development programmes. However, Annamaiah UDA may not face any funds crunch as incidentally, Jagan had the other day said in the state Assembly that he had special love for his home district and would do anything to develop it. Already, Pulivendula, which is part of the Annamaiah UDA, has been receiving a lion’s share in development works. Pulivendula is represented by Jagan in the state assembly. AP had three UDAs before bifurcation - Visakhapatnam UDA, Tirupati UDA and Vijayawada-Guntur-Tenali UDA. Of these, Visakhapatnam UDA was the biggest with an area of 7,328.86 km. Jagan government created 12 UDAs in 2019. In the last two years, the government added more villages to the new UDAs and the latest is Annamaiah UDA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/indias-biggest-urban-development-body-in-jagans-home-turf/articleshow/87956077.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Kochi||Kerala: Dispute over unified Holy Mass intensifies||KOCHI: Syro Malabar Church’s decision to adopt a uniform mode for conducting the Holy Mass has hit a major roadblock as the metropolitan vicar of the Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese on Saturday issued a circular granting exemption to all cathedrals, parishes, and pilgrim centres under the archdiocese from changing the liturgical form. Major archbishop of the Church cardinal George Alencherry stated that he came to know about the dispensation from the media and called for a prompt implementation of the uniform mode as decided earlier. “Upholding the spiritual well being of the faithful and considering the serious issues relating to pastoral needs in the archdiocese, I, as the vicar of the major archbishop, grants dispensation, from the way of conducting mass (50:50) according to the synod’s decision, in all centres within the archdiocese as per canon 1538. I inform you that the congregation of oriental churches in Rome has empowered me to execute this dispensation on November 28 itself,” said the circular issued by metropolitan vicar, Mar Antony Kariyil. In the Syro-Malabar Church, various dioceses had been following different modes of celebrating the mass, an obvious difference being the priest facing the churchgoers during the ceremony in certain dioceses and facing the altar in certain other dioceses. The unified way is a combination of both, and it was set to come into effect from Sunday, November 28 onwards. “It has been known from the media that the metropolitan vicar has given dispensation to the Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese on the decision. I have not received any information relating to this from the Holy See,” said cardinal Alencherry in a circular. The archdiocese has, however, released a letter from the oriental congregation of the Holy See, reaffirming metropolitan vicar Mar Antony Kariyil’s authority to apply the dispensation. The letter says that it was issued after the archbishop met Pope Francis in Rome. “In virtue of your office as vicar of the Mar archbishop for the archeparchy of Ernakulam-Angamaly, your grace can apply the faculty of dispensation for those cases which in your prudential judgement would result in grave consequences, with the entry into force on November 28, 2021, the Synodal decisions concerning the Holy Qurbana,” the letter undersigned by cardinal Leonardo Sandri, the prefect of the congregation, says. Though cardinal Alencherry said he has not received any information relating to the dispensation from the Holy See, the Church has not yet formally challenged the validity of the dispensation either. It has been learnt that cardinal Alencherry would celebrate the Mass on Sunday the new way at the chapel in Mount St Thomas, the headquarters of the Church in Kakkanad. Archbishop of Changanassery diocese Joseph Perumthottam has written to the priests of churches under the diocese to implement the uniform way of conducting Mass as per the decision of the synod. A circular regarding this has been sent to the priests on Saturday. Sit-in protest against bishop: In Thrissur, a section of priests staged a sit-in protest against archbishop Mar Andrews Thazhath at the archdiocese headquarters, demanding that the existing mode of celebrating Mass be continued till the next Easter. In another development, Chalakkudy munsiff court has restrained the vicar of St Mary’s Forane church from making any changes in the way the Mass is conducted, until further orders. The priests who had gone to the archdiocese headquarters said the churches under Thrissur archdiocese should also be given exemption just like the Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese. The archbishop who refused to accede to their demand was blocked in his room for about half an hour. Later, he went out but the priests said they will continue their agitation till their demands are met. Irinjalakuda diocese invokes canon law: Irinjalakuda diocese has decided to permit the continuation of the existing way of celebrating the Mass in churches under the diocese. Bishop Mar Pauly Kannookkadan said the decision was taken by invoking Section 1538 of the canon law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/dispute-over-unified-mass-intensifies/articleshow/87954861.cms||---

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Weekends to take up many holidays next year||KOLKATA: The state government has released its list of holidays for next year, which makes it clear that though the Puja holidays were for 15 days in 2021, it is likely to be a closure for 11 days in 2022. Also, state government employees will miss a handful of holidays this time as a host of festivals are scheduled on weekends. According to the finance department’s November 26 order, the state government offices will remain closed between September 30 (Panchami) and October 10 (a day after Lakshmi Puja) for Puja holidays. For Kali Puja and Diwali, the state government offices will remain closed from October 24 (Monday) to October 26 (Wednesday) and for Bhatridwitiya on October 27 (Thursday). So there will be one working day on Friday (October 28) in that week. In 2022, Shashthi and Saptami are on October 1 and 2, which is a weekend. Again, Lakshmi Puja is on a Sunday. Similarly, many holidays are on weekends and thus government staffers will have less holidays. Since January 1 is a Saturday and Netaji’s birthday is also on a Sunday, they will miss two holidays in January. Again, Saraswati Puja is on February 5, which is a Saturday. Thus, another holiday will be lost in February. May Day and Id Ud Zoha — on July 10 — are on Sundays. Again, Mahalaya, on September 25, is a Sunday. So are Gandhiji’s birthday and Lakshmi Puja. Similarly, Chhath Puja — on October 30 — and Christmas are on Sundays. However, there will be a Chhath holiday on October 31. The first holiday of the year is on January 12 — Swamiji’s birthday — on Wednesday. Republic Day is also on Wednesday. With Holi being on March 18 – a Friday — government staffers can have an extended weekend. Similarly, there will be an extended weekend starting April 14 (Thursday) for Dr BR Ambedkar’s birthday and Mahavir Jayanti and on April 15 (Friday) for Poila Baisakh and Good Friday. There will be a four-day short vacation at a stretch. There would be holidays on May 3 (Tuesday) for Idul Fitr and on May 9 (Monday) for Tagore’s birthday, and again on May 16 (Monday) for Buddha Purnima. Thus, there would be two extended weekends in May. As Rathyatra is on July 1 (Friday), there will be another extended weekend and one can plan an outing. Muharram will be on August 9 (Tuesday). August 15 is a Monday and Janmashtami is a Friday (August 19). Thus, there will be three working days in the week and one can plan a short trip during the two weekends.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/weekends-to-take-up-many-holidays-next-yr/articleshow/87954335.cms||Debashis Konar

The expo fulfilled expectations of many buyers as it witnessed overwhelming response on the very first day. Over 45 builders set up 60 stalls in the two-day expo which is a one-stop shop for potential buyers looking for new houses. Buyers who thronged the expo were largely looking at properties that would be ready to occupy over the next two years. “For the past six years I have been living in a 2-BHK apartment in Manikonda. I wish to upgrade to a 3-BHK in the same locality. The idea behind visiting the expo was to check if I could find any projects in the neighbouring areas that are ready to occupy in the next two years,” said Mohsin Khan, an IT employee. While western corridor continued to be the most sought after choice for many home buyers, a few are also looking at properties in areas such as Kompally, Shamshabad among others. “The idea to visit the expo was to explore various properties in order get a feel of the market price. I could get all the information regarding different projects under one roof,” said Upender Reddy, a retired government employee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/two-day-times-property-expo-attracts-large-crowds/articleshow/87954334.cms||---

The wind speed remained calm towards the morning and the minimum temperature dropped by a degree Celsius. Though the wind speed picked up towards the afternoon, it was not enough to flush out the pollutants – mostly from local sources. The Air Quality Index (AQI) was 402 as against 406 a day earlier. Delhi continued to remain among four cities in the country that suffered a ‘severe’ air quality. Faridabad, Katihar and Siwan were the other three. According to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the contribution of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 reduced to 6% on Saturday from 8% on Friday. Track the pollution level in your cityThe smog and fog continued to dominate most of the city’s skyline obscuring the visibility to about 400 to 600 metres in the Safdarjung area, however, Palam had a better visibility due to better ventilation. According to weather analysts, the air quality may improve around November 29 with slightly better winds. They also said that no significant drop in the mercury shall be observed. “There are chances of some good winds for a few hours on November 29. Also, there will be two episodes of easterly winds on around December 2 and December 6. The easterly winds are warmer, so there will be no significant fall in the mercury till December 6 at least,” said RK Jenamani, senior weather scientist, India Meteorological Department. According to IMD, the city saw a slight drop in the mercury by a degree while the maximum temperature (27 degrees) remained the same. The city recorded a minimum temperature of 10.2 degrees as against 11 degrees on Saturday. “There was a slight increase in wind speed on Saturday at around 7-8 kmph at most of the places and up to 10 kmph at some places in the city. The meteorological conditions are likely to remain similar on Sunday but the wind speed may increase slightly on Monday leading to some dispersion of pollutants,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet. According to SAFAR, the AQI might improve slightly on Monday and Tuesday due to local surface winds but will remain within the upper end of very-poor levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aqi-severe-delhi-among-4-most-polluted-cities-again/articleshow/87954856.cms||Kushagra Dixit

Many buyers are planning to relocate here due to its affordability, quality of living and robust political scenario,” said Sandip Patnaik, managing director- JLL Telangana and AP. The demand, panellists said, is also propelled by growth in other sectors. “With more companies setting shop in Hyderabad, there is large-scale employment generation. That’s directly helping the realty sector,” said Nand Kishore, MD, Ramky Estates and Farms Ltd. Even the pandemic, in a way, has made real estate ‘the most desirable asset’ with people spending more time at home, said Samson Arthur, branch director (Hyderabad), Knight Frank. “Even millennials living in rented apartments are now buying houses,” he added.

Posing as ‘ISIS Kashmir’, he threatened to kill the MP and his family. Khan even attached a clip showing the exteriors of Gambhir's house, indicating that a reconnaissance had been carried out.  The emails sent the intelligence agencies and Delhi Police into a tizzy and police commissioner Rakesh Asthana pressed many teams into the investigation. The breakthrough was achieved by the newly formed Intelligence Fusion and Strategic Ops (IFSO) unit of the Special Cell. Its exhaustive deep-tech analysis of internet protocol details record revealed that the email ID ‘isiskashmir@gmail.com’ was created around 2pm on November 23 from IP address 119.160.2.77. When the cops dug deeper, they landed on four other email IDs active on this particular IP. The two prominent ones on the Gmail server were 'ishahidhameed' and 'theshahidhameed'.  The IP address was located to Karachi in Pakistan and the internet connection was that of a home broadband on a Redmi Note 8 phone device. Further technical analysis ruled out the use of proxy servers or virtual private networks. Shahid Khan, user of the IDs, turned out to be a University of Sindh student.  A scan of Khan’s online activities showed no apparent connection with ISIS or other terror outfits. All that the investigators could find was a downloaded/watched-on-OTT list of Indian movies, porn and purchases from online shopping portals. The video that Khan had attached to his email was found to have been downloaded from a YouTube channel called 'The Unique Zone'. It has been uploaded by a vlogger some time ago.  KPS Malhotra, DCP (IFSO), said, “The investigation is at an initial stage. We have leads and our teams are working on them.” Intelligence sources pointed out that the mails did not seem authentic because the Islamic State doesn’t send any communications prior to an attack but claimed responsibility if an attack proved successful. Commenting on a similar threat mail sent to another person, a police source added that IS didn't refer to itself as Daesh, a term used for the terror group to deprive it of the legitimacy that comes from using the term 'State'.  On Wednesday, security was beefed up at Gambhir’s house after a complaint was filed. “The complainant mentioned that they had received an email on the official email of MP Gambhir from ISIS Kashmir around 9.32pm. The mail mentioned death threats to the MP and his family,” said an officer. “The second email read: ‘We intended to kill you, but you survived yesterday...If you love the life of your family, stay away from politics and Kashmir issue.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-cell-traces-gambhir-threat-mail-to-pak-student/articleshow/87954862.cms||Raj Shekhar

A rescue operation was initiated by the Indian Coast Guard and no loss of life or marine pollution was reported, said coast guard officials. The Indian Coast Guard (ICG) said that it was continuously monitoring the area of collision for an oil spill. The collision between oil/chemical tanker MV Atlantic Grace and bulk carrier MV Aviator occurred around 21:30 hours on Friday in the area considered to be a very sensitive marine diversity reserve, the ICG said in a release.  Atlantic Grace, sailing under the flag of Hong Kong, was carrying oil and chemical containers. ICG ships from Mundra and Okha were deployed in the area to carry out the damage assessment. As the Okha and Dwarka coast have sensitive marine diversity reserves, a pollution control vessel of the coast guard ICGS Samudra Pavak was also pressed into action to assess oil spill, if any, and take preventive measures. A coast guard helicopter also carried out a pollution assessment, sources said. “Collision betwn MVs Aviator and Atlantic Grace in GoK on 26 November night. No casualties, oil slick reported. @IndianCoastGuard Ships in the area incl. Pollution Control stand-by in vicinity & monitoring the situation,” the Gujarat defence public relations officer had said in a tweet. Port officials said that no oil spill was reported from any of the merchant ships. “There is no loss of life and there is no report of marine pollution because of this collision,” Niraj Hiravani, port officer, Okha, confirmed to TOI. Hiravani further added that the two ships will be released after security assessment by the concerned agencies. “Both ships have suffered damages and their assessment is pending. Once the extent of damage is known, it will be repaired and the vessels will be allowed to resume their voyage,” he added. The MV Aviator, sailing under the flag of Marshall Islands, had 22 crew members, all citizens of the Philippines, on board. While all 21 crew members of the MV Atlantic Grace are Indian citizens, sources said. According to ICG, MV Atlantic Grace had come from Kandla port and was going towards Fujairah port, while MV Aviator had left Kandla port and moving towards the anchorage of Tuna Port in Gulf of Kutch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/2-merchant-vessels-collide-off-okha-coast/articleshow/87954061.cms||---

This even as BMC board of administrators’ chairperson Krishna Chakraborty has appealed to residents on Facebook to keep rooftops and other areas of their houses clean to prevent accumulation of stagnant water and breeding of mosquitoes. Notices have already been issued to several such households, asking them to immediately clean up their premises as the civic teams will revisit the houses to check whether the instructions have been complied with or not. “If mosquito larvae are found for the second time in the same houses, notice boards will be put up stating this and appropriate steps will be taken,” said a BMC official. On Friday, Krishna Chakraborty along with a civic team visited several houses in the blocks at her ward. In one such house where there is a dengue patient, mosquito larvae were found inside a bucket on the roof. “Mosquito larvae are being found in many houses inside pots, jars and buckets on roof tops and other places. Our teams are visiting houses across Salt Lake. We are appealing to all residents to cooperate with us and asking them to keep their premises clean so that there is no breeding of mosquito larvae. We will soon hold a citizens’ meeting on this issue,” Chakraborty said. As per last available figures, about 300 persons across BMC area of Salt Lake and Rajarhat have been affected by dengue this year till date and two dengue death have occurred, both in Baguiati. Dengue cases here till early September this year were very low when only 10 cases were reported.

---||Hyderabad||After 1-year gap, Bengali film fest opens to packed halls||HYDERABAD: After a one-year gap owing to the pandemic, the Telangana Bengali Film Festival — Aayna — opened to packed halls over the weekend. On Saturday, film buffs thronged the LV Prasad Digital Film Lab in Banjara Hills that’s playing host to six Bengali and two Telugu films that are on offer, as part of the festival. The rush is likely to continue on Sunday — final day of the event. Apart from trying to bring audiences back to the theatres, the three-day festival being organised by the Hyderabad Bangalee Samity (HBS) in association with the Telangana Department of Language and Culture, also hopes to support technicians through this effort. The proceeds from the festival will be donated for their welfare. “The relationship between Telangana and West Bengal has been great for decades. Under the leadership of K Chandrasekhar Rao, the state developed into a mini-India, a global city,” said V Srinivas Goud, Telangana culture minister, who inaugurated the festival along with renowed actor and former MP, Moon Moon Sen. He congratulated the community in Telangana for successfully organising this festival. The state’s IT secretary, Jayesh Ranjan, who is also part of the jury, said that film festivals like these provide an opportunity to not just watch great movies, but also interact with those involved in making the film. He said that if any other community is willing to curate a similar event in town, the Telangana government will certainly support it. “Last two years have been very different due to the pandemic. Even now some people are scared to step out of their homes. We hope an event like this will have a multiplier effect and people will slowly start coming out for movies and outings,” said Ranjan. Seconding the IT secretary, Sumit Sen, general secretary of HBS, said, “We knew people were staying back even though the pandemic was on the wane. They are going to restaurants, on a holiday but not to the movies. So, as a socio-cultural organisation, we took it upon us to ensure that they come back to the theatres.” The movies listed for Sunday are: Doodh Peether Gaachh, Nirbhaya, Akkash Ongshoto Meghla, Chhobiyal, Magic, Bhubanmoy Bhanu (a documentary), and Telugu movie Love Story.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/after-1-yr-gap-bengali-film-fest-opens-to-packed-halls/articleshow/87954345.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||CM K Chandrasekhar Rao did not seek PM’s appointment, says Bandi Sanjay Kumar||HYDERABAD: Telangana BJP president Bandi Sanjay Kumar on Saturday said that chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao did not seek the appointment of Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his recent visit to Delhi. Stating that the CM had gone to Delhi on a personal work, Sanjay alleged that KCR had tried to give an impression that he was waiting for an audience with the PM. “In the process, he even tried to malign the saffron party in the name of ‘atma gouravam’ (self-respect),” he said. Addressing the state executive meeting here, Sanjay reiterated that the BJP would come to power in Telangana whenever the elections are held either in 2022 or 2023. He said whoever is the party chief minister, he would take the responsibility of getting the first file signed on providing free education and free health to the poor. Claming that his Praja Sangrama Yatra shook the state government, Sanjay said: “The second phase of the yatra will begin between December 17 and 20 to expose the TRS government’s failures and corruption.” He said they will also highlight on the unkept promises of the TRS and also attacks on BJP leaders at the paddy procurement centres. Sanjay said KCR was shunting out leaders like Eatala Rajender who fought for the cause of separate Telangana state. “A power struggle is going on in KCR’s family. That’s the reason why he is continuing in the CM’s chair though he has something in his mind,” he alleged. He said the saffron party was against providing reservations on religious lines and added that he would unite all Hindus. “The AIMIM got 12 seats with just 5% of Muslim votes in Bihar. We should get more seats in Telangana where 80% of Hindu voters are united. The GHMC elections in December 2020 have shown the way forward for the growth of the BJP,” he said. Charging KCR with misleading the people on ST reservations and BC census, Sanjay said: “The TRS president does not talk about BC Bhavans and fee reimbursement for BCs and other castes.” BJP national vice-president DK Aruna, Union tourism minister G Kishan Reddy, BJP national leader Shiva Prakash, OBC Morcha national president K Laxman, senior leaders Eatala, Vijayashanthi, Garikapati Mohan Rao and G Vivek were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-did-not-seek-pms-appointment-says-bandi/articleshow/87954355.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Hyderabad||Health infrastructure boosts organ donation drive in Telangana||HYDERABAD: Rapid upgradation of critical healthcare infrastructure in the state to deal with extra load of Covid patients has resulted in an upswing in organ donations. Organ donations saw a lull during during peak of the first wave, while it picked up afterwards. Over the last six months, the scenario has improved drastically. Jeevandan authorities said that increased efforts were made during the pandemic to tap every possible donor during the period and even during the lowest months, there were 6-7 donations, the numbers started increasing substantially this year. The state has recorded 136 donations so far this year with a total of 508 organs harvested. This compared to 75 donations last year (2020) and 134 during the previous year (2019). Apart from the initial difficulty in convincing family members to donate organs during peak Covid, fact that a Covid positive patient cannot be a donor had limited the donors during the peak pandemic. However, with social activities having opened up, a lot of road accident victims during the recent months turned out to be donors. In a number of cases, where authorities had airlifted organs, arranged for traffic green channels and even utilised the Metro rail for transporting the organs for the first time during this period. Majority of these were airlifted from remote corners. “There has been some improvement in infrastructure in terms of ICU beds, ventilators, ECMO and critical care management, even in remote centres. All this led to an increase in identification and optimisation,” Jeevandan Programme in-charge Dr G Swarnalatha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/health-infrastructure-boosts-organ-donation-drive-in-state/articleshow/87954351.cms||Amrita Didyala

Justice V M Kanade, the Lokayukta, in a November 23 order, directed Medical Council of Maharashtra to remain present before it on February 21, 2022, and submit its report regarding the action taken against quacks. The Maharashtra Council of Homeopathy submitted a list of more than 180 bogus doctors whose names were removed from its registry in January. “Bogus doctors who do not have a valid degree and are not registered with the Medical Council of Maharashtra or Medical Council of Homeopathy, are a menace to society. Most of these doctors set up their practice in slum areas, where people from the lowest rung of society reside,’’ said the Lokayukta. Under the Lokayukta Act, the “Lokayukta or an Upa-Lokayukta may conduct any investigation relating to a matter of definite public importance in public, if he, for reasons to be recorded in writing, thinks fit to do so.” “The possibility of patients dying on account of their negligence cannot be ruled out. I am therefore of the view that this issue needs to be investigated as a public issue since it affects the interests of the general public at large,’’ said the Lokayukta’s order explaining why he is making an open investigation, as it was a public issue. The Commissioner of Police also may depute someone to remain present in February and submit a report regarding the steps taken by the state police. Thereafter, further directions will be given for inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-lokayukta-cracks-down-on-bogus-doctors-in-state/articleshow/87955443.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Delhi||Right-wing NDTF manages to win post of DUTA prez after 2 decades||New Delhi: After more than two decades, a candidate belonging to the right-wing teachers’ group, National Democratic Teachers’ Front (NDTF), has won the post of Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) president. The left-wing outfit, Delhi Teachers’ Front (DTF), lost the post by about 1,300 votes. AK Bhagi, chemistry teacher at Dyal Singh College, is now the president of DUTA. He polled 3,584 votes. DTF’s candidate Abha Dev Habib, physics teacher at Miranda House, received 2,202 votes. On winning the post, Bhagi said, “We are well aware of the huge responsibility this massive victory entails upon NDTF. NDTF expresses its resolve to make DUTA an effective instrument in the resolution of all the long-pending problems faced by the DU system. For this, our approach shall be different from that of the earlier leadership.” He said that DUTA would make efforts to become an organised, well-planned, result-oriented platform to solve issues rationally. “For this, the entire teaching fraternity has to unite under a common DUTA banner. Teachers may subscribe to different political persuasions or ideologies, the dominant majority may be politically non-aligned, but they are all aligned to DUTA. DUTA has to fight for all sections of teachers,” said the new DUTA president. “DUTA has to fight all elements of establishment — Union and Delhi state governments, University Grants Commission, DU and college administrations. But fighting doesn’t imply no interaction with establishment. DUTA shall have to engage different elements of establishment for negotiation and resolutions of issues. At the same time, it has to be prepared to exert pressure on the establishment when required through mass struggles and agitations,” said Bhagi. There were a total of 9,446 voters and 7,194 votes were polled in the election held on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/right-wing-ndtf-manages-to-win-post-of-duta-prez-after-2-decades/articleshow/87954864.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Being a public utility department, it is very important for us to timely and effectively address the complaints generated on social media,” said a DJB official. The agency recently organised its first social media workshop for all its executive engineers and zonal revenue officers wherein ways to build a stronger connection with the public through this mode were discussed. The Delhi government, which has a strong presence on social media, has good examples like the education department’s teachers who are active on different platforms. The water agency plans to invite such in-house social media influencers to suggest ways to officials. “The Twitter handle of DJB addresses many water-related complaints of the consumers, the plan is to increase the mechanism of grievance redressal in a major way,” said the official. Earlier, the agency announced its plan to go faceless with many online services to benefit the customer and promote transparency in the system. Social media grievance redressal system is one major step in that direction. Consumers can generate bills, lodge billing-related grievances, apply for new water and sewer connections, address correction, permission for borewells and raise other requests through its website. Delhi Jal Board on average gets around 1,000 complaints per month on issues related to dirty water, billing and sewer blockage. “At regular intervals, social media interactive sessions will be conducted for all our officers so that they become adept in handling complaints and solving them in time. This will also make the process more transparent, increase customer satisfaction and improve the image of our agency,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/djb-to-train-staff-to-handle-grievances-on-social-media/articleshow/87954866.cms||---

Right from aggressively pursuing and spreading hatred on religious lines, RSS family rule is proving to be detrimental to the growth and progress of the country,” CPI national secretary K Narayana said. Narayana alleged that BJP government, was encouraging privatisation of public sector undertakings. “To save the country from RSS family rule, as many as 19 political parties at national level have come up with slogan of Modi Hatao Desh Bachao,” Narayana said. He said BJP made claims of curbing corruption, but Modi government failed to take any action against 30-plus ministers in Union cabinet who were facing allegations of corruption.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cpi-rss-rule-dangerous-than-dynasty/articleshow/87954352.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In his circular to all police stations, the state police chief said that the case should be investigated with top priority, and a chargesheet should be submitted. He said that the station house officers should rise to the occasion to ensure that the difficulties of complainants are addressed, and ensure that they are not made to pay money without work being done. The state police chief’s circular comes in the wake of a recent high court order that made scathing remarks against the practice of nokkukooli, and instructed the police to treat it as a criminal activity, and charges of extortion and other similar criminal activities should be included while registering the cases in such complaints. The state had declared itself nokkukooli-free from May 1, 2018. The government, in its order, had said that the practice is illegal and it would attract penal provisions of the Kerala Headload Workers’ Act, 1978. The maximum penal provision under the act recommends an imprisonment for six months and fine for various other offences. The order had also said that the labour cards of the workers demanding nokkukooli would be cancelled. Major trade unions, including CITU and INTUC, had welcomed the government’s decision. However, the practice was still being reported from several places, the major recent one being workers blocking a truck belonging to Isro demanding nokkukooli, while it was transporting heavy machinery to VSSC in the capital in September. Labour minister V Sivankutty had convened a meeting last month and had instructed labour department officials to initiate strict action against incidents relating to nokkukooli in the state. It was also decided in the meeting to convene district-level meetings by including labour department officials and trade union leaders and also to convene periodical state-level meetings to be chaired by the minister with the participation of trade union leaders. Amending the headload workers’ act, 1978, is presently under the government’s consideration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/file-cases-act-on-plaints-says-state-police-chief/articleshow/87954865.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Applications for podu land rights swell||HYDERABAD: A large number of people are submitting applications seeking podu (cultivation/ agriculture) rights on forest lands after the state government opened the doors for applicants on November 8. The number of applications submitted so far has exceeded the expectations of the forest and tribal welfare department officials on the extent of land on which podu rights are being sought. For example, over 80,000 applications have been received in Bhadradri-Kothagudem district alone seeking podu rights on nearly three lakh acres of land in the district. As per the preliminary estimates of the officials, the extent of podu land in the district could be about 2.30 lakh acres only. This is not an isolated case as the extent of land seeking podu rights is more than the expected statistics of the government in a majority of the districts. In Mulugu, applicants have sought cultivation rights in more than 77,000 acres, in Adilabad over 60,000 acres and in Jayashankar Bhupalpally nearly 62,000 acres. When a similar exercise was taken up in 2008-09 during YS Rajasekhara Reddy-led Congress government in the undivided state, applications were submitted seeking podu rights on seven lakh acres in Telangana region. Cultivation rights were given for 3.50 lakh acres in the region as more than 50 per cent applications were rejected. Officials said they came across several instances where all the five members of a family had applied for podu rights on the same land. “While photo copies of ration cards and Aadhaar cards along with applications have been collected, we are planning to use the ration cards to eliminate the number of claimants from the same family. The eldest member of the family is likely to be given the podu rights certificate,” said an official. There are two two types of applicants seeking podu rights. The government said it will grant podu rights to people who are STs and doing podu cultivation on forest land prior to December 13, 2005. This is the cut-off date for STs. “These rights are not transferable and it would not be a patta. They would be given only livelihood or subsistence agriculture rights,” said an official. But for non-tribals who have submitted applications, they need to submit proof that their family members or elders have been doing podu cultivation on the land for the last 75 years prior to the cut-off date of December 13, 2005. “The land should be under their possession and cultivation done from last 75 years,” said the official. Telangana Girijana Sangham and Rythu Sangham leader M Shobhan demanded that the government relax the 75-year criteria for non-tribals as not many would have proof of doing podu farming since 1930s.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/applications-for-podu-land-rights-swell/articleshow/87954361.cms||Roushan Ali

---||Delhi||Folk artists bring cultures & traditions unknown to Delhi||NEW DELHI: As the crowd mills around her, oohing and aahing at the art, craft and forest produce on display, Bhavana Rawat holds out a painting of two brides dressed in red saris, urging the viewers to note the intricately designed nose rings traditionally worn in the Kumaon region of Uttarakhand. People take pictures of the fine folk art called Aipan that is passed down from mothers to daughters and is an icon at all festivities in the villages. Not too far from this stall, there are paintings inspired by nature in Gond and Baiga art forms and the famed Pattachitra. Artists are working on them as visitors eye their products. Dilli Haat at INA has been hosting ‘Aadi Mahotsav’, the national tribal festival, since November 16 and introducing to the city folk not just to objects and items, but to little-heard-of traditions and cultures. Yogesh Rawat, 33, has come from Bouna village of Uttarakhand to sell the Munsiyari rajma known for its high nutritional value. While sales have been brisk, Rawat talks about the hardship faced by the growers of this unique variety of lentil, with opportunities still to reach the villagers living in high-altitudes locales. He showed TOI photographs of the upper reaches where the lentil grows and how much it costs to transport it to Munsiyari and then to city markets. “There are at least 130 families involved in growing rajma. I hope more opportunities will reach our villages so that the intermediaries can be weeded out,” Rawat said. The crowds that the tribal fair has been attracting only reaffirm the growing interest of the city in a life that is so alien to it. According to Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India (TRIFED), a body under the Union tribal affairs ministry of tribal affairs, the daily footfall has been over 10,000 on weekdays and up to 20,000 on weekends. With around 200 stalls from across the country and around 1,000 rural producers participating, Aadi Mahotsav, said TRIFED managing director Pravir Krishna, is a great way to draw the indigenous tribes into the mainstream. TRIFED first organised the festival in 2017. This year, the event, which ends on November 30, has already garnered sales of over Rs 4 crore. An example of mainstreaming is evident at the stall where the Nicobari tribals are showing their therapeutic coconut oil. “I saw the metro train for the first time in my life,” smiled Lenglie, a shy man who has come to Delhi for the first time from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Surrounded by the crowds, Lenglie and Hilda narrate how coconut is a lifeline for their people and how their lives depend on earnings from coconut. There are stalls offering tribal cuisine too. There is an impression menu card strung at the food stall from Nagaland. Among other things, it offers, “Local vodka made by tribal Naga women at home.” Seibem Khongsai, the chef at the counter, brightly tells you that the Naga brew is a traditionally made from fermented rice. “The process requires a lot of patience and precision. Since the grandmothers are at home at all times, they watch over the whole process. But they also teach the young people about the tradition of making the alcoholic drink,” said Khongsai as he poured shots for people who wanted to share his tradition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/folk-artists-bring-cultures-traditions-unknown-to-city/articleshow/87955458.cms||Ambika Pandit

The junior doctors maintain that due to lack of counselling for one year, the load of first year students is falling on second and third year students. Due to this the workload is increasing and although the association had raised the concern, but the government is not listening. Agitated junior doctors did not allow OPD to run on Saturday. When the senior doctor sat in the OPD, they could manage to attend only a few patients who came with old prescriptions. While there was a huge crowd of patients at the prescription counter. “I have come for treatment from Rewa because of heart problem. My local doctor had referred me to SRN but because of the strike, I am helpless”, said Ram Charit Mishra. Likewise, Vindeshwari Prasad had come from Jaunpur was troubled by stomach ailment. After standing in the queue since morning, they were not able to get the OPD slip due to strike. The protesting residents also took out a candle procession in the evening. The junior doctors gathered at SRN and raised their demand vigorously. The doctors said that this is a symbolic demonstration and if the demands are not accepted, the agitation will be further intensified and even emergency services would be stopped at SRN. “Our demands are justified as we are here to serve the patients and for this we constantly work peacefully under pressure of work and when there was a nationwide strike today, we joined our association. If the demand is not accepted, then the scope of the movement will be increased”, said Dr Servesh Pathak, office bearer of the Prayagraj Unit of the association. Principal, MLN Medical College, Dr SP Singh, said, “It is true that the services were affected for some time, but later senior doctors attended the OPD and all were treated. OT also functioned normally”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/junior-doctors-observe-strike-at-srn-hospital/articleshow/87954867.cms||---

Police sources said that the investigation team will also probe the alleged links of the accused with people involved in drug cases. Thankachan was produced before a magistrate on Saturday evening, and he was sent in three days’ police custody. Miss South India Ansi Kabeer, Miss Kerala first runner-up (2019) Anjana Shajan and their friend Mohammad Ashiq were killed in the accident which took place when they were returning from a party at a hotel in Fort Kochi on November 1. The investigators later found CCTV footage showing the car of Thankachan following the car that met with accident. The police team is learnt to have seized Thankachan’s mobile phone as part of the investigation. Police submitted before the court that Thankachan knew that Abdul Rahman, who was driving the ill-fated car, was drunk. Thankachan was stalking the models by following their car from Hotel No 18 after the night party in the early hours of November 1. Police submitted that his actions made those in the car panic, and it eventually led to speeding and the accident. Thankachan has filed a bail petition on the other hand, claiming that he was not involved in the case. His petition will be considered for hearing on Monday. Earlier in the day, the accused was taken to Hotel No 18 at Fort Kochi. Police said that they expect to get better clarity by questioning Thankachan in custody. Rahman is also likely to be questioned along with Thankachan. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/vyttila-accident-syju-in-3-day-police-custody/articleshow/87954876.cms||---

This followed a Pocso court in Bihar’s Araria district completing its hearing and sentencing of a rape suspect in a single day on October 4, beating the previous record of a Datia district court in Madhya Pradesh that concluded in August 2018 a rape trial in three days. Manvendra Mishra, principal judge at Nalanda’s juvenile justice board, completed the trial after examining five witnesses, including the doctor who conducted the rape survivor’s physical examination and the investigating officer. The girl’s statement was recorded. The judge took circumstantial evidence such as bloodstained clothes, FIR copy, and forensic report of the bloodstains into account while pronouncing the judgment. Though this was his only offence, he has showed an “ability to commit crime and he cannot be released in the best interest of society”, said judge Mishra as he sentenced the teenager to two three-year terms, both running concurrently. He asked authorities of the remand home to ensure periodical psychological counselling for the juvenile and deduction of time spent in custody from the quantum of punishment. The teenager was accused of rape and taken into custody following a complaint from the girl’s mother. Additional public prosecutor Rajesh Pathak said the boy was arrested the day the crime was committed and charges under IPC and the Pocso law were framed against him on November 25.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nalanda-court-convicts-teen-in-1-day-rape-trial/articleshow/87956100.cms||Farrukh Nadim
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Tomato prices profit some farmers but others lose out||HYDERABAD: In a first, farmers recently got the highest payment of Rs 100 for a kg of tomato as opposed to dealers who usually reap the benefits at the expense of farmers whenever the crop suffers a damage. But, only a few farmers who had the harvest and stocks commanded the price, while the rest have not only lost the crop in the rains but also their investments in raising the crop. Even the consumers are hit hard as tomato prices are set to remain high for some more days unlike in previous instances when price correction used to take place within a week or so.  Some days ago, tomato price was Rs 3,100 a crate which translates to about Rs 100 per kg. “In my village, those who had the crop on the field lost the entire harvest,” S Chandrasekhar Reddy, a farmer from Yerpedu in Chittoor district, said. Because of Telangana and Hyderabad’s reliance on tomato imports from AP, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Karnataka, consumers had to bear the brunt of price hike. Horticulture director L Venkatram Reddy said tomato grown on the outskirts of Hyderabad, Rangareddy and Vikarabad districts is declining. “Nearly 30,000 acres of cultivable land had been converted to other crops. This is owing to continuous losses and a large portion of crops shifting to paddy and cotton,” he said. Agriculture experts said there was need to replicate the crop insurance plan. “Telangana has done away with crop insurance, but having it will help farmers retain their pricing while consumers will get their money’s worth,” GV Ramanajaneyulu, agriculture scientist, observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tomato-prices-profit-some-farmers-but-others-lose-out/articleshow/87954377.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

And not just a roar, you may be even luckier to be privy to a pride of Asiatic lions crossing your path at the entrance of Port Pipavav. Awed? Read on. Welcome to Port Pipavav in Gujarat’s Amreli district, managed by the world’s biggest container terminal operator - Denmark-headquartered AP Moller Maersk, possibly the only such maritime facility in the world where lions tread free without fear or human interference. Sometimes these felines even come close to the jetty area and saunter between the huge containers that are offloaded from the ships. Port workers, however, have learned the art of cohabiting unperturbed in the presence of royalty! Believe it or not, this peaceful co-existence here is so fascinating, that a lioness has found the port’s main gate a peaceful zone to give birth to her cubs despite the constant flow of vehicles and port employees. In fact, wildlife experts say Port Pipavav is the only such port in the world which is a home to an endangered wild animal. "Your peaceful post-dinner stroll may be interjected by a lion or a cub — but it’s nothing uncommon. For us, it’s as simple as seeing a stray dog or cattle," a port executive, not wanting to be named, living in the colony for many years now, told TOI. The port colony houses 240 families. In zest, a senior forest officer said, "Port employees’ mobile phones have more photos and videos of lions in their colony and at the port than their own selfies!" Amreli district adjoins the famous Gir sanctuary, the natural and only abode of Asiatic lions. But over the years, a burgeoning lion population has spilled out of the protected areas and into the district; frequently seen making a kill right inside villages, sauntering on the roads or calmly parking themselves right outside the villages. Sources said there are at least 40 lions residing within a 3-4 km stretch between Pipavav and Kovaya village, home to the massive plant of Ultratech Cement. The lions usually reside in the thick bushes adjoining the seashore, but often wander into the port area via the railway tracks. Badal Saiyed, who regularly drives trucks to the port, said, "We often have to slow down our vehicles to let the lions stroll across the road." On the 500m road leading to the port, truck drivers often stop their vehicles to shoot videos of lions crossing the road or just sitting in the bushes, a few metres off the actual facility. Many of them, however, have also been booked for ‘harassing’ this endangered species by chasing them with their vehicles. Notwithstanding the fact that many a time lions have killed their costly and sole source of income — the milch cattle — ṯthe people of Amreli love the lions. And Pipavav too is no exception. It doesn’t matter for these royal animals if hundreds of ships berth at the port. Their schedule remains unchanged! Amreli district, an abode of 100 lions: Though fascinating, experts say, lions in a port is not sustainable for the wild cats in the long term. "Landscape and habitat management for the growing population is a subject of paramount importance going forward. I believe initiatives such as Project Lion are being designed keeping in mind such long term-management goals," said Priyvrat Gadhvi, member, state wildlife board. How Pipavav got its nameLegend has it that the king of Pipa in Rajasthan and his queen were touring Saurashtra around 1,500AD following spiritual guidance by their guru. Noticing acute famine here, they wanted to help out people but as per the conditions laid down by their guru, they couldn’t use their royal wealth. The king was a great singer while his wife a danseuse. Using their art, they collected funds for charity and got a stepwell (vav) made to address water scarcity. One day, in his dream, the king saw Lord Krishna telling him about a neem tree which had a sole sweet branch. Next day, he and villagers found it to be true and named the place as Pipavav Dham. "Interestingly, Bherai village where the present port stands had a jetty with regular trade to Mumbai and south India with Rajula town being the nearest hub. Following disputes among claimants, Padma Shri poet and saint Dula Bhaya Kag suggested that the port be named after Pipavav Dham," said Prakash Thaker, former advisor, external affairs and PR, Port Pipavav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarats-pride-roars-at-port/articleshow/87954890.cms||---

Asking the party cadres to win booths if they to see bulldozers crushing mafia empire in the state, Yogi also asked the party’s grassroots workers to “send the opposition, which avoided coming among people during the hour of need in Covid-19 first and second waves, in home isolation forever”. While mobilising the booth in-charges of Kashi region unit of BJP at TD College ground, Yogi said, “The coming 2022 polls in UP have become an attraction for the entire world. People are seeing how low the anti-BJP forces can go and also the polarisation of anti-India forces. The contest is going to take place between pro- and anti-nationalists. It had also become clear when some people started comparing Sardar Patel, who united India, with a divisive Jinnah, who tried to insult India.” “Before 2017 it was a fashion for the opposition to hit the faith and sentiment of people, fanning riots and implicate people associated with Hindu organisations and BJP in false cases,” Yogi said, adding, “However, cases lodged against terrorists were withdrawn.” The CM further said, “By allowing corruption to flourish, the development of state was hampered and job opportunities for youths were robbed. In five years, the people who indulged in rioting, criminal activities, spreading anarchy and corruption are on the backfoot. The interests of farmer, youth, women and poor were protected in this period, which upset the opposition and compelled them to recall Jinnah.” Highlighting the achievements of his government, Yogi said, “In past the mafia and criminals ran abduction industry, committed crimes like loot, robbery, extortion and grabbed land fearlessly. But, today the bulldozers are rolling on their empires.” He highlighted how the vision and decision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not allow people to die of hunger during the pandemic, he said that the provision of free ration for people has been extended till the festival of Holi. Giving all credit to party workers for the victory in 2014 and 2019 parliamentary and 2017 assembly polls in UP, he asked them to get prepared for strengthening the party at each booth for 2022 assembly election.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/up-polls-will-be-fought-between-pro-anti-national-forces-yogi/articleshow/87954885.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Police sought the accused in custody instead and the counsel for the investigation team submitted before the court that it was highly important that the house and surrounding of the accused is inspected in their presence. Police also submitted that the mobile phones, and documents regarding the marriage between the first accused and the victim also need to be recovered. Mofiya’s husband Mohammed Suhail, 27, his mother Rukhiya, 55, and father Yousuf, 63, were remanded in judicial custody on Thursday. Police had invoked sections 304B (dowry death), 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), 306 (abetment to suicide) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) against the accused. According to sources, the report submitted by the investigation officer in the court make severe allegations against the accused, including grievous physical and mental torture of the victim. The police have also found in the initial investigation that the accused harassed the victim demanding more dowry. A petition was filed at the Aluva East police station subsequently and in a reconciliation meeting, the husband provoked the victim and she slapped him on his face. The couple got married in April and lived together for four months. The victim was harassed over this period so as to get her parents to deliver more gold ornaments and other valuables. The accused also mentally harassed the victim by pronouncing the first talaq on October 28 via registered notice. He had also demanded Rs 40 lakh for business purposes, police said. According to police, Mofiya’s mother-in-law allegedly treated her like a maid. The father accused her of being mentally unstable and filed a letter for divorce in the mosque, police said. Mofiya committed suicide at her house at Edayapuram on November 22. Meanwhile, opposition leader V D Satheesan visited the victim’s family on Saturday. He alleged that the CI, C L Sudheer, who was named in the suicide note of Mofiya, was under the protection of CPM. He urged the chief minister to not let such incidents repeat. Sudheer was suspended on Friday after strong protests from the opposition parties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/mofiya-death-crime-branch-opposes-bail-plea-of-accused/articleshow/87954894.cms||---

The capital has around 7 lakh registered construction workers. The government assistance will be transferred into the bank accounts of the remaining construction workers in a couple of days. “The Kejriwal government is standing with the construction workers of Delhi. Due to air pollution, the livelihood of construction workers has ceased because of the closure of construction activities in Delhi. With this in view, the Delhi government announced assistance to all 7 lakh registered construction workers of Rs 5,000 each and for this Rs 350 crore was issued,” the government said in a statement. “Even during the corona crisis, the Delhi government had sent a total amount of Rs 5,000 in the accounts of all the construction workers,” it stated further. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia said the Delhi government has been standing with construction workers at every step. “Workers are the spinal cord of the country, which strengthens the country. If the worker is standing then our buildings are standing, the city is standing. Therefore, the honour and interests of the workers are the main priority of our government. In Delhi, construction activities have been stopped, but the Delhi government will assist its labour brothers and sisters in every possible way,” Sisodia stated. The deputy CM said that as long as the construction activities are closed in Delhi, the government would hold large registration camps in Delhi to register the construction workers not already registered with the construction board. “This way, all the workers can benefit from the schemes introduced for the welfare of the workers,” Sisodia stated. The government has estimated that the capital has around 10 lakh construction workers, out of which 7 lakh are now registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rs-5k-given-to-3-lakh-construction-workers/articleshow/87954879.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Not allies, but MNS-BJP may have ‘understanding’||MUMBAI: While a formal alliance between the two is unlikely for the BMC polls, MNS strategists have said the party may have an ‘understanding’ with the BJP in key areas to defeat Shiv Sena. Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis had on Wednesday visited MNS chief Raj Thackeray’s new home ‘Shivtirth’ in Dadar, fuelling speculation of a BJP-MNS alliance for the polls. However, a senior MNS functionary said that the BJP wasn’t keen on a formal alliance. “We can have an understanding on certain seats and have friendly fights. This formula can be implemented in areas like Dadar, Mahim, Worli, Sewree, Wadala, Bhandup, Vikhroli, Magathane and Chandivali. However, this is going to be a difficult task since friendly fights don’t always turn out to be friendly.” The functionary said that the MNS could do well in around 30 seats if the BJP gives it tacit support. “These are the seats where the BJP has no presence and there is no chance they can defeat Sena. So with the MNS as the lead player, if the BJP supports us, we can defeat Sena here and dent them in many other seats,” the source added. Six out of seven MNS corporators had joined rival Sena in 2017. The MNS is now left with only one corporator, Sanjay Turde, in the BMC. While Fadnavis’s visit to Raj’s home was described by both the BJP and MNS as a courtesy visit and apolitical, political analyst Birju Mundra said, “At this stage, a formal alliance can’t be ruled out either. Both parties will have to tie up to take on Sena, but it seems unlikely that this will dent Sena in a big way. More than an alliance with the MNS, the BJP will have to tackle infighting within the party.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-not-allies-but-mns-bjp-may-have-understanding/articleshow/87955469.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Apart from the woman, the sordid tale of love, sex and treachery had led to the murder of her nine-year-old daughter in September. Rampyari Sahu and her daughter Rani were assaulted with concrete before the latter was strangulated by Rajesh Sahu. The accused was arrested after a prolonged chase across India which ended at Besa on the outskirts of the city on November 19. Rajesh, married to Rampyari’s daughter with two children, had managed to keep cops at bay for around two months with the help of the skills he confessed to have imbibed watching crime serials. The Kalmeshwar police team comprising senior PI Asifraja Shaikh and Asst PI Pravin Munde under the supervision of SP Rural Vijay Kumar Magar with the help of some citizens and Beltarodi police managed to zero in on Rajesh as he was heading to a cyber cafe to revive his email ID. The cops were helped by bank officials to trace the location of Rajesh who was not using a mobile phone. Rajesh used his Aadhaar card and Paytm to operate his bank account which helped the bank officials to understand his location. Rajesh always used mobile phones of passers-by to make calls and would sneak away from the place. Police said Rajesh and Rampyari were staying at a construction site at Besa as ‘husband-wife’ projecting Rani as their ‘daughter’. He had planned to seek a job as a farm labourer at a desolate place so that the identification of the bodies would not be done easily. It’s learnt that Rajesh went to Sitabuldi after committing the murder and took a bus to reach Chandrapur after changing into new clothes. He later took a train to reach Howrah in Kolkata but his belongings and phone got stolen. He had lodged a complaint and travelled in the train showing the FIR as proof of his condition. Rajesh had revealed his name and that of his village to the farm owner who had employed him. The owner had also casually clicked his photograph which later helped the police to track him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/son-in-law-kills-woman-nabbed-after-prolonged-chase-across-india/articleshow/87953242.cms||Soumitra Bose

He gave this direction in connection with a petition filed by Madi Saibabu and a few others from Pasra Nagaram village in Govindaraopet mandal in Mulugu district. The petitioners said the process pertaining to granting forest dwelling rights was being done by the authorities in a faulty manner. “The procedure envisaged under the Act speaks about gram sabhas, forest rights committees, etc., but the authorities are unilaterally branding us as encroachers and disallowing us even from filing an application seeking rights,” the forest dwellers said. The methods adopted by the officials were contrary to the central Forest Dwelling Rights Act, they said. “The district authorities have wrongly declared us as encroachers to deny us the benefits under the Act,” they said.

Around 80 of them have got jobs. Deputy commissioner of police Usha Rangnani said the objective was to wean these youths away from criminal activities or drug abuse and help them join the mainstream. “A special drug deaddiction campaign was also launched in the northwest district under ‘nasha mukt bharat abhiyan’. This month-long campaign comprised drug awareness seminars, nukkad-nataks and sensitisation programmes with the help of which at least three out of 20 youths who were registered in various deaddiction centers, have recovered fully from drug addiction,” Rangnani said. The special drives were held in areas of Sangam Park, Jahangirpuri, Wazirpur and Maurya Enclave, in association with various NGOs and volunteers, police said. “Efforts of the district team bore fruitful results and three youths—Imran, Sahil and Azharuddin of Jahangirpuri area—recovered completely,” the officer added. The police have also taken action against drug peddlers. “In the last one month, 12 people were arrested in the district under NDPS Act and 18 people were booked under COTPA Act.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/500-vulnerable-youths-get-skill-training-in-a-yr/articleshow/87955470.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

She also appealed to the people to ensure the victory of AD(S). Anupriya said that the elections will be contested on the issue of development. “We need to think about what previous governments gave you and what the NDA government at the Centre and Yogi government in the state have given you. Development is everywhere in the state, a network of airports is getting ready, medical colleges are being made. The PM has started a Rs 64,000-crore mega project for an independent and healthy India. All the public labs will be connected in the country. Wellness centres in rural and urban areas will be developed and critical care hospitals will be made in the districts.” She claimed that the key to forming a government is with the backwards. “Former PM VP Singh was a real messiah of backwards and deprived people. It is time to think about why reservation was given to the backwards after 40 years of independence.” Anupriya said that her party follows the path shown by Dr Sonelal Patel. “With the the struggle of AD(S), the backwards were able to get 27% reservation in admission at Sainik and Central schools. I hope PM Modi will fulfil the demand of the OBC ministry on the lines of the minority ministry.” “We should have the goal to accomplish the ideas and thoughts of Doctor Saheb (BR Ambedkar). In the elections, booth management is most important. So, go to each village and chaupal and take the party’s ideology and agenda to all,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/backwards-deprived-will-playkey-role-in-up-polls-anupriya/articleshow/87954896.cms||---

Addressing the two-day ‘vari (paddy) deeksha’ here on Saturday, Revanth said: “If the KCR government is unable to procure paddy, let it give Rs 10,000 crore to the Congress. We will not only procure the entire paddy at Rs 1,960 MSP per quintal, but also offer a bonus of Rs 500 per quintal.” Revanth asked KCR to accept his challenge. Nalgonda MP N Uttam Kumar Reddy said the Congress would seek justice for the farmers in the state assembly and Parliament. “The government should purchase discoloured and soaked paddy and should not impose restrictions on cultivating paddy during Yasangi season,” he said.

Paddy production has fallen by 30-40% in the district in the current first-crop season in comparison to the corresponding period last year, said the farmers. The price of paddy Jyothy matta has gone up from Rs 18 per kg in October to Rs 22 per kg in November. The price of Uma matta has gone up from Rs 18/kg in October to Rs 19/kg in November. The price of Jaya variety paddy has also gone up from Rs 17 to Rs 18 per kg in the last one month. Paddy procurement by Kerala state civil supplies corporation (SupplyCo), the state government’s nodal agency for paddy procurement, at the support price of Rs 28 per kg has also helped in paddy price rise. Meanwhile, SupplyCo procured 60,000 metric tonne paddy from farmers so far, 60% more than the expected procurement of the first-crop season. During the first crop last year 1,31,000 metric tonne was procured. But this time the maximum expected procurement will be less than 1.10 lakh metric tonne, said Mukundan Unni, district paddy marketing officer. He said that 12,721 farmers who sold the paddy to SupplyCo were paid Rs 115.29 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/prices-of-paddy-go-up-in-open-market-in-palakkad-due-to-rains/articleshow/87954899.cms||---

He is among 600 people, all relatives of patients, who benefit from the scheme of Fazlani Aishabai and Haji Abdul Latif Charitable Trust. Launched in February 2021, the initiative is a boon for impoverished kin of patients at the government-run hospital. “Relatives of many patients eat a vada pav for lunch or dinner. Two square meals a day in Mumbai costs Rs150-200 and the poor cannot afford it,” trust chairman Abdul Kader Fazlani had said earlier. Fazlani, along with Congress MLA Amin Patel, met medical education minister Amit Deshmukh before permission was granted to start this scheme. “This was a dire need as patients’ relatives did not have resources to eat hygienically-prepared, nutritious food. More NGOs should come forward to start such initiatives in other government hospitals,” said Patel. Procured from an ISO-certified caterer, the free meals are given twice a day. “As per our chairman’s instructions, the food should be nutritious and there should be no compromise on quality. We have kept it vegetarian so that nobody has any hesitation in accepting it,” said trust CEO Shabir Mushtaq Mir, adding that they often make “surprise visits” to the caterer’s kitchen to ensure quality and hygiene. “Beneficiaries get food coupons a day ahead so that the trust’s volunteers know the number of food packets they need to arrange for that day. We ensure zero wastage of food,” said Mir. Hospitals have to provide food to patients and relatives have to fend for themselves. “This initiative should be replicated at other hospitals,” said JJ hospital dean Dr Ranjit Mankeshwar. Mangesh Rathod from Nanded is with his mother who is battling liver cancer. He lost his father to Covid in April. “We are financially exhausted and cannot afford good food from outside. The scheme is a boon for people like us,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ngo-serves-up-free-meals-for-kin-of-poor-patients-at-jj-hospital/articleshow/87955474.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

Association president Bhanudas Sonnaik, secretary Babal Satodkar and other members told TOI that after mining operations were suspended in 2012, the families of about 55 truck owners in Tarmatha were rendered jobless. The members complained that when mining operations were restarted in 2019 in the form of transportation of e-auction ore, the company authorities instead of engaging their trucks brought new Volvo trucks that can transport about 45 tonnes of ore. They said that since then, the company authorities have not invited any local truck owners to operate their trucks. The members said they have met chief minister Pramod Sawant several times in this connection, but to no avail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/surla-locals-want-their-trucks-to-be-used-for-ore-transport/articleshow/87954943.cms||---

The film traces the undocumented history of ‘first heroes’ of the LGBTQIA community and their fight against an unknown virus back in the 1980s. “If we ourselves do not document the history of our suffering, no one else will,” Oliveira said while speaking at the festival. ‘The First Fallen’ is a tribute to my ancestors who belonged to the LGBTQIA community and were the victims of the first wave of the AIDS epidemic in Brazil in 1983, said the director of the film. “The film is an attempt to tell the world the untold stories of the suffering and discrimination of the sexual minorities of the 1980s in Brazil. This is a portrait of the past that is long gone, but it is very current as well,” he said. Oliveira spoke of the apathy of the system in recognising the LGBTQIA community who perished due to the infections in the early 1980s. “People were dying since 1983 because of a virus which had no name, but they started counting the deaths only from 1985. I remember vividly, when I went to the club in my young age, there weren’t any people above 30 years as they all had died,” Oliveira said. He said that a conscious effort was made to cast people who belong to his community. “We were conscious on our part to not only make a film about LGBTQIA, but with people from our community who are living with AIDS. There were a lot of gay actors and trans-actresses interested in portraying the characters.” The film was screened at a theatre packed with audience at Iffi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/brazilian-film-traces-suffering-of-lgbtqia-community-in-1980s/articleshow/87954898.cms||---
---||Delhi||Muffin to paintings, Tihar earns lakhs at trade fair in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Among the tempting items on array at the India International Trade Fair at Pragati Maidan, one unique stall is drawing a lot of attention. The products on sale there aren’t made in factories or at artisanal bakeries or by rural craftsmen. They have all been kneaded, sculpted or painted by prisoners of Tihar Jail. In the past 13 days, the jail stall has already toted up over Rs 8 lakh in sales. On Wednesday afternoon, the prison staff busily tended to customers who were buying food products, wooden items and other offerings. Purchasing muffins for his two children from the stall at Hall No 5, Ranjan said, “The jail inmates have put a lot of effort into these items. We should encourage them. Their bakery products are very tasty.” Between November 14 and November 26, Tihar products worth Rs 8.3 lakh were grabbed by the fair visitors. Last Sunday, products worth Rs 93,000 were purchased from the stall, while on Wednesday and Friday, the cash register rang up over Rs 1 lakh each in business for the day. All the products — ranging from Rs 10-per-piece pastries to a wooden elephant costing Rs 50,000 — have been made by the incarcerated convicts. Apart from the baked goods, there are other food items, wooden products and paintings created by the prisoners. Tihar Jail assistant superintendent Kapil Kumar, who was present at Pragati Maidan, revealed that people were mostly purchasing bakery products and wooden items. “We have been selling out our bakery items every day. Each day, we bring in fresh products from the jail,” he said. Even the Delhi state pavilion has showcased Tihar-made objects such as wood wall clocks, a wooden temple and a replica of the Taj Mahal. In fact, a wooden horse and an elephant there fascinated children, a lot of whom were taking selfies with the sculpted jumbo. Krishna Nagar resident Surender Singh is always drawn to the Tihar products when he comes to the fair. “The bakery products are fresh and tasty. In earlier years too, I bought food items from the jail stall,” he claimed. Sandeep Goel, DG (prisons), disclosed how much prisoners are paid for their work. “For skilled work, we pay prisoners Rs 308 per day, for semi-skilled work Rs 248 and for unskilled work, Rs 194,” he said. According to Goel, the involvement of inmates in such vocational activities helps them pick up skills they can use when rebuilding their lives once they are released. “In many cases, the inmates also send the money they earn from their work in jail to their families and relatives,” Goel said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/muffin-to-paintings-tihar-earns-lakhs-at-trade-fair/articleshow/87955482.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Delhi||Ensuring proper flow key to revive Yamuna: Experts||NEW DELHI: Despite the first phase of Yamuna Action Plan being started in 1993 and more than Rs 1,500 crore being spent on various projects to rejuvenate the river, no significant change in water quality has been seen in the last two decades. Experts say while the focus of the government has been on construction of sewage treatment plants (STP), other issues like proper flow, discharge of industrial effluents and rejuvenation of the floodplain have failed to get the required attention. In Delhi, the 22km urban stretch of the Yamuna from Wazirabad to Okhla is the most polluted. The National Green Tribunal-appointed Yamuna Monitoring Committee, which has now been dissolved, in its report last year had stated, “The analysis on water quality (between 2015 and 2020) both by CPCB and Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) clearly doesn’t point to a trend towards improvement in water quality.” A report prepared by DPCC in October this year stated that all eight monitoring stations didn’t meet the parameters related to dissolved oxygen and biochemical oxygen demand, which revealed the poor quality of water. Manoj Mishra of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan said, “There was no improvement in the Yamuna over the years as the priorities of the government were wrong. The primary focus was on STPs. Linking sewage management with river rejuvenation will not give the desired results.” “The Yamuna has lost a majority of its flow, but ensuring it is still not the priority. Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh have to come together to ensure the environmental flow. Anything less will only result in shifting of the goal posts, as has been the practice till date,” added Mishra. Vimlendu Jha, founder of Swechha NGO, said, “The six-point plan announced by the chief minister to clean the Yamuna will not be sustainable till environmental flow is ensured. We need interstate cooperation for it. An NGT order says industries should ensure zero liquid discharge. However, treated waste released from industries goes into the Yamuna. Neither treated nor untreated industrial effluents should be allowed to be discharged in the river.” “The government should give attention to rejuvenation of the floodplain, which helps in recharging surface and groundwater. No encroachment and no redevelopment should be allowed on the Yamuna floodplain,” added Jha. Sushmita Sengupta, senior programme manager, water and sanitation programme, Centre for Science and Environment, said efforts were taken earlier to construct new STPs, but attention was not given to run existing plants at their full capacity. “In an urbanised set-up, constructing sewer lines and connecting them with new STPs is a challenge,” she added. Ravi Agarwal, director, Toxics Link, said waste released from industries also goes to STPs, which have not been designed to deal with such effluents. “Many reports state that common effluent treatment plants do not meet the required standards. Though a ban on sale, storage, transportation and marketing of soaps and detergent that do not meet Bureau of Indian Standards norms was imposed this year, implementation has been a big issue. More accountability and public awareness are required,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ensuring-proper-flow-key-to-revive-yamuna-experts/articleshow/87955472.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

TOI had recently reported about the abysmal condition in which Tomar was living - in a tin shed house at a slum locality of Dehradun. The 30-year-old cricketer will be the vice-captain of the India ‘B’ team. The top 60 cricketers across the country are selected for the Challenger Trophy. Besides Tomar, spinner Pooja Raj is the only other player from Uttarakhand to have been selected. Raj, who is part of India ‘D’ squad, was the captain of the U-19 side which won the Women’s U-19 BCCI One Day Trophy last month which incidentally was state’s maiden domestic cricket trophy since the state association, Cricket Association of Uttarakhand (CAU), was granted affiliation by the BCCI in 2019. Tomar has been rewarded with a spot in the team because of her consistent performance in the recent domestic one day trophy where she even scored a brilliant century against Chandigarh. "I would like to thank TOI for reporting on Anju's talent and her financial situation,” said Rohit Chauhan, Tomar’s coach. “I am looking forward to the Challenger Trophy as a good performance in this tournament increases the probability of making into the Indian team,” said Tomar. The Challenger Trophy will kick-off on December 4 while India ‘B’ will play their first game on December 5. All matches will be held in Vijayawada including the final scheduled on December 9.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-womens-team-captain-anju-tomar-gets-selected-for-challenger-trophy/articleshow/87953793.cms||Mohammad Anab

He added that this edition was different because it was held within a short span of time as the last festival was delayed and held just 10 months ago in January 2021. “Despite the short time available to make the arrangements, we have received a positive response from both national and international guests so far. We have shown that hosting an international festival is possible during a pandemic,” said Faldesai.

Briefing reporters here on Saturday, he said agricultural crops on over 50 hectares has been damaged in the district in the rains. About 7,000 cusecs to 8,000 cusecs of water is flowing on the Vaigair river bed as of now after the dam filled up and shutters were opened. People had been warned against venturing into the river or bathing their cattle in it. However, simulation studies had been conducted for releasing 20,000 cusecs, 40,000 cusecs and 60,000 cusecs and all preventive measures had been taken.Notwithstanding the heavy rain that lashed Madurai in the past few weeks, the district has received slightly lesser rainfall than what it should have received in the normal course till date. Aneesh Sekhar said the northeast monsoon has brought only 350 mm rainfall till now, a little short of the 400 mm it normally receives. He said almost all water bodies in the district had been filled between 75% and 90% of their total capacity. Some rural areas near Melur had been inundated due to the recent rainfall forcing about 450 people into relief camps. These people had been provided with basic requirements.In all, 33 interdepartmental teams comprising personnel from PWD, revenue, DRDA and Madurai corporation had been constituted to continuously monitor the rain situation. He said that out of the 1,012 tanks fed by the Periyar main channel in the district, 502 were full, 342 had 76% to 99% water in them and 140 tanks had 51% to 75% while only 28 tanks held lesser water — between 26% and 60%.In the Periyar Vaigai basin, 98 of the 210 tanks had reached maximum capacity.

While this innovative move is aimed at offering an option to the affected parties to get easy access to the details of lands, experts have raised concerns whether such a step would serve the purpose considering that most of the land acquisitions are made in rural areas. However, an official related to the orbital rail project said Thursday’s notification is a “successive one” after detailed notifications were published in local newspapers when the railways first expressed its intent to acquire the land for the project and also invited objections. “The earlier notifications published in newspapers had all the specific details. This notification was issued after the process of hearing objections had been completed. The first notification specifying the intent of acquiring any land will be published in newspapers with all details of the land parcels and their owners,” the official said. Sources said other government agencies including the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the road transport ministry may also go for using QR code for notifications to acquire land. They said this will help people to get the full notification on their phone and there would be no requirement to look for the notification here and there. “The practical issue is whether it works in rural India. As of now it may not be appropriate. How many people in villages will download the mobile app and read the QR codes,” said a former NHAI official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/railways-issues-land-acquisition-details-in-qr-code-for-the-first-time/articleshow/87955487.cms||Dipak K Dash

Railway officials said the forest officials entered the Palakkad divisional office functioning in Olavakkode railway station to retrieve the memory card containing the data on the speed of the train when it hit the elephants. The officials entered the memu shed in the afternoon and managed to collect the memory card. However, hundreds of loco pilots detained them in protest against the delay on the part of TN forest officials in releasing the two loco pilots, including one assistant loco pilot of the train which hit the elephants. The loco pilots had appeared before the TN forest officials on Friday night itself following the direction of the forest officials in Coimbatore after the accident. The TN officials were detained at the railway station till evening until the loco pilots were released, said a railway official in Palakkad. “The union of loco pilots were already indignant at the delay in the release of their two colleagues by the TN. This prompted them to detain the five TN officials at the station. The situation was brought under control by the intervention of top officials. The forest officials were released after RPF took their statement by the RPF,” said a railway official. Railway officials said the speed limit on Kanjikode-Madukkarai stretch is 45kmph. The speed of the train when it was passing the stretch was 42kmph. A Kerala forest official said the speed on the particular stretch should be reduced further to bring down accidents on the stretch. Walayar forest officials have submitted a report to the Palakkad divisional forest officer on the steps being implemented in Kerala to reduce trains hitting elephants. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/five-tn-forest-dept-officials-detained-in-palakkad/articleshow/87954916.cms||---

Small portions of money spent on diesel and petrol were used in anti-India activities and our money was being used against us. When farmers will be happy, prosperity will come. With ethanol plants, more job opportunities will be created for youth,” said the CM. He further said that better connectivity is required for the plant and the investment in the area will open the gate to employment opportunities and business. Speaking on the occasion, CM Yogi again raised the Jinnah issue while criticizing opposition and said that before 2017, the governments used to take back cases against the terrorists attacking the Ramjanmanhoomi in Ayodhaya. These people are rioters and followers of Jinnah and they won’t be able to understand the sweetness of sugarcane. “Since the BJP came to power in the state, festivals were celebrated peacefully and even Covid was defeated. This is the picture of new Uttar Pradesh and we made the state riot free as not even a single riot has taken place in the last 4 years. BJP killed the terrorists after entering their den,” he said. CM Yogi warned people against being misled by opposition as they have dual character and change their colour fast. He said, “Congress, Bua (BSP) and Babua (SP) got enough chances to do development but earlier very less work was done for development. During 4 .5 years only in Gonda, we provided PM Awas to 42,000 people.” Comparison his government and others, the CM said, “Before 2017, there was no arrangement for purchasing farmers’ produce and farmers were committing suicide. Under the guidance of PM Modi, the picture changed in the state and sugar mills are making timely payments. In Gonda district only, more than 92,000 quintal wheat was purchased. Before 2017 ration used to go to Saifai and people were not getting free ration, vaccines, homes, toilets, electricity and corona test.

Source claimed that an assistant conservator of forest rank officer is conducting the inquiry and departmental inquiry will be initiated only if substance is found in the allegations. Five foresters including round officer and forest guards have been sent on forced leave, pending primary inquiry against them, said sources.Durgapur police have registered FIR against two forest guards for alleged inhuman torture of seven suspects by foresters of Chandrapur range. Six dalits and a tribal, who were detained on poaching charges, have charged foresters with thrashing and giving electric shock to them during detention. Entire village had turned against the forest team when on Thursday evening it took the suspects for recovering remains of the poached animal and other evidences on Friday evening. Intervention by police helped the forest team to leave the village but without the suspects. As per sources the forest department appears to on sticky wicket as no primary offence report (POR) has been registered in the poaching so far. The foresters have also failed to recover any body part or meat of the spotted deer, which they suspected to have been poached with an electrified wire in Chicholi fields. Durgapur police maintained that only two accused, namely forest guard Vijay Bhimanwar and Gulab Yadav have been booked. There is possibility that more foresters could be booked as the investigations progresses. Complainants could remember names of only a few foresters. The complaint given to superintendent of police has names of forest guard Bhimanwar, Yadav along with round officer Ramesh Kumar Tawade and RFO Rahul Karekar. SP Arvind Salve visited Durgapur police station on Saturday and took details about the investigation.Durgapur PSO Swapnil Dhule said that they have neither added more accused nor an any section in the case. “Detailed statement from complainants are being taken.

---||Varanasi||UP wants ‘baba’, not ‘bua’ or ‘babua’, says Rajnath||Revised Jaunpur: Claiming that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will retain power in Uttar Pradesh with a “three-fourth majority”, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday strongly endorsed Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for a second term, saying that the state does not want “bua or babua”, apparently referring to Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati and Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav, but wants only “baba” (Yogi) in 2022. “I don’t like calling anyone ‘babua’ or ‘bua’. I also don’t have an objection if some people relate themselves by becoming ‘bua’ and ‘babua’. However, the relationships forged in the past have now been broken. People have made their mood that ‘na babua chahiye, na bua chahiye, UP me sirf ‘baba’ chahiye (neither babua nor bua is needed, UP needs only baba)”, said Rajnath while sharing the strategy of 30,286 booth in-charges and other office-bearers from 16 districts of Kashi region unit of BJP to counter the campaign of rivals at TD College ground here on Saturday. On Centre’s decision to repeal the three farm laws, Rajnath said that “the previous governments used to open fire on farmers to crush their movements, but the BJP has always been sensitive towards the farmers and that is why Prime Minister Narendra Modi is taking back these laws”. “BJP sees the farmers as ‘annadata’ (people who feed the country). We passed the three farm laws in the interest of the farmers. But, when a section of farmers continued to stir on the issue, the PM took the decision to repeal it. On the very first day of the forthcoming parliamentary session, the formality of repealing the laws would also be completed on the floor of the House. Everybody has seen how previous governments crushed the movements of farmers and even opened fire and rained canes on them. But, the BJP-led government has handled them decencently and politely,” he added. Targeting the SP chief for taking credit for Jewar Airport, Rajnath taunted, “Some people are not scared even of God in their bid to take credit of others’ work and claim that others are cutting ribbons of their work. It is on record that when I was CM of UP in 2001, I had forwarded the proposal of Jewar Airport. Neither the SP nor BSP government could go ahead to actualise the project.” “Except the regime of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the history of all other governments is full of scams and corruption. A former PM Rajiv Gandhi had expressed helplessness in putting a check on corrupt practices. There should be a clear intention to check corruption. BJP has shown how the country is governed by putting a check on corruption.” “How weak were Congress-led government is being exposed by its own senior leaders like Manish Tiwari, who in his recent book has mentioned that no desired action was taken against Pakistan after 26/11 terror attack on Mumbai,” said Rajnath. He added, “After Uri and Balakot terror attacks, India proved that it can also teach lessons to the perpetrators by crossing over the border.” Rajnath said India does not believe in attacking others or capturing their land. “With its actions, the Modi government has proved that India is now a powerful nation and will give a befitting reply to any bid of violating its territory by anyone,” he said. Praising the work done by Yogi in the state, Rajnath said, “Yogi Ji has led UP miraculously as the state’s economy has doubled in the past four and half years. Investment of Rs 4.75 lakh crores for industrial and other developments has come here, UP has ranked second in ease of doing business, infrastructure has developed massively and Yogi Ji’s strategy for tackling Covid-19 is being recognised by the WHO.” “Nobody had imagined that Brahmos missiles and AK-203 rifles would be manufactured in UP, but it has become possible now. All these industrial developments have become possible due to improving law and order in the state,” said Rajnath, mentioning how criminal and mafia elements are scared of Yogi. He also targeted the opposition, saying that “as it is finding no issue, it is digging a graveyard and breaking bottles to bring out Jinnah (Pakistan’s founder).” Regarding the viral photo of Modi putting his hand on the shoulders of Yogi, Rajnath said, “I am telling you what the PM was saying to Yogi JI. Yogi Ji was asked to bat like a master blaster as he had no threat of getting hurt or hit wicket.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/up-wants-baba-not-bua-or-babua-says-rajnath/articleshow/87954918.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

To be constructed at the cost of around Rs 35 lakh, the centre will help educate visitors about the unique and endemic flora and fauna inside the Mhadei’s forest, which is also home to the tiger. Besides this, the extension of the floating jetty inside the Salim Ali Wildlife sanctuary is also planned. “This will be the first nature education centre inside Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary. It will inform and educate visitors about the various life inside the sanctuary, without having to enter the forest,” said deputy conservator of forests, North Goa, (wildlife division), Arulraj Jabestin. He said at Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary, a floating jetty was added for the first time last year. This is being extended further to be able to park the three boats of the forest department, which are used for patrolling the sanctuary as well as to take visitors on bird watching trips. The existing education centre at Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary is also being expanded, Jabestin said. Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary is home to the largest number of sacred groves in Goa, which are preserved patches of forests lying untouched for centuries due to the sacred status allotted to them by locals. The sanctuary also has limestone caves and rock art at Brahmakarmali, besides Myristica swamp forests. Visitors will be able to learn about all these unique features of the sanctuary at the nature education centre being set up at Maloli in the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary. Expansion of nature education centres at Netravali Wildlife Sanctuary and at Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary are also planned. Netravali sanctuary is Goa’s biggest with an area of 211 sqkm. Cotigao sanctuary, with an area of 80 sqkm, is home to a butterfly park, Goa’s only such state-run park.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/nature-education-centre-at-mhadei-sanctuary-soon/articleshow/87955029.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Wearing scarf, not mask? NMC, police likely to fine Rs 500||NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and traffic police are likely to levy a penalty of Rs500 on people wearing handkerchief/scarf instead of mask to comply with the latest order of the state government. Women TOI spoke to have raised objection on the new rule. The government on Saturday issued fresh guidelines further relaxing restrictions on timings and activities related to economic, cultural, social, sports and entertainment in an effort to bring pre-Covid like normalcy. The government has made full vaccination mandatory and issued a set of few new norms. The government guidelines say handkerchief will not be considered as mask and person using it would be liable for fine. NMC will implement the government directives. “We will also give powers to police department to take action in this regard,” additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI. Activist Sushma Kamble feels it’s government’s way of promoting companies manufacturing masks. “Our experience in the last one-and-a-half year is that scarf prevents from contracting the disease. Long scarves used by majority of the girls and women are far better than cloth mask being sold on streets. Decisions should be taken in interest of people, not companies,” she said. As per young advocate Anjali Ahuja, it will cause inconvenience to girls. “Most of the girls wear scarf to avoid sunburn on face and heavy dust in the city. Girls wear proper long scarf covering hair, face and neck. It will become difficult to breathe if both scarf and mask are to be worn at a time. Also, it will be difficult if any NMC staffer or traffic police ask them to remove scarf to check whether a mask has been worn or not,” she said and added this rule needs to be set aside. While terming the decision on not considering handkerchief a mask as proper, infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said the guidelines should be more scientific. “Government should make wearing N-95 mask mandatory as it prevents a person from contracting the disease, especially in case of mutated variants, and in indoors,” he said. Welcoming the government’s decision, young activist Shashank Gattewar said guidelines should be implemented and not remain only on paper. “It will also help in protecting senior citizens as most of them wear only a small handkerchief. Masks purchased from medical shops and worn in a proper manner by covering nose and mouth is must,” he said. The new guidelines have allowed 50% of capacity in closed spaces and 25% for outdoors. Consultant physician and intensivist Dr Nikhil Balankhe said it needs to be the other way round. “Chances of transmission are high indoors. Droplets stay for longer time indoors where people come very close to each other. Outdoor capacity should be more,” he said. The government has discontinued all previous orders issued for restrictions during the pandemic. It is not clear whether coaching classes, swimming pools, boating, water parks and pre-primary schools will reopen. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B said, “We will take appropriate decision after deliberations on the latest order and considering the mutation in variant. Order will be issued on Monday,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/wearing-scarf-not-mask-nmc-police-likely-to-fine-rs500/articleshow/87954428.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Experiential ‘STREET’ tourism to be launched in 7 districts||T’PURAM: Kerala tourism will soon launch the ‘STREET’ project at select spots in seven districts. STREET is an acronym for sustainable, tangible, responsible, experiential, ethnic, tourism hubs. By taking tourism to the unexplored rural hinterland, the initiative would help visitors to experience the diversity of life and culture of locals. In the first phase, the project would be implemented in Kadalundi in Kozhikode, Thrithala and Pattithara in Palakkad, Pinarayi and Ancharakkandi in Kannur, Maravanthuruthu and Manchira in Kottayam, Valiyaparamba in Kasaragod, Kanthalloor in Idukki and Chekadi in Wayanad. The project, conceived by the responsible tourism mission, is inspired by the ‘Tourism for Inclusive Growth’ slogan of the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). The project would be officially launched in Kozhikode on Sunday. Green street, cultural street, village life experience street, experiential tourism street, agri-tourism street, water street and art street are the themes that have been planned as part of the project. These streets will be in tune with the peculiarities of each of these locations and would focus on experiential tourism. Tourism minister PA Mohamed Riyas said the project offers a huge potential for growth in the tourism sector and would usher in significant changes. “It aims to present the unique identity of our state infront of travellers. It will foster mutually-beneficial organic relationships between tourism development in the state and the ordinary lives of people,” he claimed. Dr V Venu, additional chief secretary, department of tourism, said the project is a model for decentralized tourism development, and it would help bring little-known rural destinations to the mainstream and create more jobs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/experiential-street-tourism-to-be-launched-in-7-districts/articleshow/87954946.cms||---
---||Delhi||‘Local mentorship driving Business Blaster’||New Delhi: It is not just university students from various states who are guiding the students of Delhi government schools in transforming their ideas into enterprises, but also entrepreneurs living in the vicinity of the school. Calling the concept “local mentorship”, deputy chief minister and education minister Manish Sisodia revealed how the entire community has been involved to make a success of Delhi government’s Business Blaster programme in its schools. Stating that the government hadn’t expected to receive such a good response, Sisodia revealed to TOI that the second stage of the Business Blaster programme was under way now. “The first intervention was to build a team and create an idea. The children have to prove that they are ready to put the seed money to good use. The first barrier is crossed when this is done,” said Sisodia. “Now, we are at the second stage in the Business Blaster programme where we are requesting investors for more funds to help the students’ business grow.” Under the programme, students of classes XI and XII in Delhi government schools are given seed money to start a business. A pilot project was carried out in the School of Excellence, Khichripur, where several students were each given Rs 1,000 after presenting their enterprise ideas. With the pilot proving students can multiply the inputs, they are now being given seed money of Rs 2,000 each. Since the launch of the programme, the government has received 50,485 ideas from 3.5 lakh students. Each student has to submit a no-objection certificate from their parents before starting a project. Sisodia added, “The school has been given the responsibility of the programme. The school management committee also chips in to bring local entrepreneurs to coach the students.” The state government will also hold a Business Blaster mela in which student entrepreneurs can compete among themselves. The ones finishing at the top will be given direct admission to different state universities for higher studies. “The winners will not have to go through entrance exams or competition, but will be eligible for direct admission,” said Sisodia. “Even if they are only in Class XI at the moment, their seat will be secured in institutions like Delhi Technological University, Ambedkar University Delhi and IGDTUW for a course of their choice.” Even after they leave school, the students will be able to continue with the projects at the incubation centres in the universities. As for incubation centres in schools, Sisodia said, “I don’t think such facilities are required at the school level.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/local-mentorship-driving-business-blaster/articleshow/87954954.cms||Shradha Chettri

They used to target a particular community and lured them in the name of ‘halal investment’. A surveillance team of Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) West, BBGTS Murthy, has nabbed four persons from Bengaluru. “So far, in the interrogation, the matter of cheating of about Rs 2,003 crores has come to light from more than 3,000 people from different cities across the country. The interrogation of the accused is going on,” said DCP (West) BBGTS Murthy. The accused persons had lured people to double the amount in four months by opening a fake company named Ambidant Marketing Pvt Ltd in Bengaluru. “In this, the accused after duping Rs 3 crores from Kanpur’s shoe trader Lucky Singh and about Rs 2,000 crores from about 3,000 people across the country, had fled after closing the company,” DCP added. An FIR has been lodged by Singh at the Bajaria police station under sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of Indian Penal Code against the accused,” said official further. The police said that nearly six cases are registered at different police stations of Bengaluru. “Property of about Rs 70 crores of the said Ambidant Marketing Private Limited Company had already been seized by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in Bengaluru. A case was registered in the police stations of Bengaluru, DJ Halli, accepting the application of all 3,000 people in a single case,” said DCP further. The accused were absconding since the registration of the case and were living in different places across the country. DCP had deployed his surveillance team to investigate the matter. The four arrested accused have been identified as Syed Farid, Syed Afaq, Syed Ammar and Nabeela Mirza. “Legal action is being taken in this regard by the Bajaria police station,” said police further. To recall, following an FIR , a team of city police had conducted a raid at a hideout in Bengaluru and arrested one of the accused Syed Khizar Husain from Bengaluru on March 24, 2021. According to the official sources, the firm was involved in collecting money from the customers by offering huge returns to the extent of up to 12% a month. The money is collected through electronic mode/cheque/cash. However, the company was not registered with the RBI nor with the SEBI under their Collective Investment Scheme. From inception on December 20, 2016, the company has so far received huge investments worth Rs 2,000 crore under various plans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/inter-state-gang-of-cheats-who-duped-3000-people-of-more-than-rs-2000-crore-busted/articleshow/87954941.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

---||Trichy||Rain abates, but flooded rivers keep Trichy neighbourhoods inundated||Trichy: Trichy city has not witnessed any heavy rainfall in the past 48 hours, yet several residential neighbourhoods are under water and residents cut-off from the rest of the city. Rivers passing through the city are in spate thanks to copious rain in the catchment areas comprising rural parts of Trichy and Pudukottai districts. This has led to waterlogging in the residential areas abutting the rivers. The city had received only an average 34 mm rainfall on Friday and Saturday. However, several localities including Karumandapam, Pirattiyur, Dheeran Nagar, Vayalur road, Kuzhumani road and parts of Woraiyur were submerged. To ensure safety, electricity distribution was disconnected at several localities where water stagnated. Trichy corporation was forced to prepare food at the common kitchen at K Abishekapuram zonal office for 4,000 residents stranded at their residences who were unwilling to relocate to relief centres.The inundation in multiple localities that did not receive heavy rainfall has turned the spotlight on lapses in water management. While Kudamurutti river that has a discharge of about 25,000 cusecs as of Saturday evening has flooded parts of Woraiyur and Vayalur road, the overflowing Koraiyar river has breached near Panjapur. Similarly, Ariyar river that collects surplus water from Manapparai and Ponnaniyar has virtually caused a deluge in Dheeran Nagar and Pirattiyur residential localities on the outskirts. In Karumandapam, the overflowing Kollankulam tank water, heading to Koraiyar caused flooding of Dindigul NH. “Since there was no rain in the city and discharge from Mettur dam was under control, Trichy luckily avoided a major flood which could have disrupted normal life. As the rivers flowing through the city are in full capacity, the surplus water from residential localities are not draining into the rivers,” an official source with PWD said. Residents of Kuzhumani road covering Vins Anbu Avenue, Selvam Nagar and Lingam Nagar in ward 60 blamed Trichy corporation for their miseries. Encroachments in the drainage canals were cited as a reason for the inundation.“Had the civic body concentrated on stormwater drains, the inconvenience could have been avoided to an extent. Our area is regularised and we have paid development fee, yet no amenities were provided,” P Mathivanan, a resident of Vins Anbu Avenue, said. Trichy corporation officials said that temporary measures to streamline the drains are under way to bring down the surplus water. Meanwhile, a tamarind tree that fell over Karur NH disrupted traffic for a few hours before PWD workers removed it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/rain-abates-but-flooded-rivers-keep-trichy-neighbourhoods-inundated/articleshow/87955511.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Trichy||Congress MP terms rising fuel prices a BJP conspiracy||Trichy: The BJP-led central government is conspiring against the people of the country by increasing the prices of fuel and essential commodities, Trichy MP Su Thirunavukkarasar said here on Saturday. “Whenever the central government needs money, it will increase the price of the fuels, gas and essential commodities. Recently, the BJP faced defeats in bypolls in some states, so they reduced the price of petrol and diesel by Rs 5 to Rs 10 per litre. Since the elections are round the corner in some states, they are reducing the price,” Thirunavukkarasar told reporters after leading a rally in the city against the price hike. The Congress MP slammed the central government for keeping the price of petrol and diesel high despite the dip in the price of the crude oil in the international market. He also said that rest of the neighbouring countries kept the price of the petrol and diesel between Rs 50 and Rs 55. Thirunavukkarasar also recalled how the BJP protested when the petrol and diesel were between Rs 45 and Rs 50 during the Congress regime. On the water stagnation across the state due to the rains, Thirunavukkarasar blamed the previous AIADMK government for not taking preventive measures by clearing the waterways.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/congress-mp-terms-rising-fuel-prices-a-bjp-conspiracy/articleshow/87955507.cms||---

Instead of diverting the collected surplus water to RWH storage wells, the disconnected pipelines discharging rainwater at a significant height is causing erosion of the service roads of the RoB and forming potholes in them.Trichy junction RoB, that was partly commissioned for vehicular movement in 2016 and 2018, has a network of RWH pipelines that collects and diverts rainwater from the Dindigul road arm, Madurai road arm and central bus stand arm to storage wells beneath the RoB. Unlike the other old RoBs in the city, the RWH system at Trichy junction RoB had prevented water inundation in the adjoining areas. However, for the past few years as there was no maintenance and with the projects wing of the state highways department yet to hand over the facility to the maintenance wing for periodical renovation, the RWH pipes were not in good shape.As PVC pipes were used to interconnect the water-collecting points, the weathering PVC pipes develop cracks at multiple spots. In the recent rain, rainwater falling from the RoB at about 50-60 feet from the ground has led to the service roads connecting Karumandapam, district collector office road and Central bus stand developing potholes. “The stagnant water expedites the deterioration of the road layers due to wear and tear. The purpose of RWH also remains unsolved,” T Anand, a resident of E Pudur said. State highways department (projects) wing said the damaged PVC pipes will be replaced with suitable pipes of a different long-durable material to avoid such inconvenience. “We will renovate the RWH network and the vacant area beneath the arms of the RoB will be streamlined by fencing to avoid encroachment,” an official with state highways told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/faulty-rwh-system-at-trichy-junction-rob-damages-roads-nearby/articleshow/87955515.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Navi-mumbai||Maharashtra: Now, full vaccination must for all public transport, gatherings, services||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government on Saturday issued new rules making full vaccination—14 days since the second dose—mandatory to board any mode of public transport, not just trains, and for entry into most public places such as malls, shops, gatherings, ticketed or non-tickets events and any establishment where the public has the right to services. It is already mandatory for the employees of these establishments to be fully vaccinated. The government has also stressed on adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour and decided on penalties for drivers and conductors of public transport and office management in case any person is found violating norms such as wearing of masks. The individual flouting the rule will be fined too. The full vaccine mandate was earlier restricted to train travel and to some public places such as malls and certain government offices. Senior officials said the new restrictions have been added to push people to get fully vaccinated. Nearly 70% of the eligible population has been covered with the first dose and 40% is fully vaccinated. There are nearly 97 lakh people, though, who are due for their second dose and are yet to take it. BMC chief I S Chahal said the municipal body and the police should take stern action against those who do not wear proper masks. Handkerchief is not a mask and will invite a fine. “Emphasis should be placed on giving access to public places only to those citizens who have received both the doses. Strict action should be taken against employees of various establishments, shops, malls and movie theatres if they have not been vaccinated. Just as the target for the first dose of Covid vaccine has been met in Mumbai, now the target for the second dose needs to be met urgently,” Chahal said.  “The onus on proving his fully vaccinated status will be on the passenger. If caught, he will be fined Rs 500,” said a senior official. Several districts have already put such restrictions in place to increase their vaccination uptake. With the wedding season approaching, the state government has kept the 50% capacity rule for enclosed spaces such as theatres and marriage halls, but they have allowed open-to-sky venues, including grounds for political rallies and stadiums, to open at 25% capacity. The state also plans to monitor gatherings, which have more than 1,000 people. Open air lawns which were earlier allowed at a 50% capacity for weddings will halve numbers to 25%. In case total attendance exceeds 1,000, organisers must inform the district disaster management authority which will send its officials to ensure compliance to Covid norms, and in case of violation may order closure of part or the full venue, said the notification. “This notification aims to caution everyone that Covid-19 is still around and people need to be careful. The marriage season is on. Four lakh weddings are expected in Maharashtra alone and 25 lakh in the country. Caution is necessary,” chief secretary Sitaram Kunte told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-now-full-vax-must-for-all-public-transport-gatherings-services/articleshow/87961339.cms||---

---||Nagpur||‘Vaxxed or not, keep following Covid protocols to keep Omicron threat at bay’||Nagpur: Though it is too early to predict the extent of the threat posed by the new coronavirus strain Omicron in India, doctors said citizens don’t need to panic but at the same time rigorously follow Covid-apt behaviour. Several nations have pressed the panic button following detection of the new variant B1.1.529 in South Africa while the WHO declared it as a variant of concern. Like the Delta variant, Omicron is believed to be more or equally virulent as it was found to have 30 mutations in spike protein. The Delta variant, which too was declared VoC by WHO, had about 13 mutations in spike protein and was blamed for the ravaging second wave.. Dr Sushant Meshram, head of department of pulmonology, GMCH, said the new variant has immune escape mechanism. “It’s entry can’t be ruled out but we will fight this strain. Whether one is vaccinated or unvaccinated, you need to keep following all basic precautions. This is the only way to prevent the spread of the infection. Immuno compromised people need to be more careful. Kids, comorbid and elderly must take extra precaution,” he said. The previous waves have taught a lot of things. “We can better manage the disease now,” he added. Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said there is no need to panic but wait and watch. “As of now, only a four-day surveillance data is available. Majority of those affected by the new variant were unvaccinated. Last year, similar concerns were expressed when new strains were reported from Brazil and South Africa. Everyone thought they would be more deadly while it was Delta which created havoc. A virus can have 100 to 1,000 or more mutations. We still don’t know how much virulent this strain would be,” he said, adding, vaccination and booster doses are the key. Pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik, a district task force member, said the potential of a new variant is uncertain. “If spurts are reported from any part of the country then we need to put restrictions on travel, to and from that region. There is no harm in imposing restrictions for some time,” he said. Dr Meena Mishra, professor and head, department of microbiology, AIIMS, Nagpur, said the new variant is a variant of concern and is due to mutations in the spike protein. “It is associated with increased risk of reinfection. The strains from Bostwana have shown to have high viral load. Evolved from immunocompromised host and it may exhibit immune escape mechanism in which case vaccine may not affect. Right now it is associated with the upsurge in the cases in South Africa, Hong Kong etc,” she said. Dr Mishra added, “It can cause infection in Nagpur especially from the travellers of the affected areas. Of course we need to be cautious and follow stringent measures to tackle it especially in the elderly population where there may be waning immunity. Tracking, tracing and treating is the key! No need to panic.” Critical care specialist Dr Imran Noor Mohammad said though the vaccination rate has increased and a large number of people infected, it remains uncertain to predict the nature of the new variant. “It might create havoc. It is said the new variant is evading immunity. So there are 50-50 chances,” he said. Internal medicine specialist Dr Mohan Nerker too said it is difficult to predict right now. “Once the variant enters India, it needs to be seen how it will affect the vaccinated population. Till then, we need to stay protected. Mask is good a protection mechanism and even better than vaccine. It also saves one from other infections,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vaxxed-or-not-keep-following-covid-protocols-to-keep-omicron-threat-at-bay/articleshow/87954457.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Goa||Kala Academy a public bldg, govt must disclose repair plans: CCF||Panaji: The Charles Correa Foundation (CCF) has expressed concerns regarding the lack of transparency in the works undertaken at the Kala Academy, Panaji. This comes a day after the government told the high court of Bombay at Goa that the ongoing Rs 39 crore structural repairs and renovation work of Kala Academy was awarded without following the regular tendering process. The CCF has demanded that a full disclosure of the repair works be shared on a public platform. “The whole opacity of the project is very troubling and is not in the spirit of the Kala Academy, which in itself is a public building,” a CCF spokesperson told TOI. “There are several questions that still need to be answered in a public forum by the government about the methodology and technology to be used. Since the Kala Academy is a public building, all of the information needs to be public knowledge so that a proper review can be conducted,” he added. The work was awarded to Techton Buildcons Pvt Ltd on May 3, 2021, at a cost of Rs 39.6 crore plus taxes. A PIL was filed by Durgadas Kamat, who is seeking quashing and setting aside of the work order, while demanding that the government undertake a tender process for the work. Kamat had said that there were other contactors who could have taken up the work if it was tendered. “A public disclosure by the government about what they are planning to do with the Kala Academy is the need of the hour. That is the only way to find a good solution to the problem,” the CCF said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kala-academy-a-public-bldg-govt-must-disclose-repair-plans-ccf/articleshow/87955071.cms||---

They said Mini had played a pivotal role in maintaining NIT Trichy as the leading institute among all the 31 NITs for the past six years.Periodical recruitment drive to increase the human resource had helped the institute improve the ranking consistently in National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) conducted by the union ministry of education, they said. In the past few years, 119 faculty members including 27 women, 21 group ‘A’ cadre officers and 92 other staff were recruited by the institute.The strategic plan (2019-24) implemented by the outgoing director had improved the NIRF ranking of NIT Trichy from rank 12 to rank 9 (engineering category) and the overall ranking from rank 34 to rank 23 in the NIRF 2021, they said.“One of the crucial developments made was improvising the alumni-institute relationship. A new post, dean (alumni relations) was created to augment support from alumni for the institute’s development. The efforts will be sustained as a heritage centre was opened in the campus,” Mini told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/nit-ts-first-woman-director-completes-term-on-a-high-note/articleshow/87955532.cms||---
---||India||J&K men made to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’, attacked||RANCHI: Three Kashmiri traders doing business in Ranchi were allegedly beaten up on Saturday after being waylaid on their way to work and asked to chant "Jai Shri Ram" and "Pakistan Murdabad". Based on a complaint, the police arrested three out of the 20 to 25 people accused of targeting the traders near Kadru bridge in Ranchi's Doranda area. This is the second time in just over a fortnight that Kashmiris have been attacked in the same area. On November 11, two youths from J&K had been allegedly assaulted there, leading to the arrest of a resident. Rayaz Ahmad Wani, one of the complainants, said his colleagues Tanvir Ahmad Shah and Sartaj Ahmad Shah were ferrying woollen clothes by autorickshaw while he was on a two-wheeler when a "mob" surrounded them and demanded that they chant the slogans given to them. "I was hit on the head with a rod. Had I not been wearing a helmet, I might have been killed," he said. "They also thrashed my colleagues and damaged my scooter." The trio arrested for the attack were identified as Deepak Jha, Tarun Kumar and Arvind Kumar. Sadar DSP Prabhat Ranjan Barwar, who visited the area later, said the administration would prepare lists of Kashmiri traders living in various parts of the city and hand these over to the respective police stations to ensure their security. "A meeting of elected representatives, peace committee members and social activists will be held to raise awareness."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jk-men-made-to-chant-jai-shri-ram-attacked/articleshow/87956137.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Madurai||Madurai college invents wireless system to monitor, remove sewage blocks in UGD||Madurai: Researchers from a self-financing engineering college in Madurai have invented and patented a new system by which people can wirelessly monitor and identify blocks in underground drainage and also remove them.A team of researchers from KLN College of Engineering have developed the system as part of a project sanctioned by the department of science and technology (DST), Government of India, in 2018 under the Technology Development Transfer (TDT) scheme. Dr K N K Ganesh, secretary and correspondent, K N K Karthik, president and Dr A V Ram Prasad, principal, encouraged a team of professors comprising Dr S Parthasarathy, Dr D Pradeep Kannan and Prof S Nallathambi to propose the research project titled ‘Design and development of sensor-based sewage block remover and management system’. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the project was delayed by eight months.The prototype is a combination of wireless monitoring and portable sewage block remover. “At the bottom of a manhole, laser sensors are placed. It can reach up to 3 meters or 21 feet in depth whereas the depth of the manhole is around 12-15 ft. Two sensors are placed for different levels and the depth level will be monitored. If there is any block, the level at one manhole will rise and at another manhole it will be down. So with the difference of these signals, we can figure out the location of the block,” explained Parathasarathy, principal investigator. This can be monitored remotely, since wireless transmission is being integrated with IoT controllers and data uploaded in the cloud.A control box is set up, which will receive signals from the sensors placed in all manholes in an area. “Each sensor will have a unique ID and then wireless data from the control box can be transmitted. For example, the graphical user interface website of a city corporation, which is usually used to monitor water flow at pumping stations. The sensors alert if there is a block and as the level rises, an alarm and warning is issued. Engineers would be able to monitor through their mobile phones,” said the professor. The system also comprises an underground sewage inspection camera and a portable vehicle device to identify and remove any block in the sewer. The camera will identify the nature of the sewage block whereas the portable device, which has a generator and motor, will make use of a flexible shaft to clear a block by flushing it out. This innovation has been patented in Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), India. “We have already spoken to corporationccommissioner KP Karthikeyan. Once we can test the system, we will understand whether there are any practical difficulties,” said Parthasarathy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-college-invents-wireless-system-to-monitor-remove-sewage-blocks-in-ugd/articleshow/87954961.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Ranchi||Four trapped in Bokaro mine for over 24 hours||BOKARO: Four people are trapped after an abandoned coal mine of Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL) where they went inside for illegal mining collapsed. The incident happened late on Friday evening at the mine located in Parbatpur coal block under Amalabad police outpost and a BCCL special unit were unable to trace them even after 24 hours of the collapse. No formal complaint was filed with the police by the family members so far fearing legal action. The incident came to light only after a few villagers told their colleagues about the incident. DC Kuldeep Kumar Chaudhary said an NDRF team was called in for a rescue operation. SP Chandan Kumar Jha said, “We have informal information about four persons being trapped in the sudden mine subsidence. BCCL has sent a rescue team. We are looking into the matter.” Local MLA from Chandankyari, Amar Bauri, other leaders and administrative officials have visited the spot to assess the situation. Bauri said, “I have informed the DC about the status. He assured that the NDRF team will reach here on Sunday.” He further said, “The Parbatpur coal mine where the incident happened is abandoned and belongs to BCCL. The locals sometimes enter it to collect coal for domestic use. It seems the four of them had gone to pick up coal when a coal layer suddenly collapsed and they got trapped inside. “The persons trapped inside could be Laxman Rajwar, Ravana Rajwar, Anadi Singh and Bharat Singh. Their family members have told me that they were missing after the incident. A few villagers also claimed that they had heard their voices inside the mine.” The MLA added, “Whether they are involved in illegal activities this is a secondary matter. The administration should first take serious steps to save their lives. At the spot, a crack is visible indicating subsidence.” The DC, however, said, “So far, we do not have clear-cut information about the matter. Whether any person is trapped inside or not is also not confirmed. The BCCL rescue team is also not able to report on anything conclusive. We have handed over the operation to the NDRF.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/four-trapped-in-bokaro-mine-for-over-24-hrs-ndrf-to-start-op-today/articleshow/87954741.cms||Divy Khare

---||Ranchi||Sobaran Soren assassinated for agitation against moneylenders||RAMGARH: Sobaran Soren, the father of JMM founder Shibu Soren and grandfather of chief minister Hemant Soren, was assassinated by moneylenders in Lukaiyatand forest, nearly 16km away from Gola block headquarters under the then undivided Hazaribag district, on November 27, 1957. He was on his way to Gola from his house in Nemra village to meet his two sons — Rajaram Soren and Shibu Soren — living in a school hostel in Gola then. Fagu Besra, general secretary of JMM and hailing from Ramgarh district, said Sobaran was a government school teacher and a social worker who started tribal awareness campaigns against moneylenders in the locality. At that time, the moneylenders would exploit the Santhal tribals and forcibly loot paddy from their fields. Sobaran was killed when the exploitations were at their peak. Shibu was a 15-year-old school student when his father was killed and he took an oath to protect tribes against atrocities and exploitations. He had launched ‘Dhaan Kaato’ (Reap paddy) agitation as most of the tribals’ paddy fields were forcibly occupied by the moneylenders also known as Sudkhor Mahajan. Besra said the tribals were united under the dynamic leadership of a young Shibu and the agitation soon spread to Chhotanagpur plateau in south Bihar and the moneylenders were forced out of the villages. After launching a successful struggle to safeguard the Santhal tribes, Shibu along with Binod Bihari Mahto and A K Roy formed the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) during a public meeting at the golf ground in Dhanbad in 1973. The objective of JMM was to launch a struggle for a separate Jharkhand state as another struggle for a separate state led by Jaipal Singh since the 1930s under the banner of the Jharkhand Party became weak, Besra added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/sobaran-soren-assassinated-for-agitation-against-moneylenders/articleshow/87954733.cms||---

SP (Rural), Nathu Singh Meena, said that the police team comprising Dhalbhumgarh police station in charge, Avanish Kumar, and Ghatshila police station, in charge, Rukmini Kumari, left for Nellore on Saturday night. The police team from Jharkhand will meet their counterpart in Nellore, visit the factory site, inquire with the victim, question the accused, and collect details relating to the incident. The victim’s parents are also travelling to Nellore with the police. The SP said that Nellore district police superintendent has claimed that the girl retracted from her earlier allegations of rape when the local police reached the factory to probe. “Our police team will probe and know exactly what happened,” said the SP. "There are two versions to the story. Facts will be known when our team completes the probe." On Thursday, nearly 200 migrant workers, mostly woman, returned to Dhalbhumgarh from Nellore. They complained to the Dhalbhumgarh police that one of the fellow worker was raped by the site manager of the company. When they opposed and sought action against the culprit, they were fired by the company management and asked to leave the town immediately. Ghatshila MLA Ramdas Soren said he has urged the district administration to pursue the matter in a speedy manner. "Priority should be to rescue the girl. Legal action will follow subsequently," Soren said. He also added that the district labour department has been asked to take action against the agents who gave false promise of high salary to the villagers and took them to Nellore. Several of the migrants are girls between 12-22 age group, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/woman-labourer-rape-case-police-team-sent-to-ap-to-inquire-facts/articleshow/87954722.cms||B Sridhar

Their search finally ended on Wednesday thanks to the efforts of ‘Niradhar No Aadhar’, a Veraval-based NGO. Suffering from learning difficulties, Rajesh was 16-year-old when he got lost from his family during a train journey to Delhi. Rajesh’s brother and sister who came to Rajkot on Wednesday, broke down after seeing their sibling after so many years. After wandering for many years, Rajesh arrived at Veraval and around two months ago he got shelter at the ashram run by the NGO. “While being treated, one day he told us that he hails from Cuttack. We contacted the local police station there and reached Rajesh’s family with the help of cops,” said Dhruv Solanki, an official of the NGO.

In about 10 months from now, Faecal Sludge Treatment Plant (FSTP) and Construction and Demolition Waste Treatment Plant (CDWTP) will come up in the MNAC command area. "The FSTP will be constructed at an expected cost of Rs 3 crore, while CDWTP will be constructed at a cost of Rs 1 crore," said city manager, MNAC, Jeetender Kumar. Two separate tenders inviting bids for the construction of the two treatment plants were floated this week. By the next fortnight, construction work on the ground shall commence, added Kumar. Both the treatment plants will come up in the Mango area, two different sites for each of the plants have been tentatively identified but officials have refrained from going public with the announcement of the sites, as of now. The state urban development department has allocated funds for the construction of the treatment plants. "FSTP is an alternative to Solid Waste Treatment Plant, the effectiveness of the facility (FSTP) in disposing the faecal sludge is robust," the city manager said. With FSTP getting operational, the scope of dumping/releasing the human waste into the waterbodies will end Responding to a query, the official said CDW treatment plant is a potent facility to address daily issues of building and construction waste. "Tendency of the people to dump the construction waste on the roadside invite others to dump the house waste. This results in popping up of garbage heaps in the nooks of the colonies," Kumar said. He said that CDWTP will be handy in disposing the construction waste. The byproduct produced by the construction waste would be useful in the making of bricks, filling lands, etc, he said. With a population of over 2.5 lakh, the MNAC generates about 150 tonnes of domestic garbage daily. With regard to the faecal sludge, there's no concerete data with the municipal body. The MNAC official said that the other objective of setting up the two separate treatment plants is to improve the all India ranking in the swachhta survekshan in the future. In 2021 swachhta survekshan, MNAC scored 149 ranking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/mnac-to-build-2-treatment-plants-for-faecal-sludge-and-constrn-waste/articleshow/87954761.cms||B Sridhar

Police have arrested three persons, namely Deepak Jha, Tarun Kumar and Arvind Kumar, in connection with the incident. In a complaint lodged with the local police station, one of the victims, Rayaz Ahmad Wani, said two of his colleagues were proceeding towards Harmu with woollen clothes on an autorickshaw when 20 to 25 people surrounded them near the Kadru bridge. The mob asked them to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’ and ‘Pakistan Murdabad’. Wani said he informed police on receiving the information and went to the spot on his scooter. “As soon as I reached the place, one of the miscreants hit me on the head with a rod shattering my helmet. The assault could have easily killed me had I not worn my helmet. They also thrashed my colleagues and damaged my scooter. Our woollen clothes and important documents were also stolen from the autorickshaw.” He said his colleagues injured in the incident are Tanvir Ahmad Shah and Sartaj Ahmad Shah. “Several attacks on Kashmiri traders have taken place this year but we have ignored most of them hoping things to settle down. We regard Jharkhand as a peaceful state and have been coming for years here to sell our products. However, the frequent attacks have raised concerns about our security here,” he added. Earlier on November 11, two Kashmiri youths were beaten up in the Doranda area. Police had registered an FIR and arrested one person in connection with the crime. Sadar DSP Prabhat Ranjan Barwar, who visited the area, said the administration would prepare a list of Kashmiri traders present in different parts of the city and hand them over to the police stations concerned to ensure their security. “A meeting of elected representatives, peace committee members and social activists of the areas concerned would be held to increase public sensitivity on this issue. The locals should discourage these incidents and inform the police immediately if any such cases happen,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/3-kashmiri-traders-thrashed-forced-to-chant-jai-shri-ram/articleshow/87954692.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Ranchi||‘RJD state panel to be formed keeping in mind ’24 assembly polls’||Ranchi: RJD’s national general secretary Abdul Bari Siddiqui on Saturday said that there is no timeline for forming the new state committee in Jharkhand and it could be formed in a week or even a month. Siddiqui, who is on a personal visit to the state, was speaking to media persons at Birsa Munda International airport in Ranchi. He said that the new state unit would be formed keeping in mind the 2024 assembly election in Jharkhand. “The next committee would be formed with the objective of making RJD a strong force in Jharkhand,” he added. On November 24, RJD president Lalu Prasad on November 24 had dissolved the party’s state unit and all the cells in Jharkhand. Party leaders in Jharkhand had said that now the national president would appoint the new state president who, in turn, would constitute the state-level committee. The state president would appoint the heads of different cells barring a few. Outgoing state RJD president Abhay Singh, who was at the airport to welcome Siddiqui, said, “I have discharged the responsibilities assigned to me as state president in the best possible way and it was now up to the leadership to assess my performance.” Meanwhile, when asked about Lalu’s health, who was admitted to AIIMS, Delhi on Friday after getting down with fever, Siddiqui said, “His health has deteriorated but there is no cause of concern. I am hoping that he will be better soon.” Asked about RJD’s stance on liquor ban in Bihar, he said, “RJD supports liquor ban in Bihar but the present government has failed to check the rise of mafias involved in the illegal sale of liquor.” Recently, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar faced a lot of heat after several people died following the consumption of spurious liquor, though Bihar is a dry state. Referring to the recent raid on marriage ceremonies by police officials to check for liquor, Siddiqui said, “There is a large gathering of women in marriages and policemen should not storm such places suddenly. The CM should apologise and take action against such officials.” He added that the liquor ban policy in Bihar has caused more harm than good.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rjd-state-panel-to-be-formed-keeping-in-mind-24-assembly-polls/articleshow/87954743.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||All eligible persons to get social security pension irrespective of quota system: Hemant||Nemra (Ramgarh): Terming his government’s move to provide social security pension as a big step, chief minister Hemant Soren on Saturday said all eligible persons would get the pension irrespective of the reservation system in the state. Soren made the announcement during his visit to Lukaiyatand near his native village, Nemra, under the Gola block of Ramgarh district to attend the ‘64th Martyr Day’ of his grandfather ‘Sobaran Soren’ who was assassinated by moneylenders on this day in 1957. Addressing a public meeting in Lukaiyatand, the chief minister said there would be no quota system while giving the pension to elderly, women, widows and differently-abled persons. On the ‘Aapki Sarkar Apke Dwar’ programme, Soren said people need not worry about their grievances as camps were being organised frequently in panchayats by visiting district officials and panchayat representatives to resolve all their problems. The camps offer services including issues related to caste certificates, income certificates, Aadhaar card corrections, ration cards and social security pensions. Talking about migrant workers, unemployment and poverty, the chief minister said these issues have been Jharkhand's phenomena, but his government has started schemes to change the situation and skilled youths could start their own business with Rs 25-lakh loan the government is providing with subsidy. “We have started the Palash brand scheme for women self-help groups. This will help the groups as the products will be purchased by the government,” Soren said, stressing that the brand would be made a Rs 1,500-crore business in Jharkhand. He further said, “There is a potential of self-employment in the fishery segment as fish farming has been started by villagers in Chandil, Patratu and Maithan dam and in days to come, Jharkhand would be self-sufficient in fish production.” Talking about malnutrition among children as highlighted in the Niti Aayog report on the multidimensional poverty index, Soren said malnourished children would be given eggs six times a week which will be supplied from poultry farms run by the state’s villagers. Earlier, Soren arrived at Lukaiyatand by helicopter amid tight security cover from Gola to the meeting venue. He was warmly received by Ramgarh DC Madhavi Mishra and SP Prabhat Kumar. Soren then paid homage to his grandfather.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/all-eligible-persons-to-get-social-security-pension-irrespective-of-quota-system-hemant/articleshow/87954688.cms||N K Agarwal
---||Ranchi||Maoist posters, banners found in Saranda||Ranchi | Jamshedpur: After around 10 years, Maoist posters and banners were found in the Saranda forest in West Singhbhum district on Saturday demanding withdrawal of the Saranda Action Plan (SAP) and hailing activities of the People’s Liberation Guerilla Army (PLGA), the armed wing of the banned CPI (Maoist). The posters and banners were found on the street connecting Kiriburu to Chhotanagra and Barajamda. They were also found at Meena Bazaar bus stand in Megahataburu and at other places under Gua and Chhotanagra police station limits. Denouncing police action against the Maoists, the posters written in Hindi urged village youths to join the banned outfit in large numbers to take on the police. The posters said the PLGA’s 21st raising day will be observed between December 2 and 8. The police removed the posters and the banners on receiving information. Police and CRPF troops have intensified patrolling in the 850 square km forest area. Kiriburu sub-divisional police officer Ajit Kumar Kujur said search operations have been launched to identify and arrest those behind the posters. “We suspect some supporters of the outfit could be behind the act,” he said. It was in 2012 when Saranda under Manoharpur block had witnessed ultra activities after the killing of Maoist leader M Koteshwar Rao alias Kishanji on November 24, 2011, by Bengal police. Stray incidents of violence were followed by aggressive socio-political campaign against the rebels under the Saranda Action Plan by then Union minister Jairam Ramesh. Since then, the rebels preferred keeping a low profile and provided safe haven to Prashant Bose alias Kishan Da, who also headed the eastern regional bureau of CPI (Maoist). It was after his arrest on November 13 this year that the bureau has revived its activities. In another related incident, security forces exchanged gunfire with suspected PLFI men in Porahat forest in Gudri police station area on Friday. PLFI commander Dinesh Gope, who carries a reward of Rs 25 lakh, is said to have escaped from the spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/maoist-posters-banners-found-in-saranda/articleshow/87954676.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Fringe groups and underprivileged looked forward to winter session to be heard||NAGPUR: NCP leader Jwala Dhote had planned to take out a rally of female sex workers (FSWs) and transgenders to Vidhan Bhavan protesting against police action at the Ganga-Jamuna red light area. Another outfit—Sangharsh Vahini— also had plans of a rally taking up the cause of nomadic tribes. Dhote has put off her plans as the winter session would be held in Mumbai. Sangharsh Vahini still plans to hold a symbolic protest on December 22. The decision to hold the winter session in Mumbai instead of Nagpur is expected to affect a number of fringe groups and under privileged individuals wanting to voice their demands. Every year, such groups looked forward at the assembly session here as an opportunity to be heard. In 1994, a massive procession by the Gowari community demanding scheduled tribe (ST) status ended up in a stamped killing 114. Later in 2015, Dr Vikas Mahatme, now a Rajya Sabha MP from BJP, had led a rally of Dhangars (shepherd community) blocking roads with a similar demand. Both demands are yet to be met. Later, it was protests against CAA and NRC. If rallies or morchas as they are called locally have been a permanent feature of the Nagpur session. A number of individuals beeline at Hyderabad House — which makes up the secretariat. Some pitch their tent along Vidhan Bhavan hoping to get attention. Coming from the remotest parts of Vidarbha, people come up with smallest of matters hoping to meet a minister or a bureaucrat in a department. These includes demands to make roads in villages, transfers, hike in wages, payment of pension, to even non-cognizance of police complaints. Some cases are years old. “People living in remote parts of the region find Mumbai too far. The winter session in Nagpur gives them a chance to be heard. They line up to meet leaders or officers. Of course the leadership in Western Maharashtra remains apathetic,” said Dhote. Mumbai does not attract such crowds though the assembly functions there for the rest of the year. “We generally receive delegations over issues like failing cooperative societies or defaults. The complainants believe that taking up the matter during the winter session will help in prompt resolution,” said an official in the state’s cooperative department. “People come up with various issues of sundry nature. There are requests for regularization of employment, matters related to labour laws, regularisation of plots or lands to even proper rehabilitation,” said Vinay Sahare, a Congress worker. Officials and political workers accept that even as people pin hopes not much happens. Hardly any cognizance is taken of such complaints. “In 2013, we had taken out a rally against reduction of scholarship for students from OBCs and nomadic tribes. Within a week, the amount was restored,” said Mukund Adewar of Sangharsha Vahini. “The issues mainly related to the revenue and police department. For example, a group of farmers had come down to Nagpur as they had not received the subsidy for drip irrigation,” said Sahebrao Pawar, an activist from Yavatmal. “Middle-men make most of the situation as real issues re hardly dealt with and the winter session leads to waste of resources,” said Kishore Tiwari, chairman of Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavlamban Mission, a state government think tank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fringe-groups-and-underprivileged-looked-forward-to-winter-session-to-be-heard/articleshow/87955042.cms||Shishir Arya

There is a maha mantri whose name everybody is scared to take. (He is) Satish Dhond, referred to as the sanghatan mantri. Sawant is a puppet, Dhond is controlling everything. How is this person, who is not a minister, who hasn’t taken oath of secrecy, entering government meetings?” Moitra alleged while addressing reporters. Accusing BJP of nepotism, Moitra said that several projects in the tourism sector were being awarded to firms which are “in close cohoots” with Dhond. “Nobody dares to ask these questions in Goa because everybody is mixing with everybody.” Moitra further called into question the failure of both the Goa MPs in raising “a single Goa-specific issue” in parliament. She hit out against the government over the Rs 49 cr Kala Academy renovation controversy. She also demanded the demolition of the illegal structure built at an ASI-protected heritage site in Old Goa. “In April 2021, the existing structure, or the hut, was demolished and today, in November, an 840 sqm villa has been set up by Manish Munot who is associated with the BJP. I am asking this to the chief minister and the Prime Minister, how are you allowing this?” she said. Over the three Centre-sponsored linear infrastructure projects, Moitra cited the Central Empowered Committee report to the Supreme Court which states that there is “no justification of these projects in the protected area.” Alleging that all other parties have failed to take any issue to their successful resolution, Moitra said “What is the point of raising issues when nothing is being done about it. Congress has done nothing all these years. They raise an issue, but nothing happens on ground. Other parties in Goa are in cahoots with BJP. I promise to raise all these Goa-specific issues in Parliament next week.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-a-puppet-dhond-running-show-in-goa-claims-tmcs-moitra/articleshow/87955075.cms||---
---||Goa||Follow Parrikar's policy of tickets to minorities: Carlos||Vasco: Vasco BJP MLA and KTC chairman Carlos Almeida wants the party leadership to follow the policy followed by former chief minister Manohar Parrikar of giving adequate representation to minorities while deciding on tickets for the forthcoming 2022 elections. “In 2012, Parrikar gave importance to minorities (while selecting candidates) and BJP won 21 seats, a full majority on its own. He did it again in 2017. In 2019, when 10 Congress MLAs joined BJP, eight of them were from the minority community”, Almeida said addressing a press conference along with Vasco BJP functionaries. “Parrikar’s long term vision should be continued,” he said. “I wish to suggest that BJP should allocate at least 35% of the seats to Catholic candidates, which would send a signal to the minority communities that the party takes it seriously.”  In the 2017 elections, he said, although BJP won only 13 seats, most of its Catholic candidates won their seats. Almeida said that he has written to BJP’s national president JP Nadda reiterating the importance of wooing the minority community for the upcoming 2022 elections, as was done in 2012 and 2017. While expressing confidence that he would bag the party’s Vasco ticket for 2022, Almeida said that if things don’t work as planned, he would be compelled to take some harsh decisions, like Utpal Parrikar. “I will also be forced to think on those lines,” he said. “Vasco is basically a Congress seat. It was with then MLA Rajendra Arlekar that BJP managed to break the trend. We have been working hard to keep Vasco a BJP dominated constituency. Though NCP candidate Jose Philip D'Souza tried to push in, our efforts have paid off,” he said. Meanwhile, Vasco councillor in the Mormugao Municipal Council, Fredrick Henriques, said, “We are with Almeida no matter what. He has been the force behind our council election victory. We have already conveyed to the party leaders that we want the ticket for Almeida and that no outsider should be given the ticket.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/follow-parrikars-policy-of-tickets-to-minorities-carlos/articleshow/87955094.cms||---

Neighbours said around 2pm, the child was playing in the balcony of their flat in Dasnac society while his mother was arranging flowerpots there. The doorbell rang, and she went to the drawing room to receive a courier. When she returned, her son wasn't there. When she looked down, she saw the boy. He lay face down on the road, oozing blood. It is believed that the three-year-old stepped on to a stand meant to hang clothes and climbed on the balcony railing. He probably slipped and fell downstairs. Guards at the society and some residents heard the thud when the boy fell and rushed out to find the boy lying motionless on the road next to tower B. The little one was rushed to Neo Hospital in Sector 50, where he was declared dead on arrival. Police initially claimed that the boy may have slipped through the iron grilles of the balcony, but residents refuted it. They pointed out that the gap between two grilles isn't wide enough for a boy to pass through them. A resident of the society expressed concern about the height of the balcony railings. " We don't allow our kids to venture near the balcony," the resident said. Abhishek Chaubey, the maintenance in-charge of the society, said rules did not allow them to cover the balconies. "Usually, residents put a hard net in their balconies. The structural layout has been vetted by the Authority. Covering the balcony isn't allowed," he added. The boy's family had shifted to their flat in tower B just six months ago. They had also asked maintenance officials to cover the balcony, a neighbour said. On Friday evening, the family was too shocked to speak and requested to be left alone. Vinod Kumar Singh, the SHO of Sector 49 police station, said they were informed by the hospital authorities. "The child's mother is a homemaker and the father has a shop in Delhi's Chandni Chowk. A neighbour rushed the child to the hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/3-year-old-boy-falls-to-death-from-10th-floor-balcony/articleshow/87955265.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Goa||Revoke all permissions by Dec 3: GFP to Kavlekar||Panaji: GFP president Vijai Sardesai on Saturday said the government should immediately revoke all permissions given for construction of a bungalow at the heritage site at Old Goa by December 3. In a letter, Sardesai has asked deputy chief minister and town and country planning minister Chandrakant Kavlekar to let Goans know about the truth over the series of events and permissions “that were granted and not granted over this damaging structure”. The TCP’s conservation committee had given approval for construction of the bungalow at the site on October 7, 2016, and subsequently it had given technical clearance on October 18, 2016. At the time, late Francis D’Souza was TCP minister. Stating that construction of this structure began under Kavlekar’s leadership of TCP, the former TCP minister asked what stopped him from revoking permission for construction. “I strongly request you to come back to the people of Goa with the truth and if you and your government have indulged in wrong doings in 2016 and in 2021, then apologise by December 3,” the letter states. “This is not the first time that your full non-alliance BJP government has attempted to damage, destroy and discard the heritage structures around Old Goa. Earlier your government had plans to include the Ella village in Old Goa (right near the Se Cathedral) under the Greater Panaji ODP which would allow the permissible building height to be about 30m in various commercial zones as opposed to the 9m height restriction allowed in panchayat areas under the regional plan,” Sardesai said in the letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/revoke-all-permissions-by-dec-3-gfp-to-kavlekar/articleshow/87955173.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Following the launch of an agitation against the controversial bungalow, Lobo had on Wednesday said that he will be meeting the chief minister to urge him to withdraw the town and country planning department’s permission given for its construction, cautioning the government that the agitation would intensify if that was not done. “I have not yet met the chief minister, but have spoken to the state BJP president,” the minister told reporters on Saturday.“The party president said he’s already spoken to the TCP department and whatever steps need to be taken will be taken by following due procedure,” Lobo said. “There is a procedure. You can’t just withdraw the permission. If that is done the court will stay the order. There is a procedure: site inspection, showcause, personal hearing and withdrawal,” he said. “As per our knowledge, the permissions were given in 2016 and actual construction started in 2020. Licence was given for repair and reconstruction. We have to see if there is any violation of the NOC given,” he said. “I feel the TCP department will follow the due procedure and see to it that all the permissions granted are withdrawn. I will see that we take this case to the logical end. We will fight tooth and nail if required,” he said, adding that he will be meeting the chief minister shortly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/old-goa-bungalow-govt-must-follow-procedure-to-avoid-legal-tangle-says-lobo/articleshow/87955238.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||World||As African nations banned, SA says it’s ‘punishment’ for honesty||Nations in southern Africa protested bitterly on Saturday as more of the world’s wealthiest countries cut them off from travel, renewing a debate over border closures from the earliest days of the coronavirus pandemic and compounding the problems facing poorly vaccinated countries. The decision by countries to ban flights from southern Africa “is akin to punishing South Africa for its advanced genomic sequencing and the ability to detect new variants quicker,” the foreign affairs ministry said in a statement. “Excellent science should be applauded and not punished,” it added. “New variants have been detected in other countries. Each of those cases have had no recent links with Southern Africa,” yet the global “reaction to those countries is starkly different to cases in southern Africa.” South Africa’s healh ministry slammed the travel restrictions as “draconian”, “panic” and “misdirected” measures which go “against the norms and advice by the WHO”. “We feel some of the leadership of countries are finding scapegoats to deal with what is a worldwide problem,” said health minister Joe Phaahla. “Sometimes one gets punished for being transparent, and doing things very quick,” Tulio de Oliveira, a leading virologist who announced the discovery of the Omicron variant, said. Deputy director at the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), Ahmed Ogwell, added his disgust. “Stop this unscientific knee-jerk travel bans against #Africa,” tweeted Ogwell. “Use evidence for #covid19pandemic — public health measures, testing, vaccines. Travel bans is politics.” In poorer African nations, the cascade of travel closures triggered a wave of resentment among people who believed that the continent was yet again bearing the brunt of panicked policies from Western countries, which had failed to deliver vaccines and the resources needed to administer them. “Told you so,” said Francois Venter, a researcher at University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, referring to warnings from African researchers that delaying vaccinations there risked the emergence of new variants. “It feels like these rich countries have learned absolutely nothing in terms of support.” South Africa’s number of daily infections — 2,828 on Friday — was a small fraction of case counts in countries with similarly sized populations, like Germany and Britain, not to mention the US. Just over 10% of people in Africa have received one dose of a vaccine, compared with 64% in North America and 62% in Europe. Some health officials said that the travel bans may buy some time to figure out how to deal with the new variant. But just as border closures a year ago did little to stop the spread of an earlier coronavirus variant from Britain, scientists said, the latest travel shutdowns had likely come too late. Scientists worried that the restrictions would discourage other nations from reporting variant cases, lest they also get slapped with travel bans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/as-african-nations-banned-sa-says-its-punishment-for-honesty/articleshow/87956159.cms||---

The assembly on September 13 passed the bill to exempt Tamil Nadu from NEET. It seeks to give admissions to students to UG courses in medicine, dentistry, Indian medicine and homeopathy on the basis of marks obtained by them in the qualifying examination - the exam conducted by the state board of higher secondary examination for Class XII or any equivalent examination conducted by the CBSE or the board of any other state or any other authority. The bill also provides for 7.5% internal reservation for the students of government schools in medical courses. "Considering the impact (of NEET) on Tamil Nadu in medical admission, the CM urged the governor to immediately send the bill passed by the assembly for Presidential assent," an official release said. Water resources minister S Duraimurugan, health minister Ma Subramanian, health secretary J Radhakrishnan and a few other senior officials accompanied Stalin to the Raj Bhavan. The DMK government set up a committee to study whether NEET-based admission had adversely affected the social, economic and federal polity and how it impacted students. The committee, in its report concluded that the state should undertake immediate steps to eliminate NEET. "Based on the recommendations of the committee, the assembly passed the bill, and sent it to the governor to get Presidential assent," the release said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-cm-mk-stalin-urges-governor-to-send-neet-bill-to-president-for-assent/articleshow/87956235.cms||---

The foundation stone for the work had been unveiled by former chief minister Manohar Parrikar in June 2013. But though the road had been widened, the work could not be completed due to various problems related to land acquisition, etc. “At a few spots, there were some problems but they've been sorted out,” Lobo said during a site inspection recently. “Once the road dividers are in place, the entire stretch will be made into a no-parking zone and traffic movement coming and exiting Calangute will become smoother.” The road stretch is being developed on the lines of the Chogm road stretch from Saligao circle towards Calangute and will have footpaths on the side with benches for people to sit.

---||Hyderabad||After Centre's push, Telangana govt tells farmers not to grow paddy||HYDERABAD: After the Centre made it clear that it would not procure parboiled rice in the forthcoming rabi season, the Telangana government has asked farmers not to cultivate paddy in the rabi season. The government has also decided not to allow paddy from other states to land at the procurement centres in the state and directed district collectors and superintendents of police to prevent vehicles carrying paddy from entering into the state. The government said it had taken this step to protect the interests of Telangana farmers. "Farmers who have tie-ups with seed companies and rice millers or for self-consumption can take up paddy cultivation at their own risk," chief secretary Somesh Kumar said on Saturday. He said the Food Corporation of India (FCI) will not procure parboiled rice from Telangana. The CS said this was decided during a video-conference FCI held with district collectors, agriculture and civil supplies departments officials. M Mahendar Reddy, DGP, was also present at the meeting. Sources said the state government took the decision after a delegation led by agriculture minister S Niranjan Reddy, ministers Errabelli Dayakar Rao, Ch Malla Reddy, and Somesh Kumar failed to extract any assurance from the Centre on enhancement of paddy procurement quota when it met Union food minister Piyush Goyal in Delhi on Friday. The Centre was also evasive on setting an annual target for procurement. Open new paddy procurement centres: CS tells collectors As the farmers were concerned over delay in procurement of paddy in the current kharif season, the CS directed the collectors to open new paddy procurement centres (PPCs), if required, and visit them regularly. Collectors have also been asked to speed up milling of paddy to rice to avoid space shortage for new procurement. Earlier in the day, FCI said the Centre would procure paddy from Telangana as per the MoU entered with the state government at the existing minimum support price (MSP) for the current kharif season. Denying that the Centre had totally stopped procurement, FCI officials said: "A factually wrong news is being spread around that the Centre has stopped paddy procurement in Telangana for the kharif season. The department of food and public distribution has clarified that paddy procurement in Telangana will continue as before at the existing MSP." The FCI had entered into an agreement with the state government to procure 40 lakh metric tonnes of paddy in this kharif season. It had also taken an undertaking from Telangana that the state will not insist on the FCI to buy boiled rice in the rabi season. During the meeting with Telangana ministers on Friday, Goyal is believed to have told them that the Centre cannot buy boiled rice as there was no market for it in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/after-centres-push-telangana-govt-tells-farmers-not-to-grow-paddy/articleshow/87956254.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||World||A cure for Type 1 diabetes? For one man, it seems to have worked||Brian Shelton’s life was ruled by Type 1 diabetes. When his blood sugar plummeted, he would lose consciousness without warning. He crashed his motorcycle into a wall. He passed out in a customer’s yard while delivering mail. Following that episode, his boss told him to retire, after a quarter century in the Postal Service. He was 57. Early this year, his ex-wife, Cindy Shelton, spotted a call for people with Type 1 diabetes to participate in a trial by Vertex Pharmaceuticals. The company was testing a treatment developed over decades by a scientist who vowed to find a cure after his kids got the disease. Shelton was the first patient. On June 29, he got an infusion of cells, grown from stem cells but just like the insulin-producing pancreas cells his body lacked. Now his body automatically controls its insulin and blood sugar levels. Shelton, now 64, may be the first person cured of the disease with a new treatment that has experts daring to hope that help may be coming for many of the 1.5 million Americans suffering from Type 1 diabetes. “It’s a whole new life,” Shelton said. Diabetes experts were astonished but urged caution. The study is continuing and will take five years, involving 17 people with Type 1 diabetes. It is not intended as a treatment for the more common Type 2 diabetes. “We’ve been looking for something like this to happen for decades,” said Dr Irl Hirsch, a diabetes expert at the University of Washington who was not involved in the study. He wants to see the result, not yet published in a peer-reviewed journal, replicated in more people. He also wants to know if there’ll be adverse effects and if the cells will last for a lifetime or if the treatment would have to be repeated. But, he said, “bottom line, it’s an amazing result”. It all started with the quest of a Harvard University biologist, Doug Melton. He had never thought about diabetes until 1991 when his 6-month-old son, Sam, got sick and was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. . Type 1 is lethal unless patients get injections of insulin. Patients are at risk of going blind. People with Type 1 diabetes are at risk of having their legs amputated and of death in the night because their blood sugar plummets during sleep. In time, his daughter Emma, four years older than Sam, also developed the disease, when she was 14. The only cure is a pancreas transplant or a transplant of the insulin-producing cell clusters of the pancreas, known as islet cells, from an organ donor’s pancreas. But a shortage of organs makes this approach an impossibility. Melton started studying diabetes, determined to find a cure. He turned to embryonic stem cells, which have the potential to become any cell in the body. His goal was to turn them into islet cells to treat patients. The challenge was to figure out what sequence of chemical messages would turn stem cells into insulin-secreting islet cells. The work involved figuring out how islets are made in the pancreas and conducting experiments to steer embryonic stem cells to becoming islets. After years when nothing worked, a small team of researchers achieved a breakthrough in 2014. They put a dye into the liquid where the stem cells were growing. The liquid would turn blue if the cells made insulin. After hours of waiting, one researcher saw a faint blue tinge that got darker and darker. The team was ecstatic. For the first time, they had made functioning pancreatic islet cells from embryonic stem cells.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/a-cure-for-type-1-diabetes-for-one-man-it-seems-to-have-worked/articleshow/87956264.cms||Gina Kolata
---||World||Uganda loses key airport to China lenders after loan default: Report||The Ugandan government has lost its major airport to China for failing to repay a loan, the African media reported. The government failed to reverse a loan agreement with the Chinese which had repayment conditions of attaching its airport, Today reported. President Yoweri Museveni had sent a delegation to Beijing hoping to renegotiate the toxic clauses. The visit was unsuccessful as China authorities refused to allow any alteration in the original terms of the deal. The Uganda government, represented by the finance ministry and the civil aviation authority, had on November 17, 2015, signed an agreement with Export-Import Bank of China (Exim Bank) to borrow $207 million at 2% upon disbursement; with a maturity period of 20 years including a seven-year grace period. The deal signed with the Chinese lenders virtually meant Uganda “surrendered” its key airport to China, the report said. The Uganda civil aviation authority said some provisions in the financing agreement expose Entebbe airport and other Ugandan assets to be attached and taken over by Chinese lenders upon arbitration in Beijing. According to the Daily Monitor of Uganda, the Ugandan government waived international immunity in the agreements it signed to secure the loans, exposing the airport to take over. Last week, Uganda’s finance minister Matia Kasaija apologised to parliament for the “mishandling of the $207 million loans” from China bank to expand the airport. However, China’s director-general for African affairs Wu Peng, according to a media report, has dismissed as “illogical propaganda” that they are confiscating facilities from African states because of indebtedness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/uganda-loses-key-airport-to-china-lenders-after-loan-default-report/articleshow/87956295.cms||---

There was an issue over the anthem not being played at the recently held convocation. "It is disheartening to learn that in the recently concluded convocation, the state invocation song was not sung, a deviation from a well-established protocol. I would like to point out that the invocation song is sung at all the state and Union government functions in Tamil Nadu including the functions where higher dignitaries like the President of India and the Prime Minister participate," the minister said in his letter dated November 24. IIT-Madras held its 58th convocation in virtual mode on November 20. "As you are aware, IIT-Madras was established in 1959 on an extent of 250 hectares of land provided by the Tamil Nadu government. From that time onwards, the state government has been contributing through various means for the growth and development of the institution, and the present government is also very keen on continuing the same support," Ponmudy wrote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/play-tamil-thai-vazhthu-at-all-events-tamil-nadu-govt-tells-iit-madras/articleshow/87956294.cms||---
---||World||Playing with lives: Channel migrant smugglers net millions per kilometre||CALAIS (FRANCE): The price to cross the English Channel varies according to the network of smugglers, between 3,000 and 7,000 euros. Often, the fee also includes a very short-term tent rental in the windy dunes of northern France and food cooked over fires that sputter in the rain that falls for more than half the month of November in the Calais region. Sometimes, but not always, it includes a life vest and fuel for the outboard motor. And the people who collect the money — up to 300,000 euros ($432,000) per boat that makes it across the narrows of the Channel — are not the ones arrested in the periodic raids along the coastline. They are just what French police call “the little hands”. Now, French authorities are hoping to move up the chain of command. The French judicial investigation into Wednesday’s sinking that killed 27 people has been turned over to Paris-based prosecutors who specialise in organised crime. To cross the 33-kilometre narrow point of the Channel, the rubber dinghies must navigate frigid waters and passing cargo ships. As of November 17, about 23,000 people had crossed successfully, according to Britain’s home office. France intercepted about 19,000 people. At a minimum, then, smuggling organisations this year have netted 69 million euros for the crossing — that’s 2 million euros per kilometre. “This has become so profitable for criminals that it’s going to take a phenomenal amount of effort to shift it,” the UK home office’s Dan O’Mahoney told parliament on November 17. Between coronavirus and Brexit, “this is a golden age for the smugglers and organised crime because the countries are in disarray,” said Mimi Vu, an expert on Vietnamese migration who regularly spends time in the camps of northern France. “Think of it like a shipping and logistics company,” Vu said. The men handling the last leg are essentially just making the final delivery. If they are arrested, they are replaceable, she said. The chain starts in the home country, usually with an agreed-upon price, arranged over social media. That fee tends to shift over the journey, but most willingly pay extra as their destination grows closer, she said. That’s precisely when the logistics grow more complicated. Channel crossings by sea were relatively rare until a few years ago, when French and British authorities locked down the area around the Eurotunnel entrance. The deaths of 39 Vietnamese migrants in the back of a container truck may also have contributed to a new reluctance to use that route.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/playing-with-lives-channel-migrant-smugglers-net-millions-per-kilometre/articleshow/87956325.cms||---

The Meteorological department has forecast widespread showers, particularly in coastal regions till November 29. More than 11,000 people have been moved to 123 shelters across TN. National Disaster Response Force units have been deployed in Chengelpet and Kancheepuram districts. For the second day in a row, most parts of Chennai and its suburbs were inundated. Overflowing water channels cut off GST Road and Tambaram-Sriperumbudur road making them unmotorable for most part of the day. Chief minister M K Stalin inspected several flooded roads in T Nagar at 7.30pm and urged officials to take steps to drain out water expeditiously. More than 8,500 cusecs of water was released from city reservoirs, including Poondi. About 23,600 cusecs was let out from Mettur dam in Salem district. Red alert to stay as Chennai records wettest NovemberAfter heavy spells of rain sent several streets under water again, the city on Saturday reached a grim milestone of recording one of the wettest Novembers as Chennai Nungambakkam weather station crossed 1,000mm only for the third time in at least the last 100 years. The observatory, which recorded rainfall on 24 of the 27 days this month, registered 1,006mm of rain as of Saturday 8.30pm. While a red alert is in place for Sunday, with heavy to very heavy rainfall forecast for the city and the suburbs as well for north coastal districts, weathermen said a relief may be in sight from Monday when rain is likely to reduce, possibly leading to a dry spell. Meteorologists said the city observatory recorded the highest rainfall for November in 1918 with 1088mm, followed by 1049mm in 2015. As of Saturday morning, Chennai Nungambakkam recorded 197cm annual rainfall against a normal 140cm. It includes 1199mm since October 1, an excess of 529.9mm for the season. Meenambakkam registered 185cm annual rainfall against 138cm including 1053.1mm since October 1, an excess of 447mm rainfall. The two stations recorded 22.9mm and 19.4mm till 8.30pm as rain intensity reduced on Saturday. However, rains picked up pace later in the evening. For the next 48 hours, IMD has forecast thunderstorms with heavy to very heavy rainfall in Chennai and suburbs. Officials said the heavy rains are due to the cyclonic circulation over the Comorin area and adjoining Sri Lanka. "After Sunday, we can expect a gradual decrease in rainfall and there may be a few days of dry spell," said N Puviarasan, director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre, IMD, Chennai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/100cm-rain-in-chennai-third-time-in-100-years/articleshow/87956326.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Railway police rule out foul play in death of singer Harini Rao's dad||HYDERABAD: Railway police have ruled out foul play in the death of AK Rao, father of singer Harini Rao, in Bengaluru a few days ago . Also, forensic experts reportedly concluded that the injures on his body were self-inflicted. Rao's body was found on the railway tracks between Yelahanka and Rajanukunte stations on the outskirts of Bengaluru on November 23. Government Railway Police (GRP), Bengaluru, said that Rao had sustained self-inflicted injuries before he suffered a fatal blow to his head due to a train hit. "There is no foul play in the death of AK Rao," GRP, Bengaluru, deputy superintendent of police D Ashok told STOI over the phone. The singer's family had earlier raised doubts over his death. When asked about the presence of a knife, blade, a pair scissors at the incident spot, the GRP officer said that after forensic experts visited the spot, prima facie, it was concluded that Rao suffered self-inflicted injuries. "But his death took place after his head was hit by the cow catcher of a train. The investigation is still being done to come to a final conclusion on aspects like what could have led to the suicide," Ashok added. Rao's other daughter Shalini had lodged a complaint with the police, suspecting that her father might have been murdered elsewhere before his body was dumped on the railway tracks. Police said that they have clues from where Rao had got the knife and other tools. Rao's daughter last spoke to him on Nov 19  On November 23, after a body was found on the trackss, railway authorities informed GRP, which established it was the body of Rao, a Hyderabad-based project consultant. On November 22, he appeared before the Suddaguntepalya police in Bengaluru in connection with a cheating case in which he had been summoned for questioning. The case was related to arranging finance for two businessmen. Rao's family resides in Srinagar Colony in the city. When TOI tried to reach out to Shalini, she was unavailable. Rao is said to have stayed at the residence of his daughter till November 13, but later moved into a hotel. His daughter had last spoken to him over the phone on November 19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/railway-police-rule-out-foul-play-in-death-of-singer-harini-raos-dad/articleshow/87956383.cms||---

He also said Congress has prepared an action plan to stop BJP from looting the youth and depriving merit-based selection. Congress has alleged that BJP accumulated crores of rupees by selling jobs of PSIs and constables and further, threatened to go to court with the evidence. He said that an amount of Rs 30-35 lakh is being demanded for the post of PSI, while the post of constable is being sold for Rs 15 lakh. “The future of the youth has been sold for lakhs of rupees by selling jobs in the open market. Exams are compromised and the whole process is manipulated by BJP. Despite public outcry over the issue, chief minister Pramod Sawant is mum,” Chodankar said. Recalling the incident where MLA Isidore Fernandes’ son had produced fake certificates for the Avval Karkoon post, which was later scrapped, he also said that deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavlekar had openly accepted that other MLAs, except him, had taken money for jobs. Fisheries minister Filipe Neri Rodrigues’s PA and Sawant’s supporters are getting 100 out of 100 marks for job exams, Chodankar alleged. He said 32 employees in the electricity department, in the post of assistant data operators, were sacked after a court direction that found irregularities. However, no action was taken on the officers and those conducting exams for these posts, he said. Candidates who pay for jobs, are told to either leave the answer sheet blank or take it to home to answer later,” Chodankar alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/scrap-recruitment-process-start-afresh-under-courts-eye/articleshow/87954964.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Behrampore ex-chairman arrested for ‘lewd remarks’, granted bail||Behrampore: Former Behrampore Municipality chairman Nil Ratan Adhya was arrested from his Khagra residence on Saturday morning after a civic employee lodged a police complaint, accusing him of passing lewd remarks and threatening to kill her. He was granted bail later in the day. The municipality employee, who filed a written complaint, also provided an audio clip as “evidence”. She claimed the former chairman, on an earlier occasion, had even “abused” chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Adhya’s arrest became the talk of the town because of his long political career in the Congress, and then in Trinamool Congress. He had served as a councillor for 39 years and was the chairman of the Congress-run municipality board four times since 2000 before he switched to Trinamool in 2016. The former chairman had run into controversies earlier too. A woman had lodged a complaint in 2020, saying he had made an “indecent proposal” when she went to him seeking a job. In another instance, the urban development and municipal affairs department had set up an inquiry over the alleged “misappropriation of funds” against firms run by his only daughter and son-in-law. Denying all the allegations, the Adhya said: “Some people now in Trinamool conspired against me.” The party’s Murshidabad district president Shaoni Singharoy said: “I condemn the insulting of women when our government works for women empowerment. Police are investigating the matter. It is an attempt to defame our party. But, obviously, the party will help the woman and uphold her honour and prestige.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/behrampore-ex-chairman-arrested-for-lewd-remarks-granted-bail/articleshow/87955096.cms||Sukumar Mahato

He had come to see an oxygen plant at Midnapore Medical College and Hospital funded by PM Cares, and wondered why he was not invited to its inauguration. “The oxygen manufacturing plant at Midnapore Medical College has been set up. But they did not invite me for some unknown reason,” Ghosh said. College principal Panchanan Kundu held that the inauguration of the plant was awaited. “We are conducting a trial at present. No formal inauguration has been done,” Kundu said. Ghosh, however, said that the plant had already been inaugurated. He cited this as an instance of Trinamool’s “partisan attitude” and said TMC was afraid of holding municipal polls. “Trinamool is afraid of losing the polls. They know that it won’t be possible for them to rig votes if municipal polls are held at one go across the state,” Ghosh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dilip-fumes-over-midnapore-oxy-plant-invite/articleshow/87955046.cms||Sujoy Khanra
---||Kolkata||Power ply||Kolkata: After a year of economic slump, the plywood industry is rising like a phoenix from the ashes — stronger, smarter and more powerful. The gradual easing of Covid restrictions and a fast-paced vaccination drive are helping businesses buffer the effects of the pandemic on the supply chain and resume normal production. The second wave may have disrupted the momentum in the first quarter of the current fiscal, but the industry is finally following a steady growth path, courtesy high real estate sales. Manoj Tulsian, CEO & joint MD of Greenply Industries, listed the macro-economic factors behind the significant turnaround. “The pandemic-induced home ownership sentiment, the work-from-home culture, a rapid growth in the IT sector and the record-low home loan rates have come together to boost the residential realty sector. Mortgage rates also continue to trend at their lowest in 15 years, leading to reduced EMIs and better affordability. All these positive macro-economic factors are acting like catalysts in the performance of the plywood industry in general,” he said. Manoj TulsianFor Greenply, the net sale was up 96.7% in the first quarter of FY22. The national player raked in Rs 260.1 crore in Q1 of FY22 compared to Rs 132.2 crore in Q1 of FY21. In the second quarter of FY22, the business growth was 46.2%, with the net sale at Rs 430.8 crore against Rs 294.6 crore in Q2 of FY21. In the fourth quarter of FY21, the company had recorded sales worth Rs 396 crore. “We are optimistic that the numbers will be better in Q4 of FY22, as the country has crossed the 100-crore vaccination milestone while logistics and transportation issues are gradually getting resolved,” Tulsian said. He added that the waterproof/marine grade plywood with ‘Virashield’ protection, which met zero-emission norms, had recorded the highest sales since the pandemic hit because consumer preference saw a paradigm shift towards home interiors that took care of their health too. The market size of the plywood industry is approximately Rs 22,500 crore, in which the unorganised sector has a share of 75%. In stark contrast to the organised sector, the margin has been minimal for the unorganised sector owing to consumer affinity for durable and branded products. An increase in the cost of raw materials further worsened the situation. According to Akhilesh Chitlangia, the president and third-generation promoter of Duroply Industries, the current upward trajectory in the plywood industry is expected to continue for the next four-five years because of the pandemic-induced housing market boom and the government’s push for growth of infrastructure in the country. Akhilesh ChitlangiaFor DURO (the brand name for the company’s range of plywood), sales in Q1 and Q2 of FY22 were approximately 70% higher as compared to the corresponding period in FY21. The demand in Q3 of FY22 has been 30% higher against Q3 of FY21. “We expect Q4 to be better; by around 20% over last year,” Chitlangia said, adding that the premium plywood category was recording the highest sales since Covid because consumers were no longer willing to compromise on the quality of materials for their homes. Duroply Industries has launched a bunch of new products, including fire-resistant plywood and a 10ft variety, following a survey. Director of Kitply Industries Sandip Sawalka believes the plywood sector hit the recovery road in July 2021. However, having faced zero-revenue months and constant pressure to meet fixed/overhead expenses, he concedes that the biggest challenge for the industry is to maintain regular cash flow. “To meet monthly expenses such as salaries, rent, etc., we are trying to work with associates/channel partners whose payments are faster,” Sawalka said. Kitply is the only lumber company in India to have forestry of its own, developed on a wasteland. It has been awarded the highest corporate honour — the Indira Gandhi Vrikshamitra Puraskar — by the Indian government in recognition of its pioneering role in wasteland development and contribution to forest conservation. Nikita BansalIn Q2 of FY22, Century Plyboards India (CPIL) saw the highest-ever volume and revenue in the company’s history. While plywood revenue in Q1 of FY22 grew 126% year-on-year (YoY), revenue in Q2 was up 66% YoY. “The true barometer is that Q2 of FY22 is already at 10% growth compared to Q4 of FY21, which recorded a plywood revenue to the tune of Rs 399 crore,” said Nikita Bansal, CPIL’s executive director. “Despite the high base, we expect it to grow in double digits in Q4 of FY22,” she added. According to Bansal, the company’s fast recovery can be attributed to its innovations in the plywood segment since the pandemic started. “We have embedded three new technologies into our plywood products to drive strong volume growth in times to come. These are ‘Virokill’, a nanotechnology-driven feature to kill surface viruses; ‘Firewall’ to provide a three-ring protection from fire in compliance with Indian, British and American standards; and ‘Century Promise’, an app that allows customers to scan QR codes and verify a product’s authenticity,” she said. For CPIL, two of its major products — Club Prime and Sainik 710 — have contributed to more than 60% of the company’s overall sales since the Covid outbreak. While Club Prime is waterproof plywood that comes with 25 years of warranty against termites, Sainik 710 is an in-house manufactured waterproof plywood that offers eight years of warranty and is priced at the range of unbranded plywood to shift consumer preference.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/power-ply/articleshow/87955005.cms||---

Once the airport becomes operational, it will be the fourth airport in the state after Kolkata, Bagdogra and Andal. “The airport infrastructure — runway, terminal building and other facilities — is ready. There are some issues with obstacles on the flight path. These are primarily trees. We have identified them and the forest department has been intimated. They will be removed soon,” Ghatak said. The DGCA had identified the trees as obstacles and asked the state authorities to get them removed last March. However, the momentum derailed thereafter owing to the outbreak of the pandemic. With cases now down and life returning to normal, efforts are underway to operationalise the airport. Under the regional connectivity scheme Udan, a flight had also been proposed by a private carrier from Burnpur to Guwahati via Bagdogra. Apart from Ghatak, those who attended the meeting at the DM’s chamber included representatives from the Asansol-Durgapur Development Authority, Asansol Municipal Corporation, Asansol-Durgapur police commissionerate and SAIL.

A fourth worker miraculously escaped with minor injuries. Tanmoy Ghosh (shift in-charge), Shibsankar Bhattacharjee (operator), Dilip Gope and Shiunath Ram were on night duty at Shyam Sel Ltd when the concrete storage structure came crashing. While Ram had a close shave, his colleagues were trapped in the debris, prompting a marathon search. After 21 hours, three bodies were found. Trinamool Congress’s Raniganj MLA Tapas Banerjee, who had visited the accident site earlier in the day, accused the management of Shyam Sel of inadequate infrastructure and negligence. BJP leader Jitendra Tewari, on the other hand, rushed an email to the district magistrate, demanding that a complaint be lodged against the factory’s owners and necessary action taken. In a typical fly ash handling system, the residual matter generated as the result of a combustion is captured by an electrostatic precipitator (ESP), or a baghouse, before the flue gases reach the stack. The storage silos generally have provision for a truck to carry out the fly ash for disposal or reuse. Sumit Chakraborty, assistant vice-president (HR) of Shyam Sel, told TOI they always followed safety protocol. “We don’t know how this happened. Those present at the site were contractual workers,” Chakraborty said. DM Bibhu Goyel said they would investigate what exactly happened, how and why.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/3-workers-buried-alive-as-silo-collapses-at-burdwan-factory/articleshow/87955525.cms||Mohammad Asif
---||Lucknow||UP: On December 2, Amit Shah to lay foundation of new varsity in Saharanpur||LUCKNOW: Union home minister and former BJP chief Amit Shah will be in Saharanpur, a district dominated by Muslims and Dalits, on December 2, for the first time after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced repeal of three contentious farm laws. Though the farmers are continuing their protest with various other demands including MSP guarantee, Shah's visit is being seen by many as BJP's bid to woo farmers in UP, who are mostly from Jat community from West UP region, and Dalits. During his visit, Shah will lay the foundation stone for Maa Shakumbhari Devi University in Behat assembly constituency. A senior BJP leader told TOI that though the date is almost confirmed, the final decision would be taken on Sunday. ‘Shah’s visit seen as BJP bid to mobilise its cadre’Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who had announced the naming of the university after Ma Shakumbari Devi, would also be present with Amit Shah, the senior BJP leader confirmed. Of the seven assembly seats falling in Saharanpur district, four are with BJP, two with Congress and one with the Samajwadi Party. However, of the total 80 seats in west UP region, 60 are with the BJP. The saffron party faces the challenge to at least maintain the status quo. Nakur and Gangoh seats fall under Kairana Lok Sabha constituency while the remaining five fall in Saharanpur Lok Sabha constituency. BJP’s Raghav Lakhan Pal was defeated by BSP’s Fazlur Rehman in 2019 Lok Sabha election from Saharanpur constituency while BJP’s Pradeep Chaudhary won from Kairana Lok Sabha seat. However, since 2017, when the BJP performed exceptionally well in the West UP region in particular, the challenges and stakes before the BJP have increased. Some major challenges include winning back the Saharanpur City seat from SP. The seat was won by Rajeev Gumber of BJP in 2012 but SP’s Sanjay Garg managed to win the seat in 2017. The district is the stronghold of Congress leader Imran Masood. The BJP has a challenge to make a dent in Masood’s clout in the district along with wooing Dalit vote bank from BSP. Azad Samaj Party’s Chandrashekhar also has a stronghold in the district as it belongs to Saharanpur. His strength would be tested in the coming assembly elections as he failed to leave any impact in the previous Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections. Naresh Saini of Congress had won from Behat vidhan sabha constituency in 2017 assembly polls. The district has around 40% dominance of the minority community while Dalits, mainly Jatavs, who have remained loyal to Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party are second in terms of population. Shah’s visit to Saharanpur is being seen as the party’s bid to mobilise the party cadre in the run up to Vidhan Sabha elections. Former MP from Saharanpur Raghav Lakhan Pal told TOI that the demand for setting up a university was long pending and would cater to the needs of the youths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-on-december-2-amit-shah-to-lay-foundation-of-new-varsity-in-saharanpur/articleshow/87956485.cms||Rajeev Srivastava

The young male zebra was one among the three new ones transported from Israel on Thursday in run-up to the Lucknow Zoo's centenary year celebration. The incident happened around 10.30am, when the three new zebras, after getting excited due to reasons unknown, made a sudden movement and started running inside the enclosure. "It is very likely that due to the sudden movement, the zebras ran into an object or fence inside the enclosure due to which one of them sustained serious injuries and collapsed. After post-mortem, the cause of death came out to be cardio respiratory failure due to traumatic shock," said zoo veterinary doctor Brijendra Yadav. ‘Will ensure limited human interaction’This has been an unfortunate incident for all of us here since the entire zoo was excited to have the zebras. Sudden outburst of excitement and running is pretty common in zebras. Therefore, they are very prone to getting injured or going into shock or having heart attack. A lot of care has to be administered from the time they travel from one end to another. Change of habitat is also a common factor. For the other two inmates, we are administering strict care to avoid any such future incident,” said zoo director RK Singh. The zoo had two zebra enclosures. The remaining two zebras have been shifted to the other enclosure and are currently doing fine. “We will ensure that there’s minimum disturbance and limited human interaction with the two till the time they completely adapt to the environment,” Yadav. The zebras were transported from Israel via New Delhi, wherein they were given a mixture of gram, bran and grass and water thrice. Before public viewing, the zoo had kept the three inmates in quarantine for 15 days after which they would be ready for visitors. After six years, the zebra enclosure was vibrant with the inmates. The enclosure was lying vacant since the death of last zebra Bankit in 2015.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/1-year-old-zebra-brought-to-lucknow-zoo-from-israel-dies/articleshow/87956503.cms||Aditi Singh

This plant will come up in addition to another such waste-to-energy facility being set up in Galand. At a GMC board meeting on Saturday, it was also decided that the rent of shops leased out by the civic body would be on a par with the prevalent circle rate of that particular area. The move has led to objections from the trader community, who pointed out that their effective rent would go up by almost 11 times if the decision was implemented. “The scientific disposal of solid waste has emerged as a major challenge for the GMC. We have taken steps to deal with it. Among them is the initiative to set up a waste-to-energy plant in Galand. A proposal to construct another such plant on GMC land in Dundahera was vetted by the board,” said Mahendra Singh Tanwar, the municipal commissioner. “The waste processing unit and the landfill will come up on 15 acres. We must clarify that the plant is not going to be like the traditional landfill in Pratap Vihar,” he added. Tanwar explained that most of the 1,200 tonnes of civic waste that Ghaziabad generates daily will be processed at the Galand waste-to-energy plant. “However, the waste that cannot be processed there, say about 10%, will find its way to the plant in Dundahera,” he said. At the meeting, officials also pitched for hiking the rent of 1,702 shops owned by the GMC in the city. Rent from commercial establishments is a major source of revenue for the civic body. “It was felt that the rent GMC is commanding now is too low. For some time, we had been working on a plan to hike the rent and make it on a par with the circle rate. The proposal was placed at the board meeting and was approved,” Tanwar said. Traders in the city objected to the decision to hike the rent. “If our rents are on a par with the circle rate, they will go up by almost 11 times. We are anyway trying to come to terms with losses incurred during the pandemic. This hike is unjustified. We protested outside the GMC office and we will continue to oppose it,” said Sohan Lal, a protesting trader. The municipal commissioner, however, clarified that the hike would not be implemented immediately. “We will first seek objections from people before going ahead with the plan,” he added. For the current financial year, the GMC board said it hoped to earn a revenue of Rs 1,262 crore and proposed an expenditure of Rs 1,100 crore. Another proposal placed at the meeting was to maintain a register for roads. “Roads developed by GMC are usually ill-maintained. So, a proposal was passed to maintain a register to monitor the roads. This will ensure a proper audit. If a road gets damaged in a short span of time, it will be noted down in the register and the contractor concerned will be held accountable,” said Rajendra Tyagi, a BJP councillor. There is also a plan to replace 500 diesel vehicles with CNG ones. It was also decided that GMC would issue a work order of Rs 1 crore in every ward in a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/plan-to-set-up-waste-plant-in-dundahera-gets-gmc-boards-nod/articleshow/87955180.cms||Abhijay Jha

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Saturday 2nd most polluted day of November||LUCKNOW: The city witnessed a spike in pollution levels by around 150 units in the last five days, with the air quality deteriorating from poor to 'very poor' on Saturday. According to the data released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the city's Air Quality Index was 317. As compared to Friday, the air pollution level registered an increase of over 32 units in just 24 hours making the weekend, the second most air polluted day of the month. Track the pollution level in your cityA high concentration of nano pollutants of PM2.5 and PM10 was registered in all main localities of the city, including Hazratganj, Lalbagh, Indiranagar, Nishatganj, Kukrail, Gomtinagar and Talkatora, where the average concentration in morning and evening hours crossed an alarming 350-mark. Environmentalists said the spike in air pollution level is majorly due to a drop in temperatures, an increase in vehicular load due to rush in markets following the wedding season and low wind speed. According to CPCB live air quality monitoring station, PM 2.5 concentrations were found to be around six times higher than the permissible limit of 60 and PM 10 concentrations were found to be around four times higher than the permissible limits set by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The last time the air pollution levels of the city crossed the 300-mark was on November 8, when air pollution level was 338 and on November 1 when AQI was 308. "Entire November has been in the grip of poor air quality. The situation is expected to worsen in December and January due to further drop in temperatures. A plan of action needs to be prepared and implemented with immediate effect to control this rapid rise in air pollution levels, else the air quality of the city will turn 'severe' in the next few days," said environmentalist Prof Venkatesh Dutta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lucknow-saturday-2nd-most-polluted-day-of-november/articleshow/87956543.cms||---

Jammu-based defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand said, "A rally was organised for veteran soldiers of Jammu & Kashmir Rifles hailing from the region at Mamun Military Station, Pathankot. Lt Gen Joshi presided over the event, in which over 300 veterans, including war heroes belonging to Jammu & Kashmir Rifles took part. Most of these war heroes had served under the leadership of Lt Gen Joshi, who was the commanding officer of 13th Battalion of J&K Rifles during the Kargil War." During the Kargil War, under his leadership, the battalion had launched four attacks, with the most successful being on Point 4875 (now called Batra Top after Captain Vikram Batra, who made the supreme sacrifice and was awarded the Param Vir Chakra). Lt Col Anand added that the battalion was also conferred with the honour of the 'Bravest of The Brave' and was awarded many gallantry awards during the Kargil War. Col Anand said the Northern Army Commander interacted with all the veterans and commended their continued contribution to the nation building process. "He also applauded the grit with which they overcame every obstacle to keep the Indian flag flying high," Col Anand added. An awareness workshop on new policies and various schemes available to the Indian Army veterans was also organised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/northern-command-chief-meets-army-veterans-war-heroes/articleshow/87956544.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

The exhibition was inaugurated on the sidelines of COP26 in Glasgow and has been travelling around different cities in the UK. The Indian government has provided $4 billion towards the rejuvenation of the Ganga but estimates are that $100 billion will be required over 15 years. So far 347 projects have been commissioned, which will be completed in 2022 or 2023. ”In 2014 the government of India took up the challenge of cleaning and rejuvenating the 2,500km river, upon which 50 crore people are dependant. We have learnt some major lessons from the river Thames and other rivers with regards to cleaning methods and we want to connect with the international community and the diaspora to seek their help and expertise to take this project forward,” Rozy Agarwal, executive director, finance, of National Mission for Clean Ganga, said. Forthcoming initiatives include converting all the biodegradable waste from the river into biogas. India has the potential to generate 310 to 655 billion cubic metres of biogas a year by 2040, which is 36% of India’s current energy supply. There are also plans to convert municipal solid waste, sewage gas, and sludge from waste-water treatment plants across the Gangetic belt into hydrogen. One tonne of solid waste has the capacity to generate 100 kilos of hydrogen. This will help India reach its net zero target by 2070. Industrial and household waste can be traded on waste trading platforms. For example, waste-water can be traded for industrial use and dried and dis-infected biosolids from sewage could be reused by farmers as manure. As a result of the roadshow, four chapters have now been formed in Scotland, Wales, Midlands, and London to connect various interest groups with the Namami Gange programme. A Scotland-India water partnership has been announced to facilitate Scottish entities specializing in water entering the Indian market. Scientists and academics from a string of British universities agreed to create a knowledge pool for exchange of ideas and projects with UK universities to improve the livelihoods of people living around the Ganga. The Indian government is inviting investors globally to build and run sewage treatment plants, as untreated sewage is one of the holy river's main pollutants. A total of 250 sewage plants must be built across the Ganga and its tributaries. So far there are 158. One British company, one of 14 British innovations in the Namami Gange programme, has come forward to offer a floating water treatment system. These companies have also received investment commitment from investors to scale up their solutions around the world. Roundtables were held with finance leaders which led to the establishment of a Ganga finance and investments forum, which will develop state of the art financial instruments such as high impact blue bonds as well as channel investments from around the world into the programme. A Global Youth for Ganga encouraging youth from India and other countries to exchange ideas was set up, as was a UK based charity that resident diaspora and other individuals can donate to. “Communities are the most important assets for our battle against climate change and environmental issues,” Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Union minister of Jal Shakti, said. Dr Vinod Tare, founding head of cGanga, a think-tank set up by the ministry of Jal Shakti, said: “There are problems globally about river pollution. It is not unique to India. We can share our experiences and knowledge with each other and to that effect the programme will twin Indian rivers with British rivers in the coming year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/clean-ganga-roadshow-gets-enthusiastic-response-from-investors-universities-in-britain/articleshow/87956568.cms||NAOMI CANTON

The raid was carried out early by officials from the Custodian of Enemy Property for India (CEPI), which functions under the MHA, and led by assistant custodian (Delhi and Kolkata region) Abhishek Agarwal. According to ministry sources, the property was notified as ‘enemy property’ after its owners Azizur Rahman, Nazidur Rahman and Noor Jahan Begum moved to Pakistan during or after the Indo-Pak wars between 1965 and 1971. Bengal is said to have the highest number of ‘enemy property’ after Uttar Pradesh. Kolkata houses 96 such properties, many of them situated in prime locations such as BBD Bag. Realtors have been eyeing them for a long time and several such premises have been illegally occupied. The Centre has identified over 3,000 new ‘enemy property’ left behind by Chinese and Pakistani nationals after the India-China war in 1962 and Indo-Pak wars in 1965 and 1971. The number of ‘enemy property’ vested with the CEPI has risen to 12,426 from 9,406, according to government officials. Such properties in Kolkata include shoe shops, restaurants, orchards and iconic buildings at prime addresses. CEPI has 2,786 properties spread over 13 districts in Bengal. Of these, 2,735 are immovable assets of those who left these behind and took citizenship of Pakistan after Partition or after the 1965 and 1971 wars with India. The remaining 51 constitute immovable properties of those who took Chinese citizenship in the aftermath of the 1962 war.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mha-team-raids-seals-enemy-property-in-central-kolkata/articleshow/87955319.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The toll in the heart-wrenching incident rose to three during the day, with 19-year-old engineering student Grishma dying on Saturday. Her parents — Sanjeev and Archana Joshi — are still in critical condition. Grishma’s younger sister, Purvi, 16, and grandmother Nandini, 67, had died on Friday. “Yesterday’s incident, in which an entire family tried to commit suicide due to arbitrary interest being charged by usurers and moneylenders, is heartbreaking and unbearable. Three members of the family have died,” the CM said at an emergency meeting to control illegal money lending on Saturday. He ordered strict action against those involved in the incident. Four women ‘loan sharks’ have been arrested. Only licenced moneylenders can continue biz, says CMThe CM directed officials to take strict action against those indulging in usury. He discussed provisions of Moneylenders Act and Scheduled Caste Loans Regulations with chief secretary Iqbal Singh Bains, ACS-home Rajesh Rajora, DGP Vivek Johri and other officers at the meeting. “Some people give loans without licence at arbitrary rates of interest and harass people for recovery. Many times, more money is charged than the money lent. There is a need to run a campaign to curb such activities,” Chouhan said, adding that licenced moneylenders, who operate according to government rules, can run their business. But extorting money through loans and forcing people to commit suicide cannot be tolerated, said the CM, “All departments should ensure coordinated and concrete action in this regard. Information on unregistered people, who are conducting these activities, should be collected,” Chouhan said.

---||Bhopal||International trade nod may delay cheetah translocation in Madhya Pradesh further||BHOPAL: The execution of world’s first intercontinental ‘South Africa-Madhya Pradesh Cheetah translocation project’ may take longer than expected as approval of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is needed. Eight cheetahs, half of them males, are to be shifted from South Africa to MP’s Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary in the first phase of the project. Sources say this project cannot take off without consent of the agency. CITES is a treaty between governments to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten the survival of the species. It was drafted following a resolution at a meeting of members of the International Union for Conservation of Nature in 1963, which entered into force on 1 July 1975. “Yes, their approval is necessary for this project. But I am not aware if the central ministry has taken it from them. It is the MoEF’s responsibility,” said an IFS officer. Cheetah has been in CITES Appendix-I list since its inception. “Globally, this species is considered ‘vulnerable’ on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, with a declining extant population of less than 7,000, found primarily in the savannas of Africa. While southern Africa is the cheetah’s regional stronghold, it is considered critically endangered in North and West Africa. A small and remnant Asiatic population exists also in Iran, where it is assessed as critically endangered,” says a report on CITES. Cheetahs face a variety of pressures to their existence in the wild, including habitat loss, hunting of their prey base for bush-meat, illegal international trade and conflict with livestock owners, it added. Cheetahs last spotted in India during 1950sSince the trade in wild animals and plants crosses borders between countries, the effort to regulate it requires international cooperation to safeguard certain species from over-exploitation, they say. In 2019, the SC had given its nod to the National Tiger Conservation Authority’s proposal to experimentally introduce African cheetahs in Indian jungles. The last of the cheetahs in the country was hunted down in the 1950s. After an extensive study, Kuno was selected as the ideal location for shifting Cheetahs. The Cheetah Conservation Fund, Namibia, had expressed its willingness to donate cheetahs to India. According to NTCA, reintroduction of cheetah would be a matter of great conservation significance, as it would be the only large animal that peninsular India has lost in its historical times and bringing focus on country’s most productive yet neglected grassland ecosystem. Weather conditions back home along with Covid-19 and violence in South Africa has already delayed this project to a large extent.

A dozen new cases were detected in Indore on Saturday, taking MP’s daily count to 23. It’s the highest day’s tally in weeks. As many as 110 new cases have been detected in the last seven days — that too when testing is far lower than what’s ordered by CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan. There were barely 58,000 tests on Saturday while the CM has mandated a minimum of 70,000. Indore is again leading the spurt in cases — 45 in a week. “Five of the 12 new cases are from one family, residing in Milan Heights near Pipliyahana. They said some guests from Maharashtra recently arrived for a wedding at their house,” district Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Amit Malakar said, adding that three others are from another family. One patient is a staff member of Military Hospital, Mhow. Bhopal, with seven cases, and Raisen, with three, were the other big contributors to Saturday’s Covid count. Four fatalities in 10 days in MP, most fully vaccinatedSo far, 15 Army officers, most of whom were pursuing a course at IIM-Indore, and a staff member of MH Mhow have tested positive for Covid-19. They are admitted to the Mhow hospital,” Malakar said, adding that all the remaining patients have been admitted to a Covidcare centre as a precautionary measure. “They are fully vaccinated and asymptomatic” he said. Four deaths were reported in MP between November 16 and 25. At least three of them were fully vaccinated. The health department is carrying out intensive contact tracing of all those recently tested positive, said Dr Malakar. Indore, which has so far reported over 1.53 lakh Covid cases and 1,393 deaths, has 38 active cases. In the last -week, Indore’s Covid count has fluctuated — 6 on November 20, followed by 4 new cases and a death on November 21, 3 cases on November 22 and 13 cases on November 23. After a dip over the next two days (5 and 2), the daily count shot up to 12 late Friday night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/12-new-covid-cases-in-indore-110-in-madhya-pradesh-in-seven-days/articleshow/87956549.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Leopard mauls 2 forest rangers in Chhatarpur||BHOPAL: Two forest rangers were injured, one of them seriously, when a leopard attacked them in Lugasi village of Chhatarpur on Saturday. The village is in lockdown mode as the leopard is still lurking there. Deputy rangers R K Saxena and Santosh Kondar have been hospitalised with multiple injuries. Saxena has suffered serious head wounds. Residents of Lugasi village in Naugaon tehsil, around 25km from Chhatarpur district HQ, alerted the forest department on Friday about leopard sightings in the area. Forest staff placed a cage to rescue the leopard. As the two rangers entered a farm, where the last sighting was reported, the leopard took them by surprise. It pounced on the duo, knocking them to the ground. Growling and snarling, the leopard mauled them badly before the villagers charged it and shooed it away. They were both rushed to the district hospital. Earlier this month, a leopard had strayed into Gadhakota village of Sagar. It was seen resting under in the house of a farmer, Mathura Patel, which lies vacant most of the year. By the time a forest team arrived, it was dark and they waited till the next morning to relocate it. Throughout the night, villagers stayed alert and patrolled the area with sticks. In the morning, the leopard had vanished.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-leopard-mauls-2-forest-rangers-in-chhatarpur/articleshow/87956570.cms||---

The private sector should also do the same. We have set limits on the number of tests that big and small health centers must conduct daily, below which they must not fall. We will be especially vigilant of travellers and their contacts,” director of health services Dr Ira Almeida said. Drop in testing will undermine actual infection spread: SecyWhen asked about concerns over Omicron, Almeida said it is very early to comment and that there’s no need to panic. “All those countries where the variant is found, except Hong Kong, were already on our list of mandatory testing on arrival. Other countries and airlines have also been mandating that travellers get tested and then travel,” she added. Stating that concerns about Omicron may push more people to get tested for Covid-19, Almeida said, “All this time, people were reluctant to get tested and kept thinking that all is well. Now people may come themselves to get tested.” “Daily infections are under 50. The department is monitoring the situation very closely,” she added. Meanwhile, GMC dean Dr S Bandekar said that people have turned complacent and are attending marriages and functions without wearing masks. “Complacency has set in and this is not a good thing. We cannot declare victory until the whole world is free from Covid. Only then can we say that the battle has been won. We have to keep reminding people to take precautions. The expert committee is keeping an eye on the positivity rate and looking out for red flags to control the situation, he said. In a letter to Goa and a few other states, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan highlighted the significant decline in weekly testing rates and highlighted the importance of maintaining high testing given the increase in travelling due to events like marriages, festive celebrations and vacations. “In absence of sustained levels of sufficient testing, it is very difficult to determine the true level of infection spread in a geography. With a majority of countries seeing multiple surges in Covid cases in recent times and a few developed countries facing even fourth and fifth waves despite high levels of Covid vaccinations, there is a need for continued vigil given the unpredictable and contagious nature of the disease,” he stated, adding that all efforts must be made to preserve the gains made so far and to prevent deterioration of Covid-19 scenario across the country. He also stated that decrease in testing will undermine the actual infection spread within the community. “With the onset of winter and increased pollution in some states, prevalence of ILI/ SARI and respiratory distress symptoms should be closely monitored with tests conducted regularly for timely monitoring and clustering of cases for early hotspot identification,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-govt-tells-health-centres-to-ramp-up-testing/articleshow/87956659.cms||---

Venues are booked till early next year, demand for jewellery has doubled, wedding photographers are refusing assignments for want of resources and time and wedding planners are pushing their bookings to later dates. The boom is on in the wedding trousseau market, too. According to a rough estimate, there were close to 2,000 weddings in Kolkata and its suburbs on November 21, the highest this season. The rush is expected to continue till the third week of December, and will resume again mid-January, after a short break. “The demand has almost doubled, and the industry has made a recovery from the losses in the past 20 months,” said Sunil Poddar, eastern region chairman, All India Gem and Jewellery Domestic Council. “There are several bigticket weddings scheduled in Kolkata this season. This boom in the wedding market is helping everybody, from the jewellers to the artisans.” The dip in Covid cases, rapid immunisation and easing of restrictions by the government has contributed heavily to the boom. According to the state government’s guidelines on Covid safety, a wedding venue can accommodate 70% of its total guest capacity. The hosts and owners of the venue must follow all current night curfew guidelines. After a gap of almost two years, the wedding season is back in full flow. Hundreds of mid-level weddings are happening almost every day and the number rises on weekends. A very big section of the population has been fully vaccinated and even the government has eased a lot of restrictions, which has caused the boom November-December,” said Ashish Saraf, a wedding consultant in Kolkata. According to Saraf, close to 15 industries — such as the ones dealing in wedding planning, venues, flowers, decoration, lights, wedding photography, food, transport, catering, entertainment and clothing — will get a good financial boost, riding on this boom. “The demand is very high this year,” said wedding photographer Prakash Dugar. “We are getting so many wedding assignments that we are running out of resources and time.” Also contributing to the rush are couples who got married during the second wave, with few or no guests, who now wish to celebrate with larger groups. They are competing for services with those who were scheduled to marry this year. “There are no auspicious dates for weddings between December 15 and January 15, 2022. But we are booked even during that period too, as a lot of people who got married during the second wave are throwing parties for friends and families,” said Rahul Goenka, owner of a banquet hall in Lake Town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/big-fat-kolkata-weddings-back-this-season-after-20-month-covid-lull/articleshow/87956664.cms||Zeeshan Javed

We will identify them and ensure they don’t come in the way,” Bommai told reporters. Besides the role of investigating officers, issues like producing the complainants and witnesses before court will be dealt with. Proper legal advice will be sought from experts, he said. Bommai said the prosecution has to take the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) raid very seriously and the government is planning to further tighten the norms governing procedures following raids. The CM added there should be a stringent follow-up of cases after ACB raids. “It should be done in a very professional manner and chargesheet against the culprits should be filed in court within a short period,” he said. Bommai pointed out there is a need to enhance coordination between ACB and the prosecution so as to increase the conviction rate in corruption cases. “I will take action to eliminate the existing loopholes in the law and see that corrupt persons can’t escape by misusing them,” he added. He said if ACB sleuths have substantial evidence against corrupt officers, higher-ups will definitely give them permission to conduct inquiry against the accused and there is no question of letting any corrupt officer go scot free. On the implementation of BJP’s 2018 manifesto to restore prosecution powers to the Lokayukta, he said he can’t speak on the issue since the high court is hearing a petition by the Lokayukta questioning the formation of ACB. “We have seen that ACB is doing an excellent job. We have given it a free hand,” he said, adding ACB has the power to register a case against corrupt employees under the Prevention of Corruption Act. Not aware of allegations against IAS officer: HMHome minister Araga Jnanendra said he does not have information about charges against any IAS officer in Shivamogga. He said there is no allegation against a senior bureaucrat of harassing a girl through chat. He claimed ACB has been strengthened during the BJP government. Stating it was a routine raid on corrupt officers, he said ACB will file a chargesheet if they’re found guilty. Usually, it takes time to collect evidence, he added. Jnanendra said the government is proposing to upgrade Shivamogga into a commissionerate. Bhadravathi will also be included.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/will-take-steps-to-up-conviction-rate-in-corruption-cases-karnataka-cm-basavaraj-bommai/articleshow/87956680.cms||---
---||Goa||Centre eases HTL norms for Goa in khazan, sluice gate areas||PANAJI: The Union environment ministry on Friday has issued a notification amending the coastal regulation zone (CRZ) norms of 2019, based on representations from Goa. The amended notification states that in cases where salt water ingress has taken place beyond the bund or sluice gate and this area is under mangroves, the area will be classified as CRZ-IA and will be protected from diversion of the land for any developmental activities. The notification also allows restricting the High Tide Line (HTL) up to the line of the sluice gate in khazan land areas. The latest notification issued on Friday now fulfils one of the major demands various communities living around CRZ areas in Goa had made during the preparation of the Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) for Goa. Centre granted relaxation on HTL up to bund, sluice gate last yearBased on representations from different panchayats and municipalities to restrict the HTL only up to the bund and sluice gate, the state environment ministry had written to the Centre seeking the relaxation for the state. However, though the relaxation was granted last year, the CRZ notification of 2019 has been amended now to include this change. The new clause inserted in the 2019 notification reads, “in case there exists a bund or a sluice gate constructed prior to the date of notification issued dated February 19, 1991, the HTL shall be restricted up to the line long along the bund or the sluice gate. However, in such a case, area under mangroves arising due to saline water ingress beyond the bund or sluice gate shall be classified as CRZ-IA irrespective of the extent of the area beyond the bund or sluice gate and such areas under mangroves shall be protected and shall not be diverted for any developmental activities.” The Union ministry had issued notification on January 18, 2019, which had declared certain coastal stretches as CRZ and restrictions were imposed on the setting up and expansion of industries, operations and processes. But the central government received representations from Goa stating that relaxations given to Goa in demarcating HTL in khazan land up to the bund and sluice gate had been included in the CRZ notification of 2011. Goa said that these relaxations were, however, not made part of the CRZ notification 2019. “The provisions related to demarcation of HTL in khazan land to the bund/sluice gate were incorporated in the CRZ notification 2011, through amendment dated May 1, 2020, however, these provisions could not be incorporated in CRZ notification 2019, as it was notified on January 18, 2019,” the ministry’s notification issued on November 26 states. The National Coastal Zone Management Authority (NCZMA) in its 42nd meeting held on March 23 this year recommended that the relaxations to Goa should be included in the CRZ notification, 2019, and accordingly Friday’s notification was issued by the ministry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/centre-eases-htl-norms-for-goa-in-khazan-sluice-gate-areas/articleshow/87956689.cms||---
---||Bhopal||1/3rd population under poverty in Madhya Pradesh||BHOPAL: Over one-third population of Madhya Pradesh lives under poverty- a recent report released by the NITI Aayog terms it Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI). The report says MP is fourth poorest state in India, only above Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh. Roughly over 2.5 crore people in Madhya Pradesh are poor. Alirajpur has the highest population -71.31%- under the poverty bracket followed by 68.86% population under poverty in the neighbouring Jhabua and 61.60% in Barwani, a place with moat malnourished children. The least literate district of India according to the 2011 census, Alirajpur was carved out from Jhabua as a separate district on May 17 2008 with a promise of overall development. Thirteen years after its formation, it is the poorest place in Madhya Pradesh. The report said that 36.65 % people in MP are poor. As per the index, 51.91 % population of Bihar is poor, followed by 42.16 % in Jharkhand, 37.79 % in Uttar Pradesh. After MP, Meghalaya (32.67 % ) is at the fifth spot. Only 0.71 % of the population is poor in Kerala, the most literate state of the country. Goa (3.76 %), Sikkim (%), Tamil Nadu (4.89% ) and Punjab (5.59 % ) have registered lowest poverty figures across India and were placed at the bottom of the index. According to the report, India's national MPI measure uses the globally accepted and robust methodology developed by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). As a measure of multidimensional poverty, the report captures multiple and simultaneous deprivation faced by households. The report said, India's MPI has three equally weighted dimensions: health, education and standard of living - which are represented by 12 indicators namely nutrition, child and adolescent mortality, antenatal care, years of schooling, school attendance, cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing, assets and bank accounts. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) framework, adopted by 193 countries in 2015, has redefined development policies, government priorities, and metrics for measuring development progress across the world. The national MPI measure has been constructed by utilizing 12 key components which cover areas such as health and nutrition, education and standard of living, he said. Besides talking about the tribal regions of Madhya Pradesh, the report also shows that all the districts of Bundelkhand in MP have more than 40 % population under poverty. There are 27 districts in Madhya which have under 40 % in poverty. Jabalpur, Bhopal and Indore are at the bottom of the index with 19.50%, 12.91% and 10.86 % population in poverty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/1/3rd-population-under-poverty-in-madhya-pradesh/articleshow/87956675.cms||Deshdeep Saxena
---||Goa||Will act as per law against structure at Old Goa heritage site: CM||MARGAO: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Saturday assured that action will be taken over the controversial structure at Old Goa “in accordance with law”. “I have instructed the town and country planning (TCP) department and the panchayat concerned to check the documents, and that if they aren’t in order, to stop it,” Sawant told reporters on the sidelines of a function in Margao. The chief minister, however, said that he was yet to receive any official correspondence or a petition in that regard from those who were demanding that the structure be demolished. “Those who want the structure to be demolished ought to make official correspondence, and not make demands through the media. If it is illegal, let it be demolished,” he said. Sawant said that his government hasn’t supported construction of any illegal structure during his tenure as the chief minister. He alleged that a “staunch supporter” of a former minister had obtained all permissions for its construction, but stopped short of naming anyone. “The private plot was purchased by a third party, and a staunch supporter of a former minister obtained all licences for the construction,” Sawant said. No links with structure: CM If it’s illegal, somebody should have written to the authorities, which hasn’t yet happened. But now that people are agitating over it, the government will act on it.” He said that neither he nor his party had any links with the controversial structure. Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai had on Friday said that neither he as TCP minister nor his GFP was involved in issuing permissions for the controversial structure. TCP minister Chandrakant Kavlekar had earlier reportedly stated that a former TCP minister had issued permissions for the structure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-act-as-per-law-against-structure-at-old-goa-heritage-site-cm/articleshow/87956712.cms||---
---||Goa||From lounges to live DJs to selfie points, Goa beach shacks up their game||The state’s beach shacks, which over the past decade have gone beyond offering just a dining facility on the shore, have gone a step ahead this season. A stroll along the popular Calangute-Baga stretch reveals that shacks now have a loungelike facility with sofas, fancy lighting, hookahs, live DJs, as well as selfie-friendly “installations” for tourists inclined towards social media. The winds of change first blow along the beach stretches of Calangute and Baga, and these trends are eventually adopted by shacks on other beaches in the state, albeit with slightly lesser grandeur. As shacks opened this season after around a year and a half of bad business, the competition for customers is intense. Colourful lights shine bright, luring customers walking along the beach. Once in, the customers find that the usual hard chairs have been replaced by sofas — at added cost, of course. A shack operator in Calangute said that he has paid Rs 2 lakh to have seven sofas installed, and that guests using this lounge facility need to raise a minimum bill of Rs 4,000. Tourists eager to click seflies at electrified installationsThere is so much competition, I had to have sofas, and to recover the cost, I have to charge extra. It’s not that I don’t take in customers who will just have a few beers and whose bill is less than Rs 1,000. They can always use a humble table if their spending capacity is low.” The operator has instructed his waiters to inform customers using the lounge that their bills need to be more than Rs 4000, to avoid any misunderstanding later. “Probably, by next season, all shacks will have sofas, and we will not be able to charge more. Let me make some money this season,” he said. However, what’s really striking at Calangute and Baga is the lighting decor by shacks. Apart from some being “decorated like Christmas trees”, others have electrified installations in the shapes of hearts, balloons, and coconut trees, sometimes along the entire area in front of the shack. One operator said that the lighting has been “improved” for the benefit of desi tourists, as well as to make their shacks look beautiful at night. “I have five poles in front of my shack in hues of blue, each costing Rs 5,000,” said an operator. “Since others have done it, how can I not do anything?” While the jury is out on whether lighting actually does make shacks more beautiful or attract customers, there is no doubt that the electrified installations serve as an important backdrop for tourists to click selfies — the heart shaped ‘I love Goa’ being an enduring favourite. Most operators declined to be named, as some have rented their shacks. Some shacks have hired DJs to draw a crowd. “Any professional DJ charges Rs 3,000-4,000 a night, while others can be hired for Rs 2,000 a night. I have a DJ who I pay Rs 30,000 a month to play every night, rather than select nights during weekends and peak periods,” an operator said. This year, he has made a cabin for the DJ, following in the footsteps of a few bigger shacks. Those who cannot afford a DJ, he said, operate their own music system, as all shacks now have the facility, and most blast music till midnight, only switching it off if the police show up. Unsurprisingly, with the competition intense, waiters, who work on commission basis, have to attract passing tourists, often by shouting out the menu of hard drinks over the blaring music. The beach shack policy mandates that music should be turned off by10pm. Kishore from Uttarakhand, who works as a waiter at a Calangute shack, said “Tourists are often confused by the heavy lighting decor and the tables and chairs that cover the whole beach, at times. They can’t distinguish one one shack from another. Sometimes, they ask us why so many people (waiters) follow them telling them the same thing, again and again. They think of all shacks as one unit”. He also cautioned tourists desiring to have hookah to ask for the price before placing the order, lest they be charged Rs 1,000 for a Rs 500 bottle. “The price depends on the size of the bottle rather than the flavour,” he said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/from-lounges-to-live-djs-to-selfie-points-beach-shacks-up-their-game/articleshow/87956739.cms||---

An agreement to this effect was reached during Khan’s visit to the kingdom last month. During Khan’s visit, the Saudi government had promised to deposit $3bn in Pakistan’s account for a year and keep it rolling at least until the completion of the IMF programme in October 2023. According to officials, the amount of the agreed deposit will be received within the next couple of days. Pakistan, however, would pay the Saudi government a 4% yearly profit on this sum. The facility was apparently aimed to help Pakistan convince the IMF about its financing plan. In addition, Riyadh had also promised to provide crude oil to Islamabad on deferred payments worth up to $1.5bn per annum. Saudi Arabia had also provided $3bn in cash deposits and promised a $3bn oil facility to Pakistan to help the latter shore up its foreign exchange reserves in 2018. However, as bilateral relations deteriorated later, Islamabad had to return $2bn of the $3bn deposits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/cash-starved-pakistan-to-keep-3b-from-riyadh-in-central-bank/articleshow/87956580.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||Chennai||Digital divide keeps close to 66% of guest workers’ kids from online classes in Tamil Nadu||CHENNAI: As many as 66% of children of guest workers could not attend online classes during the various lockdowns due to lack of gadgets such as laptops, desktop and android phones. They had no money to recharge their prepaid phone, according to a study on the impact of Covid-19 on learning of children of guest workers in Tamil Nadu 2021. The study, conducted in March and April this year, showed that the lockdown exacerbated the effects of the digital divide and denied such children access to education, nutritious meals, health and immunization services. The longer the schools remain closed, the longer these children are cut off from these critical elements of childhood. It also said the Right to Education (RTE) Act 2009 failed them. “Free and compulsory education became a mirage,” said the study done by Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) - Watch Tamil Nadu, a collective of five civil society organisations working among migrant labourers. The study, released on Saturday, found language was a barrier for such children, with 288 (69%) of 419 respondents confirming it. “Since they are unable to continue schooling in their mother tongue in the host state, it is likely to lead to their dropping out,” said S Venkataraman, a member of the research team. Among children of interstate workers, those accompanying parents to brick kilns are the worst affected as they are totally cut off from education as the kilns are in remote areas and far away from schools. It also demystified the theory that only children of inter-state migrants were affected. “Majority of the children are from other districts in the state. They lack support systems and electronic devices to attend online classes,” said Edwin of SDG-Watch TN. Guest workers, according to the study, look to education to escape from poverty, but lack the resources to help their children continue their studies. “The source and destination states along with the Centre should come up with proactive measures to bring back children to school. The authorities should develop mechanisms to register and track each member of migrants, particularly children, and absorb them into schools wherever they are. If they fail, it will result in loss of childhood, increase in child labourers and child marriages,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/digital-divide-keeps-close-to-66-of-guest-workers-kids-from-online-classes-in-tamil-nadu/articleshow/87956738.cms||Shanmughasundarm j

Vasundhara is former PWD minister Kshiti Goswami’s daughter. Her mother Sunanda Mukherjee was among CM Mamata Banerjee’s first appointees as the West Bengal Women’s Commission chairperson back in 2011. Vasundhara had taken the TMC flag in 2020 and worked extensively in the 2021 assembly elections, including in Nandigram. “I am happy that the party has given me this responsibility. The party leaders and workers have been my source of encouragement and strength. I chose TMC over Left parties because I felt TMC to be more inclusive. The Left has certain inexplicable rigidity to it. My father has always been my idol, but Left politics hasn’t really drawn me. I know my father’s colleagues will be peeved, my mother too is anxious, but I want to work hard and make an impact” she said. Vasundhara will contest from Ward 96 vacated by Debabrata Majumdar due to reservation. This ward with stretches of Bagha Jatin to Regent Estate was once a Left bastion. On Saturday, outgoing CPM coordinator from Ward 75 Bilkis Begum took the Trinamool flag a day after the Left Front dropped her from the candidate list. Bilkis after joining Trinamool in presence of transport minister Firhad Hakim didn’t cite her not getting the ticket as a reason for leaving the CPM. “Denying me the ticket is not an issue. I could not bear the insult I was facing in CPM anymore,” Bilkis said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/trinamool-ticket-for-ex-lf-mins-daughter/articleshow/87954309.cms||---

At a press conference here on Saturday, BTP state president Vela Ram Ghogra said the Gehlot government had assured to fulfil 18 promises within six months, but a year-and-a-half later, they were not ready to even talk about the demands. "Two of our MLAs stood by the government at a time when their own legislators tried to topple it. Gehlot had told everyone that he would not forget those who helped him in crisis. Our party had expected that they (Gehlot) would at least talk to us before the cabinet expansion, but he didn't bother to even give us a phone call," said Ghogra. 'Forging pacts with smaller parties'Ghogra claimed that Gehlot agreed on fulfilling backlog in recruitments, changes in forest rights Act, reservation in TSP areas, ownership of tribals in mines, among others. Disclosing the details of their future alliance, Ghogra said after being betrayed by the Congress, they were forging pacts with smaller parties like the AIMIM, the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Rashtriya Loktanrik Party (RLP). "Our national leaders will decide the alliance with AIMIM, but in the state, we have initiated talks with SDPI and RLP leaders. Our meeting with AAP will take place in December. In January, we will announce a major alliance to take on the communal and opportunist politics of the BJP and the Congress," said Ghogra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rajasthan-we-saved-ashok-gehlot-govt-but-they-didnt-keep-promises-says-btp/articleshow/87956822.cms||---

Right to establish an educational institution is a fundamental right and restricting and forcing the institutions to beg for recognition every year amounts to an unreasonable restriction, the association said. Admitting the plea, Justice M Dhandapani directed the school education department to file its response in two weeks. According to All India Private Educational Institutions Association, there is no such provision under the Tamil Nadu Recognised Private Schools (Regulation) Act, which can be invoked for restricting the recognition for a fixed period. As per the provisions of the act, recognition can be withdrawn only under the circumstances stated under Section 12 of the act, the petitioner said. “It was this court that settled the issue in 2017 by setting aside an order of grant of temporary recognition,” the association added. The school by nature is permanent and is periodically submitting the required certificates as required by the statute, they said. The association added that the object of the GO is not in consonance with the private school act which provides for unhindered administration unless there are errors on the part of the management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/private-schools-move-madras-hc-over-temporary-recognition-from-tamil-nadu-govt/articleshow/87956745.cms||---

To their surprise, the couple found that cash and jewellery were missing. In the FIR, the complainant alleged that CCTV footage of the hotel showed that around 8.30pm, two hotel employees were seen opening their room, which hinted at the alleged collusion of the hotel staff. Police said based on the complainant's FIR, they filed a case under Sections 454 (lurking house-trespass or house-breaking), 380 (theft) and 120B (criminal conspiracy). 'He was roaming with group that came for the wedding' Meanwhile, Hotel Clarks Amer released a statement on Saturday denying the involvement of its employees. "In view of the theft which took place at Hotel Clarks Amer, police is investigating. No employee of the hotel is involved in the crime. The hotel authorities are fully co-operating with police. In the CCTV coverage, which has been handed over to police, the culprit can be seen. Police is thoroughly investigating the case," the statement read. The hotel's senior security officer, SR Sharma, told TOI that the suspect had arrived in an auto-rickshaw and he was checked twice by the hotel's security staff. "He (suspect) claimed that he had come for a wedding. He was roaming around with other guests who had come for the wedding," Sharma said. He also claimed that there was an 'event desk' in the lobby to attend to the wedding guests staying in 45 rooms. "The man also picked up a card key from the same desk, because of which staff was under the impression that he was one of the guests. All the time he was roaming with the group that had come for the wedding, he even escorted them to their rooms," Sharma said, adding that the suspect left the hotel twice and returned with different attire. Sharma told TOI that the suspect had called up the reception desk from the intercom on the seventh floor and asked for his room to be opened. "Our staff followed the standard operation procedure (SOP) and verified his room number and name which matched with the occupant's details on the computer," he added. Additional DCP (Jaipur-East) Avnish Kumar Sharma said the case was being examined from all aspects while SHO Radha Raman Gupta said some suspects had been questioned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jaipur-unnamed-hotel-staff-booked-for-conspiracy-in-rs-2-crore-jewellery-loot/articleshow/87956858.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi civic polls: 5-time Congress councillor among many members joining AAP||NEW DELHI: In a blow to Congress before the upcoming municipal elections, two sitting councillors, including Mukesh Goel, who is one of the tallest Congress functionaries in North Delhi Municipal Corporation, joined Aam Aadmi Party on Saturday. They were welcomed by deputy CM Manish Sisodia. AAP in a statement said that five-time municipal councillor Mukesh Goel and two-time councillor Parma Bhai Solanki, along with several Congress office-bearers and supporters joined AAP. “Under the leadership of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, AAP worked in the interests of the public, which was considered impossible in Indian politics. Mukesh Goyal is joining the party today after being impressed by the way AAP has worked in Delhi in the fields of education, health, water, electricity among others,” Sisodia said in a press conference. He added that AAP is a movement to provide better facilities to the public and welcomed all the new members with the hope that they will serve the society. Goel said he was impressed with Kejriwal model of development. “The model of development developed by Kejriwal in Delhi is being discussed across the country. AAP is doing commendable work and the public is receiving its benefits. Opposing the party did not feel right. This is why I left the Congress and joined AAP to work in the interest of the public,” Goel said. Goel has been chairperson of the standing committee three times in past. Meanwhile, in a separate function, different politicians from Congress and BJP joined AAP. AAP MLA Dilip Pandey welcomed current councillor of the Congress from Badli assembly constituency area Poonam Bagri. Her husband also joined AAP besides dozens of other people. AAP national secretary Pankaj Gupta said that people were joining AAP after being impressed by the work that has been done by the Kejriwal government in all areas, including schools, hospitals, electricity, water, roads, WiFi, etc. “They have not only made AAP bigger but also stronger and more ready to win the upcoming municipal polls. Everyone will work the best that they can, in a disciplined manner and together, sweep the corporation,” Pandey said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-civic-polls-5-time-congress-councillor-among-many-members-joining-aap/articleshow/87956873.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Arrest warrant against former Union minister Jitendra Singh for forgery||KOTA: A chief judicial magistrate court (CJM) in Bundi has issued arrest warrants against former Union minister and Congress leader Jitendra Singh of Alwar, his father-in-law and another person for alleged cheating and forgery of a trust deed to take over the property of the erstwhile Bundi royal family. Taking cognisance of the case under IPC sections 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating), 471 (using a forged document as genuine) and 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy) pertaining to erstwhile property of Bundi royal family, CJM Bundi on November 18 ordered to issue arrest warrant (copy of which was obtained the petitioner on Friday) against Singh, his father-in-law Bijendra Singh and former Bundi zila pramukh Nath Singh Hada. The court ordered that the three be produced before it on January 6, 2022. On the basis of a complaint filed by Avinash Kumar Chandna, a resident of Safdarjung Enclave in New Delhi, who claimed to be a friend of late Ranjeet Singh, son of late Bahadur Singh, the last king of erstwhile Bundi royal family, Bundi city police lodged a case against the three in December 2017. Chandana alleged that the trio hatched a conspiracy to take over the property of the erstwhile ruler who did not have any child. Singh is the son of Mahendra Kumari, the sister of erstwhile ruler Ranjeet Singh. It was alleged that the Congress leader forged his maternal uncle's (mamaji) signature in backdate of May 2008 to transfer property to himself through a forged trust deed. Chandna claimed that Ranjeet Singh stayed with him in Delhi till his last breath in 2010 and transferred all his property to him in 2009. Chandna alleged that the Congress leader, in order to take over the property of his maternal uncle, created Kul Devi Ashapura Mataji Trust and, through a forged deed, committed all the property to the Trust headed by himself. The CJM court, while issuing the arrest warrant, said that ex-Union minister Singh and the two others tried to deceive it by submitting the fake trust deed presented as genuine. The CJM court observed that Singh did not provide the original copy of the Trust deed to the investigating officer but provided a report by private forensic laboratory authenticating the deed as genuine. The Bundi city police, however, filed a final report (FR) on the basis of this forensic report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rajasthan-arrest-warrant-against-former-union-minister-jitendra-singh-for-forgery/articleshow/87956880.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||‘Haryana farmers made the way for Delhi, not backing out of Mission Punjab’||Bhartiya Kisan Union (Charuni) president Gurnam Singh Charuni is not going to back down from his ‘Mission Punjab’, the farm unionist’s political plunge in Punjab. Speaking to TOI’s Manvir Saini, Charuni said he will not contest himself, but will field candidates on all 117 assembly seats of the state. He added farmers from Haryana too made a major contribution to the success of the farm agitation and that farmers will return home only after the Centre gives a legal guarantee on MSP and announces compensation for the kin of those who died during the agitation. The Union government has started the process of repealing the three farm laws which triggered the protest. What next? Repealing the laws is one of our four major demands. Our main demand is MSP guarantee. Most importantly, (our other demand is) withdrawal of cases registered against farmers. At the moment, 48,000 farmers from Punjab and Haryana are facing criminal cases registered by police over the past year. Also, we want adequate compensation for the next of kin of farmers who have died on the Delhi borders during the agitation. What are your electoral plans? Will you still go ahead with Mission Punjab, given the stiff opposition from SKM? We will move forward as per plan. We will go ahead with Mission Punjab. I will never contest elections from Punjab. But, yes, we will field candidates on all 117 seats. The agitation is in its last leg. Once we are through, we will float a party and announce candidates for Punjab. The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) has been constituted to put a joint fight against the three laws and other demands of farmers. This decision of going into electoral politics is our — BKU (Charuni)’s — independent decision and we are not bound to follow anyone. We will go ahead with Mission Punjab and decide on other states later. How do you justify farm unionists entering electoral politics? You made this attempt ahead of 2019 assembly elections in Haryana as well? Politics needs serious reform. Unlike others who think of resorting to electoral poltics for personal growth and development, my wish is to ensure cleaner politics and that power is with the real stakeholders, the farmers. I have contested an election in the past. Dig out my campaigning videos, I just gave calls to create awareness among farmers and voters. Mission Punjab will be a wake-up call for farmers and masses. What helped the most in forcing the government to repeal laws? How do you see the contribution of farmers from Haryana? The spirit of farmers, who carried out this agitation with peace and patience, was the biggest reason for success. Despite hardships and conspiracies, farmers did not budge. This led to the public sentiment growing against the government and in favour of farmers. Farmers from Haryana breached the barricades at Shambhu, Kurukshetra and Karnal. They fought the government to pave way for our entire community. Despite resistance by some of our own leaders from Punjab who chose to sit at Shambhu, efforts by farmers from Haryana took them to Delhi borders. Lastly, we had announced to oppose all those in power. Even the Haryana CM was not allowed to land in Karnal. While referring to Rakesh Tikait, you had been saying that people should concentrate on UP as well. Why? I meant to say was that one should out of their state only after the base there is strong. One should motivate the people of other states only after you have done it in your state. I had only started going out when farmers in Haryana had closed all toll plazas. Be rest assured, we are part of the same platform and team. STANDALONE QUOTE In Haryana, we had been protesting since September 10 and our brothers in Punjab had been protesting at their end too. But, it was only after our farmers who breached 64 barricades to reach Karnal that the agitation got a new direction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-farmers-made-the-way-for-delhi-not-backing-out-of-mission-punjab/articleshow/87955157.cms||Manvir Saini
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: 4 inmates kill youth at de-addiction centre, held||CHENNAI: Four inmates of a de-addiction centre in Red Hills on Friday murdered a 21-year-old youth from Andhra Pradesh undergoing treatment there, allegedly because he told the authorities about their behaviour, police said. All the accused including two juveniles have been arrested. Police who identified the deceased as M Vamsi of Chittoor district, said of the arrested D Benin, 22, of Tiruvallur district and I Yasin Sherif, 36, of Red Hills, were sent to jail, while the juveniles, aged 17, were sent to the correctional facility for boys and girls at Kellys. All of them were inmates of Pioneer De-Addiction Centre at Vijaya Nagar near Kavangarai in Red Hills. Police said Vamsi had tipped off the staff at the centre about how the four inmates constantly violated the rules including failing to adhere to the queue while taking bath or having food, chatting till late at night and bossing over the other inmates leading to stringent punishment to them. The owner Ruben Paul, himself a former addict, stayed with his family on the ground floor, while 40 inmates including two senior citizens in their 70s were put up in dormitories on the first floor. The prayer hall and the sharing rooms are on the second floor. In the sharing room, where inmates would relate their individual experiences of getting addicted to various substances, a CCTV camera shows the four suspects asking Vamsi to come there around 8pm on Friday, police said. Accordingly, at the ‘appointed time,’ he was walking to the second floor when the suspects intercepted him, covered his face with a bedsheet and dragged him into a bathroom, police said, adding that all this was captured on camera. They then set upon him with buckets and handheld fire extinguishers. Only two staff members were on the second floor at the time, while the others were either preparing food or engaged in other work. The four accused then came out of the bathroom, screaming that they had killed an inmate and asking the staff to call police. They then dragged Vamsi towards the main door and left him there. This too was recorded on CCTV cameras. Later, one of them tampered with a camera and a recording unit. While the staff locked the main gates, the suspects locked the door from inside on the first floor to avoid the staff entering. The staff tried to break open the door using a crowbar and hammers, while the assailants set fire to clothes and threw them at the staff. Police were informed and a team led by Puzhal assistant commissioner S Athi Moolam and Red Hills inspector Ramesh arrived at the place. Police sent the body to a government hospital for postmortem and nabbed the four suspects. Of them, police said, Benin had been earlier involved in an attempt to murder case and a ganja smuggling case within Vellavedu police limits of Tiruvallur district. Ruben Paul, a native of Salem who has been staying in Chennai’s Kolathur area for the past two decades, has been running the de-addiction centre from 2013, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-4-inmates-kill-youth-at-de-addiction-centre-held/articleshow/87956773.cms||---

The dharna was jointly presided over by senior farmer leaders Baruram Muklan and Krishna Kumar Sawat. Numberdar said the statement of the CM and deputy CM that farmers should now leave the movement and go back home is misleading. He also alleged that the compensation for the damaged crops of kharif 2020 has not been given till date and that the insurance company swallowed Rs 1,000 crore from just Hisar district. He also said due to heavy rains and red bollworm, entire crops were ruined this kharif season. “Till date, the assessment of their loss has not even been completed,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hry-should-issue-white-paper-on-crop-procured-this-kharif-season/articleshow/87955166.cms||---
---||Noida||‘Kya hai?’ Woman alleges cops hit her car, misbehaved||Noida: A 53-year-old woman working with a bank in Delhi has alleged that two cops seated in an SUV that had hit her brand new Kia Seltos from behind misbehaved with her when she accused them of rough driving. Anju Khosla said she was on her way home to Noida from her bank in Lajpat Nagar when a Bolero hit her car from behind and drove past her near Golf Course metro station around 7.30pm on Friday. She, however, stepped on the accelerator, overtook the police Bolero and shouted at them to stop. “I was surprised to see there were policemen inside the vehicle. When I asked them why they had hit my car, one of them shouted ‘kya hai (what is it?). There were curtains covering the rear windows, so I could not see if there was anybody sitting on the rear seat. They said they would speak to me after parking the vehicle on the side of the road, but they sped away,” she alleged. The bank manager drove to the Sector 37 police outpost and narrated what had happened to the officer present there. “But he just noted down my name, address and other details,” she said. Anju then tweeted about the incident, attaching pictures of the Bolero and her Seltos, and tagged the commissioner of police. An inquiry has now been ordered into her complaint. “I have spoken to the complainant. The Bolero seems to be allotted to an officer. However, she could not see if there was anybody in the rear seat. The number plate of the vehicle is unclear. We are checking footage,” said ACP 1 (Noida) Ankita Sharma, who is conducting the inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/kya-hai-woman-alleges-cops-hit-her-car-misbehaved/articleshow/87955188.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Wake up call by hornbill from NE||December is the most special month in the North East (NE). It starts with the Hornbill, dubbed as the ‘festival of festivals’, culminating in Christmas. Notwithstanding, ‘Act East’ policy; growing dependency of hospitality and retail industries, on admirable soft skills of NE workforce, our connect with the region remains tenuous and tentative. Very few Indians, outside uniform, visit NE, certainly less than those headed abroad. No wonder Chinese are establishing border villages and our settlements are turning into ghost ones. Can we motivate institutions in hinterland, to visit border areas and in the interim forge web connectivity? Hornbill festival showcases ethnic diversity of 16-odd tribes, loosely bundled, within Naga identity. The challenge for most Indians is to fully comprehend their yearnings for recognition of unique identities. This quest, bordering on insecurity has spurred multiple insurgencies. It has resulted in creation of seven sisters and brother, across Siliguri corridor. States are complemented by 27 autonomous councils, under Sixth Schedule for Bodos, Dimasas, Kacharis, Kukis, Karbis and other tribes. Accordingly, the governors in these states are entrusted with additional responsibilities and powers. The moot question remains — have we been getting desired results?  December 1 is a defining landmark, for in 1963, Nagaland was carved out of greater Assam, on this date. This literally unleashed ‘Domino effect’ of assertion of identities, resulting in upgradation of Manipur, Tripura and Meghalaya, to full fledged ones in 1972, and creation of Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram in 1987. Identity fixation, lack of clarity on state borders, conflicting clan ownerships, pressure on reserved forests, exacerbated by proliferation of arms results in inter-state clashes. It is indeed ironical, as most of the states are being ruled by same political dispensation. The next obvious poser is — effect of mainland politics on already vitiated NE dynamics in terms of mainstreaming? This year, most unfortunately, we were forced to take an early reality check with dastardly and unprecedented ambush in Manipur, targeting AR Colonel and his family, a new low in NE. It reminded us that all is certainly not well. China card and ascendancy of military junta in Myanmar has altered the ground realities. Ruili, on Sino-Myanmar border, has become hub for NE ultras, with Paresh Barua of ULFA (I) and Phunthing Shimrang of NSCN (IM), my old colleague in Cease Fire Monitoring Group, Manohar Mayum of PLA, all reportedly sheltered there. Two competing strands of separatism are driven by NSCN (IM) and United Liberation Front of Western South East Asia (UNLFW), umbrella conglomeration of anti-IM groups like ULFA and Khaplang factions. However, aging Muivah and his NSCN remain the key to resolving Gordian knot of seven-decade-old insurgency, which has defied conventional templates of conflict resolution. Likely splintering of IM, in post Muivah scenario, may only add to complexities. Interlocutor approach has seen number of experts, both in NE and J&K. Intelligence background of recent appointees is an interesting trend, however, it is yet to deliver expected results. Popularly held belief that proxy war was initiated in 80s, misses the very first markers, Phizo escaping to erstwhile East Pakistan and Mowu Angami to China in 50s. There was continued support and sanctuary, till clamp down by Sheikh Hasina. China recently, openly threatened to revive support to NE rebels. There is compelling need to quell centrifugal forces aided by external mischief makers.  Brief era of cooperation with Myanmar is getting frayed with military regime, colluding with rebel groups, to quell anti-coup populace, limiting options of targeting terrorists across. Myanmar and Bangladesh have expressed concern on increased meddling by ISI. Pakistan is providing considerable support to groups, inimical to Indian interests. Altered dynamics have stymied connectivity projects like Kaladan multi-modal project, catalyst in the Act East Policy.  The need is to critically examine recent ambush, linkages (internal and external) and narco-terrorism angles. Two perpetrators, Peoples Liberation Army, dormant Meitei group, and obscure Manipur Naga Peoples Front have linkages with China sheltered umbrella group, UNFLW. NIA having taken over the investigation, it is hoped that agency will address all issues expeditiously. It will be worthwhile, if at least sanitized portions of NIA reports are shared and subjected to expert review. It appears that we are unable to close investigation loop in time and tackle collaborators. In parts of Manipur-Churachandpur (recent attack) and Chandel (ambush in 2015), writ of security and enforcement agencies continues to be sub-optimal. This results in AR, tackling narco-terrorism, without matching support, from other agencies. These incidents by UNFWA affiliated groups in Zomi and Kuki dominated areas (with groups, in suspension of operations mode), in proximity to Myanmar border, mandate enhanced domination, surveillance and coordination with Zomis and Kukis. While the nation has been assured of suitable retaliatory actions, options are restricted. Unfortunately, essence of problem is episodic responses and top-down approach emanating from Delhi. It is time to expedite resolution of Naga problem and engage with all groups. NE Council needs to be revitalized with autonomy and funds, modeled on Niti Ayog. Creation of separate NE Security Council would only add another avoidable layer. It may seem utopian but refined ‘Laldenga approach’ should be revisited with Muivah being offered NE Council chairmanship, and Paresh Barua its membership. As an additional sop, Muivah can be given enhanced status. Issues of sovereignt,y especially separate flag and constitution-require nuanced resolution, possibly after forthcoming assembly elections. Concurrently, 6,000-odd cadres could be absorbed in security related and other vocations. The crying need is to replace extortion and narco-terrorism driven economy with functional one.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/wake-up-call-by-hornbill-from-ne/articleshow/87955186.cms||---
---||Amritsar||Kolkata Sikh woman goes to Pakistan with hubby, ‘weds’ Lahore man||ATTARI: A married Sikh woman from Kolkata who was part of a jatha that visited Pakistan for Gurpurb “converted and married” a Muslim man at Lahore. She was apparently accompanied by her Indian husband during the pilgrimage and marriage. According to sources, the woman, Parminder Kaur (name changed), had crossed the international border from Attari on November 17 to take part in celebrations on the birth anniversary of first Sikh master Guru Nanak Dev. She married Lahore resident Muhammad Imran on November 24. Intelligence sources here said that before marrying Imran, she embraced Islam and was rechristened as Parveena Sultan after filing a petition in a Lahore court. A Lahore-based deed writer Rana Sajawal confirmed that the Indian woman, accompanied by two men including a Sikh, had come to purchase an affidavit. He said since the women didn’t have any Pakistani identification, he had issued the document in the name of Imran, a resident of Rajan Pur area. Sources said that Kaur had met Imran on social media and her husband was aware of her ties. While confirming the incident, SAD (D) president Paramjit Singh Sarna, who is also the former president of Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, said the marriage of a Bengali Sikh woman with a Lahore man had brought much embarrassment to the community. “Such acts can even lead to a ban on Sikh pilgrimage to Pakistan,” said Sarna. He also advised the pilgrims going to Pakistan as part of jathas to restrict themselves to religious activities. According to sources, Imran wanted to come to India but couldn't as he didn’t have an Indian visa. Similarly, Kaur was denied permission to stay in Pakistan, following which, she and her Indian husband arrived at Attari on late Friday evening and reached Kolkata on Saturday. Sources opined that she would apply for Pakistan visa to be with her Muslim husband.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/kolkata-sikh-woman-goes-to-pakistan-with-hubby-weds-lahore-man/articleshow/87956937.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Chandigarh||HAU’s pedal operated maize shelling machine gets design patent||Hisar: Indian Patent office has granted design patent to pedal operated maize shelling machine developed at Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agricultural University (CCSHAU). Vice-chancellor B R Kamboj said the design is simple and has been developed and fabricated by Vijay K Singh and M K Garg in association with Vinay Kumar of the processing and food engineering department of the university. Amarjeet Kalra, dean, College of Agricultural Engineering and Technology, said the shelling efficiency (99.25 %) and cleaned outlet grain (98.45%) of the machine is the highest. Moreover, its repair and maintenance cost is also very less. Ravi Gupta, head, processing and food engineering department said the shelling capacity of pedal operated shelling machine is between 55 and 60kg per hectare, which is nearly four times more than the manual shelling. “In India maize is an important crop after rice and wheat. Many farmers grow maize but most of them could not afford the cost of acquiring some of the imported threshing machines. They have to resort to manual means of threshing, which result in low efficiency, wastage of grains and require more labour. This machine, fabricated from locally available material, could be an affordable alternative to farmers,” the VC added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haus-pedal-operated-maize-shelling-machine-gets-design-patent/articleshow/87955192.cms||---
