Speaking in the monthly episode of his ‘Awaam ki Awaaz’ radio programme, Lt Governor also congratulated national topper of NEET-UG Tanmay Gupta and cricketer Umran Malik and termed them as the new role models for the younger generation of J&K. Several landmark decisions of the government are steering people’s empowerment, taking J&K towards new heights of development and prosperity, the Lt Governor said. For the first time in the history of Jammu and Kashmir, 7,000 recruitments have been done on merit basis, in a transparent manner, the Lt Governor said. Another major decision taken by the government is the one-time age relaxation in the recruitment exam for the post of sub- inspector, J&K Police, and the increase in the number of seats, he said. Sinha said the J&K administration is trying its best to strengthen the democratic system at the grassroots level; encouraging public participation in the development process and implementing principles of good governance. He said the government is creating more livelihood opportunities for the youth besides making all the public services easily accessible to the people of J&K.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jk-govt-has-tried-to-establish-new-transparent-accountable-people-centric-governance-lg/articleshow/87837617.cms||---

We too want to go back...after resolving the pending issues. If you want the same, then the government should immediately resume talks with the SKM on the six issues. Till then, the Morcha will continue this movement,” the SKM said in its email to the PM. The demands now include the removal of junior home minister Ajay Mishra, whose son Ashish Mishra is accused in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence. A discernible upping of ante, with the pointed reference to MSP and the addition of new demands, seems to indicate that road blocks at Delhi borders may not end with the repeal of the three new farm laws by Parliament soon after it meets on November 29. Enlisting six demands which include three fresh ones, SKM said, “You must be aware that the repeal of the three laws is not the only demand of this movement. From the very beginning of the talks with the government (last year), the Morcha had raised three additional demands.” However, during the failed meetings with government negotiators, the unions had made complete repeal of the three laws their core demand. Besides legal guarantee on MSP, the other demands include withdrawal of Electricity Amendment Bill, scrapping of provisions of fines for stubble burning in the Commission for Air Quality Management Law, withdrawal of cases against farmers registered during the protests in different states, sacking and arrest Mishra over the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, and compensation to kin of around 700 farmers who the unions claim died during the protests and allotment of a site at Singhu Border to set up a memorial. The last three demands in the list of six are new additions which, the SKM said, have arisen during the “historic movement in the last one year” and these too need to be resolved immediately. These demands will be taken up at ‘Kisan Mahapanchayat’ in Lucknow on Monday when the farmer leaders would explain their stance and pitch for action against Misha who belongs to UP. The forthcoming polls in UP seem an added trigger for holding the meeting in Lucknow. While welcoming PM’s announcement on Friday about the decision to repeal the farm laws, the SKM in its email to him said farmers now expect his government to “fulfil the promise at the earliest and in full”. Referring to the MSP issue, SKM has not only demanded a legal guarantee but also that it be decided on the C2+50% formula (comprehensive cost including imputed cost of capital and the rent on the farmers’ own land) instead of the current A2+FL (all paid-out cost incurred by farmers and the value of family labour) while arriving at the support price of 23 crops. The Morcha will meet again on November 27 — two days before the winter session of Parliament and their scheduled tractor march to Parliament House and take a call on the future course of action keeping in view of developments. Sources hinted at the possibility that the committee to consider issues like crop diversification and “strengthening” of MSP, as announced by Modi on Friday, could be discussed in Cabinet meeting on Wednesday. The mahapanchayat is expected to witness an impressive turnout of farmers from not only UP, but from other states as well, said Bhartiya Kisan Union state vice-president Harinam Singh Verma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/now-skm-mails-pm-modi-on-msp-five-other-pending-demands/articleshow/87837712.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||Delhi||Delhi pollution: Construction can resume, schools stay shut; truck entry ban extended||NEW DELHI: The ban on construction activities in the capital has been lifted effective Monday. Schools will, however, remain closed till further orders, while the ban on entry of trucks, except those carrying essential commodities, has been extended till November 26. The ban on construction and demolition activities, imposed by the Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas, came to an end on Sunday. However, the Delhi environment department issued fresh orders to control vehicular pollution. All offices of the Delhi government, autonomous bodies and corporations will remain closed till November 26, except those involved in essential and emergency services. However, all the employees will work from home. In its order, the environment department has advised all private offices to allow their staff to work from home. “The violation of the order issued under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, or the rules made there of, shall be punishable under Section 15 of the said Act, which includes imprisonment of up to five years or with fine may extend to Rs 1 lakh, or both,” the order stated. In a circular issued on Sunday, the Delhi government’s Directorate of Education said all schools will remain closed till further orders in view of the air quality situation. The circular, however, stated that online teaching and the examinations for Board classes would be conducted as per the guidelines issued earlier. Schools in Delhi for junior students had opened on November 1. However, students in private school returned only from November 8. A week into the move, the schools were shut again due to the rising pollution levels. Principals say such continuous disruptions will hamper the momentum of students returning to school after 19 months, since they first closed in March due to Covid. “Slowly, the parents were gaining confidence about sending their children (to schools). Now that has again been disrupted. The students' overall development will be affected," said Tania Joshi, principal, The Indian School.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-pollution-construction-can-resume-schools-stay-shut-truck-entry-ban-extended/articleshow/87837858.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||India||After please-all Rajasthan cabinet rejig, Pilot & Gehlot mend fences||JAIPUR: The Congress government in Rajasthan returned to its full strength of 30 on Sunday with a carefully orchestrated reshuffle that marked the return of two sacked ministers and seemed to have enough in terms of representation for former deputy CM Sachin Pilot to bury the hatchet with CM Ashok Gehlot after 16 months of wrangling. “Cabinet changes have guaranteed that Rajasthan’s Congress government will get repeated in 2023. BJP was predicting our government’s fall after the cabinet reshuffle, but the rejig has worked to strengthen us 25 times more,” Pilot said at a presser following the swearing-in of 15 ministers, 12 of them new faces. While there was speculation about whether Pilot had gained anything, he did appear to claw his way back into party’s circle of prominence. Sachin Pilot appeared to claw his way back into Congress’s circle of prominence, reflected in the party leadership giving in to his demand for “respectable representation to those who toiled to form the government in 2018”. He said the reshuffle was based on feedback from the Congress ranks in the state. He thanked CM Gehlot, AICC’s Rajasthan minder Ajay Maken and PCC chief Govind Singh Dotasra along with the central leadership for a “comprehensive, accurate and well-thought-out reshuffle” with increased Dalit and ST representation. On his own role in the party, Pilot said, “I am satisfied...Whatever responsibility Congress gave me in the past, I fulfilled it with total commitment. I shall do the same in future — whenever a role is assigned to me.” He claimed there were no “camps: in the state Congress". “We contested the 2018 poll collectively under the leadership of Sonia ji, Rahul ji and Priyanka Gandhi ji. The 2023 election, too, would be fought the sameway.” The 15 ministers to whom governor Kalraj Mishra administered the oath of office include Vishvendra Singh and Ramesh Meena, both of whom had been fired last year for siding with Pilot in his revolt against Gehlot. Four junior ministers were elevated to cabinet rank. Zahida Khan, the lone Muslim MLA among the new recruits, took oath in English, while the rest chose Hindi. Six-time MLA and former cabinet minister Hema $am Chaudhary , a Jat leader from western Rajasthan, was the first to be sworn in. He was among the 19 Congress MLAs who had revolted against Gehlot. None of the 13 independent MLAs who had supported the Congress government during the crisis last year was part of the reshuffle. Addressing a PCC event before the swearing-in, Gehlot said, “Contribution to governance of those who could not be inducted is no less than those who have been made ministers. As Sonia ji said once, their patience will be rewarded one day.” Late on Sunday, his office named six MLAs as advisers to the CM. They are Congress MLAs Jitendra Singh, Rajkumar Sharma and Danish Abrar and independent legislators Babu Lal Nagar, Sanyam Lodha and Ramkesh Meena.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-please-all-rajasthan-cabinet-rejig-pilot-gehlot-mend-fences/articleshow/87837923.cms||---

---||India||Some nations weakening law of sea: Rajnath Singh in China dig||NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh took aim at China, highlighting its blatant disregard for international laws, in comments during commissioning of new destroyer INS Visakhapatnam when he said, “It is a matter of concern that UNCLOS is being repeatedly weakened by arbitrary interpretation of its definition by some nations.”  This was a fairly clear reference to China, which has refused to abide by the 2016 verdict of the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling that China had no right to build military structures in the South China Sea. “The arbitrary interpretations create obstacles in the path of a rule-based maritime order,” Singh said. “There are some nations —I would like to say irresponsible nations — (who) for the sake of their narrow partisan interests, keep on giving new and inappropriate interpretations to these international laws from hegemonic tendencies,” he added. India, he reaffirmed, wants a rule-based Indo-Pacific, with freedom of navigation, free trade and universal values, in which interests of all participating countries are protected. It would therefore fall to the Indian Navy “to keep the Indo-Pacific open, safe and secure,” he said. India’s security and strategic interests, he said, are directly linked to the Indian Ocean, which is key to the global economy. Singh underscored the importance of rule-based freedom of navigation and security of sea lanes in the present era of globalisation to ensure stability, economic progress and development of the world. “Challenges such as piracy, terrorism, illegal smuggling of arms and narcotics, human trafficking, illegal fishing and damage to the environment are equally responsible for affecting the maritime domain. Therefore, the role of the Indian Navy becomes very important in the entire Indo-Pacific region,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/some-nations-weakening-law-of-sea-rajnath-singh-in-china-dig/articleshow/87838052.cms||---

When she protested, she said her mother told her to “leave that crown in the garage.”Also, very often, success is judged by the end results or the monetary value gained, and not by the effort put in. Tanushree Jain, founder of Nushaura, a brand for eco-friendly products, said she came from a family where her mother was a teacher and her father had retired from the Railways, and nobody had ever done business. After completing her education, she was earning a stable salary and everyone around her was happy. “But, the day I went to my parents with my business ideas, they got scared and I was suddenly facing a lot of questions,” she said.

It will accommodate 500 two-wheelers and over 550 four-wheelers. Work on the Rs 78-crore project began in 2015. It was to be ready by 2017 but ran into delays. Among the reasons for the delay were lack of permission to carry out blasting on the rocky terrain and frequent occupation of the venue as a protest site. Then there was the pandemic followed by lockdown that saw migrant workers heading back home. “The biggest challenge was a series of protests at Freedom Park. They draw a minimum of over 1,000 people, and carrying out work then is not a safe proposition,” said a senior BBMP site engineer. During 2018-19, there were over 20 protests at Freedom Park. In addition to this, the high court said the structure should have ground minus four basement floors, pushing BBMP to change the design. “Given that Freedom Park is a known protest site, if we construct any building above the ground level, there is a chance of protesters using it to harm themselves. So the design was changed and this took nearly six months of planning,” said BS Prahallad, chief engineer (major projects), BBMP. When the civic body started excavating the site, it ran into rocky terrain 10 feet under. The mines and geology department was roped in for expertise, and handling the rocky terrain took another two years. “There was a delay in allotment of rock disposal and royalty charges of the mining and geology department,” an official said. Another official said the project could have been completed earlier if blasting was permitted and there were fewer protests at the venue. “It is a paid parking system and pricing will be similar to the ones in malls. The tariff is not fixed yet,” said Prahallad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/freedom-park-set-to-get-multi-level-car-parking-in-jan/articleshow/87838079.cms||Nithya Mandyam

The insurer pointed out that he failed to get the policy transferred to his name, and a Bengaluru consumer court upheld its reasoning. The man’s wife and son had approached a consumer court with a complaint against the insurance firm. The court recently dismissed it, saying the vehicle was insured in the name of its first owner at the time of the accident and the bereaved family is not entitled to make any claims under the Consumer Protection Act. Arun M Shenoy, a resident of Banashankari II Stage, had purchased a Yamaha RX 100 bike from Mohammed Harshad on November 23, 2018. He got the ownership transferred to his name and was planning to transfer the insurance policy (valid till October 31, 2019 in Mohammed’s name) within the mandated period of 14 days. Unfortunately, Arun was killed in an accident on November 30, 2018. His wife Rekha Shenoy applied to National Insurance Company Limited for a claim as Mohammed had an active insurance policy on the RX 100 bike and paid a premium of Rs 1,470. But on November 11, 2019, the insurer repudiated the claim. The woman and her son approached Bengaluru Urban 2nd additional district consumer disputes redressal commission in Shantinagar with a complaint against National Insurance Company Limited. The lawyer for the complainants stated that as per the Motor Vehicles Act, Arun’s family is eligible for the insurance claim as the motorcycle was registered in his name and he was scheduled to change the name in the insurance policy too within two weeks of purchase but passed away seven days after the sale. The insurance firm’s attorney argued that the policy was in the name of first owner Mohammed at the time of the accident and there was no connection between Arun and the insurer whatsoever. Therefore, the need to pay the claim money to the deceased person’s family doesn’t arise, he added. No contract between deceased, insurer: JudgesIn their verdict pronounced on October 21, 2021, judges of the consumer forum noted that there was indeed no contract between Arun and National Insurance Company Limited and the victim didn’t pay any premium to the firm. Therefore, he can’t be considered a customer here. He may have rights for a claim under the Motor Vehicles Act but not under the Consumer Protection Act. The judges added there was no deficiency of service on the part of the opposite party, and the victim’s family can make a claim only before the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, dismissing the complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/biker-dies-before-transfer-of-policy-court-upholds-insurance-claim-denial/articleshow/87838080.cms||Petlee Peter

---||Bengaluru||Residents upset as sewage enters rejuvenated Doddakallasandra Lake||BENGALURU: Sewage is flowing into Doddakallasandra Lake which had been taken up for rejuvenation only in July last year, locals say, adding they fear the water body’s rich biodiversity could be a casualty of this. The lake spread over 20 acres is located off Kanakapura Road. Raghavendra B who lives nearby said, “If there is constant inflow of sewage, macrophytes will start growing over the surface and excessive algae underwater due to high nutrition levels. This will lead to a dip in oxygen levels in the water, causing the aquatic plants and animals to suffocate. If there are no fish, no migratory birds will come here, thus killing the natural ecosystem of the lake.” The rejuvenation work was taken up by BBMP in July last year and entry of sewage had been stopped. But part of the work still seems incomplete, residents from the neighbourhood said, adding that from Friday, sewage has been entering the lake again. “Doddakallasandra Lake has a rich biodiversity. An NGO’s biodiversity report had said it hosts 71 varieties of birds and 37 butterfly species and is home to 42 tree and 43 plant species. Over the past few months, the lake witnessed the arrival of birds,” Raghavendra said. Sewage is entering the waterbody not only through the wetland but also other sources, including a a huge residential apartment complex and three diversion drains from nearby villages, the residents said. They said that they expect Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) and Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to be responsive to their complaints and take action immediately before it affects the lake ecosystem. KV Manjunath Reddy, president of Narayananagar Residents Welfare Association, said, “After TOI highlighted the sorry state of Doddakallasandra Lake in 2019, it was taken up for rejuvenation in 2020. We were informed it was revived at a cost of Rs 4.5 crore, but the issue of sewage entering it persists. It is a total waste of time, money and labour.” The RWA had requested BBMP to install an STP at the time of rejuvenation. “They initially said they would consider it but that didn’t happen,” Reddy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/residents-upset-as-sewage-entersrejuvenated-doddakallasandra-lake/articleshow/87838082.cms||Mrinalini Bhat

---||Bengaluru||Post PIL in HC, Karnataka govt puts brakes on dealer point registration of vehicles||BENGALURU: The government’s plan to implement dealer point registration (DPR) of vehicles appears to have run into rough weather. Under DPR, registration of non-transport vehicles with fully built body from manufacturers can be done at the dealer level itself. This was expected to reduce time taken for registration of vehicles, corruption, paperwork and work load. As part of the system, dealers will upload all documents (relevant forms, insurance etc.) on the Parivahan portal once a customer selects a new vehicle and makes the payment at the showroom. A receipt with registration number will be generated online once the tax is paid and a high security registration plate (HSRP) will be fixed in an hour. This means a customer who visits an automobile showroom could return home with the vehicle the same day. While chief minister Basavaraj Bommai launched DPR on November 1, only one dealer in the state (in Yeshwantpur) received the authority to register vehicles. The earlier plan was to have a pilot of 10 dealer points across Karnataka. But transport department officials said they suspended DPR after a PILwas filed in the high court against it. The PIL was filed by Mohammed Dastagir, an advocate from Mysuru who worked in the transport department’s legal cell before his retirement in 2014. Dastagir claimed in the PIL: “Giving the power of registration to a dealer’s employee will have far-reaching effects. All other subsequent actions, including insuring the vehicle, depend on the entries made on the certificate of registration. Any wrong entry, intentional or unintentional, can result in denial of insurance claim and ownership claim.” Waseem Memon of Drive Without Borders, an NGO, said: “There is a dealer-RTO nexus in the state. Many dealers are illegally collecting ‘handling charges/RTO charges’ from customers to pay bribes to transport officials.” States like Maharashtra, Kerala, Gujarat, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Assam have already rolled out DPR. The Union ministry of road transport and highways has instructed all states to implement it. MP Shyam, president of the Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (Karnataka chapter), said: “Under the Motor Vehicles Act, Karnataka has to implement dealer point registration. In fact, most states have already launched it. This will offer a seamless experience to customers, but there are some issues with bank guarantee and digital signature which are expected to be resolved soon.” K Radhakrishna Holla, president, Karnataka State Travel Operators’ Association, said: “MV Act as well as MORTH order mandate all states to implement DPR. There is no reason to delay its implementation in the state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/post-pil-in-hc-govt-puts-brakes-on-dealer-point-registration-of-vehicles/articleshow/87838084.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

Justice Shivashankar Amarannavar said the chargesheet material reveals though Yusuf (accused no. 6) is in prison, he called the other accused from a mobile and conspired to kill Irfan. Raju Nepali (accused no. 14) at the instance of Yusuf transferred money collected from the other accused so as to hire four sharpshooters from Mumbai. “The petitioner (Raju Nepali) has contact with the sharpshooters residing in Mumbai. If they are granted bail, there is threat to the complainant and other prosecution witness. There is a prima facie case against the petitioners for the offence alleged against them. There are no grounds to grant bail,” the judge stated. Irfan was murdered in Hubballi on August 6, 2020 by six assailants. Two of them shot him in the head using their pistols. At that time, Irfan was standing in front of a hotel along with friends, after attending a marriage reception. Yusuf is accused of hatching conspiracy to kill Irfan as the latter refused to heed his Rs 25 lakh demand. The demand was made after Yusuf was told that Irfan was collecting hafta in his name. Irfan not only refused to pay Yusuf but also ridiculed him. The duo approached the high court after the sessions court in Hubballi rejected bail on July 7, 2021. Yusuf claimed that at the time of Irfan’s murder, he was in Mysuru prison serving life sentence and hence, there was no question of him contacting anybody over phone. Raju Nepali claimed he was not at the spot at the time of incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/murder-case-no-bail-for-2-with-links-to-underworld/articleshow/87838085.cms||Vasantha Kumar
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Sludge from drains turns road near Krishna Rao Park into muck zone||BENGALURU: Clearing clogged shoulder-drains is something every locality would normally welcome. But residents of Dr Omar Sharif Road, off Krishna Rao Park in Basavanagudi, are cursing BBMP from the day shoulder drains on the street were desilted. Reason: Heaps of sludge left behind by workers on the road are only drawing more garbage, turning the stretch into a black spot. Mansoor Ali, who resides on this road, said, “Civic workers have junked heaps of debris and sludge on the street. Now, people assume that it is a place to throw garbage and over the past few weeks, it has slowly turned into a black spot. This has led to breeding of not just mosquitoes, but also rodents. We really don’t know whom to take this up with. The main reason they have left the debris behind is because there is a vacant plot nearby and BBMP knows no one will ever make it an issue. But the pileup has started troubling people like us who live across the street.” There is a school opposite this black spot and children are using the road every day. Mansoor added: “Auto and cab drivers are using this place as a public toilet. With a school right opposite, the Palike should take the issue a little more seriously.” The work on clearing shoulder drains started close to six months ago. With October and November receiving heavy rain so far, the sludge never dries up, instead, gets pushed around all over the street, leaving the entire stretch stinking. Dayan Ali Khan, whose house is next to the black spot, said, “There are at least three truckloads of sludge and debris on the road. When we asked our regular garbage collector to help us, he refused. We really need help; BBMP shouldn’t have left it like this in the first place.” ‘Can’t remove it while wet’“As far as I know, the debris has not been lying around for that long. But we can’t have the sludge removed while it’s wet; we have to wait for it to dry. The executive engineer in-charge is unwell.

Researchers, however, caution that further testing and validation on a larger scale is necessary before this can be taken from the lab to the clinic.The team — comprising researchers from IISc’s Centre for BioSystems Science and Engineering, the Mazumdar Shaw Centre for Translational Research and the Mazumdar Shaw Medical Foundation — analysed tumour and blood samples from individuals with gliomas (tumours that occur in the brain) to identify surface proteins on immune cells in the blood whose levels were closely linked to tumour progression.In the study that has been published in OncoImmunology, researchers pointed out that late-stage gliomas such as grade three and grade four gliomas are associated with a poor prognosis — the tumour is harder to treat and the patient is likely to have a low chance of survival.“Our pilot study suggests that we can potentially use two blood-based biomarkers present on immune cells to identify patients who might not perform well with particular treatment strategies,” Siddharth Jhunjhunwala, assistant professor, BSSE, and senior author of the study says.Such a blood-based testing methodology, researchers said, could help clinicians better understand disease progression and choose a more effective treatment regimen.Pointing out that conventional cancer treatments like chemotherapy are often ineffective in treating these tumours, they said it has prompted a shift to newer techniques like immunotherapy, which involves provoking our own immune system to attack the tumour cells.However, attempts to use some of the standard immunotherapies to treat gliomas have met with limited success, Jhunjhunwala explains, adding: “This led to a specific scientific gap that we were trying to address, which is to understand the immune profile in the tumour microenvironment.”The team collected blood and tumour samples from patients with grade three and grade four gliomas, and compared the numbers of specific immune cells called monocytes and neutrophils in these samples.“Because these are biosamples, they need to be preserved and processed very well without loss of cell viability. We had to split up methodology between two institutes — here and at the lab at the Mazumdar Shaw Foundation. They would do all the processing and fixation to retain the viability of the cells, and then we would do the characterisation and immunostaining here,” explains Jayashree V Raghavan, PhD student at BSSE and first author of the study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/researchers-identify-blood-based-biomarkers-for-brain-tumours/articleshow/87838087.cms||---

Police identified the accused as Sonia and her former employer as Keshav (name changed), both residents of Ramamurthynagar, east Bengaluru. According to police, Sonia worked at Keshav’s residence for six years and left the job last year during the first Covid-19 lockdown. She approached Keshav in July this year and asked him to give her another chance. But he declined as he had already recruited another domestic help by that time. “In August, she sent me a few indecent photographs of mine. I was under medication and have been using sleeping tablets since 2016. She might have taken my photographs while I was sleeping. She threatened to upload them on social media and demanded money if I didn’t want her to do so,” Keshav alleged in his complaint. Police said Sonia had taken photographs while Keshav was on the bed and also some of his half-naked body. Initially, Keshav gave her Rs 1.2 lakh. She then demanded Rs 15 lakh to delete those photos. “She asked me to give her Rs 5 lakh immediately and Rs 10 lakh after 20 days. I had no money and was unable to bear the mental torture,” Keshav told police. Police registered a case against Sonia under IPC sections 384 (extortion) and 420 (cheating) on Sunday based on a complaint by Keshav. She was arrested on November 16. “She confessed she had taken photographs of Keshav when he went for a bath and came out of the washroom. She also took photos from his bedroom,” a police officer said. Police seized her mobile and found indecent photos of Keshav. She was produced before the court, which remanded her in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/help-extorts-1-2l-from-ex-employer/articleshow/87838090.cms||Santosh kumar.B

Over a span of one week prior to the conjunction, analysis by both Isro and JPL/Nasa consistently showed that the radial separation between the spacecraft would be less than 100 m and the closest approach distance would be only about 3 km at the aforementioned time of closest approach,” an Isro statement said.“The manoeuvre was scheduled on October 18, 2021. It was designed to ensure a sufficiently large radial separation at the next closest conjunction between the spacecraft. The CAM was executed nominally at 8.22pm (IST). After orbit determination with post-manoeuvre tracking data, it was reconfirmed that there would be no further close conjunctions with LRO in the near future with the achieved orbit,” Isro said.Chandrayaan-2 and LRO orbit Moon in a nearly polar orbit and hence, both the spacecraft come close to each other over the Lunar poles. “...It is common for satellites in Earth orbit to undergo CAMs to mitigate collision risk due to space objects, including space debris and operational spacecraft. Isro monitors such critical close approaches and execute CAMs for its operational satellites whenever risk is assessed to be critical,” Isro said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/isro-prevents-collisionof-chandrayaan-2-with-nasas-lunar-orbiter/articleshow/87838091.cms||---

No one, however, was arrested on Sunday as the hotel authorities became strict while dealing with their customers in view of massive raids by police in the last two days. Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal will hold a meeting with authorities of different hotels on Monday and ask them to take undertaking from visitors that they will not consume liquor during their stay at the hotels. Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma said the police were leaving no stone unturned to ensure strict implementation of liquor prohibition in the city. Six software engineers were arrested from Hotel Fortune in Kanakarbagh and two doctors (a male and a female) from a room at Hotel Ginger under Kotwali police station area in the city with liquor bottles on Saturday. Meanwhile, police have booked owner of Hotel Fortune and its manager for consumption of liquor by guests. However, in the Hotel Ginger case, only its manager was made named accused. Hotel Ginger is owned by a multinational group based in Jharkhand. SHO of Kankarbagh police station Ravishankar Kumar said senior authorities would decide the course of action to be taken against the owners and managers of the hotels against whom FIRs have been lodged. SHO of Kotwali police station Sunil Kumar Singh said since Hotel Ginger is owned by a business group, its manager was booked. The SSP said police would continue to raid hotels in the city to enforce prohibition at least till the conclusion of marriage season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/violation-of-prohibition-40-arrested-from-different-hotels-in-patna-in-two-days/articleshow/87836094.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The stove on her kitchen slab was a few inches higher than the level of her wheelchair’s armrest. The man who fixed this problem for her is Bhargav Sundaram, the 55-year-old founder of Callidai Motor Works, a company that, for the past 23 years, has been developing breakthrough solutions for people with disabilities. Callidai made the woman a battery-operated, motorised wheelchair that could lift her to the level of the stove. Callidai works out of a small manufacturing facility nestled between idyllic paddy fields and mango groves in the village of Vaniamallee in Gummidipoondi, with a team of 35 – a majority of them disabled. It churns out products for about 30,000 people with different forms of disabilities. Callidai’s USP lies in the customisation that goes into every product – a lift with a bridge attached for a senior with Parkinson’s to enter his home; a wheelchair lift with a ramp to help old or disabled passengers into vans; a hydrotherapy pool lift for patients with spinal cord injuries. "The possibilities are endless," says Sundaram. Callidai has supplied the indigenous wheelchair lift for vehicles with customised floor height to 250 users across India. Other wheelchairs include a front-wheel- drive variant for roads and rough surfaces which can move at 8kmph and cover 15km at a stretch. This is useful for those who may want to drop by their neighbourhood store or park. The latest is an android-operated, Bluetooth-enabled trolley armed with a fish-eye camera, speaker and cell phone holder, which can be used to take food and medicines for patients in quarantine. Grandson of K R Sundaram Iyer – the man behind the iconic Enfield India – Bhargav started Callidai in 1998, chasing his love for automobiles. He launched an electric bicycle that sold at half the cost of a moped. Bhargav’s employees, who come to work on hand-pedalled tricycles, suggested they use the same mechanism to power wheelchairs. "I was instantly sold on that idea," he says. Since then, he, along with his wife Priya Bhargav, has developed 40 models of powered wheelchairs. A little over 2% of the Indian population are disabled. A 2020 report by the World Bank says every year accidents leave around 7.5 lakh maimed for life. Callidai’s wheelchairs cost `6,000 to `2.5 lakh apiece, and the price of wheelchair lifts starts at Rs1.9 lakh. "The market for mobility solutions for the disabled is huge, but those who need them and can also afford them are miniscule," he says. Bhargav runs the Wheelchair Trust of India, a charitable body under which he gives away 150 powered wheelchairs at about 20% of the cost every year. In collaborative attempts with the government to realize its Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan, (Accessible India Campaign), Callidai Motor Works has created a wheelchair lift for buses. It has installed lifting devices at ten railway stations between Chennai and Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/making-machines-to-give-disabled-a-dignified-life/articleshow/87836070.cms||Saranya Chakrapani
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Farmers’ hopes sink as crops worth Rs 3,000 crores go under water||AMARAVATI: Heavy rains and flash floods have caused massive destruction in Chittoor, Kadapa, Anantapur and Nellore districts, destroying crops worth over Rs 3,000 crore. The actual loss, however, is likely to be even higher by the time the district administrations take up the field level enumeration. Officials are also worried that crop damage could be very high as the chances of survival of the standing crop looks remote. Normally, crops recover from the damage caused by heavy rains in a few days.  However, flash floods and a continuous downpour for nearly four days have left little chance for the crops to survive. In fact, green fields over thousands of acres are under water and there is no trace of the crop at many places. Farmers in the four Rayalaseema districts had pinned their hopes on a high yield this season as the region witnessed heavy rainfall after a gap of several decades. The monsoon this year saw constant inflows from the canals to the farm fields throughout the season. According to initial reports, crops on over 10 lakh acres have been damaged due to heavy rains and floods in Chittoor, Kadapa, Anantapur and Nellore districts. Crops in Kadapa and Nellore districts, in particular, have witnessed huge damage following the incessant rains over the last four days. Sources said crops on about five lakh acres have been completely damaged in Kadapa district. Breaches of major bunds of the Annamayya project and Cheyyer reservoirs have washed away the crops in over 25 villages. Paddy, sunflower, black gram and cotton crops have been damaged beyond recovery. “We will take all possible measures to bail out the farmers from this crisis. We will extend crop loss for each and every acre in the district,” said chief whip Gadikota Srikanth Reddy. He reviewed the situation with officials of the agriculture department and directed them to take care during the enumeration of crop loss. Srikanth Reddy also asked the officials to store water in the reservoirs to the extent possible as it would be an opportunity to provide water to the farmers for the next crop. Paddy fields in about three lakh acres have suffered massive damage in Nellore district. High inflows to the Somasila and Kandaleru reservoirs from the Penna river have resulted in heavy floods, resulting in damage on an unprecedented scale. More than 32 villages in Buchireddypalem mandal alone have witnessed substantial damage.  The Penna river bank has been breached at several places, causing flood waters to enter villages. Penuballi, Kagulapadu, Damaramadugu, RR Colony, Sri Rangarajapuram, Chellaipalem, Kovuru, Gangavaram, Padugupadu and Paturu villages have been cut off by flood water from the Penna river. Horticulture crops on over one lakh acres were also damaged in Kadapa and Anantapur districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/farmers-hopes-sink-as-crops-worth-crores-go-under-water/articleshow/87836519.cms||Samdani MN
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Rain throws out of gear paddy harvest in Krishna district||VIJAYAWADA: Incessant rains have not spared farmers in Krishna district. Farmers who are about to harvest the kharif crop are now fearing crop damage following continuous rainfall over the last four days. Farmers in the district have sown paddy on an extent of around 2.5 lakh hectares for kharif this year.  Around 10 per cent of farmers harvested the crop after officials issued a cyclone alert. But the vast majority of farmers are yet to harvest their crop even as continuous rains battered Kaikaluru, Mudinepalli, Nagayalanka, Avanigadda, Gudivada and Vijayawada rural mandals. Similar to their Rayalaseema counterparts, farmers in Krishna district who were eyeing a bumper crop and substantial profits this year, are now faced with the prospect of crop loss. As per preliminary estimates, crops on around 4,800 acres have been damaged by the rains. “We were about to harvest the crop in the next ten days. But the rain has ruined our hopes. Rain water has stagnated in the fields and it will not be possible to harvest the crop now,” said M Rammohan, a farmer from Kalidhindi. Many farmers, however, have started harvesting the crop despite the flood water, hoping to avoid further damage. “We usually harvest crops after 108 days as it will give us a high price. But we have decided to harvest paddy early this year though moisture levels in the grain are very high. It is better to get a low price than to lose the crop altogether,” said Damodar Babu, a farmer from Kankipadu. Authorities of the agriculture department have started estimating the losses from crop damage. Officials have assured that every flood-affected farmer will get the insurance amount for the damaged crop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/rain-throws-out-of-gear-paddy-harvest-in-krishna/articleshow/87836528.cms||Venu Lanka

The CM, who took stock of the flood situation and relief operations with CMO officials on Sunday, said ministers and MLAs from these areas need not attend the ongoing assembly session. Upon learning that the flood situation is still grim, the chief minister asked ministers and legislators to visit all villages in their respective constituencies and extend support to the people. Jagan also asked legislators to ensure public representatives of local bodies swing into action and provide relief to flood victims. Public representatives should coordinate with field level officials and take appropriate measures till the situation in these areas eases, the chief minister directed. Meanwhile, the chief minister has decided to grant special ration to all people from flood-hit areas free of cost. The chief minister asked collectors to ensure that each flood victim receives the emergency ration sanctioned over and above the norms fixed by the State Disaster Relief Force and National Disaster Management Act. Following the CM’s decision, principal secretary (revenue and disaster management) V Usharani directed the district collectors to distribute 25kg rice, one kg red gram dal, one-litre palmolein, one kg onion and one kg potato per family in all flood and rain-hit areas in Chittoor, Kadapa, Nellore and Anantapur districts.

The faction's national spokesperson, Shrawan Kumar Agrawal, said preparations for the foundation day celebrations were in full swing at the state level as well as the panchayat level to make it a grand success. The workers and functionaries of the RLJP and Dalit Sena would distribute study material among the children from the Dalit community and the poor on the occasion. The villages and hamlets were being identified for the purpose, he added. “The idea is to educate the members of Dalit community and propagate the ideology of the party’s founder late Ram Vilas Paswan. The people will be apprised of late Paswan’s five-decade-long political career and his major contributions,” the spokesperson said. State chief of RLJP and Samastipur MP Prince Raj has asked the workers of the party to organise functions in their respective areas to recall the contributions of the departed leader. “This will be the first occasion when foundation day will be observed in his (Ram Vilas’s) absence,” Agrawal said. On the other hand, the state parliamentary board of Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) has authorised the faction’s national chief and Jamui MP Chirag Paswan to take a final decision on the tie-up with any political group in next elections. A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting of the parliamentary board headed by its chairperson Hulas Pandey at S K Puri office here on Friday. State chief of LJP (Ram Vilas) Raju Tiwari was also present at the meeting. Earlier, Chirag had said his party would contest the next elections in the state in alliance. The development came in the wake of party’s drubbings in the recently held by-election to Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly seats. Sources in LJP (Ram Vilas) said the RJD has offered six-seven seats to the Chirag-led faction in the upcoming state legislative council elections for 24 seats. However, any decision on the tie up will be taken by Chirag.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/paras-rljp-gears-up-for-foundation-day-celebrations/articleshow/87836428.cms||Ramashankar

This had caused severe waterlogging in the township this time,” said Sameer Sharma, a resident of DLF Heights New Town. “We are the worst sufferers. The boundary wall of our complex has been damaged due to this encroachment. This trend of encroaching on pavements appears to be increasing,” said Debashis Basu, a resident of Animikha housing complex. The New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) has set up 800 rehabilitation stalls and had started taking applications from hawkers who want to be shifted to the new sites. But the process has been put on hold following objections from the local hawker unions asking why those who had previously handed over their land to Hidco will not be accommodated. NKDA had come up with a rule that only the existing hawkers can apply for rehabilitation to the stalls. “We are discussing the matter to find out how a policy on this can be framed,” said an NKDA official. The authorities are working on a plan to set up a G+1 building for hawkers and street vendors to conduct business in a systematic way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hawker-encroachment-still-a-menace-in-new-town/articleshow/87836867.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Patna||Bihar rural polls: Cash, liquor being offered to electorate||PATNA: Organising a feast to woo the electorate is now a passé. Cash, liquor and hand pumps are now being offered by the candidates to influence the voters in the ongoing panchayat election in the state. For instance, a district board member nominee from Ramgarh in Kaimur district, Rinki Kushwaha, and her two supporters were booked for allegedly luring voters by offering them money and liquor. The police seized 12 cartons of liquor, Rs 50,000 in cash and pamphlets from an election campaign vehicle belonging to Kushwaha from Ramgrah police station area late on Saturday. Two persons – Suchit Singh and Nitish Kumar – were also arrested. Mohania sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Faiz Ahmad Khan said raids were on to arrest the candidate on the basis of revelation made by her two supporters before the investigating officers. “Money and liquor were meant to be distributed among people for election purpose,” he said. The SDPO added a police team led by SHO Ram Kalyan Singh intercepted a car near Ahiwas village while returning from a raid against liquor smugglers at Pakauli village in the district. The search at Pakauli village led to the arrest of one Bhuwar Yadav. The police recovered 12 cartons of country liquor and Rs 50,000 in cash from the car. Election pamphlets were also seized from the car being used for campaign. The SHO said an FIR related to violation of model code of conduct and prohibition law was lodged against the candidate and her two supporters. Further investigation is underway, he said. Earlier, the Buxar police had seized a mini truck carrying hand pumps to be supplied to the electorate of Parari panchayat under Simri police station area on Friday. The consignment was allegedly booked by sitting mukhiya Urmila Devi’s husband Saroj Tiwari for election purposes. The vehicle and the hand pumps were confiscated by the police on the directive of senior officials. The police swung into action after some residents complained that hand pumps and iron pipes have been transported in a vehicle from Ara. The vehicle was parked on the campus of the panchayat bhawan. Dumraon sub-divisional officer Kumar Pankaj and sub-divisional police officer Shree Raj confirmed the seizure of the hand pumps and a goods carrier. “Further investigation is underway,” the SDPO said. An investigating officer said some residents revealed to the police that the hand pumps were to be supplied to the residents of Parari panchayat ahead of the panchayat election.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rural-polls-cash-liquor-being-offered-to-electorate/articleshow/87836241.cms||Ramashankar

It has left many youngsters severely depressed and may have prompted some to take their own lives, say experts. Since Thursday, four youngsters in Bengal have died by suicide following arguments with their parents over cellphone use. While many parents believe it’s time to switch off gadgets now that schools have opened, it could lead to severe withdrawal symptoms and needs to be done gradually, advised psychiatrists. ‘Problematic internet addiction’ or ‘screen addiction’ is no different from addiction to smoking or alcohol, according to psychiatrist Praveen Kumar. Children and adolescents, who have so far been using cellphones or laptops for academic purposes, can’t be expected to let go of them overnight. It could lead to a strong, adverse reaction that could even be fatal, Kumar said. “Parents need to realize that gadget-dependence doesn’t go in a day. Children must be weaned off in a phased manner. Restricting the time for using gadgets is a good way to begin,” said Kumar. This addiction is referred to as ‘digital heroin’ in the West. A large number of Kolkata’s adolescents are believed to be hooked on gadgets and are in need of assistance to go off them, said Hrishikesh Kumar, head of the department of neurology, Institute of Neurosciences Kolkata (INK). “Both heroin and gadgets generate a series of chemical reactions. In due course, the frontal lobe gets used to the stimulation and starts demanding it more frequently. The habit then starts getting translated into an addiction. Gadget-dependence, like addiction to substances, can alter the neuro-chemical balance of the frontal lobe and make you a different person,” he said. “Parents themselves are glued to cellphones most of the time. Yet, they expect their kids to stay off them or give them up overnight. Parents should focus on lowering their own addiction, interact with children more and create an environment that will help youngsters stay away from gadgets. Having said that, it has to be a practical move for we are all dependent on gadgets,” said consultant psychiatrist J Ram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/experts-ask-parents-to-mix-firmness-with-softness-after-4-cellphone-tragedies-in-3-days/articleshow/87836854.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

The admissions will start with Magadh Mahila College (MMC) followed by other colleges of the university. PU students’ welfare dean Anil Kumar said some seats in different honours subjects had remained vacant in several colleges in course of the regular online admission conducted by the university last month. Moreover, the state government had also sanctioned about 240 additional seats (180 in Patna College and 60 in Patna Science College) recently. Hence, a decision to reopen the admission portal of different colleges for fresh admission against the available seats in different honours subjects was taken by the university in the larger interest of students. All the admissions against the vacant seats in different colleges would be completed by November 30 as the classes of these batches have already started. Meanwhile, the submission of application forms for admission to the conventional postgraduate courses in PU is also commencing on Monday. The last date for the receipt of forms is December 30. The last date for submission of application forms for admission to the self-financing PG courses and LL B course of PU has been extended till November 30. As the things stand, admission of students to the PG courses of PU in the academic session (2021-22) are unlikely to be completed before the end of January next year and classes would commence only after that. In all likelihood, the session will be late by more than six months. And, this was caused mainly by the delay in the conduct of undergraduate examinations and publication of results due to the closure of institutions during Covid-induced lockdowns, said the dean.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/last-round-of-ug-admissions-in-patna-university-from-today/articleshow/87836078.cms||B K Mishra

The victim, a resident of Khar (west), filed a case at the Khar police station on November 17 after repeated calls from the woman for more than a week. The former principal, who had retired in 2002, used social media to keep in touch with students and to post stories related to arts. On November 10, the woman sent him a friend request on Facebook, but he did not accept as he didn’t know her. In his complaint, the senior citizen said, “The woman sent a message saying she is employed in a beauty parlour and wanted to talk to me. But I did not accept her friend’s request.” She then posted her contact number on his page and said she wanted to talk urgently. “Thinking it important, the victim shared his number too. The next two days, the woman kept sending messages to him, but he did not reply,” said an officer from Khar police. On November 12, he got a WhatsApp video call and found the woman posing naked. “He immediately disconnected the call. Two days later, she insisted that he transfer Rs 249 for her mobile recharge,” said the police. The woman repeated this two to three times, before claiming that she had recorded him enjoying her naked video calls. She threatened to share the video with his wife and children and file a false case of rape against him if he disconnected her calls, said cops. “We are getting the help of the cyber cell in tracking the internet protocol (IP) address of the woman who threatened him and tried to extort money after repeatedly stalking him on social media,” said an officer from Khar police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-woman-stalks-ex-principal-online-threatens-rape-case/articleshow/87837755.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Vijayawada||In Rajampet, flood-hit villagers return to damaged homes||Kadapa: Flash floods have left a trail of destruction in many villages in Kadapa district. In Rajampet region, the floods caused massive damage within no time. The villages that flourished with green crops along the Cheyyeru river till last week have been turned into rubble. The riverbanks were breached following the massive flood to the Cheyyeru, a tributary of Penna, razing down hundreds of houses in the villages. Many affluent families were also seen waiting for food distributed by the authorities. “It was a horrific night when we ran away from the village after seeing the river enter the village. About 20 people from my village are still missing,” said G Sambaiah, a youth from Pulaputtur village. He said survivors from the village are searching for their kin. Twenty-four villages along Cheyyeru bore the brunt of the flash flood. “It is pathetic that field level officials have not visited the villages yet. The state government should immediately grant Rs 10,000 compensation to each family in the flood-hit areas as the damage was so huge,” said V Srinivasa Rao, central committee member, CPI(M). Locals alleged that officials have failed to put the riverbank villages on high alert from the risk of floods breaching the banks and inundating residential areas. “We could have at least saved our villages had the officials alerted us about the quantum of flood at least after witnessing breaches to Annamayya and Pincha projects,” said Narasimha Reddy in Gundlur village. Many broke down after seeing their houses ravaged in the floods when they returned home on Sunday. Thousands from Mandapalli, Pulaputtur, Gundlur and Choppavaripalle have lost not only their household goods but also jewelry, land documents and certificates. Rajampet legislator Meda Mallikharjuna Reddy visited the villages and extended his support to the victims. He was seen coordinating with officials to provide food and shelter to the flood victims in nearby areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/in-rajampet-flood-hit-villagers-return-to-damaged-homes/articleshow/87836550.cms||Samdani MN

All parish churches of the Orthodox Church have now asked the government to dismiss the recommendations made by the Justice KT Thomas-headed commission. The church passed a resolution which was read in all parish churches under the denomination on Sunday. The resolution asked the government that the recommendation which was “one-sided, and illegal and aimed at sabotaging the Supreme Court verdict” should be dismissed without even being considered. Malankara association secretary Biju Oommen said that the move to make a law against the Supreme Court verdict will only worsen the situation. The points included in the recommendations are only the stand of Thomas, which was in favour of the Jacobite church, he said. It is highly objectionable that the law reforms commission is trying to favour a group which is challenging the decision of the apex court. The review petition and the clarification petition filed by the Jacobite church against the Supreme Court verdict of 2017 was dismissed by the Supreme Court in 2019 and 2020. The verdict also says that no efforts should be made to bypass the verdict through any law, said the Orthodox Church. The Orthodox church said that the recommendation that the right over a church can be decided through the majority of the respective parishes is unconstitutional as SC said that Malankara church is a trust and the churches under it are its units. Oommen said that the Orthodox Church believes that the government will not implement this draft bill.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/orthodox-faction-denounces-draft-law-on-church-ownership/articleshow/87836924.cms||---

India’s premier bourse has already seen the count of its registered users (based on unique client codes) from Gujarat jump to 99 lakh as of November 21, which is the second highest registered accounts on BSE after Maharashtra, shows the data compiled by the exchange. Going by the addition of around 2.42 lakh new users over the previous month, the state’s tally of registered investors with BSE will soon achieve the milestone of one crore. These investors include all types of investors, be it individual or institutional or those investing through mutual funds. “We, as a nation, are currently observing a significant growth in the number of equity investors across the country. With Gujarat alone contributing close to 1 crore registered investor accounts out of the total 8.69 crore accounts on BSE, it is a further testament to our efforts in promoting investment behaviour and initiatives that include e-enabling customers with a less-paper ecosystem and on-boarding through an easy and hassle-free digital process,” said Ashishkumar Chauhan, MD and CEO, BSE. The equity market rally after the initial debacle following the outbreak of the pandemic has lured many individuals to jump on the equity investment bandwagon. With a growth of 31%, Gujarat has so far added 23.58 lakh investor accounts over the previous year, the BSE data further reveals. Gujarat currently has a share of 11% in total investors accounts on BSE. “As people cut down on non-essential expenditures while they largely remained indoors amid the pandemic, they had both time and surplus money. The returns in gold, real estate and fixed deposits have been lesser than stocks. With technological advances making it easier to trade in stocks, an increased number of people started investing in shares,” said Vaibhav Shah, managing director of Monarch Networth Capital, an Ahmedabad-based financial services company. “As India moves closer to becoming a $5 trillion economy, it is vital, now more than ever, that we focus on investor education and awareness to further propel the equity investment culture across the country,” suggested Chauhan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarats-stock-investors-on-bse-set-to-touch-1-crore-mark/articleshow/87836726.cms||Kalpesh Damor

The menace, which was earlier restricted to marriages, has not spared even birthday functions now. In a bid to curb this menace, the Centre had amended The Arms Act in December 2019 and made celebratory firing even with licensed guns at public gatherings, religious places, marriage or other functions a criminal offence attracting two years’ imprisonment and fine. But this information could not be properly publicised due to Covid-19 pandemic. Before this amendment, the Union ministry of home affairs had issued a detailed direction to all states based on which the Bihar home department had directed all DMs and SPs on February 14, 2019 to take stern action against those indulging in celebratory firing or public brandishing of weapons. However, despite the government’s tough stand, the menace continues unabated in the state. One Vicky Kumar (24) was killed in celebratory firing at a birthday function at Pirpa under the Ram Krishna Nagar police station area in Patna in the wee hours of Friday. On the same night, a videographer, Ravi Kant Singh (28), was killed and three others were injured in celebratory firing at a ‘tilak’ ceremony at Kadwan village in Rohtas district. Writer-cum-freelance journalist Pushya Mitra said the Britishers first started firing in air or paying gun salutes to pay respect to kings or landlords. “Landlords and rich people adopted this practice during British rule in India. Later it spread to other sections of society,” he said, adding people from the new generation would have to come forward to stop this menace. Sociologist D M Diwakar blamed industrialisation and feudal mentality to display power, especially among upper caste people, for incidents of celebratory firing. “We must understand the cultural deviation which has come from industrialisation. We used to express happiness by different means in older days, but it has changed now,” he said. Diwakar said there was a need to spread awareness among people about bad effects of celebratory firing. “Police or court will not be effective much,” he said, adding innocent people, including brides and grooms, were either injured or killed in celebratory firing in the recent past. Central range IGP Sanjay Singh said government also wants to curb celebratory firing. “The act is treated as criminal offence now even if no one is injured,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/celebratory-firing-even-with-licensed-guns-a-criminal-offence/articleshow/87836213.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Meanwhile, police sent two minor boys to remand home on Saturday allegedly for passing information of Rintu’s location to Ashish and Sudesh. Police said the two boys, both Class X students, were arrested from their native place in Sarsi on Friday. Rintu’s wife Anulika Singh, a newly-elected district board member, has alleged in the FIR that her husband was killed over political rivalry. Purnia SP Daya Shankar said the arrested minor boys were in continuous touch with shooter Ashish. “He had promised to give them money. We will pray for proclamation notices against the duo,” the SP added. He said Ashish and Sudesh are continuously changing locations. “Raids are on in bordering areas of Nepal and places outside Bihar to arrest them,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cops-intensify-raids-to-arrest-bihar-ministers-kin-others/articleshow/87836193.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Reason: RJD chief and former chief minister Lalu Prasad is likely to unveil a newly built lantern, the party’s election symbol, on the office premises. The RJD supremo is likely to depose before the CBI court in connection with a case related to fraudulent withdrawal of money from the Banka district treasury, an offshoot of the multi-crore animal husbandry scam, on November 23. The court had issued summons asking the accused to appear in person on the next date of hearing. Sources close to the family said the entry of visitors to the RJD office had been restricted as he would also unveil the 6-tonne lantern. RJD spokesperson Mrintunjay Tiwari told this reporter, “Lalu ji is coming to Patna to depose before the court. He has always adhered to the court’s directive.” Another RJD functionary said Lalu would stay in Patna for a day or two after his appearance in the court. “The lantern, which has been built on Tejashwi Yadav’s initiative, may be unveiled on the occasion,” he added. Sources claimed that the issue of caste census may be raised by the RJD again after the party supremo’s visit. The issue remained under wraps during the byelection held to Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly seats. Both the seats went to the ruling JD (U). Lalu, in a recent statement, said the country needed an aggressive agitation on the issue of caste-wise enumerations in the country like the farmers’ stir over the farm bills. “We are not ready to budge on the issue of caste-based census,” said another functionary. Earlier, the RJD chief had visited the state to campaign for the byelection in favour of the party nominees. However, the RJD candidates had to bite the dust in the recent held bypolls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lalu-likely-to-unveil-6-tonne-lantern-at-rjd-office/articleshow/87836350.cms||Ramashankar
---||Business||Chennai: TiE unknots business problems||CHENNAI: Gomathi, a power loom worker with Shanmuga Textiles at Dharmapuri, always has a to-buy list when she goes shopping. And she looks people in the eye while talking to them confidently, a complete change from how she was even two years ago. "Her work too has improved 3X, which is a huge benefit for a small businessman like me," says her employer A S Saravanan. At Alagendran Nidhi, a small finance company in Pudur, Muneeswari is confident of solving any work- related issues. "A positive attitude is a passport to a better tomorrow," says the woman who was scared of her own shadow till a few months ago. So how did the transformation happen? Both women attended a programme for personality improvement organised by The Indus Entrepreneur or TiE Chennai. "Personality transformation alone can bring about business transformation. This was the trigger for us to undertake sweeping changes at TiE during the pandemic," says CK Ranganathan, president of TiE Chennai. "In a chat with Lakshmi Narayan, (former CEO of Cognizant), he told me that it shouldn’t be just TiE Chennai, but TiE Tamil Nadu. We needed to reposition the forum beyond the tech sector and beyond Chennai. We needed a paradigm shift. A simple change — communicating in the native language — helped," says Ranganathan. The new strategy: Easy to use technology (WhatsApp) to communicate, use of Tamil, explaining complex management ideas through simple real life cases studies, only suggestions offered not advice. The result: In 15 months, the Chennai model has become the most sought after across the 25 TiE chapters in the country. TiE Chennai has grown from a network of 500 entrepreneurs to 9,000 businesses across Tamil Nadu. "We started off with a less than five minute audio capsule in Tamil, called catalyst, with messages on personality transformation/improvement," says Akhila Rajeshwar who spearheaded the initiative. The topics range from anger management to customer acquisition; listeners also get a task or two. "During the lockdown, people had time and once they started feeling improvements, it became a family affair," she says. More than 550 days of messages are now documented. Messages are localised and complex theories such as "Magic of Thinking Big" are recorded on phone audio and sent on WhatsApp every evening. Then there’s a peer-to-peer learning model called personal board where groups of 10 entrepreneurs meet virtually every 15 days. "The members are in non-compete businesses, not necessarily from the same geography. They are encouraged to develop business plans with an actionable agenda. Each member will have an accountability partner who will monitor everything, be it revenue increase or employee performance. Some members even share their fitness goals. There was initial hesitancy, but when people saw the benefits of team work, there is a groundswell now," says Rajeshwar. Conversing in Tamil has increased the bonding. ‘Biz Kadhai Kekkalam Vaanga’ is TiE Chennai’s third such initiative. Each episode, uploaded every Sunday on TiE’s Tamil website, tells a story -- return of Tatas to aviation or success formula of Waycool Foods or BigBasket. There are more than 70 episodes online. After TiE received feedback that businessmen were facing regulatory issues, be it GST or filing returns, it rolled out a free programme where an eminent chartered accountant helped solve knotty regulatory issues. A paid weekly programme for employees teaches simple soft skills such as grooming and talking softly and slowly. TiE Learn deals with everything about a particular business. "We have begun this with the bakery business. Anyone who wants to know which machine to source, new products, and everything that a bakery needs, with granular business details," says Rajeshwar. And finally to bridge the gap between knowledge and the real world there is ‘Sindhikka Seyalpada’ (think, act). "Difficult management theories such as marketing myopia, adjacent profit pool are explained so that everyone knows how a business runs on the global map," she says. "The impact has been phenomenal. Formal entrepreneurship has reached the hinterlands like never before," says Arun Natarajan, CEO of Venture Intelligence, a firm that tracks startups activity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tie-unknots-biz-problems/articleshow/87836020.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli
---||Kolkata||Micro-tunnelling relief for Kolkata roads||KOLKATA: There may not be any manual digging up of roads for pipelines soon. Pipelines will likely be laid through micro-tunnelling or the trenchless technology. The Mamata Banerjee government has framed a comprehensive policy for streamlining the procedure of laying water pipelines and shifting utilities for infrastructure projects, like Metro, to minimize road damage and inconvenience to the public. Every time a pipeline is laid or utilities are shifted for infrastructure projects, residents and commuters are harassed. Things become worse during monsoon and the level of the road is not corrected afterwards, causing cave-ins. According to the latest policy decision, the harrowing cut-and-cover method of laying pipelines may now be be replaced by micro-tunnelling, which involves a remotely controlled micro-tunnel boring machine and pipe-jacking techniques to directly install pipelines underground in a single pass. With the finance department’s concurrence, the state public works department (PWD) on Wednesday issued an SOP, including a formula for restoring roads to their original state. The guidelines will be followed by state departments when water or sewerage pipelines are laid or utilities are required to be shifted by central agencies, like Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), while implementing Metro projects. According to the notification, to avoid the cut-and-cover method to the feasible extent, micro-tunnelling must be done, especially for road crossings. High-quality pipes will be utilized to arrest leakage. To ensure minimum damage to infrastructure, the pipelines will be laid through the extreme right of way to avoid traffic issues. While estimating the pipe-laying, the cost of road restoration must be incorporated. The guidelines have allowed excavation, subject to special permissions, in exceptional cases where micro-tunnelling may not be feasible. They have also empowered superintending engineers of departments concerned to grant permission to shift utilities instead of referring the decisions to headquarters. This, officials said, will help facilitate Metro projects where approvals stay pending when there is a question of shifting utilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/micro-tunnelling-relief-for-kol-roads/articleshow/87836848.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

Here’s some good news to make you feel secured as you visit Jambughoda wildlife sanctuary in Panchmahal or Ratanmahal sloth bear sanctuary in Dahod. You will be provided accidental insurance cover of up to Rs 50 lakh while visiting the facilities at Jambughoda, Shivrajpur and Ratanmahal by the associations of locals managing the forest department’s five eco campsites. “This insurance is not provided by the government, but by the ‘mandlis’ of locals managing the eco campsites,” range forest officer H D Raulji told TOI. In case of any untoward incidents, tourists will no longer need to shell out money from their own pockets, he explained, adding that Vadodara wildlife division will be the first in state to have such an insurance coverage for tourists. The five eco campsites – Dhanpari at Jambughoda, Targol and Bhat at Shivrajpur and Naldha and Udal Mahuda at Ratanmahal – have been witnessing a surge in tourists in the past few years. “Last year due to the pandemic the number of tourists were low, otherwise we get a footfall of 25,000 tourists in a year at all five eco campsites,” Raulji said. The associations are providing the insurance cover from their own pockets and during a year, they will consider two cases for providing insurance money. “Any person who would have taken entry pass at the gate or done online booking for overnight stay at eco campsites will be covered under this. This insurance will be for protection in case of a natural calamity or animal attack or insect or snake bite,” said Pradeepsinh Rana, president of association managing eco campsite Dhanpari at Jambughoda. Rana further said that the association believes that since tourists are spending money to have leisurely time, they should get whatever benefits it is able to provide.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/eco-campsite-tourists-to-be-insured/articleshow/87836274.cms||Jay Pachchigar
---||Business||Niva Bupa eyes Rs 5,000 crore in premium within 2 years||MUMBAI: True North-owned Niva Bupa Health Insurance has advanced its goal of achieving a premium income of Rs 5,000 crore by a year to FY24, following a pickup in sales. “We expect to end the year with a premium of Rs 2,700 crore, which is an increase of more than 50% over the previous year. We are expanding our agency network as well as our geographical presence and are opening one new branch every 3.5 days and already have 160 offices. We have also 15 bank partners and are growing our direct-to-customer and digital sales through a partnership with fintechs,” said Niva Bupa CEO Krishnan Ramachandran. He had joined Niva Bupa in May 2020 from Apollo Munich, where he was CEO. Apollo Munich was earlier acquired by HDFC Ergo General Insurance. Niva Bupa was originally promoted by Max in partnership with the UK-headquartered Bupa. In 2019, Max India sold its stake to True North, which acquired 55% through a special purpose vehicle Fettle Tone. Earlier this year, Axis Bank acquired a 9.9% stake in Fettle Tone, which gives it close to 5.5% interest in Niva Bupa Health. According to Ramachandran, most of the growth will come from increasing the penetration of health in the Indian market. Part of the company’s strategy is to launch a product every quarter to open up fresh segments for coverage. “We launched a product this year targeted at senior citizens. We also launched an all-new personal accident product targeted at proprietors of small and medium businesses and self-employed people. We are also going to be launching a product targeted at diabetics and people who have chronic conditions,” said Krishnan. While Covid has hit the bottom line of Niva Bupa along with other health insurers in the country, Ramachandran said that the company expects to turn in a profit in FY23. The company, which has a paid-up capital of Rs 1,500 crore, has seen its solvency margin dip to below 1.7 times the statutory requirement as against the 1.5 times required by the regulator. “There is no constraint of growth capital from the existing shareholders. From their standpoint, they are willing to fund as much growth capital as required,” he said. The profits for the current year are expected to be hit because of the higher combined ratio (of claims & management expenses to total premium). The combined ratio, which was 101% in the previous year, deteriorated to 113%, partly because of a higher outgo due to Covid claims and increased management expenses as it expanded its network. While it is not clear whether the increase in average medical costs seen during Covid will remain high, Ramachandran expects the combined ratio to improve with scale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/niva-bupa-eyes-rs-5000-crore-in-premium-within-2-years/articleshow/87837330.cms||Mayur Shetty

The first such municipal facility in the PMC limits would be ready in two months at the Kamla Nehru hospital. The decision to set up a blood bank was taken to serve multiple purposes. It would be helpfulin case of a Covid pandemic-like situation and would also be useful for the proposed municipal medical college. “The basic infrastructure for the facility is ready. The PMC is offering space and some equipment for the lab. Such type of a lab is mandatory to run a medical college,” said Sanjeev Wavare, a senior official of the civic body’s health department. He said the PMC had roped in a private agency to run the lab and it would provide expertise and manpower for the lab. Around 2,000sqft space has been made available for the facility at the Kamla Nehru hospital. According to the proposal, blood as well as various components of the blood would be provided to the patients. The PMC officials said the rate offered in this lab would be 30 % to 40% less compared to the government rates. “The need of civic blood bank came to light once again after the pandemic. The demand for blood had gone up and donors were less. It all led to crisis situation. This made municipal authorities work on the idea to start its own bank,” said a senior official of PMC. He said t the mandate of blood bank for municipal college had speeded up the process. This lab is one of the key feature for medical education to be imparted at civic medical college. Around 100 medical students will benefit from this initiative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pocket-friendly-blood-bank-of-pmc-to-start-in-two-months/articleshow/87836917.cms||---

According to the exchange filing, the number of monthly transacting users in the app rose to 5.7 crore in the quarter ended September, which is an increase of 70 lakh (14%) from 5 crore in the April-June period of this year. The disclosures come three days after the company listed on November 18 and reflect the pickup in business after the ebbing of the second wave of the pandemic. After floating the biggest initial public offering (IPO) of Rs 18,300 crore, shares of the company took a beating immediately on listing. They dropped 27% to close at the lower circuit, clocking the worst debut by any company with an IPO size of over Rs 1,000 crore. In terms of number, the company disbursed over 28 lakh loans in the second quarter this year — more than double the 14.3 lakh loans disbursed in the first quarter (see graphic). Year-on-year, the increase is more than 700% from the nearly 3.5 lakh loans clocked in the quarter ended September 2020. “In keeping with our disclosures in the prospectus, the growth momentum in gross merchandise value (GMV) continued in October 2021, driven by festive season spends as well as an increase in number of merchants & consumers, adoption of new products, transactions for both online & in-store merchants, and in deployed devices,” the company said in its filing. GMV is defined as value of total payments made to merchants through transactions on the Paytm app, through Paytm payment instruments or through the company’s payment solutions, over a period. It excludes any consumer-to-consumer payment services such as money transfer. GMV processed through the Paytm platform for the month of October 2021 aggregated to approximately Rs 83,200 crore, a growth of 131% over the month of October 2020. For the second quarter, the GMV was Rs 1,95,600 crore — up 33% from the preceding quarter. On a year-on-year basis, GMV was up 100%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/paytm-biz-picks-up-after-2nd-wave/articleshow/87837353.cms||---

During this period, customers were charged Rs 17.7 per transaction for digital payments using the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and RuPay debit cards. The practice was subsequently discontinued and the bank had refunded Rs 90 crore towards charges between January and September last year, but it continues to hold on to the fees made from earlier transactions. According to a report on the charges prepared by Ashish Das, a professor at IIT-Bombay, who had earlier highlighted these fees in another report, SBI imposed Rs 17.70 per transaction during June 2017 through December 2019 and of Rs 5.90 per transaction for April-May 2017. “During the 33 months April 2017 through December 2019, SBI collected anywhere between Rs 164 crore and Rs 177 crore towards charges imposed on at least 9 crore UPI and RuPay debit card digital transactions done by BSBDA (basic savings bank deposit account) customers. SBI has still not refunded this amount of over Rs 164 crore that has been improperly collected through the imposition of usurious charges on the BSBDA customers,” said Das. “There could be an operational difficulty for refund, but it has been demonstrated that it can be done. SBI has already done a refund for transactions during the six-month period ending September 2020,” said Das. He added that these charges were imposed on the JDY account, which was meant for the most vulnerable members of society and to be free of all charges. According to a banker, the JDY accounts are not as unprofitable as they used to be as the minimum balances in these accounts have gone up. Also, banks are servicing most of these accounts through business correspondents (BCs) to keep the costs low. Banks pay BCs a fee for every transaction they enable but the same is not passed on to the customer. While outsourcing does reduce costs for banks, lenders said that there have been instances where agents of BCs in connivance with customers round-tripped transactions and withdrew the same funds multiple times to increase fees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sbi-yet-to-refund-rs-164cr-charged-as-upi-fees-before-2020-to-jan-dhan-a/cs/articleshow/87837278.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||10 dental surgons, 50 others paid bribe for Haryana jobs||CHANDIGARH: Navin Kumar, first accused to be arrested in Haryana’s cash-for-job scam, confessed to have helped 10 candidates get through the dental surgeon’s recruitment examination for Rs 10 lakh each. Together with two others, he is also said to have done more than 50 paid selections through the Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC). This is his reported confession to the vigilance bureau that had claimed to have seized Rs 20 lakh bribe money from him before reaching Haryana Public Service Commission (HPSC) deputy secretary Anil Nagar. On Sunday, Panchkula’s duty magistrate remained Navin Kumar in judicial custody, where he told the interrogators that he along with Ashwani Kumar and another person had got 40 nurses, four VLDAs (veterinary and livestock development assistants), and 15 ANMs (auxiliary nurses and midwives) through the written examination. Each of these candidates had paid them Rs 10 lakh. The state vigilance bureau has shared the information with the HSSC and the HPSC, asking both agencies to verify the details. The HSSC is in the process of finalising the appointments. Navin Kumar was trapped behind a restaurant in Panchkula’s Sector 5, where he had come to collect Rs 20 lakh of the bribe money from a candidate, in Rs 500 notes. His lead and other evidence obtained during the investigation took the bureau to Ashwani Sharma’s house in Jhajjar district, from where it claimed to have seized Rs 1.07 crore cash, the alleged share of Haryana Civil Services (HCS) officer Anil Nagar. The officers made Sharma contact Nagar, who reportedly told him to bring the money to his HPSC office. The bureau claims that it caught Nagar accepting more than Rs 1 crore from Ashwani Sharma in his office. The raid on his house and associates yielded Rs 2.10 crore cash. They associates had kept most of it as his share.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/10-dental-surgons-50-others-paid-bribe-for-haryana-jobs/articleshow/87837468.cms||Manvir Saini
---||Nashik||Stones pelted at four MSRTC buses in Dhule on Sunday morning||NASHIK: Stones were pelted at four Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) buses after they were driven out of the Dhule bus terminus on Sunday morning, leaving one bus driver injured. The MSRTC authorities in Jalgaon and Dhule had started bus services by calling up recruits to take up the services. “A total of 11 buses started from Dhule bus terminus for intra-district destinations amid police protection. However, some miscreants pelted stones at four buses before the situation returned to normalcy,” said Manisha Sapkal, the MSRTC divisional controller of Dhule division. The MSRTC called up the wait-listed candidates to take up the jobs in both Dhule and Jalgaon districts. “The candidates appearing for recruitment test and clearing the selection procedure are given merit-based appointment. Those waiting to get appointment are put on waiting list. We took up the services of 11 such people today (Sunday),” Sapkal said. After the buses moved out of the terminus in police protection, some miscreants threw stones at the bus breaking the wind shield and injuring the bus driver. The bus was recalled and a complaint against unidentified person was registered. The driver of one of the buses, Vijay Bhamre, sustained injuries on his hand. However, thereafter the situation became normal. Similarly, four buses from Jalgaon also started plying to several places in district. The buses rolled out of the depots amid huge opposition by MSRTC employees, who are on strike for the last 15 days in both the depots. They are agitating with thousand others in the state, demanding the merging of the corporation with the state government. The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation has started taking action by terminating the daily wage workers, who are the probationary workers and have to complete 180 days before being inducted into the services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/stones-pelted-at-four-msrtc-buses-in-dhule-on-sunday-morning/articleshow/87835656.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Pune||Pune zilla parishad surveys 48,000 children aged 0-6 in rural areas||PUNE: The health department of the Pune zilla parishad carried out check-ups of over 48,000 of 3.35 lakh children aged between zero and six years over the last four weeks. The zilla parishad plans to complete the screening of all by the end of December. The drive aims to provide timely medical aid to children at the village level and has assumed significance in view of the ZP survey which found 1,248 malnourished children in the district in 2020. The programme is being conducted by the ZP health department and women and child welfare department of Pune district. First, Aanganwadi workers at the village level have enrolled the names of the children in zero to six age group in the district. “To implement this exercise, we have developed a dedicated software-based system. Various health parameters of the child, such as weight, height, age, symptoms of any disease, etc are keyed in. Based on the data input, the child is referred to a zilla parishad hospital. Then, the community health officer at the village level directs the child to a government or private hospital for treatment,” JB Girase, deputy chief executive officer of the ZP women and child welfare department told TOI on Sunday. The zilla parishad has carried out online training of all 410 community health officers (CHOs) who work at the sub-centres in rural parts of Pune district. In the past, health officials from different government departments and agencies used to carry out health check-ups of children at their levels. “However, we never generated comprehensive health data of a child. Hence, many of them did not get quality and timely healthcare in the district,” said a ZP official. With the new system, Girase said officials get a child’s health data daily. “If a child needs specialised treatment, we will make necessary arrangements at a government or private hospital depending upon the treatment needed. If required, the ZP will incur the cost of the treatment from its fund,” said Girase. ZP chief executive officer Ayush Prasad said a three-pronged strategy, which is must for a child’s health, includes early diagnosis, timely referral and active management, and will be addressed under this initiative. “We will soon hold special camps for children at the taluka level to provide specialised treatment in the district. This will various health concerns of children in this age group in all areas of the district,” said Prasad. Dr Indira Prakhe, head of the Primary Health Centre (PHC) in Khed taluka’s Shelpimpalgaon, said, “There are many parents who do not give necessary medical aid to their children due to financial issues in rural areas. This drive will certainly address several ground-level problems.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/zp-surveys-48k-children-aged-0-6-in-rural-areas/articleshow/87836928.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Jaipur||For me its principles, not individual matters: Sachin Pilot||JAIPUR: What did Sachin Pilot get in the cabinet makeover for which he had been struggling for the past 16 months, was the question being asked by the common man on social media following the announcement of a new ministry in Rajasthan. Supporters wanted him back as at least the deputy chief minister or the Pradesh Congress Committee president. On Sunday, when TOI asked Pilot what he got, the reply was, “Satisfaction. The Congress high command has got respectable representation for the party workers who toiled to form the government in 2018.” And what about his fight with chief minister Ashok Gehlot that took the Congress government in Rajasthan on the verge of collapse in July last year. Pilot rebuffed reports about differences with Gehlot or factionalism in Rajasthan Congress and said for him “principles” like proper representations of weaker sections, minorities, women and young people were more important than individual matters. “Experienced leaders from a wide spectrum of society have been included in the cabinet and it is definitely going to help us give good governance; we will get repeated in 2023,” Pilot added. In a boost to the weaker sections and with an eye on the 2023 state elections, the Congress central leadership has ensured nine of the 30 ministerial seats to SC and ST communities. Of the nine, four are cabinet ministers from the SC community. Govindram Meghwal is fresh in the cabinet, while Mamta Bhupesh Bairwa, Bhajan Lal Jatav and Tikaram Juli are junior ministers who have been promoted to cabinet ranks. All four are Gehlot backers. Similarly, among ST ministers, Mahendrajeet Singh Malviya and Ramesh Meena have been inducted as cabinet ministers and Murari Lal Meena as a junior minister. This is in addition to cabinet minister Prasadi Lal Meena and junior minister Arjun Bamaia being already there in the Gehlot ministry. Ramesh and Murari are Pilot loyalists. The lone Muslim candidate inducted is Zahida Khan as a junior minister. Shale Mohammad was already a cabinet minister. After the expansion, women representation has increased to three in Gehlot ministry. Earlier, Mamta was the lone woman minister. The cabinet expansion and reshuffle has increased representation for Dalits, tribes, minorities and women, but has failed to strike a regional balance within the state. Most ministers are from eastern Rajasthan—the home turf of Pilot—while there is not a single minister from 12 of the 33 districts in the state. In fact, 14 of the 30 ministers are from just four districts—Jaipur, Bikaner, Bharatpur and Dausa. The districts without ministers are Udaipur, Pratapgarh, Dungarpur and Sirohi in south, Dholpur and Sawai Madhopur in east, Ajmer and Tonk in centre, Sikar, Churu, Hanumangarh and Sriganganagar in the north. Gehlot later said, “Certain districts could not get representation because of our policy to not appoint first-term MLAs as ministers. But we will appoint advisors to CM, parliamentary secretaries and chairpersons of boards/commissions to cover it up.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/for-me-its-principles-not-individual-matters-sachin-pilot/articleshow/87837471.cms||Bhanupratap Singh

The family lives in a colony in Brahmavar at Saibrakatte. They were somehow scared of the side-effects the vaccine may induce. Asha workers, doctors and people’s representatives had tried convincing them, but they were not ready to take the shots. One family member had died of Covid-19 but still the family was unconvinced about the efficacy of vaccines. Kurma, who visited a public health centre at Saibrakatte on Saturday, learnt about the family. He visited the colony and succeeded in convincing the family about vaccine safety. Kurma told them: “The district administration will be with you if anything goes wrong after taking the vaccine.” Finally, the family told the DC that they will go for a vaccine one by one. The district has so far administered the first dose to 9.24 lakh (92.5%) of the 9.99 lakh target beneficiaries above 18 years. In total, 6.11 lakh (61.2%) have received the second dose, said Dr Nagbhushan Udupa, the district health and family welfare officer. “The district will start the Har Ghar Dastak campaign, a door-to-door vaccination drive, on November 22 and the same will be held till November 30. Angnawadi and Asha workers will visit homes and check the voters’ list to identify vaccine beneficiaries. Those who have not received the vaccine will be given the doses at their doorstep,” Nagbhushan said. He appealed to people to join hands so that the district reaches 100% vaccine insulation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/udupi-dc-convinces-family-of-7-to-take-vaccine/articleshow/87836172.cms||---
---||Kochi||Plan to intensify stir in coming days||Kochi: Even as Syro-Malabar Church is all set to implement the uniform way of conducting Holy Mass from next Sunday, protests against the move are intensifying in various dioceses. Laity activists, in dioceses like Ernakulam-Angamaly, vowed to conduct more stringent protests in coming days if the Church went ahead with the move. The issue pertains to the differences in conducting Holy Mass in various dioceses of the Church, an obvious difference being the priest facing the churchgoers during ceremony in some dioceses and facing the altar in others. The unified way is a combination of both. As per the Church synod’s decision, uniform mass will come into effect from Nov 28. Sources said priests and laity from Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese will hold a Mass on Nov 28 at 3pm in the prevailing style. Sources close to dissenting priests said over 100 priests will attend the mass. On Sunday, a representative meeting by a laity organisation of Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese, Almaaya Munnettam, was held at Kochi Renewal Centre which decided to oppose the uniform mode. “We won’t allow any form other than the Mass facing the people. If an attempt is made at any church in the diocese to conduct Mass in any other form, we will protest,” said Riju Kanjookkaran, spokesperson of the outfit. Meanwhile on Saturday, Forane vicars of Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese wrote to the priests asking them to continue Mass facing the people. According to their letters sent, major archiepiscopal vicar of the archdiocese, archbishop Mar Antony Kariyil has gone to the Vatican to apprise higher authorities in the church about the request of priests and laity to allow them to continue Mass facing the people. The type of mass prevailing at the archdiocese for the past five decades was the one in which the priest conducts the ceremony facing the people, said protesters. Earlier, priests from Palakkad, Irinjalakuda, Thrissur, Thamarassery, dioceses too had marched to the headquarters of the church raising the same issue. Also, hundreds of laity members had marched to the centre demanding the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/plan-to-intensify-stir-in-coming-days/articleshow/87836938.cms||---

In all, 18.5 crore records have been scanned and digitized. These will be available at the click of a mouse.  After inaugurating the record rooms, the CM said earlier it was difficult to maintain, preserve and find old revenue records. “It took a long time to find the records and there was a possibility of records getting damaged, torn, go missing or get tampered with,” he said. The first modern revenue record room in the State was set up in Kaithal district, as a pilot project, on June 24, 2017. On December 25, 2019, to mark Good Governance Day, the state started the project for all districts. Khattar said the 75th Amrit Mahotsav was being celebrated all over the country and Haryana had expanded e-governance services by digitizing revenue records. In future, important records related to other departments will also be digitized in the same manner, he said. Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, who holds the portfolio of revenue and disaster management department, said revenue records were of great importance and it was a challenge to preserve them properly in the old way. The revenue department has scanned records in a short time and then uploaded them on the portal of NIC, he said. Additional chief secretary and finance commissioner Sanjeev Kaushal said despite circumstances like Covid-19, work went on undeterred.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/18-5-crore-revenue-records-of-haryana-now-available-online/articleshow/87837469.cms||---

Dr Supe, however, cautioned against dropping guards. “Every person who is due for vaccination should get it,” he said. About the possibility of a delayed third wave, he said, “Several western countries have seen a delayed surge. If new mutations come into play, we may see a surge in February or March. But if people wear masks, get vaccinated and maintain distance, we shouldn’t see the severity of the second wave,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-active-cases-in-state-remain-low/articleshow/87837760.cms||---

The ISBT is smaller in both size and passenger traffic than the Kashmere Gate and Anand Vihar ISBTs. Still, efforts are being made to provide passenger amenities at the transit facility that are at par with or even better than the other terminals. Dr Punit Sethi, the officer heading the project, said that besides the room, a new waiting hall has also been opened for passengers at the Veer Hakikat Rai ISBT at Sarai Kale Khan. “New facilities have been designed in such a way to provide convenience to disabled people, such as ramps, railings, toilets, low-height steps, etc. Tactile facilities have been added for easy movement of the visually challenged,” he said. He said that a woman passenger who arrived from Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh became the first to use the baby feeding room with her six-month-old daughter on Thursday. According to officials, Delhi government has been exploring the possibility of building breastfeeding and childcare rooms at public places in the capital and has a draft policy in place for building baby-feeding rooms. Sethi said the addition of facilities and improving the existing amenities for passengers and the public had been done following directions of principal secretary-cum-commissioner (transport) Ashish Kundra. Delhi Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd. (DTIDC), an enterprise of Delhi government that maintains and operates the three ISBTs, is trying to identify obstructions that may exist in providing a barrier-free environment and accessibility at these transit hubs. The corporation wants the IBST buildings, bus bays and other areas to be usable by senior citizens, persons with disabilities and those with reduced mobility. The corporation is also focussing on making the approach to the building premises, offices, ticket counters and windows, parking and drop off points, entrance, reception, help desk and visitor facilitation areas more accessible. Other facilities that are expected to become barrier-free are the public conveniences, drinking water areas, canteen, snacks counters, shops, etc, apart from ensuring that there are adequate information boards, timetables, signage, apart from accessible stairs and elevators at ISBTs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/baby-feeding-room-facilities-for-disabled-at-isbt/articleshow/87836934.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Pune||Diabetes among dogs increased by 10-20% during pandemic: Vets||PUNE: Cases of diabetes in dogs have increased 10-20% during the Covid-19 pandemic, say veterinarians. Narendra Pardeshi, a vet surgeon, said, “Diabetes among dogs causes delayed healing of wounds, muscle weakness, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, and renal failure, and the chances of having irreversible complications are more than 80% if not treated at the right time.” He added, “Just like how humans go for tests every six months, even pet owners need to go for regular follow-ups with the doctor. While juvenile diabetes is seen in dogs at the age of two-three months, cases of Type 2 diabetes, which are more common, are seen in dogs aged six to eight years.” Sagar Bhongle, a veterinarian who has treated over 10 new cases of diabetes in dogs in the last three months, said, “The initial symptoms include excessive thirst (polydipsia) and urination (polyuria), and if the condition progresses untreated then the dog might start losing weight also. While there is pet-specific insulin available abroad, it is very difficult to find it in India.” Mahesh Kasbe, a veterinary pathologist, said, “In most cases, we check the urine sample for ketones but sometimes we also have to check the blood sample and the level of glucose concentration.” Veterinarian Anjali Dave said pet parents need to be aware of the dos and don’ts and follow the guidelines. “It is often difficult to make a correct diagnosis because the pet parents are unable to answer the vet’s questions and give them enough information about the pet’s symptoms.,” she said. There has been an increase in all kinds of lifestyle diseases among dogs owing to lack of awareness on the part of pet parents, say experts. “Pets can develop lifestyle diseases such as arthritis, cardiac conditions, weight and skin-related issues,” said veterinarian surgeon Sanjay Das. Mahesh Brahmankar, a veterinarian pathologist, said dry dog food and treats available in the market contain sugar. “Most popular brands contain sugar, which is not suitable for dogs. The best way to keep such diseases at bay is to provide them with a balanced diet,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/diabetes-among-dogs-increased-by-10-20-during-pandemic-vets/articleshow/87836936.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Increased representation of weaker sections has sent positive message, says Sachin Pilot||JAIPUR: Former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot on Sunday expressed happiness at the fresh composition of Ashok Gehlot cabinet in Rajasthan saying that the Dalit representation has increased four-fold and the scheduled tribe representation has increased three times. Pilot said the representation of women and minorities has been considerably increased to accommodate sections that have stood with the Congress and it has sent a ‘positive message’ across the state. “The cabinet changes have guaranteed that Rajasthan’s Congress government will get repeated in 2023. BJP was predicting our government’s fall after the cabinet reshuffle, but the rejig has worked to strengthen us 25 times more,” Pilot said at a press conference here. "The way Congress fought BJP for farmers resulted in Prime Minister Narendra Modi withdrawing the three farm laws. We will continue to expose the deeds of BJP, which is our key opponent in Rajasthan,” he said. Pilot said the cabinet reshuffle was based on feedback and opinions of all the state leaders. He even thanked Gehlot, AICC leader Ajay Maken and PCC chief Govind Singh Dotasra, along with the party high command, on the selection of new ministers. “This AICC decision (of cabinet rejig) is comprehensive, accurate and well thought out,” Pilot said. He added that more party workers would be accommodated in governance through political appointments in boards/commissions in the coming days. The former deputy CM said, “I have always talked about principles like increasing representation of SC, ST, OBC, minorities, women and young people who toiled for us. It is not about individuals but collective leadership. Our aim is to break the state’s tradition by repeating Congress government here. I am happy that the AICC committee has taken steps on the issues raised and will continue to do more in the state.” On his role in the party, Pilot said, “Whatever responsibility the Congress gave me in the past, I fulfilled it with total commitment. I shall do the same in future also whenever a role is assigned to me.” Pilot claimed there were no separate camps in Rajasthan Congress. “We contested the 2018 election collectively under the leadership of Sonia Gandhi ji, Rahul Gandhi ji and Priyanka Gandhi ji. The 2023 election too would be fought in the same way.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/increased-representation-of-weakersections-has-sent-positive-message/articleshow/87837478.cms||---

Interacting with the media here, he said the arrest of HPSC deputy director Anil Nagar and vigilance bureau’s leads secured from the other three accused were a proof of large-sclale corruption in the two state recruitment agencies. He said: “Already there was a question mark on the HSSC after scams and paper leaks and now the HPSC as well has come under the scanner. For the agencies responsible for recruitment tests to face these allegations is more shocking and a reason why the government should disband both.” Hooda accused the state’s BJP-JJP government of not taking a call on withdrawing the criminal cases registered against the farmers. He said: “It took the government a year to announce the repeal. A timely decision could have saved lives and not let the farmers suffer. The government should start withdrawing the cases before even the repeal goes into process.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hooda-for-judicial-probe-into-job-scam/articleshow/87837473.cms||---

Lobo also claimed that the accused misappropriated Rs 3 crore from his family’s funds lying as outstanding credit balance. Investors Miguel D’Souza and Lionel Gomes also filed similar complaints of Rs 10.8 crore and Rs 3.2 crore, respectively.

---||Kochi||Kerala CM, senior leaders greet Congress veteran VS Vijayaraghavan||PALAKKAD: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and several top leaders of various political parties greeted veteran Congress leader and three-time Member of Parliament (MP) from Palakkad VS Vijayaraghavan on his 80th birthday on Sunday. While wishing Vijayaraghavan, the CM said, “He is a man who always stood with people and kept his cordial relations with everyone above politics. As a Parliamentarian he always fought for the interests of Kerala in Parliament and outside. His work as the chairman of coir board was an example for others.” The birthday celebrations were inaugurated by All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary KC Venugopal. Several leaders of various political parties participated in the celebrations and recalled the great services of Vijayaraghavan to Congress and the people of Palakkad in his 60-year long political activism. Hailing from Erimayur in Alathur from a well-known family of farmers, his father VG Sukumaran was the state president of SNDP Yogam. Vijayaraghavan was a close confidant of late chief minister K Karunakaran. When Congress split in 1969 he stood with late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. In the 1977 assembly elections he contested against the CPM veteran late EMS Namboodiripad from Alathur constituency. Though EMS won with a narrow margin he described it as only a technical victory for him but the real victor was Vijayaraghavan. He was elected to Lok Sabha three times from Palakkad in 1980, 1984 and 1990. He was the Palakkad district Congress committee (DCC) president for 25 years continously. He was also chairman of the coir board. Former governor of Maharashtra K Sankaranarayanan, a long-term party colleague, though keeping ill-health, reached to greet Vijayaraghavan. CPM central committee member and former minister AK Balan, former leader of opposition Ramesh Chennithala, MPs, MLAs and other prominent personalities from various walks of life attended the celebrations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cm-senior-leaders-greet-cong-veteran-vijayaraghavan/articleshow/87836952.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Fat Gujarat weddings missing NRG boost||Come winters, and the business community in Gujarat gets all thrilled as non-resident Gujaratis (NRG) from across the world flock to the state for big fat weddings and spend a fortune. But travel restrictions due to the Covid pandemic over the last 20 months took the glow off the wedding industry, as many NRGs cancelled marriages. From wedding planners and garment showrooms to top hoteliers and jewellers, those used to a peak season between December and January have seen a decline in custom. The high demand in the local market, though, has come as a saviour for the wedding business. Event planners miss out on business from Gujaratis abroadThough the domestic weddings have picked up this year and recreated a buzz in the industry, wedding planners say that they were counting on the NRG marriages. "We saw some weddings of NRGs from the US and Canada cancelled this month as the families couldn’t travel due to flight issues. Because of the pandemic and travel restrictions, the number of international flights haven’t just reduced but the ticket costs, too, have gone up," said Harsh Jain, owner of Ahmedabad-based Dezire Events. "Most NRGs prefer to get married here between December 15 to January 15 as they get Christmas or New Year vacations at the time. But in 2020 and this year, our NRG wedding business dropped by about 30%," Jain added. "NRG weddings are barely taking place this year due to travel and other restrictions. This year, however, a majority of the business is coming from the domestic market with people preferring both local as well as destination weddings," said Pintoo Dandwala, owner of an Ahmedabad-based event management firm. According to Krunal Parekh, an Ahmedabad-based wedding planner said, "We have received eight of ten inquiries from NRIs from countries such as US, Germany and Nigeria, for weddings in January-February and even May and June. Nothing concrete has been finalised as yet. Usually, these weddings are planned much earlier, and bookings are made in advance, but due to the pandemic situation, the events have not been planned." Guest cap raised, local unions swell industry hopesEstimates by wedding planners and event managers suggested that the domestic wedding market has overall gained momentum. With Covid-19 cases remaining low, fewer restrictions on public movement and the cap on guests being at 400, people are organising weddings much more confidently than before, say wedding planners. Occasions which had been planned but deferred last year due to one or the other reason are being organised this year. In fact, destination weddings as well as those in the city are taking place in a big way. Krunal Parekh, an Ahmedabad-based wedding planner, said, "There is more demand than supply of venues both in Ahmedabad as well as at preferred locations for destination weddings. Udaipur has remained to be the hot favourite of people who are organising destination weddings and these typically take place with a guest list of some 200-300 people. Inquiries for planning weddings at Goa and Mussoorie are also coming along well. Jaipur, Jodhpur and Jaisalmer are also being preferred for destination weddings, suggest industry players. This time around, there are fewer muhurats and therefore, availability of venues on certain dates is a challenge. For instance, November 21-22; November 27-28 and December 9-10 are good muhurats over the coming months and hotels as well as party plots are fully booked so much so that a given property is hosting two weddings or occasions in a day. "Celebrations deferred last year are now being held. In November alone, there are 21 weddings at our hotel. On certain muhurats the demand is so good that we’re hosting three events simultaneously," said Jay Sudhakaran, general manager, Novotel Ahmedabad. Cancelled functions leave hoteliers worriedFrom plush wedding venues to the rooms for the guests, the hotel industry has always generated a major business from NRG weddings. The pandemic, though, didn’t just take away their regular business but also impacted the marriage bookings. Many hoteliers are sceptical and feel that they won’t get many bookings from NRGs this season too. "We used to generate a lot of revenue from NRG weddings but now our business has plummeted to just 20% of the normal bookings. Many NRGs still have Covid scare and the restrictions on travel along with the international flight connectivity issues have ensured that most weddings get cancelled," said Piyush Shah, managing director, Grand Mercure Surya Palace. Domestic demand provides cushion to stakeholdersDeep Preet Bindra, general manager, Courtyard by Marriott, Ahmedabad, said, "Even though NRG business is not there, demand from local clients is good. Even those people who could not hold destination weddings due to lack of availability of venues in other locations are hosting weddings at hotels within the city and therefore, the business and revenues are good."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fat-guj-weddings-missing-nrg-boost/articleshow/87836951.cms||Tushar Tere

---||Chandigarh||Uneven roads cause for concern, especially if there is fog: Residents||Ludhiana: The residents living in colonies in Haibowal area are having a tough time due to uneven roads. Both the main road and the road from Bhuri wala Gurdwara towards Chander Nagar are a nightmare to go on even after the civic officials have closed the pits after laying down sewerage pipes. The officials claimed that there are chances the road will be relaid next year after winter season. A commuter and resident of Joshi Nagar, Sunny Gupta said, “It is very difficult to pass through here — on one side sewerage pipes are being laid while at other half traffic gets stuck. And towards Chander Nagar road, sewerage is being laid down for a long time, but still it is not complete.” He said there is a need to expedite such works, as it cause lot of issues, especially for the commuters. Meanwhile, shopkeeper Pankaj Garg said, “We have to keep the doors of shop shut most of the time because it is very dusty all around. Due to this ongoing work, shoppers have stopped coming this side and our business also got affected.” He said the officials should increase the pace and complete the work as soon as possible. When contacted executive engineer of bridges and road department of municipal corporation (MC) Raman Kaushal said, “Recently new sewerage work is being laid down at main road and unless it will settle down we cannot construct road. The road can caved in if we will not give time to sand to settle down.” He said they should wait for at least one rainy season before construction of the road. Sub divisional officer of operation and maintenance cell, Anshu Gacha said, “It will take one week more for completion of sewerage laying work and after that we will get the road even for movement of traffic.” Notably, at Haibowal main road, a car had got stuck in the caved-in road near petrol pump and the car driver and his son had a narrow escape.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/uneven-roads-cause-for-concern-especially-if-there-is-fog-residents/articleshow/87837475.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Their DU journey starts from in front of screen||NEW DELHI: First-year students of Delhi University will yet again spend the first day of college in front of their laptops and phone screens and the orientation programme venue will be Zoom and Google Meet links. Colleges have planned a daylong orientation programme to give the students a sneak-peak of what the courses they would study be and who would be teaching them. RK Dwivedi, admission convener at Aryabhatta College, said, “During physical orientation, we used to organise lunch and tours for outstation parents and students. Now, teachers will be briefing them about the courses and college online. We will also give them a little idea about the different societies.” At Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC), the new joinees have been provided with links to attend the orientation event from 10am. Classes will begin from November 23. The non-teaching staff has been invited to watch the event offline. Rajdhani College would be holding the orientation programme over two days. For BA (Hons) students, the event would be held on Tuesday and other courses on Monday. In some colleges, seniors have planned introductory sessions. However, freshers are disappointed as their life has turned out completely different from what they had been imagining since a long time. Darshan Ram, a BCom student at Hindu College, told TOI, “My friends and I had been talking about this for a really long time. There were a lot of expectations from college life. We are disappointed as DU isn’t going to open until 100% seating capacity is permitted. This means we will be missing out on yet another important experience of our lives.” Despite being a Delhiite, Ram hasn’t visited any of the colleges yet. He has been taking virtual tours through Google. Sanjana Samajpati, who would be joining Maitreyi College, said the last year of school was not only unexpected, but also difficult as they didn’t have a single offline class. “When the board exams got cancelled, it was another disappointment. Joining DU has always been a dream. While school life came to an end sitting in front of my laptop, I expected college life to be normal,” added the history (hons) student.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/their-du-journey-starts-from-in-front-of-screen/articleshow/87836949.cms||Shradha Chettri

As a result of social distancing at schools, due to the prevailing Covid-19 situation, some of the government schools are facing a shortage of classrooms. This has been accentuated as more students have been admitted in schools. A government higher primary school in Aliyoor in Moodabidri taluk is one such example. The school has been conducting classes on the school stage and in makeshift classrooms. “The school which had about 200 students last year, now has 325 students. As a result, there is a shortage of classrooms. In order to accommodate all the students, the school development and monitoring committees (SDMC) decided to have a makeshift classroom for grade IV and VII. For grade VII, classes are held throughout the day on the school stage. Classes are held for half-a-day in a makeshift classroom for grade IV students, who are shifted to a classroom when LKG/UKG children leave for home in the afternoon,” said Devaraju, block education officer, Moodabidri. The school has seven classrooms. Commenting on the shortage of classrooms in the district, Dakshina Kannada zilla panchayat CEO Kumar said that district administration will immediately find a solution to address this issue. “As far as the Moodabidri issue is concerned, we had sanctioned grants, but work did not take off due to tender issues. We have again initiated the process, and work will commence at the earliest. Meanwhile, we will also identify other schools facing the same issue,” he told TOI. Malleswamy, DDPI, Dakshina Kannada, said there are two schools in the district, which are facing an issue of shortage of classes that needs immediate action. Social distancing has forced us to have more classrooms. “The school in Moodabidri has been sanctioned Rs 21.2 lakh to construct two additional classrooms,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/zp-to-construct-additional-classrooms/articleshow/87836208.cms||Kevin Mendonsa
---||Chandigarh||Ring road project hits dead-end as NHAI yet to get approval||Barinderjit.saluja Mohali: The 200-feet wide ring road project to decongest Zirakpur by easing Shimla-bound traffic has had no headway with the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) yet to get approval for the Rs 800 crore project. The project, which was mooted in 2013, came to a halt in 2014 and now in 2021, it is still to see the light of day. In 2018-19, Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) transferred around 100 acres of land to the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), but NHAI is yet to get approval for the project. R P Singh, regional officer, NHAI said, “We are yet to get approval from higher authorities for the project worth Rs 800 crore. We will start the land acquisition process once we get approval.” The 14-kilometre road is to originate from Ambala-Zirakpur highway, pass through Peer Muchalla, Sanoli, Gazipur, Nagla and all Mohali villages before joining the Sector 26-27 dividing road in Panchkula. Once the road is complete, Shimla-bound traffic can take this road, bypass the bottleneck at Zirakpur and join the Shimla highway at the end of Panchkula. Ambala or Delhi-bound traffic from Shimla can also avoid Zirakpur. According to the Master Plan committee, traffic between Mullanpur and Panchkula and that from Kansal, Zirakpur and Panchkula goes towards Chandigarh for “no reason.” Hence, the project will greatly help reduce traffic congestion on the arterial roads of Chandigarh—Madhya Marg and Dakshin Marg. The road will also open an alternative route from Panchkula to the new international airport terminal in Mohali, but it will be much longer than the existing route via Industrial Area, the Zirakpur-Chandigarh road, Sector 48 of Chandigarh, through Aerocity and IT City in Mohali. However, the new route will avoid traffic of Chandigarh. The project is being implemented to prevent around 1.5 lakh vehicles from Punjab and Haryana from entering the city daily. Chandigarh’s Master Plan also proposes this road to divert the inter-state traffic around the city for better traffic management. In August 2017, then Union home minister Rajnath Singh had approved the project during a meeting of the Northern zonal council in Chandigarh. The project holds greater significance in view of Rajnath putting the brakes on the much-touted Metro project for Chandigarh in July 2017 and asking the UT administration to look for alternative modes of transport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ring-road-project-hits-dead-end-as-nhai-yet-to-get-approval/articleshow/87836953.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Dehradun||Now, Kejriwal promises free pilgrimage for elderly of all faiths in Uttarakhand||Dehradun/Haridwar: After free electricity and government jobs, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who was in Haridwar on Sunday ahead of 2022 assembly elections, promised a free pilgrimage scheme for the elderly people belonging to all faiths if the party comes to power in Uttarakhand. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener said the scheme will be on the lines of the 'Mukhyamantri Tirth Yatra Yojana’ in national capital Delhi. “Like in Delhi, we are going to start a free pilgrimage scheme in Uttarakhand as well if AAP is voted to power here. Hindus can visit Ayodhya, Muslims to Ajmer Sharif and Sikhs to Kartarpur Sahib for free. The government in Delhi has now included Ayodhya visit for free. A special train will start from Delhi on December 3 to take pilgrims to the holy site. Vote for us, we will improve your life and afterlife,” Kejriwal said, adding that as many as 36,000 people have already availed of the scheme so far in Delhi. The Delhi government scheme provides free pilgrimage opportunities to people over 60 years of age. Started in 2018, it was suspended for a year-and-a-half due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Last month, it decided to include Ayodhya in the scheme. Taking a swipe at the BJP and the Congress during a press conference, Kejriwal said AAP is the only party in the country that focuses on the problems faced by the common people. "AAP's focus is on good hospitals, building excellent schools and constructing good roads, unlike other parties which don't emphasise on interests of the people," Kejriwal said. Kejriwal appealed to the people of Uttarakhand to give one chance to AAP, after which "people of the stare will forget all other parties". "BJP and Congress regimes in the Himalayan state since its creation have failed to deliver on their promises. Their leaders say they have conducted sting operations on each other, but neither took any action against each other," he added. The Delhi chief minister also slammed the Centre’s Ayushman scheme, calling it a “big scandal” and saying it was nothing compared to Delhi government’s health scheme. While speaking to auto-rickshaw and taxi operators during a roadshow in Haridwar, Kejriwal said AAP will introduce “faceless RTO services and free treatment for accident victims.” He later took an auto ride, a photograph of which was tweeted by AAP members. Kejriwal, who is visiting the poll-bound hill state for the third time in the last couple of months, had earlier promised 300 units of free electricity to every household, a government job to a member of each family and an unemployment allowance of Rs 5,000 per month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/now-kejriwal-promises-free-pilgrimage-for-elderly-of-all-faiths-in-uttarakhand/articleshow/87836212.cms||Gaurav Talwar

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Rajaji Tiger Reserve sees real-life Man vs Wild for 2 nights||DEHRADUN: In a miraculous escape mirroring the script of a survival series, a man dodged a leopard attack, swam across the Ganga to a forest area for safety, got lost in the jungle -- full of wild animals -- for 2 nights and was thereafter rescued, all without getting a scratch. Anurag Singh, a 30-year-old balloon vendor, was returning from Rishikesh, where he works, to his home in Bijnor, when he passed the Chilla area of Rajaji Tiger Reserve on Thursday. It was evening, the Ganga and the forest looked beautiful and being a photography enthusiast, he stopped his bike and took out his phone to take a selfie with the river as the backdrop. This is when a leopard emerged from the bushes and pounced at him. Fearing for his life, Singh jumped into the river. Recounting what happened next, Praveen Rawat, a police official who was part of the team that eventually rescued Singh, told TOI, “As soon as he jumped into the water, he found a log and clung to it. He ended up on a patch of forest land surrounded by water. Luckily, his bag was still with him although he lost his mobile phone while jumping into the river.” The bag was water-proof and had matches inside. Singh lit a bonfire to keep himself warm and then climbed a tree to avoid wild animals. After spending the night on top of the tree, he ventured into the nearby forest the next morning, hoping to find a way to human habitation. “He told us that he kept walking inside the jungle throughout the day but couldn’t find a way out. Eventually, he spent another night in the forest, lighting a bonfire and sleeping on top of a tree,” Rawat, who is in-charge of the Saptrishi chowki at Haridwar, said. Singh resumed walking through the forest the next day on Saturday and ended up in a stretch of the forest opposite Shadani Ghat in Haridwar. He again lit up a fire in order to warm himself and also hoping that somebody would notice the smoke and reach out to him. This time, he got lucky as the smoke from the fire was spotted by police. “We went on a raft to the area from where the smoke was coming and saw him waving hysterically, asking to be rescued,” Rawat said, adding that they alerted Jal Police, which patrols the Ganga waters in the area. “He was shivering and hungry when Jal Police got him. We helped him change his clothes and have some food. Only after that, he shared his ordeal with us,” Rawat said, adding that Singh was “badly shaken by the ordeal but otherwise safe and sound, and was sent back to his home in Nagal Soti village in Bijnor."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/man-vs-wild-biker-taking-selfie-in-rajaji-forest-dodges-leopard-jumps-into-ganga-spends-2-nights-in-forest-before-being-rescued/articleshow/87836244.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Schools urge state to make offline classes mandatory||MUMBAI: As attendance in educational institutions continues to be voluntary, schools are worried about the poor response from students to physical classes as they reopen post-Diwali vacation on Monday. A few schools that reopened last week (schools had the choice to reopen from November 11 to 22) reported fewer students than when they started physical classes on October 4. As of now, only class 8-12 students are allowed offline schooling in the city, provided there is parental consent. The rest have to learn online. In rural Maharashtra, physical schools are permitted from Class 5 to 12, with parental consent. School heads have urged the state to revisit its Covid-19 protocols and make in-person learning compulsory. Schools have been ringing up parents to know if they have changed their minds and want to send children to schools.  The majority of schools said that if given an option, parents still want to continue with online classes. “Students who had parental consent to attend physical schools are also reluctant to be in classrooms post-Diwali. Our physical attendance dropped compared to when we first reopened in October,” said the principal of a Chembur school that began classes from November 11. While educators are urging the state to reopen all classes, they also want the government to make attendance mandatory. Class X students are more regular in attending schools, compared to eighth and ninth standards. “The state should make attendance in higher classes compulsory. The parental consent clause can stay for students from lower classes,” said a principal from a Santacruz school. A group of parents from the city have written an open letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to reopen physical schools for all classes.  They have pointed out that children are going to malls and parties.  The state school and health departments have given the nod to reopen all schools after consultations with the state paediatric task force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-schools-urge-state-to-make-offline-classes-mandatory/articleshow/87837782.cms||Sandhya Nair

The evaluation has identified various hurdles to sustainably tap the full potential of blue resources, such as lack of required skills, inadequacy of polices, adverse impact of numerous anthropogenic activities like overexploitation, overfishing, habitat destruction, unplanned urban and industrial development and pollution in addition to climate change, that pose a threat to resources and livelihoods that depend on them. The report prepared with the financial assistance of the World Bank, was released in the presence of DIG S B Venkatesh, commander, Coast Guard, Karnataka, additional director, (inland) department of fisheries, Dinesh, and additional director (harbour), Malpe Thippeswamy and other dignitaries. Dr A Senthil Vel, professor and dean (fisheries), COF, said that under this assessment, the various established and emerging sectors of the blue economy have been examined, and brief status papers as well as a summary outline blue economy plan have been prepared in consultation with various stakeholders, with an aim to develop an all-inclusive sustainable framework to enhance the long-term economic growth, employment and sustenance of livelihoods from our resources. Currently, the fisheries sector provides livelihoods to around 9.6 lakh fishermen, of which 3.3 lakh are marine fishermen and 6.3 lakh are inland fishermen. The report has suggested sustainable water-based tourism, and to form a four-tier blue economy high-level committee headed by the chief minister.  World Fisheries Day is celebrated every year on November 21, to honour the hard work of fishing communities all over the world, and their contribution in providing quality and nutritious food to a large population. The technical sessions included lectures by Prof Iddya Karunasagar, an eminent microbiologist and FAO consultant and Prof R Ramesh, director, National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management, Chennai. Dr Indrani Karunasagar, sirector (R&D), Nitte University Centre for Science Education & Research, was present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/report-on-blue-economy-potential-in-karnataka-released/articleshow/87836239.cms||---

---||Delhi||Parent outreach programme of Delhi govt goes global||NEW DELHI: The parents’ outreach programme in Delhi government schools is being studied by the researchers from the University of Glasgow, Tilburg University and Kings College London, as part of their study at KREA University. Parents’ Outreach Program or Parents’ Samvaad is an initiative launched by the directorate of education on October 28. It is a scheme wherein schools will connect with parents of around 35,000 students so that children can benefit from better education and better parenting. As part of the study, researchers will study the impact of the programme and bring an end-line evaluation. The evaluation and research will be conducted with a data set of schools randomly selected by the researchers as per the requirement of the appropriate sample size. “The researchers had approached the government saying they wanted to learn about the facets of School Management Committee (SMC). We then told them about the parents’ outreach programme and were keen on working on it. The approval process has been completed and now they will be visiting schools,” said a senior DoE official. The team includes a team of researchers, economists, and education academics from the University of Glasgow, Tilburg University and King’s College London, represented to conduct the fieldwork by their local project partner LEAD at KREA University. “The final result will depict the impact of the parents’ outreach programme, focusing on the indicators and research questions provided in the proposal. The evaluation will be conducted through regular school visits, conducting interviews with the school head, teachers and outreach group members,” added the official. The research will also try and capture the kind of conversation that takes place between the mitras and the parents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/parent-outreach-programme-of-delhi-govt-goes-global/articleshow/87836987.cms||Shradha Chettri

According to data obtained under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, the state registered 303 cases in 2020 as against 151 in 2019 and 61 in 2018. As many as 156 cases were recorded in the state in 2021 till August 26 this year. Most cases pertained to poaching of endangered animals and reptiles, hunting for meat and illegal trading and possession of horns, tusks, nails, and teeth. Removing tusks or nails and collecting meat from animals that died naturally is also an offence. More than 80% of the total cases registered each year are in connection with poaching of wild animals other than wild boars that cause extensive damage to standing crops. Besides wild boars, sambar deer, spotted deer, porcupines, monitor lizards, pythons, civets and turtles are among those that fall prey to poaching. Occasionally, elephants, leopard, tigers and wild gaurs are also hunted down, say the data. “Since movements were restricted during the Covid period, people living adjacent to forests got more opportunities to engage in poaching. Poachers have also improved their intelligence gathering. The presence of wild animals also increased in the fringe areas, leading to the rise in poaching incidents,” said a member of a flying squad of the forest department. People also lay electric wires to electrocute the animals, besides using poisoning too. Besides killing the animals, depriving them of food is also an offence, as the data show. Among the registered cases, two are in connection with freeing chickens from the mouth of a python forcefully. “For freeing the prey, people might have used force on the python. Moreover, they deprived the python of its food. Even chasing an animal or bird away from its natural habitat is an offence,” said the officer. Felling branches where protected species make nests will also land people in trouble. A case has been registered in Ranni range for destroying the nest of a cormorant, by felling the branches of a tree. The species is placed in schedule 4 of the protected act. Another case pertains to the death of a Hawksbill turtle that was caught in a fishing hook in Pathanapuram range under Punalur division. Despite the surge in poaching, the forest department is yet to conduct a study about the impact of it on wildlife and ecology.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/wildlife-crimes-rise-by-100-in-a-year/articleshow/87836251.cms||T C Sreemol
---||Hyderabad||Will K Chandrasekhar Rao's Delhi trip change political equations in Telangana?||HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Sunday flew to New Delhi to persuade the Centre to announce the target for procurement of rice (paddy) for the ensuing yasangi (rabi) and following seasons from Telangana. Once he is back home, the CM has the crucial responsibility of informing farmers whether they could cultivate paddy in the ensuing yasangi crop season or go for alternate crops. Much would depend upon the stand that would be taken by Centre on its rice (paddy) procurement policy following the CM’s meeting. Political pundits said a policy decision on procurement of rice/paddy by the Centre and the KCR-led TRS in Telangana would have the potential to change political equations in the run up to the 2023 assembly polls. The CM is likely to stay put in New Delhi for at least two days and would be meeting Union ministers for agriculture, food, public distribution, jal shakti among others. Sources told TOI that the CMO has sought an appointment of KCR with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “If the PM-CM meeting happens, we are confident KCR would be able to convince Modi on many issues. He would try to prevail upon the PM to direct FCI to procure 90% of rice (paddy) produced in vaanakalam (kharif) and also clear the air on boiled rice procurement for yasangi,” a senior official said. A couple of ministers accompanied the CM, others along with MPs and senior officials are flying on Monday to join him. Chief secretary Somesh Kumar and TRS MPs are also trying to fix an appointment with Rakesh Tikait-led agitating farmers.  The chief minister has already announced Rs 3 lakh ex gratia each to family members of farmers who died during their year-long agitation farmer. During his visit, KCR would also press for withdrawal of the Electricity (Amendment) Bill to bring in a legislation to back MSP payable to farmers for various crops, to refer the Telangana’s river water sharing issue to the tribunal among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/will-kcr-delhi-trip-change-political-equations-in-t/articleshow/87837513.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Kolkata||Pedestrian island mooted at Chingrighata crossing||Kolkata: Several proposals — from razing the island on the Sector V-bound flank of EM Bypass and turning it into a pedestrian refuge island at Chingrighata crossing to putting up channelizers for people to use an upcoming Foot Over Bridge (FOB) — were made in the wake of a joint survey by Kolkata Traffic Police, IIT-Kharagpur experts, senior KMDA officials and consultants. The survey was conducted with an aim to decongest the Chingrighata crossing and its 500-metre radius. Cops said the survey was a part of their efforts to reduce the number of accidents in this area after chief minister Mamata Banerjee hauled up both Kolkata Police and Bidhannagar City Police at an administrative meeting recently. “An over two-hour inspection was completed and we proposed to IIT Kharagpur to make this a model intersection. They have agreed in principle,” said an officer. According to sources, the changing pedestrian timings are posing a challenge to cops. “The Chingrighata crossing is different from other crossings in the city. Most of those using this crossing belong to lower income brackets and they mostly use cycles. We had 342-372 vehicles getting down from Maa flyover per minute in 2019. At present, the number has gone up to 290-340 vehicles per minute. The construction of a pedestrian island at this cross will help us regulate the traffic flow,” said the officer. Cops have also decided to shut down the slip road near Metropolitan crossing from 9.30pm at night, instead of 10pm, during winter. “We are increasing the number of retro reflective signs that will be visible even during fog. In addition, we are also putting up 14 LED blinkers on the road between Metropolitan Crossing and Chingrighata Crossing,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pedestrian-island-mooted-at-chingrighata-crossing/articleshow/87836994.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Students will start writing the 90-minute multiple choice questions (MCQs) at 2 pm in their respective schools. External examiners have to report to allotted schools by 3 pm. After students leave, the question paper cum answer booklets will be handed over to the examiner/s who will correct it. Like the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), CISCE this academic year has two board exams. CBSE exams for class X and XII are underway. CISCE had initially planned its first boards in the online mode. Students were given the option of writing the online exams from their homes or schools. The Supreme court had on Thursday turned down a petition filed by a group of students seeking the option of taking the exam in a mode of their choice—online or offline. This is the first time students will be attempting MCQs based papers. The paper-cum-answer booklets will be handed over to students at 1.50 pm. They will get 10 minutes to read the questions. Each class will have 12 students, masks will be compulsory for students and invigilators.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Weekend spurt in Eastern Metropolitan Bypass drink-driving prosecutions||KOLKATA: The Eastern Metropolitan Bypass emerged as the new trouble zone for cops with a spike in drink-driving cases on a weekend. The number of such cases almost doubled from that of last week. Traffic cops prosecuted 61 motorists across the city for drink-driving on Friday and Saturday while the number stood at 33 last week. Of the 61 prosecutions, 23 were reported from the 17km Bypass stretch. While the daily average crossed 30 this weekend, the average drink-driving cases on weekdays hover between 13 to 15. The Hiland Park stretch on the Bypass alone saw 10 prosecutions while the Chingrighata Crossing saw another three and the Hudco Crossing saw a couple more on Saturday night. Even four drink-driving cases were reported from Tagore Park and Anandapur Main Road (near Urbana) on the same night. The Girish Park Crossing and the Park Street-Camac Street Crossing reported five prosecutions on Friday. There were nine prosecutions at the Sovabazar Crossing and the Park Street-Loudon Street Crossing on Saturday. “Several pubs have come up along the Bypass, which is well connected with both the Parganas, thus making it a party zone. The results are being seen in the number of prosecutions for drink-driving,” said an officer of Lalbazar. DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha said, “We carried out nakas at 25 points in the city with the help of local cops between 9pm and 10.30pm. We changed our naka positions post 10.30pm. As a result, we could cover 50 spots in one night. Thus, we had 36 prosecutions on Friday and 25 on Saturday,” said another officer. Cops have hinted at intense checks during weekends in the city as the year end approaches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/weekend-spurt-in-bypass-drink-driving-prosecutions/articleshow/87836996.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The deceased were identified as Pulicharla Anil Kumar (20), a resident of Kothapalli under Lingapalem mandal in West Godavari district and the girl, a resident of Lopudi village in Krishna district. Both the man and the girl met each other about a year ago. They developed a relationship and decided to marry. However, the proposal was turned down by both the families. Disappointed over the decision of their parents, both of them decided to end lives. On November 18, Anil Kumar came to Lopudi on his bike and took the girl along with him. They stopped near Uppu Vagu culvert between Kothagudem and Yerravarigudem and consumed pesticide. They informed their aunts about their plan following which their parents rushed to the spot. The parents with the help of Chatrai police spotted the duo who were lying unconscious near the culvert and shifted them to Nuzividu government hospital. After administering first aid, they were shifted to Vijayawada Government General Hospital.

The last date for filing of nominations is November 23. Though a formal announcement on the nominees is likely on Monday , a senior TRS leader told TOI that it is a mixture of old and new faces cleared by the TRS president. Several of the incumbent MLCs have been given tickets again, while KCR has rejected a few due to their poor performance and, instead, has given opportunity to fresh faces. The CM along with his cabinet colleagues finalised the names taking into consideration image of the candidate, work performance, caste equation among other factors. The CM directed the ministers to cajole those who missed the bus not to get dejected and assure them that they would get important posts in future. Former TDP state president L Ramana, who joined TRS before the by-poll to the Huzurabad assembly constituency, has reportedly been finalised from the Karimnagar local authorities constituency. From Nalgonda, MC Koti Reddy has been almost approved. Even Khammam MLC seat is likely to have a new face with T Madhu being the front runner to get the ticket. Likewise, Sai Chand seemed to have found favour with KCR for the Mahbubnagar MLC ticket. The sitting MLCs who are likely to get tickets again are former minister Patnam Mahender Reddy from Ranga Reddy LAC, T Bhanu Prasad Rao from Karimnagar, Kasireddy Narayana Reddy from Mahbubnagar. A clarity on Nizamabad MLC seat is likely to come on Monday. Kalvakuntla Kavitha is the sitting MLC from this seat. If she is sent to Rajya Sabha, Akula Lalitha is the front runner for the seat. There are two MLC LAC seats each in Karimnagar, Mahbubnagar and Rangareddy districts, while one seat each in Adilabad, Warangal, Nalgonda, Medak, Nizamabad and Khammam. The 12 MLCs under local authorities constituencies who would retire on January 4, 2022 include Puranam Satish Kumar (Adilabad), Pochampally Srinivas Reddy (Warangal), Tera Chinnapa Reddy (Nalgonda), V Bhoopal Reddy (Medak), Kalvakuntla Kavitha (Nizamabad), Balasani Laxminarayana (Khammam), T Bhanu Prasad Rao, Naradasu Laxman Rao (Karimnagar), Kasireddy Narayan Reddy, Kuchukalla Damodar Reddy (Mahabubnagar) and Patnam Mahender Reddy and Sunkari Raju (Rangareddy).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mlc-polls-ramana-koti-madhu-among-kcr-picks/articleshow/87837517.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Delhi||First to shut, last to open: A series of crises hurting school education||NEW DELHI: From losing their ability to write, to lack of time management, not following routines, learning to hold test tubes when in Class XII, communicating with friends and deteriorating social skills are among observations educators have made about children who have stayed away from schools due to Covid-19. Even as schools had just started working on addressing these problems, they were closed again due to pollution. Educationists and principals said such repeated disruptions were going to adversely affect the overall growth of children. The schools opened for children of nursery to Class VIII on November 1. Students of senior classes had been attending school since September, though in private schools the attendance was not encouraging. However, many schools managed to conduct Class IX and XI exams offline. Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said, “My teachers say irrespective of what a student’s academic performance is, their learning levels have been affected in different ways and proportions. The truth is that there are learning gaps. Science teachers say they have to teach Class XII students how to hold a test tube. Despite giving them enough practice, it’s still not enough.” Yasumasa Kimura, UNICEF country representative, said their rapid assessment study in October 2020 showed that 76% of parents of children aged 5-13 years and 80% of adolescents aged 14-18 years reported less learning than when physically at school. “Many have regressed in basic counting and other skills. We see increasing evidence on the negative impacts of school closures on children’s learning, safety, health and well-being. The longer children are out of school, the greater the exposure to physical, emotional and sexual violence,” Kimura told TOI. Suruchi Gandhi, principal of Bal Bharti School, Dwarka, said, “When the school reopened, we had planned exams for the junior students to know their learning levels. Now, even the 10-15 students who had agreed for offline exams are going online. Children have become very comfortable with this. They have forgotten to write. All they know is to upload documents quickly.” “Whenever the school reopens, teachers will have to spend at least an hour just to know the emotional level of children. The children have forgotten how to talk to their friends. Children have been visiting malls and markets and even their houses have indoor pollution. I don’t think it is sensible to make such hasty decisions,” added Gandhi. Even parents feel closing schools is just a knee-jerk reaction to the problem that has been around for several years. Dharini Mathur, lawyer and parent of a KG student, said, “For most children, the air is the same at home and school. So, it’s not clear how they are being protected by making them stay at home.” Ameeta Mulla Wattal, chairperson and executive director education, innovations, and training at DLF Foundation School, explained the larger understanding about these disruptions. “It’s believed that we are going to see a harsh winter till January-end. The most affected will be children. Essentially, as a society, we have become intolerant towards any kind of discomfort. Unfortunately, health and education are being impacted. We will see the change in the growth of children after a few years. In the last two years, there has been a great lack of learning that has affected their communication, collaboration and sharing skills,” added Wattal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/first-to-shut-last-to-open-a-series-of-crises-hurting-school-education/articleshow/87836999.cms||Shradha Chettri

The exams were scheduled in two sessions — 10.30am-1pm and 2pm-4.30pm — and for each session, the candidates were instructed to be at the examination hall at least half an hour in advance. The examination is of great importance to the candidates, especially those already serving in educational institutions that have made it mandatory for them to clear the exam, and also because this is the first exam after a gap of two years. The previous exams had to be postponed due to the pandemic. The candidates were seen making desperate efforts and even engaging in verbal fights with the local authorities and police officials claiming that they could not get any transportation due to the MSRTC staff strike. and praying for the entry into the centres all of which went into vain. Frustrated, the candidates even sought re-examination, though no such formal demand was made with the nodal officer of the examination till Sunday evening. “I started from Nandgaon at 5 am and got here by hitch-hiking — first from my native place to the highway, then to the taluka place, to Manmad and finally to Nashik — in the absence of a bus service. I reached the examination centre just two minutes late,” said Bhusan Sonawane, an aspirant from Nandgaon. Similarly, Ashwini Pagare and few others, who started from Akole, Sangamner and Kopargaon talukas of Ahmednagar district, managed to reach Nashik, but failed to make it on time. Travelling from Vani in Kalwan taluka to Nashik takes two hours. Sandeep Bahiram started at 5 am. He got a lift on a two-wheeler for a distance and walked a few kilometre. Then he boarded a truck to reach Nashik at 9.30 am. “I knew there could be some issues, and planned to reach Nashik well in time,” said Bahiram. There were others who came in groups by booking vehicles — for their journey to the exam centre in Nashik and back. Examinations were conducted in 43 centres in the city and 24,941 candidates out of 28,721 appeared for the examination. Rajeev Mhaskar, the education officer for Nashik ZP, who was the nodal officer for the exams, said the candidates were aware of the MSRTC strike and they should have planned accordingly. “We have not received any complaint or representation about the issues faced by the candidates while travelling. If and when we receive such a complaint, we will send it to the government,” Mhaskar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/delayed-by-st-strike-many-tet-candidates-miss-exams/articleshow/87837003.cms||Abhilash Botekar

I had noticed a slight change in her behaviour and so I had asked the staff to examine her and immediately started treating her injury,” said Pratyush Patankar, zoo curator. However, when Gael didn’t show much improvement in her health, Patankar contacted the Anand Veterinary College which sent a team to examine the big cat. “A small surgery was done on November 11 following which she started eating some solid food again. Tests revealed that her creatinine levels were very high at that time, but still she survived. On Saturday too, the lioness ate some chicken but succumbed on Sunday morning. Investigation revealed that she had suffered renal failure,” Patankar added. The zoo authorities have been planning to get a pair of male and female lion cubs from Junagadh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/13-year-old-lioness-dies-of-renal-failure-in-sayajibaug-zoo/articleshow/87836286.cms||---

Both arts and science, after all, are creative endeavours. You are exploring the creativity of the human mind, whether it is done through music, painting or dance form or through science and experiments. In today’s world, you need skills from both sides,” said Bhattacharya. While the concept of STEAM has become popular in the west, in India it is yet to catch up, he said. The talks will be scheduled on the second Sunday of every month and the topics will be picked by the HBCSE community. It could range from environmental issues, to design, to standard science, and math education.  The team will also be making shorter videos in multiple languages.

Bharadwaj said that the corporations are “bringing shame” to Delhiitess with the north corporation ranking 45th, EDMC 40th and SDMC 31st among 48 municipal corporations of the country. “This is extremely shameful for Delhi, the capital of the nation,” Bharadwaj said. “For the last six years, they have maintained the name of Delhi in the list of the dirtiest cities in the country,” he added. “If BJP cannot do even sweeping, then they have no right to remain in office. There is no right to run a corporation steeped in corruption in this manner,” he alleged. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that there is no doubt that Delhi's ranking in sanitation survey is not satisfactory, but asked what cooperation Delhi government has given to municipal bodies to improve the sanitation standards. He claimed that the state government has withheld funds, which is affecting the corporations’ development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/swachh-ranks-expose-graft-in-corpns-aap/articleshow/87837002.cms||---

State Congress president and Malkajgiri MP A Revanth Reddy on Sunday said how could anyone trust KCR when the TRS government has not paid ex gratia to the family of Telangana martyrs. “After extending ex gratia to a few, the government has washed its hands off.

The action came after the Delhi-based company finalised to take over ISBT Mohali offered lesser compensation. Gmada chief administrator Vipul Ujwal said, “We have filed an appeal before the NCLT as we are major stakeholders and had leased out land to the company. We are now planning to be part of the process, act as bidder and run the project on our own.” According to him, Mahakaram builders, who were finalised to take over the project offered very less compensation to all stakeholders, including Gmada. In 2019, the special bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) initiated corporate insolvency resolution process of C&C Towers Limited of ISBT Mohali. NCLT appointed KPMG international as Resolution Professional (RP) to settle the claims of the financial creditors, including banks, buyers and public allottees from C&C Towers. On the other hand, more than 300 buyers, who had invested around Rs 100 crore to buy commercial properties at Mohali bus terminal-cum-commercial complex (Mohali Junction) since 2010 said that the Gmada was taking the issue lightly and despite Punjab and Haryana High Court directions, police had not taken much action. Jasdeep Singh, president of C&C Mohali Junction Clients Association said, “It is sad that Gmada is not taking the issue seriously. We want the commercial part of the bus stand to be made operational so that we may get return on our investments.” He added that most of the stakeholders had started depositing their money, ranging from Rs 25 lakh to Rs 1 crore, in 2010. In 2009, Gmada signed an agreement with C&C Towers with the assurance that the project would be completed in 30 months. However, more than eight years on, the commercial towers have not been completed, though the bus terminal has become operational. In December 2019, Mohali police arrested Sanjay Gupta, one of the directors of C&C Company, from Delhi. Lookout circulars have been issued against chairman Gurjeet Singh Johar along with directors Charanbir Singh Sethi and Sanjay Gupta after police failed to arrest them. In September 2019, the Punjab State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, Chandigarh issued non-bailable warrants (NBWs) and lookout notices against the chairman and chief general manager of C&C Towers constructing Baba Banda Singh Bahadur Interstate Terminus in Mohali. BOX The troubled project The ambitious busopolis project was launched in 2009 and was to be completed in December 2011. Spread over seven acres, it was to have an inter-state bus terminal, three multi-storey towers with retail and office spaces, multiplex, five-star hotel, banquet hall, hyper markets, and a helipad on top of one tower. However, ever since its inception, the project has been mired in controversies and possession delays. While the bus terminal has become operational, the commercial towers are yet to be completed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/gmada-seeks-iclt-nod-to-isbt-mohali-operations/articleshow/87837004.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

As per the BEE, growth in the population is driving the energy demand northwards. During a webinar conducted with all SDAs, the director general of BEE, Abhay Bakre, urged the states to formulate separate action plans, keeping the local conditions in mind to promote energy conservation and efficiency in their respective states. He also requested the states to fully involve in this national movement of energy conservation and carry out innovative awareness programmes. “Reducing the wastage of energy is very crucial and people need to be made aware of the best practices regarding it. Using energy in an efficient manner is necessary to save it for future needs and development of the country. The pace with the non-replenishable sources is depleting is a major cause of concern around the world,” said Bakre. The DG-BEE added energy conservation should be rooted in the behaviour of every human being to get more effect towards the plan of energy conservation. “There is a need to involve every citizen of India in energy conservation and efficiency and let them be aware that it is the responsibility of everyone in the country,” said Bakre. BEE appreciated Andhra Pradesh for its objective to involve one crore women from self-help groups and students in the energy efficiency activities through Society for Elimination of Rural Poverty (SERP) and education department. As per the official statement issued by the chief executive officer, Andhra Pradesh State Energy Conservation Mission, A Chandrasekhar Reddy, the steps taken by BEE to save energy in various key sectors including industry have yielded excellent results and attracted global attention. “The industrial sector in the country saved 21.95 million tonnes of oil equivalent worth Rs Rs 40,945 crores by implementing the Perform Achieve Trade (PAT) scheme (cycle-1 and 2). Energy conservation building code is also one of the best programmes to promote energy efficiency at ground level. Energy conservation is an effort to reduce the consumption of energy and to use the least energy so that energy sources can be saved for future generations,” said Chandrasekhar Reddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/bee-asks-states-to-form-energy-strategies/articleshow/87836288.cms||---

HC gave them the relief after pointing out that though they were accused of a nefarious and depraved offence, since the evidence was primarily documentary in nature and was already in the custody of the police, no useful purpose would be served in keeping them in jail. “It is a settled law that the magnitude of the offence cannot be the only criterion for denying bail. The object of bail is to secure the presence of the accused at the trial. The object of bail is neither punitive nor preventative and the person who has not been convicted should be held in custody pending trial only to ensure his attendance at trial; and to ensure that the evidence is not tampered with and the witnesses are not threatened,” Justice Subramonium Prasad observed, granting bail to Mohan Kumar Jha, Mohd Shoiab Khan, Pushkar Chandrakant Pakhale and Aditya Gautam. They were in custody for seven months and were given bail on furnishing a personal band of Rs 1 lakh each with two sureties of the like amount. HC directed them not to leave the capital without prior court permission and to report to the police station concerned thrice a week and not to tamper with the evidence or contact any witnesses. According to the prosecution, during the second Covid wave in April, the crime branch received inputs of illegal hoarding and supply of life-saving medicines, including remdesivir, to treat coronavirus patients. The police said it got a tip-off that two of the accused would supply remdesivir injections near Batra Hospital and apprehended them. They were unable to produce any prescription for the medicines in their possession. It said other accused were also nabbed in same manner from other places and, at the time of the arrest of one of the accused people, empty vials, vial caps and a batch coding machine, which was apparently used for the production of fake remdesivir injection labels, were also seized. The accused sought bail on the ground that they were lodged in judicial custody for seven months and a chargesheet had been filed and that no useful purpose would be served by keeping them in jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-gives-bail-to-4-who-hoarded-covid-drugs-during-second-wave/articleshow/87837024.cms||---

During Diwali, the MSEDCL had stopped taking action against defaulters, but the officials re-launched the disconnection drive after a gap of five days during which the action was taken. More than 60% of the connections were reinstated after the consumers settled their dues by paying the outstanding amount along with penalty and charges in addition to the principal outstanding. A senior official from the MSEDCL said there were about 6.8 lakh consumers in the district that owed the power utility Rs 121 crore — most of which were residential consumers. “The industrial consumers have higher bills, but they generally settle them in total two months and similar is the case of commercial consumers who need to settle dues to keep their business and trade moving,” he said. “There are residential consumers who are not settling their dues despite our interventions and appeals even after three months due to which the action was taken,” he added. The official also pointed out that action against industrial as well as commercial consumers was also being carried out. “The action is targeted against all types of consumers. So far, power supply to 3,990 had been snapped and action against the rest of the consumers is also being carried out,” the official said.“There was no action being carried out against the agriculture consumers as of now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/msedcl-cuts-power-supply-to-3990-consumers-in-nashik-after-diwali/articleshow/87837019.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The caches were confiscated from Morbi and Devbhoomi-Dwarka districts. The four accused include a Nigerian national living in Delhi. The ATS said the arrested persons are Haji Sanghar, 50, and his son Maheboob Sanghar, 27, from Devbhoomi-Dwarka; Raheem Node, 35, from Jamnagar; and Michael Christian, the Nigerian from Delhi. Haji and Maheboob had allegedly ventured into Pakistani waters to receive the heroin. They brought it to the Salaya coast with Node’s help, the ATS said. Christian had paid Rs 30 lakh for some quantity of the heroin to a wanted accused, Isa Rav, through an angadia firm, said the ATS. The squad has so far caught 11 persons in the case. The consignment was taken on the instruction of Rav, the ATS said. His brother Mukhtar Hussein from Jamnagar, Ghulam Bhagad from Salaya in Devbhoomi-Dwarka, and Shamshuddin Saiyyed from Morbi were arrested on November 14 for possessing a part of the consignment. The cache was found in the house of Saiyyed. It was allegedly brought from a Pakistani drug lord, Zahid Bashir Baloch. About 12kg was to be given to the aides of a jailed sharpshooter, Bharatbhusan Sharma alias Bhola Shooter — Ankit Jakhad and Arvind Yadav. The 12kg was to be delivered to the two by a Jamnagar resident, Iqbal Qadri. When Qadri went to deliver the drugs, a team of the ATS caught him and Yadav on September 17. Mukhtar Hussein told the cops that a part of the consignment of 24kg was kept at the house of Anwar Patelia at Navadra village in Devbhoomi-Dwarka district. An ATS team seized the consignment, worth Rs 120 crore, on November 17 and arrested Patelia the next day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/144kg-drug-haul-4-more-arrested/articleshow/87837018.cms||---
---||Pune||Societies, residential areas prone to vehicle thefts: Cops||PUNE: A study carried out by the city police department has found that housing societies’ parking lots and residential areas are the most vulnerable to vehicle thefts, contrary to the impression that vehicles parked on public roads are stolen most often. Housing societies, particularly those in the fringes and in isolated areas, with no security guards and CCTV surveillance, are often targeted by vehicle thieves, police said. Similarly, in slum pockets (read “residential areas”), people are forced to park their vehicles on roads, leading to thefts. Among the five city police zonal units, Zone 5, which covers Hadapsar, Kondhwa, Mundhwa, and Wanowrie, among other areas, has reported 401 vehicle theft cases between Till October 31 this year. This is twice the total number of vehicle thefts reported from the other four zones. A total of 1,186 vehicle thefts have been reported till October 31 this year. Last year, 975 vehicle thefts were reported (fewer on account of the lockdown), while 1,677 vehicle thefts were reported in 2019. “Residential areas means housing societies and slum pockets in and around the city,” deputy commissioner of police (crime) Shrinivas Ghadge explained, adding, “Slum residents do not have proper parking facilities and so, their vehicles are easy targets. Similarly, housing societies on the fringes do not employ security guards, nor do they have CCTV cameras. It becomes easy for thieves.” Since January 2019, 1,512 vehicles have been stolen from residential areas, while 1,405 vehicles were stolen from public roads, police said. The other spots from where such thefts were reported were private offices, public places (gardens, government offices, etc), state transport bus stands, hospitals, temples, schools and colleges, commercial complexes, and banks/ATMs). “The highest number of cases is reported from Zone V because of its vast expanse and rapidly developing area. Secondly, Zone IV too has such complaints and it too has many developing areas, commercial activities, and housing societies in far-flung places,” he said. The old part of the city, which used to report a high number of vehicle thefts about a decade ago, now has fewer cases. “Zone I is showing a declining trend in the number of cases because security concerns among residents is high and people have installed CCTV cameras on their society premises, employed security guards and have adopted other security measures,” Ghadge said. Police have identified 67 points in the city wherefrom repeatedly vehicles have been reported stolen. “There are over 25 criminals who regularly steal vehicles and have been repeatedly arrested,” Ghadge said. Thieves either steal vehicles and sell them in the rural parts of the district, and Marathwada and North Maharashtra regions, or they are stripped for parts and sold to garage operators. In some cases, vehicles are stolen for joyrides. “In case of joy rides, vehicles are stolen from the roads and used until their fuel is exhausted; they are then abandoned on the road,” the deputy commissioner said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/societies-residential-areas-prone-to-vehicle-thefts-cops/articleshow/87837028.cms||Gitesh Shelke

The ghat section connects Pune-Bhor to Mahad taluka and sees hundreds of daily travellers. Atul Chavan, superintending engineer of the PWD’s Pune circle, told TOI on Sunday that a proposal to clear the route has been sent to the state government but a response is awaited. The department has cleared debris partially at some places, making a provision for a narrow carriageway. “Work to clean debris could not be executed properly due to continuous rain and closure of the ghat in August,” said an official from the Bhor PWD. According to Bhor activist Sachin Deshmukh, the debris must be cleared urgently. “Vehicular movement has been high ever since the reopening of the industrial activities in Pune and Raigad district,” said Deshmukh. Another PWD official said the road has caved in at several locations, and small bridges and safety railings have been damaged due to the heavy rain and landslides in the ghat areas. “We need at least Rs20 crore to carry out all this work. We have mentioned all these aspects in our proposal,” said the official. Villagers, particularly from Hirdoshi, Varvand, Shirgaon, and Umbade, have been affected as there is no other route to reach Bhor town. According to Vijay Jadhav, another Bhor activist, several heavy vehicles from the industrial areas of Raigad take the ghat section to reach Pune district. “Often, they get trapped due to the narrow carriageway. Shifting the vehicle can take up to five hours, leaving many stranded,” said Jadhav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/uncleared-debris-in-varandha-ghat-a-hazard-for-travellers/articleshow/87837037.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Vijayawada||SS report hails state’s Covid-19 ‘mobile’ care||Visakhapatnam: Andhra Pradesh utilised mobile Covid-19 centres to screen the suspected Covid-19 cases during the peak of both first and second waves. These mobile centres were parked at state borders and key areas of public transit such as railway stations and airports to cover the high risk areas. These ‘intelligent monitoring analysis services quarantine’ (I-MASQ) buses of state have found a mention in the Swachh Survekshan (SS) -2021 report, which was released on Saturday. At one point last year, about 120 state-owned Vera and APSRTC buses served as swab collection centres After overcoming the odds of no testing facilities in the initial weeks into the outbreak in February-March 2020, the state stuck to the scientific grounding of aggressive testing despite the growing infection numbers. For the same, the state leveraged various new testing modalities and facilities, as and when validated by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Right from carrying out the antibody tests in the beginning to the gold standard RT-PCR tests, the state enhanced its testing footprint through rapid antigen tests, HIV viral load testing labs, CBNAAT (cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test) machines, converting buses into mobile sample collection centres, etc. The majority of the tests conducted so far in Andhra Pradesh were done through the RT-PCR mechanism. The ‘I-MASQ’ buses were introduced with an objective of making the then mandatory testing process at the airports and railway stations simpler, which otherwise had become cumbersome due to the waiting time of five to six hours. The Swachh Survekshan-2021 report also highlighted contactless delivery of all the services such as door-to-door ration and pension distribution during phase one of the lockdown. The state conducted nearly 30 rounds of door-to-door fever survey in both the waves to identify suspected cases and start early treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ss-report-hails-states-covid-19-mobile-care/articleshow/87836336.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Supply is expected to be affected on Monday too as the leakage in the 1,800mm Tansa east water main line at Mahim Creek has not been arrested completely, said officials. “We had completed the work, but realised that the leakage had not been arrested completely. There was no point depressurizing it again, so water was supplied on Sunday although the pressure was very low. On Monday, we will again take up work on arresting the leakage,” a hydraulic department official said. Madhu Poplai, of Pali Hill Residents’ Association, complained that many societies were forced to pay exorbitant rates for water tankers. “Some were asking for up to Rs 7,000 for one tanker. Besides there was up to seven hours of waiting for a tanker,” said Poplai. There are two mains at Mahim Creek, Tansa east and Tansa west, said Bandra corporator Asif Zakaria. “These water mains have outlived their lifespan and are corroded. The BMC should have fixed this problem as leakages are affecting citizens.” Khar corporator Swapna Mhatre said that the BMC should have taken up the work on a war footing to ensure that people are not hassled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-water-supply-in-bandra-khar-to-be-hit-today-too/articleshow/87837806.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Mumbai||Born in a stable, BMC dental hospital set for major upgrade||MUMBAI: The 88-year-old Nair Dental College in Mumbai Central is set to get one of its biggest upgrades in decades. A new 11-storey building that will house more students, more operation theatres, simulation labs and in-patient wards is nearing completion. It is expected to be operational early next year.  The BMC-run Nair Dental College is the only other dedicated teaching institute and hospital besides the Government Dental College, CST, to cater exclusively to the city’s dental needs. The hospital recorded a footfall of up to 3.5 lakh patients annually in its outpatient department in pre-Covid days. “Nair Dental currently ranks third in India and we intend to take it higher,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, adding that it could be inaugurated in December. The project began in 2018.  The direct and most critical outcome of the upgrade is the multiplication of the BDS (Bachelor of Dental Surgery) seats, said dean Dr Neelam Andrade. BDS is the equivalent of MBBS in dentistry and the college could increase the number of seats from existing 75 to 100. “We have the space now to comfortably accommodate 100 chairs and adequate infrastructure to support hands-on training,” she said.  It is notable that the institute had made a humble beginning in a stable inside the Topiwala National Medical College (BYL Nair Hospital) with a single dental chair in 1933. The BMC formally took over the institute in 1946. The institute is currently functioning from an 8-storey building that was operationalised in 1951. The new building project is being executed at a cost of over Rs 104 crore.  The facility will have two modular operation theatres, three classrooms, mini-auditorium and 25-bed wards. Private wards with attached toilets have also been created. An isolation room has also been added to the set-up for the first time. Pre-clinical labs for teaching purposes, including simulation labs will be housed in the new building.  Dr Andrade said that the expansion will give the doctors a leg-up in strengthening precancerous oral treatment, fracture of face and jaws, orbital fractures and reconstruction of jaws. “Despite the ban on smokeless tobacco such as gutka and pan masala, we continue to see a high number of pre-cancerous fibrosis, where the person has difficulty opening the mouth,” she added.  Andrade said that with the Metro connectivity coming up to the hospital’s doorstep, the patient flow is only expected to multiply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/born-in-a-stable-bmc-dental-hospital-set-for-major-upgrade/articleshow/87837810.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The victim filed a complaint application with the Pune cyber police and underlined that he had never been to Goa and neither had he availed any loan from there. After verification, the cyber police on Saturday referred the case to the Sahakarnagar police for registration of an FIR. When contacted on Sunday afternoon, the victim told TOI, “I will speak with the media after obtaining consent from my legal advisor. For now, I have nothing to say about the case.” A senior cyber police officer, who was part of the verification process, told TOI, “We have traced a bank account in Goa where the loan amount was disbursed and have forwarded all these details to the Sahakarnagar police for further investigation.” Senior inspector Swati Desai of the Sahakarnagar police told TOI, “The victim was not aware when and how his PAN card details were misused. Our team will visit Goa to investigate the account where the loan amount was disbursed and all the related details.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-residents-pan-used-to-get-rs-8-6l-loan-from-pvt-bank-in-goa/articleshow/87837059.cms||Gitesh Shelke

---||Delhi||Delhi: Construction can resume, schools stay shut; truck entry ban extended||NEW DELHI: The ban on construction activities in the capital has been lifted effective Monday. Schools will, however, remain closed till further orders, while the ban on entry of trucks, except those carrying essential commodities, has been extended till November 26. The ban on construction and demolition activities, imposed by the Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas, came to an end on Sunday. However, the Delhi environment department issued fresh orders to control vehicular pollution. All offices of the Delhi government, autonomous bodies and corporations will remain closed till November 26, except those involved in essential and emergency services. However, all the employees will work from home. In its order, the environment department has advised all private offices to allow their staff to work from home. “The violation of the order issued under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, or the rules made there of, shall be punishable under Section 15 of the said Act, which includes imprisonment of up to five years or with fine may extend to Rs 1 lakh, or both,” the order stated. In a circular issued on Sunday, the Delhi government’s Directorate of Education said all schools will remain closed till further orders in view of the air quality situation. The circular, however, stated that online teaching and the examinations for Board classes would be conducted as per the guidelines issued earlier. Schools in Delhi for junior students had opened on November 1. However, students in private school returned only from November 8. A week into the move, the schools were shut again due to the rising pollution levels. Principals say such continuous disruptions will hamper the momentum of students returning to school after 19 months, since they first closed in March due to Covid. “Slowly, the parents were gaining confidence about sending their children (to schools). Now that has again been disrupted. The students' overall development will be affected," said Tania Joshi, principal, The Indian School.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/construction-can-resume-schools-stay-shut-truck-entry-ban-extended/articleshow/87837067.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Jaipur||Jaipur set to face tough challenges in next swachh survey||JAIPUR: After a poor show in the Swachh Survekshan 2021, Jaipur will face a tough challenge in the coming years to boost sanitation condition. Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) Heritage has ranked 32nd and Jaipur Municipal Corporation, Greater, got the 36th position among urban local bodies with a population of over 40 lakh in Swachh Survekshan 2021. Guidelines in 2022 have taken a step forward and now total marks will be 7,500 in which citizen’s voice – 30%, service level progress – 40%, and certification – 30%. The service level programme will include segregated collection, processing and disposal, sustainabile sanitation, and safaimitra suraksha. Jaipur is yet to properly implement door-to-door garbage collection in the city and waste segregation is a distant dream. Councillors in both Jaipur Municipal Corporation – Greater and Heritage have been complaining that hoopers are coming twice a week in most areas. Sustainable sanitation also includes – banning plastic bags which are in use despite being officially banned. There are no adequate facilities for the disposal of waste. Sewapura and Mathuradaspura have become the biggest landfill sites in the state where thousands of tons of garbage have captured acres of area impacting the lives of people living around. JMC-Greater mayor Sheel Dhabai assured that this year, the sanitation condition of the city will improve. “This year the central government will soon release some funds under Swachhta Bharat Abhiyan and we will purchase new hoopers, a mechanised garbage collection system and new sanitation workers will be appointed in every ward. We are already fed up with the BVG company and want to remove it. We will soon be done away with the problems,” said Dhabai. Deputy mayor Puneet Karnawat has blamed the state government for discriminating against JMC, Greater and asked for better support this year. In JMC, Heritage, mayor Munesh Gurjar said that their priority will be to curb the plastic bags and start a Swachhta campaign in the corporation. One of the important fields JMC – Greater, and Heritage lost marks was citizen feedback in which corporations lost 40% marks. More than 500 notices have been given to the BVG company but despite that, the work of the company hasn’t improved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jaipur-faces-tough-challenge-in-next-swachh-survey/articleshow/87837072.cms||---
---||Delhi||Around 541 private buses to be out on roads from today as anti-pollution step in Delhi||NEW DELHI: There would be more than 7,000 buses available for commuters on Monday morning, with 541 private buses hitting Delhi’s streets under the ‘Paryavaran Bus Service’. With the capital battling severe air pollution, transport minister Kailash Gahlot had recently announced that Delhi government is going to hire around 1,000 private buses to augment the city’s public transport fleet. A public notice was issued on Thursday for engagement of private buses and contact details of regional managers of Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC), which would be operating this service, was provided. Till Thursday, total 723 private buses were engaged under the service, out of which 541 would start plying from Monday, an official said. These private buses, which include school buses, buses with All-India Tourist Permit, chartered buses etc., have mostly contract carriage permits, which allows them to transport passengers from one point to another, without picking up or dropping passengers on the way. “These 541 buses had come by Saturday and special stage carriage permits have been issued to these so that the buses can operate on DTC’s routes and pick and drop passengers from the designated bus stops,” he said. “The rest of the buses would be issued similar special permits on Monday and by Tuesday, more than 700 private buses would start operating,” he said. “The response from the bus operators had been very good and the reason behind this was the meeting the transport department had with operators before a public notice was issued,” he said. Transport officials said that DTC, which was chalking out the routes and would manage the operations, was told to be flexible with the arrangements so that an adequate number of private buses could be arranged. Sources said that most of the demands of the bus operators, such as flexible timings for school buses, minimum assured kilometres of operations etc., had been met. “The buses would be assigned routes and an almost equal number of buses would be deployed in north, east, west and south zones. Though more buses would be deployed on trunk routes that see more passenger traffic, the buses would be proportionally deployed so that every part of the city was adequately catered to,” a DTC official said on condition of anonymity. “The buses would have DTC’s signage on the windshield and would have display boards on front and sides mentioning that these were plying under Paryavaran Bus Service. The private operators would provide the drivers, but the buses would have our conductors,” he said, adding that the private buses would have to report to the depot assigned to them every morning. Gahlot had earlier said that the buses were being deployed as an emergency measure for a month to augment public transport in the city. During the odd-even road rationing schemes since 2016, the government had been engaging private buses under ‘Paryavaran Sewa’ to augment public transport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/around-541-private-buses-to-be-out-on-roads-from-today-as-anti-pollution-step/articleshow/87837069.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Apart from the surging yield, the quality of water drawn from the Kollidam would improve as water replenishing will dilute the residues that were causing water decolourisation. The drinking water needs of Trichy city was pegged at 135 MLD (Million Litres per Day) on normal days. The demand is met by eight headworks situated on the river bed of the Kollidam and Cauvery. While water flow will be copious in the Cauvery during most of the annual northeast monsoon, the Kollidam river bed, the flood carrier of Cauvery delta districts, rarely witnesses substantial flow. While the Cauvery accounts for 40% of the drinking water needs of the city, the Kollidam that addresses 60% of the water needs of the city had caused troubles in the past three years as there was a fall in the yield pushing the civic body to pursue contingency measures. At present, Kollidam is recording a flow of more than 10,000 cusecs of water. The quantum was slated as sufficient enough to recharge the borewells in Trichy Corporation. “Considering the storage capacity of Mettur dam and the rainfall forecast in the catchment areas, we expect the flow to continue. The ensuing summer can be managed quite comfortably,” an official with Trichy Corporation said. Even as the yield has improved, the civic body said that as the demand continues to stay below 135 MLD now in the city. So the drawing quantum remains unchanged. A similar water flow in the rivers in 2015 had helped the civic body manage the following summer season’s drinking water needs, the officials recalled. “The fall in groundwater table on the Kollidam river bed was also impacting the water quality due to the high iron residues. Such issues will subside as the recharging of water will dilute the iron content that causes a colour change in the potable water,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/copious-flow-in-rivers-to-fulfil-trichys-drinking-water-needs/articleshow/87837555.cms||Deepak Karthik

As a part of the proposal, the service roads of the RoB interlinking Chennai, Madurai, Dindigul national highways and city roads are slated to be overhauled.State highways sources said that they are in talks with the office of the defence estate officer in Chennai to sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the state government and the defence ministry. The MoU is mandatory to complete the land transfer and cater to the demands of the defence ministry that sought equal value infrastructure in exchange for the Rs 8.45 crore worth defence land in Mannarpuram.“Not waiting for the MoU to materialise, we floated the tender to complete the pending work. Within a month, we will identify a suitable agency to execute the civil work,” an official with the state highways said. The project division of the state highways will complete the hanging Chennai arm and construct a compound wall of the defence property near the RoB. The cost of the pending work is estimated at Rs 3 crore. The 12-metre wide lanes of the RoB must be extended further by 134 metres after the defence ministry officially cedes the property. “The rain-ravaged service roads of the RoB will also be overhauled as five years have passed since they were laid,” the official said.The highways department is likely to launch the pending work in January next year and to complete it by around April 2022. A 7-metre wide service road would come up adjacent to the Chennai arm to help the vehicles approaching from Madurai-Trichy-Chennai NH to reach E Pudur and Crawford localities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/sh-dept-floats-tender-to-wrap-up-rob-work/articleshow/87837554.cms||---

Many farmers are selling chicken in the open market at a lower price to avoid huge losses. The Telugu month of Karthika is considered very auspicious. Hindus believe that one should practise non-violence during this month and stay away from eating non-vegetarian food. As a result, consumption of chicken, mutton, fish and other non-vegetarian food fell all of a sudden. Chicken which cost Rs 295 per kg on November 5 has plummeted to Rs 190 per kg. “Chicken price remained stable for last three months. Consumption also increased after Covid-19 second wave as people preferred protein-rich food. Sale usually comes down in Karthika month by 30 per cent. But we are witnessing abnormal fall in prices this year. I personally own around 2,000 birds and it is becoming tough for me to bear the expenses of feeding them. It usually costs Rs 160 per kg for live birds at farm, but we are getting only Rs 110 per kg now,” said M Chalama Rao, a poultry farmer from Agiripalli. “Government should intervene and announce subsidies for poultry farmers to help us recover from the losses. Fish markets across the city wore a deserted look on Sunday due to the impact of Karthika maasam. Meanwhile, chicken shops and eateries selling non-veg dishes are offering huge discounts to attract the consumers. “Chicken price fell significantly but still there is no response from buyers. I have started offering Rs 30 discount per kg on chicken. Hope everything will be normal from the next month,” said K Rambabu who runs a chicken shop at Mahanti market in city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/auspicious-karthika-month-takes-toll-on-poultry-farmers/articleshow/87836372.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Gangster Chhota Shakeel’s aide set up honeytrap for businessman using former wife||MUMBAI: A fresh case of extortion was registered against gangster Chhota Shakeel’s aide, Riyaz Bhatti, by Mumbai Police on Saturday. Bhatti, against whom Mumbai Police have initiated a process to declare him an absconder along with former police commissioner Param Bir Singh in an extortion case, has now been accused of setting up a honeytrap to blackmail a businessman. Bhatti allegedly sent a woman to entertain the businessman and later made video clips of the two together. The victim, a 44- year-old jeweller, lodged a complaint with Versova police, who on Saturday registered a fresh case of extortion against Bhatti. The complainant said he met Bhatti through Sanjay Saini, a common friend, and was impressed as he had taken him to Bhatti’s office and shown him pictures with influential personalities. Last January, Bhatti introduced the victim to a woman and told him she would entertain him if he paid Rs 1 lakh.  The complainant showed interest and the trio met at a three-star hotel in the western suburbs. Saini, Bhatti and the complainant went to a hotel room where they danced in a state of undress. The victim paid Rs 1 lakh to Bhatti to pay the woman. “Two days later Bhatti told the complainant the woman was threatening to complain of sexual assault. Bhatti started threatening and blackmailing the complainant for Rs 25 lakh,’’ said an officer. The victim said he would take time to arrange it. Bhatti allegedly told him that he would pay the woman and he should pay him later, to which the complainant agreed.  Two months later Saini told the complainant the woman wanted to talk to him. She told him to meet her at Sun-n-Sand hotel in Juhu. When they met, the woman said she was Bhatti’s divorced wife and he sent her to honeytrap him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-shakeel-aide-set-up-honeytrap-for-bizman-using-former-wife/articleshow/87837827.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Chennai||Why Tamil Nadu’s child rights policy misses the mark||By Vanessa Peter CHENNAI: On World Children’s Day (November 20), chief minister of Tamil Nadu M K Stain introduced the state policy for children nearly eight years after the inception of the national policy for children in 2013. This policy is introduced in a critical period, when children are facing difficulties in accessing education because of the pandemic situation that has exposed the widening digital divide in the country. Since March 2020, there has also been a rise in the number of crimes against children, including child marriage and child sexual abuse. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report, crimes against children in TN increased by 4.8% in 2020 when compared to the marginal decline of 0.4% between 2018 and 2019. Access to justice not addressed While the policy is a welcome step, access to justice continues to be a challenge, especially in cases filed under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, 2012. The low conviction rate in Pocso cases continues to be a challenge in Tamil Nadu. The conviction rate in Pocso cases is 25.4% as on 2019 as per the data released by the ministry of women and child development. For field practitioners, accessing justice for survivors of child sexual abuse is a continuous struggle against delay in filing chargesheet, lack of sensitivity among officials and slow trial process. For instance, a seven-year-old girl, who faced sexual abuse, had to undergo medical examination in a gynecological ward where pregnant women were delivering children. She was referred to as ‘Pocso case’ by staff at the hospital. She was kept in an isolated ward and visits to the court, which is not child-friendly, further added to her trauma. Continuing to reside in the same block as the accused in a cramped Tamil Nadu Urban Habitat Development Board tenement, during the pandemic made the situation worse for the child. The absence of a rehabilitation scheme that includes access to psychosocial support, protection from intimidation, education, employment support for the parent, and access to shelter/housing for the family of the survivor are other issues, especially when the family is from an economically weaker section. Though these challenges have called for strengthening the monitoring of Pocso cases in TN, the state policy has no reference to Pocso. On the contrary, the Sexual Harassment of Women at Work Place (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, that is applicable for protecting working women from sexual harassment at workplace is mentioned, pertaining to teachers. In the age of digital threats to children, the policy has no mention of crimes such as cyber bullying or child pornography. Bullying in schools, though, was recognised as an issue by the school education department. The idea was to start an online portal for reporting unsafe activities in schools and formation of anti-bullying task forces, but there is no mention of the same in the policy. Urban children left out With the aim to create awareness about democracy and finding one’s voice, the state policy mentions creation of bala sabha in all gram panchayats enhancing participation of children in the democratic processes. However, in TN the policy is restricted to bala sabhas in rural areas. Since 48% of Tamil Nadu’s population lives in urban areas, nearly half of the children (35,12,530 children, as per census 2011) would be left out of the participatory democratic process. Kerala, which was the pioneer in introducing the bala sabha model, also has bala nagarasabhas functioning in the urban areas to make the model all-inclusive. Participation of children is a key solution for addressing some of the social and civic issues in urban areas. In 2019, the Safe Spaces campaign, a participatory exercise facilitated by the Information and Resource Centre for the Deprived Urban Communities in different informal settlements, revealed that children had identified requirements for facilities like streetlights, playgrounds, parks and wider roads in their neighbourhood. There were instances where children pointed out that there was no rainwater harvesting facilities in the houses constructed by the government. Providing a platform for children to express their opinions and concerns not only addresses gaps in facilities, but also enhances their capacities. Way forward To facilitate better access to justice, the policy should spell out the specific roles of the key stakeholders like the police, public prosecutors, medical professionals, and judiciary in the policy domain. Key issues like portrayal of children in the media remain unaddressed. Such misses may have been avoided if the voices of the public were taken into account. While drafting the policy, the social welfare and women empowerment department has not divulged public information about the policy formulation process and the draft was not made available in the public domain for broader consultation,thereby restricting the scope for strengthening the policy. In a democratic country, policies concerning the welfare of the people should be made available in the public domain for availing comments and suggestions before finalising it. The policy must include a legal, regulatory, institutional, and resource allocation framework, which is crucial for strengthening the multi-sectorial collaboration envisioned in the policy. Though the policy mentions allocating adequate budget in proportion to the child population in the state, the fund allotment should be on the lines of a special component plan wherein every department should make a specific budgetary allocation for development activities for children. The budget allocated should be mandatorily spent.

Central Pollution Control Board’s data showed that the Air Quality Index (AQI) was 381 at 9am on Sunday, but the reading reduced to 349 at 4pm. However, Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, a forecasting model under the Union ministry of earth sciences, said the air quality was likely to improve to poor-to-moderate category on Monday and Tuesday due to strong winds. The share of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 was just 8% on Sunday. Track the pollution level in your cityAccording to Met officials, strong winds cause dispersal of pollutants. RK Jenamani, senior scientist at India Meteorological Department (IMD), said, “As predicted, winds in Delhi on Saturday reached 15-20 kmph between 11am and 1pm. Even visibility improved to 2,200 metres at Safdarjung, the city’s base weather station, and to 3,000 metres at Palam during this period. The visibility was 800 metres on Sunday morning.” The wind speed remained better during the entire day compared with the past few days. VK Soni, head, environment and research centre, IMD, said, “Unlike the past few days, when the wind speed normally went down to nil in the evening, it was recorded at up to 6kmph at Safdarjung at 7pm, allowing dispersal of pollutants. As strong winds are expected for the next two days, significant improvement in air quality is predicted on Monday and Tuesday.” IMD’s forecast shows that strong surface winds at the speed of 20-30 kmph are likely on Monday. Experts said after some providing relief to residents on Monday and Tuesday, the air quality is likely to start deteriorating from November 24 as wind speed is predicted to slow down. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the forecasting body under Union ministry of earth sciences, said, “Transport level winds coming from the favourable northwest direction are likely to become strong from Sunday night till November 23 noon. As farm fire counts are reducing rapidly, the share of stubble burning related pollutants to Delhi’s PM2.5 may remain negligible in spite of high wind speeds.” “Relatively high surface winds and moderate mixing layer height results in efficient ventilation of near-surface pollutants. Drastic reduction in fire counts and increase in surface wind speed can improve the air quality to the lower end of the very poor category for the next two days. From November 24, there may be a drop in temperature as well as surface wind speed, which will lead to less dispersion of pollutants. However, transport-level wind speed is likely to reduce, keeping the air quality in the upper end of poor to lower end of very poor category. The impact of farm fires (count 181) on Delhi’s PM2.5 is negligible at 8%,” added SAFAR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/wind-acts-as-moderator-you-can-expect-more-relief-in-coming-days/articleshow/87837083.cms||---

It has moved to the ‘moderate’ level for the first time in the last 10 days. In other districts of the state too, the air quality has improved drastically. Cities, including Udaipur, Jodhpur, Ajmer, and Pali, have recorded a ‘satisfactory’ air quality, while Kota and Alwar have reported a ‘moderate’ air quality. Except for Bhiwadi, not a single district in the state has ‘poor’ or ‘very poor’ air quality. The city witnessed a clear sky on Sunday. Health experts claimed that due to the change in velocity of air, the pollutants have disappeared to some extent, but Jaipur still has a long way to go. Jodhpur, Ajmer, Udaipur, and Pali have recorded better air quality than Jaipur. According to the Central Pollution Control Board, Ajmer has the lowest Air Quality Index (AQI) in the state at 59, while Pali’s AQI is at 66. At 258, Pali had recorded the highest AQI in the state from November 15 to 21. For the first time this month, the AQI in Jodhpur has slipped below 100 and touched 91 on Sunday, which shows that Jodhpur has the best air quality. Besides, Jaipur reported an AQI of 163, Udaipur 100, and Alwar was at 128. Health experts have pointed out that the increasing pollution-level can affect different organs of the body. It can not only affect our lungs, but also the heart and the brain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/air-quality-improves-turns-moderate-after-10-days/articleshow/87837085.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||6,244km of roads to be dug up in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: When the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), assured the HC on Friday that its roads and buildings department will ensure that no newly laid or resurfaced roads will be dug by Road Opening (RO) or utility service agencies, the civic body should have taken a peek into its own records. Here is the inevitable truth. Between September this year and July 2022, road opening agencies — which includes municipal, state, central government, semi-government and private utility providers put together — are to dig 25,315 road stretches which accumulates into 6,244km of roads. This translates to digging city roads 2.5 times over considering that the official municipal road length of Ahmedabad is 2,580km ! This does not end there. In 10 months from now, these agencies together will bore 3 lakh pits into city roads for installation of underground junctions for civic utility pipelines and cable networks. The individual utility companies will dig anywhere between as small as 10.46km to 3,274km of road length. But how much does the AMC pay towards road repairs if the utility company does a shoddy work, and this also allows the road contractor to be off the defect liability period for that particular road stretch? “It is the AMC and not the road contractor, which ends up paying towards the road repairs if the utility company does a poor road repair work after digging,” claims a senior AMC official. To give a perspective, the AMC will spend at the rate of Rs 1,385 per square metre for filling potholes of minimum 75mm depth. This year alone the AMC has coughed up approximately Rs 176 crore for road repairs and repaired 25,623 potholes, of which 4,333 potholes were in western part of the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/6244km-of-roads-to-be-dug-up-/articleshow/87837094.cms||Soumitra Trivedi
---||India||CAG lens on natural resources to prevent any 'windfall gain'||NEW DELHI: Assessing ‘windfall gain’, made a commonplace term by the coal scam, is back in currency and likely to be a permanent feature with the comptroller and auditor general (CAG) beginning the process of national resources accounting (NRA) that seeks tighter scrutiny and accounting of mineral and energy resources from the states. All states and UTs have been asked to submit their ‘assets account’ towards their mineral and energy resources for 2020-21 by March next year for the auditor to complete cross-verification of physical and monetary values of these assets. The exercise will involve verification of revenue earned by the exchequer through royalty from the extraction of mineral and energy resources, except oil and gas which are under the Centre, by private or public sector companies. Oil and natural gas have a separate accounting process. The ‘assets account’ will give information about total mineral resources of a state, its yearly extraction, the estimated market value and the actual revenue earned. A comparative study by the auditor will prompt each state on ‘windfall gain’ to private entities, if any, on account of lower royalty extracted/pilferages. The implementation of NRA has been taken up on priority as “a nationally important project” and a government accounting standards and advisory board set up in the CAG with this agenda came out with its first concept paper on NRA in July 2020. Last time, when the CAG had conducted a similar exercise (like the NRA) involving allocations of captive coal blocks, Cabinet ministers of the then UPA dispensation had publicly disapproved and questioned the auditor’s intent. A 2012 CAG report had estimated a ‘windfall gain’ of more than Rs 1.8 lakh crore to private and public sector companies that had been allotted captive coal blocks. Finally, a Supreme Court-monitored CBI probe against irregularities in coal block allocations culminated in the cancellation of all allotments made between 2004 and 2011. In its ongoing NRA exercise, the federal auditor has issued a directive to states through a “template of assets account” asking them to “streamline and enhance their internal control mechanism on mining activities” that includes mandatory installation of automated e-permit system with bar-coding for verification at the check-post. This will enable real time information sharing with relevant regulatory authorities. The auditor has also sought to enact stringent penal measures against defaulting entities, including government departments and officials who fail to comply with these ‘stringent’ measures, not ensuring valid e-permits or royalty collection while allowing transportation. The next on the NRA list is accounting for water resources, land and forest & wildlife.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cag-lens-on-natural-resources-to-prevent-any-windfall-gain/articleshow/87838213.cms||Pradeep Thakur

Shahibaug police officers said the deceased was identified as Sharda Agrawal, resident of Nakoda Park Society near Sujata flats in Shahibaug. Agrawal used to wake up at around 5.30am every day and feed stray dogs and birds outside her house. On Saturday, she woke up at her routine time and then went to the terrace. Her family members, who were about to wake up from their sleep, thought that she would be going to feed the stray animals and birds. Agrawal then climbed to the terrace and stayed there for around an hour before making up her mind to end her life, said an officer of Shahibaug police. At around 6.30am on Saturday, she jumped form the terrace of her house and fell on ground in which she suffered severe injuries on her face and head, said the officer. A security guard deployed at the society’s gate, who heard a big sound, soon realized that someone had fallen from the terrace. He rushed to the spot and found her lying in a pool of blood. He informed her family members who called up an ambulance but by the time medicos reached there, she was dead. “We learned that she was suffering with diabetes for around two decades and she had undergone open heart surgery last year,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sick-of-ailments-78-year-old-woman-kills-self-in-shahibaug/articleshow/87837105.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: With lockdowns gone, child abuse cases increase from previous year||NEW DELHI: Compared with last year, Delhi saw an increase in child abuse cases registered under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act in 2021. Delhi Police data accessed by TOIshowed that till November 11, over 1,000 cases were registered in police stations across the city compared with about 850 last year. The law enforcement agency solved more than 990 cases and arrested over 1,100 accused. Last year, 95% of the cases were solved. A senior officer said last year, because of the lockdown, parents stayed at home with their children due to which they were continuously being watched and taken care of. “We found that most of the accused were known to the victims,” added the officer. Another officer said elopement was a major reason behind the crimes. “We found that girls came in contact with a person through chatting or a phone call. They then started meeting and on the pretext of love or marriage they eloped. When the victims were rescued, they claimed that they were sexually abused,” said the officer. In October, a 15-year-old girl kidnapped from Delhi and sold for marriage in Rajasthan was rescued by police. The girl was lured by a man living in her neighbourhood, taken to Agra on the pretext of visiting a fair and then sold for marriage. She was allegedly sexually assaulted. A Child Welfare Committee (CWC) member said children from economically weak backgrounds were vulnerable to abuse. “We have observed that to earn money, labourer parents leave their children at home and go for work. These kids become vulnerable as any person can commit a crime with them,” added the member. Sources said 145 POCSO cases were registered in Southeast district and more than 90% were solved. Dwarka district reported 120 cases and solved 90% of them. More than 100 cases each were registered in Rohini and Outer-North districts and both solved 97% of the crimes. CWC-1 chairperson Meenu Mehta said POCSO cases were rising rapidly because children were unaware of the proper and safe use of the internet. “During the pandemic, children have been using mobile phones more due to online classes and often come in contact with strangers. They are then misguided and lured on the pretext of love and passion,” she added. In several cases, the CWC observed that during chatting with known people or strangers, the children shared photographs or revealed secrets and became victims of blackmailing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/with-lockdowns-gone-child-abuse-cases-increase-from-previous-year/articleshow/87837103.cms||Abhay Singh

Speaking at a children’s day programme organised by the Commission for Protection of Child Rights for 20 children with thalassemia, haemophilia and HIV at Bal Bhavan, Dr Silveira advised them not to fall prey to negativity and not to focus on the what’s missing in their lives, but be grateful for the talents they possess. “Everyone can become what he/she desires to become. Put the goal in front of you and go all out to achieve it,” she said. The event was held to understand the condition of children living with chronic health conditions. Bal Bhavan director Dayanand Chawdikar offered to conduct free training sessions for children with disabilities at Bal Bhavan centres across the state. He also extended cooperation to the commission in its mission to reach out to children so that they are not denied their rights and benefits. The commission's chairperson, Peter Borges, told parents that the commission will examine issues these children face and recommend measures for social protection to increase their quality of life. “I understand that having a child who has a chronic health condition can lead to loss of hope for an ‘ideal’ child. Further siblings also get neglected and there are major expenses. Time commitment, confusion caused by conflicting systems of health care management, lost opportunities and social isolation are some of the other troubles you all undergo,” he told the parents. The programme consisted of speeches, dramas, songs, group and other cultural performances conducted by JCI (Eshan Usapkar and his team). The event was coordinated by members of the commission, Rekha D’Silva, Anita Tilve, Vaibhavi Gavade, Pradnya Desai, Neelam Naik and Balaji Mayekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dont-let-your-chronic-condition-stop-you-from-achieving-goals/articleshow/87837149.cms||---

---||Visakhapatnam||Tirupati still cut off, alarm over breach threat to bund||TIRUPATI: The temple city of Tirupati continued to remain cut off for the fourth day on Sunday as road and train services were badly hit with severe damage to highways and railway tracks at a few vantage places. The rising water levels at Rayalacheruvu, which is one of the major water bodies abutting the temple city of Tirupati, has come as a major concern for officials who have been continuously battling the flood situation over the last four days. The Chittoor district administration on Sunday vacated 18 villages abutting the lake as the threat of a breach to the major water body loomed large with heavy inflows into it. All arterial roads linking Tirupati with Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Vijayawada were affected. Even the main railway route connecting the temple city was affected forcing the authorities to cancel dozens of train services. Officials began strengthening the bund of the lake and shifted people living in low-lying areas to safety as the bund was on the verge of breaching. Any breach to the bund could trigger a massive deluge and devastation. Locals fear that a breach in Rayalacheruvu could submerge more than 100 villages. Senior bureaucrat P S Pradyumna, who has been appointed as a special officer to oversee the flood situation in Chittoor, along with collector M Hari Narayana and Tirupati SP CH Venkata Appala Naidu visited the Rayalacheruvu and inspected the bund. Leakage was reported from four places. Based on the advice of the irrigation officials, measures to plug the leakages using cement and sand were undertaken at the spot by roping in some local villagers. According to Pradyumna, Rayalacheruvu now stores 0.9 thousand million cubic (tmc) feet of water, which is well above its holding capacity. “After leakages were noticed and since there is a possibility of breach, we have asked villagers of 18 nearby villages to shift to shelter zones immediately. National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) teams have been placed on standby,” added Pradyumna. Meanwhile, following public announcements asking people to leave their homes along with their valuables and important documents, residents of 18 villages were shifted to an engineering college at C Ramapuram village on Sunday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/tirupati-still-cut-off-alarm-over-breach-threat-to-bund/articleshow/87837578.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

S Boominathan, 50, who was on patrol duty, had even caught hold of the duo but the two suddenly attacked him with sharp weapons leaving him dead. Boominathan, along with another policeman Chithiraivelu, was on patrol duty at 2 am when he spotted two men on a bike with a goat. Suspecting they were goat thieves, he tried to intercept them, but they fled. Boominathan chased them on his bike while his colleague followed on his two-wheeler. The fleeing men headed towards Keeranur along village roads. When they neared Palathupatti village near Kalamavur railway gate in Pudukottai district, Boominathan caught hold of the two as the subway filled with rainwater was found blocked with stones. After taking control of the two, the SSI called Chithiraivelu on his phone and asked him to come over. However, the two accused suddenly attacked Boominathan with sharp weapons from behind and fled. With deep cut injuries on his head, he succumbed to grievous injuries on the spot. By the time his associate reached the spot, Boominathan had died of injuries, police said. The SSI is survived by his wife B Kavitha, 45, and son B Kugan, 21. Condoling the death, chief minister M K Stalin announced Rs 1 crore aid to the bereaved family and a government job to one of the family members.

Residents urged the corporation to prune damaged branches and cut off the trees that are on the verge of being uprooted. “Water inundation on roadsides has loosened the soil thereby weakening the roots. Some of the trees were partially uprooted. We had petitioned the city corporation a few days back but there has not been any response,” said S Krishnan, a resident of Ram Nagar. A senior official of the corporation said they have started to prune tree branches wherever it is necessary. “But the authority to cut off trees is vested with the revenue department. We have taken up the matter with the revenue officials,” said the official. However, activists and resident welfare associations asked the administration to remain sensitive on cutting down trees as unscrupulous felling of trees may further affect the green cover of the city. “There is no second thought that the roadside trees that got damaged due to rain need to be removed to avoid accidents. But at the same time, it should not pave way for unnecessary felling of trees,” said M Loganathan, state coordinator of Federation for Sustainable Development. He added that administration should develop a comprehensive database of trees in the city. “On many occasions, owners of commercial establishment cut off trees on roadsides illegally to ensure better visibility to their facilities. Having a database of trees will prevent such activities.” K Syed Kattuva of Marangalukku Maruvalu Amaippu said most stretches of the city have exotic trees like May flower, pelta forum tree, ‘Albizia saman’ tree and ‘thoongu moonji maram’. These trees are easily damaged during rain unlike the native tree species. Stressing on the necessity to save existing trees than planting new ones, Syed Kattuva said the administration must engage experts who can give suggestion on the health condition of trees so that trees can be saved by ways of restoration instead of cutting them down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/damaged-trees-pose-threat-to-commuters/articleshow/87837111.cms||Sampath Kumar

Protesters have threatened to intensify the agitation if the disputed structure is not demolished. “Old Goa has been declared a World Heritage Site by Unesco. It is also recognised by the Archaeological Survey of India. The church in Old Goa is an architectural masterpiece and attracts a large number of tourists,” historian Prajal Sakhardande said, alleging that the construction has the backing of politicians. “The construction work at the heritage site of St Cajetan Church has no permissions. It must be demolished. Otherwise, we fear Unesco will take away Old Goa’s world heritage status,” he said. Protesters alleged that the construction of a bungalow has been undertaken by a fashion designer who is a BJP functionary in Mumbai and hence no action is being taken by the government. “The people of Old Goa have been protesting, but the government is ignoring their demand,” Andrea Mascarenhas said, adding that the construction is nearing completion. She said if this illegal construction is encouraged, more such constructions would come up and the world heritage site would be destroyed. Among those present were wife of ex-speaker Vishnu Wagh, Aruna, AAP’s Pratima Coutinho and architect Dean D’Cruz.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/more-protests-at-old-goa-against-ongoing-construction-at-heritage-site/articleshow/87837146.cms||---

---||Goa||Igor Angulo returns to haunt former club FC Goa in Mumbai’s comfortable 3-0 win||There is no stopping Igor Angulo, whether he is at FC Goa or at Mumbai City FC. The Spanish striker who won the Golden Boot last season with Goa showed his former team what they are missing as he scored two in Mumbai’s comfortable 3-0 win at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Monday. Goa head coach Juan Ferrando had praised Igor’s efficiency in front of goal and the Spanish striker returned to haunt his former club. The 37-year-old, dropped for the AFC Champions League, first converted a penalty in the 33rd minute and then sealed his brace three minutes later with a peach of a strike. Brazilian Ygor Catatau rose from the bench in the second half and scored with his first touch, giving Mumbai’s title defence the perfect start under new coach Des Buckingham. The result ended Goa’s 15-match unbeaten run in the league. Goa had fallen short in last season’s semifinals in the penalty shoot-out against Mumbai and there were high hopes from the Durand Cup champions in Ferrando’s second season. The teams were cautious with their approach and tried to work on their combinations. But It wasn’t easy to build up promising moves. Mumbai’s Vignesh Dakshinamurthy did come up with a solo run early in the game, but had to pay a price for it after a tackle by left-back Leander D’Cunha, who started ahead of international Seriton Fernandes. Goa were lucky as match referee A Rowan overlooked the penalty call, even as Mumbai were forced to replace the injured Vignesh. While the physical battle continued, Glan Martins did well to win the ball from Ahmed Jahouh at the half an hour mark after a pass from goalkeeper Mohammad Nawaz. However, Goa’s new striker Airam Cabrera couldn’t connect the decisive pass from Glan in front of goal. At the other end, Mumbai soon won a penalty after the cooling break when Ivan Gonzalez brought down Cassio Gabriel. Igor stepped up for the spot-kick and sent it past goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh. Three minutes later, Goa were rubbing their eyes in disbelief as Igor finished with yet another clinical strike. It could have been worse for Goa before the break when debutant Lalhmangaihsanga lost the ball to Cassio. Mumbai marched in numbers but Raynier Fernandes didn’t have the composure in a one-on-one situation and saw his effort come off the horizontal bar. Goa did start the second half with a desire to get back into the match but were losing possession in dangerous areas, inviting pressure on themselves. Airam worked hard but missed distribution from midfield which the injured Brandon Fernandes could have provided. Ferrando decided to introduce Jorge Ortiz in place of Airam in the hope of pulling a goal back. With 15 minutes left to be played, the teams made a couple of substitutions. But it were Mumbai who benefited from a set piece as Ygor headed in off a free-kick to leave Goa shell-shocked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/igor-angulo-returns-to-haunt-former-club-fc-goa-in-mumbais-comfortable-3-0-win/articleshow/87856412.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

NMC had recruited 1,125 health staff including 180 medical officers, 125 staff nurses, 55 pharmacists, 140 ward boys, 219 ANM, 70 lab technicians etc for three months. However, the civic body had given them an extension twice until November 30. But after a continuous drop in new Covid cases in the city, the NMC administration has decided to release all the temporary staff except nurses after November 30. The officials said that it is difficult to get trained staff nurses, hence all the temporary staff nurses would be retained till January and further decisions about their extension will be taken thereafter considering the Covid-19 scenario.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-civic-body-to-retain-125-temp-nurses/articleshow/87835813.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Hyderabad||Now, gunny bag crisis hits paddy farmers in Telangana||HYDERABAD: After heavy rains destroyed crops, farmers in Telangana have their tasks cut out with a huge scarcity of gunny bags to pack their paddy. Compounding the paddy procurement scenario, the state now has only 12 crore jute bags as compared to the required 25 crore jute bags for this season. Despite having received tokens to sell their produce at procurement centres, hundreds of farmers across all districts are unable to do so because they lack bags. Heavy rains have already increased the moisture content of paddy and jute bags are designed to reduce it, experts said. Paddy with more than 14 % moisture content is not recognised as good product under current standards. This season, paddy was cultivated on 25 lakh hectares, with a yield of 1. 2 crore tonnes projected. “Every season there is a demand for 20 crore jute bags, but this time the demand has risen to 24 crore bags. There is paucity of bags because there is complete dependence primarily on West Bengal and adjacent Andhra Pradesh,” a top government official said. The state administration had said that units would be set up to manufacture jute bags, but nothing came of it. Apart from procuring grain, the Food Corporation of India (FCI) also provides farmers with jute bags at a cost of Rs 20. The bags are intended for one-time purchases, however, due to a supply shortfall, FCI permitted the use of used bags last season. “Even if such bags are considered, we only have 12 crore bags,” a source added. As paddy production increases, contractors are raising prices of bags to meet the increased demand from other states. Farmers are also worried because each acre requires at least 80 bags to transport paddy to the procurement facilities. “Some of us received tokens, but not bags. However, in some areas we were unable to obtain tokens because they are distributed based on availability,” said Yadagiri, a farmer from Narayanpet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/now-gunny-bag-crisis-hits-paddy-farmers/articleshow/87837602.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Nashik||NMC recruitment plan likely to face administrative cost hurdle||Nashik: The rising administrative cost of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) is likely to affect its plans to recruit over 1,500 temporary workers on honorarium basis for a period of 11 months. The civic body has been unable to recruit for over 2,900 vacant posts in the due to higher administrative costs. The NMC, as per rule, can recruit new employees only if the administrative cost is below 35%. The general body (GB) of the Nashik Municipal Corporation, during the recent special meeting, had given its nod to the proposal of the standing committee to recruit temporary workers on honorarium basis in various departments to overcome the manpower crisis. Municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav told reporters that he will study the resolution of the GB on hiring temporary staff on honorarium and then will send a resolution to the state government for approval. An NMC official said the revenue of NMC through various taxes has declined to a large extent over the last two years due to the ongoing Covid pandemic. The NMC has also started implementation of the Seventh Pay Commission for its employees. “Hence, the drop in income and rise in expenses has led to a rise in administrative cost of the civic body,” the official said. “The administrative cost of the NMC, which was only 29.83% before the pandemic in 2019-20, has now increased to 38.21%. Considering the rising cost, the NMC will need to seek approval from the state government in this connection. But higher administrative costs may hit NMC’s plan,” he added. The official also said there are a total of 7,717 posts in the Nashik Municipal Corporation, out of which 2,979 are lying vacant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-recruitment-plan-likely-to-face-administrative-cost-hurdle/articleshow/87835838.cms||Tushar Pawar

Managements of these schools had been requesting the department to allow them to fill vacant posts but the latter never gave a nod, citing lack of funds. The salary of aided-schoolteachers in the district is paid by the education department. The number of posts lying vacant in aided schools is around 200 but the department’s nod for filling as many posts seems unlikely. The explanation that the department gives is that the number of students in these schools has declined over the years. A department official said, “Teachers’ recruitments will depend on the number of students in schools. Once the schools give us details about the number of posts, we will give approval, keeping in mind the number of students.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/aided-schools-get-nod-to-hire-teachers/articleshow/87836483.cms||Mohammad Anab

So, when I called his mobile, someone told us to come to the spot for an emergency situation.” While Prem’s father Munnalal, who runs a general store, said, “Everything is over for the family today.

Organised jointly by the state tourism department and the district administration with a view to attract foreign tourists and boost local tourism, the Bundi Utsav will witness a chain of events in next two days. Ironically, this year’s event will see minimal foreign tourists due to the pandemic-induced restrictions on travel. However, Bundi district collector Renu Jaipal called upon the people and tourists to participate in the two-day Bundi Utsav to make the event success. In view of compliance of the Covid-19 protocol, the festivities that were earlier organised at the sub-division headquarters, will be confined to the district headquarters, assistant tourist officer Premshankar Saini said on Sunday. Following the worship of Lord Ganesh, a variety of folk events will be presented by artist groups at popular tourist locations in the city, he said. During the two days, tourists will be allowed free entrance to popular tourist locations and monuments in the city, he said, adding various recreational events have been planned for Monday evening. Deepdan, during which earthen lamps are lit and set afloat on the waters of Nawal Sagar Lake in the city, will also be held on Monday evening, Saini said.

West Nagpur MLA Vikas Thakre has blamed a tractor manufacturing and transport company for the destruction and inconvenience to the people. A major stretch of the road is in very bad condition. Large number of potholes have cropped up on the road. At some places, the lower base of the road below tar has been damaged to a great extent. Due to potholes and damage to lower base, a lot of dust swirls with each movement of vehicles. Dust can be seen spread on agriculture crops, on residential buildings and open plots along the road. Information from the state’s public works department shows the road was widened and tarred three years ago. The road was constructed for convenience of the people travelling from Hingna, Wanadongri to Amravati road towards Waddhamna, Wadi etc and vice versa. Works of strengthening the lower base of the road were also carried out. Thakre, also president of city Congress committee, lodged a complaint with deputy commissioner of police (traffic) a few days ago and sought action. “Mahindra and Mahindra Limited has constructed a godown for storing tractors on a sprawling plot on this road. The user of the land is agriculture and it cannot be utilized for industrial or commercial purpose. Also, the godown is situated within agriculture farms and residential buildings. Still, the violations are going on,” he said. Thakre added truck-trailers transporting tractors from plant situated at MIDC Hingna to the godown and then towards Amravati Road have damaged the road. “Regular movement of truck-trailers is also posing threat to people, especially students. There are schools as well as dental colleges on this road apart from houses and farms. Road mishaps have become common on this road especially in evening due to large number of potholes,” he said. An official from Mahindra and Mahindra Limited said, “We have not received any complaint in this regard. Godown is taken care by our head office so will have to check. Not only truck-trailers but other trucks laden with goods regularly run on that road. Therefore, blaming only truck-trailers transporting tractors is not proper. We will look into the issue and do the needful.” The road is situated on city’s outskirts in Hingna assembly constituency. BJP MLA from Hingna constituency Sameer Meghe blamed the Maha Vikas Aghadi for not sanctioning funds for repairing of roads. “Government has not sanctioned any funds for repairing of this road and others in my constituency in last two years. I have written many letters seeking funds for repairing and widening of roads but nothing happened,” he said. In a nutshell * State PWD widened and tarred road connecting Wanadongri with Waddhamna three years ago * Lower base of the road was also strengthened * Large number of potholes have cropped up on the road * Lower base below tar also damaged to a great extent * MLA Vikas Thakre lodged complaint with traffic police and sought info from tractor manufacturing company * Thakre alleged company constructed godown on the road * Truck-trailers transport tractors from manufacturing unit in MIDC Hingna to godown regularly say they are responsible for damage to the road * Thakre also said his land is for agriculture use and being utilized for industrial/commercial purpose in violation of norms * MLA Sameer Meghe blamed government for not sanctioning funds for repairing of the roads||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/road-gets-damaged-in-3-yrs-mla-blames-unauthorized-godown-of-tractor-company/articleshow/87837152.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

This is the third time any tagged steppe eagle was recorded in Jorbeer, the hub of migratory birds of prey in Rajasthan. Ornithologists who are tracking the migration path claimed that the bird flew from Russia to Bikaner taking the route of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India (via Jaisalmer and Jodhpur). International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) member Dau Lal Bohra said the bird was tagged under Russian Raptor Research and Conservation Network with scientists Igor Karyakin and Elvira Nikolenko and was on its first voyage to Rajasthan. “It’s a good sign that raptors from Altai-Sayan region are coming to Thar desert. In previous migration route studies, it was witnessed that these birds were flying till Mongolia and Oman,” he added. Though the migratory birds at this Important Bird Area (IBA) site have started coming and 17 species can be seen at this carcass dumping site, not many measures have been taken by the Centre and state government to protect these winged guests. Bhawana Tanwar, a wildlife researcher said, “In the past two weeks, carcasses of six steppe eagles were found, which died due to electrocution and unidentified reasons.  As Jorbeer hosts highest number of raptors in the country and Asia, the ministry of environment and forests (MoEF) should make a conservation plan with the state.” Sources said a steppe eagle named Kenjyk, which came to Rajasthan in March 2021, was suspected to be hunted by nomadic tribe Bawaria in Jhunjhunu district. The bird was tagged in Central Kazakhstan in 2018, died on its third voyage to Rajasthan. “The forest and police administration was informed about the poaching of tagged bird, however, no concrete step was taken. Electrocution, poaching, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and feral dogs attack are major threats to these raptors in Rajasthan. But, state government has not taking the issue seriously,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/steppe-eagle-tagged-in-russia-seen-in-jorbeer/articleshow/87837156.cms||Ajay Singh

Sanjay asked, “why he couldn’t pay Rs 20 lakh compensation to farmers and unemployed youth who committed suicide in the state.” In a press conference on Sunday, Sanjay said that CM does not care about paying compensation to Telangana martyrs. “Even though NCRB data shows that Telangana is among the top states in the country with a high number of farmer suicides, they are not given huge compensation. Where does CM get money for farmers elsewhere?,” he asked. Taking potshots at the TRS’ claim that farm laws were repealed after CM KCR sat on a dharna, Sanjay remarked, “We should applaud him for doing so, isn’t he the same person who changed his stance on farm laws numerous times, once he was supporting farm laws and then he was opposing it.” Karimnagar MP demanded that the state government speed up the paddy procurement in the state on a war footing. He asked the CM, “Is it not true that the Union government has committed to procure 40 lakh tonnes of rice but the state government has failed to make arrangements?” He alleged that the state administration is attempting to defend the interests of the state’s rice millers, claiming that “because of TRS shortcomings, farmers in the state have problems cultivating and selling the paddy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bandi-why-rs-20l-not-given-to-t-farmers-who-committed-suicide/articleshow/87837611.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Dr Abhijat Sheth, President, National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences revealed that NBE is planning to impart training on communication and conduct workshops on communication train PG doctors. He pointed out that it is important for a PG trainee to know how to break bad news and how to counsel a patient and their family in such conditions. “Effective communication need not always be long and need not be verbal, non-verbal also makes a difference, so while treating the patient our body language also plays a role, therefore we should be conscious of it. If you convey too much information it can also lead to issues, patients go back and do Google search and pose doubts, so what we convey should be appropriate and limited to it. ,” added the governor. The conference was hosted by Apollo Hospitals, Hyderabad with the National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences (NBEMS), Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Govt. of India and in association with the Society for Development & Implementation of Professional Curriculum for Communication in Healthcare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/guv-communication-key-in-healthcare/articleshow/87837616.cms||---

The Entertainment Society of Goa (ESG) announced a special section for Goan films during the ongoing Iffi. Eight films will be screened as part of this section. The announcement came within an hour after Congress threatened to protest outside the Iffi venue if Goan fiction and non-fiction movies were not showcased at the annual event. “I demand that chief minister Pramod Sawant must announce whether all the selected films will be part of the official section and whether film producers will receive benefits under the Goa film finance scheme,” Kamat said. The opposition leader said that merely announcing a special section for Goan films is not enough as mere screening without the financial benefits will be akin to cheating the local film fraternity. “I once again demand that ESG must cancel clause 9 of the regulations issued by them for selecting Goan films for Iffi 2021 and give financial assistance of Rs 5 lakh to feature films and Rs 2.5 lakh for non-feature films selected for Iffi 2021,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-goan-films-selected-for-iffi-screening-get-financial-aid/articleshow/87837164.cms||---

Besides, Mau Police seized properties worth around Rs 3 crore of his close aides Suresh Singh and Mahmood.ADG Varanasi zone Brij Bhushan told TOI on Sunday, “One team of Azamgarh Police was sent to Lucknow on Saturday to attach a 194 sq m plot worth Rs 3 crore in Husainganj area purchased by Mukhtar in 2007 with his illegally earned money in his wife’s name.”“Mau Police also initiated action against Mukhtar Ansari’s close associate Suresh Singh involved in extortion on the behalf of the gang. It also took action against Mahmood, who grabbed contracts in government departments with the Mukhtar’s backing,” the ADG added.Following the orders of Mau district magistrate to confiscate the properties of Singh and Mahmood under Gangster Act, a team of officials and police attached Singh’s house worth Rs 1.82 crore, and seized four vehicles, including three four-wheelers of Mahmood worth Rs 33.11 lakh, he said.A plot, tractor, and a motorcycle worth Rs 66.10 lakh of liquor mafia Vinod Yadav, who flourished with Mukhtar’s backing, were also attached at Daulsepur under Ranipur police station.Before giving a jolt of over Rs 6 crore in a day, Ghazipur Police had confiscated a shopping complex worth Rs 2.84 crore of Mukhtar’s wife Afsha Ansari in Dyodhi Ballabhdas locality under Kotwali police station on October 26.As political activity has intensified with the state assembly elections due in a few months, many political developments have taken place in Mau and Ghazipur districts, known as Mukhtar Ansari’s bastion.Few days after the formal announcement of a pre-poll alliance between Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party and Samajwadi Party at Mau on October 27, SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar had visited Banda jail to meet Mukhtar.Replying to questions on his meeting with Mukhtar in jail, Rajbhar had asked how can Ansari be termed a criminal until he is convicted.On November 17, while rolling out the fourth phase of his Vijay Yatra on Purvanchal Expressway in Ghazipur with Mukhtar’s brother Shibgatullah Ansari on board his chariot, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav had called upon the people to oust the BJP government while accusing it of only bulldozing properties in the past one and half years.“All the movable and immovable properties of Mukhtar, his family and gang members amassed with illegally-earned money are under scanner and the process of their confiscation under Gangster Act has started following completion of investigation. This process is continuing as more properties are under the lens, the ADG said,” hinting at more action in the coming days.The state government had launched a drive against organised gangs in east UP from mid-2019 and the fish trade and extortion mafia associated with Mukhtar had been targeted by police in Mau. The value of losses caused to the economic empire of gangsters and mafia elements in the zone has gone above Rs 530 crore, including over Rs 370 crore of Mukhtar gang, the ADG said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/crackdown-on-mukhtar-gang-starts-again-property-worth-rs-6cr-seized/articleshow/87836516.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Varun Tevatia, the owner of Tevatia market complex where Vardhaman printing store is located, shot at Puneet Jain on his chest and walked away, said local shopkeepers, who thronged Jain’s store after hearing a gunshot and alerted police immediately. Jain was shifted to a hospital where he was operated upon, said police, adding that his condition is, however, stated to be critical. The crime sent a shock wave across the markets in the city. Soon, a massive protest was launched by the agitated business community, who pulled down the shutters and demanded immediate arrest of the accused and suspension of the Budhana police station in charge. Stating that the law and order situation in Meerut has been deteriorating with each passing day, the shopkeepers demanded a probe into the crime by the SSP or any other senior police officer. Meanwhile, Ajay Gupta, president of Joint Trade Association, announced that all markets in the city would remain closed on Monday if police failed to arrest the accused. “Incidents of robberies and shootings are rampant in the city. Criminals have gone out of control in the past few months due to apathy of the police and the administration,” said Gupta, who is also an office-bearer of the local BJP unit. “I will speak about the crime with CM Yogi. The SSP and other senior police officers even didn’t turn up to the spot. Their apathy has given strength to the criminals,” he added. Last week, a businessman was robbed of Rs 2 lakh on the busy Begum Bridge here. As large numbers of people from various business associations and locals gathered at the spot, police swung into action and arrested the accused within a few hours, and seized the pistol used in the crime from his possession. SSP Prabhakar Chaudhary said, “According to the accused, he had a dispute with the victim over delayed payment of the rent. The accused wanted the victim to vacate the shop as he was not paying rents even after repeated reminders.” “The accused, who already has three criminal cases registered against him for the attempt to murder and under the Arms Act, was booked under relevant sections of the IPC,” added the SSP. Meanwhile, the traders repealed their bandh call after the accused was arrested. However, a meeting of the traders with senior police officers is scheduled for Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/bizman-fatally-shot-at-in-busy-meerut-market-accused-held/articleshow/87836522.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Meerut||Bijnor pitches for heritage tag for 4 bldgs to boost tourism||Bijnor: The district administration has identified four buildings that are to be accorded the heritage status in Bijnor. These are the district magistrate’s residence and palaces of Sahanpur, Shyau and Tajpur. In December, two additional gates for Amangarh tiger reserve (ATR) are proposed to be opened at Afzalgarh Rehar Road. Plans are also afoot to introduce a hot air balloon facility from Vidurkuti to Ganga Barrage. All these proposals are aimed at giving a boost to tourism in the district that spans 4,049 square km. A major cane-producing district, Bijnor has several places with historical, religious, and cultural significance. Its lush forests are home to several species of wildlife, including tigers, elephants and swamp deer. Criss-crossed by seven rivers, including the Ganga and its tributaries, it has a variety of rich aqua life, including dolphins, otters, gharials and turtles, some of which are endangered and attracts flocks of migratory birds in winter. Talking with TOI, executive engineer, PWD, Sunil Sagar, said, “With the help of other departments, we have prepared a proposal to develop 11 spots in the district as tourist places.” Sagar said, “The 150-year-old DM's kothi (house) built during the British Raj is proposed to be declared a heritage museum. The archaeological department has inspected it. If all goes well, it will be converted into a museum housing artefacts of the bygone era.” He said efforts are also underway to convert three palaces in the district into heritage hotels on the lines of Rajasthan. “The proposal to convert the palaces of Sayau, Raja's Tajpur, Sahanpur into heritage hotels has been completed. Owners of the palaces themselves will develop these palaces into heritage hotels,” said Sagar. Owner of Takpur's palace, Raja Inderjit Singh, said, “Heritage hotels are running well in Rajasthan. If the proposal is approved, the palace will be protected and will pave the way for development in the surrounding areas." M Semmaran, Bijnor forest divisional officer (DFO) said, “We are awaiting funds to open two gates for tourists in Amangarh next year. The new gate will be opened this month.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/bijnor-pitches-for-heritage-tag-for-4-bldgs-to-boost-tourism/articleshow/87836509.cms||Harveer Dabas

Tikait said, “The PM has come forward for farmers. We should do something to solve the dispute, but the government should repeal these laws in a proper manner. Months-long protests cannot end within minutes.” Talking to TOI over phone in Muzaffarnagar on Sunday, Tikait said, “The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) has the right to take any decision, but I have advised it to cancel the proposed daily tractor march to Parliament during the upcoming wither session. Many insinuated the protesting farmers by calling them ‘Andolanjeevi’, ‘Khalistani’, ‘Pakistani’, etc, but farmers should maintain a good image. They are not stubborn.” When asked when farmers would go away from the protest sites at Delhi borders, Tikait said, “Only after the government gives in writing that the farm laws would be repealed, the protesters at Delhi borders will decide their next course of action.” Recently, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) had announced that around 500 farmers will participate in peaceful tractor marches to Parliament every day during the winter session scheduled to be held from November 29. After a meeting of SKM concluded at Singhu border on Sunday evening, BKU media in-charge Dharmender Malik told TOI, "SKM will hold another meeting on November 27 in which various decisions, including whether the proposed march to Parliament would be held or not, will be taken.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/pm-took-a-step-forward-farmers-should-reciprocate-bku-chief/articleshow/87836525.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Ashok Gehlot’s cabinet now a full house||JAIPUR: With the hope that chief minister Ashok Gehlot and his former deputy Sachin Pilot would bury their differences for good, the Congress central leadership orchestrated a cabinet rejig in Rajasthan by taking the state’s council of ministers to its full strength of 30 on Sunday. For the past 16 months, there were nine vacancies, which increased to 12 three days back, even as Pilot insisted on filling these at the earliest. Striking a balance in accommodating supporters of the two leaders was a tightrope walk for the Congress leadership and, hence, the delay. Governor Kalraj Mishra administered the oath of office to 15 ministers, which included 12 new faces and three juniors getting a promotion, at the Raj Bhavan in the evening. A total of 11 cabinet ministers and four junior ministers were sworn in in the presence of Gehlot and Pilot. Zahida Khan, the lone Muslim MLA among the new recruits, took the oath in English, while the others preferred Hindi. Six-term MLA and former cabinet minister Hemaram Chaudhary, a Jat leader from western Rajasthan, was the first to be sworn in. He was among the 19 Congress MLAs who revolted against Gehlot last year. Political appointments in boards/commissions and induction of parliamentary secretaries are expected in the coming days to appease the disgruntled members left out of the cabinet expansion. None of the 13 independent MLAs, who supported the Congress government in its crisis last year, have been made ministers. Both Gehlot and Pilot looked cheerful all through the day and termed the rejig a ‘balanced’ and ‘well thought out’ exercise by the Congress central leadership. Pilot went to the extent of saying that the development has guaranteed the repeat of Congress government in Rajasthan in 2023. “We will now break the state’s tradition of electing alternate governments from among Congress and BJP every five years,” Pilot said. Before the swearing in ceremony, the new ministers were honoured at the PCC headquarters. Chief minister Gehlot, while addressing Congressmen at the party event, said, “The contribution to governance of those who could not be inducted today is no less than those who have been made ministers. As Sonia Gandhi ji said once, their patience would be rewarded one day.” Urging ministers to give preference to addressing people’s grievances, Gehlot said, “Ministers should fix a time when people can come to meet daily without prior appointment. As ministers your responsibilities are towards the entire state and not just towards your constituencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gehlots-cabinet-now-a-full-house/articleshow/87837620.cms||Bhanupratap Singh

Telangana Congress president A Revanth Reddy and party floor leader in the assembly Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka were blamed for finalising Balmoor Venkat as the party candidate at the last moment, which was cited as one of the main reasons for Congress facing a drubbing. The local leadership should decide a list of first, second and third optional candidates from every assembly constituency so that a candidate’s name with better prospects of winning can be sent to the party high command, said the seniors. Amid talk that a bypoll to Vemulawada constituency before 2023 assembly polls is likely , seniors said the party should immediately hit the hustings. “Though our candidate Aadi Srinivas contested and polled over 56,000 votes from this constituency in 2018, we have asked the party to prepare a list of two to three candidates too and keep them in reserve,” said a senior leader. Srinivas said rumours were being spread that he would defect. “I have been a Congressman since the beginning and I am going to remain in the party.,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cong-must-jump-into-electoral-fray-early/articleshow/87837621.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Plea denied, look-out notice on NRI diamond trader stays||Mumbai: Bombay high court dismissed a plea to quash a lookout circular (LOC) by Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) against a non-resident Indian (NRI) who is a managing director of a diamond trading company incorporated in Hong Kong. He was stopped from leaving Delhi international airport last September. The HC said the LOC was properly issued as economic interests of India and larger public interest were involved. It said petitioner, Chaitya Shah’s “presence is necessary for effective investigation into affairs of Gitanjali Gems Ltd and other concerns’’. The HC bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Sarang Kotwal in its November 17 judgment said there was a strong flight risk as far as the petitioner was concerned. He has “dual citizenship’’ and if he decided not to return it would become difficult to bring him back, said the HC. Shah had said he was summoned by SFIO a day after he was detained at the airport and he appeared before its Mumbai office. SFIO was investigating affairs of Gitanjali, where Shah said he had purchased shares. SFIO said Mehul Choksi was one of the directors of Gitanjali, against whom it had initiated criminal proceedings. It said its “investigation revealed that Punjab National Bank reported a fraud of Rs 7,000 crore in respect of entities under control of Choksi”. Shah said he was a bona fide investor who had purchased convertible warrants worth Rs 49 crore between January 2015 and August 2016 with his money and sold them in late 2017 for Rs 50 crore, through banking channels, and had nothing to do with Choksi. Shah said he was “being victimized on false and malicious charges’’ and in violation of fundamental rights to equality and right to life as his family and business in Hong Kong was suffering due to his absence. SFIO additional public prosecutor S H Halwasia said Shah knew Choksi “for many years’’ and on his investment said, “Investigations revealed that it was money of the absconding accused Choksi who left the country.’’ Halwasia said the LOC was issued on September 8, 2020 and renewed on September 2, 2021, based on February guidelines. Shah’s senior counsel Aabad Ponda and advocate Manvendra Mishra had submitted that the LOC could be issued on the apprehension of future conduct of the person and not on the basis of past activities. “We are unable to agree with this contention as guidelines give no such indication,’’ said the HC. Ponda said the LOC cannot operate endlessly and as per guidelines it operation had ended one year after its issuance. The HC said the extension was not illegal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-plea-denied-look-out-notice-on-nri-diamond-trader-stays/articleshow/87837868.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Kids developing autism-like symptoms||HYDERABAD: Over a year after the onset of Covid-19, paediatricians have started seeing cases of children (two-to-six-year-olds) exhibiting symptoms similar to autism. No eye contact, delayed speech, no response to calling out their names, commands, lack of fear and doing things in a repetitive manner have been reported in this age group increasingly. Though on one hand these symptoms were like autism, children, in majority of these cases, were able to revert to normal behaviour after therapy. This, in the first place means that the kids, who have improved, did not have autism but had only developed symptoms of autism due to lack of social exposure. Speaking about the scenario, Dr Satish Ghanta, neonatologist and paediatric intensivist, Little Stars Children’s Hospital, said that around 20% of toddlers seen in outpatient were exhibiting such symptoms. “The lack of physical contact, poor social contact, no physical activity and addiction to the mobile phones have had a deep and lasting impact on the brain...They are behaving like that because they are socially deprived and once these problems are addressed most get better,” he said. Dr Dinesh Kumar Chirla, director, intensive care services at Rainbow Children’s Hospitals, who has been seeing 6-7 such cases per week for a year now, said, “As paediatricians, when cases of toddlers not being attentive, having repetitive behaviour patterns, flapping of hands, having lack of fear, not making eye contact, being inattentive and not responding are presented to us, we suspect it as autism and refer a detailed psychological analysis. The ones who had symptoms due to lack of social exposure bounce back once speech and other therapies are given.” In most cases children who exhibited autism-like signs were able to revert to normal behaviour. This is a sign that these kids did not have autism but had developed symptoms akin to the condition due to a lack of social exposure||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kids-developing-autism-like-symptoms/articleshow/87837160.cms||Amrita Didyala

As per crypto exchanges, India has around 1.5crore to 2crore investors. WazirX, that has over 10 million users with an overall trading volume of $38 billion, has seen an over 477% increase in signups from non-metro cities since January 2021. The few top non-metro states include Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. CryptocurrencyLive“Our data shows that women are early adopters of crypto. Tier-2 and tier-3 cities have driven almost 55% of total user signups on WazirX in 2021, overtaking tier-1 cities…We do have plans to launch in other popular languages in the future. We have made our tech scalable for all languages and it will be a simple effort to launch in any language we want in future,” a spokesperson from WaxirX said. Its blogs are already available in Hindi, Gujarati and Tamil and the crypto exchange will be adding more languages. Gaurav Dahake, CEO & Founder, Bitbns, pointed out that as cryptocurrency is emerging as a popular investment avenue, one of the major hurdles in crypto becoming a mainstream asset class is the lack of regional linguistic presence. “We are working towards building platforms in regional languages to assist crypto enthusiasts and investors across the country. Currently, Bitbns is available in Tamil and soon we will be coming up with more languages to cater to our audience pan India,” Dahake added. Sharan Nair, chief business officer, CoinSwitch, too added that the platform has seen over 100% growth in the number of users from non-metros since June 2020, month-on-month, led by tier-1 and tier-2 cities. “A typical user on our platform is more often than not a first-time investor, less than 28 years old and residing in a non-metro city. We are using vernacular mediums to educate people on benefits of investment, how to improve financial well-being, how to make informed decisions, how to start investing, what to research before investing,” he added. Even Raj Karkara, COO, ZebPay, said the exchange is seeing a surge in interest from across country with states such as Maharashtra, UP, Delhi, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Karnataka contributing to the majority of investor base.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/crypto-exchanges-net-tier-2-3-investors-in-their-languages/articleshow/87837175.cms||Swati Rathor

Theatres had welcomed patrons with roses when they trooped in soon after lockdown was lifted. Then the numbers didn’t pick up. Now, even a dozen people turning up gives theatre owners hope that it’s not curtains for them. But the message is on 70mm: cinema industry is in dire straits. There are more closed days than cinema screenings for theatres. With little income, theatre owners still have to keep everything in mint condition for that elusive audience. It costs about Rs 15,000-17,000 per day to maintain them in city, while in districts it may cost owners about Rs 12,000 per day. While the revenue, a film exhibitor bemoaned, was often not even Rs 2,500-3,000 per day. First Covid and then proliferation of OTT platforms is slowly acting as a drain for theatres. “Who would want to pay an unreasonable ticket price to watch a movie when the same can be watched several times on OTT for a fraction of the cost?” said Narasimha Rao of Film Goers Association. For last several years, Rao has been waging court battles against the industry on ticket pricing. On the other hand, the film industry has petitioned the government to allow them flexible ticket pricing, which is yet to get nod. On Friday, as many as eight films got released, but there was hardly any audience. “A film should also be well-publicised to draw audiences to theatres,” said former president of Telangana Film Chamber of Commerce, M Vijendar Reddy. But publicity costs money and films with a tight budget of Rs 3-4 crore would find it hard to cough up more in hard times. Publicity on television could cost anywhere between Rs Rs 60-70 lakh. Earlier, a producer confident about returns would seek 50-70% of revenues from theatre owners or else hire it for a fixed amount. Today, producers, distributors and exhibitors are playing blind at the negotiating table as there is no guarantee on audiences. Once, only a film’s fate was decided every Friday. Now, it’s the industry’s fate that’s on the line everyday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/theatres-reel-as-audience-flop-show-hits-films/articleshow/87837317.cms||---

He was speaking after inaugurating the ‘Pink Hope Day’ event, where cancer survivors shared their experiences, which was organised by HCG Bharath Hospital and Institute of Oncology, at its premises on Saturday. Hemantha Kumar said that 40% of the 133 crore population of the country are youths who are between 13 and 35. “To build a healthy nation, we should know how to prevent diseases and overcome them. Before HCG Bharath Hospital started in Mysuru, patients used to go to Bengaluru for treatment. The hospital in Mysuru has brought hope for patients, by providing quality treatment,” he said. District health officer Dr K H Prasad said that India is progressing in the health sector. “Due to the availability of advanced technologies and quality treatment, the lifespan of a person, which was 60 earlier, has now increased to around 67. Though there are 144 hospitals in Mysuru, Bharath Hospital is the only hospital exclusively for cancer patients. It has saved many precious lives,” he said. Sharing her experience, Devaki, a cancer survivor, said that she had very good health, and used to lead a healthy lifestyle.  “I was surprised when I was diagnosed with cancer. A positive attitude, self-confidence and determination are required to fight the disease. Through this group, we spread awareness among cancer patients,” she said. Similarly, Jayashree and Swamy, both cancer survivors, also shared their experiences. HCG BHIO chief radiation oncologist and medical superintendent Dr M S Vishveshwara said that the patients not only require treatment and advice, but also courage and confidence to undergo the treatment successfully. “Understanding the importance of this, we conduct support group discussions with the existing patients,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/to-build-healthy-nation-we-must-prevent-diseases-says-uom-vc/articleshow/87836526.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||First to close, last to open: Theatres still reeling under pandemic cloud||Hyderabad: If actor Nagarjuna became emotional on stage, barely able to control his joy, he had a reason. Fifty years ago, his father Akkineni Nagarjuna’s film produced by Suresh Productions ‘Premnagar’ was released. It was a watershed moment in the Telugu film industry. Nagarjuna was reminded of that at his son Naga Chaitanya’s film ‘Love Story’ which was released on the same day. The days coincided – 50 years apart. “There a cyclone 50 years ago but my father’s film went on to become a hit. Now, there is not just cyclone but also Covid-19 but my son’s film too became a hit. What more can I ask for,” Nagarjuna said. This ‘hit film’ directed by Shekhar Kammula can be seen as a speck in the ocean in the Telugu film industry since Covid-19 struck. Theatres were first to close. They were also the last to open after the lockdown was relaxed following a second wave. The Telugu film industry, as such, is yet to recover from the pandemic effect. “It has been debilitating. It has hit us real hard,” said film exhibitor Balgovind Raj Tadla, a partner of Sudershan 35 mm and Devi 70 mm theatres in the city. According to him, the average occupancy in theatres is not more than 30 per cent. “If I were to describe the situation, it is like a family recovering from the loss of a dear one. It takes time. Theatres have been most affected due to Covid-19 but there is something positive that we can see. We are hoping that there will be crowds thronging the cinemas from next month,” Balgovind, who is also secretary of Greater Hyderabad Exhibitors Association, said. According to an estimate, at least 20 films will be released in the next three months with a big star cast. A Balakrishna-starrer is expected to hit the screens in early December and big hopes are resting on it. During the thick of the pandemic, ‘Vakeel Saab’ starring Pawan Kalyan was the only big film which had a theatrical release. The movie also gave hope to the film industry that audiences would not hesitate to come to the theatres if a good fare was being dished out. “Content is king. There is no substitute to content. If a film is good, people will come to watch it. It is, of course, a fact that if there is a combination of big heroes-directors releasing their movies, there will be a bigger audience that will come to watch,” said film analyst Prabhu. “Covid-19 may have played spoilsport but if there is a film with quality, there will be an audience to watch,” he said. Prabhu pointed out that there was also a huge rush to make films for OTT platforms. “At any given time, at least 40 projects are being executed to produce films, specifically for OTT. This goes to show that the audience wants entertainment and they are willing to watch it. But they will not watch any stuff that is dished out,” he said. According to Prabhu, such is the quality demand even for OTT that project ideas are being rejected if they do not meet the quality requirement. Every week, several films are getting released on OTT platforms. Some films which have had a theatrical make their way on to OTT platforms after a small gap.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/first-to-close-last-to-open-theatres-still-reeling-under-pandemic-cloud/articleshow/87837327.cms||---

Such establishments are allegedly trying to get benefits of both multiplexes — charging higher ticket prices —, and standalone theatres — collecting parking fee. “The government is unnecessarily creating confusion by giving exemption to standalone theatres. Even multiples and malls are trying to collect parking fee now by showing this order,” said Vijay Gopal, founder of Forum Against Corruption. He added that the government order was in contempt of court which had prohibited collection of parking fee. Vijay Gopal has also submitted a representation on the issue to the principal secretary, home department and Hyderabad commissioner of police. He raised the issued of a theatre chain in the city collecting parking charges. “Sudha Theater is collection parking charges despite being a multiplex...This is illegal and looting citizens..” he tweeted, tagging various city police handles. In response, the handle for SHO Moghalpura (@sho_moghalpura) said, “...Sudha(cinepolis) is a standalone theatre that runs business only on cinemas and does not own any commercial complex in it. It has proper licence to collect parking fees.” However, the activist alleged that local police had failed to check Form-B of the establishment in question. He said that even if an establishment is registered as a single-screen, it should be considered a multiplex if it has more than three screens and demanded action be initiated against those violating the norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/multiplexes-playing-double-game-to-collect-parking-fee/articleshow/87837339.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

A man approached the ACB with a complaint that ASI Badaa Chauhan had on November 17 demanded Rs 10,000 as bribe for settling a case. The complainant had abducted a man from Madhya Pradesh as he had not paid Rs 1 lakh for settlement of a case as promised. When the man’s family approached Dahod Town police station, Chauhan called the complainant and asked him to produce the man he had abducted. On bringing the man to the police station, Chauhan intervened between the two parties and got them to reach a settlement. Later, Chauhan demanded Rs 20,000 from the complainant saying that he could have faced kidnapping charges. After negotiations, Chauhan agreed to accept Rs 10,000. But as the complainant did not want to pay the bribe, he approached ACB. ACB sleuths laid a trap and after the complainant gave the bribe amount to Chauhan inside the police station, ACB officials reached there and nabbed Chauhan red-handed. In another case, a jail sepoy was arrested for taking money from inmates at the time of their release on bail. ACB officials said that after receiving information about Hitesh Rabari’s corrupt practice they planted a decoy inmate in the sub-jail. When the decoy got the bail and he was about to leave the jail on Sunday, Rabari asked him to give him Rs 500. The decoy gave him a Rs 500 note and Rabari returned Rs 100 to him. ACB sleuths immediately entered Rabari’s cabin and arrested him along with the bribe money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/asi-jail-sepoy-caught-by-acb-in-graft-case/articleshow/87836318.cms||---

Six-term Congress MLA and former minister Dayaram Parmar (76) wrote to Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot asking him about the ‘eligibility criteria’ to be a minister so that he too can fulfill the same. Parmar, who represents Kherwara constituency in Udaipur, was minister in the previous two Gehlot governments. His letter to the CM was widely shared on social media. Speaking to TOI, Parmar said, “I have done MA and PhD and one of the current ministers is my student. I was minister for higher education from 2008 to 2010. But being a poor tribal man, I have been ignored this time despite my experience and commitment to the party... I have, therefore, humbly asked the chief minister to tell what eligibility I should acquire to be a minister.” The Gehlot ministry has none from Udaipur district, which has two Congress MLAs. Besides Parmar, the district has first timer Preeti Shaktawat, who won the bypoll last month. Congress MLA Johari Lal Meena from Alwar district also raised his dissent. "In our district, it is well known that Tikaram Juli is a corrupt man. His family is also involved in it. I asked the party leadership to remove him, but instead he has been promoted as cabinet minister. I am against it," Meena said. Juli responded by saying, "He (MLA Johari Lal Meena) is a senior leader of the party. I respect him but his allegations are totally baseless. He should come with proof, if he has any, to back his allegations." Congress MLA Shafia Zubair from the same district said, "Those with a bad reputation have been promoted. Overall, the new cabinet is not sending a good message. Women didn't get 33% reservation (in the cabinet)."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dissenting-voices-emerge-against-new-members-in-cms-council/articleshow/87837640.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Parikrama at Ambaji to start next year||AHMEDABAD: After undertaking the renovation and restoration work of the path leading from the pilgrimage town of Ambaji to the Gabbar hilltop, the temple authorities are now aiming to allow devotees to perform barefoot parikrama around the 51 Shakti Peeths whose replicas, in the form of temples and caves, have been built here few years ago. “We plan to allow pilgrims perform circumambulation of the 51 Shakti Peeths from February or March next year. This will perhaps be the first place where devotees of Maa Amba can take entire pilgrimage of the Shaktipeeths by way of parikrama,” said Anand Patel, collector of Banaskantha and chairman of Shri Arasuri Ambaji Mata Devasthan Trust (SAAMDT). He said that a final date will be announced after discussion with the Gujarat Pavitra Yatradham Vikas Board. By this time, the work on restoration of the footsteps, which have worn out over the years, will be complete. The unique project is created circumventing Gabbar Hills at Ambaji, by building lookalikes of all the 51 Shakti Peeths for a cost of about Rs 61.57 crore. The foundation stone for the project was laid in 2008 and the work of setting up 47 temple replicas and three caves was completed in 2014. According to the legend, visiting all the Shakti Peeths is like performing Ashvamegh Yagya. The parikrama is expected to take about three to four hours and the temple authorities are planning to allow pilgrims take this journey over a period of three to four days in a year. For the 51 Shakti Peeths, the temple priests were sent to these shrines of Goddess Amba to find out how the aarti rituals were carried out and to study the idols. According to the Indian scriptures, Gabbar Tirth, situated on the banks of river Saraswati in the hills of Arasur in Ambica forest is one of the 51 Shakti Piths in India. Devotees of Goddess Amba can undertake the entire pilgrimage of Shaktipeeths or temples as their replicas have been built about a decade ago, closer to the footsteps. The replicas include Hingula in Pakistan, Chattal, Kartopatat and Sugandha in Bangladesh, Indrakshi in Sri Lanka, Gandaki and Guhyashwori Peeth in Nepal and Mansarovar in Tibet. “Many devotees are not aware of the 51 Shakti Peeths and the parikarma will help spread a word about them. In future, we also plan to hold yagnas and carry out other religious activities at every Shakti Peeth in Ambaji,” according to Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/parikrama-at-ambaji-to-start-next-year/articleshow/87837201.cms||Bharat Yagnik

Around 50 trains were cancelled on Sunday since midnight while more than 50 were either diverted or partially cancelled. On Saturday too, as many trains were affected. Many took to social media to reach out to authorities. “Tirupathi to Hyderabad, very irresponsible adjustment to accomodate passengers by Railways. Passengers of 4 trains, with wrong information pushed into one train, we were told to change train in next station where the other train is kept (sic), but there was no train,” tweeted P Chandu (@pcdhyd), tagging senior rail authorities. The particular train was diverted between Padugupadu-Nellore.

The applicants alleged that they were dragged outside the centre for arriving late. Most of the applicants, mainly woman candidates, said that they were late as the state transport buses were out of service. Priyanka Patil from Shirala tehsil of Sangli district said, “I had opted for Kolhapur as the exam city since, for us, Sangli is too far away. We had to arrange for private transport to reach Kolhapur. We arrived on time, but nobody at the centre helped us locate the exam hall.” Over 17,000 applicants had registered for the TET exam at 30 centres in the city. The applicants claimed that as per the schedule provided to them by the Maharashtra State Council of Examination, the exam would start by 10am and they were to be let inside by 10.10am. However, at many centres, the entry gates were closed at 10am. The exam has been conducted after a gap of two years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-aspirants-denied-exam-hall-entry-for-being-late/articleshow/87837210.cms||---

For states with less than 100 cities, Uttarakhand ranked fourth nationally. But among the Himalayan states, it was on top followed by Himachal Pradesh and Nagaland. However, according to experts the comparison is not a fair one because of differences in the population margins of these states. “Himalayan states vary in terms of population numbers. While it is great that Uttarakhand has improved its ranking, we are a long way from ultimate success,” said Anoop Nautiyal, founder, SDC foundation. As reported by TOI earlier, the state capital has improved its ranking from 124 last year to 82 this year. Besides Dehradun, Roorkee and Rudrapur were among the other two cities to record a significant improvement in their ranking. In contrast, Haridwar, Haldwani and Kashipur had slipped from their earlier positions in this year’s Swachh Survekshan index. Among the 720 cities with less than 25,000 population, Uttarakhand’s Muniki Reti ranked 11 but experts believe that several state cities are at a very bad position for this to be a significant achievement. “It would be apt to describe the 2021 result as one step forward and one step backward for Uttarakhand. A bit of unfinished work remains for both authorities as well as citizens in the realm of waste management and cleaner cities,” said Nautiyal. Officials are happy with the state’s as well as Dehradun’s improvement in rankings. “We are working on several other strategies to improve the city further and make it even cleaner,” said Kailash Joshi, chief health officer, Dehradun Municipal Corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-best-among-10-himalayan-states-in-swachh-survekshan/articleshow/87836588.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

The incident was reported from Narsinghgarh village under the limits of Kunda police station of Pratapgarh district when a group of villagers including the family members of bride cordoned off a marriage party and started assaulting the visitors (marriage party). Police said that the tussle between two groups surfaced when people from marriage party continued to dance on DJ tunes for more than half an hour once the marriage procession reached the house of bride and family members of bride waited for welcome ceremony. Inspector (Kunda) Rakesh Bharatiya told TOI that a team of Kunda police rushed the spot when a groom identified as Raju, a resident of Madhwapur along with friends arrived Kunda police station with the complaint that some unidentified villagers had cordoned off the marriage party and assaulted few of them. He further added, “When the marriage party reached the marriage pandal site and family members of bride continued to wait for guests to welcome them, a group of people from marriage party continued to dance on DJ tunes despite repeated request to stop the DJ tunes and go for welcome ceremony of groom.” Police said that the groom was sitting inside the car and people from marriage party continued to dance for more than half an hour. When the people from bride site requested themarriage party to stop DJ tunes and come for welcome ceremony, a group fromgroom side, came at logger heads with bride side. This took no time between the two groups exchanged heated brawls and some of the villages from bride side cordoned the marriage party and assaulted a few guests on spot. After seeing trouble,the groom along with some friends escaped from the scene and reached straight to Kunda police station. In the meantime, Kunda police have already received the scuffle news and a police team was dispatched to solve the issue. Inspector, meanwhile, said that marriage was solemnized in presence of police. He also added that some people from both sides who were in inebriated state had exchanged heated arguments and caused trouble for others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/grooms-seeks-police-help-to-get-his-marriage-solemnized-in-pratapgarh-village/articleshow/87836591.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Human-tiger conflict due to limited connectivity: Study||Nagpur: One of the most functional corridors used by tigers in Kanha–Pench has high connectivity but this was not true for areas with very high levels of livestock predation by tigers. Results of a study by wildlife scientists show that when areas frequented by tigers are constrained by limited connectivity, there are higher chances of human-tiger conflict. The study — Links in a sink: Interplay between habitat structure, ecological constraints, and interactions with humans can influence connectivity conservation for tigers in forest corridors’ assessed potential connectivity across 10,000 sqkm of the Kanha–Pench forest corridor using graph-theoretic methods. The corridor connecting Kanha-Pench tiger reserves is a key conservation landscape in India, supporting several carnivores. The study was co-authored by Mahi Puri, University of Florida & Centre for Wildlife Studies (CWS), Arjun Srivathsa (University of Florida & Wildlife Conservation Society-India Program), Krithi K Karanth (CWS & Duke University), Imran Patel (CWS) and N Samba Kumar (CWS) appeared in the recent issue of the journal ‘Science of the Total Environment’. The scientists combined indirect sign surveys (documenting pugmarks and feces) to assess the patterns and factors influencing habitat use by tigers and occupancy models, and examined habitat use, and evaluated its congruence with potential connectivity. The estimated spatial probabilities of livestock depredation through the application of multi-state occupancy models to interview-based survey data from local residents. They further combined these results with information on livestock attacks by tigers gathered through 675 interview surveys of local communities. The objective of the study was to understand how human-tiger interactions influence the relationship between habitat connectivity and habitat use by tigers. “The Kanha-Pench landscape has been a high conservation priority landscape for over two decades. Although several studies have established the importance of this corridor, especially given the pressure from infrastructure development, the role of human-tiger interactions in mediating connectivity and habitat use by tigers has not been studied,” said Mahi Puri, the lead author of the study. “Our study found habitat fragmentation and human disturbance influenced habitat use by tigers. Areas that were highly used by tigers, but where connectivity was limited, were more likely to experience human-tiger conflict,” Puri added. “In multi-use landscapes, species’ interactions with humans could additionally influence connectivity. Using the tiger as a case study, we made simultaneous assessments of potential connectivity, habitat use and examine their links with the species' negative interactions with humans in Central India,” Puri said. Habitat use by tigers was negatively associated with forest fragmentation and anthropogenic disturbance. Livestock depredation was positively associated with the size of settlements and areas most frequented by tigers, and negatively with an anthropogenic disturbance within forests. India’s consistent conservation efforts have resulted in the population recovery of tigers in several regions of the country. But this has also caused increased interface between people and tigers, impacting rural livelihoods. Sustaining tiger numbers in the future would require efforts to consolidate corridors that connect populations while minimizing risks and losses to people living in these shared landscapes. Karanth, a co-author of the study, explains, “It is imperative that we address human-tiger conflict given the recovery of tiger populations in key landscapes such as the Kanha-Pench landscape. Fostering community support and reducing retaliation against multiple carnivores should be a priority.” The findings of the study present an opportunity to consolidate areas where carnivore conservation and local livelihood needs can be balanced. Our framework also provides a foundation for spatial prioritization that incorporates a plurality of dimensions, with utility for connectivity conservation of other wide-ranging carnivores. SHRINKING CORRIDORS * Loss of forest habitats and rapid infrastructure development has made it necessary to create functional wildlife corridors, especially for tigers * Scientists studied habitat connectivity and habitat use by tigers and examined its links with human-tiger conflict in Central India * Most areas used by tigers in the Kanha–Pench corridor had high connectivity * However, this was not true for areas with very high levels of livestock predation by tigers * Results show that when areas frequented by tigers are constrained by limited connectivity, there are higher chances of human-tiger conflict * Growth in human population, coupled with changes to natural habitat cover, led to expansion of agriculture and infrastructure development * Changes affect corridors and impede connectivity for wildlife * Creating and conserving wildlife corridors has been of interest to conservation scientists and wildlife managers||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/human-tiger-conflict-due-to-limited-connectivity-study/articleshow/87837212.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Statistics of the health department revealed that the dose gap between men and their women counterparts is currently 2.17 lakh while it was more than 3.2 lakh about three months back. Out of the total 40,35,073 doses given so far, as many as 21,25,440 men and 19,07,861 women have been given either one or both doses in the Prayagraj district. Officials, speaking on the number of women getting vaccinated, said, "The three weeks of November month again witnessed active participation from women beneficiaries for vaccination. Out of 4,41,424 doses given between November 1 and 21, as many as 2,34,274 women recipients received the doses, while the number of males getting vaccinated in the same period was 2,06,994. In October, out of the total 8,41,889 given doses, as many as 4,40,094 doses were given to women, while 4,01,428 doses were administered to men. However, the vaccination drive failed to break the records of September month, as a total of 9,39,300 given doses were given to eligible recipients in September, including 4,78,740 females and 4,60,002 males. Officials, meanwhile, claimed the pace of vaccination has once again picked up in rural areas after the festive season. With the Covid vaccination drive in the Prayagraj district, over 40,35,073 lakh jabs have already been inoculated to recipients of all age groups till November 21. Officials of the district health department have set a target to administer the Covid-19 vaccine to around 45.16 lakh beneficiaries, including 33 lakh recipients aged between 18 and 44 years, and 12.10 lakh beneficiaries aged over 45 years. As many as 40,35,073 Covid vaccine shots, including 21,25,440 males, 19,07,861 females and 1,772 transgender recipients of all age groups were administered doses till November 21. While 29,47,363 beneficiaries had taken the first dose of the vaccine, a total of 10,87,710 recipients had also received the second dose of the vaccine. Officials said the health department is making efforts to intensify vaccination exercises of all eligible recipients in every nook and corner in the Sangam city. Additional chief medical officer and district immunization officer (DIO) Dr Teerath Lal told TOI, over 65 per cent of targeted recipients of all age groups were at least given the first dose, while 24.4 per cent of targeted recipients are fully vaccinated till now. He also said that in the past three months, more women recipients are arriving at vaccination centres compared to their male counterparts to get jabs and the gap between male and female recipients is likely to close in fully in the coming days. The department has put its focus in rural areas for vaccination campaigns to cover all eligible recipients this month, he added. Dr Lal further said that ANM and AHSA workers have compiled the details of those eligible recipients who have not received a vaccine dose in villages and teams are taking up a door-to-door campaign in identified villages and blocks. “We aim that all eligible male and female recipients in all blocks of the district should be covered at the earliest under the vaccination drive," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/increasing-no-of-women-getting-inoculated-against-covid-is-helping-close-the-vaccination-gender-gap-in-prayagraj/articleshow/87836596.cms||---

As per official data, the tax recovery carried out till date is around 15% of the total target collection of Rs 576 crore set by the civic administration. Aparna Thete, in-charge of Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) tax-recovery, on Sunday said all defaulters including major ones should pay their dues at the earliest. “Those who owe large amount of dues can pay 50% of the total amount now and give post-dated cheques towards remaining payment. We appeal to the citizens to ensure timely and prompt payment of both property tax and water tax in order to avoid any unpleasant action,” she said. While the pandemic situation had affected the tax-recovery process last year, the civic authorities have taken more organised measures this year, including setting up of zone-wise squads to improve tax collection. Out of the total target recovery of Rs 576 crore, the civic administration is targeting recovery of Rs 468 crore towards property tax and Rs 108 crore towards water tax. As a part of its intensified tax recovery drive, the AMC has already started targeting major defaulters first. The crackdown saw sealing of 108 properties over non-payment of property tax and disconnection of water supply of six other major defaulters over a period of past one week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-civic-bodys-tax-recovery-reaches-15/articleshow/87837231.cms||---

---||Allahabad||6 days mega plan to cover vax recipients in 5 gram panchayats||Prayagraj: Ramping up vaccination drive in rural areas, officials of the health department have roped in teams of CHO (Community Health Officer) and ANMs (Auxilliary Nurse Midwife) separately and asked them to cover at least 50 recipients daily for the first dose in five gram panchayats witnessing lowest vaccination. District health authorities have taken up a six days mega plan to cover the eligible recipients in village from Monday, which would be effective till November 27. The campaign is being taken in all 23 blocks of the district and separate teams are taking up door-to-door vaccination. Officials said that after identifying at least five lowest vaccination gram panchayats in each and every block, teams have been asked to cover the eligible recipients who were somehow left for vaccination. Moreover, a war-room (group) has also been formed at each development block level and monitoring was being done by a senior administrative health official. A senior health official, meanwhile, said, “Health department has chalked out a micro plan, including formation of vaccination teams, survey of left recipients, public mobilization, routine monitoring, role and responsibilities of the vigilance committees to take up vaccination in rural belt of the district”. “Teams have also been roped in to motivate resistant families for vaccination,” he added. He also added that officials of health department were also coordinating with officials of district rural development agency, district panchayatraj officer, self-help groups, labour department, and ICDS to take the vax campaign effectively in rural areas. “Ground health workers – ANMs and ASHAs- are visiting each and every house in villages of all blocks as per the scheduled dates and finding out the details of the recipients who aren’t vaccinated yet,” said district immunizationofficer (DIO) and additional chief medical officer (ACMO) Dr Teerath Lal, adding, “The entire exercise has yielded fruitful results and health teams have ramped up vaccination in gram panchayat with lowest vaccinations.” Till now, over 40.35 lakh doses have already been given so far, including 21.25 lakh men and 19.07 lakh women (either first or both doses), in the Prayagraj district. Moreover, the three weeks of this month has also witnessed active participation from fairer sex for vaccination and this was aptly proved by the facts that out of 4,41,424 doses given between November 1-21, as many as 2,34,274 women recipients received the doses, while thenumber of male counterparts was restricted to 2,06,994. Officials of the district health department have set a target to administer covid-19 vaccine to around 45.16 lakh beneficiaries, including 33 lakh recipients aged between 18-44 years, and 12.10 lakh beneficiaries aged over 45 years.

Similarly, in eight ULBs, less than 10 lease deeds were issued. This was highlighted after the department reviewed the progress. “In past 55 days, over 1 lakh lease deeds have been issued. There are some small municipal corporations and councils which have failed to perform. Surprisingly, the list includes Alwar and Nasirabad. We will soon call a meeting of officials and resolve the issues and challenges which they are facing,” said a senior urban development and housing (UDH) department official. Among all the local bodies, the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) has issued highest number (14,884) of lease deeds to the plot owners. It is followed by the urban improvement trust (UIT), Kota and Udaipur, where 5,605 and 4,246 lease deeds have been issued, respectively. The worst performance was recorded at the Sawai Madhopur, UIT where only 14 lease deeds were issued. Similarly, Barmer and Bikaner, UIT has only issued 52 and 33 lease deeds, respectively. An official said, there are 213 (ULBs), which includes municipality, council, corporations, development authorities, UITs . “No municipal corporation including Jaipur has made it to top five list. In Bikaner, only 13 lease deeds have been issued,” said an official. The state government recently launched the ambitious six-month special campaign, ‘Shahar-2021’ to issue lease deeds. However, the plan was stalled after Rajasthan High Court banned the regularisation of illegal colonies in cities without having zonal and sector plan. The government aimed to issue 10 lakh lease deeds during the campaign. The major attraction of the campaign was regularisation of colonies on agriculture land. It is estimated that about 7-8 lakh houses partially or fully constructed on agriculture land need title deeds. Sources said, “After the court order, the government cannot issue lease deeds on promised 70% plots.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/10-urban-local-bodies-fail-to-give-single-lease-deed/articleshow/87968752.cms||---

The students depend on MSRTC buses to commute to schools and colleges located in taluka and district headquarters. “I must travel to Sinnar for college and now there is no bus available. I will have to take unnecessary breaks again,” said Sangita Sangle, a student of Class X from a village in Sinnar taluka. The students from rural areas faced connectivity issues while taking online classes. Now, even though schools and colleges reopened, the MSRTC strike added to their woes. “We asked the government to start physical schools for children of Class X and IX to make learning easier. The state government should have already taken steps to resolve this issue,” said Shankar Mhaisdhune, a parent from Niphad taluka. Travelling daily by taxi is costly as their fares have jumped twofold. “If the strike continues for more than four days, it will cause problems for students as the prelims are nearing,” said Prajakta Mali, a resident of Chandwad taluka. Similar is the case around Nashik city, as due to the bus strike, students would not be able to reach the city to attend schools or colleges. The students from Trimbakeshwar, Saikheda, Ozhar, Sinnar, Bhagur and Girnare can travel by buses run by Nashik Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (NMPML), which travel up to 25km from the borders of Nashik city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/msrtc-staff-strike-may-cause-problems-for-schools-students-too/articleshow/87837254.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Hyderabad||Two Deccanis call it a day, but show goes on||Hyderabad: Hyderabadi filmi humour and Deccani lingo received a major setback last week when two famous Deccanis called it a day. If film actor Adnan Sajid Khan brought humour to every Hyderabadi household through his unique but comic character Gullu Dada, young rapper Ruhan Arshad put Hyderabadi, Deccani or Urdu rap onto the international platform of modern music through his melodic yet forceful rendition Miya Bhai. Both may have quit for different reasons bringing an abrupt end to two major Hyderabadi characters, Gullu Dada and Miya Bhai, but their sudden decision has definitely jolted the Hyderabadi dialect, popularised in the last two decades through Hyderabadi cinema and YouTube. Though their exit would not put an end to Hyderabadi lingo on big screen or cyberworld, it had created a huge vacuum that would take a long time to fill. Adnan brought curtains down on Gullu Dada, a character he first played in Deccani or Dakhni film, FM or Fun aur Masti, in 2007. Gullu Dada, a local don, had endeared the Dakhni audience through his comic actions and humorous dialogues in Dakhni or Hyderabadi Urdu so much so that Gullu Dada now runs a Hyderabadi biryani restaurant. Adnan said he had quit the Hyderabadi film industry, though he would continue with the film industry in general. The reason Adnan had cited for quitting the Hyderabadi film industry is really disheartening. The Dakhni films he had acted did not receive the expected cash flow, causing loss to producers. “I do not want to cause loss to my producers,” he said in a recorded video message on why he was quitting the popular Gullu Dada character. Ruhan, who became a household name through his Miya Bhai rap with over 50 crore views on YouTube, said he was quitting the music industry for religious reasons. But, then there is a group of Dakhni rappers, who thrive after giving rap the spiritual touch. In fact, one can say Hyderabadi rap has evolved spiritually too to keep the orthodox section happy. Urdu or Dakhni rappers Mudassir Ahmed and Syed Irshad, popular with YouTube names Mo Boucher and Irish Boi respectively, gave Hyderabadi rap a Sufi touch. Miya Bhai and Gullu Dada though Hyderbadi in attire and attitude are characters apart. While Gullu Dada is a local villain with his own gang of goondas, his actions are sure to leave one in raptures, Miya Bhai is a young Hyderabadi lad but dreams big even as he spends the fortune of his forefathers. Last Id-ul-Fitr, Ruhan joined hands with film actor Salman Khan and sang ‘Bhai Bhai’ rap emphasising the need for communal harmony and religious tolerance. It was also an instant hit like the Miya Bhai rap. Hyderabadi Urdu or Dakhni like Hyderabadi cuisine has a flavour of its own. Though introduced to the Deccan region from the north, Dakhni or Deccani imbibed the local languages to carve out its distinct dialect with its own vocabulary, quite different from the Urdu of the north. There’s a subtle difference still between Dakhni and Urdu though many do not see major differences, says Dr Mohammad Safiullah honorary director of Raja Dhanraj Gir Institute of Deccani. Safiullah recalls how Basalat Jah, son of Nizam VI Mir Mahbub Ali Khan, would speak to him in Dakhni. Dakhni was popularised by Mohammad Quli Qutub Shah through his poetry. Mohammad Quli was the founding father of Hyderabad and the man behind the iconic Charminar. Then came poets like Mah Laqa Chanda, the first woman poet to publish an anthology in Urdu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/two-deccanis-call-it-a-day-but-show-goes-on/articleshow/87837251.cms||Syed Akbar

The organisers of the festival had asked the civic body to provide financial assistance of Rs 50 lakh for successful conduct of the event. But considering the drop in the revenue of the civic body through various taxes, the civic administration has decided to provide a financial assistance of Rs 25 lakh for the literary festival. The state government’s permission is mandatory for donating over Rs 3 lakh. Municipal commissioner Kailas Jadahv told reporters that a proposal for donating Rs 25 lakh to the organisers of the literary festival has been sent to the state government for approval. “The financial assistance will be provided immediately once the state government gives its nod,” he said. Mayor Satish Kulkarni has promised the Akhil Bhartiya Sahitya Sammelan to provide all necessary help from the civic body to make the literary festival a success. The literary festival is to be held under the guidance of the noted astrophysicist Jayant Narlikar. Meanwhile, the bhoomipujan of ‘Kusumagraj Nagri’ in Bhujbal Knowledge City — slated to host the three-day event — was performed by district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal and Kulkarni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-keen-to-provide-financial-help-for-literary-fest/articleshow/87837265.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Hyderabad||Telangana govt issues order for post-mortem after sundown||HYDERABAD: To comply with new protocols of the Union ministry of health and family welfare for conducting post-mortem after sunset, the Telangana government on Sunday issued a notification to allow the procedure post sundown asking teaching hospitals across the state to ensure necessary arrangements are made. These include ensuring fitness of infrastructure, ensuring that there is no dilution of evidentiary value, video recording of all post-mortems done at night and post-mortem for organ donation etc. Post-mortem after sunset has been allowed by the Centre from November 15. “Apart from the convenience of the family of the deceased, this new procedure also promotes organ donation and transplant as organs can be harvested in the stipulated time window after the procedure. The technical committee of the ministry of health and family welfare suggested that due to rapid advancement and improvement in technology, especially availability of required lighting and infrastructure required for post-mortem, performing night time post-mortem in the hospitals is now feasible,” the order said. Apart from ensuring fitness and adequacy of infrastructure, the principal or superintendent would be responsible to make necessary arrangements for post-mortem after sunset. “It is also to be ensured by the hospital that video recording of post-mortem shall be done for all post-mortems conducted in night to rule out suspicion and preserved for future reference for legal purposes,” the order said. Post-mortem for organ donation will be taken up on priority and done even after sunset at hospitals having infrastructure for conducting such post-mortems on a regular basis. However, cases under categories such as homicide, suicide, rape, decomposed bodies and suspected foul play must not be subjected for post-mortem during night unless there is a law and order situation,” the order issued by director medical education Dr K Ramesh Reddy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-govt-issues-order-for-post-mortem-after-sundown/articleshow/87837257.cms||---

The pandemic pause stretched two seasons of this beloved and rich local theatrical tradition of Chandrapur, Gondia, Bhandara, and Gadchiroli districts. Zadipatti season starts after Diwali and continues till March. This year, as the pandemic receded and the state government allowed theatrical shows, Zadipatti was the first to resume in state and with doubled enthusiasm. “We were sceptical about the public response earlier. Now, two weeks have passed since Diwali. Public response is overwhelming. I am sure that the theatre will hit its original glory in next two months. We can expect record breaking collections this time,” said Sadanand Borkar, veteran of Zadipatti. Affordable tickets and jam-packed shows are two special features of Zadipatti theatre, and both are visible despite the testing times of pandemic. One can get a ticket as cheap as Rs15 for one full-time play here. In Rs50, you can see back to back shows. As takers are in thousands, collection from plays easily surpasses the five-figure mark. Plays having artistes from Nagpur and Mumbai with some television and cinema backgrounds collect even more. “We have entered two brand new plays this year. Shows are in high demand. It’s pure love of these people towards theatre and nothing else. We have back-to-back shows scheduled across the Zadipatti region and I am all excited,” said Rajesh Chitnis, senior actor and director, who is from Nagpur. Many actors from Nagpur’s amateur theatre, and some who are struggling for work in professional stage in Mumbai and Pune, spend months in Zadipatti. “This experience is not just training for a lifetime but also earning for the entire year, which enables us to continue our struggle in Mumbai,” said a young artiste. Deva Kawale, vice president of the Akhil Zadipatti Natya Kalawant Parishad, told TOI that booking enquiries started for Zadipatti theatre in October itself. “I think Zadipatti was the first commercial theatre to start after pandemic. As soon as the government allowed shows, we started getting enquiries. You can see full house in Desaiganj Wadsa, Palaspani, Navargaon, Antargaon, Lakhni and all places across the Zadi region,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/zadipatti-theatre-restarts-with-pomp-after-pandemic/articleshow/87837260.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Hyderabad||Liquor licence draw: Businessmen offer Rs 2 crore for each shop in Telangana's Khammam||HYDERABAD: The next general assembly elections, as well as the anticipated high volume of sales, have prompted some liquor retailers to offer up to Rs 2 crore in goodwill for each shop to individuals who won the licence draw in Khammam district. These retailers want to open stores in their name, assuming profitable sales in the next two years. “Many were approached to sublease their licences, particularly in reserved quotas. Some were offered Rs 2 crore as goodwill for the shop in the category of Rs 60 lakh licence fees, some have given back their licences and some were confused,” a source close to liquor lobbying revealed. Depending on the location and previous sales in that area, the goodwill price ranged from Rs 1 crore to Rs 2 crore. The lobbyists have worked hard this time to obtain licences, with some filing more than 100 applications for some outlets. “Most of these people have been in the business for a long time, and some of them are close to political parties too,” they said. On the other hand, many Telangana businessmen concentrated on bidding for shops with belt shops. Negotiations for an increase in the number of applications have been ongoing in recent days. Most of this lobbying took place in Khammam district, which received approximately 7,000 applications for only 217 shops. Sources also said that 50% of the applications came from Andhra Pradesh businessmen. According to an analysis, sales in village-level shops in the state average around Rs 10 crore, with a shop in Jubilee Hills having the highest annual turnover of Rs 60 crore. According to the guidelines, no draws will be held for shops that receive fewer than 10 applications, so the lucky draw for 63 shops has been postponed. Interestingly, the district of Medchal Malkalgiri in Hyderabad’s suburbs had the most shops where the draw was halted due to a lack of applications.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/liquor-licence-draw-bizmen-offer-rs-2-crore-for-each-shop/articleshow/87837275.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Thiruvananthapuram||It was child trafficking: Anupama||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The petitioner in the controversial child adoption row, Anupama S Chandran, has demanded that a criminal case be registered against Kerala state council for child welfare (KSCCW) general secretary Shiju Khan for aiding human trafficking. The child, who was handed over for foster care with an Andhra couple, has been brought back to the capital on Sunday and has been housed at Nirmala Shishu Bhavan at Palayam. “We have come to know that there is no license for the committee for giving children on adoption. Without a license, it is nothing but child trafficking. After colluding for all such illegal things and pushing another innocent couple also into distress, it is surprising why the police is not registering a criminal case against Shiju Khan. I will not even think of ending the protest till a case is registered,” she said, adding that she will approach the chief minister seeking action against Khan. It is learnt that the KSCCW’s license issued by the state adoption regulatory authority to function as an adoption agency had expired in 2016 itself, and it had failed to produce the renewed license before the family court which is considering the case. Meanwhile, the team consisting of police officials and officials of KSCCW that had left for Andhra Pradesh brought back the child to the state on Sunday late evening. The team took custody of the child from the Andhra couple from Vijayawada, for whom the child was given for temporary adoption as part of the legal adoption process. The child welfare committee (CWC), Thiruvananthapuram, had ordered the KSCCW on November 17 to bring back the child within five days. A DNA test will be conducted after collecting samples from the child as well as Anupama and her partner B Ajith Kumar. The test will be conducted at the Rajiv Gandhi Biotechnology Centre, from where the results are expected within two days. Once the results reveal that the child belongs to Anupama and Ajith Kumar, the child will be handed over to them. Till then, the child will be under the care and protection of the district child welfare officer. Anupama has been on an indefinite strike in front of the KSCCW.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/it-was-child-trafficking-anupama/articleshow/87836662.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Roadside parking, street vendors ruin charm of Mussoorie’s iconic Mall Road, say residents||Mussoorie: Unregulated parking of cars and plying of commercial vehicles throughout the day on Mussoorie’s iconic Mall Road, with encroachment by street vendors and heavy traffic flow, have ruined the road's traditional charm, say residents and some tourists.“Till 1990s, the Mall Road used to be so neat and clean, without any encroachment. It is now merely a shadow of its past,” said Parikshit Kumar from Delhi, who has been visiting the Queen of the Hills and its famous Mall Road for many years. Residents also complain that mushrooming street vendors on the road stretch are adding to the problem. “Street vendors occupy a major portion of the Mall Road and their numbers are increasing while roadside parking by residents as well as tourists is on the rise. It is leading to congestion on the Mall and affecting its peace and beauty,” says Shalabh Garg, a resident. Hugh Gantzer, a member of the Supreme Court panel constituted by the apex court to monitor environment issues of Doon Valley and Mussoorie, recalled that in the past there was no movement of vehicles on the Mall Road and "zero encroachment". “Even the then Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru never used a vehicle on the Mall. But sadly, times have changed,” Gantzee said. "Roadside parking used to be banned, commercial vehicles were not allowed on the Mall and encroachments would be regulated by the Mussoorie Municipal Council (MMC). However, there is no proper law and order these days,” added a resident, who wished not to be named. Reacting to the issue, circle officer Narendra Pant said, "Regular challans of vehicles parked illegally on the Mall are being carried out. In the coming month, we would deploy additional people and ensure that no vehicles are kept at ‘no parking zones’ on the Mall." Meanwhile, MMC executive officer Vijay Chauhan said that there are plans to create zones for relocation of street vendors and measures are being taken for the installation of CCTV cameras and public announcement system for better management of the Mall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/roadside-parking-street-vendors-ruin-charm-of-mussoories-iconic-mall-road-say-residents/articleshow/87836651.cms||Anmol Jain
---||Nagpur||Buck stops with Guv, say MVA netas on devp boards delay||Nagpur: The contentious issue of reconstitution of statutory development boards once again came to fore after leader of opposition in assembly, Devendra Fadnavis, accused Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of “murdering” them. The boards in Vidarbha, Marathwada and Rest of Maharashtra have become dysfunctional after the tenure of their members expired on April 30, 2020, and no efforts were made to appoint new ones. While addressing the BJP workers in Mumbai recently, Fadnavis had said that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray-led government holds a grudge against backward regions of Vidarbha and Marathwada. The ruling dispensation, however, has squarely blamed governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari for the inordinate delay in reconstitution of these boards. Even former board members think the buck stopped with the governor. During his recent visit to Chandrapur, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar had said the experience with these boards and the outcome was not too satisfactory. “The boards were expected to be beneficial for the people and administration, but they failed in the purpose. Therefore, further discussions on their reconstitution were not taken forward (by the government),” Pawar had said. Refuting the allegations by Fadnavis, energy minister Nitin Raut told TOI that the buck stops with the governor “who should have taken an initiative in this regard”. “The MVA government is more than willing to reconstitute the boards for a long time, but there is no move from the governor being a statutory authority. The MVA government has no role to play in any delay in this matter,” he said. According to water resources minister Jayant Patil, unless Koshyari approved 12 names sent by the government for nomination to MLC posts, they would not start the process for reconstitution of boards. “He is sitting on those names for over a year now. It is unprecedented for the governor’s office to hold back the file containing names coming from arts, science, social work, literature and other fields,” he told TOI. Endorsing Patil’s views, senior NCP leader Praful Patel said the governor must understand that these important boards are not being reconstituted due to him. “The government is not at fault. The governor, holding the constitutional post, should not have sat over the file containing the 12 names,” he said. Top lawyer Firdos Mirza, an expert in Constitutional matters, offered a different perspective. According to him, President of India Ramnath Kovind didn’t extend boards’ tenure after it was lapsed, and, therefore, neither the government nor governor can do anything to reconstitute them. “As per Article 371 (2) of the Constitution, the government can’t do anything unless permission for extension came from the country’s highest office. The last extension was granted by late President Pranab Mukherjee on April 30, 2015. After that no order was issued for their extension and hence their tenure was lapsed on April 30, 2020. In view of the President's first order of 1994, these boards can’t remain as legal entities unless new orders come. Now, the governor has no powers to reconstitute them,” Mirza told TOI. Former Vidarbha Statutory Board member Kapil Chandrayan said since the President of India granted powers to the governor for reconstitution of boards, he should have taken initiative in this regard without waiting for the government. “Earlier, the governor’s secretary used to write to the chief secretary on the expiry of board members’ tenure and new members used to be appointed. In another way, the cabinet used to table the issue in the assembly which used to ratify its decision and send it to the governor for approval. It had not taken place this time. The government never wanted these boards to stay, but the governor should have initiated the process,” Chandrayan, who also had filed a PIL in the Nagpur bench of Bombay High court in this regard, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/buck-stops-with-guv-say-mva-netas-on-devp-boards-delay/articleshow/87837270.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

She said that the accused extorted Rs 2,500 cash from her. The woman, 22, who is a resident of Film Nagar in Banjara Hills, lodged a complaint with police alleging that she used to go for evening walks regularly at KBR Park and would walk on the outer walkway, but stopped doing so after she was assaulted on November 2 evening opposite to a news channel building on Road No. 92 of Jubilee Hills. “An unknown person came from behind. He caught hold of my waist and dragged me into the bushes,” the complainant said. Police said that the accused molested the complainant and demanded sexual favours from her if she does not give him money. “The victim gave the accused the Rs 2,500 cash she had with her and started screaming for help. The accused tried to close her mouth while threatening to kill her but the victim managed to push him aside and escape,” Banjara Hills police said. Disturbed by the assault, the victim went to her native place in Andhra Pradesh, but later returned to the city and lodged a complaint. Police suspect that K Babu, 21, the person arrested for robbing the actress, could be the same person who assaulted the complainant in the latest case. As Babu already confessed to having committed another similar offence in January 2021 at KBR Park, police are planning to seek his custody to interrogate him. “We will seek his custody to find out if he had committed more such offences,” a cop from Banjara Hills police station said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/woman-molested-at-kbr-park-lodges-complaint/articleshow/87837272.cms||---

The appointments are apparently to contain discontent as they played key roles in Gehlot fighting the rebellion last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/6-mlas-become-gehlots-advisors/articleshow/87837668.cms||---

This time however, ticketing issues have cut short his Iffi sojourn to just three days. “This is the first time I am experiencing difficulties in getting a ticket. I have not watched a single film on the first day and tickets for the second day are already fully-booked. I tried booking online, but when I logged in, the tickets were exhausted. Wasting my time sitting outside the multiplex all day is pointless,” he said. With Kala Academy under repairs, and only 50% seating capacity allowed at the Inox screens in Panaji and Porvorim due to the pandemic, the auditoria were expected to be booked sooner than usual. However, with the online booking window opening at midnight, the tech-savvy delegates managed to book tickets for their movie of choice a day in advance while those that showed up at the festival venue – especially senior citizens – were left with no choice but to return home upon finding absolutely no tickets to avail of for November 21 and 22. “When I arrived at the booking counter in the morning, I was informed that only two shows’ tickets are available for the second day and that there is no system of spot booking. I had no choice but to book whatever was available for Monday while I returned home on Sunday without any screenings,” said Sachin Kadam, another delegate from Pune. Even local movie aficionados are not spared. Ponda resident Maya Kakodkar visited the festival venue along with her husband and daughter and neither of the three were able to book tickets online. “We didn’t know that physical tickets were not being issued. It is very difficult to get online tickets which is why we drove all the way here. We were forced to return home on the first day without watching any films,” Kakodkar said. Meanwhile, an official from the Entertainment Society of Goa (ESG) said that they are contemplating solutions to help senior citizens or non-tech-savvy delegates with the ticketing process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tech-glitch-with-ticketing-ruins-fest-for-senior-citizens/articleshow/87837291.cms||Nida Sayed

---||Mumbai||MSRTC strike: Protesters in Mumbai to intensify stir||MUMBAI: As the MSRTC strike enters its 26th day on Monday, Mumbai is likely to see a huge turnout of protesters from other districts arriving in the city and heading for Azad Maidan to intensify the stir, union sources said. “It [MSRTC] is the cheapest mode of transport for those in small towns and villages and far-flung suburbs of Mumbai,” said passenger rights activist from Kasara, Vishwanath Dhatrak. He added that the state transport (ST) is the common man’s vehicle. “People cannot afford private buses or autos, which are charging twice the usual fare,” he added. Many depended on ST in Vasai-Virar, Karjat-Kasara-Khopoli and Pen-Panvel areas. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Sunday urged the striking ST employees to not inconvenience commuters and take back their strike. “Everything can be solved through discussion. There are some leaders who, under the garb of supporting the strike, are instead instigating them,” said Pawar. Transport minister Anil Parab said that he had a meeting with the union which had given the notice for the strike and said that Bombay high court has already given its directions to set up a committee and has given powers to the committee to study the merger issue and submit its proposal to the state. “The state will take a positive view of the report submitted by the committee...,”he said. State minister Balasaheb Thorat said that the BJP which has sold off Air India and is in the process of selling other government-owned entities has no right to speak about the ST strike. “They are only misleading the employees for their political interests,”said Thorat. Commuters took to social media to say that union leaders can put forth their demands before the government, but drivers and conductors should not stop running buses. A tweet by @Neha74072970 said: "In Maharashtra, many ST staff strike the middle-class people, they are unable to reach their workplace, please do something." Another by @BhaiyaSavage mentioned: " ST staff, don't be a puppet for dirty politicians, let's get back to work for our country." A tweet by @guddaa_1994 said: "ST staff we understand your problems but please take a moment and think about the common man who is suffering from this strike."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/msrtc-strike-protesters-in-mumbai-to-intensify-stir/articleshow/87837920.cms||Somit Sen
---||Mysuru||Vaccination of livestock to protect against foot-and-mouth disease in full swing||Mysuru: The department of animal husbandry and veterinary sciences has taken up a vaccination drive against the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), for more than 5.2 lakh livestock on a war footing, in Mysuru district this year. The second round of the month-long drive, which was delayed due to the pandemic, began on November 8 and it will be completed by December 8. The first round of this drive was held between February and March this year. Like the Pulse Polio immunisation drive, health workers are visiting door-to-door, to cover the livestock population of 5,16,260, in all the villages in seven taluks of the district. Instructions have been given to local assistant director level officials of all the taluks, to vaccinate livestock, including cows, bulls, buffaloes, sheep, goats, and pigs during the drive, after taking the help of local veterinary inspectors and their assistants. Apart from 265 animal husbandry department employees, the department has also utilised the services of 26 volunteers from the Karnataka Milk Federation, as well as taking the help of the Milk Producer Cooperative Society secretary and employees, to ensure that the drive is a success. The department has set the target to cover 80 cattle heads every day, to complete the drive within a month. The department have kept the vaccines in taluk level department office coolers. They can be collected from their daily, in order to inoculate livestock. Deputy director of animal husbandry and veterinary sciences Dr B N Shadkswaramurthy, said last year the district had registered 12 cattle deaths from FMD, and compensation was given to the owners of these animals, as per the norms of the government. The department had received reports that some farmers are reluctant to bring their bovine animals for vaccination, as they fear that it will cause adverse health effects for them. However, he said that it is crucial to get cattle vaccinated for FMD, because if they get infected, there is a huge loss in milk production in these animals, and they become unproductive. “If a cow gets infected with FMD, it becomes very difficult for the animal to conceive, and it may soon become infertile. In case of bulls, their strength is affected, and the animal becomes infertile. Likewise, it also affects sheep and goats in villages,” he said. “This is the second round of vaccination, since the FMD vaccination programme started in the district. It is a central government-funded programme, that is going on nationwide. It will be held once every six months. As the vaccination drive is free of cost, farmers must vaccinate their cattle to safeguard them from FMD,” he said. “As cattle from near the fringes of forests are taken to forest areas for grazing, and there is a chance of spreading FMD to wild animals, in order to prevent it, the forest department will hold camps regularly in villages on the fringes of the forests, along with the veterinary science department, to vaccinate bovine animals once every six months. Moreover, the Union and state government had given clear-cut instructions to hold such camps regularly,” said V Edukondalu, deputy conservator of forests, MM Hills sanctuary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/vaccination-of-livestock-to-protect-against-foot-and-mouth-disease-in-full-swing/articleshow/87836594.cms||---

Kerala Hotel and Restaurants Association (KHRA), in a petition to the chief minister and the state police chief, demanded that those behind the false propaganda should be booked under cyber laws. KHRA state general secretary G Jayapal said that it is unfortunate that police haven’t taken action against those behind the fake campaign. He said KHRA has approached authorities seeking action against the campaign against Paragon group of restaurants, and other eateries by dragging their name in the campaign over ‘spit food’ and ‘spit-free food’ on social media. The social media campaign had stated that 15 restaurants in Kozhikode were serving ‘spit-free’ food. The false propaganda owed its origin to a forwarded video on social media accusing a Muslim cleric of ‘spitting to make food halal’. But fact-checking news sites had refuted the charge. Jayapal said in the latest instance, a section had carried out a social media campaign asking people to not eat food from restaurants belonging to a particular religion. “This has become a serious issue that will deepen communal divide in state. People should isolate those who are trying to reap political gains by spreading communal poison in society,” he said. Meanwhile, BJP state president K Surendran said that there was a clear agenda to create a halal culture in state. Addressing the media on Sunday, he said the halal campaign was being carried out by religious extremists to divide people in the name of food and clothes. “Halal phenomenon has spread its roots in Kerala over a short period of time. It is not an innocent development. It is part of a planned move to divide people and create conflicts in the name of religion,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/hotel-owners-ask-govt-to-take-legal-action/articleshow/87836688.cms||---

For the first time, more non-feature than feature films will be screened under this section. Konkani film ‘Gagan’, directed by Supraj Kerkar and produced by Brijesh Kakodkar is a 24-minute short-film that speaks of the broken relationship between a father and son. ‘Limits’ is a Marathi film of 36-minute duration, produced and directed by Vardhan Kamat.

We also built track and trolley within eight days to shoot this film. The film is shot at three different places and the shoot was completed within three days. It is of five one-take scenes and hence coordination of every cast and crew member was crucial,” Kamat said. ‘Limits’ revolves around two female protagonists, Neha and Manasi, working in corporate jobs in a metropolitan city of India and representing the same generation yet different ideologies about work-life balance, freedoms and restrictions. ‘Kupamcho Daryeo’, a 19-minute film in Konkani directed by Himanshu Singh and produced by Kishor Arjun Shinde will also be screened at Iffi’s Goan film section. ‘D’Costa House’ will be the only feature film to be screened in the section.

The Mahabhisheka was conducted by members of Bettada Balaga Charitable Trust, who have been conducting the event for nearly two decades. Volunteers of Bettada Balaga, who are a group of walkers and joggers frequenting Chamundi Hills, organize the Mahabhisheka for the 350-year-old statue on during Karthika Masa. This is the sixteenth year the group had organized the annual event. Due to Covid-19, the event was kept simple but traditional. Even scaffolding was not erected around the statue. Sri Adhichunchanagiri Mahasamsthana Mutt Mysuru branch seer Somanatha Swami and Hosamata seer Chidananda Swami performed special puja as part of the Mahabhisheka. The monolithic statue was cleaned and priests anointed the statue with 38 different ingredients like water, milk, curd, lemon juice, sugarcane juice, tender coconut water, sandalwood paste, grapes, kumkum, turmeric, ghee, red sander, various flours of dal, dry fruits, fruits, ashtagandha and coins. The statue, the third biggest Nandi statue in the country, is believed to have been installed by Mysuru ruler Dodda Devaraja Wadiyar in the 17th century. The statue is 15 feet tall and 20 feet wide and has been carved from a single stone. The statue was installed near the 700th of the 1008 steps which lead to the summit.

The minister was addressing a gathering after launching Nashik city’s first electric car rental service — an initiative of three women entrepreneurs. Bhujbal said there has been a rise in number of vehicles on the road and they cause more pollution than the industries. “Fortunately, the air quality of Nashik city is good, but rise in petrol and diesel-based vehicles may increase the pollution level of the city. It is not possible to replace all vehicles with electric ones, but those going to buy new vehicles may opt for electric vehicles,” he said. According to mayor Satish Kulkarni, who was also present at the event, the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) is creating charging points for electric vehicles at 20 different places to encourage people choose electric vehicles. The entrepreneurs — Heena Shah, Ruchi Bhatia and Shraddha Madhaiya — took the initiative to roll out city’s first electric cab services. Initially, the private firm will have a fleet of 10 vehicles and will start commercial operation from December 10. Initially, the electric vehicles will be used to ferry delegates to and from the city to the venue of the 94th Akhil Bhartiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan that is around 10-km away from Nashik city. People may book the rental electric car services through the designated mobile application or portal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/bhujbal-bats-for-electric-vehicles-to-fight-pollution/articleshow/87837319.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Rajkot||Six booked for siphoning of diesel worth Rs 17.6 lakh from tankers||RAJKOT: Six persons including two employees of an oil refining company in Jamnagar were booked on Saturday for running a racket of stealing diesel from fuel tankers. According to the complaint given by the company’s shift supervisor, the truck drivers and cleaners identified as Rajpalsinh Gohil, Bhagirathsinh Gohil, Rahul Dangar and Brijrajsinh Chudasama had started the stealing with the help of two field executives of the company – Nikunj Patel and Mayur Valand. Patel and Valand were responsible to check that the tankers that come for loading of petrol and diesel in the company do not have any leakages. If the tankers had leakages, the fuel was unloaded and the tankers sent back. The duo took advantage of their positions and asked four of their accomplices to create leakage in the tankers and come for fuel loading. When Bhagirathsinh and Rajpalsinh took their tanker, Patel and Valand, after the tanker was filled up, got the fuel unloaded as there was a leakage. However, they let 4,000 litres of diesel remain in the tanker and allowed Bhagirathsinh and Rajpalsinh to sell the diesel in black market in Morbi for Rs 1.5 lakh. They gave a share of money to Patel and Valand. Similarly, Dangar and Chudasama were allowed twice to sell 18,000 litres of diesel worth Rs 14.4 lakh in Morbi and villages of Jamnagar. The scam was unearthed as Pandya had suspicion of it and he was investigating about it. On November 19, Pandya asked Dangar to show his license, but he had license of Chudasama’s father which further raised the suspicion. Dangar and Chudasama were taken to security office and questioned where they admitted that they had sold the diesel after Bhagirathsinh and Rajpalsinh told them how such a theft was possible and Patel and Valand too, agreed after they were promised their shares.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/six-booked-for-siphoning-of-diesel-worth-rs-17-6-lakh-from-tankers/articleshow/87836723.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Stop one-sided police action against BJP, VHP & Bajrang Dal: Fadnavis||Amravati: The violence on November 12 and 13 was a conspiracy to create unrest in the state and the police are taking one-sided action against BJP, VHP and Bajrang Dal activists, said leader of opposition in the state legislative assembly Devendra Fadnavis here on Sunday. Fadnavis took a dig at Amravati guardian minister Yashomati Thakur saying, “Why doesn’t she (Thakur) speak on November 12 violence?” He also dared MVA leaders to ban Raza Academy, whose morcha on November 12 against purported atrocities in Tripura led to the violence in Amravati. Reacting to the charge, Thakur said in Mumbai that legal action is being initiated against the organization. “Fadnavis is a responsible leader and he shouldn’t indulge in vote-bank politics to vitiate the atmosphere. People of Amravati supported the government’s efforts to ensure normalcy is restored at the earliest. This shows that people want peace,” said Thakur. Violent incidents were reported from Amravati, Nanded, Malegaon, Washim and Yavatmal districts. Following this, 4-day curfew was imposed in Amravati and internet services were shut on November 13. Addressing media after visiting the city, Fadnavis demanded that “one-sided” police action against BJP, VHP and Bajrang Dal activists ignoring the November 12 incidents should be stopped. “If police continue to target only Hindu outfits and activists, BJP would resort to jail bharo. If they want to arrest and re-arrest only our activists, we too are ready to court arrest,” he said. “Fake social media posts about Tripura violence were created, following which the police in that state had issued clarification. Yet on November 8, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted. Aap chronology samajhiye. Don’t always blame the central government for everything,” he said. “Raza Academy is not a BJP offshoot. If Maha Vikas Aghadi leaders are saying so, I dare them to ban the organization,” said the former CM. Terming Fadnavis’s charge of one-sided action as baseless, Thakur said the state government has taken neutral stand. “Cases have been registered against all those who organized protests. All those who tried to instigate communal tension will not be spared,” she said. Fadnavis also visited violence-hit Masanganj, Hanumanagar localities and also met injured at hospital. “Why the state government is silent on November 12 incidents? What is its role behind this silence? Does it want to polarize votes?” he asked, adding “We are ready to cooperate with the state machinery in establishing peace. It should also cooperate with us.” Stating that the November 12 violence was unfortunate, Fadnavis said the morchas taken out on that day were based on misinformation and it was a pre- and well-planned and deliberate attempt to create unrest. “The planners should be identified, their motive should be established. It was a conspiracy hatched to destabilize the state,” he said. Fadnavis wanted to know whether permission was given for Raza Academy rally on November 12. “If it (the permission) was given, for how many people? What inquiries were made before giving the permission? That morcha targeted shops of a particular community. The November 13 incidents were a reaction to it. BJP has every right to oppose lawlessness,” he said. “We are not involved in violence, yet our leaders and activists are being targeted and offences are being registered against them at different police stations,” he said. Thakur refuted Fadnavis’s claim and reiterated that no permission was given to Raza Academy rally in Amravati and there was definitely intelligence failure. “I will be raising the issue in the upcoming cabinet meeting and will seek an inquiry into the lapses and appropriate action will be taken,” she said. The process of taking action against the culprits is on. The cyber cell is also investigating those who tried to instigate citizens, said the minister. Fadnavis claimed the state government, its officers, ministers and guardian ministers have deleted November 12 violence completely from their reference, and took into account only November 13 events. “She (Thakur) hasn’t uttered a single word on the incidents on the first day. Does she want to polarize voters? Why this softness for them?” he asked. To this, Thakur said everyone knows which party benefits from polarisation and communal tension. “As far as action is concerned, the government will take strict action against the instigators of violence,” she said. “People will not fall prey to the propaganda. What happened on November 12 and 13 is a black chapter in the history of Amravati. BJP should not politicize the unfortunate developments.” BJP, VBA stir today The BJP has decided to stage dharnas all over the state on Monday and submit memoranda to collectors over November 12-13 violence, while the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi will be agitating to demand 5% reservation for Muslim community. In view of both the parties’ statewide agitation, Amravati police commissioner has banned assembly of 5 or more persons in the city from 9am to 6pm on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/stop-one-sided-police-action-against-bjp-vhp-bajrang-dal-fadnavis/articleshow/87837321.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Nagpur||Pothole repair works too giving bumpy rides||Nagpur: The BJP ruled Nagpur Municipal Corporation spends huge amounts on road repairs and maintenance, but there seems to be little or no accountability. Reason — There are bumps where potholes were repaired. TOI visited many places and found atrocious workmanship. Poor repairs are resulting in holes being overfilled, creating large bumps that drivers swerve left or right to avoid. “The stretches, which were earlier dotted with potholes, have now became more dangerous for motorists,” was the general opinion of motorists. The NMC had almost spend Rs7.5 crore for patchworks. Apart from its hotmix department, the civic body has also pressed two private machineries — Jet Patcher and Insta Patcher machines to repair potholes. For this, the NMC has paid both the firms around Rs2 crore each. NMC is also claiming to have filled over 8,000 potholes across the city this year. Potholes should be filled by following scientific method. However, neither the engineers from NMC’s hotmix (or public works department) nor the private agencies follow the proper method,” alleged vigilant citizen Rohit Desphande. He further blamed the shoddy potholes repair works due to unscientific method being applied to carry out the repair works. “As NMC is carrying out repairs in unscientific way, either the road surface becomes uneven or the work fails to withstand, which is leading to frequent mishaps,” he said. Once the NMC repairs potholes, they should subject it to a more thorough rolling to flatten the surface, he pointed out. “We see this problem all the time, in all parts of the city. Drivers will often swerve to avoid these bumps and that can be very dangerous,” said Mahesh Thaore another motorist. At several places, the repair work failed to withstand due to poor quality of works and they include Katol road stretch, stretch between Japanese Garden Square and Katol road, Zingabai Takli road (in front of Rashtrasant Tukdoji Maharaj Apartment). Automobile mechanics too pointed that uneven roads (with potholes) increases wear and tear of vehicles. According to Deshpande, patchwork roads give a shabby look to a city. Citing an example, he said, “Imagine a person wearing a torn shirt full of patch work. It doesn’t look good. Same is with the roads of the city, smooth and levelled roads give a beautiful look to the entire city.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pothole-repair-works-too-giving-bumpy-rides/articleshow/87837326.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

She stated that her husband was entitled to premature release according to the 2018 GO as the government had taken a policy decision to release prisoners based on their good conduct in connection with the birth centenary of former chief minister M G Ramachandran. However, the state submitted that Moorthy was found guilty of a major offence under Section 302 IPC and under sections of Explosives Substances Act, which is a central Act. The GO enables life convicts, who have completed ten years of actual imprisonment as of 2018, to seek premature release provided they exhibit satisfactory behaviour and are not convicted and sentenced for offence punishable under central Acts.The state further submitted that the petitioner’s husband was twice imposed punishment of forfeiture of prison privilege of interview for three months for possessing cellphone inside the prison illegally. The judges observed that they don’t find any infirmity or illegality in the decision taken by the state government for not considering the release of the petitioner’s husband. The judges took note of the state government’s submission that the prison authorities have initiated the process of constituting an advisory board to consider the case of life convicts who have completed 14 years of sentence as of 2018. Due to Covid-19 pandemic situation, the cases could not be taken up for consideration by the advisory board. The judges asked the authorities to expedite the said process and communicate the decision to the petitioner as well as the life convict at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/premature-release-not-a-matter-of-right-for-convicts-court/articleshow/87837322.cms||Kaushik Kannan

She filed the present petition last year as her representation to rescind their premature release was not considered by authorities. Her counsel submitted that the conduct of the duo after their premature release has caused fear and apprehension in the minds of the petitioner and her family members.The additional public prosecutor submitted that the director general of prisons after taking into account the subsequent conduct of the duo had sent communications to the home secretary for rescinding their premature release. However, the communications were not considered so far. A division bench of Justices S Vaidyanathan and G Jayachandran expressed unhappiness over the inaction on the part of the home secretary despite the lapse of over six months. Hence, the judges directed the home secretary to pass appropriate orders on or before November 23, failing which he shall appear before the court on November 24.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-act-on-dgps-advice-to-nix-convicts-early-release/articleshow/87837318.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Kochi||Kerala: Centre adds NH-66 widening to Bharatmala Pariyojana||KOCHI: Giving a push to the widening of the national highway 66 along Kodungallur-Edappally stretch into a six-lane road, the Union government has given its final approval for including the project in the Bharatmala Pariyojana. The outlay of the project sanctioned by the Centre is Rs 3,465 crore. The project will help ease the traffic to and fro Kochi. The state government and revenue department have been speeding up the preliminary works. Of the total Rs 3,465 crore earmarked for the project, Rs 1,100 crore will be used for land acquisition. “It was decided to include the project in Bharatmala Pariyojana. So, we have been carrying out the preliminary works,” an official associated with the project said. The state government has already allotted Rs 1,777 crore for land acquisition for NH widening along Kuttippuram-Kodungallur stretch. The fund was for acquiring around 205 hectares for the widening of 63.5km stretch of the national highway from Kadikkad in Chavakkad taluk to Methala in Kodungallur taluk. The disbursement of compensation to the land owners along the stretch had started in July 2021. According to officials with the revenue department, the acquisition process for NH widening from Kuttippuram to Kodungallur can be completed soon. The total amount for giving compensation to the land owners along Edappally-Kuttippuram stretch has been pegged at Rs 5,400 crore. “We are expediting the land acquisition process along Edappally-Moothakunnam stretch. We have disbursed compensation to the land owners who have produced the required documents. Moreover, we conducted adalats to speed up the land acquisition and disbursement of compensation,” Ernakulam district collector Jafar Malik said. Though the land acquisition process for widening the road was started in 2009, there had not been much progress since recently. The government expedited the land acquisition process after 2018. The notification for acquiring land was issued in the same year. The acquisition process is being completed as per the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. This helps the land owners get comparatively better benefits while surrendering their holdings. The minimum width required for making the highway a six-lane road is 45m. Now the existing road along the stretch has a width of around 10m. The government had acquired the land required for widening the road to 30m more than three decades ago. But then, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) couldn’t carry out the widening works. Later, it was decided to widen the road into 45m so as to make it a six-lane highway. A total of 41.05 hectares has to be acquired for widening the stretch to 45m. As per the survey conducted by NHAI, around 325 residential buildings and 150 commercial buildings will have to be razed for the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/centre-adds-nh-66-widening-to-bharatmala-pariyojana/articleshow/87836703.cms||---

The board has decided to direct the KSEB to disconnect the power supply to the slaughterhouse after a week. Earlier, the PCB had asked the local body to close down the slaughterhouse which functions without following hygiene norms. But, the local body couldn’t act on it effectively so far. “We sent a notice asking the corporation secretary to shift the animals from the slaughterhouse on Friday. The corporation which owns the abattoir should shift the animals within seven days,” an official with the PCB said. “It is for ensuring that the corporation authorities get adequate time to shift the animals that we gave prior notice. Otherwise, it will be difficult for them to maintain the animals in the absence of electricity in the slaughterhouse,” the official said. At the same time, the corporation authorities haven’t put in place alternative arrangements. “The abattoir at Kaloor is the only authorized facility in Kochi. Once the slaughterhouse is closed, it will lead to unauthorized culling of animals. So, the corporation should make alternative arrangements,” said M G Aristotle, councillor. The corporation authorities said they are planning to arrange a temporary culling facility in the GCDA market at Kaloor. Still, they haven’t taken any steps to shift the slaughterhouse to the GCDA market so far. The slaughterhouse has been functioning without an effluent treatment plant for the past several years. Blood from the slaughterhouse is being drained out to Thevara-Perandoor Canal. Moreover, the animals are being culled in an unscientific manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pcb-asks-corp-to-shift-animals-from-abattoir-at-kaloor/articleshow/87836707.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

The decision was announced by BJP president J P Nadda ahead of the assembly polls in five states, including Uttar Pradesh. Tawde was promoted to the post of national general secretary from his previous position of national secretary to fill the vacancy created by Bhupendra Yadav’s appointment as Union minister. General secretaries report directly to the party president. “This opportunity will help me become more active in national politics. I will work towards taking the government schemes to the gr-assroots. By being in the national team, I will also ensure that issues of Maharashtra are taken up more effectively,” said Tawde, believed to be a political rival of former CM Devendra Fadnavis. Tawde said that his elevation was a perfect example of how political leaders can get an opportunity if they exercise restraint and patience. “When I was cabinet minister, I was handling departments that eight ministers are handling in the MVA government. But, when I was denied a ticket, I continued to work for the party and kept patience and my potential was noticed and rewarded.” Tawde began his political career as a student leader in Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad and went on to serve as the all-India general secretary. Later, he became an MLC and was also leader of the opposition in 2011-14. Tawde was elected MLA from Borivli assembly constituency in 2014. From 2014 to 2019, he was education minister in the Fadnavis government. But in June 2019, Tawde was dropped from the cabinet and later denied a ticket for the assembly polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-denied-a-ticket-in-2019-polls-tawde-now-bjp-general-secy/articleshow/87837928.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Cong MLC poll ticket to RSS man? Cadres upset||Nagpur: The drama over Congress’s Nagpur MLC candidate (local bodies) got an unexpected twist on Sunday as the party is reportedly mulling to field a sitting BJP corporator. The discussions, which happened in Mumbai in the presence of senior party leaders, has not only shocked Congress cadres in Nagpur but also gave way to resentment. BJP corporator Dr Ravindra Bhoyar, a homeopath by qualification, seems to have emerged as as a possible consensus candidate for the Congress, say sources. Tuesday is the last day for filing nomination and Congress will declare its list on Monday. Though, for the last one month, former minister of state and Congress’s rural chief Rajendra Mulak was being portrayed as the frontrunner for the ticket, the faction-ridden party, in Nagpur, could not reach a consensus. So has Bhoyar officially trumped Mulak for the coveted MLC ticket? Unofficially, yes. A party leader from Nagpur said, “Unlike other parties, where only two factions are present, we have four — (Nitin) Raut and (Vilas) Muttemwar in city, (Sunil) Kedar and Rajendra (Mulak) in rural. Since voters in MLC polls are from both city and rural, getting a consensus is not always easy. While these factions will eventually come together in the end, the delay creates friction and ill-will among cadres.” Officially, it’s a wait-and-watch policy. Devanand Pawar, general secretary of Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) said, “We will release the list tomorrow, after it is okayed by the high command in Delhi. Till then, all names are only speculation by media.” Whether Bhoyar’s name lands up in the Congress list or not, it has already created a bit of unrest among cadres. Some members, who had gathered at city Congress office at Devadia Bhavan for a meeting on Sunday night, were unhappy that an outsider is being brought in to fight the polls. One such cadre, whose relative is a Congress corporator, said, “The candidate is a known RSS sympathizer, probably a full-fledged member too. On what basis can an RSS man be asked to be candidate of a Gandhian party?” Another question that comes to everyone’s mind is what does Bhoyar bring to the table? Sources in the Congress say he has “promised” some breakaway corporators to the party-fold. BJP leaders, however, shoo away such statements. Arvind Gajbhiye, BJP’s rural president, said, “We have done out maths. Combining rural and urban votes, we are leading by 66 as of Sunday. Bhoyar’s exit will impact only one vote, and that’s his own. Regardless, with a healthy lead, we have nothing worry about.” Some in the Congress fear that Bhoyar maybe a Trojan horse. “What if he refuses at the last moment? Or quits two or three months down the line?” said a Congress worker, who attended the Sunday meet at city party office. Another party member said, “Senior party leaders must have already taken all this into account. Of course, anything can happen, after all even Ajit Pawar took oath with Devendra Fadnavis but then came back to his uncle.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cong-mlc-poll-ticket-to-rss-man-cadres-upset/articleshow/87837332.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Through the campaign, named Three and a Half Hour Energy Conservation Revolution, the students try to limit the consumption of electricity at their houses for three hours daily, between 6pm and 9.30pm, for a month through judicious use. The readings of the domestic electricity meter are recorded daily and submitted to Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB), which supports the campaign. Students, whose houses consumed the least amount of electricity at the end of the monthlong campaign, will be given gifts. Various awareness activities like poster design are held as part of the campaign. The campaign, which started on November 1, is held in all the 51 schools in the district that have SPC units. In each unit there are 88 cadets and they are divided into eight groups with 11 members each. Each group has a leader, who will be coordinating the campaign. All the cadets have been given a training session by KSEB officials regarding the tips for energy conservation and how to create awareness among the public before the launch of campaign. Anoob John, the community police officer of the SPC unit at Ramamangalam High School and one the main coordinators of the campaign, said that the electricity bill of the houses of all the cadets in October have been collected by the officials and the next bill too will be collected to see the difference in power consumption. The leaders will make a chart of the power consumption readings of the houses of all members every day at 6pm and 9.30 pm. Based on these readings and the bills KSEB officials will choose the winner. “KSEB suggests switching off the refrigerator during this time as the cooling will be maintained normally for three-and-a-half hours. The aim is to minimize the consumption during peak hours. Cadets will also make elders aware about tips,” John said. The campaign is held under the supervision of DSP narcotic cell Zacharia Mathew, who is the district nodal officer of SPC in Ernakulam Rural. M A Tenson, chief engineer, distribution central, KSEB, Ernakulam is monitoring the campaign.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/spc-launches-power-saving-drive/articleshow/87836712.cms||---
---||Madurai||MK pic flip-flop on Amma unavagam board||Madurai: A new name board that appeared outside the “Amma unavagam” at Sundarajapuram in Madurai city on Saturday kicked up a controversy as it had the photograph of late chief minister M Karunanidhi also on one side besides that of J Jayalalithaa on whose name the canteens were set up across the state by the former AIADMK government led by her. However, after it raised many hackles, the board disappeared on Sunday.Established under the food and civil supplies department to supply food at subsidized cost, Amma unavagams are operated by local bodies and run by self-help groups. Though all such canteens had photograph of Jayalalithaa on the name board, many of them were removed in the last two months. It was in this backdrop that the new nameboard surfaced and disappeared. “It really was a good move, showing that this government had a forward-looking approach to things,’’ said S Murali of Sundarajapuram. However, in a statement, former AIADMK minister R B Udhayakumar said the importance given to the photograph on the name board should also be given to the functioning of these canteens. In a letter to district collector Dr S Aneesh Sekhar, he said 700 Amma unavagams fed over 12 lakh people a day in the state. In Madurai, there were twelve of them operated by SHGs. But now, many of these canteens were finding it hard to function, like the one in front of Thirumangalam government hospital, due to lack of funds. Suppliers of rice, dal and vegetables to this canteen had not been paid for the past six months.The DMK government was trying to claim credit for this extraordinary scheme and conceal the photograph of Jayalalithaa by placing a photograph of Karunanidhi close to it. Meanwhile, Madurai corporation sources said that the sign board had been put up by some party functionaries and that they had removed it as it was not approved by the civic authorities. BJP leader Pon Radhakrishnan told reporters that affixing Karunanidhi’s photograph on the Amma unnavagam name board was condemnable and corporation officials owed an explanation for it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/mk-pic-flip-flop-on-amma-unavagam-board/articleshow/87837335.cms||---

The city has ranked 15th among 45 cities with population of over 10 lakh in the country. The rankings declared by the ministry of housing and urban affairs a day ago showed the city is at fourth position among 10 cities in the state. Navi Mumbai, which secured second rank in the nation, was first in the state, followed by Kalyan-Dombivali at number two, and Aurangabad at three. However, when it comes to scoring, city managed to get only 334.08 of total 1,000 marks. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI, “Ranking of 15th among 45 cities is satisfactory. The government organized this challenge for the first time and we are hopeful of improving the position next year. This challenge was about handling of sewage system and safety of workers engaged in this work. We have engaged one sewage suction machine in each of the 10 zones for clearing choked sewage lines. We have life insurance for all sanitary workers working on permanent basis. We also give them reimbursement for hospitalization. They get all safety kits for work.” Under Swachh Survekshan-2021 rankings announced a day ago, city was ranked 23rd among 48 cities. Last year, the city was at 18th position. Sanitary workers’ leader Kishor Samundre said, “Around 400 of total 8,000 sanitary workers are engaged in cleaning of sewage network. There are many areas in the city where machines cannot enter. Therefore, NMC has continued manual cleaning of lines and chambers, which is harmful for sanitary workers. They are not given basic facilities like hand gloves, gumboots, masks etc. For last 12 years, workers engaged on daily wages were not even given uniforms. They are also forced to enter sewage chambers, which is an inhuman activity.” NMC is yet to engage robots or any other mechanized system for clearing choked sewage lines and chambers. Even manholes are open in many areas and sewage water can be seen overflowing on roads or in public places in some localities. Among 85 cities falling in 3-10 lakh population, Amravati stood at 7th place with 604.60 marks followed by Chandrapur on 12th position with 501.48 marks and Akola on 42nd place with minus 8.81 marks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-fares-better-in-safaimitra-suraksha-challenge-ranked-15th-among-45-cities/articleshow/87837343.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Madurai||Fishing fest celebrated in hamlet near Melur||Madurai: The fishing festival in Ottakovilpatti was celebrated by villagers by fishing in their local tank using a rod and line instead of nets on Saturday.The festival is celebrated annually in the hamlet near Melur the day after Karthigai deepam. Kamaraj from the village says that people of this village fast for one month before the Karthigai deepam and the fishing festival is held as a breaking fast event.Fish is reared in the local tank in Ottakovilpatti in the first three months of the year and people are not allowed to fish in it till the Karthigai festival is over. As the tank held copious amount of water this year, it was swarming with a variety of native fish species including catla, ayirai, tilapia, mural, and Indian carps.If the tank is dry and there are no fish, the villagers usually cook meat in their homes during the festival. This year hundreds came geared with fishing rods to the tank early in the morning. A small ritual was performed and then they threw their lines which had a hook with a worm dangling at the end into the water.“We spent the whole of Friday looking for worms which we kept bottled as bait for the fish and that proved to be fruitful, because the early catchers got not less than two kilograms each of fish,” said K Saravanan a student, who had come to visit his relatives. Some of them also returned empty handed.Usually fishing festivals involve using nets and baskets to catch fish, but this one prohibits the use of nets. A good catch, is expected to signal a good year for agriculture in the village, according to the locals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/fishing-fest-celebrated-in-hamlet-near-melur/articleshow/87837341.cms||---

The chief minister and his party should not forget that they had organized serial protests in connection with the Mullaperiyar dam.

The station is faced with a shortage of woman constables, and with male cops constituting the bulk of the station’s sanctioned force of 40, many an aggrieved woman is thinking twice about visiting the station to file complaints.At a time when cases of abduction, domestic violence and murder of women are on the rise in the district, the shortage of women staff at the police station only serves to highlight the apathetic attitude of the authorities concerned towards addressing problems affecting women. The station, tasked with investigating all cases concerning the safety of women, is struggling to cope with the workload in view of the shortage of staff. Consequently, investigation into many a case has been dogged by delay, leading to a corresponding delay in disposal of cases. The state home department appears not too concerned to fill the vacancies at the station.Vijayapura superintendent of police Anand Kumar has reportedly drawn the attention of his superiors to the vacancies at the women’s police station, and submitted a proposal to the government, pointing to the need to fill up the vacancies. That there are more male constables at the women’s police station is a concern that the top cop has intimated the government of. Senior citizen and Vijayapura-based activist Gopal Naik said, “There are certain delicate issues that many women are reluctant to speak about with male constables. Consequently, they just decide against visiting the station.”Pointing out that Vijayapura was home to more than 1,000 villages, Naik said, “Most cases of atrocities against women are reported in the rural boroughs. Most villages do not have enough toilets, and open defecation is distressingly common as a result. In many cases, women were abducted or harassed when they stepped outside to relieve themselves. Shashikala Jolle, the minister for woman and child welfare, is also the Vijayapura district in-charge minister, but she has not been taking measures to ease the plight of the women here.”Fellow activist Ninganagouda Patil pointed to the imminent need to construct more public lavatories in Vijayapura. “That the actual number of toilets constructed in the villages is considerably less than the number reported by the panchayat development officers. Most gram panchayat offices have turned into dens of corruption,” Patil rued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/dharwad-police-station-faces-shortage-of-female-constables/articleshow/87836040.cms||---

---||Nagpur||AAP: Where did FDCM spend bamboo board’s Rs1.68cr grant?||Nagpur: The Aam Admi Party (AAP) has demanded a probe into the Rs 1.68 crore released to the Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM) by the Maharashtra Bamboo Development Board (MBDB) under the 100% grant scheme of the National Bamboo Mission (NBM). Information received under RTI by social worker Manoj Wahane revealed that the FDCM failed to utilize Rs 2.43 crore released under NBM in the last two years by the MBDB. Of the Rs 2.43 crore, FDCM surrendered Rs 50 lakh while using Rs 25 lakh for plantation but it has failed to say what happened to the remaining Rs 1.68 crore? In 2018-19, MBDB entrusted FDCM with the task to set up bamboo processing units by providing a 100% grant amounting to Rs 2.43 crore. The amount was released for setting up a hi-tech bamboo nursery in one hectare, high-density bamboo plantations in 50 hectares, one processing unit for value addition of bamboo, another unit for bamboo waste utilization which is generated in primary processing units, a unit for handicrafts/cottage industry, one unit for furniture making, a bamboo depot and godown and a demonstration plot to exhibit best practices to farmers. However, out of the above projects, FDCM surrendered Rs 50 lakh to the MBDB meant to set up a hi-tech nursery without implementing the project. In a reply to the RTI application, the corporation claimed that it has set up high-density bamboo plantation in an area of 50 hectares and also issued a fund utilization certificate of Rs 25 lakh. However, Wahane says either the location of the plantation has been provided or the survival rate. As regards the remaining projects, no works have been carried out in the last three years. “As work on the remaining projects is being carried out, detailed information cannot be given,” replied FDCM PIO Darshika Rakhunde. MBDB’s Rs 1.68 crore is lying with the FDCM since the last 3 years towards pending projects. In spite of the inordinate delay, the MBDB, which is the nodal agency under the NBM, has not sought any explanation from FDCM nor has it taken any steps to ensure that the above projects are completed. “Inaction by FDCM and MBDB has deprived over 250 rural youths of productive employment in the proposed bamboo units. We have demanded a departmental inquiry and action against the concerned officials till the responsibility for the delay in project implementation is fixed,” said Pratap Goswami, bamboo expert and Sanghatan Mantri of AAP. Even as FDCM failed to give details of Rs 1.68 crore, in reply to a Rajya Sabha question raised by Narayan Rane, the data of bamboo units set up by the MBDB under NBM has been provided. However, AAP alleged the figures provided in the Rajya Sabha reply do not match the actual units on the ground.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/aap-where-did-fdcm-spend-bamboo-boards-rs1-68cr-grant/articleshow/87837372.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Cops arrested Ranchhod Sheikh, who lives in Surendranagar, as he had supplied the gun to one Bhaylu Jalu. Jalu was arrested on August 4 for possessing the gun and he had told police that he had bought the weapon from Sheikh. Police said that between 2017 and 2019, Sheikh was booked in 26 cases of Arms Act registered in Surendranagar alone. “He does not use the weapon himself but makes the gun and sells it to whoever is interested in buying. In just two years, he had supplied guns to around 26 people,” said inspector V K Gadhvi of crime branch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/maker-of-country-made-guns-nabbed/articleshow/87836763.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: 47,000 throng Eden Gardens after two-year Covid break||KOLKATA: The emerald green Eden Gardens turf bathed in the glow of floodlights yet again even as a 47,000-strong crowd cheered for Team India on a nippy Sunday evening. Every shot played by Indian batters was greeted with the familiar deafening scream and every opposition wicket that fell prompted a roar that reverberated through the Maidan. Return of international cricket to Kolkata was marked by scenes that had been missed over the last two years. And fans lapped up the action as the Men in Blue locked horns with New Zealand at the hallowed stadium for the 3rd T20I match. More than the result, it was the excitement that mattered on Sunday and it was not found wanting. And with Indian openers Rohit Sharma and Ishan Kishan tearing apart the Kiwi bowling, Eden went into ruptures. With wickets tumbling subsequently, the initial euphoria disappeared, much like the masks — that had been made mandatory for entry — which were discarded by many. Businessman Priyesh Gupta, a resident of Entally, decided to watch the match, even though the third T20 was a dead rubber, because he did not want to break the streak of watching every India match at Eden Gardens. “The way second wave struck and governments had imposed restrictions I felt it will take a couple of more years for sports to return to the stadiums. But I am delighted it has happened so soon,” said Kunal Shaw, a Howrah resident. For the likes of Mohammad Arshad, 27, Vicky Sau, 23, and Sunny Singh, 27, return of cricket to Eden Gardens meant good business. “I sell at least 15 to 20 team jerseys apart from other merchandise whenever India plays at Eden. This means an income of close to Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 in a day,” said Arshad. Sunny Singh paints Indian Tricolour on the faces and arms of team fans near Howrah Sporting Club opposite Eden Gardens. After a gap of almost two years, the usual scenes of young fans surrounding him before the match were back on the greens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/47000-throng-eden-gardens-after-two-year-covid-break/articleshow/87836768.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The continuous drizzle from Saturday evening till late wee hours yielded heavy rainfall in many centres, making it the wettest spell in November after 26.8mm recorded on November 17. As forecast by IMD earlier, Dabolim recorded heavy rainfall of 85.2mm, Mapusa 74.5mm, Mormugao 73mm, Old Goa 66mm and other centres on a moderate scale. On Sunday, the overall surplus during the post-monsoon season soared to 119%. A total of 189mm is normal at this stage but it has now touched 414.3mm with the weekend precipitation. The rain has caused much harm to agricultural activities and sowing and planting of crops have been delayed due to waterlogging and other problems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/imd-records-one-of-states-wettest-nov-spells-of-64-7mm/articleshow/87836787.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Stop one-sided police action on BJP, VHP, Bajrang Dal in Maharashtra: Devendra Fadnavis||AMRAVATI: The violence on November 12 and 13 was a conspiracy to create unrest in the state and the police are taking one-sided action against BJP, VHP and Bajrang Dal activists, said leader of opposition in the state legislative assembly Devendra Fadnavis here on Sunday. Fadnavis took a dig at Amravati guardian minister Yashomati Thakur saying, “Why doesn’t she (Thakur) speak on November 12 violence?” He also dared the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) leaders to ban Raza Academy, whose morcha on November 12 against purported atrocities in Tripura led to the violence in Amravati. Reacting to the charge, Thakur, who is in Mumbai, said that legal action is being initiated against the organisation. Terming Fadnavis’s charge of “one-sided action” baseless, she said the MVA government has taken a neutral stand. “Cases have been registered against all those who organised protests. All those who tried to instigate communal tension will not be spared,” Thakur said. Violent incidents were reported from Amravati, Nanded, Malegaon, Washim and Yavatmal districts. Following this, a four-day curfew was imposed in Amravati and internet services were shut on November 13. In view of BJP and Vanchit Bahujan Aaghadi (VBA) announcing a statewide agitation on Monday, the police chief has barred assembly of five or more persons in Amravati from 9am to 6pm. While BJP is staging a dharna and submitting memoranda to collectors across the state, the VBA is protesting to demand 5% reservation for Muslims. Addressing the media, Fadnavis demanded that “one-sided” police action against BJP, VHP and Bajrang Dal activists ignoring the November 12 incidents should be stopped. “If police continue to target only Hindu outfits and activists, BJP would resort to jail bharo. If they want to arrest and re-arrest only our activists, we too are ready to court arrest.” “Fake social media posts about Tripura violence were created, following which the police in that state had issued clarification. Yet on November 8, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted. Aap chronology samajhiye. Don’t always blame the central government for everything,” said the former CM.  “Raza Academy is not a BJP offshoot. If MVA leaders are saying so, I dare them to ban the organisation,” Fadnavis added. “Why is the state government silent on the November 12 incidents? What is its role behind this silence? Does it want to polarize votes?” he asked. “We are ready to cooperate with the state machinery in establishing peace. It should also cooperate with us.” Stating that the November 12 violence was unfortunate, Fadnavis said the morchas were based on misinformation and it was a pre- and well-planned and deliberate attempt to create unrest. “The planners should be identified, their motive should be established. It was a conspiracy hatched to destabilize the state,” he said. Fadnavis wanted to know whether permission was given for the Raza Academy rally. “...That morcha targeted shops of a particular community. The November 13 incidents were a reaction to it. BJP has every right to oppose lawlessness.” Thakur refuted Fadnavis’s claim and reiterated that no permission was given to the Raza Academy rally in Amravati and there was definitely intelligence failure. “I will raise the issue in the cabinet meeting and will seek an inquiry into the lapses and appropriate action will be taken,” she said. The process of taking action against the culprits is on. The cyber cell is also investigating those who tried to instigate citizens, she said.  “Fadnavis is a responsible leader and he shouldn’t indulge in vote bank politics to vitiate the atmosphere. People of Amravati supported the government’s efforts to ensure normalcy is restored at the earliest. This shows that people want peace.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/stop-one-sided-police-action-on-bjp-vhp-bajrang-dal-in-maharashtra-fadnavis/articleshow/87837950.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Kolkata||Schools prepare for ISC exam on Monday||Kolkata: School campuses in the city were busy with last minute preparations for the ISC examinations that are due to start from Monday. A few thousand boys and girls of class XII will write the first semester of ISC, organised by the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations across schools. This year the exam has been split into two. Since distanced sitting is the focus this year, most schools have arranged for examinees to write the test in auditoria, gymnasia and big libraries to space them out. Many have decided that since candidates would be spaced out, they might pull down the mask once in a while to breathe easy. The new format exam will be based on MCQ and candidates will have to write on the question cum answer booklet, to be submitted for evaluation. External examiners will visit the school for evaluation immediately after the exam is over, evaluate scripts and upload the marks as per the new system that is being followed this year. The exam is for one-and-a half hour duration and would be taken from 2 pm to 3:30 pm. At St Xavier’s Collegiate School, 225 candidates would be writing the test at the gymnasium of the school. A shamiana has been constructed outside so that extra movement around the gymnasium is minimised. Sunlight masking has also been done to keep the gymnasium as comfortable as possible for the candidates. Additional fans have also been provided. “The academic co-ordinators were on campus to check if any last minute fine tuning was required. We are all set for the big day now, especially because there was no physical board exam last time,” said Father Thamacin Arulappan. At Don Bosco Park Circus, three big halls are being used for the exam that will be written by 178 candidates. “Since candidates will come with parents in private vehicles given the Covid situation, we have made arrangements for them to wait at the auditorium,” said principal Father Bikash Mondal. The police has been requested to make parking arrangements. At The Heritage School, where 208 candidates will write ISC, barring two to three candidates, the rest will come in school buses, said principal Seema Sapru. The school has made arrangements not only in the auditorium, but also in the library, to space them out. “Wearing the mask continuously in an exam situation is very difficult. So we will allow them to bring it down once in a while,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/schools-prepare-for-isc-exam-on-monday/articleshow/87836774.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Nagpur||Two weeks post festive rush, Covid well under control in Vidarbha||Nagpur: Until few weeks ago, experts and even members of Covid-19 task force were expecting a little surge in the number of new cases of the Covid-19 infection especially in the post-Diwali weeks as the festive season saw a major mix-up of population, travels, and shopping rush. But, the figures in Vidarbha are showing a different reality. Cases are coming at a normal average even after the festive rush. In fact, the fortnight post Diwali has seen 10 less new cases than the fortnight before Diwali. Thus it can be concluded that the festive rush and mix-up has not led to an alarming surge of the Covid-19 infection. “We have cleared a major litmus test. Not only in the terms of numbers, the new cases coming post Diwali are also providing relief as most patients don’t have more than mild symptoms,” said Dr Nitin Shinde, infectious disease specialist. “This could be considered as a big achievement of the region’s population. Many of us have natural antibodies and others have vaccine protection. Now, we must move forward. Government should consider starting the children’s vaccine and reopen schools for all to bring life to normalcy,” said Dr Shinde. According to epidemiologist Anand Thatte, the in-built immunity, natural infection worked for rural population while vaccines are doing magic in urban areas. “Vaccines have given protection from serious illness. It’s not that the virus is not there. But, the spread has got restricted a lot thanks to vaccination. We should cover more and more population with both the doses of vaccine,” he said. A senior member of the district Covid task force said that the administration has been informed about the post-festive conditions and advised to go ahead with the re-opening plans. “We are keeping a close eye on the fresh surge in cases especially in some European nations. Unless we get any new mutation, we are largely safe in India,” said the doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/two-weeks-post-festive-rush-covid-well-under-control-in-vidarbha/articleshow/87837378.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The decision to resume in-person education for students of Classes 1 to 5 was announced by state education minister Jitu Vaghani in Surat on Monday. Schools had been demanding the resumption of in-person education for Classes 1 to 5. They wholeheartedly welcomed the decision. But some associations of parents are skeptical about the move, terming it “hasty, risky and taken under pressure from school managements.” Vaghani said that the standard operating procedure (SOP) being implemented for Classes 6 to 12 will apply for Classes 1 to 5. “In-person attendance will not be compulsory. Education will be imparted both offline and online,” the minister said. “School managements will now be required to coordinate with the education department in getting consent letters from parents.” Commenting on the concerns raised by several quarters over the safety of children, the minister said: “Let us pray that Covid-19 cases continue to fall.” He added: “The sight of small children in schools will boost the morale of everyone in the fight against the pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-wall-breaks-classes-1-5-kids-with-pals-at-last/articleshow/87836798.cms||---

The woman was detained in connection to a theft. But soon after her detention, she started having severe labour pain after which the cops rushed her to SSG Hospital. “As soon as she was brought to us, we rushed her to the labour room. She has delivered a baby girl weighing 2.9kg. We all were happy as the delivery was successful without any complications,” said in-charge sister Bhanuben Gheewala, adding that currently both the mother and the newborn are doing well. Gheewala, one of the senior-most nurses at the hospital, said it is the first such incident in her career. “I believe this must be the first such delivery in our maternity ward,” she said. A female caretaker is taking care of the mother and the newborn while the baby has undergone a complete health check-up. “Somebody’s status in the eyes of the law or police department is of no concern to us when it comes to health. We provide treatment to every patient without any discrimination,” said Dr Ranjan Aiyer, medical superintendent of SSG Hospital. “Our priority is to ensure that the health of the mother and the newborn remains good,” he said, adding that the mother-daughter duo is being provided treatment as per norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/woman-accused-of-theft-delivers-baby-at-ssg-hospital/articleshow/87836344.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Second jab overdue for more than 40 lakh in West Bengal||KOLKATA: In Bengal, the vaccination drive now poses its biggest challenge with 4.8 lakh people and 35.4 lakh people failing to take their second Covaxin and Covishield doses, respectively, on time . Among them are a significantly high 2.9 lakh Covaxin recipients who have delayed their second dose by nearly two-and-a-half months and 11.6 lakh Covishield recipients who have delayed their second dose by 126 days or over four months. The situation is no better in Kolkata, too. According to a detailed data compiled by the state health department on November 15, Kolkata, by far, has the highest number of people who have not taken their second doses on time. In Kolkata, like Bengal, 35,425 people have not taken their Covaxin even 70 days after their first dose and 14.1 lakh people have not taken their Covishield dose even after 126 days of taking their first dose. TOI has already reported that nearly 42.4 lakh people in Bengal have not taken their second doses on time. Among them 24 lakh people are due for their second doses, and 18 lakhs are overdue for their second doses. For Covaxin, the due date for the second dose is 29 to 42 days after the first dose, anything later is overdue. For Covishield the due date for second dose is either 85 to 98 days or 99 to 112 days from the first dose. If someone doesn’t take a second Covishield dose even 113 days after the first dose they are considered overdue. According to the detailed district-wise data released by the state health department, the bulk of people who haven’t taken their second dose on time are from Kolkata and North 24 Parganas. While in Kolkata there are four lakh such people, in North 24 Parganas it is 3.8 lakh. Hooghly is third with 2.3 lakh people skipping their second doses. Districts in which over two lakh people have skipped their second doses are Alipurduar, Murshidabad and South 24 Parganas. In a bid to close this gap, for the past weeks, second dose vaccination has outstripped the first dose in Bengal. According to Co-Win dashboard, on November 9, 3.5 lakh people were given their second dose compared to 3.3 lakh first dose. This trend continued barring November 14 and 15. From Tuesday, the second dose vaccination has been more than first doses. On Saturday, 2.8 lakh second doses were given against 2.4 lakh first doses. In Kolkata, the second dose vaccination has picked up a faster pace. Since November 8, for every first dose recipients turning up in Kolkata vaccination centres, on an average six to seven times more people are coming for their second doses. In Bengal, among the 8.7 crore people who have received their vaccine, 6.1 crore have received the first dose and 2.5 crore both their doses. Bengal has a vaccine eligible population of over seven crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/second-jab-overdue-for-more-than-40l-in-state/articleshow/87836782.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Police said the primary reason for the extreme step was nagging domestic dispute. At around 12pm, Sonal Devmurari (40), a resident of Haridham Society in Chalala town, sprinkled kerosene on herself and her two daughters Hitali (14) and Kushi (3) and then ignited fire.

---||Kolhapur||Maharashtra: Unseasonal rain damages grapes on 60,000 acre in Sangli district||KOLHAPUR: Heavy rainfall accompanied by thunder and lightning has been predicted in the Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara districts on Monday as well. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD) Mumbai, the intensity of the rains will ease out partially from Tuesday, and Thursday onwards, dry weather conditions are likely. On Sunday, some parts of the region received moderate to heavy rains. In Kolhapur city, the weather conditions were completely cloudy throughout the day. The farmers are worried as they are facing losses due to untimely rains. According to the primary estimates, the grapes in the flowering stage on 60,000 acres have been damaged in Sangli district due to untimely rainfall. Kiran Pawar, a grape farmer from Turchi village of Sangli district said, “I'm having sleepless nights since last one week as I’m worried about the untimely rains. This weather is bad for the grapes which are in the flowering stage. The showers and cloudy weather cause pest infestation leading to Downy disease. The expenses on the pesticides have increased as we have to spray them every other day and that too during wee hours to ensure that the infestation is at bay. If we survive this phase, only then we will be able to get some income at the end of the season.” Kiran Pawar wakes up in the wee hours daily to spray pesticide in his grape farm to avoid wastage of costly pesticides due to rains and gusty winds. He is among thousands of grape farmers who have adopted the practice of early morning spraying. Not just grapes, the rain has caused problems in sugar cane harvesting too. The showers are making it difficult for cutters to cut the cane speedily. The clogged fields are making it difficult for the vehicles to reach the fields. On other hand, the process of making jaggery too has been halted. The dry agriculture stubble used as fuel is wet due to rains. The stubble from sugar cane fields is burnt and used for boiling the sugar cane juice to turn it into jaggery. Sugar cane farmers have been caught from both sides, as they are unable to get the cane cut on time and send to mills for crushing and on the other hand they cannot make jaggery out of it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/unseasonal-rain-damages-grapes-on-60000-acre-in-sangli-district/articleshow/87835566.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Reintroducing ‘tekra-talav’ system for water recharge||AHMEDABAD: The city before rapid development of western parts had ‘tekra-talav’ system where the difference between the planes helped store water and create natural water bodies. However, over the decades, the development blocked many of these pathways to run the monsoon water off and recharge the lakes. Moreover, the increasing population also increased dependence on groundwater. A study titled ‘Fluid urbanism: Synthesising urban commons with water’ by a Cept University student Riya Soni was recently published in journal Urban Scripts.  In the paper, she mentioned that the Mahakali lake at AUDA Garden in Bodakdev was fed by various other lakes during the monsoon through an intricate drainage pattern between Shilaj, Thaltej, and Vastrapur lakes. But over the years, the connection was lost. As a measure to connect the system again, she proposes a network between Mahakali and Vastrapur lakes and revive it as a socio-cultural space to re-connect it with citizens. ‘We bring together small parcels of land (public spaces) and connect them with a system of bioswales. These smaller spaces are designed as holding points of water during high-intensity rainfall. The system is further detailed by integrating bio-retention basins, wetland gardens, and sedimentation tanks. Hence a cohesive system consisting of bioswales, bio-retention basins, rain gardens, wetlands, etc., have been put together as an elaborate effort to reconnect the water through the site,’ mentioned the study. The space around it can be developed for recreational activities, argued the researcher, adding that if successful, it can be similarly used in other spaces to reduce flooding of roads during monsoons and naturally establishing the connection between water bodies to improve both surface and ground water availability. The city has several active and defunct water bodies including lakes in Thaltej, Vejalpur, Ambli, Shilaj, Bopal, Makarba, etc. in addition to Kankaria and Chandola. Each of these lakes had catchment areas extending several hundred meters and a natural flow system even as the city's elevation is overall not very unequal. The Narmada connection has reduced the dependence on groundwater to some extent, said experts, but still the water table is very important for sustaining a large population of the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/reintroducing-tekra-talav-system-for-water-recharge/articleshow/87836803.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Busy day for cops as crowd breaks rules||Kolkata: Sunday got off to a busy start for Kolkata Police in the Maidan area as they managed a 47,000-strong crowd at the Eden Gardens for the first time since 2019. The morning started with multiple arrests as Kolkata Police detective department and Maidan police arrested 11 persons for selling tickets ‘in black’ and seized around 60 such tickets. Police said the arrests saw mainly club membership ticket and those worth Rs 650 exchanging hands. Tickets were sold for anything between Rs 400 and Rs 1,500. “Going by the ticket demand, this game seems to be the city’s most significant attempt to return to normalcy,” said an officer. A sterner test awaited the cops in the evening. “We allowed entry from 4.30pm, almost three hours before the first ball was bowled. Spectators came dressed for the occasion. But many forgot their masks. Nearly 30%-35% of them tried to enter the stadium without masks. We initially distributed some masks but as time wore on, it became impossible to keep track of the ones who took their masks off after crossing the gate,” said an officer. Cops on duty at Auckland Road-Strand Road sector fined at least seven persons for not wearing masks. “What is the point of donning Indian colours on our faces if we cover it up with masks?” asked one among the crowd. Traffic cops said over 50 spectators were fined for not wearing helmets. “They kept saying that it was no use wearing a helmet as there was no provision of taking them inside,” recalled another ACP on duty near the Mohun Bagan grounds. The cops set up nine watch towers “We tried to ensure that there was no crowding during entry. But once inside we could do little,” claimed an officer from Maidan police. Over 2,000 cops were deployed. Sleuths of Anti-Rowdy Squad too were posted, said Lalbazar sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/busy-day-for-cops-as-crowd-breaks-rules/articleshow/87836793.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Aurangabad||AMC owes Rs 22cr as water dues to irrigation dept||Aurangabad: The civic body, which has started taking action against citizens for not paying taxes, itself has outstanding dues of Rs 22 crore towards the water it sources from the Jayakwadi dam. Authorities of the Godavari Marathwada Irrigation Development Corporation (GMIDC) said the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) is one of the major defaulters. “The civic body of Aurangabad was expected to make yearly payment towards water it draws towards public water supply scheme for the residents of Aurangabad. It has not paid its dues in time in the recent past citing certain issues,” a senior GMIDC official said. Renewing its appeal for payment, GMIDC authorities said timely payment by the AMC will be beneficial for all stakeholders involved including citizens. The local civic body draws 135 MLD water from Jayakwadi major irrigation project, which is then treated and purified at different facilities before getting supplied to residents of Aurangabad. When contacted, Kiran Dhande, in-charge of water supply department of AMC, said financial issues faced by the local civic body has resulted in delayed payment of water dues towards the GMIDC. “The issues related to payment aggravated only during recent past and the situation became more complex since Covid outbreak as the revenue went declined,” he said. While AMC has started disconnecting water supply of major defaulters in case of non-payment of dues, a section of citizens said the local civic body should lead by example. “Despite getting funding from the Centre and state government, the AMC always finds itself in tight financial position. It should tap latent revenue options in the tourism capital to boost its income,” Balasaheb Kale, a senior citizen, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/amc-owes-rs-22cr-as-water-dues-to-irrigation-dept/articleshow/87835473.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Nagpur||Third dose of Covid-19 vaccine should be a reality soon, say experts||NAGPUR: While vaccination is going on in good numbers and new initiatives are being introduced to cover the unvaccinated population, doctors are now asking for a policy regarding the third or booster dose. According to doctors, the nationwide policy for the third dose of Covid-19 vaccine must be introduced at the earliest. “Doctors were the first to take Covid-19 vaccine and most of them are from the batch that has taken both doses at 28-day interval. Later, it was scientifically proved that the increase in the gap of two doses brings better immunity. So, in a way, they have missed this ‘improved’ protection. As a result, doctors should be given priority and third dose should be allowed to them,” said Dr Ravi Wankhedkar, senior IMA functionary. Many private hospitals in city have piled up the Covid-19 vaccine doses and they could be utilized in case the government brings a policy for third dose, said Vidarbha Hospital Association president Dr Ashok Arbat. “Proper policy should be introduced for the third dose which will benefit the people at large,” he said. According to infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde, it’s the best time to launch the third dose as we are heading towards New Year.  “In 2021, it was the same period when the virus started mutating. By February, we got a major Delta hit and second wave began. Instead of waiting for February 2022, we should proactively launch the third dose policy and allow it to people officially,” he said. Director of a leading private hospital in Nagpur informed that many people have unofficially taken the third dose but many are waiting for the government to make it official.  “Third dose is officially approved in USA. Our government takes decision only when the situation turns into emergency. Third dose can be optional, paid, and private hospitals can be allowed to register interested people,” said the doctor. State Covid Task force has discussed about the third dose policy in its recent meeting, said a senior member.  “Experts have given their opinion. Even a mix-match can work in case of third dose. Nationwide Policy is likely to be announced by the end of November,” the member said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/third-dose-should-be-a-reality-soon-say-experts/articleshow/87837421.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Only vehicles coming from the Indiranagar side are permitted to use the underpass to go towards Govind Nagar side. Motorists coming from Govind Nagar headed towards Indiranagar are not permitted to use the underpass. Such motorists have to drive 100 m towards the Mumbai Naka side and take a U-turn beneath the flyover to go to the other side of the underpass. While this rule is followed when the police are deployed at the underpass, the violation begins after 9 pm daily when the police leave. Mahesh Nirkhe, a resident of the Indiranagar area, said, “Vehicles using the underpass from the wrong side take other motorists by surprise and they have to apply screeching brakes. The risk of getting hit by the vehicle behind it also increases. At times, there are also arguments between motorists in the underpass.” Many motorists said this happens all throughout the night until the police arrive the next morning at around 9 am. The problem is faced mainly when the rush of vehicles is more between 9 pm to around 10.30 pm. Motorists are not willing to take a detour of a couple of 100 m around the underpass to go to the other side of the highway. Police inspector Sajan Sonawane of the city traffic branch said, “The one-way rule is in place for close to five years now. Motorists should understand that breaking the no-entry rule from Govind Nagar side can lead to accidents. The police are on their toes all through the day till 9 pm daily to ensure there is no violation. Motorists should be responsible in their own interest and the interest of other people on the road.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/risk-of-accidents-at-indiranagar-underpass-in-nashik-city/articleshow/87835571.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Currently, around 150 tonne of grapes are being harvested per day on an average and sent to north India. In addition, the grapes are also being exported to Russia from here. Usually, the regular grape harvest season in Nashik district begins from the second-half of January. It peaks in February and March, and ends by April. On the contrary, early grape harvest begins in November and ends by December-end in Satana taluka of the district. The early grape harvest takes place on 6,000 acre of the total 2 lakh acre under grape plantation in the district. “Early grape season has begun in Satana and nearby areas and will continue till December-end by the time the regular grape harvest season begins,” Manik Patil, a senior office-bearer of Maharashtra Rajya Draksha Bagayatdar Sangh, said. Farmers have said that they are fetching good rates this season in both export as well as the domestic market. Khanderao Shevale, a grape farmer who planted grapes on 70 acre land in Satana, said farmers had to incur heavy losses in the last grape season due to unseasonal rainfall. “But there has been no damage to the vineyards this time and the early grape harvest season is on in full swing. We are also getting good rates in both international and domestic markets. We are getting Rs 100 per kg price in the domestic market this year, against the price of between Rs 70 and Rs 80 per kg last year,” he said. “We are also exporting grapes to Russia where we are getting Rs 110 per kg this year, against Rs 80 per kg last year,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/early-grape-harvest-begins-in-nashiks-satana-taluka/articleshow/87835575.cms||Tushar Pawar

State convener of Goencho Avaaz Viriato Fernandes said, “Perhaps Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has forgotten that it was his government that enforced a law in Delhi in 2015 making taxi meters compulsory as part of the ‘City Taxi Scheme’. And today Kejriwal audaciously promises to reject taxi meters in Goa? I urge our Goa taxi drivers to not fall for Kejriwal’s ‘jumlas’ and instead to judge his actions.” Stating that Kejriwal, forgetting his anti-corruption stance, recently welcomed Dayanand Narvekar into the party, Fernandes, “This is a prime example of Kejriwal’s desperation to make inroads in Goa, after failing to open an account in the prior elections. From the stance he has taken in Delhi, taxi operators in Goa should be made to understand the fact that their cause will suffer tremendously if they blindly pay heed to Kejriwal’s words.” Kejriwal announced that, if AAP is elected in Goa, a taxi corporation would be formed to deal with all issues pertaining to the sector and that they would challenge the government decision on taxi meters. It appears that AAP has not understood Goa given their catalogue of mistakes. Kejriwal’s tactic of using caste politics to manipulate the electorate is yet another faux pas on the part of AAP, co-convener Swapnesh Sherlekar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/taxi-operators-cautioned-about-aap-promises/articleshow/87836841.cms||---

On September 9, 2020, the PCCF office here had sent a revised proposal to offer Rs25 lakh relief to the kin of forest officials and employees who lay down their lives on duty and Rs3 lakh in case of permanent disability. Earlier, the proposal was sent twice to the state government — once on May 29, 2017, and later on May 16, 2019. With the killing of forest guard Swati Dhumne by a tiger in the core area of Tadoba on Sunday, the foresters and officials have once again raised the issue. The scheme is in place in the police department for those who are injured or killed while fighting Naxalites. Under the scheme, Rs25 lakh is kept as a fixed deposit and the family of the kin gets monthly interest thereof. The amount cannot be withdrawn for 10 years. However, on September 18, 2012, the state had allowed to withdraw the money in exceptional cases. As per the GR issued on September 22, 2008, the Maharashtra government announced its forest policy. One of the clauses (3.3.13) states, “If any forest officer/employee dies or attains disability while attending the call of the duty, such employees and officials will be paid compensation package as per the existing policy in the police department.” Considering the state forest policy and existing scheme prevailing in the police department the forest department sent a proposal to the government but it is gathering dust. Ajay Patil, central president of Maharashtra State Forest Guards and Promoted Foresters Sanghatana said, “Such forest employees should be declared as Van Shahids. They move into forests for official work without any safety measures and are true protectors of the huge environmental assets. The state should immediately approve the proposal.” As per the home ministry GR issued on June 1, 2011, there is a provision that if any officer/employee dies while on duty, the last salary he was drawing should be paid next to his kin till the date the deceased employee was to retire. Besides, the payment of salary should be enhanced as per the time-bound promotions the deceased employee/officer was supposed to get during his service period. Over the last few years, there is a spurt in attacks on foresters by poachers, encroachers, timber smugglers. Besides, foresters are also vulnerable to wild animal attacks during patrolling and extinguishing forest fires. According to an application filed by Kishor Rithe, member, Nature Conservation Society Amravati (NCSA), in the Supreme Court, from 1987 to 2020, in Maharashtra alone, 656 foresters have been attacked causing the death of 19 of them. The situation in other states like Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan is even worse.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-sitting-over-forest-dept-proposal-on-martyrs/articleshow/87837394.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The Bypass bound flank of the flyover was shut on last Thursday for the KMDA to conduct the load test. Officials said that four sand fill trucks weighing a total of about 124 tonne was uploaded on the flank to conduct the static load test and that as per preliminary findings during tests, the flank has managed to take on the load without much deviation. Repair and post repair assessment of Ultadanga flyover now concludes with completion of the load test. The EM Bypass bound flank of the flyover had developed a number of cracks that was temporarily repaired in 2019 but full-fledged repair and strengthening work of the flank was left which was taken up this year by KMDA. Among other bridges on EM Bypass, the authorities have already taken up soil test work before starting off with major repair and retrofitting work of Baghajatin rail over bridge. Meanwhile, KMDA has engaged an agency which is conducting surveys and preparing a detail project report for thorough repairs of the 17km long EM Bypass stretch from Hudco crossing to Garia. “The agency is doing an assessment of the entire Bypass stretch as to how the condition of the road stretch which gets riddled with craters and potholes specially during monsoons could be corrected and improved,” said a KMDA official. Officials said that as per instructions laid down by the authorities, the top bitumen layer of the EM Bypass stretch needs routine maintenance for every five years but the surface was last laid on2013-14 and is already overdue for two to three years. The condition of the EM Bypass stretch deteriorates after heavy rains after monsoons each year as the KMDA authorities conduct patch work on the damaged spots as temporary measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/suman-bypass-flank-of-ultadanga-flyover-reopens-21-11-21/articleshow/87836817.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: A peek into history at old governor-general’s house||KOLKATA: In a letter to Queen Victoria dated November 22, 1861, Lord Canning mentioned how the mortal remains of his wife had to be laid to rest in a “portion of the garden at Barrackpore” since the cemeteries in Kolkata were “odious in many ways”. “It is a beautiful spot, looking upon that reach of the grand river which she was so fond of drawing, shaded from the glare of the sun by high trees and amongst the bright shrubs and flowers in which she had so much pleasure,” Lord Canning wrote. A day ahead of the 160th death anniversary of Lady Canning, West Bengal Heritage Commission (WBHC) members including Biswajit Matilal, Umapada Chatterjee and Basudeb Malik visited the site at the old governor-general’s residence on the banks of the Hooghly to commemorate World Heritage Week. The original marble monument, which began to deteriorate under extreme weather conditions, was shifted long ago to Kolkata’s St John’s Church. In Barrackpore now stands a replica with the inscription: ‘I will ransom them from the power of the grave/I will redeem them from death’. At a distance is a towering sculpture of Lord Canning. While installing a plaque in the presence of author Amit Chaudhuri, entrepreneur Harsh Neotia and members of Purono Kolkatar Golpo on Sunday, WBHC chairperson Shuvaprasanna said, “Standing in front of the Minto fountain, the honeymoon lodge or the arterial roots of the grand banyan tree takes us back in time.” In his company were French consul general Didier Talpain, Japanese consulate general Nakamura Yutaka, British Deputy High Commission’s deputy head of mission Yemi Odanye, project head of Serampore Danish Initiative Bente Wolff and Bangladesh’s deputy high commissioner Toufique Hasan. Heritage enthusiasts take a walk of the campus that has landscaped gardens, park land and an English-styled bridge over a stream The inscription of the plaque mentions that the construction of this house had begun in 1801 during the period of Lord Wellesley. Designed by Captain Thomas Anbury, it was built as a weekend retreat of the governor generals and viceroys. The structure has elements of Renaissance architecture and is surrounded by landscaped gardens, park land and an English-styled bridge over a stream. In 1947, it came under the purview of the Police Training College, renamed as Swami Vivekananda State Police Academy. It was partially converted into a police hospital. The WBHC declared it a heritage site in 2013. Visitors at the CBI theatre of World War II The view of the Ganga on the horizon, the Alpana road inside the Swami Vivekananda State Police Academy with designs painted by the cops, the imposing structure of the old governor general's house, the steps leading up to the first floor, the light filtering into the verandah through the blinds and the chandeliers hanging from the ceiling - most of the visitors felt that almost everything complemented each other to create a lasting impact. Lady Canning's grave. In the background is the sculpture of Lord Canning Actor-turned-MLA June Maliah was intrigued to see a photo of Netaji meeting Hitler at CBI theatre of World War II. "I always knew about the historical importance of Barrackpore because of the Sepoy Mutiny but it had never occurred to me that such an oasis existed in its heart. I had never seen this photograph of Netaji before. The entire museum was very interesting. With my love for animals, I also enjoyed the dog squad show." The plaque was installed on Sunday  A colony of houses, author Amit Chaudhuri pointed out, needs to be preserved. “I’m glad that WBHC is conserving and not being hostile to a colonial legacy. There need to be careful rules and people assigned the job of restoration need to be careful about additions and changes because the originals have extraordinary features which can’t be replaced. The interior is as seductive, if not more, than actually the exterior,” he said. The collection of arms on display at the museumA museum in the building’s basement has a collection of arms, including a boat cannon, the Smith Wesson revolver, the Webley Scott revolver, a single-barrel gun and a double-barrel gun. These weapons were kept unattended in a store at the Swami Vivekananda State Police Academy. They were seized by the British Police during the first half of the 20th century from revolutionaries of Bengal and sent to the academy for safe custody post-independence. Unfortunately, documents are not available as yet regarding the history of their seizures. Describing the display as “interesting”, heritage architect Partha Ranjan Das said, “It has some improvised single shot guns, too. However, it’s best to keep the walls and flooring of a restored heritage building as close to the original as possible.” The construction of this house had begun in 1801 during the period of Lord Wellesley Art connoisseur Nandita Pal Chaudhuri praised the efforts of Kolkata CP Soumen Mitra, who was then the ADG of police (training) and in charge of Lat Bagan Police Training School and played a major role in the restoration. “This trip showed me how one man’s initiative can have such a largescale impact on safeguarding our heritage. I wish there were more such people,” she said. Heritage enthusiast Sandip Nowlakha added, “This work has given inspiration to come up with the idea of the inaugural Barrackpore Heritage Festival on January 30.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/a-peek-into-history-at-old-governor-generals-house/articleshow/87836810.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||India||After Covid, Andhra floods stall Isro’s sat launch missions this year||NEW DELHI: After the Covid pandemic cast a shadow over Isro’s mission launches for over a year, now it is the flood situation in Andhra Pradesh that is stalling satellite launches at the SHAR launch centre in Sriharikota, a barrier island located in Nellore district of the state. Isro sends key satellite and rocket components from its centres in Kerala and Karnataka to Sriharikota by road for assembling and launch. As many arterial roads in Nellore have to be closed due to the floods, Isro is not able to finalise its launches. Isro chairman K Sivan told TOI, “We have been working on three launches, including the small satellite launch vehicle (mini-PSLV) launch, before the year ends. But due to heavy rain and floods in Andhra, we have to reassess the situation... We can decide on the three launches only when the flood situation improves.” Sivan, whose one-year service extension as Isro chief is set to be over on January 15 next year, said that 2022 will be a crucial year for the space agency as it will witness the launches of Aditya L1 (Sun) mission, the first unmanned mission of Gaganyaan and several key satellite missions. According to an earlier schedule, Isro was supposed to launch its mainstay rocket PSLV, carrying two earth observation satellites, EOS-04 and EOS-06, as the main payload. The third mission was the first development flight of SSLV, carrying another earth observation satellite EOS-02. However, the Andhra flood situation forced Isro to do a rethink. The floods due to overflowing Somasila reservoir damaged the Chennai-Kolkata National Highway-16 in Nellore and the highway had to be shut down following a huge breach of road at Padugupadu and also near Nellore town. Over a hundred people are feared dead and properties and crops worth crores of rupees have got damaged till now. Isro had successfully launched a commercial PSLV mission in February but its launch of GSLV-F10 rocket carrying EOS-03 satellite on August 12 failed as the third cryogenic stage of the launch vehicle did not start. In comparison to India’s one successful mission so far, China has already conducted 40 launch missions in 2021, setting a new national record. The successful Kuaizhou-1A lift-off on October 27 took China to 40 orbital launches, surpassing the 39 launches conducted by the country in 2018 and 2020. The US has so far launched 39 times this year, including rocket lab launches from New Zealand, according to spacenews.com.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-covid-andhra-floods-stall-isros-sat-launch-missions-this-year/articleshow/87838312.cms||Surendra Singh

According to the notification, school authorities are not bound to follow staggered timing for classes IX-XI and X-XII. All classes may commence from 10.50 am and will continue till 4.30 pm. While classes X-XII may attend offline classes thrice a week, classes IX and XI twice a week, the notification said. It also said that classes X and XII may attend classes on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and classes IX and XI may come to school for offline classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Staggered timings were also stretching duration of classes to over six hours that was turning out to be inconvenient for teachers and students who have to travel a long distance. After a long closure, the state gave a final nod to reopen classes from IX-XII from November 16. The school education department on October 29 had issued a notice for staggered timings for entry and exit for different classes to avoid crowds. Classes IX and XI were entering campus at 9.30 am and their class hours were from 10 am to 3.30 pm. Classes X and XII had to enter at 10.30 am and attended classes from 11 am to 4.30 pm. A notice has been issued on Sunday, saying classes IX to XII may be held from 10.50 am to 4.30 pm from Monday to Friday in all districts except in Darjeeling and Kalimpong where classes may commence from 9.30 am and continue till 3 pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/timing-tweak-for-govt-aided-schools/articleshow/87836838.cms||---
---||Kolkata||IIT-Madras nod to new Tallah bridge design||Kolkata: IIT-Madras has given its seal of approval to the design and scheme of girder-launching over railway tracks for the new Tallah bridge. Eastern Railway (ER) can now submit the application for inspection and permission from the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS). The CRS, under the ministry of civil aviation, gives the safety nod for any new railway project across the country. The third-party scrutiny by an institute of repute, like the IIT, vouching for flawlessness of the launching scheme is a prerequisite for the railways to apply for the mandatory CRS’ approval. “With the vetting and certificate from IIT-Madras, ER can now send its application to the CRS, thus pave the way for the crucial girder-launching across the railway tracks,” a PWD official told TOI. IIT-Madras sent the documents on Saturday, and ER officials, in turn, came to work even on a holiday, so that they could receive and scan them to make preparations for the application to CRS, which is likely to be completed in the next four days. Or so ER had promised PWD minister Moloy Ghatak and state officials when the former convened a meeting on the progress of work last Thursday. The new Tallah bridge is actually a road overbridge (ROB) under the ER’s ambit. A 240-metre section of the 750m structure will stand over the Tallah railway tracks. The old Tallah bridge, which was a crucial link between Calcutta and the northern fringes, was pulled down in April, this year because it had worn out so much that engineers feared the structure could collapse any moment. “IIT-Bombay professors have scanned the girder-launching scheme, after going through every technical specification,” said an official of the state public works department (PWD), which is implementing the Rs 350crore bridge reconstruction project. In May, contractors L&T started the reconstruction work. “We are trying to rebuild the bridge as soon as possible and alleviate commuters’ plight,” a PWD engineer said. TOI reported on 8 November about a nagging hurdle being cleared for the project with ER shifting its quarters that fell on the alignment of the ramp which will link the new bridge with Cossipore Road. Construction work for the ramp, as part of the new ROB, has been stuck for the last few months because of these 38 railway quarters. ER officials said 12 families have been relocated in various railway quarters in the Chitpur area. PWD expects to start work for the ramp next month as the railway quarters are now out of the way.

---||Kochi||Kerala: Tree stump forces KSEB to close Cheruthoni shutter||IDUKKI: KSEB dam safety wing officials on Saturday night suddenly closed the shutter of Cheruthoni dam of Idukki reservoir as a fallen tree stump was seen moving towards the dam. According to KSEB officials, the sudden closing of the shutter was to avoid a major disaster to the shutter operation of the reservoir which is at almost full storage. At around 9:30pm on Saturday, police personnel noticed a dried-up log in water moving towards the shutter, which was opened up to 80cm, and alerted KSEB dam safety officials. “The only option was to immediately close the dam shutter to avoid the log getting stuck in the shutter. We then immediately sought permission from higher officials and the district collector and immediately closed the shutter at around 10pm,” said a KSEB dam safety official. “It was a big teak tree with huge roots. Had it got stuck in the dam shutter, we would have to reduce the water level till 2,373ft and it would be a huge loss to KSEB and the state. But the timely intervention helped avoid the loss. Earlier, in Peringalkuthu reservoir, when trees blocked the shutter the reservoir had to be dried to remove them. But in Idukki reservoir, it is not possible. After closing the shutter, the tree was cleared on Sunday with the help of fire and rescue force personnel. Every year, KSEB officials remove five to six trees from the reservoir area. But when the shutter is open, presence of large trees poses great risk,” he added. According to officials, the rule curve was changed in Idukki reservoir on Saturday night onwards and they decided not to open the shutters of the dam. Presently, the water level in the reservoir is at blue-alert level, said the official. The water level on Sunday at 7pm was 2,400.12ft. As per the rule curve fixed by CWC, the orange-alert level is 2,401ft, red-alert level is 2,402ft and upper-rule level is 2,403ft. Meanwhile, the water level in the Mullaperiyar dam was at 141.05ft at 4pm on Sunday. Tamil Nadu closed all the spillway shutters, except V3 which was reduced to 10cm at 9.30am.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tree-stump-forces-kseb-to-close-cheruthoni-shutter/articleshow/87836858.cms||Sandeep Thomas

In November alone, a senior AMC health official told TOI, some 940 complaints have been received from across the city, the maximum 320 from the western part such as Chandkheda-Motera, Navragpura, Paldi, Vadaj, Stadium and Vasna areas. “These areas are a bit congested, have old construction and leaking pipelines and high density of vegetation, which together become conducive for mosquito breeding,” said the official. The next troubled spot is the municipal south zone with 162 requests for fogging and anti-vector activities. Giving a snapshot of the total complaints handled by the AMC, the official said that this year the AMC’s health department has received roughly 12,000 requests from the west zone alone, followed by the 5,100 requests from south zone, which mainly covers areas like Beharampura, Maninagar, Danilimda, Lambha, Isanpur, Indrapuri and Vatva. “On our routine visits to such homes, we have begun advising residents on possible spots in their houses where the mosquitoes may be breeding. We don’t impose any fines at that point,” said the official. He said the maximum violations and breeding was found in commercial complexes in western Ahmedabad and in institutions like schools and colleges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mosquito-curbs-amc-flooded-with-requests-for-fogging/articleshow/87836850.cms||---

This year due to Covid-related restrictions only the pandal outside the church will be used for the novenas as well as feast masses, Fr Dias said. This will ensure social distancing among the devotees who would be attending the novena as well as feast day services. “Face masks, sanitisation and social distancing will be maintained during the entire festivities,” said Fr Dias, adding that those attending the services from Nov 24 till Dec 3 should adhere to SOPs issued by the government. The feast of St Francis Xavier is special to devotees from across Canacona taluka as a piece of the saint’s bone lies preserved in a small glass casket at the church. The St Francis Xavier Church was elevated from a chapel and dedicated to the saint in 1968, is now all decked up for the novenas starting on Wednesday, and for the feast on December 3. The faithful from Canacona, Karwar in Karnataka and other nearby places will venerate the Spanish saint’s relic from November 24 till the feast day.“A piece of the bone of the saint’s index finger was dispatched to Canacona by the then Bishop of Goa, Rev Francisco Xavier de Piedade Rebello,” Fr Dias told TOI. The blessings of Maddi (banner) will begin on Tuesday after the morning Mass at 7.15am. The novenas will be held from November 24 to December 2 with morning Mass preceded by rosary at 7.45am and the evening Mass preceded by rosary at 4.45pm. The feast Mass will be held at 10am and will be presided over by Canacona dean, Fr Santana D'Souza who will also preach the homily. The other Masses on the feast day will be at 6am, 7.15am and 8.30am, said Fr Dias. The 8.30am mass has been specifically scheduled for devotees people from the taluka and visitors from other states only, while the other masses have been earmarked only for parishioners, Fr Dias said. Pilgrims who travel from neighbouring Karwar, Maharashtra and other outstation locations will be allowed to attend the functions by maintaining social distance. For a few months the relic remained at St Theresa of Jesus Church at Chaudi, Canacona but when the chapel was elevated to a church after a decree issued by Bishop Rebello in 1968, the relic was gifted to the Bhatpal church by the Chauri parish priest say village elders. Prior to 1968 the chapel feast was celebrated in May but later it was decided to celebrate the feast on December 3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/canacona-church-gears-up-for-sfx-feast-amid-covid-protocols/articleshow/87836944.cms||---

On Saturday, Sujan died after sustaining mysterious head injuries in a lift at Anusaya Mangal Karyalaya at Jagnade Chowk where he was part of a catering team. The police have on Sunday registered an offence against venue owner (owner of Anusaya Mangal Karyalaya), manager and labour (catering) contractor in the case. Sujan, a student of Standard X, had started working with the catering team for Rs250 a day since Diwali. On Friday, Sujan had left his Sangharsh Nagar residence near Wathoda to work with the team and had been attending back-to-back functions. “I lost my son for the Rs250,” said Sujan’s inconsolable mother Savitri. Sujan was the youngest of four siblings. The Guptas (Sahu), originally from Uttar Pradesh, had migrated to the city from Mumbai around a decade ago in search of greener pasture. At around 11am on Saturday, Sujan seemed to have got injured inside the lift while carrying some utensils. He was rushed to a private hospital, but declared dead. Sujan’s aggrieved father Dilip said the youngster, who was with Sujan, has been frequently changing his statement. “We received a call at around 1pm that my son had met with an accident,” said Dilip, who said he wanted an FIR to be registered immediately against the venue management for allowing his son to step into a lift which was dangerous. “The lift seemed to be unsafe with open sides,” he said. The sorrowful Guptas said they sense foul play. “My son had a deep injury on the skull. Police are saying that Sujan’s head may have got stuck in the lift’s grill gate. In that case, there would have been injury on both sides of the head,” said Sujan’s mother. Commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar said relevant charges have been invoked against the concerned persons and further investigations are on. Vidya Kale, owner of Anusaya Mangal Karyalaya, said the lift was meant only for goods and not for human use. “We have no clue as to how the boy may have stepped inside the lift and got injured. There is a warning board too inside the lift,” she said adding our agreement with the catering or labour contractors says not to engage any minor at work. Senior inspector Kishor Nagrale of Nandanvan police station said the lift was manually operated to take goods to-and-fro between first and fourth floor. According to sources in the energy department, electrical inspectors are supposed to check the lift as per the Bombay Lifts Act, 1939 and Bombay Lifts Rules, 1958, to ascertain whether permission was sought for operating the elevator meant for goods. “After accidents, electrical inspectors scrutinize the lift and zero down upon the root cause behind the incident. Violations are ascertained and compensation may be also awarded under the Act,” said the source. Child protection officer Mustak Pathan said a child labour officer would soon conduct inspection and submit report. “Police should file an FIR under Juvenile Justice and Child Labour Acts,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/16-year-old-working-to-support-family-dies-in-accident/articleshow/87837431.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Ludhiana||Poor STPs made city slip on Swachhta Survekshan ranking||Ludhiana: One of the major reasons for the city slipping five ranks in the Swachhta Survekshan ranking is lack of ODF++ certification. Of the 13 large municipal corporations of the state, 10 MCs have ODF++ certification except Ludhiana, Kapurthala and Batala. Due to the absence of this certification, the civic body’s 300 marks are deducted. The Ludhiana MC officials could not get the certification this year as it required fully-functional sewerage treatment plants (STPs), a condition which is likely to be met after December 2022. Cities like Amritsar, Jalandhar, Patiala, Bathinda, Hoshiarpur, SAS Nagar, Moga, Abohar, Pathankot and Phagwara have ODF++ certification.The authorities said the city has STPs, but those were defunct and if they had applied for the certification, the request would have been rejected directly. The MC has been ranked 39th of 48 cities with more than 10-lakh population in the Swachhta Survkeshan. In this category, only Amritsar (ranked 34th) competed with Ludhiana from the state.An official said, “The city’s score is not bad, considering the fact that its solid waste management is poor and most of the requirements could not be implemented. If Buddha Nullah rejuvenation project had kicked off in time, it would have improved the ranking as its STPs would have become functional. Other cities like Amritsar and even Jalandhar have functional STPs so they could get this certification.” Superintending engineer of operation and maintenance cell Rajinder Singh said, “We have started construction of STPs. At Jamalpur, an STP of 225 MLD capacity is being constructed at a fast pace. We are hopeful work will be completed in time. We can apply for ODF++ certification after December 2022.” Residents said while Indore and many other cities were declared water+ (those who use tertiary treated water) and garbage-free, Ludhiana was still struggling with garbage and STP issues.Amarjit Bhatia, a resident of Sarabha Nagar, said, “If Indore can manage to secure the first position for five consecutive years, then why cannot Ludhiana MC work hard to at least get better ranking every year.”The city was declared open defecation free (ODF) in October 2018 on the basis of availability of public toilets at remote locations. The ODF+ certification was given in February 2020 for providing smart public toilets equipped with feedback machines, sanitary napkin vending machines, soap and other required things. ODF++ certification is issued when all STPs are working. The city has five STPs, all of which are not functioning properly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/poor-stps-made-city-slip-on-swachhta-survekshan-ranking/articleshow/87836109.cms||---

Another inmate had made similar allegations about two weeks ago.Arun Aggarwal, superintendent of Ludhiana observation home, said, “During the visit of National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) team on Saturday, an inmate, who is an accused in a murder case, told them that he was sodomised by some unidentified inmates of the juvenile home from May 1 to October 3.”Following his statement, a complaint was lodged with the police, who have registered a case.Inspector Balkar Singh said, “On November 9, an inmate had sent a written complaint to the observation home superintendent, accusing fellow inmates of sodomising him for six days. On November 12, the police had booked at least 10 inmates. The NCPCR team visited the juvenile home to inquiry into the case. When it was recording statements of other inmates, the 17-year-old said he, too, was exploited for about five months.”“As the complainant does not know the accused who assaulted him, the FIR has been lodged against unidentified persons under Section 377 (sodomise) of the IPC. We are trying to identify the accused.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/17-year-old-inmate-alleges-sodomy-at-observation-home/articleshow/87836117.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Rain plays spoilsport for PWD; 20 projects stalled||Thiruvananthapuram: The incessant rains that have been lashing the district during the last one week may have taken a break, cutting down on the intensity, but they have surely left a lasting impact on various ongoing projects of the public works department (PWD) in the state capital. According to PWD authorities in the district, around 20 projects of road works, both major and minor, have been stalled indefinitely owing to the rains. The reason cited by the department authorities for this problem is the absence of a window for drying up the raw materials used in the surfacing works of the road. According to district PWD authorities the projects that are affected are the ones where surfacing works are pending. The road surfacing is carried out using a mixture of crushed rocks and bitumen. The crushed rocks need to be properly dry in order for the mixture to be strong. Or else, the bitumen bonding will be rendered weak and it will be washed away during further rains. “Though the incessant rains have stopped, we are still receiving intermittent rains and this prevents the raw materials from drying up,” said PWD executive engineer (Thiruvananthapuram division) R Jyothi. She added that only if the rains stay away for at least five continuous days, will they get enough time to dry the raw materials and restart the surfacing works. One of the major works that have been affected is the Pappanamcode - Malayinkeezhu road works. Though majority of works were completed here, the surfacing works have not been able to be completed owing to frequent rains. Another project affected is the 11th Mile MS Road work at Neyyattinkara (NABARD), 85 % of which has been completed. The deadline of the project is set to expire by November 30. If the weather remains unfavourable, the department will have to extend the contract period. Similar is the case of Attingal - Puthenpalam - Venjaramoodu 27 kilometer stretch. Works have been completed over 17 kilometers of the road. The executive engineer said that the repair works of the Shangumugham - Airport road were not affected, however, and are progressing. This is because the work being carried out there currently does not involve surfacing. It is related to construction of a 300 meter long diaphragm wall there. They have installed sheet piles covering 210 meters in this regard so far and sand is being filled into it. The department hasalso started assessing the extent of damages suffered by the roads during the recent rains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/rain-plays-spoilsport-for-pwd-20-projects-stalled/articleshow/87823429.cms||---

There are a few cameras inside the complex, but most of them are non-functional. As the juveniles are lodged here, there is an urgent need to equip it with new CCTVs.”The panel plans to take some other initiatives, too, to prevent such incidents.The District Child Welfare Committee chairperson, Gurjeet Singh Romana, said, “The inmates will be segregated now. Those till the age of 13 years will be accommodated separately from the 14 years old and above. Besides, we also plan to sensitize them. We have contacted a psychologist, who had retired recently from the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), to organize counselling sessions of the inmates. Regular counselling of the inmates will avert such incidents.” “New CCTVs will soon be installed inside the juvenile home complex as many of the cameras are non-functional. Also, to channelize the energies of these teenage inmates in the right direction, the committee plans to start skill development training with the help of Industrial Training Institutes. The inmates have been provided moral support and encouraged to contact the juvenile home staffers if they face any kind of harassment,” he added.The juvenile home now houses 85 inmates, as 10 of the accused booked in a sodomy case on November 12 have been shifted to borstal prison in Ludhiana Central Jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/complex-to-get-new-cctvs-juveniles-to-be-put-up-separately/articleshow/87836124.cms||Payal Dhawan
---||Pune||0.25% breakthrough infections in fully vaxxed people in Pune district||PUNE: Only 0.25% people taking both doses of Covid-19 vaccines contracted the infection in the district so far, reinforcing the significance of getting vaccinated against the disease and following the protocols, including wearing mask and maintaining social distance. A report from the district health office stated that around 12,031 out of 46 lakh fully vaccinated people suffered from Covid-19 in Pune district till now. According to it, at total of 7,231 people contracted the infection after getting both the doses in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits, followed by 3,217 in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) areas and 1,583 in Pune rural. The report revealed that around 15,964 people contracted the Covid-19 infection after taking the first dose of Covishield or Covaxin. The number, according to the officials, was minuscule (0.19%) because over 79.87 lakh first doses have been administered so far. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “If one contracts the infection even after vaccination, it is called breakthrough infection. For the Pune district, this number is minuscule. The vaccination, anyway, does not warrant complete protection, but it makes sure the severity of the infection tones down. Also, the festive season in the past few months have resulted in some people not following the Covid-appropriate behaviour.” Deshmukh said the residents should comply with the necessary Covid precautions to avoid further escalation of cases. Sanjay Patil, chairman, Hospital Board of India, said, “At present times, we must understand that we are not fighting with a single virus, we are rather fighting with viruses and its variants.” He said there was a possibility of the vaccination giving people a false sense of confidence, prompting many to flout Covid protocols. “One should continue to follow Covid norms like social distancing, hand hygiene and wearing a mask,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/0-25-breakthrough-infections-in-fully-vaxxed-people-in-dist/articleshow/87836882.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Mumbai||Nearly 1 in 5 road deaths in Mumbai caused by hit and run||MUMBAI: Deaths in hit-and-run cases, in which pedestrians and two-wheeler riders are mainly the victims, comprise over 30% of road accident fatalities in the country, according to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). In Mumbai, of 1,681 road accident deaths between 2017 and 2020, over 17.5% were hit-and-run deaths. This proportion for Maharashtra during the same period was much higher, at over 23%.  Experts say that the majority of road accident victims, especially of hit-and-run cases, die because of not getting immediate medical assistance. They could be saved during the golden hour if only accused drivers would not speed away.  “Hardly five percent of hit and run cases remain unsolved. In such cases, the accused are booked under the Motor Vehicles Act for not providing medical assistance to the victim, apart from IPC sections where the accused are booked for rash and negligent driving and culpable homicide not amounting to murder,” said additional director general of police (traffic) BK Upadhyay.  A research article by Nehal Kharyal from Vivekananda Institute of Professional Studies (VIPS) describes major hit and run cases and their legal consequences. “The biggest issue in these cases is a lack of direct evidence, because of which it becomes difficult for the police to investigate.”  IPS officer-turned-lawyer YP Singh said that in cases related to motor accident deaths, there is a complete lack of clarity in the legal definition of what constitutes “accidental death” and what constitutes “culpable homicide not amounting to murder”. While accidental death is a bailable offence, culpable homicide is not. “In many cases, this leads to arm-twisting by the police. Many times milder sections are applied even in serious cases. It is this lack of clarity that often leads to inflicting injustice to the victims and their families,” said Singh.  A transport official said that in general (all cases considered, and not only hit-and-run) pedestrians account for 47% of fatalities on Mumbai roads while bikers comprise 41%. Speed management and pedestrian infrastructure improvements are key to reducing deaths among such road users, he said, adding, “All pedestrian pathways should be free from encumbrances (like encroachments by hawkers).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nearly-1-in-5-road-deaths-in-mum-caused-by-hit-and-run/articleshow/87837737.cms||Somit Sen
---||Goa||Goa students win national contest, grant for shelter for Makadmares||PANAJI: Moved by the plight of the Makadmare tribals in Nirankal, Ponda, a group of architecture students decided to study their needs, and made the tiny community the focus of their project for a national competition. The students are now one of five winners of the observation and action network (OAN) fellowship organized by the national association of students of architecture (NASA) and center for the living and urban design collective. The group has won a grant of Rs 1.2 lakh, which finally holds the promise of providing the Makadmare tribals a literal roof over their heads. The students have designed a community shelter, which, as per the conditions of the NASA contest for OAN grants, now has to be constructed by June 2022. The students’ project involves constructing the shelter with the tribal community members itself. Living in around 20 thatched huts, the tribals have to reconstruct their temporary structures every year and have to survive water gushing into their homes during the monsoon. After spending long hours with Makadmare community members, the students realised that a community shelter could be the answer to the problems of these landless tribals. The team of students, who won the grants, include fifth year students of Goa College of Architecture, Mark Vas, Gyles Ferrao, and Raveena Deshpande, fourth year student from the same college Ayesha de Sousa, and one fourth year student from SPA Bhopal, Saavi Natekar. Under their mentor, architect and social worker Tallulah D’Silva, the students called their project ‘vangad — a work in progress’. The name vangad refers to the participatory process through which the project was designed, said Vas. “The structure will serve as a full-scale live precedent to guide them in rebuilding their homes in a more cost effective and sustainable manner. It will be built by the community under the guidance of the vangad team — making the construction process an act of skill-building in the tribe. The community centre can be utilized to host sanitation drives, community classrooms and other initiatives,” he said. Twelve teams were shortlisted in all for NASA’s OAN grant from across the country. The Goa students began work on their project in August. “The Makadmare community has been in the news for a while, and so we decided to work on a project for them. We spent a large part of two days with the community and spoke to each household to understand their requirements. From then on we kept going back to them while designing the project to get their inputs,” said Deshpande. The students now plan to use a third of the grant money to construct the community centre, while the rest of the money will be kept aside for the tribe members for the annual reconstruction of their houses. “The community does not have a roof, and we learnt that the only place for the women to spend time in community activities is a temple. So the project hopes to provide a multipurpose shelter for the community, which can last for seven to nine years. We plan to start work as soon as we get the grants,” said Deshpande.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-students-win-natl-contest-grant-for-shelter-for-makadmares/articleshow/87837447.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

Currently, only four out of 23 Metro stations have bus connectivity. Nagpur Metro doesn’t provide any information about the service it on its website or mobile app. TOI visited the Orange and Aqua lines of Metro and found that the number of feeder vehicles is low. It has not restarted its airport shuttle service too. The MahaMetro’s common mobility card also can’t be used to pay for feeder vehicles as its officials had claimed two years back. Recently, Nagpur Metro received a central government award for best multi-modal integration (MMI) in the country. Feeder services are the most important component of MMI. MahaMetro had submitted its entry in the Best Multimodal Integration format. “Maha Metro included multi modal integration planning and implementation from the beginning of the project (planning stage) for fast, safe, efficient accessibility and dispersal of commuters to and from Metro stations. This led to Nagpur getting the acknowledgement,” said MahaMetro’s executive director (administratin) Anilkumar Kokate. Prajakta Meshram, a domestic help from Khapri, said she used the Metro a few times as it’s a cheap mode of transport. “However, as there is no feeder service, I had to walk long distances. I have stopped using the Metro. Authorities to improve the feeder service so that people like me are able to use it. Every station should be connected by city buses,” she pointed out. Hospital employee Vinay Waghmare said, “The Metro is good but there are no vehicles at the station to take you further. What is the point in building the Metro if common people can’t use it?” MahaMetro also claimed that 12 e-rickshaws of ETO Motors are operational on Orange and Aqua Lines at the time of submission of entry to UMI (excluding 4 E-Rickshaws of Twarit Mobility Pvt Ltd). TOI did not spot any. 34 e-rickshaws bought by ETO Motors is being registered with the RTO for use at Airport South Metro station, according to MahaMetro. The Maha card, announced in August 2019, which could be used for feeder service as well as an ATM card is not yet functional. Kokate said the internal security audit of SBI is in progress, “resulting in the delay of the card”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/improve-feeder-service-at-metro-stations-say-commuters/articleshow/87837442.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Speaking to reporters after inaugurating the anti-K-Rail people’s campaign at Mananchira in Kozhikode on Sunday, he alleged that chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan was aiming to conduct large-scale corruption with the project. He added that BJP will strongly oppose the project and there was no certainty whether the much-hyped project will be realized. “There is no clarity on who is the consultant for the project, from where the loans would be raised and how the loans will be repaid. Already the central government has made its stand clear,” he added. Surendran added that the Kerala government was moving ahead with the project though no authoritative study was carried out on the project. “The communist government in West Bengal ended following protests which erupted after the government went ahead with a large-scale land acquisition for industrial projects of corporates like Tatas,” he added. Surendran added that while many projects in state were caught up in red tape, the file of K-Rail project was moving at great speed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/k-rail-facing-many-hurdles-surendran/articleshow/87836886.cms||---

Mumbai tops the list now with 66.06% of its beneficiaries getting both the doses. The report stated that Mumbai had achieved 100% first jab inoculation, while Pune covered 95% of the target population with the first dose. The report stated that only 13 districts in the state had recorded 80% or more first dose vaccination. Of these 13 districts, only four — Mumbai, Pune, Bhandara and Sindhudurg — have administered the first dose to 90% of their target population. According to the report, only three districts — Mumbai, Pune and Sindhudurg — have over 50% second dose vaccination coverage. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “The vaccination rate in the district has been outstanding, courtesy the health departments of Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic bodies, and Pune rural offering proper infrastructure and instructions on inoculation.” He said the next target for the Pune district was to achieve 100% first dose vaccination by December 15 and covering 60% of the target population with the second shot by November-end. Sanjay Patil, chairman, Hospital Board of India, told TOI, “The private hospitals, too, have played a key role in vaccination in the district. Ample doses were available with private hospitals during the initial phase, when the vaccines were offered for free, as well as later, when it was paid. This eased the burden on the government-run sites.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-district-2nd-in-state-in-second-dose-coverage/articleshow/87836891.cms||Piyush Bhusari

GIDC is offering plots ranging from 1,500 sqm to 45,000 sqm on long lease as it tries to fund its way out of the debt taken in May 2019 to repay five SEZ promoters. The 22 plots are part of a second tranche of a larger 5 lakh sqm that GIDC has put up for grabs at Verna. The National Informatics Centre (NIC) is e-auctioning the plots on behalf of GIDC. “All the selected bidders of round 1 have already been issued offer of allotment by GIDC,” said a GIDC official. In September, GIDC had put up 31 industrial plots at Verna up for auction. The initial period for the long-term lease is 30 years and the base rate for the plots has been fixed at Rs 5,000 per sqm. “The plots will be allotted to the highest bidder through a two-step process,” said the officer. “The lease can be extended for a total term of 95 years, in case the industry is fully set up and in operation within the first five years,” said a GIDC senior manager.  Of the 5 lakh sqm earmarked for e-auction, only 4.42 lakh sqm will be allotted with the remaining space being developed as open space and utilities. A utility plot has been earmarked for setting up of sub-station by the Goa Electricity Department.  On December 30, 2019, the industries department asked GIDC to auction 5 lakh sqm of the repossessed SEZ land in order to repay the short-term loan of Rs 200 crore taken in May 2019. GIDC had a one-year moratorium on the repayment of principal amount, which ended in May 2020 and since then GIDC has been paying approximately Rs 4 crore in EMIs to repay the loan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gidcs-2nd-lot-of-sezplots-up-for-e-auction/articleshow/87837451.cms||Newton Sequeira

Officials claimed that even before the foresters could reach the tigress, it fled with the dart stuck to her body. The tigress was first caught in camera with the snare in the last week of May. Images showed the snare has caused wounds around her neck. The tigress was later found to be pregnant. It is learnt, the tigress is presently carrying litter with it. The Rapid Response Unit (RRU) from Chandrapur forest division is carrying out the rescue operation. Sources said that on Sunday morning, the forest department shooter sitting on a machan along with a veterinary doctor, a biologist and a range forest officer, had successfully darted the tigress in compartment no. 10 in Shegaon beat. Chief conservator of forest, NR Pravin said that it is not the first time when the tigress has escaped the rescue attempt. “The dart failed to deliver ample amount of drug into the body to sedate her. Hence, the tigress fled,” he said and claimed that similar instances have happened in the past with other tigers too. Sources involved in the operation on Sunday claimed that the tigress was darted at around 6am. It moved away after the dart hit her. Search operation to locate the tigress was launched immediately, they said. The rescue team found the tigress lying in dense shrubs some distance from the place where it was darted. However, by the time it could be traced, the drug’s effect seemed to have waned off. As foresters tried to approach it, the feline stood up and fled, said the sources. NR Pravin said despite the failed attempt, the search operation will continue. Sources claimed that help of Special Tiger Protection Force (STPF) from Tadoba too has been sought. Even as officials claimed that the dart will drop off as the tigress moves on, experts claimed if a special-collared needle has been used in the dart, then there are little chances of it falling on its own. “Such needles have fine hooks which ensure that the dart doesn’t fall off. Sometimes pliers are required to remove such dart from the tranquilized animal,” said experts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tigress-moving-with-wire-snare-darted-escapes-rescue-attempt/articleshow/87837449.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Nashik||Rehabilitate families of farmers who died during agitation: Raut||Nashik: Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Sunday said the Union government and the Prime Minister should take up the work to rehabilitate the family members of the farmers who had died in the past one-and-a-half-year while agitating against the three farm laws. While addressing the media, Raut, who is on a two-day tour of Nashik, said the government should take responsibility for the agitation and its fallout because by repealing the laws and seeking forgiveness, the government has admitted that it was at fault. “The government enacted the laws and the farmers started agitation 1.5 years ago opposing the same. This is the reason that a large number of farmers joined their brethren in fighting for justice and many lost their lives — by suicide, by being killed in police firing or even being marauded. Therefore, if there is a demand for rehabilitation of the families of such farmers, the government should ensure it is done,” Raut said.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi has sought forgiveness from the country for enacting the laws, but that is not enough when it comes to the lives of the farmers, he said. “Their families have been devastated. The government, therefore, should rehabilitate them,” he said. The government could use the funds from PM Care in the interest of the family members of the deceased farmers. “The PM Care fund has a large amount of unaccounted for money. The money can be used by the government to help the farmers’ families as seeking forgiveness alone is not enough,” the MP said. “I am confident that Prime Minister Modi, who is very kind, will do his best to ensure the rehabilitation of the families,” Raut added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/rehabilitate-families-of-farmers-who-died-during-agitation-raut/articleshow/87835632.cms||Abhilash Botekar

At present, a total of 37 oxygen generation plants are functional with the combined capacity of 35 metric tonnes. Of these, Pune rural has 22 plants, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has 12 and the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has three. With the addition of 28 new plants, the district’s oxygen generation capacity will increase to 70-plus metric tonnes. Sanjeev Wavare, assistant medical officer, PMC, told TOI, “We have installed around 12 medical oxygen generation plants across the civic hospitals and six more are proposed. The engineering department is working on it and we are sure that in the next few months, the remaining ones will be installed and made functional.” Sanjay Patil, chairman, Hospital Board of India, said, “The civic bodies’ initiative to install much necessary medical infrastructure in the civic hospitals is a welcome move. We have witnessed the oxygen crisis earlier this year and thankfully, the newly installed oxygen generation plants will avert any such unfortunate situations.” According to Patil, even private hospitals are now upgrading their oxygen requirement by installing plants. “There are many other private hospitals, which are interested in upgradation, however, the financial constraint is the biggest reason for the step back. The medical oxygen generation plant is not only useful in situations like Covid, but for other ailments also,” he said. Apart from the oxygen generation plants, the Pune district’s 19 government-run hospitals have 339 metric tonnes of functional liquid oxygen storage capacity, according to the district health office’s report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/28-new-oxygen-generation-plants-on-the-cards/articleshow/87836900.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Delhi||Delhi: Paying RRTS fare to be hi-speed affair||NEW DELHI: Travelling on the Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) corridor between Meerut and Delhi is expected to be an easy affair as commuters would be able to use their smartphone, credit or debit card and travel smart card of any Metro system in the country to pay for the ticket. RRTS would also be the first transit system where “Premium Class” passengers would have to validate their tickets or cards a second time to board the high-speed train. A spokesperson for National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC), which is executing the project, said a state-of-the-art Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) system would be installed. “The contactless way of entry and exit will be seamless, easy, comfortable and quick,” he added. There would be a fully “Open Loop” system from day one of operations, which would allow different types of smart cards and QR code-based tickets to be used for travelling. This would include credit or debit cards supported by payment networks like RuPay, Mastercard and Visa, which follow National Common Mobility Card (NCMC) standards. “In addition, the smart card issued by NCRTC for travel in RRTS can also be used for retail transactions,” said the spokesperson. A mobile app, apart from NCRTC’s website, would help commuters generate QR code-based tickets. “Paper QR tickets will be available via vending machines at stations for single journeys. NCRTC’s mobile app will also help commuters in recharging their cards, among other functions,” said the official. Each RRTS train on the 82km corridor will have a separate business class coach called “Premium Class”, which would be more spacious and have bigger seats, apart from free on-board Wi-Fi and other facilities like a lounge at stations. “NCRTC will be the first to implement two levels of AFC media validation, one at the concourse level and the second at the platform level. Platform level AFC gates will be provided for access to the Premium Lounge for boarding the Premium Class coach,” said the spokesperson. The installation of the AFC system has been initiated under Make-In-India guidelines of the Union government through Public Private Partnership based on hybrid annuity model. “This is the first of its kind in the country for installation of AFC systems,” the spokesperson said. Currently, it takes about three and a half to four hours to travel by road from Begum Pul in Meerut to Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi. When RRTS becomes operational, passengers would be able to cover the same distance within an hour. “RRTS will improve the overall quality of life of the people of NCR by providing fast, reliable, safe, comfortable and sustainable mobility solution. Construction work is in full swing and the corridor is expected to become operational by 2025,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/paying-rrts-fare-to-be-hi-speed-affair/articleshow/87836909.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Speaking at the US Institute of Peace in Washington on Friday, Kurt Campbell described India as the key “fulcrum” player in Asia.“I’m very bullish about the future with India. I think we all recognise that the critical, crucial member in the Quad is India.” Campbell expanded on his perception of the changed context for India that propelled a famously alliance-shy New Delhi to embrace the Quad and numerous other minilateral groupings. “It's difficult to exaggerate the strategic paradigm for New Delhi (after the border tensions with China in Eastern Ladakh which started in 2020 and is still continuing).” The Quad will not expand for the present, Campbell said, even as he affirmed that there were other countries that showed interest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-central-to-defining-future-of-asia-says-key-biden-aide/articleshow/87838330.cms||---
---||Ranchi||No significant rise in Covid-19 cases post festivity in Jharkhand||RANCHI: Contrary to the apprehensions, Covid-19 cases in Jharkhand have not recorded a sharp surge after the Diwali and Chhath festivities, statistics available with the state department of health and family welfare hinted. On Saturday, nearly 10 days since the completion of Chhath festivities, the state reported 13 new infections and had 130 active cases across the 24 districts. On November 10, Jharkhand had 150 active cases and reported 15 new infections. The graph of infection after Chhath is similar to that during Diwali (November 4), when there were 127 active cases. The department’s data had shown a rise in new infections immediately after Dussehra, when 197 new infections were reported between October 18 and October 24. Post-Dussehra, cases started plummeting. While 137 new infections were reported between October 25 and 31, 118 new cases were documented between November 1 and 7. While Jharkhand’s weekly positivity rate was 0.7% in the week which followed after Durga Puja, it dropped down to 0.04% during Diwali. Doctors and experts, who have been tracking the Covid graph since the pandemic struck Jharkhand in March last year, have attributed the low positivity and fatality rates to several factors. Dr Devesh Kumar of Rims said, “Firstly, no new Covid-19 variant has been reported. In addition, due to vaccination and exposure, a large section of the state’s population has already developed immunity against the virus. The improved immunity has also reduced the fatalities to a negligible level even though the cases registered a significant rise during the festive season compared to previous months.” He added, “It will be safe to say that the worst of the pandemic is behind us. However, testing needs to be done and surveillance should be enhanced to detect any new or virulent variant.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/no-significant-rise-in-cov-cases-post-festivity-in-state/articleshow/87836689.cms||Dhritiman Ray

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand, BRO and Ladakh to ink MoU to safeguard state’s contractual workers||RANCHI: The Jharkhand government is set to sign a tripartite agreement with the Union territory of Ladakh and the Border Roads Organization (BRO) to establish a Safe and Responsible Migration Centre (SRMC) in Ladakh, which will safeguard the interests of the contractual workers from the state. The BRO agreed to sign the agreement and empanel itself as an employment agency with the Jharkhand government during a meeting with officers of the state labour department and the Union territory at Ladakh on October 29 this year. The central organisation also agreed to do away with the “middlemen”, commonly known as mates, while hiring workers from the state. Each year, over 18,000 men were engaged in BRO’s infrastructure development projects in Ladakh, Jammu & Kashmir and Uttarakhand across three seasons. Primarily hailing from districts in the tribal-dominated Santhal Pargana division, these workers are hired by mates, who pay them frugally and provide them with little amenities in high altitudes and harsh weather. Once the SRMC is established, it will serve as a one-stop communication centre for the workers in times of exigencies and also for grievance redressal. State labour secretary Prawin Kumar Toppo, who attended the tripartite meeting, said the BRO has been asked to provide a complete database of its contractual workers with the governments of Jharkhand and Ladakh, beginning this winter. “Moreover, the state labour department will also draft a memorandum of understanding (MoU), which will be inked between the state, the BRO and the Ladakh government. The MoU will lay down clauses for transparency in the rules of engagement of the workers and safeguarding their interests,” Toppo said. Notably, Jharkhand has been negotiating with the BRO for higher wages, health insurance, extra allowances and other amenities for the state’s contractual workers since June last year. The miseries of the workers were first brought to the notice of chief minister Hemant Soren by a batch of 60 stranded migrants who were brought to Ranchi by the state government during the nationwide lockdown in May last year. Subsequently, the Jharkhand government had temporarily denied permission to the BRO to transport roughly 15,000 workers from Santhal Pargana in special trains in June and demanded that their terms of engagement be revised first.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jkhand-bro-and-ladakh-to-ink-mou-to-safeguard-states-contractual-workers/articleshow/87836755.cms||Dhritiman Ray

The selection committee chaired by speaker Ravindra Nath Mahto decided to honour Chandravanshi this year with Birsa Munda Memorial best legislator award. The assembly also honours best staff for which five people — joint secretary Ramnivas Das, additional secretary Neelesh Kumar Singh, branch manager Roshan Kido and Subhash Kumar along with grade four staff Umesh Kumar Gupta have been selected. Chandravanshi is the 18th legislator to receive this award. Though this is an annual feature, the award ceremony was disrupted in the election years and no legislator was awarded in 2009, 2014 and 2019. In 2020, JMM legislator Nalin Soren was selected for the honour. Chandravanshi, who was earlier with the RJD, joined the BJP in 2014 and served as health minister in the Raghubar Das government. Known for his courteous behaviour on floor of the house, he is among those rare MLAs against whom there is no criminal case. Chandravanshi was elected to the Bihar assembly for the first time in 1995. He lost in first Jharkhand assembly but was elected in 2005, 2014 and 2019 assembly elections. Hailing from Daltonganj, Chandravanshi is popular as an educationist and social worker. He is credited to have laid the foundation of several institutions of higher education in remote Palamu division. The speaker convened a meeting with officials of the state government to review last-minute preparations for the foundation day celebration. He said the selection of best legislator and best assembly staff is a major task. “The committee comprises parliamentary affairs minister Alam Gir Alam, senior BJP MLA Neelkanth Singh Munda, senior JMM legislator Stephen Marandi and convener of press advisory committee Anand Mohan. The committee discussed several names and finally selected one member on merit,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/chandravanshi-best-legislator-as-jharkhand-assembly-turns-21-today/articleshow/87836771.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Ranchi||BGH doctors perform rare spinal surgery||Bokaro: A team of doctors at Bokaro General Hospital (BGH) performed a minimal invasive surgery called balloon kyphoplasty for the first time on a 65-year-old woman who had fractured her spine. Doctors said the spinal compression fracture was at multiple levels in the vertebra. The surgery, which was done with fluoroscopic imaging guidance, elevated the compressed vertebra with the help of balloon and bone cement to bring it to normal shape. The surgery was done two days ago and the patient will be released in another couple of days, officials said on Saturday. Bokaro Steel Plant spokesperson Manikant Dhan said patient Tirthi Devi is recovering well. Tirthi is a resident of Mango village under Chas block. “Balloon kyphoplasty is a minimally invasive treatment for spinal compression fractures. The kyphoplasty surgery uses a small balloon that gently lifts bone fragments into their correct position,” said Dr Anand Kumar, head of neurosurgery department of BGH. Tirthi’s son Ashwini Kumar said, “My mother suffered spinal injury after she slipped in the bathroom in September last week. She was suffering from severe back pain, difficulty in walking and standing. She needed constant support. She took medications but got no relief.” When Tirthi was brought to BGH, doctors of the neurosurgery department diagnosed her with osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture. Dr Anand, who did the surgery, said the patient had an old injury which led to similar compression fracture at another vertebral level. Dr Anand consulted with BGH director Dr Pankaj Sharma and decided to perform balloon khyphoplasty. Tirthi’s husband Dhaneshwar Mallah, a retired employee of BSL, gave his consent to the procedure. Dr Anand along with his team, including Dr Mohit Kumar, Dr Pradeep Kumar, Dr Gautam Saha (head of anaesthesia department), Dr Ajay and Dr Rajmohan, performed the surgery which lasted two and a half hours. Dr Anand said the surgery gives good results and is gradually finding favour in India. “But it is still rarely performed in eastern India,” he said. Dr Anand added, “In this surgery we make a pathway into the fractured vertebra using a hollow instrument. A small balloon is then guided through the instrument into the bone. Once in position, the balloon is slowly inflated to gently raise the collapsed bone into its normal position. When the bone is in the correct position, we deflate and remove the balloon. To prevent the bone from collapsing again, the void is filled with orthopaedic cement.

The deceased, Safal Hasda, was killed by Hadma Kisku in Ranchara village under Borio police station of Sahebganj district on Saturday night with a sharp weapon, police said. Police added that Safal lived at his in-laws’ house for last few years, while his wife Nanamay Kisku worked in Kerala as a migrant labourer to run the house. This irked Hadma over the years prompting him to commit the crime. "The accused often used to scold his son-in-law for not doing any work which resulted in a heated exchange of words between them on Saturday night. In fit of rage, he attacked Safal with a sharp-edged weapon causing his death," Jagarnath Pan, officer in charge (OC) of Borio police station said quoting the accused’s wife. Police recovered the body on Sunday after being informed by the village head about the incident. "The accused is absconding but according to his wife, he left home in the morning stating that he was going to surrender,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/man-killed-by-father-in-law-for-being-jobless/articleshow/87836849.cms||---

Officials of the zoo, which is owned and run by the Bokaro Steel Plant (BSL), said they are focussing to provide natural solutions rather than installing heaters to keep the animals warm. “We are trimming branches of trees so that sufficient sunlight could enter the enclosures,” BSL’s chief of communication, Manikant Dhan, said. Dhan also said they will also install room heaters inside the enclosures based on the need. Zoo employees are also making arrangements to light bonfires at strategic places, especially near the enclosures of deer and blackbucks. "Deer like to sit a few feet away from the fire to stay warm. The enclosures have also been equipped with hay and wooden planks,” he said. Curtains are also being put up on the enclosures housing leopards, tigers, and lions to stop cold waves from entering. To protect snakes, civets and birds from the cold, Dhan said straws were placed around their enclosures. “The zoo staff also provides vitamins to the animals,” he added. The zoo is spread on a 127-acre land in Sector IV of the town and is home to a variety of animals, birds and trees. A total of 26 animal enclosures are located in the zoo. Currently, around 1,500 people visit the zoo daily and the number surges during winter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bokaro-zoo-gets-ready-for-winter/articleshow/87836805.cms||Divy Khare

Two days ago, JSLPS inked a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Sightsavers India in Ranchi paving way for a four-year tie-up for work in this tribal heartland. JSLPS officials on Sunday said that formal rollout of activities on the ground will kick off in next couple of weeks. JSLS CEO Nancy Sahay said that they had also released a manual — Pathways to Inclusive Employment (employer’s guide) — during the MoU signing event to encourage inclusive practices by private companies. She said, “Ensuring an inclusive work culture is crucial for integration of disabled persons in workplaces. Corporates have the potential to support disabled persons to find work. They can make a start and their assistance can make a huge difference in the lives of people with disabilities.” Sightsavers India’s CEO, R N Mohanty added that regardless of the legal mandates, most organisations avoid recruiting people with disabilities due to a negative outlook and erroneous assumptions. But with the right awareness, experiences, mindfulness and display of positivity, employers can understand that making an inclusive working environment is beneficial for both the organisation and the employees with disabilities, he said. “People with disabilities still face many hindrances when it comes to fair and equitable labour participation. Employment-related barriers through real can be overcome. Sightsavers India through its social inclusion programme aims to construct employability as an intrinsic part of the economic strengthening of persons with disabilities, engaging employers and ensuring that persons with disabilities lead a life of independence and dignity,” he said. On their line of action, Sahay said that they will be working at three levels — sensitising employers, skilling persons with disability and creating opportunities for them. There are about two lakh people with disability in Jharkhand, as per the registered number of beneficiaries under different government schemes for disability. “In a phased manner, JSLPS will roll out different activities exclusively crafted for such persons in coming weeks. For training and skilling, we will be utilising the network of DDU and GJKY training centres across the state to prepare them for job markets,” Sahay said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jslps-sightsavers-india-join-hands-to-create-respectable-work-culture-for-disabled/articleshow/87836904.cms||---

---||Jamshedpur||Finger at Modi govt for death of protesting farmers||JAMSHEDPUR: State health and disaster management minister Banna Gupta has alleged the Centre was responsible for the death of 750 farmers while protesting against the three farm laws. He said the farmers who died during the agitation should be considered as martyrs. The kin of the deceased farmers must get adequate compensation along with a government job, he added. Gupta said nearly 10,000 cases filed against the protesting farmers should be immediately withdrawn. Hitting out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Gupta claimed the farmers don’t trust him and hence are not withdrawing their agitation even after the announcement on repeal of the three farm legislations. The minister said it is extremely shameful that people of the country do not trust the Prime Minister. Gupta alleged the lack of faith on the Prime Minister has increased over the years. He said Modi had promised to give jobs to 2 crore youths annually, which he could not fulfil in his first tenure nor in the second term which began in 2019. “The promise of bringing back all the black money kept offshore has also turned out to be a hoax,” he said. Taking a further dig at Modi, Gupta said after notebandi (demonetisation), the economy is in the doldrums and people are suffering. He said the Congress will stand behind the farmers in their agitation and fight for their rights. The minister claimed the Modi government was forced to repeal the three farm laws as pre-poll surveys by international agencies have suggested the BJP will lose in the Uttar Pradesh election early next year. “So as a last-minute effort to save their boat, they have taken the decision,” Gupta said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/finger-at-modi-govt-for-death-of-protesting-farmers/articleshow/87836705.cms||Debasish Chatterjee

Coming days ahead of the November 25 Agartala Municipal Corporation polls, in which TMC is contesting all 51 wards, there were reports of violence against Trinamool workers, allegedly by BJP men, prompting a Trinamool delegation of MPs to seek an appointment with President Ram Nath Kovind and Union home minister Amit Shah, protesting against repeated attacks against them. A Trinamool team left for Delhi on Sunday night. There were reports of renewed violence against TMC workers near the East Agartala Women police station, where Ghosh was detained before her arrest, late in the evening as well. According to reports, unidentified attackers struck the police station, injuring a journalist and some others. A separate attack was carried out in TMC Tripura state convener Subal Bhowmik’s home. Reports suggested Ghosh was whisked away under security cover to an undisclosed location by police. TMC’s Rajya Sabha MP Sushmita Dev alleged she tried repeatedly to reach out to the police, but failed . The developments came a day before Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee’s four-day visit to Delhi. Party national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee will leave for Tripura on Monday to attend a pre-scheduled road show in Agartala. CM Deb not ‘bothered’ about SC orders, democracy being mocked: AbhishekTrinamool leader Saayoni Ghosh was arrested at 4pm on Sunday after being questioned for three hours at East Agartala Women police station. She will be produced in court on Monday. While she was being questioned, at least seven Trinamool workers were injured in sudden attacks, allegedly by BJP cadres. Several vehicles were vandalised. Police lathicharged to disperse the attackers, who, by several accounts, were masked, armed with sticks and bricks, and wearing helmets. The Bengal CM and Trinamool national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee had spoken to Ghosh while she was detained at the police station. Abhishek even tried to bring forward his Tripura visit to Sunday evening, but his flight wasn’t given permission to land, said sources. Sunday’s chain of events seemed to have its roots in Saturday evening, when Ghosh, passing by the Tripura CM’s rally at Ashram Chowmuhani , made some sarcastic comments. In the clip she tweeted, she is heard saying there were “too few” people attending the CM’s rally, apart from pitching the “Khela Hobe” slogan. Ghosh claimed in the video that her vehicle was attacked immediately after these comments, but she was unhurt. BJP leaders alleged Ghosh’s car had hit two persons, who were injured and had to be hospitalised. “She has been booked under sections 153, 153A, 307 and 120B IPC,” said Bogati Jagadeeswar Reddy, ASP (West). “The sections also relate to promoting enmity between groups of people. The video transcript will be produced in court. There were four more people in the car. We are trying to trace them.” Trinamool MP Sushmita Dev alleged that a section of policemen were involved in hatching a conspiracy, along with BJP cadres. “They trapped all of us in the police station since morning. As soon as we reached, a large number of BJP cadres wearing helmets and face masks, armed with sticks and stones stormed the police station. A vehicle was damaged, the properties of the police station were destroyed, and they assaulted our people inside the police station. But Saayoni was arrested, not them.” Dev also questioned how “BJP goons” had information that Ghosh and other Trinamool leaders would be detained at the police station. Abhishek posted a video of the attack on Trinamool workers outside the police station, commenting that CM Biplab Deb wasn’t even “bothered” about the Supreme Court orders. “He has repeatedly sent goons to attack our supporters and our female candidates instead of ensuring their safety! Democracy being mocked under @BJP4Tripura,” he tweeted. Trinamool leader Subal Bhowmik alleged that police brought Ghosh from the hotel to the police station for interrogation without any notice in the morning. “Last evening, senior TMC leaders Babul Supriyo and Firhad Hakim were attacked by BJP goons in two places. A TMC candidate and several others have been shifted to hospital with critical injuries following the attack, but police did nothing,” he alleged. TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said: “Her arrest is illegal. Police have not arrested any of the BJP workers who have created trouble outside the police station.” Tripura BJP spokesperson Nabendu Bhattacharya accused TMC of fomenting trouble. “There are videos, and other proof to show the vandalism spread by TMC workers. A Bengal minister had come here and claimed that they would finish BJP off in five minutes. They have hired goons to create nuisance. Now they will have to face the consequences,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agartala/tmc-neta-held-in-tripura-thana-attacked/articleshow/87841272.cms||Biswendu Bhattacharjee

---||Goa||All Iffi infrastructure today is due to Parrikar’s efforts: Thakur||Panaji: Union minister for information and broadcasting (I&B) Anurag Singh Thakur on Sunday said that in the coming years, efforts will be made to institute awards for technical staff at the International Film Festival of India (Iffi). He was speaking at the opening of the Indian Panorama section at the 52nd Iffi. Thakur paid homage to former Goa chief minister Manohar Parrikar for creating the infrastructure for Iffi in Goa. “We promise to take Iffi to new heights in the coming years. I remember Manohar Parrikar ji, for whom Iffi was very close to his heart. All this infrastructure that we see today for Iffi, it is due to his efforts,” Thakur said. The Union minister said that at other film festivals, technicians and others are already being awarded for their work behind the scenes on a film. “We are also working on the same. Why should Iffi be behind other film festivals?” he said. He also said that today, regional filmmakers have a responsibility to create content which can rival the best in the world. Thakur said that he wants to take regional content from India to the international platform, which is possible in today’s digital world. “It is very important that regional content goes to the national and international level and today it is possible. If you are creating the right content, then it is not restricted only to the regional language. It becomes national and international soon. So, the content is the king. We are the world’s largest film producers. But, at the same time, how many films are acknowledged at the international level?” Thakur said. India can also lead the world in post-production of films by offering skills in animation, visuals and graphics sector, he said. Thakur and the governor of Himachal Pradesh, Rajendra Arlekar, felicitated the jury members of Indian Panorama section and the filmmakers whose 24 feature and 20 non-feature films have been chosen this year to be screened at Iffi under the section. The cast and crew of the opening feature film Semkhor and the opening non-feature film Ved - The Visionary were also felicitated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/all-iffi-infrastructure-today-is-due-to-parrikars-efforts-thakur/articleshow/87837220.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: How this gang used Facebook to peddle firearms||NEW DELHI: The Intelligence Fusion and Strategic Ops (IFSO) unit of Delhi Police has busted a module involved in selling illegal firearms through Facebook and other social media platforms. The mastermind of the syndicate, who belongs to Rajasthan and is involved in 11 cases, has been arrested. A hunt is on for the others. The arrested man, Hitesh Singh Thakur alias Langda (38), is a resident of Jodhpur. He had supplied arms and ammunition to criminals and had even tied up with the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, police said. DCP KPS Malhotra said their investigation revealed Thakur's links in Pakistan and with other people through virtual numbers on WhatsApp and social media platforms. "Many first-timers who approached him on Facebook were cheated too," he added. Hitesh Singh alias LangdaThe crime came to the fore during social media monitoring by IFSO, which noticed that several Facebook profiles/Urls had shared posts and videos offering sale of arms and weapons. They had also displayed photographs and videos of weapons and ammunition. The most prominent group was in Bishnoi's name. This rang alarm bells given the Rohini court shootout in which gangster Jitender Gogi was killed. It triggered fears of retaliation by his allies, like Bishnoi. An FIR was registered at IFSO and a team comprising ACP Raman Lamba, inspector Parveen and others was formed to investigate the case. During investigation, Facebook profiles related to Bishnoi were searched and it was found that among his friends/members list, Hitesh Rajput also had a separate profile in the name of Hirpal Singh. He was offering to sell firearms. "Through technical surveillance and human intelligence, the active profiles of Hirpal Singh were identified. A deal was struck on Facebook and communication was undertaken on various social media platforms. During communication, videos of weapons were shared by Hirpal and the advance money was deposited in the bank account provided by him," said Malhotra. A trap was subsequently laid and the suspect was apprehended from Manesar in Haryana when he came to receive the remaining amount. After his arrest, his phone was forensically examined, which generated further clues. "Thakur is a habitual offender and has been lodged in various jails of Rajasthan. While he was an undertrial, he developed connections with other criminals. It was revealed that he used to cheat many budding criminals and supplied arms to notorious criminals or gang members after verification," said the DCP. During interrogation, Thakur revealed that he had started his criminal activities in 2010. His friend and he committed burglary at a book shop. After coming out of jail, he started stealing bikes and selling them. In jail, he met a dacoit, Dhan Singh Peeproli, and started working for him.

The increase in this category was from Rs 2,000 to Rs 2 lakh, and the notification was with retrospective effect from January 1, 2018. "The demand is excessive, disproportionate and pays no heed at all to well-known pandemic and lockdown circumstances, ones that have even resulted in judicial orders extending periods of limitation and even ordering the temporary cessation of municipal actions against illegal structures," said the high court in its order. The order, by a bench of Justices Gautam Patel and Madhav Jamdar, was passed on November 17 on a petition by Baywatch Restaurant and Bar owner Anitha Shetty, who challenged the hike notification issued in December 2019 by the police commissioner. The bar is located in Dadar (E). The bench said, "We are also not even remotely satisfied that a retrospective demand like this can be made in law. This is a question that we will address at a later stage."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-stays-100x-hike-in-licence-fees-for-orchestra-bars/articleshow/87838488.cms||Swati Deshpande

For the first time, more non-feature than feature films will be screened under this section. Konkani film ‘Gagan’, directed by Supraj Kerkar and produced by Brijesh Kakodkar is a 24-minute short-film that speaks of the broken relationship between a father and son. ‘Limits’ is a Marathi film of 36-minute duration, produced and directed by Vardhan Kamat. The filmmakers were delighted and told of the struggles they went through to make their films. “The film is shot with whatever limited resources we had. We also built track and trolley within eight days to shoot this film. The film is shot at three different places and the shoot was completed within three days. It is of five one-take scenes and hence coordination of every cast and crew member was crucial,” Kamat said. ‘Limits’ revolves around two female protagonists, Neha and Manasi, working in corporate jobs in a metropolitan city of India and representing the same generation yet different ideologies about work-life balance, freedoms and restrictions. ‘Kupamcho Daryeo’, a 19-minute film in Konkani directed by Himanshu Singh and produced by Kishor Arjun Shinde will also be screened at Iffi’s Goan film section. ‘D’Costa House’ will be the only feature film to be screened in the section. The film has been produced by Pramod Salgaocar and directed by Jitendra Shikerkar and is of 2 hours and 14 minutes duration. This also is a Konkani film. Of the five films, only one will be a non-premiere film – ‘Paul 10’. The Konkani film is 19-minute-long and directed by Sunil Revankar and produced by Roopa Ramesh Revankar. Vice-president of Entertainment Society of Goa, Subhash Faldesai said that noted film personalities were brought in to shortlist the Goan films for the section.

---||Mumbai||Elders' share in Mumbai Covid toll up, nears pre-vaccination days||MUMBAI: Six months after being immunised with both doses, Kandivli resident Sharadchandra Shenoy (63) succumbed to Covid-19 pneumonia in October. The 63-year-old, who had a history of hypertension and diabetes, battled the viral infection for 13 days in hospital. The family is still searching for answers, said his brother Dr Satishchandra Shenoy, a family physician. While Covid-19 deaths in Mumbai continue to see a steady drop over the months, the proportion of senior citizens in fatalities, which had considerably fallen after the start of immunisation, is rising once again and nearing levels in pre-vaccination days. Experts say the trend calls for studies on depleting antibody levels, an urgent debate on third dose for the vulnerable population and an analysis of comorbidities, reports Sumitra Deb Roy. 'Elders will account for big share of toll due to comorbidities'BMC data shows that senior citizens accounted for 76% of Covid deaths in January, 84% in February and 80% in March. As vaccination opened for the elderly in March, their share of deaths dropped to 65% in April, while that of people between 40-60 years touched 30%, up from 14% in March (see graphic). In September and October, however, their proportion rose to 79% and 80%, respectively, almost like the pre-vaccination months. Dr Avinash Supe, who heads Mumbai's Covid-19 death audit committee, underlined that vaccination has brought down the death count. "But, a small pool of deaths is likely to be there, and senior citizens will account for the lion's share because of comorbidities." A majority of Covid deaths in Mumbai at present are among the unvaccinated, susceptible people, like senior citizens with comorbidities and those who didn't have adequate antibody production after vaccination. BMC data shows that 75% to 82% of Covid victims have one or the other comorbidity, like hypertension, diabetes, heart or kidney condition. From the peak of 1,475 and 1,723 deaths registered in April and May, Mumbai's toll dropped to 134 in September and 137 in October, said Dr Supe, adding it was mainly due to vaccination. An answer to whether depletion of antibody levels is making senior citizens susceptible cannot be found till such studies have been done, said Dr Rahul Pandit, an intensivist and member of state Covid task force. But, he is of the opinion that a discussion on booster shot for senior citizens should start now. BMC has sought the opinion of the task force on the matter, said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner. "Vaccination of senior citizens began in March...concerns are their antibody levels may have gone down. But since giving a booster shot is a larger decision, we will wait to hear from the task force."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/elders-share-in-mumbai-covid-toll-up-nears-pre-vaccination-days/articleshow/87838515.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Nagpur||BJP blames state govt for inadequate compensation to farmers||Nagpur: Blaming the state government for providing “inadequate” compensation to farmers whose crops got destroyed due to natural disasters, the BJP today said it was being done to benefit crop insurance companies. BJP’s Pradesh Kissan Morcha mahamantri Anandraro Raut said farmers were denied their rights, only to ensure maximum profit for crop insurance companies. “In Maharashtra, we have seen crops being destroyed due to natural disasters, and the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has rubbed salt in our farmers’ wounds by announcing the lowest possible compensation package,” he said. Raut, who was accompanied at the press conference by BJP’s Nagpur rural chief Arvind Gajbhiye, said insurance companies are reaping bumper profits. “Just last year, they made a profit of over Rs4,000 crore. Very few farmers are able to get the benefit which is actually due to them. Apart from this, the loan waiver package too is inadequate. Only Rs150 crore provision has been made,” said Raut. He added, “Before coming to power, both Uddhav Thackeray and Ajit Pawar would demand high compensation for farmers, but now when they have got the chance to do it, we see a different result.” Raut said this “exposes their dual-faced policy”. “In Marathwada, Vidarbha and western Maharashtra around 50 lakh hectares of crop has been destroyed. Shiv Sena, which was at the forefront for calling a bandh for Uttar Pradesh farmers, has failed to do anything for its own people,” said the BJP member. Raut went on to allege that due to the MVA’s “profiteering”, farmers in Maharashtra were being forced to die by suicide. A Congress leader who did not wish to be named said, “These are baseless allegations and the crux of the matter is that BJP is trying to divert attention from the farm laws debacle. They have been defeated by honest farmers and now want to raise their popularity in the farming community. So what better way to do this than to blame the Maharashtra government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-blames-state-govt-for-inadequate-compensation-to-farmers/articleshow/87837366.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Nagpur||‘CM’s Rs15 lakh package, job offer are eyewash’||Nagpur: Even as condolences poured in over the tragic death of forest guard Swati Dhumne in Tadoba, there was criticism that the chief minister’s announcement of Rs15 lakh aid to her next of kin and a job for her husband were just a formality and nothing new. Condoling the death of Dhumne, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday announced the kin of the forest guard would be given Rs15 lakh as per the forest department budgetary provision, and a job in the forest department. Ajay Patil, central president of Maharashtra State Forest Guards and Promoted Foresters Sanghatana, said, “The CM’s announcement is mere eyewash. As per the state GR issued in 2018, the compensation in case of attack by wild animals is Rs15 lakh. This is also applicable to any person who is fatally attacked by wild animals prescribed in the list.” Secondly, Patil said the announcement of the job to the kin of Dhumne is also not new. As per the existing provisions, a job is given to the immediate kin of the deceased employees. So, Dhumne’s husband getting a job is also not a new thing. “The chief minister should have given at least Rs50 lakh in the name of her daughter for future education and needs. TATR should immediately stop estimation work till safety measures are in place,” Patil said. Patil recalled when forest guard Madanlal Verma was shot dead by the timber mafia at Dewas on February 4, 2021. Madhy Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan not only granted status of ‘shahid’ to the victim but also announced an ex-gratia of Rs1 crore to his kin and a job. “Why can’t Maharashtra CM take a similar stand?” he asked. According to PCCF (wildlife) Sunil Limaye, a cheque of Rs5 lakh and Rs50,000 cash have been handed over to the kin of Dhumne from Tiger Conservation Foundation (TCF). Her service dues will also be released next week. “We will make a sound financial plan for her 4-year-old daughter from various sources and government,” said Limaye. However, sources said, “The Rs5 lakh aid is from TCF. But the Rs50,000 aid will be adjusted in Rs15 lakh human kill compensation as per GR.” Patil said, “The Rs15 lakh package is the same as what other tiger attack victims get. The job offer to the dependent is also mandatory as per the GR. So, Thackeray’s announcement is a cruel joke on Dhumne. This meagre compensation is unacceptable.” Meanwhile, Dhumne’s death was also condoled by Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav. “I’m deeply saddened by the death of Dhumne. Our forest front line heroes are doing a great job, fraught with risks,” Yadav said. The IFS Association (Central) too said Dhumne gave the supreme sacrifice in the line of duty when she was engaged in All India Tiger Estimation (AITE)-2022. Jamni-Pandharpaoni road closed Stung by Dhumne’s death, the TATR management has closed the Jamni-Pandharpaoni road for tourism as a matter of precaution. Since Sunday evening no vehicles were allowed on the 6-km stretch. Now tourists won’t be able to visit two hotspots — Water Hole 97 and Yenbodi — the most frequented areas by tigress Maya, who killed the woman forest guard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cms-rs15-lakh-package-job-offer-are-eyewash/articleshow/87837388.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Nagpur||CBSE schools brace for online Q papers in major exams starting next week||Nagpur: The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is sending question papers for its ongoing Term-1 board exams online, following which schools download, print and distribute these in a specified time-frame. But with major exams starting next week, schools now have to brace for the logistical challenge of printing hundreds of copies within a limited time. As reported by TOI earlier, the CBSE is conducting board exam in two phases for 2021-22 academic session. The first phase, called Term-1, is currently underway and so far only the minor (optional) subjects have been held. A CBSE principal said, “Once the major papers start, the number of printouts needed will be much higher. Since all this has to be done an hour or so before the exam, we cannot afford to have any technical issues either with the printer or the power supply.” For example, the current student load of say 40 to 50 students will jump to almost 400 once the major exams start. Though number of examinees will vary from centre to centre, there is no denying the fact that numbers jump multifold once the major exams start. CBSE has tested the system through mock drills and at least in Maharashtra, no major problems have been found. A senior CBSE principal said, “No one has yet said that it can’t be done. Every school, which is an exam centre, has equipped itself with high speed printers and power backup system. Some have even called printing service provider company to send a technician to school on standby, though I think it’s going a bit overboard.” Another principal said, “Each day before the exam starts, at a specific time we have to download the paper from the online portal created for exam management. The paper can be downloaded after entering the key (code) which is generated at that very moment. During this entire process, neutral observers are present to ensure the process is fair.” Once downloaded, the question paper has to be printed, as per the number of students appearing. A CBSE school teacher said if the online question paper delivery system becomes a norm, then major logistical burden will be removed. “Earlier, physical question paper would have to be stored with custodian banks. Then to transport the same to centres in rural areas was another challenge. That massive exercise held across the country will now be eliminated, all thanks to the online question papers,” she said. Same day valuation The current Term-1 exam answersheets are OMR-based, and a strategy being used by CBSE will see results coming faster. Schools are evaluating the OMR sheets on the same day and uploading marks. “The physical OMR sheets will still be sent by post, but this same day evaluation will save a lot of time,” a teacher said. “I have not discussed in detail, but it’s clear that by the time the physical OMR sheets reach CBSE, marks would have been uploaded already. Then scanning of OMR will only be in a way cross-checking, so results will come very fast,” said the teacher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cbse-schools-brace-for-online-q-papers-in-major-exams-starting-next-week/articleshow/87837411.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Currently, SECR boasts of India’s longest stretch of 31km bidirectional track with automated signalling system between Rajnandgaon and Dongargarh. The system is also operational on the 8km stretch between Bortalao and Darekasa. Work is in progress in stretches like Rajnandgaon to Durg, Durg to Dongargaon and a few in Bhandara. Successful technical and technological application has already helped SECR record a highest exchanges of 215 trains in a day and achieve the fastest average speed of over 62 kmph for goods train. According to sources in SECR, the Railway Board has set a deadline of March 2022 to complete bulk of the bidirectional track work with automated signalling system on the third line between Rajnandgaon and Durg. The new system would reduce operational time at railway stations by supplanting the existing manual absolute block signalling system which allows only one train on a section between two stations at a time. “Each block sections is of 10-15km. In automatic signalling system, the sections are split into smaller sub-sections which allows the facility to run multiple trains,” said an official. The signals are operated automatically with the passage of train. Thus, more trains will be travelling between two stations. “The trains coming from behind are given the signal to enter the sub-section once it is clear,” said the official adding that automatic signalling can be implemented within couple of years without fresh land acquisitions. It’s learnt, the Railways is on the verge of introducing multi-section digital axle counters with standby provisions to provide automatic signalling. “Display screens will be provided at stations to monitor trains moving in the automatic signalling section,” said the official. The system, from the security point of view, is also hailed as a ‘fail-safe’ design. “If the green signal fails, the next permissive signal ‘double yellow’ will be displayed. If ‘single yellow’ fails, ‘red’ will be displayed. If the ‘red’ signals fails, the standby ‘red’ signal will be displayed,” said the official adding the system helps eliminate human error. According to Maninder Uppal, SECR divisional railway manager, Nagpur Division, the automatic signalling system has helped the division achieve unprecedented momentum in freight carriages and frequency of trains. “The speed of goods train in Nagpur Division is a benchmark in Indian Railway due to the system,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/secr-plans-bidirectional-track-with-automated-signalling-on-kalamna-durg-stretch/articleshow/87837434.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Goa||First candidate list by early Deceber: Congress||PANAJI: Congress has begun the process to shortlist candidates for the 2022 assembly elections and will announce its first list by November end or early December, state party president Girish Chodankar said on Sunday. The party has already constituted an election screening committee. Chodankar also insisted that the party will select new faces and younger candidates for 80% of the constituencies. However, Congress will not project a chief ministerial candidate ahead of the elections and will decide on the post only after the poll results come in, he said. In the 2017 assembly elections, Congress won 17 seats in the 40-member House, restricting BJP to 13, but disagreements over the chief minister’s post and other factors had allowed BJP to gain the upper hand and form a coalition government. “People want the candidates to be declared early. Our process of shortlisting candidates for the Goa polls will gather momentum as the party has announced a screening committee for Goa. At least 70% to 80% of Congress candidates will be young and new,” Chodankar said. All India Congress Committee (AICC) has picked MPs Rajni Patil and Hibi Eden, Dhruv Narayan, AICC in-charge of Goa desk, Dinesh Gundu Rao, Chodankar and opposition leader Digambar Kamat leader to finalise the candidates’ names. A pradesh election committee will shortlist the candidates picked by the various blocks and submit it to the screening committee. Chodankar and Rao insisted that none of the 10 MLAs who left the party and joined BJP will be considered. While Chodankar refused to comment on a pre-poll alliance, Rao had confirmed that the party is talking to the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Goa Forward Party (GFP) and Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP). “As far as I know, the parties that have come forward to have an alliance, talks are on with them. But I don’t know the details,” Chodankar said. “The party’s strategists will take a decision based on what the party needs and what the people of Goa want.” Chodankar said block committees of the party will be taken into confidence while deciding the candidates. “More importance would be given to the candidates recommended by the block committees in respective constituencies,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/first-candidate-list-by-early-dec-cong/articleshow/87836871.cms||---

The NCB has identified the accused as Akhil and Nishad. Both of them were receivers to whom the parcels were addressed to. According to the NCB, the arrests were made as part of a probe into the seizure of drugs sent via courier service from Bengaluru. On November 11, a team of NCB officials of the Bengaluru zonal office intercepted a parcel containing 40g of methamphetamine, a dangerous synthetic drug. The parcel was supposed to reach Akhil in Thiruvananthapuram. Following this lead, the NCB officials reached the city and picked up Akhil. Nishad was arrested by the officials of NCB's sub-office in Kochi after they intercepted another parcel similarly. This time, however, the officials waited till the consignment reached the addressee at Chirayinkeezhu before intercepting the package and apprehending the accused on November 16. The parcel contained 244g of amphetamine, 25 stamps of LSD and 2g of methaqualone. The NCB authorities said that both catches were made following specific inputs regarding drug mafia utilizing parcel services to smuggle the contraband. However, they have not yet been able to establish any apparent links between Akhil and Nishad. Though their source of drug procurement was from Bengaluru, they seem to be running separate operations in Thiruvananthapuram, NCB sources said. The NCB authorities also said that the drug mafia might have opted for innovative modes such as courier services to smuggle the contraband owing to the adverse weather conditions involving heavy rains and cyclones. Methamphetamine/amphetamine and other synthetic drugs are very potent and dangerous stimulant drugs. It is commonly abused as a party drug. The side-effects of these drugs are also very dangerous on the human body as they affect the central nervous system. Continuous usage can lead to heart problems, including heart attack, memory lapses, hallucinations and seizures, said a statement issued by NCB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/drugs-smuggling-2-arrested-in-thiruvananthapuram/articleshow/87838566.cms||---

The panchayat has also given a strict warning to the villagers to handle their garbage carefully before giving it to the garbage collectors. Cortalim sarpanch Senia Pereira said, “Our villagers are educated and responsible people. Many times we have made announcements and requested the villagers to segregate the garbage. Now, we have decided to impose fines.” Apart from this, there were several questions raised by the villagers on the market complex project, the flyover work, the mobile towers and others. Cortalim MLA Alina Saldanha said, “The gram sabha wanted to know more about the market complex project. The shops are auctioned as per the rules and regulations set by the government. There will be a separate gram sabha in which we will discuss the market complex. Also, experts on mobile towers will be called as the gram sabha has raised objection to towers citing health effects.” She added that the towers cannot be gotten rid of as student’s online education is dependent on connectivity. A villager, Adv Tommy Carvalho, said, “There were many issues raised by the villagers. Dilip Buildcon has dug the roads and blocked the way to the crematorium. Our drainage system and roads are in bad condition. These need to be sorted out with the contractor and the public work’s department.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/unsegregated-waste-cortalim-pyat-to-levy-fine/articleshow/87836894.cms||---

Police have detained 11 people in this connection. Muharram Sheikh was returning home after a meeting at the party office in Canning in South 24 Parganas when he was shot multiple times. He was first taken to Canning Hospital and then to SSKM Hospital after his condition deteriorated. He succumbed to his injuries. According to police, Sheikh, the local Trinamool Youth Congress president, was returning home around 8 30 pm on his bike when three youths jumped off an auto from the opposite direction at Nikarighata. The miscreants shot at him from close range and fled in the same auto. Local TMC MLA Paresh Ram Das reached his home immediately after the attack. Muharram was known to be close to him. Das claimed that many people faced problems as Sheikh managed to stop tolabaji (extortion). “He was fearless in his fight against corruption. He paid the price for being upright against corruption,” Das said. The MLA claimed that the assailants will be identified and held soon. Canning TMC block president Saibal Lahiri said, “We expect the administration to investigate the case without bias and identify the culprits.” Bengal BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh blamed the death on internal Trinamool rivalry.

Chances of calling on Prime Minister Narendra Modi are also not ruled out as the CM wants to take up the issue of pending financial dues to the state as also the extension of BSF’s jurisdiction. Though Banerjee had written to Modi in October-end on the BSF issue, the Centre was yet to respond. The Bengal assembly had, meanwhile, moved a resolution against the Centre’s decision. The CM might speak to several opposition leaders on the BSF issue to forge a united stand in Parliament as Trinamool Congress had described the decision as an attack on the federal structure and usurping the powers of states. Trinamool leader in Lok Sabha Sudip Bandyopadhyay had said they would be making it an issue in Parliament. Sources hinted Banerjee might also meet a senior BJP leader who is likely to join Trinamool. Even a BSP leader might meet her, they said. During Banerjee’s last visit to Delhi in July, she had met several senior political leaders, including Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and PM Modi. This time too meetings with several Congress leaders, including Sonia, might happen. Banerjee had also raised the issue of the Centre creating a kitty from cess on petro products that she had wanted to be shared among the states. This too she might discuss with opposition leaders. The CM might meet leaders of the farmers’ agitation. She had congratulated protesting farmers after the PM declared the decsion to repeal three farm laws. After returning from Delhi, Banerjee may visit Mumbai to rope in investors for the Bengal Global Business Summit in early December. On that trip, she might meet NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. After returning to ofice for the third time in a row, Banerjee is focusing on industrialisation and employment generation, for which she might meet several industrialists, including Mukesh Ambani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mamata-set-for-4-day-delhi-trip-from-today/articleshow/87837311.cms||Debashis Konar

The conservative Muslim body, which exercises a crucial say in the affairs of the community, also sought “curbs against communal and hostile posts on social media and legal action against miscreants”. The demands are part of a resolution adopted at the two-day convention attended by around 200 AIMPLB members in Kanpur on Sunday. It has been highlighted in the resolution that “esteemed Hindu, Sikh and other non-Muslim scholars have consistently acknowledged the greatness of Prophet Muhammad. By the same token, in line with the teachings of Islam, Muslims too have shunned attributing any offensive word about respectable figures of other religions. It is, however, highly deplorable that of late some mischievous persons have openly insulted Prophet Muhammad whereas government has not taken any deterrent step in this regard.” The resolution emphasised that “this attitude of communal forces is totally unacceptable.” The AIMPLB demanded the government punish those guilty of showing disrespect to holy religious figures. “The government should enact effective legislation for tackling this issue,” said S Q R Ilyas, convener, Committee for Protection of Religious and Cultural Freedom and Personal Laws of AIMPLB. The resolution did not name any religious figure other than Prophet Muhammad. On the Uniform Civil Code, the conservative body said, “UCC is neither suitable nor useful for such a vast multi-religious country as India.” The AIMPLB also asserted that in the past few years “poisonous propaganda” has been carried out against Muslims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/aimplb-opposes-ucc-seeks-anti-blasphemy-law/articleshow/87838651.cms||Ambika Pandit

Fadnavis also took a dig on state women and child development minister Yashomati Thakur, the guardian minister of Amravati, for her reported silence on the November 12 violence, saying the state government has been talking only about next day’s unrest. Fadnavis also dared the Maha Vikas Aghadi leadership to ban Raza Academy, a Mumbai-based outfit that held a rally on November 12 against reported atrocities in the northeastern state of Tripura, leading to the violence in Amravati.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/stop-targeting-saffron-outfits-over-unrest-says-fadnavis/articleshow/87838671.cms||---

Two photographs of Prime Minister and Yogi Adityanath walking shoulder to shoulder went viral on social media, with the political circles seeing it as Modi’s yet another full throated endorsement of UP chief minister in the build up to the UP polls. The photographs, tweeted by the UP CM, were shared across saffron social media platforms, including of those who consider BJP to be too “lite” for their taste, came close on the heels of PM terming the Delhi-Lucknow saffron stewardship as “Karma Yogis ki sarkar”. हम निकल पड़े हैं प्रण करकेअपना तन-मन अर्पण करकेजिद है एक सूर्य उगाना हैअम्बर से ऊँचा जाना हैएक भारत नया बनाना है https://t.co/0uH4JDdPJE— Yogi Adityanath (@myogiadityanath) 1637477222000BJP sources said the PM’s reassuring hand on Yogi’s shoulder and the proximity captured in the two still shots were Modi's way of conveying to the larger audience that the UP CM has the central leadership's backing: an affirmation which becomes crucial on the eve of crucial task of ticket distribution of UP polls and of determing how much billing Adityanath will be given during the campaign. “Ham Nikal Pade Hai Pran Karke, Apna Tan Man Arpan Karke, Zid Hai Ek Surya Ugana Hai, Ambar Se Uncha Jaana Hai, Ek Bharat Naya Banana Hai (We have embarked on a journey, with a pledge, dedicating our mind and body, to make the sun rise; rise high above the sky and make a new India),” Adityanath posted the Hindi poem along with the two pictures. Modi, who reached Lucknow on Saturday, was on a two-day visit to the UP capital to attend the 56th DGP-IGP conference. Earlier this month, Yogi was the only CM invited physically to BJP’s national executive held in Delhi recently where he presented the party's political resolution, a privilege which used to be with party veterans like Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L K Advani. The picture shared by Yogi was a rare one, with party watchers unable to recall another instance of the PM being in such close proximity to a colleague . Senior leaders in the party maintained that Aditynath chose to tweet the photograhs to tell his colleagues as well as the audience beyond the saffron circles that he has the endorsement of party’s talismanic icon and they should aquiesce with the reality. While several leaders retweeted and reacted to the Modi-Yogi picture, BJP national vice president and incharge for UP Radha Mohan Singh wrote, “Strong leadership dedicated to building a new UP and a new India….” Asked about “relevance of the picture and how the party insiders see it, a senior BJP leader said, “It is open for the media to speculate.” Results of the UP polls will be crucial for the party in the 2024 general elections when Modi will be seeking a third term as PM. The BJP brass has made it clear that the party is going to seek a mandate for another term on its development agenda and the welfare schemes of the Centre.PM Modi, home minister Amit shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh have already visited UP multiple times and Modi recently inaugurated the first expressway in eastern UP, “Poorvanchal Expressway” connecting Lucknow to many districts including Sultanpur, Ayodhya, Azamgarh, Mau, Ghazipur and Ballia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/yogi-tweets-pics-with-modi-talks-of-making-new-india/articleshow/87838688.cms||Akhilesh Singh
---||World||US: 5 dead, more than 40 injured after vehicle plows through parade in Wisconsin||WAUKESHA: Five people were killed and more than 40 injured after an SUV sped through a Christmas parade in Waukesha, Wisconsin, on Sunday, knocking down dozens of people including youngsters waving pompoms and a group of "Dancing Grannies". "At this time, we can confirm that five people are deceased and over 40 are injured," the Waukesha Police Department said on its Facebook page. "However, these numbers may change as we collect additional information." Waukesha Police Chief Dan Thompson earlier told reporters that a person of interest was in custody and a vehicle had been recovered after the incident in the town, about 20 miles (32 km) west of Milwaukee. It was not known whether the incident was related to terrorism, but there was no further danger and an earlier shelter-in-place order in the town of around 72,000 had been lifted, Thompson said. A video posted online showed a red sport utility vehicle plowing at speed through the parade, appearing to run over more than a dozen people before crowds ran from sidewalks to offer assistance. Thompson said an officer fired shots at the vehicle in an attempt to stop the carnage. Another video on social media appeared to show police firing on the vehicle as it crashed through street barriers. Police did not believe shots had been fired from the vehicle, Thompson added, contrary to earlier reports. Belen Santamaria, her husband, and their three-year old daughter were planning to join the parade with their Catholic Church. But Santamaria, a 39-year old Mexican factory worker, woke up on Sunday with a backache, so the family watched the procession from the sidewalk instead. "The SUV came by at full speed," said Santamaria. "Then I started to hear people screaming." She hid in a restaurant with their daughter while her husband, 39-year old delivery worker Jesus Ochoa, ran ahead to try to help injured people. He said he heard through other members of their church that roughly 10 members of the congregation, mostly Latinos and both adults and children, are injured. "I was going to be there, walking," Santamaria said. "The SUV would have hit us too." Dance groups hitA woman told Milwaukee's Fox6 TV station that the SUV hit a dance team of girls between 9 and 15 years old. She said the immediate reaction was silence, followed by screaming, running and checking on those injured, Fox6 reported. Video on social media showed small groups surrounding injured girls with white pompoms scattered around. One witness said the driver also hit a group of "Dancing Grannies" and at least one person flipped over the hood of the SUV, according to Milwaukee's WISN-TV, an ABC affiliate. "Members of the group and volunteers were impacted and we are waiting for word on their conditions," the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies said on their Facebook page. "Please keep the Grannies, all those injured, and all those who witnessed this horrible event in your thoughts and prayers." The local CBS affiliate later showed a picture on Twitter of what appeared to be the red SUV involved with its hood crumpled and front fender hanging off, parked in a driveway. Another witness estimated the SUV was going about 40 mph (64 kph) when it hit the crowd parading down the street, the TV station said. "As we were walking back in between the buildings ... we saw an SUV cross over, just put the pedal to the metal and just zooming full speed along the parade route. And then we heard a loud bang, and just deafening cries and screams from people who are struck by the vehicle," Angelito Tenorio, an alderman in nearby West Allis, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Photos and videos of Waukesha circulating on Twitter showed police cars and ambulances crowding a street decked out with Christmas lights in the aftermath of the incident, which occurred around 4:39 p.m. (2239 GMT). People bundled up against the cold huddled on sidewalks as dusk fell. The Children's Wisconsin hospital said on Twitter it had received 15 patients as of 8 p.m., with no reported fatalities at that time. Schools would remain closed on Monday for grades 4K-12 and additional counselors would be available for students who may need support services, the district superintendent of schools said. In 2015, four people were killed and 46 injured in Stillwater, Oklahoma when a woman drove into a crowd watching the homecoming parade for a football team. A truck was deliberately driven into a Christmas market in Berlin, Germany in 2016, killing 12 people in an attack linked to Islamic State.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/suv-plows-into-wisconsin-christmas-parade-multiple-injuries/articleshow/87838720.cms||---

---||India||PM seeks adoption of future tech for grassroots policing||NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday called for setting up of a high-powered police technology mission led by the home minister, to adopt future technologies for fulfilling grassroot policing requirements. Addressing the valedictory session of the DGPs/IGPs conference organised by the intelligence bureau at Lucknow, Modi cited the example of platforms like CoWin, GeM and UPI to emphasise the importance of technology in improving the lives of general public. He suggested positive use of drone technology for the benefit of the people. The Prime Minister also suggested development of inter-operable technologies for the benefit of police forces across the country. Participating in wideranging discussions with the police chiefs on issues like terrorism, left-wing extremism, cyber-crimes, narcotics trafficking, prison reforms, NGO funding and drone threat etc, Modi called for analysis of all police-related incidents and developing them into case studies to make it an institutionalised lear ning mechanism. He appreciated the positive change in police attitude towards the general public, particularly post-Covid. Stressing on review of SMART policing concept introduced in 2014, Modi suggested development of a roadmap for its continuous transformation and institutionalisation of the same in the police forces. To tackle some of the routine challenges faced by police, he sought the involvement of highly-qualified youths to scout for technological solutions, through hackathons. The 56th police chiefs conference in Lucknow was attended by 62 DGP/IGP-level officers, including heads of the state and UT police as well as central police organisations and central armed police forces. More than 400 police officers of various ranks attended the conference virtually from IB offices across the country. The Prime Minister hailed the hybrid format of the conference as it allowed free-flow of information between various ranks. Modi on Sunday also awarded the President’s Police Medal for Distinguished Service to IB personnel. For the first time, as per the directives of the PM, IPS officers from various states had submitted articles on contemporary security issues, which added more value to the conference. The three-day conference was inaugurated by home minister Amit Shah on November 19. Shah was part of all the discussions and offered his suggestions and guidance, apart from awarding trophies for the threebest police stations of the country to the station house officers (SHOs) of Sadar Bazar PS in New Delhi, Gangapur PS in Ganjam district of Odisha and Bhattu Kalan PS in Fatehabad, Haryana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-seeks-adoption-of-future-tech-for-grassroots-policing/articleshow/87838752.cms||---
---||Noida||Why insolvency cases are giving Noida a tough time||GREATER NOIDA: It’s not just stalled housing projects, the two industrial authorities in Noida and Greater Noida are grappling with another problem — the complex insolvency resolution process. While the Greater Noida Authority (GNIDA) is dealing with 21 cases of insolvency proceedings before the National Company Law Tribunal and the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, the Noida Authority is party to 16 such resolution cases or appeals, at present. The outcome of these proceedings has a significant bearing on their financial health, which is the source of the anxiety for the development authorities struggling to recover dues from developers that run into thousands of crores. It was in August 2017 that the two authorities had their first brush with the bankruptcy code when the Allahabad bench of NCLT announced initiation of insolvency proceedings against Jaypee Infratech. But over the past four years, the legal cell of the authorities has failed to build a strong case before the tribunal and lost multiple appeals. The latest such appeal, on November 10, met with the same fate at the NCLAT. In that case pertaining to Apex Alphabet (formerly Misty Heights) in Techzone 4, the GNIDA had appealed against the NCLT order and put forth its claim as financial creditor before the resolution professional in February 2020. An operational creditor had initiated the insolvency proceedings against Maple Realcon Private Limited, the promoter of Apex, in July 2018. NCLAT dismissed Greater Noida’s appeal against the NCLT order, saying that it was too late to file the claim as a financial creditor despite being aware about the insolvency proceedings against the company. Senior lawyers said the insolvency and bankruptcy code was a law that required expertise to deal with. “Understanding all the nuances related to the bankruptcy code requires a lot of study. Plus, several amendments have been made over the years to cater to the evolving needs. Understanding jurisprudence on financial debt and the time value of money requires a lot of homework. The authorities need an independent view and handholding by industry experts to deal with this issue since it is a new subject for all of us,” said Aditya Parolia of PSP Legal. He clarified that the insolvency and bankruptcy code was not a framework designed to recover dues from a company. On April 16 this year, the Noida Authority appealed against the resolution proceedings of Shubhkamna Buildtech Pvt Ltd, a group that had floated a project in Sector 137. The appellate tribunal rejected its plea to be considered as financial creditor and refused to entertain the argument that its lease deed with Shubhkamna group should be treated as a financial document, observing these papers could not be categorised that way under the Indian Accounting Standards. Since then, Noida has been losing battles in insolvency resolution cases to be classified as the financial creditor rather than the operational creditor. A financial creditor has more rights in overall proceedings and has the authority to vote in the meeting of the committee of creditors. While the Noida Authority is in the process of selecting an expert agency that can guide the officials about the insolvency proceedings, GNIDA is yet to take any such step. Narendra Bhooshan, the CEO of GNIDA, said a detailed bid document had been floated already. “We have mentioned all our requirements in the proposal and have invited bids from legal experts. We have identified four areas where we need to focus and will shortlist the legal consultants accordingly,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/why-insolvency-cases-are-giving-noida-a-tough-time/articleshow/87837198.cms||Shalabh
---||Business||Focus on quality can fetch good prices for tea: ICRA||Kolkata: Focus on quality is likely to provide some support to declining tea prices even as producers feel the impact of sharp increase in wage rates, says rating agency Icra. Corroborating the Icra view, Tea Board chairman P K Bezboruah told TOI that all-or-no auction of tea, increase in mandatory tea waste percentage, zero plucking in December can improve both quality and price realisation of tea in India. In the recently released study on the ailing, labour-intensified agro industry sector, the investment information and credit rating agency has found that tea prices in the current year (2021) have declined after June as production has witnessed some recovery from the lows of last year, leading to an ease in the tightness in the supply-demand scenario, which had supported prices in 2020. “However, tea producers who are focused on producing quality teas are likely to witness a much lower decline this year. Prices of quality teas are ruling at a much firmer level than overall auction averages; quality producers are thus likely to witness a lower moderation, on a y-o-y basis, in financial performance than earlier envisaged,” the Icra study added. According to the Tea Board chairman, if an estate must sell 50% of its output via auction, a buyer should also be made legally bound to buy a minimum 50% of tea from the same. The buyers are weakening the benchmark price of tea in the government-run auction. “So, if the government makes it mandatory to sell 100% tea produce (except high-priced and export-quality Darjeeling tea) through auction routes, there will be little chance of any price moderation in private sales. Competition will be more,” explained Bezboruah. For the removal of sub-standard tea from the system, he prescribed that at least 2% of the leaves produced should be declared as ‘waste’ and plucking inferior quality tea in the month of December must be banned. The planters’ battle to make their businesses sustainable has become tougher following a considerable increase in cost of production with the hike in daily wages of the garden workers in Assam and West Bengal in the current calendar year. Kaushik Das of Icra said, “Notwithstanding the likely moderation in financial performance of key bulk tea producers in FY2022, it would still be substantially better than what they posted in FY2020. Average auction prices of teas manufactured from own garden leaves of the top 50 estates of Assam and Dooars have witnessed a decline of only ~8.5% against ~25% for the overall auction average during H1FY2022.” Average prices at NI auction centres, during H1FY2022, were down by ~Rs 60/kg (~23%) on a Y-o-Y basis. The price decline has however been most in the bought leaf segment, which was down by ~Rs 77/kg (~33%).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/focus-on-quality-can-fetch-good-prices-for-tea-icra/articleshow/87837171.cms||Sovon Manna

The PM is scheduled to participate in the foundation stone laying ceremony of the Noida International Airport at Jewar in GB Nagar. The airport is a key infrastructure project of the Yogi Adityanath government in the state, which will go to assembly elections in early 2022. Four helipads, nine parking spots, 30 gates and exhibition and VIP lounges have been set up for the event at Rohi village, expected to be attended by over three lakh people, officials said. “CM Yogi Adityanath will be visiting the ceremony’s site at Rohi village for an inspection on November 23. He is also scheduled to hold a meeting with officials regarding the preparations where he may issue further directives. We are making all preparations to hold a grand event where work is about 60% complete,” Arun Vir Singh, CEO YEIDA, told TOI on Sunday. During the visit, Singh said, the CM will be shown the design of the airport, hologram, exhibition gallery, master plan and exhibition lounge etc. “The public gathering will be held in a 2.5 lakh sqm (62 acres) area where a parking facility has been made in about 3 lakh sqm (74 acres). This will include the VIP and media parking as well as four helipads. While there will be 30 entry gates to the venue, the event management firm, Wizcraft, has prepared one main German hanger, exhibition lounge, along with VIP and media lounges,” Singh said. While officials expect about 1.25 lakh people to attend the foundation stone laying ceremony, Jewar MLA Dhirendra Singh maintained that over three lakh people would attend the event from GB Nagar and neighbouring districts of Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Mathura and Agra. “We will have a grand event with over 3 lakh people expected to attend the ceremony. This airport will be the largest in Asia and will change the dynamics of the region which had been languishing as backward and undeveloped as the project has been in the backburner for the past 20 years. Not only the youth from Jewar and GB Nagar, but those from north India will get employment opportunities with this airport and the development of the region,” the MLA said. Dhirendra Singh has been visiting villages around Jewar to motivate more people to attend thepublic meeting to be addressed by the PM. On Friday, state cabinet minister Jai Pratap Singh had visited the venue to check on the preparations underway at villages Ranhera and Rohi near the airport.

Irani was addressing a national workshop on child rights with emphasis on preventive aspects of child protection issues, organised by National Commission for Protection of Child Rights. She urged the participants of the workshop that while they look at challenges that emanate from poverty, “they should also look into abuse that happens in prosperous families, that happens in powerful organisations and in childcare institutions and how can we, not as administrators, but as citizens, find solutions”. Addressing the participants of the workshop, conducted under the aegis of 75 years of independence, the minister said: “On your shoulders rests the freedom of our future generation so that they may grow without fear, so that they may grow with confidence that if they seek justice, the justice will be delivered.” The minister also stressed on educating children about what is abuse.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/child-abuse-not-limited-to-poor-families-says-smriti-irani/articleshow/87838784.cms||---

Locals and family members later staged a protest and refused to cremate the body of the victim. The deceased was identified as Jaipal Singh, a resident of Muradnagar area. His son Anil said around 12 noon, Jaipal and his nephew Deepak had gone for the former’s check-up at a private hospital. On their way home, they stopped to buy some medicines. When they reached the pipeline road near the petrol pump, a dumper carrying soil rammed their bike. “My father was riding pillion. When the truck hit the bike, he fell on the road and came under its tyre. He died on the spot while Deepak was thrown into the air. Commuters and locals took him to a nearby hospital and informed police. His condition is still critical,” said Anil. The driver of the dumper fled the spot, he added. After the incident, Jaipal’s family members and some locals blocked the road for almost two hours and set fire to the dumper. “Police failed to arrest the accused. Despite the locals complaining several times that trucks and heavy vehicles drive at high speed here, not a single traffic cop was present on the road,” alleged Anil. SP (rural) Iraj Raja said on the basis of a complaint, an FIR was registered at Muradnagar police station against the driver under IPC sections 279 (rash driving), 304A (death due to negligence) and 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others). “Police are looking for the driver and checking details of the dumper,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/on-way-home-from-hosp-man-75-on-bike-hit-truck-dies/articleshow/87837258.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey

The interaction with MPs was part of a “virtual children’s parliament” convened by Parliamentarians’ Group for Children (PGC) in partnership with UNICEF. Children shared their anxieties and concerns in the presence of 35 MPs, including PGC Chairperson Gaurav Gogoi — Congress MP in Lok Sabha. PGC is a multiparty, non-statutory, selfconvened group of MPs who are interested in advancing child rights. It provides a platform for the MPs for cross-fertilization of ideas to discuss issues and ways to advance children’s rights. Suggestions ranged from state and Central-level policy initiatives to enable access to sustainable online education solutions to creating peer groups in schools to help in dealing with anxiety arising out of the pandemic and ensuring a more diverse curriculum in keeping with the National Education Policy 2020 to make education an empowering and interesting experience. Representing 1,500 children from 16 states, 14 children shared their experiences and presented a “Charter of Demands” to the PGC. The Charter focuses on safe school reopening as well as equitable access to online learning, reducing the size of the syllabus and prioritising vaccination for children. PGC chairperson said, “I want you to know that we have your best interests at heart”. One PGC convener, Heena Gavit, said the most urgent issue at hand is how to make up for the learning loss to prevent children, especially girls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bridge-covid-time-gaps-in-learning-kids-appeal-to-mps/articleshow/87838817.cms||Ambika Pandit
---||Hubballi||Karnataka rains: All major reservoirs are up to the brim||BENGALURU: Unusually heavy rain for November in Karnataka has heaped misery on farmers — they are certain to lose a substantial portion of their rabi crops — but it has brought cheer on another front: All 13 major dams are either full or near brimming. Four major dams have reached the 100%-mark and water is being released in a “controlled” manner. Karnataka State Natural Disaster Management Centre (KSNDMC) data shows Krishnarajasagar (KRS), Kabini, Bhadra and Tungabhadra dams were filled to capacity on Saturday. The other nine, which include three hydel energy reservoirs, are close to 90% full. Overall, Karnataka recorded 95% water storage in the Cauvery Basin and 92% in the Krishna Basin as on Sunday. While this is cause for cheer, there are also concerns that a heavy release of water, which is needed to ensure structural safety of the dams, could cause flooding downstream. However, officials have moved quickly to quell these fears, saying dam safety levels are well within parameters and flooding is unlikely. “As far as daily inflows and outflows are concerned, the inflows will taper down so we do not see any concerns of flooding,” said Manoj Rajan, KSNDMC commissioner. While insisting there is no threat of flooding, Tushar Girinath, principal secretary, revenue department, said “controlled” release of water from the dams is a local decision. “If we were in the middle of the monsoon season, then the concern of flooding would have been much higher.

The other big breach was in Sidlaghatta. Wherever there is a threat of water overflowing, the department fortifies the banks with sandbags.” JC Madhuswamy, minor irrigation minister, confirmed that there have been breaches, but said they were not serious and there is little to be worried about.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/karnataka-rains-all-major-reservoirs-are-up-to-the-brim/articleshow/87838826.cms||Sandeep Moudgal
---||Mysuru||Karnataka rains: All major reservoirs are up to the brim||BENGALURU: Unusually heavy rain for November in Karnataka has heaped misery on farmers — they are certain to lose a substantial portion of their rabi crops — but it has brought cheer on another front: All 13 major dams are either full or near brimming. Four major dams have reached the 100%-mark and water is being released in a “controlled” manner. Karnataka State Natural Disaster Management Centre (KSNDMC) data shows Krishnarajasagar (KRS), Kabini, Bhadra and Tungabhadra dams were filled to capacity on Saturday. The other nine, which include three hydel energy reservoirs, are close to 90% full. Overall, Karnataka recorded 95% water storage in the Cauvery Basin and 92% in the Krishna Basin as on Sunday. While this is cause for cheer, there are also concerns that a heavy release of water, which is needed to ensure structural safety of the dams, could cause flooding downstream. However, officials have moved quickly to quell these fears, saying dam safety levels are well within parameters and flooding is unlikely. “As far as daily inflows and outflows are concerned, the inflows will taper down so we do not see any concerns of flooding,” said Manoj Rajan, KSNDMC commissioner. While insisting there is no threat of flooding, Tushar Girinath, principal secretary, revenue department, said “controlled” release of water from the dams is a local decision. “If we were in the middle of the monsoon season, then the concern of flooding would have been much higher. But with the rains on its last legs, the likelihood of that happening is remote,” Girinath said.

Jagtar Singh Bajwa, spokesperson for Samyukta Kisan Morcha at the Ghazipur border, said, “The mahapanchayat in Lucknow on November 22 will be held as planned. Then, on the occasion of the completion of one year of the protest on November 26, farmers will congregate at Delhi’s borders,” he said. After that, the SKM will meet on November 27 at the Singhu border to discuss its strategy, Bajwa added. BKU leader Rakesh Tikait, meanwhile, tweeted, “The agricultural reforms being talked about by the government are fake. The plight of farmers is not going to change with them. The biggest reform will be to legislate MSP.” Farmers at UP Gate said they would not return home with mere announcements. Virender Singh, a farmer from Haryana, said, “The government should not think it has done us a favour. There is a need for a law on MSP. If that is not done, the protest will continue.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/expect-large-crowds-from-other-states-at-ghazipur-border/articleshow/87837277.cms||Aditya Dev
---||India||To execute sale deeds of 700 buyers, TN Rera appoints panel||NEW DELHI: In a landmark decision, the Tamil Nadu Real Estate Regulatory Authority (TNRERA) has appointed a committee of RERA officials to execute sale deeds for undivided share/plots in favour of the association of buyers of a stuck housing project in Coimbatore. The RERA authority will write to country planning department for permission; then the association will apply for registration with the RERA and the homebuyers' body will complete the project. While this order brings big relief to 700 homebuyers it has come at a time different RERA authorities are not enforcing the execution orders against builders despite their repeated failures to comply with orders. In this case, Sahara Housing Investors Association (SHIA), a home buyers’ body formed by aggrieved buyers who had invested in the Sahara City Homes, Coimbatore project from 2005 onwards had filed a complaint with the TNRERA against the Sahara Prime City Ltd in March 2019 about the stoppage of the project. The builder had promised to hand over possession of houses from 2011 onwards. The SHIA had also complained how the builder had not registered the project with RERA, which was a legal requirement. After multiple hearings the RERA passed order in favour of the buyers in January 2020. The builder had admitted they were in dire financial condition and inability to resume the remaining construction in the project The TNRERA had directed to execute the sale deed, for the undivided share/ plot in respect of allottees and conveying the common areas in favour of the association within three months and also imposed a Rs 1 crore penalty on the builder for non-registration of the project under the TNRERA. It had directed Director of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) to approve renewal or revised planning permission to the association since the earlier permission lapsed in September 2014. But since the builder failed to comply with the order within the stipulated time, the homebuyers’ association filed an Execution Petition (EP) with TNRERA in December last year. The RERA passed the order in favour of the homebuyers on November 18 (Thursday).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/to-execute-sale-deeds-of-700-buyers-tn-rera-appoints-panel/articleshow/87838829.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad: Private hospital faces probe for refusing to admit Covid patient||GHAZIABAD: The district health department will conduct an enquiry into the case of a private hospital denying admission to an older person on Friday after he was found Covid-positive in an antigen test conducted by the hospital. The person was later admitted to a hospital in Delhi where his RT-PCR test result turned out to be negative. “No hospital should deny admission to any patient. This matter will be investigated," Dr Sunil Tyagi, additional chief medical officer, said. "We will take up the matter on Monday when the office reopens." Joginder Singh Johar, a 77-year-old man who lives with his wife in a housing society in Raj Nagar Extension, developed a fever on Monday. A private doctor started treating Johar but on Friday evening, he fell due to dizziness and suffered an injury on his hip. Johar’s son-in-law, Damandeep Singh, who also lives in the society, took him to Sarvodaya Hospital in Kavi Nagar around 8pm, the same day. Subsequently, he was tested for Covid through an antigen kit and the result was 'positive'. Singh said, “The hospital management immediately asked us to take him away and admit him to some other hospital. I asked for his test report but we were only told that he had tested positive. When I insisted, the hospital threatened to throw us out." Singh took Johar to three more hospitals, but they also denied the latter admission. "I finally contacted Sir Ganga Ram Hospital and booked a hospital bed. We reached the Delhi hospital around 4am,” Singh added. Sarvodaya Hospital justified the move, saying that dengue patients are currently given priority and the hospital is not a dedicated Covid facility. “There are so many dengue patients in the hospital. Admitting a Covid patient would put a lot of restrictions on us. The administration should have a Covid facility for such patients. We have not received any letter from the health department. But we will give a reply when we get it,” said Neeraj Garg, medical superintendent of the hospital. Johar's Covid test, conducted at Gangaram Hospital, through the RT-PCR method, returned negative results on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/pvt-hosp-faces-probe-for-refusing-to-admit-patient-with-covid/articleshow/87837303.cms||Aditya Dev

Over three days, the ACB had conducted raids on BDA offices and claimed to have unearthed several shady land deals besides misappropriation of compensation funds for those who lost land. “In the interest of delivering services to the common man, the BDA needs a clean-up,” Bommai told reporters. When asked about the possibility of influential people being involved in the alleged corruption, Bommai said his government will not tolerate corruption in any form. He said he is awaiting a report from the ACB which will reveal the truth. “There is no question of shielding anyone who is found guilty,” he said. “We will take action against them, whoever they may be or how influential,” he said. Bommai said SR Vishwanath, BDA chairman, had drawn his attention to corruption within the agency and he had asked the urban development department to investigate complaints raised by people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bda-needs-a-clean-up-says-karnataka-cm-basavraj-bommai-on-raids/articleshow/87838937.cms||---
---||India||Made-in-India stealth fighter project set to take off in 2022||NEW DELHI: India is now finally getting set to launch its most ambitious indigenous military aviation project to build a fifth-generation fighter or the advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA) with advanced stealth features as well as 'supercruise' capabilities. The case for the full-scale engineering development of the twin-engine AMCA prototypes has been finalized and will be sent for approval to the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) by early next year after consultations between the defence and finance ministries, top sources said on Sunday. Production of fifth-generation jets is an extremely complex and expensive affair, with the American F/A-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning-II Joint Strike Fighter, the Chinese Chengdu J-20 and Russian Sukhoi-57 being the only operational ones around the globe at present. Experts, however, contend the J-20 and Sukhoi-57 fighters are still somewhat short of being true-blue fifth-generation fighters. The 36 Rafales being inducted by IAF, under the Rs 59,000 crore deal inked with France in September 2016, are 4.5-generation jets. As of now, the development cost of the 25-tonne AMCA is estimated to be around Rs 15,000 crore, with the first prototype’s “rollout” by 2025-26 and production of the Mark-1 jets slated to begin in 2030-31 under the “aggressive timelines” set by DRDO and its Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA). A more realistic timeframe for the AMCA induction to kick-off, however, would be around 2035. The AMCA project is critical for IAF, which is grappling with just 30-32 fighter squadrons and will not reach its sanctioned strength of 42 squadrons even with “planned inductions” over the next 10-15 years. The detailed AMCA designing, which was sanctioned in December 2018, meets IAF’s “preliminary staff qualitative requirements” but the requisite powerful engine remains a major problem. Consequently, the first two squadrons of AMCA Mark-1 will have the existing General Electric-414 afterburning turbofan engine in the 98 Kilonewton thrust class, while the next five mark-2 squadrons will have a more powerful 110 Kilonewton engine. "With the foreign collaborator to be selected by early-2022, the new engine will be concurrently developed indigenously,” said a source. The advanced stealth features in the swing-role AMCA will range from “serpentine air-intake” and an internal bay for smart weapons to radar absorbing materials and conformal antenna. The fighter will also have the supercruise capability to achieve supersonic cruise speeds without the use of afterburners as well as data fusion and multi-sensor integration with AESA (active electronically scanned array) radars. In the interim, IAF’s planned inductions include 73 Tejas Mark-1A fighters and 10 trainers, which will be delivered in the 2024-2028 timeframe under the Rs 46,898 crore deal inked with Hindustan Aeronautics in February this year. Then there is the long-pending “Make in India” project for 114 new 4.5-generation fighters with “some fifth-generation capabilities” for over Rs 1.25 lakh crore, which has seven foreign contenders and is likely to get the initial “acceptance of necessity” next year. There are some discussions also underway about whether India should leapfrog from the Tejas Mark-1A directly to the AMCA. “IAF will certainly require additional Tejas jets after the next 83 are delivered, whether they are enhanced variants of Mark-1A or Mark-2. Many technologies proven in their manufacture will be scaled up for AMCA,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/made-in-india-stealth-fighter-project-set-to-take-off-in-2022/articleshow/87838884.cms||Rajat Pandit
---||Chennai||Madras HC sets norms for advocates association office-bearers||CHENNAI: In an endeavour to restore the glory of the Madras high court advocates association (MHAA), one of the largest in the country, a division bench of the high court has fixed minimum qualifications for those wanting to contest for the posts of office bearers of the association.  Accordingly, a person willing to contest for the post of President of MHAA should be a senior counsel with a regular practice of at least 25 years and have argued 50 cases before the high court each year or 250 cases in the past five years. Similar qualifications have been fixed for other office bearers too. A division bench of Justice N Kirubakaran and Justice R Pongiappan passed the orders in response to a petition by MHAA member, K Sathyabal who raised a series of contentions with regards to the association and its functioning. The petitioner sought for the certificate of practice of the members has to be verified to check whether members are practicing in Madras high court and also contended that there is confusion with regard to membership as whether members are resident or non-residents of Chennai and without ascertaining the same, elections cannot be held. A E Chellaiah, chairman of the election committee submitted before the bench that they have taken earnest and meticulous efforts, verifying all records to prepare the voter list. In the process, 1000 members have already been eliminated, the chairman informed the court. In response, the petitioner made it clear that he did not want to defer the elections, but want it to be conducted after verification of all records. The bench noted that many persons who have not even entered the Madras high court campus are trying to become members and office bearers of the association. "Using this post, they indulge in katta panchayat (kangaroo court), bringing disrepute to the profession as well as the advocate association," the bench stated and also noted that since there is no qualification fixed for contesting elections, non-practicing advocates and advocates who have not even completed one year in the bar are contesting elections, and surprisingly getting elected too. Observing these, the division bench passed an order fixing minimum qualifications for various posts of the advocates association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/madras-hc-sets-norms-for-advocates-association-office-bearers/articleshow/87838975.cms||A Ragu Raman

Even before the latest killing and arrests, some of the CPI(Maoist) central committee members had either died or were apprehended during the course of the year. These include Ramakrishna alias Saket and Haribhushan, both of whom died earlier this year due to medical reasons, and BG Krishnamurthy who was recently arrested in Kerala. As per a senior IPS officer engaged in counter-Left wing extremism operations, with the death and arrests of key CPI(Maoist) leaders over the years, the “active” strength of the politburo, the highest decision-making body of the outfit, has shrunk to five and that of the central committee to 21. The CPI(Maoist) politburo now effectively has five seniormost leaders — N Keshava Rao alias Basavaraju who now leads the outfit; general secretary Mupalla Lakshamana Rao alias Ganapathy who is now relegated to more of a ‘mentoring’ role; Misir Besra who was once jailed but then freed in a daring jailbreak by his cadres; M Venugopal Rao; and Katakam Sudharshan, who is also in charge of ‘urban warfare’ operations of CPI(Maoist). The CPI(Maoist) central committee comprises 27 members, of which one was killed (Teltumbde), two died due to poor health (Ramakrishna and Haribhushan) and three were arrested this year (Kishen-da, Sheela Marandi and Krishnamurthy). Among the 27 central committee members, 12 hail from Telangana; four from Jharkhand; three each from Andhra Pradesh and Bihar; two each from West Bengal and Maharashtra; and one from Karnataka. “Not a single member is below the age of 50 years. As many as 60% of the members are aged between 50 and 60 years and 40% above 60 years. As for the younger leaders of CPI(Maoist) who may one day be promoted to the central committee, they have mostly risen from the soil and are largely from the Abujmarh area, with total entrenchment of CPI(Maoist) now limited to the area along Sukma-Bijapur border,” an officer who has been closely associated with anti-LWE operations told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/aging-maoist-leadership-takes-a-hit/articleshow/87838980.cms||Bharti Jain

A division bench of Justices S Vaidyanathan and G Jayachandran made the observations while disposing of a petition filed by K Mariammal seeking premature release of her husband K Moorthy, a life convict in a murder case jailed for 17 years. She stated that her husband was entitled to premature release according to the 2018 GO as the government had taken a policy decision to release prisoners based on their good conduct in connection with the birth centenary of former chief minister M G Ramachandran. However, the state submitted that Moorthy was found guilty of a major offence under section 302 (murder) of IPC and under sections of the Explosives Substances Act, which is a central Act. Due to Covid, cases could not be taken up for consideration by the advisory board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hc-premature-release-not-a-matter-of-right-for-convicts/articleshow/87838985.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The accused allegedly used counterfeit labels of top foreign companies and brands on the products, police said. Raw material worth Rs 2 crore and a machine used in the manufacture of the fake products have been seized, they added. According to police, the main accused, Anuj Kumar Singh (30), a resident of Varanasi, holds a biotechnology degree from a Chennai institute and had worked in some pharma company for six years before starting the unit to manufacture fake products. The two other accused have been identified as Anuj’s brother-in-law Preetam Kumar alias Golu (24), from Chandauli, and Bacchan Kumar (25), a native of Bulandshahr. Elamaran G, the ADCP of Greater Noida, said the police and drug inspection department received information about the factory and conducted a raid. “The three men were arrested from the spot. We also seized the raw materials, some sealed supplements, an XUV 500 and one scooter from their possession,” he said. Police said the men purchased raw materials from two men, Praveen Dhankad and Somveer Dhankad, from Rewari in Haryana. The two men are currently on the run. “The accused used to manufacture the fake products and used labels of leading foreign brands. The two suspects from Haryana used to help them in selling the products locally. They have been functioning in the area for the last six months,” ADCP said. Police said the suspects had no licence to manufacture health supplements and these products were harmful for consumption. A case has been registered against the five suspects under IPC Sections 274 (adulteration of drugs), 275 (sale of adulterated drugs), 420 (cheating), and 471 (using as genuine a forged document) and The Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/3-held-for-selling-fake-protein-supplements-with-labels-of-top-firms/articleshow/87837165.cms||---

The residents claim that their repeated complaints of poor waste management have failed to draw the attention of the civic body. While MCG’s sanitation workers occasionally come for the cleaning of the area, the residents claim, the civic staff hardly make any effort to lift the horticulture waste and instead pass the responsibility to other departments. Vanita Pasricha, a resident of Sushant Lok-1’s C Block, said, "We have been constantly reaching out to the MCG to get the horticulture waste lifted for the past few months but our requests have so far fallen on deaf ears. These people are passing the buck on other departments." The residents say that such heaps of horticulture waste lying unattended in the block are not only an eyesore but also a breeding ground for mosquitoes. Moreover, they fear that such waste accumulated on a daily basis could result in a fire someday. "Most of the households in our colony have gardens which generate huge horticulture waste. Moreover, there are several parks and trees in Sushant Lok-1, but there is no mechanism to deal with the horticulture waste. The civic body needs to set up a system to address this problem soon," Sudha Tiwari said. When contacted, a senior MCG official said they have 4-5 dedicated places where horticulture waste is being processed. "We haven’t yet received any complaint from Sushant Lok-1. I will ask officials to do the needful."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/mounds-of-trash-at-parks-roads-and-vacant-plots-nobody-to-lift-sushant-lok-1-residents/articleshow/87837485.cms||Akanksha Gupta

Anurag Singh, a 30-year-old balloon vendor, was returning from Rishikesh, where he works, to his home in Bijnor, when he passed the Chilla area of Rajaji Tiger Reserve on Thursday. It was evening, the Ganga and the forest looked beautiful and being a photography enthusiast, he stopthe team that eventually rescued Singh, told TOI, “As soon as he jumped into the water, he found a log and clung to it. He ended up on a patch of forest land surrounded by water.” Fortunately for him, the bag he was carrying was waterproof and had matches in it. He stopped his bike and took out his phone to take a selfie with the river as the backdrop. This is when a leopard emerged from the bushes and pounced at him. Fearing for his life, Singh quickly jumped into the river. Recounting what happened next, Pradeep Rawat, a police official who was part of Cops saw smoke from fire, rescued Singh Anurag Singh’s bag was waterproof and had matches inside. He lit a bonfire to keep himself warm and then climbed a tree to avoid wild animals. After spending the night on top of the tree, he ventured into the nearby forest the next morning, hoping to find a way to human habitation. “He told us that he kept walking inside the jungle throughout the day but couldn’t find a way out. Eventually, he spent another night in the forest, lighting a bonfire and sleeping on top of a tree,” Rawat, who is in charge of the Saptrishi chowki at Haridwar, said. Singh resumed walking through the forest the next day on Saturday and ended up in a stretch of the forest opposite Shadani Ghat in Haridwar. He again lit up a fire in order to warm himself and also hoping that somebody would notice the smoke and reach out to him. This time, he got lucky as the smoke from the fire was spotted by police. “We went on a raft to the area from where the smoke was coming and saw him waving hysterically, asking to be rescued,” Rawat said. “He was shivering and hungry when Jal Police got him. We helped him change his clothes and have some food,” Rawat said, adding that Singh was “badly shaken by the ordeal but otherwise safe and sound, and was sent back to his home in Bijnor.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rajaji-sees-real-life-man-vs-wild-for-2-nights/articleshow/87839027.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: No footpaths for pedestrians to walk along highway, DLF-1 residents fume||GURUGRAM: Notwithstanding crores being spent by various government agencies every year on augmenting the city’s road infrastructure, walking on pavements continues to be a challenge for Gurugrammers. The residents of DLF-1, for instance, claim they hardly find a continuous, barrier-free stretch of pavement between gates numbers 4 and 6 of block A, B and C along the Gurugram-Faridabad highway. The reason: the fencing of the berm with metal nets and blade wires, which forces the residents of the township to walk on the roads braving the high-speed vehicles on the highway. Rahul Chandola, RWA president of Block H, said, "Fencing the pavement for the sake of aesthetics has been serving no purpose, instead putting the lives of pedestrians at great risk. We have been urging the authorities to provide us with a proper walkaway on this stretch, considering the number of people who walk either to the Qutab Plaza market or Bristol Chowk and Sikanderpur metro station daily." Residents have already approached the local councillor and the government officials and urged them to remove the encroachments at the earliest. They have also demanded footpaths on both sides of the highway between Kushboo Chowk and Bristol Chowk. "When there is already a green belt along the very same road, why eat up the space which is meant for pedestrians? How can the authorities allow such encroachments for landscaping and that too along a high-speed corridor like the Gurugram-Faridabad highway?" said Ritika Ratna, RWA joint secretary of the block. When contacted, Sandeep Singh, the executive engineer of PWD, said that some residents of the area had approached the department for creating a green belt on the roadside berm. "We allowed them. But if the residents are raising objections, we have no problem getting the same removed from the berms. I will look into the complaints of the DLF-1 residents," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/no-footpaths-for-pedestrians-to-walk-along-highway-dlf-1-residents-fume/articleshow/87837515.cms||Akanksha Gupta
---||Gurgaon||Haryana: Nuh to get six new primary healthcare centres||GURUGRAM: To strengthen the primary health care in Nuh, the health department on Sunday directed the district to set up six new primary healthcare centres (PHCs) at the earliest. Nuh currently has 18 urban primary healthcare centres (PHCs) and 4 community health centres (CHCs). The new PHCs will be set up in Sakra, Uleta, Badarpur, Rawli, Malab and Seelkho. These centres will have three rooms and will provide OPD and immunisation facilities. Rajeev Arora, ACS(health), has directed the district to set up the facilities to provide benefits to people living in these areas. “The remote areas need these centres as people do not have access to health care facilities,” DB Saharan, director (retd) health services, Haryana. Officials said, these primary health centres are the backbone of the system. Apart from OPD services, they also provide dental services, treatment for dietetics and other diseases. The centres also provide counselling for family planning to residents. The doctors and staff of PHCs are also conducting Covid tests and contact tracing. They are also responsible for evaluating the condition of home isolation patients and keep a tab on their oxygen saturation levels. Last month, Haryana government had announced that in the next five years, the state will have 194 urban health and wellness centres, 22 integrated public health labs and critical care units each, as many as 17 units of 50-bedded in district hospitals and five 50-bedded units in govt medical colleges, as per the Pradhan Mantri - Atmanirbhar Swasth Bharat Yojana (PMASBY). A total of Rs 1,048.84 crore has been sanctioned for Haryana for the next five years. The PMASBY aims to strengthen health centres, especially in urban areas, by providing universal access to basic diagnostic and treatment services. It will focus on slum and slum like areas. These urban HWCs will provide health promotion, preventive services plus healthcare services, free medical consultation, free drugs, free diagnostics as well as outreach to the community for public health activities (e.g for Immunisation, TB, Malaria/ Dengue prevention etc). The objective of the PMASBY scheme is to fill critical gaps in health infrastructure, surveillance, and health research in both urban and rural areas so communities are equipped in managing pandemics or other public health crises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/nuh-to-get-six-new-phcs/articleshow/87837520.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Business||No exception from ownership norms for PSBs on selloff list||NEW DELHI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is unlikely to make an exception for ownership changes to privatise state-run banks. Instead, it will issue comprehensive guidelines that will also deal with corporate ownership of Indian lenders. Sources told TOI that the RBI will soon start the process of new norms, but it is yet to take a decision on allowing corporate houses into the banking business amid sharp divisions on the issue. The current norms do not allow corporate houses to enter the arena, although several large business houses such as the Birlas and the Tatas have a large financial services presence and may be interested in either acquiring a stake or setting up a bank in future. An internal working group set up by the RBI had submitted a new licensing policy for banks several months ago but the regulator is yet to take a call on the issue, given that it has received multiple inputs from stakeholders and it has been caught up with combating the impact of Covid on the economy. The Centre and the RBI have agreed on the legislative amendments that may be required to pave the way for privatisation of banks, for which three candidates have been identified. First off the block is expected to be IDBI Bank, whose name has been made public, with Indian Overseas Bank and Central Bank of India the other candidates in the pipeline, which have been shortlisted by the Niti Aayog with the final decision to be taken by a core group of secretaries. IDBI Bank was on the sell-off list for the current financial year along with a state-run insurance company and two public sector banks. But all the four transactions are not possible until the next financial year. The law to allow for privatisation of a general insurer has been cleared by Parliament but Dipam is yet to make much headway. And, in the absence of a road map for shareholding in banks, the IDBI Bank sale is not expected anytime soon as bidders would want to know the eligibility conditions and how much they can buy and how they need to dilute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/no-exception-from-ownership-norms-for-psbs-on-selloff-list/articleshow/87839089.cms||Sidhartha

The residents alleged that the society does not have permanent electricity connection as a result they have been facing frequent power cuts and voltage fluctuation. The protesters, holding banners and posters and shouting slogan against the developer, carried out a march inside the society to highlight the plight of the residents on Sunday. However, the developer refuted the allegations made by the residents and said that they are already working to resolve the issue. “We fail to understand the reason for creating such unrest, when we have already arrived upon a detailed written agreement with the RWA. Just 10 days ago, we signed this said agreement with the RWA addressing all their concerns and documented all the pending tasks with completion timeline, including electricity infrastructure, club etc. Our team has been proactively addressing all their grievances so such undue pressures should be avoided,” said Rohit Mohan, senior vice-president (marketing) BPTP Ltd. Spread across 102 acres of land, the township was launched in 2011, while the possession was started in 2017. At present more than 400 families are living here.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/builder-failed-to-fulfil-promise-say-astaire-garden-residents/articleshow/87837521.cms||---

---||Chennai||Chennai: Debris, poor upkeep mar parks||CHENNAI: There has been very little rainfall in the last two days but most parks in the city have been out of bounds for local residents due to lack of maintenance and debris. Water logging, fallen trees, broken equipment and shoddy maintenance is a common sight at Nageswara Rao park in Mandaveli, Independence Day park in Nungambakkam and Sivan Park in K K Nagar. Instead of cleaning up the parks after the wet spell and opening them, contractors who take care of the public facilities have locked them up. Some of these parks are maintained by residential welfare associations, corporates and non-profit organisations. As per the Greater Chennai Corporation, there are 702 parks in the city, out of which only 54 are maintained by them. About 554 parks were outsourced to contractors in 2019 and the civic body had claimed to have earned 1 cr in revenue from playfields alone after this. The remaining are maintained by contractors and residential welfare associations. "In the southern region, out of the 330 parks, 323 are open. Only seven have been closed due to water stagnation and tree fall problems. This will be cleared and oepned to public on Monday. Only two in central region have been closed," said an official. However, in reality, several parks are not open for public. Rekha S, a resident of K K Nagar, said she visited Sivan park twice in the last two days. "They didn't allow us inside. The watchman said they were yet to clear tree debris... they were worried that some branches could fall on walkers," she said. Another common problem at most parks is the stench that emanates due to lack of maintenance of toilets after the rain. At Nageswara Rao park, due to water stagnation, the stench from toilets is unbearable, said a local resident. The park maintenance contract was given in 2019 to a single contractor for a period of five years. There were a lot of issues with the way the tender was awarded and the manner of functioning of these parks under contractors. Though they were supposed to appoint three sweepers, two watchmen and other staff, in most parks, this has not been done. "That was one of the reasons why more residents were requested to come forward to adopt parks. We had received many applications but then the pandemic struck. We will look into this," said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-debris-poor-upkeep-mar-parks/articleshow/87839110.cms||Komal Gautham
---||Business||Developed nations want to expand WTO agenda||NEW DELHI: In the run-up to the WTO ministerial meeting later this month, developed countries led by the European Union and the US are seeking to expand the issues on the table to include reforms in the basic structure of the global trade body as well as sustainability, micro, small & medium enterprises (MSMEs) and gender issues in what is seen as an attempt to mount pressure on developing countries such as India to make trade-offs. At the same time, they are seeking to defer a decision on public stockholding for foodgrains — crucial for India’s procurement programme — by at least two years and have so far not agreed on waiver of intellectual property rights for Covid vaccines and medicines. “They are seeking to get us to agree on an agreement on fisheries without addressing our concerns over our fisherfolk. This government has stood its ground at the WTO, G20 and COP26 talks,” said a high-ranking official. Sources in Geneva as well as some of the trade experts said that EU, along with Brazil, and possibly the US, will push a document on reforms at WTO, which will seek dispute monitoring and a reform to the special and differential treatment along with things like an end to the system of consensus and inclusion of issues that are currently plurilaterals — areas which have been ‘no go’ in the past for India and other developing countries. Already, India is opposing such moves, arguing that negotiations on issues such as investment facilitation or domestic regulation of services have not been agreed to by all the members of WTO and there is no legal basis for it. In case of areas such as MSMEs, women empowerment and environment, the proponents such as the EU are not seeking binding commitments from the WTO membership. But the fear is that inclusion of these issues in the WTO declaration will open the doors for them being brought into the framework after a few years. What is coming as a setback for the developing countries is that the developed countries are blocking any deal on patents waiver to provide vaccines to the poor countries. At the same time, they are pushing for a package on trade and Covid, which is seen to be an attempt by the developed countries to ensure uninterrupted supplies and secure market access.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/developed-nations-want-to-expand-wto-agenda/articleshow/87839144.cms||Sidhartha
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh ATS nabs 2 from West Bengal for aiding Rohingyas||LUCKNOW: Two Myanmar natives, Noor Alam and Mohammad Jameel, were nabbed by the UP anti-terrorist squad from West Bengal on Sunday for facilitating illegal entry of Bangladeshis and Rohingyas into India and churning out fake Indian passports with Hindu identities and then sending them abroad. The duo was arrested after obtaining an arrest warrant from a special court in Lucknow. “Jameel was first nabbed and then his relative, Noor Amin, who was illegally residing with a Hindu name, Sudeep Maiti. Fake documents were seized from their possession,” said inspector general of police, ATS, Gajendra Kumar Goswamy, who added the duo was nabbed on basis of clues provided by four other arrested scamsters, Mithun Mandal, Shaon Ahmed, Mominur Islam and Mahendi Hasan. The first arrests were made on October 26. “During probe, it surfaced that Ratan Mandal, brother of accused Mithun Mandal, who operates a travel agency, European Tour and Travel, in Bardhaman district of West Bengal was involved in sending Bangladeshis and Rohingyas abroad on fake documents after smuggling them into India. He was aided by a Rohingya national, Mohammed Jameel, who would forge documents for Rohingya Muslims in Hindu names,” said Goswamy. An ATS official said, the duo had sent scores of Bangladeshis and Rohingyas to different countries on Indian identities. “They were sent to countries in West Asia, South Africa and Congo,” said an ATS official privy to the probe. Later, the accused would blackmail them and extort money with threats of leaking their real identities to Indian authorities, the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-ats-nabs-2-from-west-bengal-for-aiding-rohingyas/articleshow/87839018.cms||---
---||Business||Man-made fibre, yarn to incur 12% GST from Jan 1||NEW DELHI: The finance ministry has notified a uniform 12% GST rate on manmade fibre (MMF), yarn, fabrics and apparel, thereby addressing the inverted tax structure in the MMF textile value chain. Currently, tax rate on MMF, MMF yarn and MMF fabrics is 18%, 12% and 5%, respectively. The taxation of inputs at higher rates than finished products created build-up of credits and cascading costs. It further led to accumulation of taxes at various stages of the MMF value chain and blockage of crucial working capital for the industry. The GST Council, chaired by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and comprising state FMs, had in its previous meeting on September 17 decided that the inverted duty anomalies in the textile sector would be corrected from January 1, 2022. Giving effect to this decision, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) on November 18 notified 12% GST rate for MMF, MMF yarn and MMF fabrics. Experts said though there is a provision in GST law to claim the unutilised Input Tax Credit (ITC) as a refund, there were other complications and resulted in more compliance burden. The inverted tax structure caused an effective increase in the rate of taxation of the sector. The world textiles trade has been moving towards MMF but India was not able to take advantage of the trend as its MMF segment was throttled by the inverted tax regime, they said, adding the correction in duty anomaly will help the segment grow and emerge as a big job provider. EY tax partner Bipin Sapra said the rate changes in the textile industry is the first of the changes promised by the GST Council with an aim to rectify inverted duty structure and bring an efficient tax structure for a given sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/man-made-fibre-yarn-to-incur-12-gst-from-jan-1/articleshow/87839174.cms||---

Shiba Inu, for instance, cost just $0.00004893 or so each on Friday afternoon. The likely explanations for this are a mix of understandable, and befuddling. Retail traders love penny stocks. It’s easy to dream of huge returns when a move from 1 cent to 2 cents doubles your money. So going even smaller than that rides on some long-standing coattails, even if cryptocurrencies Shiba Ibu and Dogecoin don’t bring much else to the table. “You see, with a lot of these meme coins, such as Doge and Shiba, retail investors are ploughing money into them because they look cheap,” said Halsey Minor, executive chairman of Public Mint, a blockchain platform. “There’s a psychological element here, in many cases, where people think, ‘Oh, a whole Bitcoin is $65,000, but one Dogecoin is only 25 cents’.” But the rationale for such tiny slivers of Bitcoin, Ether or Ether’s cousins (smart contracts using the ERC20 standard that also live on Ethereum blockchain) is harder to explain. Why on earth would anyone need to divide a token up to 18 decimals? (See graphic.) Well, there are not many compelling reasons. Though, theoretically, a token could rise so much in value that all those decimal places could come in handy. In theory, at least. “18 decimals is a LOT of precision for pretty much any use case,” said Arjun Bhuptani, the co-founder and project lead of Connext, which is what’s known as an interoperability network that enables communication between Ethereum-compatibleblockchains. “The tradeoff that token creators typically consider when doing this is whether the improvement in user experience outweighs the additional work that would need to happen for other projects and applications to integrate it,” Bhuptani said. The result is what’s known as decimal precision — or how far to the right of the decimal point that various platforms are willing to go. For example, at Kraken, there are limits on how many numbers can be inputted when placing a trade. Given its high price, the exchange has done away with pennies when it comes to buying Bitcoin — orders can only be placed in dime increments. And when it comes to placing an order for a certain amount of a token, forget about an18-decimal standard for Ethereum-based tokens: You only get 8 on Kraken and many other platforms. As Kraken explains on its website: “A lower price precision can help order books operate more efficiently by reducing the volume of cancelled (unfilled) orders as traders continually jump in front of each other by small fractions in price.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/0-00005-coin-reveals-cryptos-wild-decimals/articleshow/87839217.cms||---

From November 15 to 19, the city recorded AQIs of 332, 369, 344, 323, 324, respectively. The highest pollution levels were recorded at Teri Gram, where the AQI was 377. This was followed by Vikas Sadan with an AQI of 370, Sector 51 with an AQI of 346 and Gwal Pahari with the lowest AQI of 335. At all four pollution monitoring stations, the PM2.5 and PM10 levels were higher than the permissible limits of 60 and 100 micrograms per cubic metres, respectively. Teri Gram, Vikas Sadan, Sector 51 and Gwal Pahari recorded PM2.5 levels of 375, 374, 362 and 343 micrograms per cubic metres, respectively. Meanwhile, Sector 51 recorded the highest PM10 level of 296 micrograms per cubic metres, followed by Teri Gram and Gwal Pahari with PM10 levels of 281 and 223, respectively. The data for Vikas Sadan was not available. Last year, the city AQI was also in the ‘poor' category during this time, according to data available with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). According to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Gurugram recorded a minimum temperature of 10.6 degrees Celsius and a maximum temperature of 24.4 degrees Celsius on Sunday. The low temperatures continue to prevent the dispersal of pollutants closer to the ground, said air quality experts. According to Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), winds picked up speed on Sunday and pollutants may get dispersed soon. “The meteorological conditions are unfavourable at the moment but the wind speed is increasing, which is a good sign. However, pollutant dispersion is taking time as the region is witnessing a dip in temperatures,” said Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, HSPCB. Not just Gurugram, neighbouring cities such as Faridabad, Delhi, Noida and Ghaziabad also recorded ‘very poor’ air quality on Sunday, with AQIs of 377, 349, 322 and 319, respectively. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the contribution of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 increased from 5% on Saturday to 8% on Sunday. In Delhi, the wind speed remained better during the entire day compared with the past few days. VK Soni, head, environment and research centre, IMD, said, “Unlike the past few days, when the wind speed normally went down to nil in the evening, it was recorded at up to 6kmph at Safdarjung at 7pm, allowing dispersal of pollutants. As strong winds are expected for the next two days, significant improvement in air quality is predicted on Monday and Tuesday.” IMD’s forecast shows that strong surface winds at the speed of 20-30 kmph are likely on Monday. Experts said after some providing relief to residents on Monday and Tuesday, the air quality is likely to start deteriorating from November 24 as wind speed is predicted to slow down. Over the past few weeks, residents have been reporting burning sensations in the eyes and breathing troubles because of pollutants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/air-quality-still-very-poor-but-winds-may-bring-relief/articleshow/87837585.cms||Ipsita Pati

In fact, owing to low turnout, the rate in November so far is 50% less than that of September, leaving health officers worried because with the current pace, the target of fully vaccinating the entire adult population of the district by December end or January first week will be delayed by four months. The state capital witnessed steady increase in daily vaccinations since the roll out in January till September. On an average 38,018 people took the jab every day in September, which declined to 22,336 in October and November has witnessed an average 15,600 inoculations per day so far. Lucknow’s adult population is 37.4 lakh. Of these, 17 lakh (45%) people have been fully vaccinated with two doses so far, while 15.3 lakh (41%) people have received a shot and are waiting for the gap period to be over to get the second. About 3.1 lakh (8.2%) individuals have not received any dose so far. This means the health department still has to administer 22 lakh more doses – 15.3 lakh for those who are waiting for a second dose and 6.2 lakh who have not taken any dose - to cover everyone with the two-dose course. With the current pace of vaccination, it will take at least 140 days (till April first week) to fully vaccinate every adult with the two-dose course. Earlier, based on September’s rate, the estimate was that this target will be achieved by January first week. District Immunization Officer Dr MK Singh said, “We are witnessing stagnation after covering such a large number of people. Those who have taken the first dose will take the second after the gap period of 12-16 weeks between two shots. However, the matter of concern is the number which has not come forward to take any dose. These people, it seems, are those who either have health issues or have hesitancy for some reason or another.” “We will start a door-todoor campaign, particularly in rural areas, soon to dispel myths and administer shots to those who have been left out so far,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-vaccination-pace-slow-in-lucknow-100-target-could-stretch-till-april-next-year/articleshow/87839064.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Delhi||Delhi HC says maintenance law loopholes letting offenders get away||NEW DELHI: Delhi high court has voiced concern over "legal loopholes" in the maintenance law letting "offending parties to slip away". While trying to plug the loophole in one case, the court set aside an order directing payment of maintenance by a man to his 'wife' after it was found that both the parties had other living spouses. Justice Subramonium Prasad, who was dealing with the plea challenging the trial court order directing payment of maintenance under Section 125 Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), pointed out that it is constrained to deny her maintenance since there is already a marriage still in existence between her and former husband. The court stated that in spite of the parties cohabitation as husband and wife, it is "not legally tenable to raise a presumption of a valid marriage" because both of them were already married to their respective spouses and their marriages were subsisting. Section 125 CrPC makes it clear if any person having sufficient means neglects or refuses to maintain his wife, who is unable to maintain herself, the trial court may order such person to make a monthly allowance for her maintenance. But the court underlined that the term "wife" under Section 125 CrPC does not envisage a situation wherein both the parties in the alleged marriage have living spouses. It added that in spite of the social justice factor embedded in the section, its objective is defeated as it fails to arrest the exploitation, which it seeks to curb. "This court finds it unfortunate that many women, especially those belonging to the poorer strata of society, are routinely exploited in this manner, and that legal loopholes allow the offending parties to slip away unscathed," the court observed.  It clarified that the woman, however, is free to avail other remedies under the Domestic Violence Act. The court was dealing with a case where the parties were married to their respective spouses but began cohabiting together. In September 2011, the woman filed a plea seeking maintenance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-hc-says-maintenance-law-loopholes-letting-offenders-get-away/articleshow/87839239.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: As namaz sites shrink, Waqf land may not hold answers||GURUGRAM: Following weeks of protests over namaz in the open that subsequently saw the number of designated sites reduced to almost half, members of the Muslim community have complained they do not enough space to offer Friday prayers. According to Waqf Board land records, there are 22 identified mosque sites in the city. Three of them — at Sadar Bazar, Sector 57 and Pataudi Chowk — don’t fall under Waqf control but are functional and can accommodate 300 people. Apart from these, there are around five smaller mosques in rural areas that can accommodate 50-60 people each. The 19 that are under Waqf control are either in a shambles or encroached. Most of the sites that are overrun by squatters are situated deep inside narrow labyrinths in congested areas like Jharsa, Wazirabad, Carterpuri and Badshapur, in places that are often difficult to locate. “The issue is not just about a few people creating disruptions. It’s about the lack of space and areas designated to offer prayers. There’s no point in fighting over old mosques that are encroached as those areas are very congested and even if we get those, it won’t be enough. The Waqf Board has failed to establish sufficient religious sites for the community,” said Khurshid Rajaka of Muslim Rashtriya Manch. The Waqf Board said it had raised the issue of encroachment in 2018 but no action was taken. It added that lack of space is an issue mainly in new Gurugram, not in the old city. “We request the government to provide us with land in new Gurugram that can be designated for religious activities. The administration can also consider asking factories in industrial areas like Udyog Vihar, Sector 37 and Manesar to create space in their premises for Muslim workers to offer namaz. This will largely solve the problem that we are seeing now,” said Haryana Waqf Board estate officer Jamaluddin. At some of the Waqf board sites, locals said they had no knowledge about any mosque. There are two mosques in the Badshapur area, according to the Waqf Board. Both have been encroached. At Jharsa, there are two mosques, one of which is in a dilapidated state and its corridors have been encroached. A villager said: “There is no religious land in this area that belongs to Muslims.” After the protests, some members of the Muslim community said they have decided not to offer prayers in the open. “I don’t want to get involved in any conflict and want to offer prayers peacefully. I used to go to Sector 49 earlier, but I’ve been told that the site has been closed now,” said Safi-uz-Zama (35), as he noted down the timings of namaz at a mosque in Sector 57. Deputy commissioner Yash Garg said no complaint has been received yet from the Waqf Board. “In case they think their religious sites are encroached, they should approach us with the lists of those areas. We will provide all the support they need,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/as-namaz-sites-shrink-waqf-land-may-not-hold-answers/articleshow/87837607.cms||Siddharth Tiwari
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Amid enrolment spike, classes in 2 shifts in Sanskriti schools?||GURUGRAM: The state education department has proposed classes in two shifts in Model Sanskriti Schools, where enrolment has increased in the current academic session, so that Covid norms are followed on campuses. According to the education department, the enrolment has increased by over 28% in the 137 government-run Model Sanskriti senior secondary schools and nearly 17% in the 1,418 Model Sanskriti primary schools. “The enrolment in all schools has shot up dramatically. We have recorded nearly 37,000 new admissions," said a senior official with the education department. The department plans to run the schools in total capacity from December 1. However, the present infrastructure in the schools is incapable of accommodating all the children amid the pandemic, compelling the department to propose two-shift classes. "While it (increase in enrolment) is good news, it has brought forward the challenge of accommodating these many children following Covid norms. It is practically impossible to expand the physical infrastructure in such a short time,” he added. The department has now written to the Central Board of Secondary Education about its proposal. After receiving a response from the board, the department would allow schools to move forward with classes in two shifts. The department also has decided to waive off school fees for students from BPL families.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/amid-enrolment-spike-classes-in-2-shifts-in-sanskriti-schools/articleshow/87837613.cms||Siddharth Tiwari
---||Delhi||Delhi: Court pulls up cops for 2 chargesheets in rape case||NEW DELHI: A city court has pulled up Delhi Police for filing two distinct chargesheets in a rape case, one given to the accused's counsel and the court and the other to the public prosecutor and the survivor's family. Additional Sessions Judge Gaurav Rao, in an order on November 17, said the court was leaving it to the police chief to decide on the action to be taken against the erring officials. The DCP concerned had submitted that the chargesheet before correction was also in the police file, which was inadvertently given to the complainant, and this mistake happened without any mala fide intention. However, the judge noted that both sets bore the signatures of the officials concerned on the same date. "I am not inclined to believe that, on the same day, the chargesheet was corrected/amended and signed and both sets of chargesheets were filed in the court. Moreover, the soft copy/ CD/ e-challan is different from the chargesheet/ hard copy filed in the court," the judge said. The court said what the DCP had failed to explain was the omission of two complete paragraphs running into 20-25 lines from the chargesheet, which were giving a clean chit to the accused and fixing the responsibility of another individual, whose name was omitted from the chargesheet filed in the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-court-pulls-up-cops-for-2-chargesheets-in-rape-case/articleshow/87839278.cms||---

"However, he took her to a coaching centre and showed her some photographs on his mobile phone and introduced himself as a cop," an officer said. Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Shankar Chaudhary said Kumar assured her of a job as a teacher in the coaching centre.  "Thereafter he took her to a park and raped her," Chaudhary said. Meanwhile, the girl's parents also approached police with a missing complaint and a case of kidnapping was registered.

---||World||El Salvador to build cryptocurrency-fuelled ‘Bitcoin City’||LA LIBERTAD: In a rock concertlike atmosphere, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele announced that his government will build an oceanside “Bitcoin City” at the base of a volcano. Bukele used a gathering of Bitcoin enthusiasts on Saturday night to launch his latest idea, much as he used a an earlier Bitcoin conference in Miami to announce in a video message that El Salvador would be the first country to make the cryptocurrency legal tender, A bond offering would happen in 2022 entirely in Bitcoin, Bukele said. And 60 days after financing was ready, construction would begin. The city will be built near the Conchagua volcano in the Gulf of Fonseca to take advantage of geothermal energy to power both the city and Bitcoin mining — the energy-intensive solving of complex mathematical calculations day and night to verify currency transactions. The government will provide land and infrastructure and work to attract investors. The only tax collected there will be the value-added tax, half of which will be used to pay the municipal bonds and the rest for municipal infrastructure and maintenance. Bukele said there would be no property, income or municipal taxes and the city would have zero carbon dioxide emissions. The city would be built with attracting foreign investment in mind. There would be residential areas, malls, restaurants and a port, Bukele said. “Invest here and earn all the money you want,” Bukele said at the closing of the Latin American Bitcoin and Blockchain Conference being held in El Salvador. Bitcoin has been legal tender alongside the US dollar since September 7. The government is already running a pilot Bitcoin mining venture at another geothermal power plant beside the Tecapa volcano. The government is backing Bitcoin with a $150 million fund. To incentivise Salvadorans to use it, the government offered $30 worth of credit to those who use its digital wallet. Bitcoin was originally created to operate outside government controlled financial systems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/el-salvador-to-build-cryptocurrency-fuelled-bitcoin-city/articleshow/87839336.cms||---
---||Noida||Greater Noida: YEIDA floats global tender to select developer for Rs 10,000 crore Film City project||GREATER NOIDA: The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) on Sunday initiated the global tender for the Rs 10,000-crore Film City project, which will come up at Sector 21 on a public-private partnership in three phases. The first phase of the project is expected to be ready by 2024 and the final phase by 2029. “This will be the first Film City of Uttar Pradesh and the third in the country after Mumbai and Hyderabad. It will be more extensive and expansive than the current two film cities in the country. Since it is in close proximity to the upcoming Noida airport in Jewar and the Yamuna expressway, the Film City will be well connected through road and air and is expected to generate direct employment to about 40-50,000 people,” YEIDA chief executive officer Arun Vir Singh told TOI on Sunday. Investments worth Rs 17,000 crore are expected from the project, he added. According to officials, the global tendering bid will be available on YEIDA and National Informatics Centre (NIC) websites with the ‘request for proposal’ (RFP) from November 23 while its pre-bid will be held on December 8. The detailed project report (DPR) was approved by the UP government on November 20. While work on the project is expected to begin mid-January next year when the developer is finalised, it may be delayed due to the code of conduct in lieu of the state assembly elections scheduled early next year. The technical and financial qualification of the developer for the project, officials said, will be as per the RFQ (request for quote) and RFP documents, which include prior construction, development and project experience in the films and media-related sector with a minimum net worth of Rs 2,500 crore. “The concession period will be for 40 years that may be extended to 30 more years. Bid parameter includes annual premium or revenue share, whichever is higher, payable to YEIDA,” Singh said. The feasibility and DPR report of the Film City project was earlier submitted by consultant CBRE South Asia Private Limited on June 7 earlier this year. While the first phase of the Film City will include construction related to film production, such as film studios (on 20 acres), film facilities (740 acres), a film institute (40 acres), an amusement park (120 acres) with villas among others, the hospitality, resort and commercial activities will be developed in the second phase by 2026-27. Retail development and remaining all work will be undertaken in the final phase by 2028-29. “In the first phase, 80% of the film production-related work will be done so that shooting of films can begin at the earliest,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/yeida-floats-global-tender-to-select-developer-for-rs-10k-crore-film-city-project/articleshow/87837237.cms||Meenakshi Sinha
---||World||Fresh protests, violence erupt in Europe over Covid restrictions||BRUSSELS: A fresh wave of protests broke out in several European cities and in some French overseas territories on Sunday, as protesters reacted, sometimes violently, to moves to reintroduce coronavirus restrictions. Police and protesters clashed in the Belgian capital Brussels, in several Dutch cities and overnight into early Sunday in the French Caribbean territory Guadaloupe. There were fresh demonstrations in Austria, where the government is imposing a new lockdown and Covid-19 vaccine mandate. In Brussels, violence broke out at a protest against anti-Covid measures which police said was attended by 35,000 people. The march, in the city's European Union and government district, largely focused on a ban on the unvaccinated from venues such as restaurants and bars. It began peacefully but police later fired water cannon and tear gas in response to protesters throwing projectiles, an AFP photographer witnessed. Police told Belga news agency that three officers were injured. Several of the demonstrators caught up in the clash wore hoods and carried Flemish nationalist flags, while others wore Nazi-era yellow stars. Protesters set fire to wood pallets, and social media images showed them attacking police vans with street signs. Protests also erupted in several Dutch cities Sunday, the third night of unrest over the government's coronavirus restrictions. Demonstrators set off fireworks and vandalised property in the northern cities of Groningen and Leeuwarden, as well as in Enschede to the east and Tilburg to the south, said police. "Riot police are present in the centre to restore order," a Groningen police spokeswoman told AFP. Authorities issued an emergency order in Enschede, near the German border, ordering people to stay off the streets, police said on Twitter. A football match in the nearby city of Leeuwarden was briefly disrupted after supporters, who are barred from games because of the Covid restrictions, threw fireworks into the ground, Dutch media reported. On Friday night, there was unrest in Rotterdam and last night in The Hague. So far, more than 100 people have been arrested around the country and at least 12 people have been injured during the demonstrations. And in Austria, around 6,000 people gathered in the city of Linz in a protest organised by a new political party, a day after 40,000 marched in Vienna over the partial lockdown. From Monday, 8.9 million Austrians will not be allowed to leave home except to go to work, shop for essentials and exercise. And vaccination against Covid-19 in the Alpine nation will be mandatory from February 1 next year. Troops headed to Guadeloupe on Sunday after a week of unrest over Covid measures, while Prime Minister Jean Castex was set to convene a meeting in Paris with officials from the French Caribbean island. Roads remained blocked on Sunday after protesters defying a curfew looted and torched shops and pharmacies overnight, when police made 38 arrests and two members of the security forces were injured. The dusk-to-dawn curfew is set to last until Tuesday. The Guadeloupe prefecture said protesters had fired on security forces and firefighters. The level of vaccination against Covid is lower in some of France's overseas territories than on the mainland, but the government warned Sunday that even there, there were worrying signs of rising infections. "The fifth wave is starting at lightning speed," government spokesman Gabriel Attal told media. Europe is battling another wave of infections and several countries have tightened curbs despite high levels of vaccination, especially in the west of the continent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/fresh-protests-violence-erupt-in-europe-over-covid-restrictions/articleshow/87839276.cms||---

The accused had gathered to watch the show in which a lion is seen killing and feasting on the carcass of a cow that was tied to a pole and used as a bait to lure the big cat at a village in Gir forest of Junagadh, an official said on Sunday. The show was organised at a village in Devaliya range of Gir forest on November 8, he said. The Gir forest national park and wildlife sanctuary, also known as Sasan-Gir, is known as the "last abode" of Asiatic lions. “We have filed an FIR against 12 unidentified persons and three persons have been detained for questioning. The action was taken on the basis of a video which shows a group of people gathered to watch an Asiatic lion kill a cow tied to a pole. The organiser used the cow as bait to attract the lion for the illegal lion show,” deputy conservator of forest (Junagadh), S K Berwal said. Some of them are seen recording the show on mobile phones. The accused have been booked under various sections of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, including sections pertaining to hunting (section 9), official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/gujarat-video-of-illegal-lion-show-with-cow-as-bait-viral-12-booked/articleshow/87839429.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Capt Jayant Joshi’s father writes to President, highlights ‘glaring gaps’ in Army aviation||CHANDIGARH: A month after sending his son Capt Jayant Joshi on his last journey after the Army aviator’s body was retrieved from Ranjit Sagar Lake in Jammu and Kashmir 76 days subsequent to Rudra attack helicopter crash on August 3, Harish Chander Joshi has sought President Ram Nath Kovind’s personal attention by highlighting ‘glaring gaps in safety processes being followed in Army aviation’. Capt Jayant’s father, in a letter, addressed to the supreme commander of the defence forces, mentioned, “it very much evident, lack of training as well as lack of basic safety gears for flying over water are perhaps to be blamed for this crash and unfortunately, all Army pilots fly in the same situation.” ‘ Accountability must be fixed for death of my son Capt Jayant’He urged the President to ensure making it mandatory for all Army pilots, like their counterparts in the Navy, to undergo underwater survival training, equip them with the essential lifesaving gear and ensure life-saving skill upgradation through periodic training modules. “Their flying machines should also be made float worthy,” added Joshi. The aggrieved father also requested the President that the accountability must be fixed for the death of his son Capt Jayant and test pilot as well as aviation instructor Lt Col Abheet Singh Batth. “Those responsible for violation of safety norms, apathy and complete disregard to pilot safety and survival training be brought to book and a commensurate action be taken against them,” reads the letter. Joshi has mentioned that Capt Jayant’s helicopter had crashed on the water at a speed of 170 kmph as per the cockpit voice recorder/flight data recorder (CVR/FDR) finding. Despite this high-velocity crash and impact, Capt Jayant was able to de-harness himself from his seat after the crash as his seat belt was found to be properly opened. The same was the case with the other pilot. Had a life-saving jacket been provided to both the pilots, they would have floated on the water surface and could have been rescued to the nearest medical facility by the locals and the rescue boats of the dam authorities that had reached the crash site within 15 minutes of the crash on August 3, he added. “If the Rudra was not meant to be flown over water, then why were the helicopters of the squadron being routinely sent to fly over a vast expanse of water that was 25 km long and 8 km wide?” asks the aggrieved father. At the same time, he added that in the event of a war, Army pilots will not have an option to choose between flying over water or the ground in the enemy territory to acquire their targets. But, flying over water as a routine requires specialised training about depth perception which is different from flying over land, due to reflection from the water surface. “I am told that as per CVR/FDR analyzed by the court of inquiry team, flying very low and deeply engrossed in acquiring the target, and aligning it on to the integrated weapons, both the pilots did not realise that they were going to hit the water,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/capt-jayant-joshis-father-writes-to-president-highlights-glaring-gaps-in-army-aviation/articleshow/87839386.cms||Sanjeev Verma
---||Gurgaon||2 years after Haryana’s approval, work on key RRTS stretch awaits Centre's nod||GURUGRAM: Over two years after the first phase of the Delhi-Alwar corridor of the Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS), which will run between Delhi and Shahjahanpur-Neemrana-Behror (SNB) Urban Complex in Rajasthan, was approved by the state governments of Haryana and Rajasthan, civil work on the project is yet to begin pending the final nod from the Centre. According to officials from the National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC), Haryana and Rajasthan had approved the detailed project report (DPR) for the corridor in February and June 2019, respectively, following which the document was sent to the central government for approval. “The DPR of the Delhi-Gurugram-SNB RRTS Corridor has been approved by state governments concerned and is under active consideration of the central government for approval. We are, however, doing pre-construction work at this stage so that we can start civil work as soon as the approval is received. Once we get the approval, we will be able to start the civil work within a month,” an NCRTC official said. The pre-construction activities in Gurugram include shifting or modifying utilities and widening roads wherever required, officials said. So far, officials have identified 22 electric high-tension (EHT) lines that are infringing on the corridor and need to be shifted for “uninterrupted construction” and operation. While 12 of these are being shifted by NCRTC, the remaining 10 are being shifted by the Power Grid Corporation of India in coordination with local authorities. NCRTC is also shifting some power distribution lines between the Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited (IDPL) office in Dundahera and Rajiv Chowk. Around 80 per cent of this work has been completed. In terms of road widening for the elevated sections of the corridor, officials said it was focusing on the stretch between the IDPL office and Atul Kataria Chowk, where around 90 per cent of the work has been completed. In the first phase of the RRTS, three corridors — Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut, the Delhi-Gurugram-SNB-Alwar and Delhi-Panipat — are being prioritised. The Delhi-Alwar corridor will be constructed in three phases, of which the first will be a 107-kilometre-long corridor between Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi and SNB Urban Complex that will run via Gurugram. Around 83 kilometres of this stretch will fall in Haryana, while 22 kilometres in Delhi and two kilometres in Rajasthan. Of the 16 stations in this corridor, seven will be located in Gurugram, of which two will be underground while the rest elevated. The travel time between the two extremes of the corridor will be 70 minutes. Similar to the Delhi-SNB stretch of the Delhi-Alwar corridor, officials said the 103-kilometre-long Delhi-Panipat RRTS corridor is also awaiting approval from the central government. Work on the 82-kilometre Delhi-Meerut corridor, in contrast, is underway in full swing. “The Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut corridor is at quite an advanced stage. We are expecting to be able to operationalise the first priority section of it by the end of next year though the targeted timeline was March 2023,” an NCRTC official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/2-years-after-states-approval-work-on-key-rrts-stretch-awaits-centre-nod/articleshow/87837383.cms||Sakshi Dayal
---||India||PM’s decision on farm laws has again proven that he listens to public opinion||This year, the Parkash Purab of Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji became even more special with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement that the three farm laws would be repealed and the reopening of the Kartarpur sahib Corridor. Any nationalist, any person who thinks about the welfare of our farmer and the agriculture sector will welcome this announcement. It also brings closure to the tumultuous happenings in the months gone by, which have pained all of us. I too would like to pay my tributes once again to the farmers who have shown great courage. Prime Minister Modi’s decision has again proven that he listens to public opinion. In his address he outlined numerous steps taken by his government for farmers. There was no conditional or phased withdrawal and the PM took a firm decision. The fact that the Prime Minister himself announced this was not missed on people. It was easy for the announcement to be made by someone else or even announce it on the floor of Parliament. Yet, this was done without any political considerations of win or loss. To see the Prime Minister’s decision as a “climbdown” or “weakness” is not true. In a democracy, there is nothing bigger than listening to the will of the people and there is no bigger democrat than a leader who does that. As a soldier who has had the honour of serving our Motherland for years, I welcome this move. The bitterness on the ground was becoming more acerbic by the day. At the drop of a hat, people were calling each other names, attributing motives, or questioning people’s loyalty to our nation. None of this augur well for national progress. Overseas, it became a rallying point for elements who want to destroy India’s unity. Nations like Pakistan, who never have and never will defeat us on the battlefield had their strategies ready for a proxy battle using our proud and patriotic farmers. This one announcement by the Prime Minister punctured those half-baked dreams. At a larger level, this isn’t the time to play politics, least of all on issues concerning farmers. A substantial share of our population depends on agriculture for their livelihood. It is our farmers who keep our nation fed. Likewise, I urge everyone not to use the Sikh faith for their own politics. The memories and wounds of the 1980s are for everyone to see. If anyone plays politics on these issues, the people will teach them a lesson. As a devout Sikh, who is deeply influenced by the teachings of the Guru Sahibs, the Prime Minister’s announcements struck a chord with me. No Sikh has missed the fact that the announcements to withdraw the farm laws happened on an auspicious day. The Prime Minister quoted Guru Nanak Dev Ji and Guru Gobind Singh Ji. He used the phrase ‘Kshama Bhaav’ in his address. It is obvious that he is seeking to build a connect with the Sikh community. Just a few days before this announcement, the Prime Minister was kind to open the Kartarpur corridor for devotees. In the last year, he has bowed at two Gurudwaras in Delhi. Which Sikh did not feel happy when the Sri Guru Granth Sahib returned from Afghanistan and found a special respect in our nation. Sikhs in India are staunchly patriotic. They have fiercely fought the Mughals and the British to defend their motherland. In India, Sikhs have gone on to become President, Prime Minister, Cabinet ministers, chief ministers, Army chiefs, top business tycoons, actors, artists and gained immense success in a wide range of fields. In his address, the Prime Minister has given a message of affection and conciliation to the Sikh youth. I have always said that being a border state, Punjab deserves more sensitive handling, and I am happy that this is being done. At the same time, I hope we also take note of the miserable condition of Sikhs (and other minorities) due to Jihadi mindsets in Pakistan and Afghanistan. A lot of chatter is being made, especially by my previous party about the political undertones of this decision. I want to show a mirror to such people. The CAA protests began in late 2019. In the subsequent Delhi elections, the Congress got a golden zero for the second time. They tried to politicise the return of migrants during Covid lockdown and in Bihar, a state with a significant number of migrants the Congress’ electoral performance was so bad that their friends in RJD could not make it to power (redux of UP 2017)! In the assembly polls in May this year at the peak of Covid and farm laws, the Congress did not win in Kerala even though the state has a history of alternating between the Left and Congress. In Puducherry they lost their government while in Bengal and Assam it was a whitewash of sorts. Instead, of course correcting on these issues, it destabilised Punjab, the sole state where they have won every election since 2017. In contrast, BJP held on to its own in Delhi, emerged single largest in Bihar, formed Governments in Bihar and Puducherry and improved significantly in Bengal, all during the period of farm laws. Thus, it is high time we stop attaching politics motives to every decision. Those who know me can vouch for one thing- I play with a straight bat. This is what I have learnt in the army and I will follow this till my last breath. In 1984, I was the first person to quit Congress after the disastrous Operation Blue Star. I was among the earliest to call for a peaceful solution to the farm bills issue, even undertaking the withdrawal of the laws. In the state assembly and, when that has been done, I owe it to my nation and my conscience to appreciate it. What PM Modi has done is in the interest of the Sikh community; it is in Punjab’s interest and importantly in our national interest.

The deceased has been identified as Sandeep Chaudhary (30) from Mumta village in Kangra’s Nagrota Bagwan. Police have registered a case and taken possession of the body. In the last five years, over two dozen paragliders have crashed at various places in Kangra and Mandi districts after taking off from Billing and 10 pilots, including foreigners, have died. Sandeep had come to Bir Billing along with his friends and decided to experience paragliding. Safety harness came loose minutes after take offHe fell on the roof of a house near Bir from a height of about 150ft after the belt and harness allegedly came loose minutes after takeoff. On October 16, a paragliding pilot’s helper had died after getting entangled in ropes while helping during takeoff at Kangra’s Indrunag site. His entangled frame hit the ground from a height, killing him on the spot. Earlier, in January this year, a paraglider pilot had gone missing after taking off from Billing area in Kangra’s Baijanth sub-division. His body was found five months later, in May end, from the Dhauladhar range.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/himachal-pradesh-paragliding-accident-kills-tourist-in-bir-billing/articleshow/87839315.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Rapid rail pier design tweak to delay flyover, underpass?||GURUGRAM: The public works department (PWD) may give the December 31 deadline for the Atul Kataria Chowk infrastructure development a miss and it may not just be because of the air pollution-induced ban on construction activities across the NCR. Recent amendments in the project design suggested by the National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) to enable the construction of metro piers for the Rapid Rail Transit System (RRTS) set to pass through the area, officials said, might add to the delay. One of the busier junctions in the city connecting areas that see high footfall, two development projects are underway at the Atul Kataria Chowk— a 900-metre flyover between the Gurgaon bus stand and Kapashera and a 700-metre underpass between Sheetla Mata Mandir and Maharana Pratap Chowk – to ease traffic congestion in the key intersection in old Gurgaon. While work on the Rs 58.35-crore project had started in April 2019 with an initial deadline of November 30, 2019, it got delayed due to repeated ban on construction activities, Covid-induced lockdown and subsequent shortage of labour as well as due to delay in shifting utilities. On Sunday, a senior PWD official told TOI: “The piers for the Delhi-Alwar corridor of the RRTS are coming up at Atul Kataria Chowk and the NCRTC, which is constructing the RRTS, has asked for some additional enforcement for these which in turn requires a change in our design. The NCRTC has asked for some additional protection around the piers. This will require minor amendments in the design and it is likely to affect the deadline.” The amendments to the design, the official added, are yet to get the final approval from higher authorities, “pending which the PWD cannot start the work”. The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) had handed over the task of executing the construction at the Atul Kataria Chowk to the PWD. According to PWD officials, if the construction ban is extended further, the work at the intersection will anyway be delayed. “We are trying to get the design amendments approved in the meantime to minimise the impact on the project,” the official said. The section of the RRTS corridor that will pass through the area falls under phase 1 of the Delhi-Alwar corridor, which will connect Delhi with the Shahjahanpur-Neemrana-Behror (SNB) urban complex via Gurgaon and Rewari. Although the project is awaiting the final nod from the central government, NCRTC has started “pre-construction activities” in anticipation of the approval, including casting of piers at Atul Kataria Chowk that commenced last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/rapid-rail-pier-design-tweak-to-delay-flyover-underpass/articleshow/87837424.cms||Sakshi Dayal

There is a possibility of one more female athlete, Aanchal Thakur, qualifying for the Olympics. Only three athletes – all alpine skiers – are trying for Olympics qualification abroad. While Mohammad Arif Khan from Kashmir has earned the quota for the 2022 Winter Olympics, Manali youth Aanchal and Olympian Himanshu Thakur will be participating in qualification races till mid-January. According to sources, it will be very challenging for Himanshu to get through as Arif has already earned good FIS (International Ski Federation) points at Dubai competitions. Arif has 16 more races in hand this season to strengthen his claim for quota for the Olympics. On the other hand, the season for Himanshu and Aanchal started very late as the siblings were struggling to fund their training and travel expenses until October. While there is still hope for Aanchal to qualify for the Olympics by performing well in coming FIS-accredited events, Himanshu will have to perform extraordinarily well to earn the only available quota for alpine skiing events. Currently, Arif has made sure that he is the only athlete from India to carry the national flag in Winter Olympics being held from February 4 to 20. As not many athletes are trying for qualification races, there is a possibility that, at most, two athletes will represent the country. Unfortunately, no athlete from India tries for events other than skiing. Shiva Keshavan, who was the only luge athlete from the country, has already announced to quit the sport as an active athlete. At present, he is coaching an international luge team in Beijing. Arif, who was trying hard to qualify for the Olympics for years, has won many medals in domestic tournaments. Though hit hard by lack of funding, he managed to visit abroad for training and take part in international skiing events to earn required FIS points. He will be participating in some more events to earn more points for a better ranking. “I was training in Austria. I’ve worked hard on my techniques. I will be taking part in qualification races till January 15. I’m happy that I have qualified for the Olympics and will represent my country,” Arif said. Ski and Snowboard India secretary general Roopu Negi said Arif has qualified for the 2022 Olympics only in four races out of a total of five. “We are proud of him. He has been struggling hard for years. Hopefully, he will make the country proud. We plan to train many more young athletes with help of top international coaches with an aim to win medals in the 2026 Olympics,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/only-1-athlete-may-represent-india-in-winter-games/articleshow/87839402.cms||Suresh Sharma

Police said that the gang of Ashok Rathi, slain in 2019, got into a fight with a second gang involved in a triple murder in Basai last year. According to police, a disagreement between the two gangs escalated into a full-fledged brawl, with men from both sides hitting each other with utensils and sharp objects. Members of the gang involved in the triple murder case allegedly used sharp objects to slash the wrists and waists of the Rathi gang operators, Deepak from Rewari, Dheeraj from Khirki Daula, and Deepak from Bhiwani. Jail authorities rushed the three injured inmates to the Sector 10 Civil Hospital and then transferred them to PGI Rohtak. “The men are in stable condition. We have learnt about the involvement of nearly 14-15 inmates in the brawl,” said Jagbir Singh, SHO, Bhondsi jail. Police claimed that the brawl was the fallout of an already brewing enmity between the two gangs. Recently, an argument broke out between the two gangs during a court visit. However, the police, present on the scene, were able to calm the situation then. But on Saturday, nearly 14-15 members from the gang involved in the triple murders went to the barracks of the Rathi gang members and started beating them up. After hearing all the noises, the jail authorities arrived at the spot and pacified the men. Police are still investigating the matter. An FIR is yet to be filed. “We will record the injured men’s statement, following which we will take some concrete action,” said a police official. The three injured men have been in jail on murder charges. According to police, Dheeraj Rathi murdered the wife of gangster Ashok Rathi, and the case is currently sub-judice. Meanwhile, Deepak from Rewari and Deepak from Bhiwani are facing murder charges at the Kherki Daula police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/3-bhondsi-jail-inmates-injured-in-scuffle-between-2-gangs/articleshow/87837432.cms||Sagrika Kissu
---||India||Supreme Court revives cheating case against family owned Indian NGO||NEW DELHI: A Dutch NGO got relief from the Supreme Court after its complaint against an Andhra Pradesh-based family-run NGO, accused of duping it of RS 24 crore over a period of 10 years in the name of providing succour to 5,000 differently-abled children in 300 villages of the state, was quashed by Andhra Pradesh HC. A bench of Justices M R Shah and B V Nagarathna criticised the HC for quashing the criminal complaint against the wife and so of the main accused through a sketchy judgment and said, "Now, the trial court should proceed with the trial against all the three accused." 'Friends Indeed" was approached by a family-owned NGO 'Association for Rural Development and Action Research (ARDAR) in 2004 pleading for funds by sweet-talking their area of activities are very similar to that of the foreign NGO. Taken in by the tall promise of taking care of 5,000 differently-abled children in 300 villages and opening a children's village for orphaned differently-abled children, the foreign NGO transferred three million Euros (Rs 24 crore) to ARDAR between 2004-2014. But, finding that many schemes promised to be carried out have not taken off, the Dutch NGO through Johana Maria Legend filed a criminal complaint alleging that the family-owned NGO has siphoned off huge amounts from the funds meant for differently-abled children for the purpose of purchasing assets in their own names. Legend lodged a criminal complaint and the AP police filed a charge sheet. Later an agreement was reached between the foreign NGO and the head of the family, which owned the NGO, for the return of the assets. However, not much was returned. But, taking advantage of the agreement, the wife and son of the accused moved the HC seeking quashing of the criminal complaint against them claiming that since the agreement was between the main accused and the foreign NGO, they had no role to play. The HC believed them and quashed the complaint. Appearing for the foreign NGO before the SC advocates Vipin Nair and P B Suresh argued before the bench headed by Justice Shah that the commission of the offence was not denied and hence the HC was wrong in quashing the entire complaint against the wife and son of the main accused, which would obviously hold the man to take advantage during the trial. The bench agreed and said, "We are of the opinion that the impugned judgment and order passed by the HCquashing the entire criminal proceedings against the private respondents – accused Nos 2 & 3 (wife and the son) - is unsustainable. The HC has exceeded in its jurisdiction in quashing the entire criminal proceedings with respect to the very serious offences, in the exercise of powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C., by a sketchy judgment and order." "Even the HC has not taken note of the charge-sheet filed against the accused which was after thorough investigation. Merely because in the subsequent MoU, the accused Nos 2 & 3 were not signatory and only the main signed, that does not mean the accused Nos 2 & 3 were not at all involved in the commission of the offence," the bench said, reversing the clean chit given by the HC. "It is required to be noted that the offences alleged by the accused along with other IPC offences are for the offences under Section 120-B read with 34 of the IPC. If the criminal proceedings against A-2 & 3 are quashed and set aside in that case, straight away the benefit would go to the A-1 also as the offence under Section 120B and 34 would become redundant," the SC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-revives-cheating-case-against-family-owned-indian-ngo/articleshow/87839447.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

India recorded less than 72,000 cases of the coronavirus in the week (November 15-21), making it the lowest point in the pandemic since early June last year. Cases fell by 11%, a week after the decline in infections was halted post-Diwali. In that week (Nov 8- 14), India posted 80,639 cases, nearly the same number as in the Diwali week (80,708), raising fears that the festivities may have led to a spike. Worst-hit states show drop in casesHowever, the big fall in numbers this week will go some way in allaying such fears. Although numbers have inched up in some states and UTs, the worst-hit states of Kerala, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu showed a drop in cases. Last week, infections had spiked a bit in Maharashtra and Karnataka.   India reported 2,257 deaths from the virus during the week, down from 2,596 in the preceding seven days. However, a substantial number of fatalities in the both weeks were old deaths added to the toll in Kerala. The states and UTs that registered a rise in Covid cases this week include J&K, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Meghalaya and Ladakh. But the numbers most of these states/UTs were not high enough to cause much concern. J&K logged1,188 cases during the week, an increase of 84 over the previous week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/two-weeks-after-diwali-covid-cases-at-17-month-low/articleshow/87839574.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

---||World||Austria begins national lockdown to fight surging infections||VIENNA: Austria went into a nationwide lockdown early Monday to combat soaring coronavirus infections, a step being closely watched by other European governments struggling with national outbreaks that are straining health care systems. The measures are expected to last for a maximum of 20 days but will be reevaluated after 10. They require people to stay home apart from basic reasons like getting groceries, going to the doctor and exercising. Restaurants and most shops must close and larger events will be canceled. Schools and day care centers can remain open, but parents are encouraged to keep their children home. Austria hopes to lift the measures on Dec. 13 but may keep a further lockdown on the unvaccinated. The new lockdown measures kicked in a day after many Austrians hurriedly enjoyed a last day out at coffeehouses and Christmas markets across the country. Christmas markets across central Vienna were packed Sunday with people eager to buy gifts and enjoy one last round of warm drinks and food. At the Freyung Christmas market in Vienna, Alexandra Ljesevic and her sister Anna sipped mulled wine and punch amid wooden stands and under sparkling holiday lights. ``It's the last chance to feel the Christmas time and vibes,'' Alexandra Ljesevic said. The sisters said they feel luckier than most, since their jobs won't be affected by the lockdown. But they're not optimistic that things will reopen as quickly as authorities hope. ``It would be weird if in 20 days they said, `Okay, for vaccinated people, you're free to go,' if the hospitals are still overwhelmed,'' said Anna Ljesevic. ``That's the only reason why we even need the lockdown.'' Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg also announced Friday that Austria will also introduce a vaccine mandate as of Feb. 1. The details of how the mandate will work aren't yet clear. In an interview Sunday in the Kurier newspaper, Schallenberg said it's ``sad'' that the Austrian government had to resort to a mandate in order to ensure that enough people get vaccinated. Just under 66% of Austria's 8.9 million people are fully vaccinated, one of the lowest rates in Western Europe. On Saturday, Austria reported 15,297 new infections, after a week in which daily cases topped 10,000. Hospitals, especially those in the hardest hit regions of Salzburg and Upper Austria, are overwhelmed as the number of coronavirus patients rises in intensive care units. Schallenberg said he and other officials had hoped this summer that a new lockdown would not be necessary and it was a tough decision to impose one that affected vaccinated people. ``That people's freedoms need to be restricted again is, believe me, also difficult for me to bear,'' he said. The new measures, especially the vaccine mandate, have been met with fierce opposition among some Austrians and vaccine skeptics. A Saturday protest in the capital of Vienna drew 40,000 people, according to police, including members of far-right parties and groups. Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said Sunday that the country's anti-coronavirus protest scene is radicalizing. An ``extremely diverse group of people'' took part in the anti-vaccination protests, Nehammer said, according to the Austrian Press Agency, adding that included concerned citizens but also right-wing extremists and neo-Nazis. The lockdown is strictest measure Austrian officials have introduced to combat a fourth surge of infections and deaths. Earlier this month, the government first tried to pressure unvaccinated people to get the jab, barring them from restaurants, hotels and large events. Then officials implemented lockdown measures just for unvaccinated people. Nehammer said Sunday that police performed 150,000 checks in just one week to see if people outside of their homes were complying with the new rules, according to APA. At the Christmas market Sunday on Vienna's iconic Rathausplatz square, Rene Schlosser and Silvia Weidenauer sipped mulled wine from heart-shaped red mugs. They came for the day from their home in Austria's Waldviertel region to get a glimpse of the markets before everything shut down. ``You have to accept it,'' Weidenauer said of the lockdown. ``There's no other option. All you can do is hope that these days when everything is closed actually have an effect.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/austria-begins-national-lockdown-to-fight-surging-infections/articleshow/87839671.cms||---

A promise that has been delayed by over 11 years since his first announcement. While IPS officers still doubt its execution sooner, insiders say that a delegation of MP IAS officers have already made up their mind to meet Chouhan on Monday and keep their side on the system. Under the new system, a commissioner does not have to report to the district magistrates. And, the judicial and executive powers from inquiries to granting license, permits and permissions -- will be shifted to police officers from magistrates. Since police officers above a certain rank get magisterial powers under the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) in this system and the authority shifts from the magistrate to within the police hierarchy, some IAS officers see it as an "encroachment into their territory" and a move to undermine cadres' superiority. Sharing information about the implementation of the Police Commissionerate system in Bhopal and Indore, Chouhan had on Friday praised the police and emphasized on the system saying that the urban population is increasing rapidly. "Chief ministers had been misled into implementation of the system by IAS officers for long. This may happen again," said a senior IPS officer wishing anonymity. "This is the PM's initiative and no one can hold it any longer," he added. An IAS officer had another opinion. "People used to lodge their complaints against police with District Magistrates, but once the new system is implemented who would they approach?" he asked wishing not to be named. Earlier in April 2012, Shivraj Singh Chouhan had promised implementation of the police commissioner system in these two cities, however, the process had ended up introducing the post of senior superintendent of police system in two cities. Later in February 2014, the then home minister Babulal Gaur had ruled out the possibility of implementing police commissioner system in the state saying the system was suitable for areas with more population but, Bhopal and Indore are less populated. Six years later in Congress regime, Kamal Nath as chief minister hinted towards implementation of the Police Commissioner system in Madhya Pradesh while addressing the inaugural ceremony of the two-day MP IPS officer's conclave in February 2020 saying, "It is true that I have not introduced police commissioner System in Madhya Pradesh so far, but it is also true that I have not rejected the proposal yet. In any case, there has to be harmony and coordination. Organs of government cannot be split". Former chairman of the MP IPS Association Vijay Yadav had also expressed concern over delay in implementation of the commissioner system during his inaugural speech in the same event. Later while speaking to the media, former chief minister Digvijay Singh had said that this system was successfully working in several metro cities. He had pointed out that implementation of this system had become a matter of conflicts between the IAS and IPS. Singh had said that dealing with law and order situation was a major problem in cities having population about 10 lakhs adding that "There should be a single authority to tackle the issues". "Despite several attempts, MP government had not been able to introduce this system following opposition from the IAS lobby, even as Yogi Adityanath led Uttar Pradesh government had in January 2020 switched to the commissionerate system of policing for Lucknow and Noida, giving magisterial powers to the top cops in both cities", said an IPS officer wising anonymity. Meanwhile RTI activist Ajay Dubey who had filed a PIL in HC for implementation of security commission said that there are many other matters which the government should look into. Dubey says the Commission is supposed to regulate the police functioning in the State, including their transfers and promotions. It will comprise the Home Minister, the Director General of Police (DGP), leaders from the opposition parties and social activists. The proposed amendments in the police Act have already been cleared by the State's law department, but the government is yet to implement it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/madhya-pradesh-commissionerate-system-stuck-in-ias-ips-wrangle-11-years-and-promises-later/articleshow/87839821.cms||P Naveen

Girish’s complaint mentioned another businessman from Bengaluru had been cheated of Rs 3.6 crore. Police did not identify the third businessman, saying they are yet to get confirmation from him. According to the two FIRs, Girish lost Rs 2.3 crore, Taram and the third businessman Rs 3.6 crore each. Police named Daniel Armstrong,Vivekananda Kumar and Ravi Raghavan as the accused. Girish has a real estate firm in Bengaluru and he was about to take up a new project. He was looking for a loan at a lower interest. One of the miscreants called Girish and asked him to contact Armstrong, who runs a finance firm in Krishna Nagar, near BTM Layout. Vivekananda and Raghavan met him and he received an email on November 8, in which they agreed to sanction Rs 150 crore as loan. “I met Armstrong on November 9 and they asked me to pay Rs 3 crore as advance payment of interest for the first three months and also Rs 2.3 crore as commitment fee . I transferred Rs 2.3 crore on November 15. They were supposed to disburse the loan by November 16, but they didn’t do so. Hence I visited their office but in vain,” Girish said. Taram alleged the trio had cheated him of Rs 3.6 crore. Taram wanted a loan for his project and the gang approached him. The gang arranged a flight ticket for him from Arunachal Pradesh to Bengaluru on October 25. He met them in their office and they agreed to sanction him Rs 240 crore. They sent him an email on November 8. Taram met Armstrong at his office on November 14. The next day, he transferred Rs 3.6 crore as a commitment amount, expecting the money by evening. When he did not get it, he visited Armstrong’s office on November 17 and realised that he had been cheated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-three-businessmen-looking-for-loan-lose-rs-9-5-crore-to-conmen/articleshow/87839807.cms||Santosh kumar.B

---||Chandigarh||PM Narendra Modi’s decision on farm laws has again proven that he listens to public opinion: Amarinder Singh||By Amarinder Singh This year, the Parkash Purab of Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji became even more special with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement that the three farm laws would be repealed and the reopening of the Kartarpur sahib Corridor. Any nationalist, any person who thinks about the welfare of our farmer and the agriculture sector will welcome this announcement. It also brings closure to the tumultuous happenings in the months gone by, which have pained all of us. I too would like to pay my tributes once again to the farmers who have shown great courage. Prime Minister Modi’s decision has again proven that he listens to public opinion. In his address he outlined numerous steps taken by his government for farmers. There was no conditional or phased withdrawal and the PM took a firm decision. The fact that the Prime Minister himself announced this was not missed on people. It was easy for the announcement to be made by someone else or even announce it on the floor of Parliament. Yet, this was done without any political considerations of win or loss. To see the Prime Minister’s decision as a “climbdown” or “weakness” is not true. In a democracy, there is nothing bigger than listening to the will of the people and there is no bigger democrat than a leader who does that. As a soldier who has had the honour of serving our Motherland for years, I welcome this move. The bitterness on the ground was becoming more acerbic by the day. At the drop of a hat, people were calling each other names, attributing motives, or questioning people’s loyalty to our nation. None of this augur well for national progress. Overseas, it became a rallying point for elements who want to destroy India’s unity. Nations like Pakistan, who never have and never will defeat us on the battlefield had their strategies ready for a proxy battle using our proud and patriotic farmers. This one announcement by the Prime Minister punctured those half-baked dreams. At a larger level, this isn’t the time to play politics, least of all on issues concerning farmers. A substantial share of our population depends on agriculture for their livelihood. It is our farmers who keep our nation fed. Likewise, I urge everyone not to use the Sikh faith for their own politics. The memories and wounds of the 1980s are for everyone to see. If anyone plays politics on these issues, the people will teach them a lesson. As a devout Sikh, who is deeply influenced by the teachings of the Guru Sahibs, the Prime Minister’s announcements struck a chord with me. No Sikh has missed the fact that the announcements to withdraw the farm laws happened on an auspicious day. The Prime Minister quoted Guru Nanak Dev Ji and Guru Gobind Singh Ji. He used the phrase ‘Kshama Bhaav’ in his address. It is obvious that he is seeking to build a connect with the Sikh community. Just a few days before this announcement, the Prime Minister was kind to open the Kartarpur corridor for devotees. In the last year, he has bowed at two Gurudwaras in Delhi. Which Sikh did not feel happy when the Sri Guru Granth Sahib returned from Afghanistan and found a special respect in our nation. Sikhs in India are staunchly patriotic. They have fiercely fought the Mughals and the British to defend their motherland. In India, Sikhs have gone on to become President, Prime Minister, Cabinet ministers, chief ministers, Army chiefs, top business tycoons, actors, artists and gained immense success in a wide range of fields. In his address, the Prime Minister has given a message of affection and conciliation to the Sikh youth. I have always said that being a border state, Punjab deserves more sensitive handling, and I am happy that this is being done. At the same time, I hope we also take note of the miserable condition of Sikhs (and other minorities) due to Jihadi mindsets in Pakistan and Afghanistan. A lot of chatter is being made, especially by my previous party about the political undertones of this decision. I want to show a mirror to such people. The CAA protests began in late 2019. In the subsequent Delhi elections, the Congress got a golden zero for the second time. They tried to politicise the return of migrants during Covid lockdown and in Bihar, a state with a significant number of migrants the Congress’ electoral performance was so bad that their friends in RJD could not make it to power (redux of UP 2017)! In the assembly polls in May this year at the peak of Covid and farm laws, the Congress did not win in Kerala even though the state has a history of alternating between the Left and Congress. In Puducherry they lost their government while in Bengal and Assam it was a whitewash of sorts. Instead, of course correcting on these issues, it destabilised Punjab, the sole state where they have won every election since 2017. In contrast, BJP held on to its own in Delhi, emerged single largest in Bihar, formed Governments in Bihar and Puducherry and improved significantly in Bengal, all during the period of farm laws. Thus, it is high time we stop attaching politics motives to every decision. Those who know me can vouch for one thing- I play wisth a straight bat. This is what I have learnt in the army and I will follow this till my last breath. In 1984, I was the first person to quit Congress after the disastrous Operation Blue Star. I was among the earliest to call for a peaceful solution to the farm bills issue, even undertaking the withdrawal of the laws. In the state assembly and, when that has been done, I owe it to my nation and my conscience to appreciate it. What PM Modi has done is in the interest of the Sikh community; it is in Punjab’s interest and importantly in our national interest.

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Dalit's hand chopped in Rewa for seeking unpaid wages||BHOPAL: A Dalit labourer's hand was severed with a sword in MP's Rewa district on Saturday simply because he demanded his unpaid wages from his employer, say police. The accused hid the chopped hand in a field and fled, but a police team found it, and sped with it to a government hospital, where it was reattached that night. The incident took place at Dol village in Sirmaur area, around 35km from Rewa district HQ. The victim, 30-year-old Ashok Saket, had worked as a mason in building a house for the main accused, Ganesh Mishra, but wasn't paid his full wages, say police. Rewa SP Navneet Bhasin said the employer owed Ashok Rs 9,000 in wages. "When the worker went to the house of the accused for his wages around 1pm, his left hand was chopped off with a sword. The attackers hid the severed palm in a farm around 100 metres away and escaped," said the SP. The first policemen on the spot rushed him to hospital. "We had two priorities. First and foremost was to search for the palm and take it to hospital as soon as possible. The second was to arrest the accused," the SP said. One team was deployed to look for the palm and take it to the doctors as any delay would have left the victim disabled. Another team went after the accused. The palm was found in a farm after a half-hour search," said the SP. A team collected some ice, put the hand in a polythene bag and sped to Sanjay Gandhi Hospital. By 4pm, three hours after it was severed, doctors had the hand. "The patient was very critical when he was brought to us. He had lost a lot of blood and was in a state of shock. The first priority was to save his life. When he became stable, the hand reattachment surgery was carried out. Normally, this kind of surgery should be carried out in six hours, but we had the priority of saving life over limb. We will inspect the reattached limb on Monday," Sanjay Gandhi Medical College spokesperson Dr Yatnesh Tripathi, told TOI. "The update we have is that blood flow in the arteries has resumed. In all probability, it will be joined now," the SP said, adding that all three accused have been held.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-dalits-hand-chopped-in-rewa-for-seeking-unpaid-wages/articleshow/87839972.cms||Amarjeet Singh

Records of the past three months show that in August, a total of 347 new Covid-19 cases were reported in the state. This averaged to around 11 new cases per day. The same remained 356 cases in the month of September that averaged to around 11.8 new cases daily and in October a total of 323 new cases were reported in the state, averaging around 10.8 or 11 cases per day. In November so far, a total of 176 new cases have been reported - 17 new cases reported on Sunday - averaging to around eight new cases per day. In the same period, testing for Covid-19 has reduced in the state on a month-on-month basis from 70,000 tests per day in August down to average of around 53,000 cases per day in November so far. Thus, if seen statistically, the number of cases, might not have increased in the past three four months, but it has remained almost the same. Same is the case with the number of active cases: There were 95 active Covid-19 cases on August 20, while on September 20, there were 96 active cases and on October 20, there were 82 active cases. This has reduced only by four on November 20 as there were 78 active cases. But with 17 new cases being reported on November 21, it further increased to 85. Thus the number of active patients have also remained stable or has not increased as per the government data. However, they have also not decreased significantly in the state, despite the fact that vaccination coverage in these months have increased overall. Sources said that given to the conditions and the nature of the infection that spreads so fast, even though the restrictions have been removed by the state government, there is no way out than to adhere to the Covid-appropriate behavior that is wearing masks, maintaining social distance and hand hygiene, but this is not visible in MP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/covid-curve-yet-to-flatten-in-madhya-pradesh-active-cases-too-steady/articleshow/87840134.cms||Amarjeet Singh

---||Bareilly||Bareilly drug lord's assets worth Rs 50 crore seized||BAREILLY: In a crackdown against the smuggling and sale of narcotics in Uttar Pradesh, Bareilly police on Sunday seized assets valued at Rs 50 crore belonging to Shaheed Khan, alias "Chhote", a village head, identified as the leader of a gang operating from Bareilly district for the past several years. Additional SP (Rural) Rajkumar Agarwal termed this at "the biggest action against any drug mafia in the state so far." Police have also sought permission to attach assets worth Rs 16.5 crore of his nephew, Taimur Khan alias Bhola, who allegedly runs another gang of drug suppliers in Bareilly. According to police, Shaheed Khan, 52, is currently lodged in the district jail while most of his family members are either behind bars or have gone underground. Taimur Khan, around 35 years old, is serving time in Delhi's Tihar jail.  The additional SP said, "We have taken action under the relevant sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act Act. Now, these accused or their family members cannot sell, rent or gift these properties to anyone." Shaheed's assets include a shopping complex, agricultural land, a marriage hall, luxurious cars and multiple houses, he added. Shaheed and his nephew, Saif, were arrested on August 18 at Padhera village under Fatehgunj police limits. Twenty kg of heroine valued at Rs 20 crore in the Indian market and three times more in the international market were seized from them. Agarwal told TOI, "We found out that Shaheed has a vast network. He gets opium and other narcotic substances from Jharkhand and processes them into top quality smack, which is in high demand in UP, Punjab, Haryana and Delhi." He said that police had identified various assets acquired by Shaheed over the past six years, using the money earned from smuggling drugs. "We found that he had acquired assets worth Rs 51 crore in the past six years. We froze the assets and reported them to the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeit of property) Act tribunal for forfeiting the assets. Shaheed filed an appeal against the move and was asked to provide details about the source of income for the assets he and his family had bought," he said. He added that Shaheed and his family could only provide the sources for property worth Rs 1 crore. "The SAFEMA tribunal thereafter ordered seizure of the remaining property worth over Rs 50 crore," the additional SP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/bareilly-drug-lords-assets-worth-rs-50-crore-seized/articleshow/87840099.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Bharti Airtel, one of the country's oldest mobile operator, will be increasing tariffs for pre-paid customers by up 20-25% from November 26, signalling hardening of tariffs as companies look at ways to shore up profitability ahead of new investments in 5G and telecom network. Tariffs for post-paid customers may also go up further after some changes made recently. Airtel said that the move will help it raise mobile Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) – a key yardstick to measure profitability of mobile companies- to "Rs 200 and ultimately at Rs 300 so as to provide a reasonable return on capital that allows for a financially healthy business model." "We also believe that this level of ARPU will enable the substantial investments required in networks and spectrum. Even more important, this will give Airtel the elbow room to roll out 5G in India," the company said. Other operators, especially the financially-stretched Vodafone Idea, are likely to follow suit. However, as companies raise tariffs, the focus will again shift on the quality of services that have generally lagged the break-neck speed at which the Indian telecom sector has grown over the past few years. Airtel has raised the minimum voice tariff plan from Rs 79 to Rs 99, while making changes to other pre-paid voice and data bundled plans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/airtel-raises-tariffs-others-could-follow/articleshow/87840075.cms||Pankaj Doval

The sparse river that had been perennially dry swelled like never before and presented a grand spectacle.  The inflow into the river increased on Sunday and public works department officials said the discharges were more than a lakh cusecs of water. Old-timers said the Palar River had not been in spate for decades and some say not in a century. Several villages in Vellore district were disconnected after most of the rivers gushed and several low-lying bridges were submerged.  Most of the rivers, including Thenpennaiyar and Kedilam, in Cuddalore district are in spate after dams and reservoirs in their regions released surplus water. Villages along the banks of the two rivers were inundated. The water level in Sathanur Dam with a full capacity of 119 feet was maintained at 99 feet as the public works department has taken up maintenance work of its sluice gates. Hence all the surplus water received from Pampar Dam in Krishnagiri district was released from Sathanur Dam.  Meanwhile, the residents of delta districts of the state breathed a sigh of relief as the flood water that inundated their localities began to recede on Sunday. The residents got some respite as the rain took a respite, resulting in draining of flood water from hundreds of villages in the districts. The flow in both Cauvery and Kollidam rivers passing through Trichy was maintained at 18,940 cusecs and 50,701 cusecs respectively as of Sunday night. This was because the inflow was only from the surplus water discharged from the Mettur dam that attained maximum storage capacity. PWD officials said the situation in both the rivers was not alarming. There was no rainfall in the city or other immediate catchment areas on Sunday. While the Cauvery river can manage a maximum flow of 1 lakh cusecs and the flood carrier of delta districts, the Kollidam river can handle 2.50 lakh cusecs of water at a time. Cauvery river is handling only 18% of its capacity while Kollidam handles 25% of its designated capacity. Since the recent heavy rainfall in the Cauvery delta districts have eliminated the need for canal-based irrigation, PWD officials said the water flow in Cauvery river heading to Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts was restricted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-rivers-swell-like-never-before/articleshow/87840262.cms||---

If similar court judgments come for disputed shrines of Kashi and Mathura, another two Pakistani hubs will come up in the country.” The Shankracharya raised objection to handing over 5acre plot to Muslims by the Supreme Court in its Ayodhya judgment. “Muslims will be constructing a grand mosque in Ayodhya, which will be the epicentre of anti-national activity by those nurturing allegiance to Pakistan,” he said. Reacting to Shankracharya's statement, IICF secretary Athar Husain said, “It’s unbelievable that a seer can issue such a statement that fuels hatred against a community. If he has said these words, it’s very unfortunate. I will not make any comment on a Shankaracharya because Islam teaches us to respect religious heads.” Talking to TOI, Acharya Satyendra Das, chief priest of Ramjanmabhoomi temple, said, “These are the personal views of the Puri Shankaracharya. Supreme Court has given land for Ram temple and for the mosque. There’s no dispute left in Ayodhya.” The mosque trust constituted by the Sunni Waqf Board (Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation) has chalked out a blueprint to construct a mosque, a 300-bed charitable hospital, community kitchen and a research centre on in hannipur village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/puri-seer-ayodhya-mosque-land-will-turn-into-pakistani-hub/articleshow/87840320.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan
