This is the first time that a women’s club from India is participating in a continental championship. Gokulam Kerala earned the right after winning the Indian Women’s League (IWL) and Priya wants the team to make this count. “This is the first time an Indian team is participating in the championship and we want to make history here,” Priya told reporters on Saturday. “The AIFF started the league five years ago and now women’s football is growing all over India. This is a very good thing. If we do well here, it will help since India is hosting the AFC Asian Cup (in January next year).” Gokulam Kerala will open their campaign against Amman Club at the Aqaba Development Corporate Stadium, Jordan, on Sunday. Even before the team reached Aqaba, Priya had singled out the Jordanian champions as their toughest opponents. Iran's Shahrdari Sirjan and Uzbekistan's FC Bunyodkor are the other contenders. “Our girls are eager to perform. I hope we can get maximum points for all our games here in Jordan,” said Priya, whose team prepared for the continental assignment with friendlies against under-16 boys’ teams. The team has 10 national team players who have had international exposure as part of India’s preparations for next year’s Asian Cup. The foreign players include strikers Elshaddai Acheampong (Ghana), Karen Stefanny (Colombia) and Win Theingi Tun (Myanmar). Puerto Rican midfielder Adriana Tirado and Ghana defender Susan Ama Duah complete the foreign lineup. Amman club coach Khaled Nemer is confident that the Jordanian champions – who won the league unbeaten -- can start on the right note at home.  “We don’t know much about the Indian team, but I believe the players are ready for their first match. We will focus on our strengths to play at our best in this tournament. “Both teams are champions in their respective leagues. There will be tough games ahead, but that will only test our strengths to push forward,” said Nemer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gokulam-kerala-want-to-create-history-in-jordan-priya/articleshow/87560317.cms||---
---||Delhi||As Delhi's air turns toxic, doctors say N95 better than cloth masks to combat pollution + COVID||Delhi’s air quality severely dipped post Diwali, with many areas in the city recording an Air Quality Index (AQI) over 500. Even though the air quality improved slightly on Saturday due to higher wind speed, the AQI was still over 400. With the COVID pandemic still not over and now the toxic air, experts say it’s time to change our masks to combat both the issues. ‘Switch to N95 masks to protect against COVID and pollution’Dr Anupam Sibal, Group Medical Director and Senior Pediatric Gastroenterologist and Hepatologist, Apollo Hospitals Group, shares, “From pollution point of view, a cloth mask is not ideal and a lot of people who are aware of this, have been wearing an N95 mask during this time. If you have a history of allergy, asthma, bronchitis or any other respiratory issue, then it is advisable that you wear an N95.” “For pollution, the simple cloth masks are not good,” adds Dr Arvind Kumar, Chairman, Institute of Chest Surgery, Chest Onco-Surgery and Lung Transplantation and co-Chairman, Medanta Robotic Institute, “A cloth mask is okay, not ideal for COVID, ideal has been N95. But when N95 masks were not available, we were advocating for surgical or double cloth masks. But that is not good to protect from air pollution. If you want to protect yourself from COVID and pollution, switch to N95.” He adds, “For COVID, N95 is 99% effective, surgical mask is 60-70%, single-layer cloth mask is 30-40% effective and double-layered cloth mask is almost as effective as surgical mask. But with air pollution, you have particulate matter, and for that you need to wear N95 masks.” Read AlsoDelhi's air quality continues to remain 'severe' with 533 AQIThe air quality index of Delhi continues to remain in the 'severe' category, informed the Centre-run System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research on Saturday.‘Air pollution may lead to severe COVID cases’All India Institute of Medical Sciences Director Dr Randeep Guleria says, “Research from the SARS outbreak in 2003 in countries like the US and Italy has shown that the areas with higher levels of pollution impact those previously affected by COVID-19, causing inflammation and lung damage. The combination of pollution and COVID-19 could lead to higher fatality rates.” Dr Ashok Seth, Chairman, Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, adds, “People who recovered from COVID are vulnerable to this (air pollution). Many of them have got residual lung problems, either minor or major. The toxic gases and particles affect the lungs directly.” (ANI) ‘Restrict outdoor workout if you have respiratory issues’Dr Anupam Sibal shares that our choice to step out has to be individualised. “If someone has respiratory issues, it’s better to be cautious. For COVID, you can go out by following COVID Appropriate Behaviour (CAB), but if you have respiratory issues, let the AQI get better and then you can go out,” he says. Dr Piyush Goel, Consultant, Pulmonology, Intensive Care, Allergy and Immunology from Columbia Asia Hospital, Palam Vihar, shares, “People should continue to follow CAB and step out only while wearing a mask. But this is not the time to do any physical activity in an open space. If you want to work out, do it indoors.” Dr Manoj Sharma, Senior Consultant, Internal Medicine, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, adds, “The pollution levels are high during early morning and late evening so minimise outdoor activities during those periods. The air is relatively better in the late afternoon, so if people want to ventilate their homes, they can do so during that time.” Read AlsoAir pollution: Delhi deploys 114 tankers to sprinkle water to settle dustNEW DELHI: The Delhi government on Saturday deployed 114 water tankers to sprinkle water on roads to settle dust, one of major contributors to air pollution, after the national capital's air quality deteriorated following the Diwali festival.

The annual dialogue in Paris was chaired by NSA Ajit Doval and Emmanuel Bonne, diplomatic adviser to French President Emmanuel Macron. Doval also held discussions with French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, who emphasised strengthening the strategic partnership in areas of defence, security, civil nuclear energy and space. The convergence between the countries was evident with India welcoming EU’s Indo-Pacific strategy and looking forward to France’s presidency in early 2022. “The two sides will pursue these objectives through enhanced bilateral cooperation, deepening engagement in regional institutions and jointly working with and assisting other countries in the Indo-Pacific region,” said the Indian statement. In another meeting with French defence minister Florence Parly, Doval discussed ways to support India’s “defence industrialisation and self reliance”. The two sides discussed global security challenges including terrorism, recent developments in the Indo-Pacific and Afghanistan. France, according to a statement by the Indian embassy in Paris, stressed its continuing commitment to the Indo-Pacific region as a resident power and to partnership with India as a major pillar of its Indo-Pacific strategy. “France reiterated its commitment to fully support PM Modi’s vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat and defence industrialisation, joint research and technology development in India across a wide range of advanced capabilities, based on long-standing cooperation and mutual trust,” said the Indian embassy statement. In his meeting with Doval, Le Drian also stressed the importance of defending a free and open Indo-Pacific “based on the rule of law”. Notwithstanding its differences with the US and Australia because of the termination of a defence contract with the latter, following the AUKUS Indo-Pacific pact, France remains an indispensable partner for India in the Indo-Pacific.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/france-commits-to-support-indias-defence-industrialisation/articleshow/87560626.cms||---

His statement came a day after Sidhu’s remarks over the selection of Deol as advocate general. The development is unprecedented as it is the first time that an AG has made such a statement against the state chief of the governing party. On Friday, Sidhu had announced while withdrawing his resignation that he would not resume charge until a new AG takes over and a new panel (with the name of the new DGP) is cleared. Sidhu had resigned on September 28, objecting to the Channi government’s appointment of Deol as AG and Iqbal Singh Sahota as DGP. “His (Sidhu’s) repeated utterances seek to derail the earnest efforts of the state government to ensure justice in the ‘drug matter’ and the ‘sacrilege cases.’ There is a concerted attempt by vested interests to malign the functioning of Congress in view of coming polls in Punjab for their selfish political gain by politicising the constitutional office of AG Punjab (sic),” Deol said in a statement. Deol’s appointment had triggered a debate as he had represented ex-Punjab DGP Sumedh Singh Saini, who faces charges in the Behbal Kalan firing incident related to Punjab’s sacrilege cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/punjab-ag-hits-back-says-sidhu-obstructing-work/articleshow/87560807.cms||---

Vehicular traffic from Thanamandi to Rajouri was suspended in view of the cordon-and-search operation in Khablan and other nearby villages in the district. Earlier, the search was limited to the Surankote and Mendhar forest areas in Poonch district and Thanamandi in Rajouri district. The search operation was launched Friday night and the road was closed to traffic early Saturday morning. "The search team also fired a few rounds, the operation is still on," sources said. While the police and the Army maintained that no contact had been made with the suspected terrorists, unconfirmed reports stated that one terrorist had been neutralised. During the almost month-long search operation, nine soldiers, including two JCOs, have been killed in two separate encounters — in Surankote forest on October 11 and in Mendhar forest on October 14. A Pakistani terrorist, Zia Mustafa (detained in Kot Bhalwal Central Jail, Jammu), who was taken to Mendhar on police remand to identify the hideout in the area, was killed while two security personnel accompanying him were injured in Bhatti Durrian forest in Mendhar when they came under fire from terrorists on October 24. Security forces had neutralised one terrorist in a gunfight in Thannamandi area of Rajouri district on September 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jk-encounter-search-widened-to-more-areas-on-day-27/articleshow/87560944.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||India||Covid-19: 'States have 16cr vaccine doses unutilised'||NEW DELHI: Nearly 16 crore unutilised doses of Covid vaccines were available with states and UTs till Saturday morning as vaccinations dropped significantly in the Diwali week (October 30-November 5) after showing improvement during two previous weeks, official data shows. Perhaps due to a festival lull, only 2.42 crore doses were administered during the week ending November 5, nearly half of the more than 4 crore doses given in the previous week (October 23-29). “This was a Diwali week with many people travelling. So, the drop is not surprising. Also, a large number of people has been given the first dose. The coverage will grow as per schedule,” an official said. Overall, total inoculation crossed 108 crore doses on Saturday with over 78% of the eligible adult population covered with at least one dose of the vaccines. More than 36% people above 18 years have been covered with the second dose of vaccine. While many people are overdue for their second dose, the government has asked states to streamline the process and identify individuals who are still unvaccinated or have not taken their second dose. The Centre is also running a special campaign ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ with an objective to reach out to such individuals and address issues that may be holding them back. It has also asked states to reach the elderly and those with mobility issues at their homes. Earlier this week, PM Narendra Modi urged all healthcare workers and magistrates of districts with low coverage to “knock on every door” to ensure double dose vaccination as per schedule. He exhorted district magistrates to go down to the villages, localities and even households and find out people who are still unvaccinated or are overdue for second dose. For the first dose, the Centre has asked states to aim covering all eligible population by end of November.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-states-have-16cr-vaccine-doses-unutilised/articleshow/87561214.cms||---

The victims, who were aged between 35 and 70 years, included four women. District guardian minister Hasan Mushrif said despite funds being provided to upgrade infrastructure, the fire-fighting equipment was found to be inadequate. While district guardian minister Hasan Mushrif said an eight-member probe team headed by divisional commissioner Radhakrishna Game will probe the fire, health minister Rajesh Tope announced an ex gratia of Rs 5 lakh each for the kin of the dead. Mushrif said despite funds being provided to the hospital to upgrade its infrastructure, the fire-fighting equipment was found to be inadequate. Ahmednagar NCP MLA Sangram Jagtap said the entire ICU wing on the ground floor was engulfed in thick black smoke, creating problems for the hospital staff in evacuating patients. The rescue efforts could be carried out only after the fire brigade arrived. Mushrif said stern action will be taken against those responsible. Acting DIG of Nashik range Deepak Pandey said an offence of causing death due to negligence will be registered against unknown persons for the deaths. Police will investigate the case independently. CM Uddhav Thackeray and PM Modi expressed grief over the incident. Ahmednagar district collector Rajendra Bhosale said bodies have been sent for postmortem. There are two ICU wings in the hospital — one on the ground floor and the other on the first floor. The fire broke out in the ground floor unit. It took the fire brigade about half an hour to douse the blaze, but by then beds and several equipments had been gutted. Shankar Misal, chief fire officer of the Ahmednagar municipal corporation, said “Hospital staff used the fire extinguisher, but black smoke, zero visibility and intense heat hampered their efforts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/11-covid-patients-die-in-maharashtra-hospital-fire/articleshow/87561266.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Bengaluru||Lack of agency coordination hurts civic growth in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: Lack of coordination among civic agencies is proving a major impediment to Bengaluru's development. After a lot of hue and cry, the state government a few years ago set up a high-powered committee headed by the chief secretary to improve coordination among agencies that seem to be eternally working at cross-purposes. But nothing seems to have changed as the panel has made little or no impact on the ground as projects continue to criss-cross and cause problems for citizens. The panel was formed to discuss and exchange details about various projects under way and line up programmes for the next month to identify and analyse potential obstructions. It was to provide guidance and inputs for preparation and effective implementation and to reduce inter-agency hiccups that may affect the smooth progress of civic work. Utility work is being done on no less than 5,000 km of roads across the city with at least 5 to 6 agencies involved in major projects. They include the Bengaluru Smart City Projects, Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB), Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (Bescom), Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation limited (BMRCL). Their work is spread across 800 sqkm of the city. Chief secretary P Ravi Kumar was unavailable for comment. When TOI spoke to a few officials in these civic agencies, they said the coordination committee meetings were being held regularly but lacked impact because of failure at the ground level. “While the CS-led coordination committee does help when the heads of the civic agencies do not see eye to eye, at the ground level it is a completely different scenario. The ward-level coordination suffers as there is a mismatch in the wavelength of the engineers from different agencies,” said one senior government official privy to the meetings. Such is the situation that BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta is said to be taking along the entire entourage of BBMP, BWSSB, Bescom, Smart City and even Namma Metro officials wherever required on his regular visits of the city. Gupta said with the leeway of being in charge of the city’s major civic requirements, it was easier this way to get things done on the ground. “While there is a notion that there is a serious lack of coordination across the city among agencies, in some cases they work in tandem due to proper oversight by the local MLA or political boss,” said Gupta. BWSSB chairman N Jayaram said the coordination panel helps in ironing out any major concerns with other agencies but sometimes the message is lost in translation at the lower level. “While most times it helps to have these coordination committee meetings, there is also the flipside when the message delivered at the meeting is lost or misrepresented,” said Jayaram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/lack-of-agency-coordination-hurts-civic-growth/articleshow/87561287.cms||Sandeep Moudgal
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: After bypolls, parties shift focus to council elections to 25 seats||BENGALURU: After bypolls to Sindgi and Hangal assembly constituencies, the focus has shifted to the December elections for 25 legislative council seats from urban and rural local bodies. The elections are necessitated as the tenure of 25 sitting members, including social welfare minister Kota Srinivas Poojary, opposition leader in council SR Patil, senior Congress functionary KC Kondaiah will end on January 5, 2022. The election commission is expected to announce the schedule for these polls by this month-end or in the first week of December. “The election process should be completed before the end of the tenure of the sitting members. So accordingly the election commission will announce the dates,” said Mahalakshmi, secretary, Karnataka legislative council. The members of gram panchayats and urban local bodies like town panchayat, municipalities and corporations and MLAs and MPs are voters in these elections. Each constituency which covers a district will have 7,000 to 8,000 voters. Kodagu is an exception with just around 1,300 voters. There are also districts like Belagavi, Vijayapura, Mysuru and Chamarajanagar which have two seats each. Though these elections are not fought on party symbols, parties take active part as most candidates are either their members or supporters. Many sitting MLCs and prospective candidates have already started campaigning by way of meeting GP and ULB members. Once the poll dates are announced, the campaign is expected to gain momentum. “I have already started the campaign. I have been meeting GP members and educating them about their rights and responsibilities,” said KC Kondaiah. TP, ZP members to miss voting this timeThe zilla and taluk panchayat members will not be able to exercise their franchise in the council elections. There are no elected representatives in ZP and TPs as of now. The elections to ZPs and TPs have not been held though the tenure of the sitting members ended almost a year ago. It was delayed as the delimitation of wards and reservation fixed by the Election Commission was questioned in the high court. Even as the HC was hearing these petitions, the state government set up a delimitation commission to redraw boundaries of ZP and TP wards and the same has been conveyed to the court. It is yet to be known as to whether the absence of TP and ZP members comes in the way of holding council polls. An official from the council secretariat said a rule allows the elections to be held if 75 percent of the total electorate is ready for voting. “Since the number of ZPs and TPs in each local body constituency does not cross 200-300, there should not be any problem for holding elections,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/after-bypolls-parties-shift-focus-to-council-elections-to-25-seats/articleshow/87561288.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Sale of forfeited land valid if proceedings are dropped: Karnataka HC||BENGALURU: If the forfeiture order for violation of sections 79-A and 79-B of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act is set aside and/or recalled or the proceedings dropped, then any transaction entered into by the parties during the pendency of the order would continue to be valid and binding on the parties, the high court has said. Disposing of a petition filed by SK Rajan, a Bengalurean, the court has quashed the July 9, 2019 order passed by the deputy commissioner of Bengaluru Rural district, confirming the March 18, 2017 order passed by the assistant commissioner of Doddaballapur sub- division vis-a-vis cancellation of revenue entries in respect of about 9 acres of land at Bommanahalli village, Nelamangala taluk. The Nelamangala tahsildar has now been directed to effect mutation and revenue entries in favour of the petitioner in 30 days. The land was originally purchased by Maqboolunnisa but the government forfeited her of the land, citing that she was not an agriculturist and hence not eligible to purchase the land. Maqboolunnisa contested the land and sold it in January 1993. The property changed several hands before the petitioner, Rajan, purchased it in 2013. “The assistant commissioner or the deputy commissioner has no power or authority to decide the validity or otherwise of any transaction. The dropping of the proceedings would make them ‘functus officio’ insofar as the proceedings under Section 79-A and 79-B are concerned and no order could be passed exercising powers under the said provision. Be that as it may, no order under section 79-A and 79-B could be passed by exercising powers under Section 136(2) of the Land Revenue Act since both the enactments operate in different fields,” Justice Suraj Govindaraj has noted. The judge has also pointed out that in the case on hand, the property had been forfeited to the government in 1988 and the same was confirmed in 1992, while the agreement of sale was executed on January 4, 1993 when the order of forfeiture was in force. “However, the said proceedings have been dropped subsequently in 2006-07. The consequences of the dropping of the proceedings would mean that the forfeiture order is not in force, the slate has been wiped clean. It would therefore mean as if the forfeiture order was never in force,” the judge added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/high-court-sale-of-forfeited-land-valid-if-proceedings-are-dropped/articleshow/87561289.cms||Vasantha Kumar

When Murthy offered to teach Kannada to Thaawarchand Gehlot from Madhya Pradesh, who was appointed the governor of Karnataka recently, Raj Bhavan readily accepted it. Having tutored the language for over four decades to hundreds of Bengalureans, the 66-year-old is known among his students as Kannada Guru. Having started his teaching career at 24, Murthy has come a long way. He has learnt other languages like Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Hindi and English, mainly because he could easily tutor his respective students to learn Kannada. “I often reach out to people, and teaching them Kannada through their mother tongue is always a happy experience,” he says. Murthy, who has had experience of teaching bureaucrats, thought of reaching out to Gehlot when he assumed office. “I wrote a letter in Hindi and English to him on October 20 requesting an opportunity to teach him Kannada lessons. I received a call from his office the next day giving me a 20-minute appointment at Raj Bhavan,” Murthy says.  “I began classes for the governor who was quick in learning as I was teaching in Hindi. The class went on for 40 minutes,” he adds. Murthy is expecting another call from the governor’s office to start lessons from where he had left.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/kannada-guru-gives-lessons-to-governor/articleshow/87561291.cms||Petlee Peter
---||Bengaluru||Among Metros, motorists in Bengaluru pay less for fuel; dealers allege diesel smuggling to neighbouring states||BENGALURU: Motorists in Bengaluru are paying less for fuel among the Metro cities in the country since Thursday night. This is also probably the first time that fuel rates in Bengaluru are lower than those in New Delhi. On Saturday, a litre of petrol was sold in Bengaluru at Rs 100.58 and diesel at Rs 85.01. While Mumbai has the highest petrol rate among the major cities, Hyderabad motorists pay the maximum for diesel. Petrol rates in other cities as on Saturday were: Chennai (Rs 101.40), New Delhi (Rs 103.97), Kolkata (Rs 104.67), Hyderabad (Rs 108.20) and Mumbai (Rs 109.98). Diesel price in Bengaluru is lower than New Delhi (Rs 86.67), Kolkata (Rs 89.79), Chennai (Rs 91.53), Mumbai (Rs 94.14) and Hyderabad (Rs 94.62) as on Saturday. KM Basavegowda, president, Akhila Karnataka Federation of Petroleum Traders, said: “There is no major difference in petrol prices in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. It is because TN CM MK Stalin in August 2021 reduced petrol price by Rs 3 per litre.” Sales go northwardSources said the steep difference in the diesel price in Karnataka and neighbouring states has resulted in smuggling especially from places like Anekal, Dakshina Kannada, Belagavi, Kolar, Bidar, Kalaburagi, Chamarajanagar and Raichur. “Diesel is Rs 10 per litre cheaper in Karnataka than Andhra Pradesh. People from places like Chittoor in AP and Krishnagiri in TN are coming to Kolar. People from Hosur are visiting Anekal to smuggle diesel in large cans and sell it in those states. They are transporting upto 100 litre diesel on cycles, 200 litre in mopeds and 500 litre in auto rickshaws through borders. Even if they sell it for Rs 5 per litre less, they will make money in thousands a day,” Basavegowda said. He said sales of diesel have also gone up. “Many inter-state truckers and inter-city buses are filling diesel from Karnataka. Trucks have a fuel capacity of 400-800 litre. In addition to this, they buy extra in large cans,” he added. The Centre on Wednesday evening slashed excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 5 and Rs 10, respectively, which came into effect from Thursday early morning. Karnataka government’s Rs 7 per litre cut in the state tax on fuels was implemented at 6pm on Thursday. On Wednesday night, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai had tweeted: “Though it will mean a loss of Rs 2,100 crore to our exchequer, it will bring down the prices for our citizens to Rs 95.90 & Rs 81.50 (approx.) for petrol and diesel respectively”. However, many dealers disputed it, saying the fuel will cost more. Saturday’s rate in Bengaluru is Rs 4.68 and Rs 3.51 more per litre for petrol and diesel than the CM’s estimates. Meanwhile, the Union ministry of petroleum & natural gas stated 22 states/UTs have reduced state tax on petrol and diesel. “The most reduction in the petrol prices has been in Ladakh, followed by Karnataka and Puducherry. The prices of petrol in these UTs/states have come down by Rs 13.43, Rs 13.35 and Rs 12.85, respectively. For diesel, the most reduction has been undertaken by Ladakh, leading to price coming down by Rs 19.61 per litre there, followed by Karnataka (Rs 19.49) and Puducherry (Rs 19.08),” it said. Petrol customers feel the pinchWith petrol price at Rs 100.58/litre even after the revision, the poor and the middle-class who are dependent on two-wheelers for commuting are bearing the brunt. “The CM had announced that petrol will cost Rs 95.90/litre but it is still at Rs 100.58. It’s better to reduce petrol prices further to help the common man,” said Avinash S, a motorist in Koramangala. B Channa Reddy of the Federation of Karnataka Lorry Owners Association said: “It’s difficult to say whether prices of essential items will come down after the reduction of diesel prices. It is purely based on demand-supply. The government should further reduce petrol prices so the spending power of people will increase.” The city is home to over 1 crore vehicles, of which 70 lakh are two-wheelers. Bengaluru has the second highest number of two-wheelers in India after New Delhi. Experts attribute the two-wheeler count mainly to the poor and unreliable public transport system, traffic snarls, inadequate parking facilities, price and fuel efficiency (better than cars) and availability of vehicle loans. Two-wheelers are easily manoeuvrable in dense traffic. Oil industry sources said two-wheelers are the biggest consumers of petrol in the city, followed by cars. The price hike mainly affected delivery personnel and others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/compared-to-other-metro-cities-bluru-motorists-pay-less-for-fuel/articleshow/87561293.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

Fire and emergency services personnel and local police quickly arrived on the scene and rescued the trio. Businessman Mohammed Rafi from Vijayanagar told STOI that he went to the hospital around 11.30am to see a family friend who was admitted for treatment at the government facility. Rafi’s wife, Asma, and son, Tazin, were with him. “We were told that the patient, my friend, was on the second floor. When we visited the second floor, he was not there. We decided to return and entered the elevator by which we had gone up,” Rafi said. The elevator moved a few feet when it came to a grinding halt. “We thought it will resume and waited for some time, but nothing happened. Realising it was faulty, I tried dialling a number provided for emergencies inside the lift, but in vain,” Rafi said. Rafi then called the police control room and staff there informed fire and emergency services and the jurisdictional Shivajinagar police station. Police called Rafi back and told him they were on the job and asked him to remain calm. “Ventilation was not a problem inside, but my son began crying. Twice the lights inside the elevator went off, which made us a little apprehensive. We switched on the torch on our mobile phones whenever the power went off,” Rafi said. Hemant Kumar K, district fire officer from south fire station, Mayo Hall, reached the spot with five of his staff. Kumar said they brought the elevator back to the second floor using a pulley. “As the lift came up, we manually opened the door and got all three people out,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/couple-4-year-old-get-stuck-in-lift-for-40-mins-rescued/articleshow/87561295.cms||---

The accused had made a call to the father of the victim, 20-year-old Tarun, demanding Rs 50 lakh after having dumped the latter’s body in a storm water drain in Rajarajeshwarinagar. A hotel management student and son of wholesale vegetable merchant Mani, Tarun had gone missing since Sunday after he left home on Mudaliar Street in Bharathinagar to buy crackers from Hosur. His body was found on Tuesday inside a bag that was thrown into the drain. The accused are Tazimulla Pasha, 39, of JJ Nagar and Nazir, 26, of Valmikinagar. Tazimulla Pasha had worked with Tarun’s father Mani. “Pasha would drive the mini goods truck that delivered fruits and vegetables to marriage halls and other places, supplied by Mani. Earlier this year, Tazimulla had asked for a loan of Rs 1.5 lakh from Mani which the latter declined. Upset over this, Tazimulla had quit the job,” police said. On October 31, Tarun left home with Rs 2,000, saying he would purchase crackers from Hosur. Tazimulla told Tarun that he could get crackers at cheaper rates and took him to a relative’s house in Arekere and locked him inside a room. The duo gagged Tarun’s hands and legs and draped adhesive tape on his mouth. By midnight, Tarun tried to free himself and the duo strangled him to death. They put his body in a gunny bag. Using Tarun’s mobile, they called Mani and demanded Rs 50 lakh. In the wee hours, they shifted the body to Tazimulla’s auto and dumped it near the drain,” police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/2-brothers-held-for-kidnapping-killing-youth/articleshow/87561298.cms||---

Reacting to the Congress leaders’ claim that the prices were slashed following defeat in the Hangal bypoll, he said: “If the government would have reduced the prices before bypolls, they would have accused us of doing it to gain votes,” he added.  He said Congress should appreciate the steps taken by the state and the Centre to reduce the tax at one go, which none of their (Congress) chief ministers have done in the past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cm-cong-has-no-moral-right-to-grill-govts-on-price-hike/articleshow/87561302.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: ‘Disused’ lake set to get a new life||Bengaluru: Efforts are on to revive Kacharakanahalli Lake which was all but declared dead. While half of the waterbody was lost to a layout formed on it by its then custodian Bangalore Development Authority (BDA), the rest of the lake bed is encroached and dotted by slums and garbage dumps. A meeting of civic officials and elected representatives, both present and former, of the Sarvagnanagar Assembly constituency where the lake lies, was held to discuss the issue recently. The meeting comes in the backdrop of a Rs 2.5-crore tender to erect a fence around it. The tender was called on October 5. Kacharakanahalli Lake was among 19 of the 205 lakes under the BBMP that were tagged as “disused”. Locals admit that they have not seen water in the lake for over a decade now. Activists, however, have smelt a conspiracy in terming any lake disused, saying that it was only a prelude to legally taking over it. Over two years ago, former corporator Padmanabha Reddy wrote to then BBMP commissioner regarding the lake, which led to then chief minister BS Yeddyurappa’s office issuing an order to revive it. “The tale of Kacharakanahalli Lake dates way back to 1976 when the BDA took charge of it. Between 1982 and 1984, the BDA converted half of the lake bed into a layout. The mistake was committed by BDA officials and the then government that let this happen. We are merely trying to rectify the mistake by bringing this lake back to life,” Reddy said. “It is too early to say what we have planned for the lake. Once the encroachments are cleared and the fencing is in place, we’ll have to work on the DPR (detailed project report) and seek approval from the Karnataka Lake Conservation and Development Authority. Tuesday’s meeting was called to discuss how to proceed regarding the lake and no further details are ready yet,” he said. “Recently, a tender was called to fence the lake, but we are yet to remove encroachments from it. There are some people living in makeshift sheds on the lake bed and they need to be relocated,” Reddy said. “Land for them has already been identified near Nelamangala but the people are unwilling to relocate that far and are asking to be rehabilitated within the city limits which is difficult for us,” he added. V Ramprasad, an expert, said: “The concept that a lake is dead because it has been dry for a long period of time due to diversion of the inlets (rajakaluves) is not only absurd but outright stupid. Diverting the inlet channels and making a lake dry to help encroachment is the worst environmental disaster modus operandi for which future generations will pay an unimaginable price.” He added: “When we are treating sewage and filling up lakes in Anekal, Kolar and Chikkaballapur, the same can be done for both Banaswadi Lake and Kacharakanahalli Lake that is downstream.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/disused-lake-set-to-get-a-new-life/articleshow/87561303.cms||Mrinalini Bhat

While five of the injured hailed from Rajasthan and are into the business of making beds, two daily-wage workers are locals, police said. Jagadish Banjara, his wife Shanti Bai, Rodhu Banjara, his wife Manjubai and Jeetimolare are being treated at a hospital in Jigani. Dr Jagadish Hiremath, medical director at Ace Suhas Multispecialty Hospital, said Manjubai, Jagadish and Rodhu are critical and in ICU.“They may have to undergo multiple surgeries to rectify the defects caused by burns. We will need 48 hours to declare them safe. Since they inhaled the poisonous gas, they suffered internal injuries,” he added.Police said Valli and Prakash, who lived in another room of the same building, were treated as outpatients for minor injuries. The building, where the blast occurred at 7am, is located around 100 metres behind Jigani police station.“The cylinder as well as its pipe are intact.

At the government-run Minto Ophthalmic hospital, 23 cracker-injury cases were seen as on 8pm Saturday. Narayana Netralaya reported 20 cases — a majority of the patients were children — but none of them was sight threatening. At Sankara Eye hospital, Kundalahalli, 15 cases were reported. Two pertained to grievous injuries, and one of the victims was a four-year-old boy, a bystander who lost vision in one eye. At Minto, of the injured persons, 19 were children below 16 years and four adults. Ten of them were burning crackers themselves, while six others were bystanders. “Two boys aged 8 and 14 suffered grievous injuries. The extent of loss of sight is yet to be determined,” said Dr BL Sujata Rathod, director, Minto. Dr Rathod added that a majority of the patients were male children and most of them didn’t require hospitalisation. Two of the injured were females, including a 75-year-old woman who was hospitalised. The hospital saw one case each from neighbouring towns of Chintamani, Kanakapura and Ramanagara. At Dr Agarwal eye hospital, Yelahanka, an 11-year-old boy was treated as an outpatient on Saturday after both his eyes were injured. He has to be evaluated further, said doctors. The hospital’s Banashankari branch saw one case on Thursday. No cracker-injury cases were reported this year at Shekar eye hospital in JP Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/city-sees-60-cases-of-eye-injuries-in-4-days/articleshow/87561308.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||New study by IISc scientists sheds light on sickle cell anaemia||Bengaluru: A new study by researchers from the department of computational and data sciences at Indian Institute of Science (IISc) has shed light on the mechanism behind the aggregation of the mutant haemoglobin in sickle cell anaemia. Dibyajyoti Maity and Debnath Pal used simulations of haemoglobin’s molecular dynamics to arrive at the findings, the IISc said. Sickle cell anaemia is an inherited disorder in which red blood cells become deformed into sickle-like shapes, affecting their oxygen-carrying capacity. The condition is caused by a mutation in the gene coding for haemoglobin – the protein that carries oxygen within RBCs, the IISc said, adding that the shape of the RBCs gets distorted due to the aggregation of the mutant haemoglobin into fibrils inside the cells when the concentration of oxygen in the blood is low, and the haemoglobin molecule becomes tensed.“The haemoglobin molecule is made up of two dimers, each of which has two subunits. The researchers have shown that the angle between the two dimers of haemoglobin is a characteristic feature of the two states (tensed and relaxed) of the molecule, and demonstrated that both normal and mutant haemoglobin undergo tensed-to-relaxed transition irrespective of the presence or absence of oxygen when starting from the tensed state,” IISc said.The researchers have also predicted that an intermediate state between the tensed and relaxed states facilitates the transitions. Pointing out that the mutation responsible for sickle cell anaemia causes a molecule called valine to replace glutamate, the researchers said that their study has also determined that in the mutated form of haemoglobin, it is the absence of glutamate rather than the presence of valine that plays a greater role in the formation of fibrils in sickle cells.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/new-study-by-iisc-scientists-sheds-light-on-sickle-cell-anaemia/articleshow/87561309.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||All-woman team to head city chess||Bengaluru: Finally, Bengaluru has a governing body for chess. Led by an all-woman team, the Bengaluru Urban District Chess Association, formed recently under the umbrella United Karnataka Chess Association, aims to answer the prayers of many players looking for sustained chess activity through the year.Leading the 13-member team is Nirmala Raghunath, a parent who realised that exposure and tournaments, paramount to sharpen the competitive edge, could be developed in Bengaluru if like-minded people came together.The city has not lagged in terms of tournaments. UKCA increased tournaments as well as player base but its workload as the governing body in Karnataka led to the formation of a dedicated urban district entity. Eight parents, who travelled with their children around the country for tournaments for years, formed the BUDCA and sought UKCA recognition and registrar of societies before the elections in August.“We are players, tournament organisers and parents of players. Many have careers but share a common bond of giving back to the community. That’s how BUDCA was born. It’s the only chess association in the state governed by an all-woman team,” said Nirmala, whose daughter Sanjana is a FIDE-rated player.“We’d like to first address exposure and tournaments. As parents of national-level players looking for meets to enhance their ratings, we realised we could do the same in Bengaluru. Having travelled with our children, we learnt about administration and organisation of tournaments. If neighbouring states can be active, we too can be self-sufficient in the number of tournaments,” she added.Other parents – Kavitha Sundaresan, Bhargavi Ramanathiah, Vidyarani Valiyakath, Sowmya MU, Nalini C, Vidya Gururaja and Meenakshi Sadashiva – chipped in with ideas and decided to be part of the group. “Three organisers are with us — Jayanthi Hanumantha, wife of former UKCA secretary R Hanumantha who passed away this year, Rangamani HR and Shubharani Hebbar. They have immense experience organising tournaments. National-level players Shruti Krishnan (multiple state title winner and secretary of BUDCA) and Manasa Kongot bring unique abilities and experience,” said BUDCA vice-president Kavitha.The association will begin with its first monthly tournament at KASSIA, Vijayanagar, on November 14. “We’re keen on organising more offline tournaments and the monthly event will be first in nearly two years. This event coincides with Children’s Day. But monthly tournaments only help hone skills. The next step is to have many FIDE-rated tournaments every year. Rapid and blitz tournaments are on the cards. We’re working towards finding sponsors,” Kavitha said.Plans are afoot to popularise chess in schools and make inroads into colleges and corporate sector. “There is a huge potential among college kids. Children stop playing the game once they enter PUC or Class 11. But, there are many players keen on pursuing the sport and we plan to tap this group as well,” Kavitha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/all-woman-team-to-head-city-chess/articleshow/87561311.cms||---

The day also coincided with ‘Yama Dwitiya’, which is widely known as ‘Bhai Dooj’ festival. Thousands of devotees, especially Kayasthas, worshipped Lord Chitragupta in groups amid chanting of mantras at the special prayer service conducted at Thakurbari Mandir at Gardanibagh, Chitragupta Mandir near Nauzar Ghat in Patna City, Devi Asthan in Jahaji Kothi and New Yarpur among various pandals. Some devotees performed the puja at home. Stationery items like paper, pen, ink and account books along with honey, betel nut, mustard, ginger, jaggery, sugar, sandalwood and frankincense were used in the puja. According to Hindu mythology, Chitragupta was the accounts manager of Lord Yamaraj, who keeps track of all “good and bad deeds of men during their lifetime”. Chitransh Prince Club in Patna City’s Shikarpur area organised the prayer service and distributed prasad among devotees in the morning. It was followed by cultural events like bhajan and kirtan. Organising committee chairman Abhishek Verma said Lord Chitragupta used to keep the book-keeping of good and bad and based on his evaluation, a man is rewarded or punished. Shree Chitragupta Aadi Mandir Prabandhak Samiti at Sadikpur also organised a series of cultural events on the occasion. Rajesh Kumar Sinha, incharge of Samiti, said many kids, who haven’t yet started going to schools, took blessing of Lord Chitragupta to gain knowledge. The Bhai Dooj festival, on the other hand, mark the special bond between brothers and sisters. On the occasion, sisters curse their brothers first and then offer them sweets to apologise. Arpita Singh, a resident of Kadamkuan, said, “Sisters pray for their brothers’ long lives by applying tika on their foreheads and performing other rituals. In return, the sisters get gifts from their brothers.” Saumya Kumari, a resident of Rajendra Nagar, said cursing ritual was meant to ward off the evil spirits. “Later, we prick our tongues to apologise. This festival shows the sweet love bond between brothers and sisters,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chitragupta-puja-bhai-dooj-celebrated-with-fervour-in-patna/articleshow/87558625.cms||Faryal Rumi

Street vendors have started making preparations to sell traditional earthen stoves on Beerchand Patel Marg. These stoves are used by devotees to cook prasad, such as “kheer” and “thekua”. Stoves are being made with the soil brought from the Ganga river and mixed with straw and water. Mustakima Khatoon (42), a seller from Kamla Nehru Nagar slum area, has prepared 300 such stoves. “I have been making stoves for Chhath vratis for the past 10 years. It gives me immense pleasure when the customers admire my work. These stoves will be ready in the next two days. They just need proper sunlight. We avoid eating non-vegetarian food, garlic, onion and ginger while making stoves for Chhath,” Mustakima said. Niza Khatoon, another seller, said it’s the first time that she has prepared stoves. “It is indeed a huge responsibility because devotion and faith are attached to this festival. I have prepared these stoves under the supervision of my mother-in-law. Each stove costs between Rs 50 and Rs 60 depending on the size. We accept whatever the devotees give and never ask for more money,” she added. Apart from earthen stoves, vendors are also selling soop, daura and firewood. Soop and daura are available at Rs 100 a pair while mango wood is available at Rs 80-90 per 5kg in different markets at Kankarbagh, Chitkohra, R-Block and Mithapur. Ranjeet Singh, a shopkeeper near Professor’s Colony at Kankarbagh, said the firewood, soop, daura and betel leaf sales will mostly be sold from the day of nahay-khay. “We prepare soop and daura almost two months in advance and all the materials come from Parsa and Beur,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chhath-earthen-stoves-other-puja-materials-flood-patna-markets/articleshow/87558585.cms||Faryal Rumi

Belaur Chhath puja committee members said a large number of devotees would gather at the famous Belaur Ghat to observe the rituals. They requested the administration to make adequate parking facility and deploy enough police personnel, including women constables, at the ghat. A peace committee member drew the attention of the administration towards the dilapidated conditions of the road leading to the Ahirpurwa Ghat. The peace committee members also raised the issue of potholes on Agiyaon-Piro road leading to the Chhath ghat. One of the members, Om Prakash Munna, suggested that the entry of heavy vehicles be banned during Chhath festivities. Acting on the suggestions of the peace committee members, the DM asked Ara municipal commissioner and all the SDOs to ensure cleaning of the ghats under their respective jurisdictions. The SDOs were also asked to ensure setting up of adequate number of changing rooms for the Chhath devotees at different ghats. Keeping in mind the Covid restrictions, shops selling eatables and beverages will not be allowed near the Chhath ghats. The DM asked the SDOs to implement ban on plying of boats from the morning of November 10 to November 11 afternoon. The SDOs were also asked to set up watch towers at the crowded ghats. The Bhojpur civil surgeon was asked to keep the medical teams and ambulances ready for any eventuality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sale-of-eatables-prohibited-at-chhath-ghats-in-bhojpur/articleshow/87558609.cms||---

In fact, in some of the slums , the population density has shot up to about a lakh people per kilometre. As a consequence, there is immense stress on available resources, and waste management in these areas has gone completely off track. “In most of the slums along Rispana and Bindal, contaminated water is the major source of pollution, with people dumping garbage in it. Slum dwellers grapple with 24x7 stench, mosquitoes and insect menace, and the threat of water-borne diseases,” said Lalit Kumar, a Dehradun-based social worker. Rajesh, a migrant worker from Sitapur (Uttar Pradesh) who lives in Dehradun's Valmiki Basti (along Rispana), told TOI, “In absence of sanitation facilities and a proper waste management system, the hygiene conditions are getting worse here with each passing day. I fear for the well-being of my children but I can't afford a place anywhere else.” He added, “The Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns has not only left us without any income source but also aggravated health concerns of the people here.” Echoing a similar concern, Vimla, a migrant worker from Jharkhand who lives in Bhatra Basti (Kanwali Road), told TOI, “We live near a graveyard where open dumping of garbage is a common practice. The insect menace makes us all vulnerable to diseases. Additionally, the drains here remain choked with waste all year round. This place becomes unlivable after every rain spell.” When asked about the issues, Dr Kailash Joshi, Dehradun municipal corporation’s chief health officer, said, “We have already launched measures to improve the conditions in slum settlements. Drain jetting machines along with mosquito foggers have been pressed into service.” He added, “Apart from this, medical camps will also be organised in these areas and slum dwellers will be vaccinated against water-borne diseases. Large-scale awareness camps would also be conducted in slum settlements.” By Mansi Renu||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/choked-drains-open-garbage-dumping-mosquito-menace-slum-dwellers-in-dehradun-grappling-with-poor-sanitation/articleshow/87559292.cms||---

Municipal administration and panchayat authorities who distribute garbage dumping vehicles for segregation to civic bodies are overlooking scientific garbage disposal processes while ‘waste to wealth’ plants in villages remain in disuse. The plants were set up to ensure clean villages across Krishna district. The panchayat raj department along with locals established 960 solid waste treatment plants to make villages free of animal waste and garbage. Around Rs 80 crore was spent and the project was given top priority as a part of the Swachh Bharat Mission. But a majority of waste to wealth plants remain shut for months. “The waste to wealth plant in our village doesn’t even generate the money spent on establishing it. The plant located at the burial ground in Kanuru has been locked for months. Local farmers are ready to buy compost from it but no official is responding,” said Kodali Chanti Babu, a resident of Kanuru village. When TOI contacted district panchayat authorities, they said a special action plan is being designed to restore the plants. Action will be initiated against panchayat officials who are found lacking in implementing Swachh Bharat initiatives, a senior official of the panchayat raj department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/garbage-accumulates-at-waste-to-wealth-plants/articleshow/87559477.cms||Venu Lanka

Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma said four members of the gang had reached Patna from Rajasthan in an SUV and escaped with the ATM of HDFC Bank containing Rs 20 lakh. At least two armed SAP constables, who were present at the spot, had failed to stop the criminals. The broken ATM was recovered next day from Aurangabad district. The criminals had looted the money from it before fleeing Bihar, the SSP said. He added a police team was sent to Alwar in Rajasthan to conduct raids and arrest the accused persons, but to avail. “The arrests could not be made as panchayat polls were being conducted there. All the police personnel were engaged in conducting polling. Thus, the police team from Patna returned empty-handed,” he said. He added police have information that the gang members fled to Gujarat from Alwar after raids were conducted there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rajasthan-criminals-behind-atm-loot-ssp/articleshow/87559827.cms||---

Responding to a media query over the series of hooch tragedies despite prohibition, Singh said, “There is law against murder, and even capital punishment for that. But still people commit murders. When caught, they get even the capital punishment….. Law is law, if people violate the prohibition law, they will get punishment as per its provisions.” Referring to a previous hooch incident in Gopalganj in which those involved were awarded jail terms, Lalan said, “So many people were awarded punishment in the Gopalganj spurious liquor case. It is an example. Investigation is being done in the recent hooch cases.” Lalan was talking to media at the party’s state headquarters after inducting RJD leader Dharmendra Kumar and his supporters into the JD(U). Dharmanedra had unsuccessfully contested the 2020 assembly polls on the RJD ticket from Kumhrar and finished runner-up to BJP’s Arun Kumar Sinha by securing more than 54,900 votes. Lalan assured Dharmendra that he would have liberty to perform in the new organization. He also attacked the RJD and its president Lalu Prasad, saying, “The RJD is not a political party, but a private limited company or the party of a single family. The RJD MPs and MLAs do not get permission to meet the top party leaders despite waiting for several hours.” The JD(U) chief also alleged that Lalu and his wife Rabri Devi came to Bihar only for the assembly byelections and flew back to Delhi after the results. “They (Lalu family) are not bothered either for their party or the people of Bihar,” he said. JD(U) state president Umesh Singh Kushwaha presided over the ‘Milan Samaroh’ function.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-chief-rules-out-review-of-liquor-act/articleshow/87559790.cms||Madan Kumar

The state government has readied a plan to set up charging stations for electric vehicles at every possible location across the state. The government wants to encourage private developers to set up charging stations by taking government land at affordable leases in order to make AP a hub for green vehicles. The state government wants to see that at least one lakh EV charging stations are set up in the next decade. Since there is a steep increase in the number of electric vehicles in the state, the government is anticipating that the situation will completely change in the next three years. “We are getting ready for the future of the vehicle sector,” said a senior official. The nodal agency to handle EV charging stations, New and Renewable Energy Development Corporation of AP, has identified about 400 locations to set up charging stations in the first phase. NREDCAP has already completed negotiations with different government departments and private landowners who are willing to offer their land on a lease basis to develop charging stations. “We are inviting expression of Interest (EoI) for 400 locations in the initial phase and negotiations are on to expand the network,” NREDCAP vice-chairman and managing director S Ramana Reddy told STOI. He said they have already requested oil companies to float EV charging stations in existing petrol filling stations. According to the plan readied by NREDCAP, one EV charging station would be developed every 15 to 20 km on highways. The charging stations are also coming up within cities and towns to facilitate green vehicle users. The government wants to set up charging stations in office premises of government departments wherever sufficient land is available. The government will pay power and lease charges to the department which allows the developer to set up the charging station. “We are trying to assess the situation by calling EoIs to develop the stations. We have asked the developers to provide all details including how much they want to collect from customers, how much they could pay to the landlord, either private or government,” said a senior official who is closely coordinating the EV project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/state-to-pave-way-for-1l-ev-charging-stations-in-10-yrs/articleshow/87559404.cms||Samdani MN
---||Patna||Need for relook at prohibition law in Bihar: BJP||PATNA: A series of hooch tragedies in Bihar in the last few months, including four deaths in Samastipur since Friday night, has put the state government in an awkward position. State BJP president Dr Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal on Saturday pitched for an exhaustive review of the implementation of the five-year old state prohibition Act and even a “relook” as over 100 casualties due to spurious liquor since January this year has exposed the glaring lacunae in its implementation. Asked if the state’s prohibition law has failed, the Pashchimi Champaran MP said the Act was as hard, stringent and draconian as it could be, but the laxity is at the implementation level. “There is also a need for a relook at the policy. As many as five years have elapsed since the Act was framed. The in-depth review will throw up new insights even with regard to the policing aspect of the Act,” he said. His asking for an exhaustive review, more as an understatement, came as CM Nitish Kumar has also announced to make a detailed review of the prevailing situation involving illegal manufacturing, trade and consumption of liquor. The recent hooch deaths included 16 in Jaiswal’s home district of West Champaran since Wednesday and it is being apprehended that there could be 11 other unrecorded death cases, as the bodies were cremated surreptitiously to escape the likely police crackdown for consuming liquor that otherwise stands banned. “A peculiar situation exists in the state. The incidents of hooch tragedy occur in those districts whose police force have been particularly strict in the implementation of the Act. In other districts, where the implementation of the Act is lax or the police are in complicity (with the persons involved in the illegal liquor trade), the incidents of hooch tragedy do not occur!” Dr Jaiswal said. He admitted that “mafia elements” have spread themselves down to the block and village levels, adding that there was need to control their activities and also take action against them. “Here and there, a few people are being caught by the police, but mafia elements, who are spread down to the block and village levels, are generally not nabbed. Those in the manufacture and supply, rather the linchpins, have to be nabbed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bjp-need-for-relook-at-prohibition-law-in-bihar/articleshow/87559765.cms||Abhay Singh

However, Gopalganj SP Anand Kumar confirmed only 13 deaths so far. He told TOI over phone that the postmortem of all 13 persons of Mohammadpur village under the same police station area had been conducted. Sources from Gopalganj said the the authorities were not counting those deceased whose bodies had been cremated without informing the police. The SP said 30 persons have been arrested and police seized at least 390 litres of liquor from different police station areas in continuous crackdown on liquor smugglers so far. Officially, Manoranjan Singh and Raj Kumar Mishra from Mohammadpur died on Friday night. Sources said several persons whose names were not in the ‘official’ list of the deceased, are those who consumed liquor in Mohammadpur and left for different places. The SP said the postmortem examination was conducted on even those whose family members initially said they had several kinds of illnesses. “Things would get cleared from the postmortem and forensic test reports,” he said. He said at least 30 liquor pouches recovered from the two houses in Mohammadpur where they had consumed it, were sent for forensic analysis on Saturday after court order. Kumar said senior police officers in the district, including him, had a meeting with the chowkidars in the entire district after calling them at Thawe. “More than 550 chowkidars had gathered yesterday. They were sensitized for intelligence gathering against liquor smuggling and those involved in it. They were also sensitized about the kind of action they need to take to avoid hooch incidents,” he said.

After it was made mandatory by Delhi government to report all the cases of dengue in the wake of the recent surge in the number of patients, many hospitals are reporting cases from January, February and March. “Some hospitals are now reporting cases of dengue recorded in January. This should not be done. The cases should have been reported when they happened. The corporation would have had the situation in better control then,” said a senior official in the vector-borne disease department of the south corporation. According to the latest report of the corporation, there have been 1,537 cases of dengue across the national capital. Six deaths have been confirmed till October 31. “Hospitals are reporting past cases, which will not help much. There is no way to do anything about it, the records cannot be changed now,” said an east corporation official. Delhi reported 531 new cases of dengue during the week ending October 30, taking the city’s dengue tally to 1,537 this year. Of these, 1,196 cases were reported in October, while 531 were in the last week alone. All the corporations are identifying hotspots from where a large number of cases are being reported, officials said, adding that intense fogging drives and surveillance of water bodies are being carried out to tackle the situation. Additional beds for dengue patients have been reserved at a few hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpns-hospitals-reporting-old-dengue-cases-count-may-go-up/articleshow/87560395.cms||---

While RJD chief Lalu Prasad preponed his departure from Patna, posters were put up in the city on Saturday by unknown persons to attack him and his two sons – Tej Pratap and Tejashwi Prasad Yadav. The posters were erected on Beerchand Patel Marg and the Income-Tax roundabout showing Tejashwi (Arjuna) missing the target and Tej (Krishna) suggesting him to focus on it after shunning his “ahankar (ego)”. In addition, people squatting on the ground seek to know from Lalu, “hum lagte hain aapke kaun”. The posters, however, didn’t bear the name of any political outfit that erected them at the important locations in the city. It’s obvious that the posters have not been erected by RJD. Earlier, Lalu preponed his departure from Patna. He was supposed to stay here for about a month, but returned to Delhi on Wednesday. RJD spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwari, however, said Lalu went to Delhi for his medical check-up. “He was not feeling well and needed immediate medical attention. Hence, he left for Delhi much before his schedule,” Tiwari added. Another senior RJD leader said Lalu’s kidney problem aggravated in Patna, forcing him to leave the state capital much before his scheduled departure. He, however, admitted that Lalu was hopeful of winning at least Tarapur seat in the byelection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/posters-mocking-lalu-family-put-up-in-patna/articleshow/87559897.cms||Ramashankar

It will be initially implemented in Patna and neighbouring areas like Danapur, Khagaul and Phulwarisharif. The department is developing a software to help decide the routes for public vehicles through geographic information system (GIS). Transport officials have started the manual survey for urban public transport route planning, which includes the number of public vehicles, routes on which the vehicles are plying, travel demand pattern and exploring new routes. Transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said the number of public vehicles has been increasing in the state capital, causing huge traffic congestion on several routes and rise in air pollution. “To regulate the volume of traffic and rush on several roads, the department will chalk out the routes for autorickshaws, e-rickshaws and even buses, based on the survey report. We will hold a meeting with all the stakeholders, including public transport associations and ward councillors to check the requirement of public vehicles,” he said. Agarwal said there are surplus autorickshaws on some routes like Patna Junction and Gandhi Maidan while huge deficit in public transport services persists in some areas. “As per the number of public vehicles, we will plan the routes for autorickshaws, e-rickshaws and buses and how many vehicles will be run on each route will depend on the vehicle carrying capacity of the road,” he said. “The department will issue permit to new vehicles with routes mentioned while the old vehicles will be streamlined. Once this is implemented, all details regarding autorickshaws, e-rickshaws and buses, including the contact number and name of the drivers, will be available at a click. It will also help in tracking a vehicle in case of any emergency situation,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/transport-dept-to-map-out-routes-for-public-vehicles-in-bihar/articleshow/87558600.cms||Faryal Rumi

This is evident from the seizure of illicit liquor being smuggled to the state from outside since the panchayati elections were announced. According to the figures furnished by the police headquarters to the state election commission (SEC), over 3.38 crore litres of illicit alcohol were seized from September 1 to November 3 as part of the statewide drive launched by the police to check the use of liquor in the elections. The data revealed that around 54.06 lakh litres of alcohol were seized and 12,054 country liquor manufacturing units were demolished by the police in different districts during the first phase of polling. The quantity of liquor seized went up to 56.16 lakh litres and 14,034 country liquor manufacturing units were destroyed in the second phase of polling in the state. Surprisingly, the quantity of seized liquor went up to 57.60 lakh litres and over 16,063 liquor vends were demolished in the third phase of polling. In the fourth phase, the seized quantity touched 59.22 lakh mark and liquor brewing units demolished stood at 19,410. In the fifth phase, the seized quantity was recorded at 59.63 lakh while the number of demolished brewing units stood at 20,193. The sixth phase of panchayat polls recorded the highest seizure of 61.81 lakh litres. Likewise, altogether 22,774 brewing units were unearthed and subsequently demolished. The figures available with the SEC office suggested that average 25 country liquor manufacturing units were demolished in each panchayat since the announcement of the election schedule. So far, elections in 4,093 panchayats have already been held and results declared. “We provide the data of seized liquor and liquor brewing units demolished to the SEC as part of police action against liquor smuggling ahead of each phase of the election,” a senior police officer said. The data is collected by the police headquarters from the districts on daily basis. This is in addition to the action initiated by the state excise, prohibition and registration department, said the officer, preferring anonymity. State revenue and land reforms department minister Ram Surat Kumar said there were reports of high demand for liquor in the panchayat polls to lure the voters. “The state government is serious and will initiate stern action against the liquor smugglers,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/3-38-crore-litres-of-illicit-liquor-seized-in-bihar-in-last-2-months/articleshow/87559813.cms||Ramashankar

Crucial meetings to draw up the final reopening plans are slated for next week, when the vaccination status of students will be discussed. Some colleges have instructed students to WhatsApp the copies of their certificates to the respective heads of the department, while others have been told to upload scanned copies on the colleges’ portals. Some colleges are sending out Google forms, where students will have to fill in their vaccination details. In the reopening guidelines given to the educational institutes, the government has not mentioned anything about the vaccination status of students who will be called to the campus. But colleges and universities do not want to take any chance. Many are contemplating calling senior students first and some said they might give priority to those studying lab-based subjects. Most college authorities said they would ensure that all eligible students had received at least the first dose before coming in. “Most of our students and college staff have received both the doses. Some students will be due for their second doses in a few days. We are keeping a record of the vaccination status,” said Deepali Singhee, principal at J D Birla Institute. In many colleges, authorities are reaching out to students who are yet to receive a vaccine. “Most students have shared the copies of their vaccination certificates. Students who have not taken even one vaccine dose yet, we are trying to convince them to get it quickly as it is important from the point of view of safety, for travel and to be eligible for hostel accommodation,”said Subhasis Dutta, principal at Maulana Azad College. Jaipuria college will take a final decision next week. “Most students have been vaccinated. With three shifts in the college, we will have to decide on the arrangement so that everybody gets a chance to go to the campus on rotation,” said Jaipuria principal Asok Mukhopadahyay. At Jadavpur University, the authorities have directed students to fill up a form with their vaccination details and submit them by the morning of November 8. “Students must mention their department, year and vaccination status. This will give us an exact idea of how many students are vaccinated and the departments and years they belong to. Once the final plan is drawn up, this data will be of help,” said a JU official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/colleges-seek-students-vax-status-ahead-of-reopening/articleshow/87559992.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Visakhapatnam||Visakhapatnam: After legal tussle, VMRDA gets Rs 29 crore tax refund||VISAKHAPATNAM: Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA) received Rs 29 crore income tax refund on Friday in the first tranche. The urban development body has been recently exempted from income tax under section 12AA of the I-T Act by the I-T appellate tribunal for its land sale proceedings done between 2007 and 2010. According to the VMRDA officials, the then state government had entrusted the responsibility of land auctioning to the VMRDA (erstwhile Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority (Vuda)) to support the state’s budget from 2007-08 to 2009-10. Accordingly, the VMRDA auctioned some land pockets in its purview and remitted the sale proceeds to the tune of Rs 1,180 crore to the government. The I-T department had cancelled VMRDA’s registration under section 12AA in 2012 on the ground that the assessee was engaged in commercial activity in auctioning the lands to the highest bidders. It reopened the I-T returns from the assessment years 2005-06 onwards. The I-T department levied income tax of Rs 356 crore and Rs 26.19 crore for the 2007-08 and 2008-09 financial years respectively, which later swelled to over Rs 500 crore with interest. Aggrieved by the cancellation of exemption under 12AA and levy of income tax on the sale proceeds of government lands for the assessment year 2008-09 and 2009-10, the VMRDA approached various judicial forums even after paying nearly Rs 200 crore tax demand to the income tax department. A VMRDA official informed that the state government issued an official order in April 2013, wherein it clarified that the sale proceeds derived from the auction were the government receipts, but not the income of VMRDA. The order mentioned that VMRDA acted as an agent of the government and also confirmed that the sale proceeds were credited to the government account.

---||Vijayawada||Vijayawada: Canal bund improvement plans run into local opposition||VIJAYAWADA: In a major move, the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) is preparing an action plan to remove encroachments on canal bunds at eight major locations in the city. The measure comes as part of a canal bund beautification programme. Three major canals passing through the city have been getting polluted by sewage dumped into them by residents or encroachments on both sides of the bunds. The Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB) had raised serious objections to the dumping of wastes and requested the civic body to take necessary action. In 2017, the TDP-led municipal council drew up a proposal for canal bund beautification on Eluru, Ryves and Budameru bunds and decided to relocate locals to housing colonies. But the proposal was shelved due to lack of funds and following protests by opposition parties. Recently, the municipal council led by the YSRC approved relocating the residents of Budameru Madhya Katta, Madhuranagar Katta, Gunadala Katta and other canal bund areas. The proposal, however, has drawn the ire of locals. “We have been residing on this canal bund for the last twenty years. We are emotionally connected to this place. Instead of arranging a proper drainage system, municipal authorities are planning to relocate us. The YSRC promised regularising our houses. We will take up protests and seek the support of chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy,” said K Polinaidu, a resident of Gunadala Madhyakatta. Meanwhile, the CPI(M), CPI and Jana Sena are readying to take up agitations demanding the YSRC keep its promise and withdraw the proposal of relocation. Venkata Satyanarayana, YSRC floor leader, has assured that ‘pakka’ houses will be allotted to the residents of encroachments, before the constructions are demolished. “Opposition parties are trying to politicise the issue. Residents of canal bunds are facing issues of snake bites and poor sanitation. We will relocate them to housing colonies and develop greenery along canal bunds,” Satyanarayana told STOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/canal-bund-improvement-plans-run-into-local-opposition/articleshow/87559466.cms||Venu Lanka

One Guduru Sekhar had moved the high court challenging the GO, terming it illegal, arbitrary and irrational. The petitioner argued that Brahmin welfare corporation was originally constituted in coordination with the backward classes department, and was later transferred to revenue (endowments) department based on the recommendation of the former. The actual purpose of the corporation was well served under the revenue department and thousands of Brahmin community people benefited under various schemes introduced by the corporation. Now the government has reversed the decision without any basis and rational, argued the petitioner, adding that existing schemes are likely to get affected due to the move. He further alleged that the decision of the state government is unconstitutional, arbitrary and in violation of articles 14, 19, 21 and 300-A of the Constitution. The high court is likely to hear the petition on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/pil-in-hc-challenging-go-on-brahmin-corporation/articleshow/87559457.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Additional deputy commissioner DJ Borah, posted in Kaduka division of Upper Subansiri, reported that the disputed area overrun by the PLA was far from a civilian settlement when he conducted the 2020 survey. “What we saw were several big houses that looked like installations built for military purposes. I was told that when the Chinese PLA captured this area in 1962, they had just small posts there,” Borah told TOI. The mountainous area where structures built by the PLA now stands used to be the last post of the Indian Army until the 1962 War. Back then, the post was called Maza Camp. After the area was declared a disputed zone, the existing Army camp came up 4-5km inside Indian territory. The disputed land that the Chinese have taken over originally belonged to the Tagin community. In Arunachal Pradesh, full land ownership was the exclusive privilege of the community, tribe or clan until 2018, when the Arunachal Pradesh (Land Settlement and Records) (Amendment) created a provision for individuals to own land without anyone else having any claim to it. When the symbolic McMahon Line was identified as the boundary between British-governed India and Tibet in 1914, the land was split into two and the Tagins got divided as well, just the way the Naga community got bifurcated by the geographical boundary between India and Myanmar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pentagon-cited-china-village-a-pla-camp-arunachal-official/articleshow/87561376.cms||Prabin Kalita

The association has also requested that new applications of those who are eligible should be considered for the scheme. GSAI, in its memorandum, said that there are many retired seafarers and widows who are yet to apply for the scheme and are eagerly waiting for the new forms from the NRI department as the scheme will end on November 30. “Government must consider those previous applications which are not scrutinised. This pension scheme has been a financial support for the retired seamen and widows, who have contributed to the growth of our economy and development of the state. If the scheme continues for lifelong the retired seamen and widows will be grateful to the Goa government for supporting them in their hard times,” GSAI president Frank Viegas said. GSAI requested the NRI Commissioner to furnish data of the beneficiary seafarers/widows to the association who are yet to submit their life certificates. GSAI brought to the notice of NRI commissioner that some of the beneficiary seafarers /widows are yet to submit their life certificates to receive pension due to various reasons. “GSAI will reach out to maximum seafarers if the government furnishes the data to the association,” the memorandum states.

---||Delhi||East corpn battles ‘bogus’ addresses||New Delhi: Many instances of bogus addresses have come to the notice of East Delhi Municipal Corporation, which falls on the border of Uttar Pradesh. This is making tracking of dengue patients difficult and the fight against the disease tougher, say officials. “We are unable to trace many patients, who were admitted to hospitals in EDMC, as they gave fake addresses. We don’t know whether they were from Delhi or outside. Hospitals have been advised to thoroughly verify the address given by any dengue patient with a proper identification card,” said a senior official in the health department of the east corporation. According to the official, when a dengue patient visits a health facility, their personal details are noted down and later, a report is sent to the authorities concerned to strategise better. “According to our operating procedure, after we get the information that a dengue-infected patient is from a particular locality, we send our team of domestic breeding checkers to the area to kill that infected mosquito by fumigation and also to create awareness among the local residents. Many times, our teams get lost finding a patient's address and at the end, it turns out that there is no such address in existence,” said Ajay Handa, additional medical health officer, EDMC. Tracking the origin of the patients and then looking at the mosquitogenic conditions in their neighbourhood are crucial to controlling the spread of the virus before the infected mosquito bites more people. Divided among 64 wards, the corporation has around 830 domestic breeding checkers who are supposed to do door-to-door inspection of the affected area, checking for mosquito breeding. There are as many as 107 government and private health facilities in the east corporation, which has witnessed 294 dengue cases till Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/east-corpn-battles-bogus-addresses/articleshow/87560418.cms||---

---||Delhi||BJP wants Delhi govt to cut VAT on petrol, diesel||NEW DELHI: Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta, leader of the opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri and several other party functionaries protested near chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence on Saturday over AAP government not reducing value-added tax on petrol and diesel. Gupta said the Narendra Modi government has recently cut excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 5 and Rs 10, respectively, per litre; and urged the AAP government to cut VAT so that people get cheaper petrol and diesel in the capital. Bidhuri asked the AAP government to cut VAT on petrol and diesel by Rs 10 each per litre in Delhi. “After the central government slashed excise duty, 13 states and union territories have reduced VAT, but the Delhi government is still silent on it. Delhi has high VAT on petrol and diesel compared with other states. After the Centre’s move, there is now moral responsibility on the Kejriwal government to follow the suit,” the BJP functionary said. “When the Kejriwal government came to power in 2015, it used to levy only 20% VAT on petrol and 12% on diesel. It increased VAT on petrol and diesel to 30%. Although VAT on diesel was reduced to 16.75% in 2020, it is still higher than other states, while 30% VAT is highest on petrol,” Bidhuri said. Gupta said, “Till the Kejriwal government announces a reduction of VAT in petrol and diesel prices, Delhi BJP will continue to agitate in support of its demand.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-wants-delhi-govt-to-cut-vat-on-petrol-diesel/articleshow/87560426.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Speeding car mows down cyclist, injures 6 pedestrians at Kolkata's Chingrighata||KOLKATA: A cyclist was killed and six pedestrians were injured when a car owned by a Salt Lake-based veterinarian, in a hurry to cross the Chingrighata crossing around 4pm on Saturday even as the green signal turned yellow, hit an ambulance, the cyclist and then tried to make an abrupt U-turn hitting six other pedestrians. The car finally got stuck in a median curve. The cyclist, Toufik Ahmed, a resident of East Midnapore’s Kolaghat, died before he could be taken to a private hospital off Bypass. The veterinarian’s husband, Chirotosh Roy (53), who was at the wheels, has been arrested for rash driving, causing death due to negligence and causing grievous hurt among others. All offences are bailable. He will be produced in a Salt Lake court on Sunday, police said.. According to sources, the car was headed north along EM Bypass, possibly to the couple’s Salt Lake Sector I home from their Keyatala Road-based pet clinic and referral centre. The couple owns another such centre in Kankurgachhi. Though the car had a driver, it was Roy who was driving with the driver sitting next to him. Roy’s wife was in the rear seat. The signal was green when the car approached Chingrighata crossing. It turned yellow when the car tried to cross it. Police said Roy didn’t stop the car neither did he slow it down. Ahmed, on seeing the yellow signal, had just about pulled his cycle a few feet on the road — at the crossing with South Canal East Road, said witnesses. Roy first hit the ambulance ahead of his car and then swerved to where Ahmed and others were waiting for red signal. The car hit Ahmed and tried to take a U-turn abruptly. By then the signal had turned red and pedestrians had started crossing over. The car hit six others, including a woman, before getting stuck in a median curve. One of the pedestrians is said to be critical. “All seven injured persons were taken to hospital where one of them succumbed to death. We have arrested the driver and seized the offending vehicle. All legal formalities are in process,” said Surya Prasad Yadav, DC headquarters, Bidhannagar Commissionerate. Attempts to speak to the Roy family failed. It is learnt that the couple had been running their clinic and pet shops in south Kolkata and Kankurgachhi for several years. The couple in their late 40s are known faces among city’s pet lovers. A person who knows them said their cars are usually driven by drivers. A source said they were also not sure if Roy had just learnt driving. Police said the offending vehicle has been sent for forensic and mechanical tests. Bhola Das, who was treated for head injuries, said, “We saw the car hitting the ambulance first. All I remember after that was something hit me and police were taking me to hospital.” Arup Doloi, who was hit on his head and left leg, said, “More people could have been hit.” Inputs by Dwaipayan Ghosh, Tamaghna Banerjee, Mayukh Sengupta & Amit Moulick||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/speeding-car-mows-down-cyclist-injures-6-pedestrians-at-chingrighata/articleshow/87560004.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

In seven months, this is his second visit to the gurdwara in Faridkot district where on June 1, 2015, the first Bir of Guru Granth Sahib was stolen. The last visit was on Baisakhi. Sidhu spent 40 minutes talking to locals, telling them to pray for a kind of punishment to the desecrators "that will deter the sinners for generations". Gurdwara granthi Gora Singh said, “Sidhu spoke only about justice for sacrilege and asked us to pray for it. He wasn’t as frank as the last time.” On Friday, Sidhu told media in Chandigarh that though he had withdrawn his resignation, he’ll re-assume charge only when the advocate general was replaced and the UPSC (Union Public Service Commission) sent a panel of names for the appointment of DGP (director general of police). He took on his own party’s new government, seeking its last 50-odd days of action to catch the desecrators and drug peddlers. In Faridkot, gurdwara granthi Gora Singh said: “At 7.20am, I had just come to my adjacent home from the gurdwara when my children told me Navjot Singh Sidhu had landed there. I did not believe them until I saw a crowd outside. I returned to the gurdwara, to see him deep into prayer.” On November 8, the special investigation team (SIT) will visit Rohtak’s Sunaria Jail in Haryana to interrogate Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim about his connection to the theft of Bir from Faridkot’s Gurdwara Burj Jawahar Singh Wala. Expressing confidence in Sidhu's 2022 projection of 80 to 100 assembly seats for the Congress, Rajya Sabha member K T S Tulsi said: "Sidhu’s style of connecting with people will help the party in the elections. He’s a good orator." Sidhu said on Friday that: "I have no differences with chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi. In the last more than 4 years, I raised the issues of liquor and buses but the all-powerful last CM (Captain Amarinder Singh) took no action. I have no greed for any post. I only fight for Punjab’s rights." On September 28, he quit as state Congress president. Tulsi blamed the Bihar government for the 26 hooch-tragedy deaths in Bettiah, Gopalganj district, since Wednesday. He said: "Prohibition is not enough. It only promotes illicit liquor."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sidhu-revisits-sacrilege-at-1st-link-in-desecration-chain/articleshow/87560434.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Delhi||Centre must reduce fuel prices by Rs 15: Sisodia||New Delhi: Days after the Centre slashed excise duty on petrol and diesel, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Saturday said the AAP government is looking into steps it can take to provide more relief to the people. He, however, demanded that the central government should reduce the prices of these fuels by at least Rs 15 each, saying states have fewer resources. Sisodia was responding to the question whether the Delhi government was considering a reduction in Value Added Tax on diesel and petrol like other states. In the last three-four years, fuel prices have gone down across the globe but the central government did not let this happen in the county, he alleged. It kept increasing excise duty on globally reduced fuel prices, Sisodia added. “In the last few years, they have increased excise duty on fuel prices from Rs 15 per litre to Rs 34 per litre even as petrol (fuel) prices were going down. After reducing a few paisa on fuel prices, they are asking state governments to reduce (VAT). States already have less resources. “We are examining what impact it will have on Delhi and what Delhi (government) can do. But I request the central government to reduce petrol and diesel prices by at least Rs 15 each to give further relief to the public,” Sisodia said. The central government on Wednesday reduced excise duty by Rs 5 per litre on petrol and Rs 10 per litre on Diesel. Following the reduction in excise duty by the Centre, several state governments, including Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh among others, have slashed VAT rates on fuel. pti||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-must-reduce-fuel-prices-by-rs-15-sisodia/articleshow/87560442.cms||---

---||Trichy||Festival and long weekend hamper vax drive in Trichy||TRICHY: The festive week coupled with a long weekend has turned the vaccination drive in Trichy into a damp squib with at least 50% fall reported in the turnout at camps. Fearing that side-effects including fever and headache could hamper celebrations, residents seemed to have postponed their plans to take the jab. The hesitant population includes many who were eligible to take the second dose. Trichy corporation sources said there was a visible fall in the response for vaccination since a couple of days before Diwali (November 4). With around 900-1,200 people getting vaccinated on an average in each of the urban vaccination sites on normal days (excluding mass vaccination camps), the festive week saw patronage dip to 250-400 per site a day. Apart from the festival and long weekend plans involving travel to native towns, reopening of schools and rain were cited as other reasons for the fall in vaccination numbers. As schools have reopened, homemakers who are supposed to take their second dose are also postponing the jab. They believe that any side-effects will hamper their efforts in preparing children for school, health officials said. Anticipating such a poor response, Trichy city did not organise mass vaccination programme on Saturday. “The response was poor. Though we are focussing on covering the population eligible for second dose, they are not showing up. Even enquiries for vaccination locations have dwindled,” Dr A Mohammed Hakkim, urban vaccination coordinator, said. Of the 36 locations where vaccination camps were held on Saturday, most sites returned half of the vials handed over to them. Only about 600 people were vaccinated per camp.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/festival-and-long-weekend-hamper-vax-drive-in-trichy/articleshow/87560441.cms||Deepak Karthik

Police personnel including officers covered 64,539 houses in 1,601 villages in Trichy, Karur, Pudukottai, Ariyalur, Perambalur, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam and Mayiladuthurai districts from November 1 to 5, said inspector general of police (IGP) V Balakrishnan. They distributed pamphlets carrying messages on how to protect children from sexual offences and who could be the perpetrators, among other things. The cops told family members not to leave children alone at home. Citing various incidents, they pointed out how even known people sexually abused children. Public were asked to contact emergency helplines 100 (police), 181 (one stop centre), 1091 (women help desk) and 1098 (Childline helpline), if they come across such offences. The drive will be carried out till November 14. Balakrishnan said the campaign was primarily aimed at creating awareness among parents about sexual offences against children. “Though we create awareness among the people regularly, there is a need to intensify the exercise because such incidences keep recurring, which is disturbing. We believe this effort will bring about change to a great extent,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/central-zone-police-launch-doorstep-awareness-campaign-on-child-sex-abuse/articleshow/87560431.cms||---

The workers were led by party president Sukhbir Singh Badal, who has condemned the “unprovoked attack on the peacefully protesting workers.” Badal claimed the lathicharge was part of a conspiracy to prevent people from raising their voice against the corrupt Congress government, which was indulging in open loot and plunder of state resources. He also demanded that false case must be withdrawn immediately, besides calling for a probe into the unprovoked attack on Akali workers. Earlier, Badal courted arrested along with senior party leaders and workers, and announced the party’s resolve to continue to protest peacefully until the grievances of the farmers as well as the common man are resolved. He said the voice of the people could not be throttled with sticks and that Punjabis had never tolerated tyranny and would give a befitting response to the gang of ‘lutere (thieves)’ who were ruling the state at present. Earlier, Akali workers in thousands held a march from the MLA flats to the CM’s residence and broke police barriers to reach the chief minister’s residence. Holding up placards and raising slogans of “Narma da muawafza jaari karo”and“Petrol Diesel sasta karo, Annadaata te reham karo,” the Akali workers also demanded registration of a case against the Gandhi family in the 1984 genocide case besides demanding an end to the protection being given to the massacre perpetrators like Jagdish Tytler. During an interaction with the media, Badal asked the chief minister to stop photo-ops and start performing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/akali-workers-attempt-to-gherao-cm-residence-several-injured-in-lathicharge/articleshow/87560446.cms||---
---||Delhi||In rare surgery, AIIMS could save baby, not parasitic twin||NEW DELHI: A 25-year-old woman from Haryana recently gave birth to twins at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, but one of them had only the neck and head and no limbs. It was also attached to the fully developed twin’s stomach. An emergency surgery was carried out just after the birth of the twins to separate them. While the parasitic twin didn’t survive, doctors managed to save the other baby. “He is recovering well and we are planning to discharge him soon,” a doctor said. A parasitic twin is an identical twin that has stopped developing during the pregnancy and is physically attached to the fully developing twin. The doctors faced a big challenge. The fully developed baby had all organs except the intestines. His intestine was in a sac that was protruding into the parasitic twin’s neck. Sharma said the first thing they did after the delivery was to put the intestines of the fully developed baby back into his stomach. “This was possible because a newborn baby has a very small intestine which isn’t yet inflated with air. It was, thus, possible to squeeze all the intestinal loops into the underdeveloped stomach of the normal baby,” she added. Dr Shilpa Sharma, additional professor, paediatric surgery, AIIMS, told TOI that the mother of the twins came in the seventh month of pregnancy when imaging tests during routine check-ups revealed the possibility of parasitic twins. Foetal MRI at the institute confirmed this. However, the doctors waited for two months so the fully developed baby attained maturity before attempting delivery. “The woman was admitted to AIIMS on October 26 and the babies were delivered three days later via Caesarean section. The parasitic twin’s heartbeat was very feeble at the time of delivery and the brain was filled with fluid. We were sure it would survive and so focused on saving the fully developed baby,” Sharma disclosed. The twins were taken into the operation theatre where a team of doctors and nurses were already prepared for the process to separate the two babies. The separation surgery involved exploring the connection between the two twins and dividing the communicating blood vessels carefully. It took nearly one hour. After that, the abdomen of the surviving baby was repaired and he was kept on a ventilator for a day. “The fully developed baby has recovered well and is likely to lead a normal life,” a team member said. The doctors stressed on the need for regular pre-delivery check-ups so that complications such as the development of a parasitic twin can be picked up early. Timely intervention can help save lives, the doctors said. In 2017, the neurosurgery department of AIIMS had managed a miracle of sorts by separating conjoined twin from Odisha who were joined at the head. They shared the vein carrying blood back from the brain to the heart. One of the twins died last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-rare-surgery-aiims-could-save-baby-not-parasitic-twin/articleshow/87560451.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Swampy residential roads leading to many houses have become virtually inaccessible for vehicles. Roads dug up for underground drainage projects near Khajamalai and Kattur have turned marshlands post the recent rain, making it a risky ride for residents and visitors to houses. The neighbourhoods of Khajamalai and Kattur in Ponmalai and Ariyamangalam zones of the city have been witnessing UGD pipeline installation work for about a year now. UGD work has been going on at RS Puram in Khajamalai, which has been with the civic body for the past 25 years, since March. Although a portion of work was completed on the stretch, the corporation has not properly repaired roads and compacted the UGD pits scientifically. The rains have made the pits loose and swampy. In the past two days, two cars were stuck on the road, requiring help from recovery vehicles to retrieve them from the pits. “Residents have paid about Rs 2,000 for the recovery vehicle, but even the vehicle that came to rescue suffered big time in accessing the poor roads. The slow pace of UGD work and poor workmanship in maintaining the roads are costing our peace,” Shabeer Hussain, a resident of RS Puram, said. Residents said that while localities such as RS Puram and Anbil Nagar near KK Nagar have expensive public parks established at a cost of over Rs 50 lakh, roads in the neighbourhoods remain worse. Although Trichy corporation claimed that maintenance work was carried out after complaints surfaced, the residents termed the repair an eyewash as the civic body failed to address their grievance scientifically. Ironically, a heavy vehicle that came to dump gravel on the damaged road at the behest of the corporation got stuck too. Residents of Gokul Nagar, Amman Nagar and other parts of Kattur say that they will get stranded in the event of continuous rain. “We have been taking up temporary restoration work and the process will be completed soon. Localities where UGD work is completed will get new roads under TURIF fund,” an official source with Trichy corporation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-roads-turn-into-marshlands/articleshow/87560444.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Trichy||Avoid paddy stagnating in DPCs: V K Sasikala||TRICHY: Alleging lapses in paddy procurement in the delta districts, expelled AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala has urged the state government to streamline the procurement process. She alleged that paddy procured was stagnating at direct procurement centres (DPCs) in the delta districts and farmers were yet to be disbursed the assured procurement price. In a statement identifying herself as AIADMK general secretary, Sasikala said people in Thanjavur have conveyed to her that paddy procurement is not happening in the delta districts. As a result, the recent rain damaged the harvested and stagnant paddy. “Farmers have suffered losses to the tune of Rs 20,000 per acre. As the procured paddy stagnated in DPCs, farmers are forced to store harvested paddy in unsafe environment. Rain eventually makes the paddy sprout,” she said in a statement. Such damaged paddy was not procured by the state-run DPCS, she added. Sasikala also claimed that people had told her that government officials are urging farmers to cultivate alternative crops instead of paddy. This would only make the farmers suffer more monetary loss, she added. “Citing excess moisture content, DPCs are not procuring paddy from farmers. During Puratchi Thalaivi’s (J Jayalalithaa’s) tenure, even paddy with high moisture content was procured,” she claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/avoid-paddy-stagnating-in-dpcs-sasikala/articleshow/87560447.cms||---

Subhajit Sur, an engineering graduate, died before cops and locals could rush him to a nearby hospital. He had promised his elder sister Suparna that he would head to her Mukundapur home for Bhai Phonta after completing his uncle’s cashless claims. Subhajit, who stayed in Garia’s Sahapara, had taken out his bike — WB01AQ-6196 — telling his elderly parents that he would be back after visiting his sister’s home. As Subhajit was coming down the north-bound flank, a private bus plying on the Garia Station-Baghbazar route hit him from behind. The impact hurled Subhajit on the road and he was mowed down by the bus. The bus driver refused to stop the vehicle, and according to witnesses, he then jumped off the running bus to flee. So did the conductor. Witnesses also claimed that the bus had around 50 people in it. One of the passengers panicked and tried to jump out of the moving bus. This passenger, who could not be identified, was injured. So were a few others. Then one passenger headed to the cabin, took the driver’s seat, and applied the brakes to stop the moving bus. By then the bus had travelled several hundred metres mowing down Subhajit completely. A local, who witnessed the incident, said, “It could have been a bigger disaster hadn’t one passenger stopped the moving bus.” Police and locals immediately ran towards the spot and tried to rush Subhajit to the Peerless Hospital but he didn’t survive the fatal crash. Suparna, who reached the hospital only to see her brother’s body, said: “He had promised me he would take Bhai Phonta from me. I was waiting for him. Our lives have ended with him.” Suparna was married a year-and-a-half ago but has been the family’s backbone helping Subhajit to complete his engineering studies after their father, Sudhanshu Sur, retired as a KMC employee. . Subhajit, who had got a job recently, was the family’s only earning member. Survey Park police arrested the conductor. But the driver is absconding. The Cossipore-based bus owner is also being questioned. Police said they were scanning CCTV footages to understand if the driver could be charged with culpable homicide. The bus and Subhajit’s bike will undergo forensic and mechanical tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bus-crushes-biker-in-bagha-jatin-driver-jumps-off-running-vehicle/articleshow/87560009.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: NCB sends SIT to take over Aryan Khan case, 5 other probes||MUMBAI: The newly formed special investigation team (SIT) of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) operation unit arrived in Mumbai on Saturday, a day after it took over six cases, including the cruise drug bust case involving actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan being investigated by the Mumbai unit of the agency headed by Sameer Wankhede. A press release by the NCB said that this has been done on “administrative grounds” and no one has been removed from any case. Wankhede, who has been heading the Aryan Khan probe, also said he has not been removed from the case. The SIT headed by IPS officer Sanjay Singh told the media that his team would take assistance from the Mumbai unit. Singh, a 1996 batch Odisha cadre IPS officer posted as deputy director general (operations unit) in NCB’s Delhi office, arrived in Mumbai with his team and went to the NCB office in Ballard Estate. The six cases taken over by the SIT are the case of Aryan Khan, actor Armaan Kohli’s arrest, state minister Nawab Malik’s son in-law Sameer Khan’s case, and three other drugs cases where the accused were caught from Mumbra, Jogeshwari and Dongri.  Singh and Wankhede visited the Cordellia cruise for investigation in the afternoon. The SIT was formed on Friday. The NCB said the SIT will take over six cases which it said have “national and international ramifications”. Malik had alleged that the case of drug bust on the cruise was a fake one and released images of witnesses accompanying Aryan Khan to the NCB office and taking selfies with Khan. One of the witnesses was a BJP worker and another one, K P Gosavi, was a criminal, he had alleged. Gosavi, who was wanted in several cases, was subsequently arrested by the Pune police in a cheating case. Later, one of the witnesses, Prabhakar Sail, in an affidavit alleged discussion of pay-offs to be made to an NCB official, besides a meeting with Shah Rukh Khan’s manager, Pooja Dadlani, where money exchanged hands. Another witness, Sam D’Souza, whose name figured in Sail’s affidavit, said that Rs 50 lakh was collected from Dadlani but it was returned after he realised that Gosavi was a cheat. The state formed an SIT to probe the allegations of extortion. Wankhede denied the charges of extortion. There were reports that an NCB vigilance team will visit Mumbai on Monday for the probe into the cruise drugs case. The vigilance team had earlier visited Mumbai on October 24 and left for New Delhi. Malik had said that he got an anonymous letter and sent it to the NCB’s top brass. The writer, who claimed to be working at the NCB office, cited 26 cases and claimed that several people in these cases were falsely framed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ncb-sends-sit-to-take-over-aryan-case-5-other-probes/articleshow/87560460.cms||---

The programme has shown good impact in terms of increasing ground water table, vegetation and plantation, besides providing livelihood to the landless poor, said Dr CP Reddy, senior additional commissioner at department of land resources in Union rural development ministry, after a review meeting of the scheme with officials from panchayat raj and rural development department on Saturday. The programme included injection wells and greening of hillocks to increase ground water table and rejuvenation of vegetation on barren hillocks. Dr Reddy, who is on a review mission to study the watershed programme and digitisation of land records in the state, said AP has been doing well in the watershed development component of the Prime Minister Krishi Sinchayee Yojana. “The state was given 373 projects with a financial outlay of Rs 1,704.58 crore under the programme, out of which it has executed 261 projects spending Rs 1,622.93 crore,” he said, while adding that 95 per cent of the works were completed successfully. “The central government has asked AP to complete the balance 112 projects spending Rs 69.74 crore by March 2022. These projects were targeted to bring 15.48 lakh hectares under cultivation in the state.” He further said that department of land resources is now holding reviews of the programme in all states with the respective implementing agencies. “The land resources department is planning to launch new generation of watersheds targeting 5 million hectares of degraded lands across the country to be converted into cultivable lands. The new project would have modified guidelines and enhanced cost norms,” he added. Watershed programme joint commissioner B Janardhan Reddy presented the proposal for coverage of 10 lakh hectares of degraded land for the next level of the scheme, to be launched by the Union government. He said the state has 70 lakh hectares of degraded land to be covered and wanted the Centre to consider the proposal. Dr Reddy also visited the department of survey, settlement and land records in the city and held a meeting with officials. He also visited the tehsildar’s office at Penamaluru to verify the digitalisation of land records. He was informed that all land records would be computerised and information would be made available online in all sub-registrar offices. The data would be stored in two different places to protect it from any devastation or accident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/watershed-moment-for-ap-in-green-drive/articleshow/87559342.cms||Gopi Dara

The incident took place in Uttar Pradesh's Rampur and an FIR was lodged based on her husband's complaint. At least nine others have been arrested by the UP police so far for celebrating Pakistan's victory against India. However, unlike the others, the woman was not charged with sedition. The husband had lodged a police complaint against his wife on October 29. After pressure was exerted by a right-wing group, an FIR was finally registered under section 153a (promoting enmity) of the IPC, along with section 67 of the IT Act. The couple was married nearly four months ago. This incident was reported from a village under the jurisdiction of Azim Nagar police station and the complaint was lodged at the Ganj police station by one Ishaan Miyan, against his wife, Rabia Shamsi. After the station house officer refused to register an FIR, Ishaan approached the superintendent of police, Ankit Mittal, along with the screenshots of the social media statuses of his wife. Thereafter, an investigation was ordered and Rabia’s statement was recorded by police. The FIR was registered against Rabia on Friday night after the initial investigation. Rabia says that her phone was used by her nephew who she alleges uploaded the pictures. She said that she was unaware of the fact. She is currently living with her parents and had earlier registered an FIR against her husband for domestic violence. Superintendent of police of Rampur, Ankit Mittal, told TOI, “On November 4, a complaint was lodged by Ishaani against his wife Rabia, who had celebrated Pakistan’s victory over India and used abusive language against Indian players, along with sharing objectionable pictures on her social media account. After the initial investigation, an FIR has been registered. We are not going to arrest her as of now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/wife-booked-for-celebrating-pak-win-over-india-on-basis-of-estranged-husbands-complaint/articleshow/87559340.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

He demanded interference of the state governor to check disruptions in the working of the constitutional offices by political leaders. Raising issue of Punjab advocate general APS Deol of charging Punjab Congress president Navjot Sidhu of interfering and scuttling the working of the AG office, Chugh said the infighting in the Congress has brought the state to the brink where drug mafias, sand mafias and liquor mafias were controlling it. He said Sidhu was indulging in gross breach of constitutional norms by interfering in the working of the state government. “Sidhu is making political capital out of the incidents of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib, which is unfortunate and reprehensible,” he said, while asserting that the Congress had been playing politics on the issue instead of punishing the culprits. Chugh said the Congress high command had ensured that Punjab goes to dumps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bjp-gen-secy-says-cong-taking-punjab-to-dumps/articleshow/87560455.cms||---

A video purportedly showing Milki with a weapon amid a crowd at the panchayat has gone viral.

---||Delhi||Delhi govt okays plan to cover all naked electricity wires under its new policy||NEW DELHI: The Delhi cabinet approved a policy to convert the 2,264-km of the bare 11kV wire network in the city to an insulated one, mainly to prevent the risks inherent in bare electricity wires. On Saturday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal instructed the departments concerned to implement the policy. Delhi government is also working on putting the power wires underground. After the cabinet approved the policy to convert the 11kV bare conductors to insulated ones, the CM said that uninsulated power wires hanging over the streets marred the look of Delhi and posed a threat to life and property. The policy, presented to the cabinet by the power department, was unanimously approved in consideration of the safety of life and property of Delhiites. “It is the state government’s duty to provide safety as well as facilities to the people of Delhi at every level. Therefore, this policy has been cleared to prevent the danger to life and property that bare conductors pose. Converting the bare conductors to insulated ones will also bring about a monumental change in the supply infrastructure,” said the CM. Kejriwal added that Delhi government was working on putting the electric wires underground. “This will make them completely safe and prevent accidents,” he said. In August 2018, the power department had been empowered to shift high-tension (11kV, 33kV and 66kV) and low-tension (400V) power transmission lines underground. In March 2020, the cabinet had discussed the 'Jagmagati Delhi' project and directed the power distribution companies to submit a proposal to insulate the entire network of bare transmission wires. The 11kV network is maintained by the three distribution companies, or discoms, namely TPDDL, BRPL and BYPL. Of the 2,264 km of the network, TPDDL will insulate 1,270 km, BYPL 29km and BRPL, 965 km. The finance department provided the power department Rs 25 crore in the 2021-22 financial year for the conversion under the Jagmagati Delhi programme. The areas where the 11 kV bare conductors are to be converted to an insulated network have been identified by the power department. These include regularised as well as unauthorised colonies, urbanised villages, resettlement colonies and colonies established under the 20-point programme in rural areas or in rural localities, such as in lal dora and extended lal dora areas. Unauthorised colonies with the name and registration number and other property details of the respective revenue village or areas through which the 11 kV bare conductor passes are also included in the exercise under the new policy. The power department will now issue sanction letters to the discoms to carry out the proposed work in their respective jurisdictions. The companies will obtain permission from the departments concerned, if necessary, for the conversion project. Delhi Transco Limited will submit the verification inspection report with photographs before and after completion of the project and certify whether the work has been carried out as per the prescribed norms, terms and conditions. The money spent on the work will be released to the power distribution companies on completion of the conversion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-okays-plan-to-cover-all-naked-electricity-wires-under-its-new-policy/articleshow/87560462.cms||AlokKNMishra

He alleged that Patil was deployed by state ministers to defame the NCB and one of its officers. “Sunil Patil has been associated with NCP for the last 20 years, since its founding days. He is a friend of ex-home minister Anil Deshmukh’s son Hrishikesh and is linked to many NCP leaders and ministers. He is close to these leaders and is like a family member to them. Sunil Patil and Sam D’Souza had a WhatsApp conversation about the cruise drugs party. Sunil Patil is also involved in Anil Deshmukh’s ED case. ... It was said that Kiran Gosavi was a BJP worker.

---||Nagpur||To cope with weekend rush, private buses roped in for Gorewada safari||Nagpur: The ongoing festive season and vacations for kids has led to an increase in visitors at the Gorewada zoo safari, forcing authorities to rope in private buses to handle the load. This Saturday and Sunday, at least two private buses will join the existing fleet owned by Gorewada to ferry people in the safari zone. Divisional manager Pramod Panchbhai, who oversees the Balasahebh Thackeray International Zoological Park, said, “I’m currently on leave so can’t tell you the tourist load for today, but yes on a trial basis we have got private buses on board just for the weekend. We have an existing fleet of five buses, which includes a canter. While our buses have a carrying capacity of 38 each, on weekends, there is a sharp increase in the number of visitors.” An employee at the zoo, who did not wish to be identified, confirmed that weekends were indeed busy. “We are turning back visitors, it’s that busy. It’s probably to do with the Diwali vacations as many people would have relatives visiting them. So the best place to go with family is of course the safari. Today, we have a big bus and Temo Traveller which accommodates around 15-20 people brought in through a private contractor,” said the employee. Officials say increase in the number of visitors in Gorewada does not breach any ‘carrying capacity’ rule. Panchbhai said, “This is a zoo. So, unlike TATR or Pench, we do not have any cap on visitors. Our infrastructure is more than well equipped to handle around a thousand visitors per day.” However, some employees did raise a concern over safety issues with private buses. “These buses have windows that can be opened, and that’s unsafe in the carnivore section. The Tempo Traveller is like a mini bus, so its windows are more easily accessible to animals. Our fear is that some eager visitor may open the window for a better photograph and risk his life,” said the employee. Panchbhai says that while the concern is genuine, it won’t be a factor at Gorewada. “Each bus has a guide, so visitors are monitored. Our staff will ensure complete compliance with all safety norms before the safari starts,” said Panchbhai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/to-cope-with-weekend-rush-private-buses-roped-in-for-gorewada-safari/articleshow/87560035.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Delhi||Married now, parties want to drop POCSO case, Delhi HC seeks police stand||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court has sought the stand of the prosecution on a plea seeking quashing of a case registered under the IPC section for rape and the stringent Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. The plea argues that the parties have settled the case since on attaining the age of majority, the woman married the accused and they both are now living as husband and wife. Justice Mukta Gupta asked the state to file a reply before the next date of hearing and listed the matter for February 11, 2022, for further hearing. The plea stated that the parties have settled the dispute and the two were earlier in a relationship, which they have converted into marriage. “Both are majors and are now living as husband and wife and thus, in terms of the decision of the Supreme Court, the FIR and the proceedings pursuant thereto be quashed,” the counsel stated, urging the court to quash the FIR lodged on March 29, 2017, registered at police station Ranjit Nagar under the charges dealing with rape and section 6 of POCSO Act. According to the petition, the complainant/prosecutrix was a minor aged 16 years when the FIR was lodged and she was deeply in love with the petitioner. The petition further added that for some miscommunication, misinformation and ill-advice, she lodged a complaint in an attempt to secure her relationship and marriage. The petitioner was arrested in the present case on July 2, 2018, and while being in custody, was granted interim bail for a period of 14 days in order to enable both the parties to marry each other. “They subsequently got married on December 10, 2019 at Arya Samaj Vedic Trust whereafter the petitioner was granted regular bail. While the petitioner and respondent are leading a marital life, the trial in the aforementioned case is acting as a thorn and stopping it from making it a ‘Happily ever after’ case,” the petition submitted. The petitioner and the complainant, who are husband and wife, have also signed a mutual agreement for the purpose of the present quashing on August 13, 2021, which is titled a joint Affidavit cum Agreement, the petition further informed the court, seeking its intervention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/married-now-parties-want-to-drop-pocso-case-hc-seeks-police-stand/articleshow/87560471.cms||---
---||Delhi||Chhath Puja: BJP, AAP continue to spar over festival||NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party and BJP on Saturday sparred over Chhath celebrations in the capital. AAP MLA Sanjeev Jha claimed that BJP was behind the Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s decision to ban Chhath celebrations on the Yamuna banks. MLA Somnath Bharti alleged that the BJP used police to stop Chhath ghat preparations in his constituency. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a tweet stated that creating hurdles in Chhath Puja preparations is wrong. “Together we should organise it, and together we should worship Chhati Maiya. Then only we will succeed,” Kejriwal tweeted. In a press conference, MLA Jha said: “Through DDMA, BJP has banned Chhath Puja celebrations on the Yamuna banks where lakhs of devotees perform the puja every year. We have written a letter about it to the LG. It is easy to follow Covid protocols on the riverbanks because of adequate space.” The MLA claimed that police stopped the digging work on a DDA land in Bawana where the locals were preparing for Chhath Puja. “In Dwarka, a land belonging to the municipal corporation was supposed to host Chhath Puja celebrations. However, the mayor has stated that no celebrations will be held there. At this place, Chhath celebrations are being organised for the past 30 years,” said AAP MLA Vinay Mishra. AAP MLA Somnath Bharti claimed that some people stopped Chhath ghat preparations in a park under his constituency. He blamed the BJP for it. “MLA Vinay Mishra and AAP workers are sitting on dharna in Dwarka after Chhath ghat preparations were halted. Last time in GK also, we sat on dharna. In Delhi, the people of Purvanchal community are being insulted by the BJP,” Bharti claimed. Delhi BJP functionaries, however, alleged that the AAP functionaries were lying. “The DDMA’s decision about the ban was taken in meetings where CM Arvind Kejriwal was also present. It exposed AAP before the people. Rattled over it, AAP is now trying to create tension in the capital,” BJP’s Dinesh Pratap Singh claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/chhath-puja-bjp-aap-continue-to-spar-over-festival/articleshow/87560482.cms||---

The accused, identified as one Jatin, has been arrested and a probe has been ordered, police said. The incident took place in Kashiram Nagar under Majhola police limits of Moradabad on November 2. The deceased’s family informed police that they weren’t initially aware of the harassment, and she informed her parents about the accused after it became a regular occurrence. According to the family, on the night of November 2, the girl went to the terrace and tried to kill herself. Police said the girl was taken to the hospital where doctors had declared her condition as critical. The girl, who had sustained multiple fractures on her body, succumbed to her injuries on Thursday, police added. On Saturday, Majhola SHO, Jeet Singh, said, “The accused was troubling the girl while on her way to school which may have forced her to take the extreme step. We are investigating the matter and statements by the girl’s family will be recorded. A postmortem has been conducted and the accused has been arrested and booked under various IPC sections.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/class-x-student-jumps-from-her-terrace-and-kills-self-after-being-harassed-by-local-man/articleshow/87559395.cms||Maria Khan
---||Vijayawada||TDP neta Kodela Sivaram placed under house arrest||Vijayawada: TDP leader Kodela Sivaram was placed under house arrest ahead of his planned ‘Chandranna Asaya Sadhana’ rally at Sattenapalli town in Guntur district on Saturday. According to police sources, no permission was granted for the rally and the decision to place Sivaram under house arrest was taken to maintain law and order. Sivaram sat in protest for six hours against the police move to put him under house arrest. Speaking to the media, Sivaram said the government failed to carry out development work in Sattenapalli during the last thirty months. “The Kondamodu-Perecherla road widening work which would have benefited many families is yet to be completed. When my father (Kodela Sivaprasad) was the MLA, the then chief minister Chandrababu Naidu laid the foundation stone for many development works in Sattanapalli,” Sivaram said. He criticised the YSRC government for ‘forgetting’ development. Sivaram called for a walkathon from Rajupalem to Devarampadu village. After permission was denied for the march, Sivaram said the rally will take place at any cost. Meanwhile, police also placed several other TDP leaders including Anchula Narasimha Rao under house arrest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/tdp-neta-kodela-sivaram-placed-under-house-arrest/articleshow/87559398.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Sameer Wankhede’s father in HC with defamation suit against Malik||MUMBAI: The father of NCB officer Sameer Wankhede has moved the Bombay high court with a suit against state minorities development minister Nawab Malik for defaming his family. He has sought Rs 1.25 crore compensation from Malik. The matter was mentioned urgently before Justice Shahrukh Kathawalla on Friday by advocate Arshad Shaikh to grant permission to Dhyandev Wankhede (72) to file the suit during the court vacation and to hear the matter for interim relief on Monday. Shaikh submitted that Malik has been calling the Wankhede family “fraud and questioning their religious beliefs saying they are not Hindus”. He said Malik is destroying the practice of his daughter Yasmin, who is a criminal lawyer who does not appear in narcotics cases. “He is calling everybody (in the Wankhede family) a fraud. Literally on a daily basis,’’ said Shaikh. He said Malik’s son-in-law was arrested in February and was out on bail in September. This was challenged by NCB and is pending in the high court. Shaikh said Malik wants to get back at Sameer and, therefore, is defaming the family. Shaikh said Malik has relied on WhatsApp chats of a goon known to him to show that Yasmin had links with drug traffickers. “This goon contacts her for her visiting card... the screen shot which is distributed,” he said, adding that “every single day he (Malik) says something”. In his order, Justice Kathawalla said: “Leave to file the above suit is granted. Stand over to November 8, 2021.” Wankhede's petition has urged the high court to declare that Malik’s “remarks, insinuations and/or imputation, whether in writing or oral, stated by him” in press releases or interviews or social media including but not limited to his Twitter account and his family members, are “tortious and defamatory in nature”. He wants a permanent injunction restraining Malik, his party members and all others acting under or on his instructions from publishing, writing or speaking in the media or publishing in any manner defamatory material about him and his family members. As interim relief, he seeks deletion of articles, tweets, interviews, including in electronic and social media. Also, pending hearing and final disposal of the suit, a temporary injunction restraining them “from publishing, writing and speaking in any media”. Wankhede sought direction to Malik to pay him Rs 1.25 crore as compensation for the “irreparable loss, damage, harm, prejudice to the name, character, reputation and societal image of plaintiff and his family members”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-wankhedes-father-in-hc-with-defamation-suit-against-malik/articleshow/87560493.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Nagpur||Ex-home minister Anil Deshmukh’s supporters observe ‘Black Diwali’ at 18 places||NAGPUR: Supporters of former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on Friday observed ‘Kali (black) Diwali’ and staged ‘rasta roko’ (traffic blockade) at 18 places in Katol assembly constituency to protest the senior NCP leader’s arrest by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) earlier this week in a money laundering case. According to party colleagues, there is a sympathy wave across the constituency for Deshmukh and his family. The agitations and solidarity drives like ‘Aamhi sahebanchya sobat’ (am by the side of the leader) had started immediately after former Mumbai CP Param Bir Singh stated before a one-member committee that he had no other additional proof apart from the first letter of complaint against the minister. The protest is gradually intensifying in the constituency represented by the ex-minister five times. According to party colleagues, Deshmukh had planned several development works for Nagpur district that would have boosted Vidarbha’s economy but “those projects have no future now”. It’s learnt, Deshmukh loyalists at around 70 panchayat samitis in Katol taluka and two municipal councils at Narkhed and Mowad too had participated in the protests. According to Narkhed town NCP president Sanjay Charde, this was the first time in more than three decades when “Saheb” was not present at his native place Wadwihira in Narkhed taluka for Diwali. “We wore black badges and participated in demonstration at Gandhi Chowk and Vyapari line in Narkhed against the harassment meted out to our leader ( Deshmukh) and his family members by central agencies like ED, CBI and I-T department at the behest of BJP,” he said. "The development activities which was initiated by our minister now are on the backburners. After all, Vidarbha and especially Nagpur region felt the brunt of the injustice meted out to Deshmukh and his family," said Charde. In Katol, the agitation had kicked-started on the next day of Deshmukh’s arrest. According to former vice-president of Katol Panchayat Samiti, Anup Kharade, protests were held at 58 villages, followed by similar agitation in another 33 villages. “People from at least 20 villages joined the ‘Aamhi sahebanchya sobat' drive in Katol taluka,” said Kharade. “With due respect for the courts and the agencies, this type of politically motivated witch-hunting shows our democracy in poor light,” said Kharade while warning that the agitation will intensify soon. Narkhed’s NCP leader Arsade said that at Jalalkheda, Bharsingi, Belona, Devgram, Sawargaon, Bishnoor and other smaller villages demonstrations were staged at local level. “The protests were peaceful. Social media platform was used extensively,” said the NCP leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ex-hm-deshmukhs-supporters-observe-black-diwali-at-18-places/articleshow/87560052.cms||Soumitra Bose

We are taking care of communication logistics on behalf of the collectorate in this pilot project. The movement of the notices will be very fast from now on. In the near future, we will also try to take up all communication and correspondence of the collectorate,” Jakhere said. Prior to this, the notices were sometimes issued without registered post, owing to which the movement of the notice to distant areas could not be tracked. The new process will enable the collectorate to use the speed post’s network to track the same with accuracy, making the work efficient.

Similarly, organizers of big-budget Pujas in south and central Kolkata — including Bhowanipore, Kalighat, Chetla, Janbazar and Entally — will choose Bajekadamtolla Ghat (Babughat). According to a KMC parks and squares department official, they were expecting over 2,000 idols at different ghats along the Hooghly on Sunday. Besides, there are 15 major ponds in Behala, Tollygunge-Jadavpur belt and along EM Bypass where idols from neighbourhoods will get immersed.

We have taken all sorts of preparations that will ensure a smooth immersion keeping the Covid protocols in tact,” a KMC parks and squares department official said. On the first day of immersion, around 1000 Kali idols were taken to different ghats along the Hooghly.

The latter distracted the reptile by throwing stones at it and managed to pull out his sibling from its jaws in the nick of time. The attack took place in Pilibhit district’s Madhotanda area. Vikas along with his brother, Neeraj, 16, was washing his hands at an irrigation canal after working in the farmland on Friday, when he suddenly felt a tug on his right leg. To his horror, he found himself being dragged towards the canal by the crocodile. He started screaming, resisting the crocodile but was no match for its strength. Neeraj picked up a big stone and threw it at the mugger. Distracted, it let go of Vikas and slipped into the canal, swimming away swiftly. Vikas was taken to the local community centre, where his condition is stated to be stable. Later, Neeraj told forest officials that the crocodile was basking in the sun near the irrigation canal and the duo failed to notice it. An unsuspecting Vikas ventured too close to the mugger and was attacked. Gaurav Vishnoi, SHO Madthotanda police station, said, “The victim was not expecting the presence of a crocodile in the canal which is why he was not careful.” In July, two children were killed in a crocodile attack while five people were injured in attacks over the past one year in the district. The locals have been advised by the forest department to stay alert while working near the irrigation canals. During the monsoon season, crocodiles in the flooded rivers swim into irrigation canals. The forest department has put up signboards near human habitats, cautioning people against attacks by crocodiles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/brother-pulls-out-elder-sibling-from-crocs-jaws-in-pilibhit/articleshow/87559408.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Nawab says he sought SIT inquiry, will open secrets of ‘private army’||MUMBAI: A day after the NCB entrusted the investigation against Aryan Khan to a high-level team led by a deputy director general, NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said he had demanded an SIT investigation against zonal director Sameer Wankhede for kidnapping and making ransom demands from megastar Shah Rukh Khan’s son. Now, there will be two SITs, one by the state government, in which Malik is a minister, and the other by NCB. “Let us see who brings out the skeletons from the closet of Wankhede and exposes him and his nefarious private army. I will be disclosing the hidden secrets of Hotel Lalit as well as the private army on Sunday,” Nawab Malik said. According to reports, Malik is likely to display CCTV footage showing a section of witnesses involved in the Aryan Khan case. In the case, it was found that the main witness, Kiran Gosavi, was a criminal and wanted in at least four cases of cheating. Currently, he is in custody of the Pune police. Another witness, Vilas Bhanushali, is a BJP activist, while yet another witness, Prabhakar Sail, has filed an affidavit against Gosavi and a few other witnesses. Apparently, alarmed by the stringent criticism of the NCB over the manner in which it handled the Aryan Khan case, the NCB on Friday set up a high-level team led by DDG Sanjay Singh to take over six cases, including the Aryan Khan case from the Mumbai unit, which have national and international ramifications, in order to conduct deeper investigation. Wankhede was investigating the Aryan Khan case. In the wake of reports that he has been removed, the NCB made it clear that no officer or officers have been removed from their present roles and they will continue to assist the operations branch investigation as required. “I have not been removed from investigation, it was my writ petition that the case be probed by a central agency, CBI or NIA. Now the Aryan Khan and Sameer Khan cases are being probed by Delhi’s NCB SIT,” Wankhede said. Malik said now that Wankhede has been “removed” from half a dozen cases, all the 26 cases registered in the recent past must be entrusted to the new SIT. A week ago, Malik had handed over a list of 26 cases to the NCB director general. Malik’s contention was that the raid on the cruise ship on October 2 was fake. Malik reiterated that his campaign will come to an end the day Wankhede loses his job for securing it on the basis of a forged caste certificate. Malik’s contention is that while Wankhede is a Muslim, he has secured the prestigious job under the Scheduled Caste category on the basis of a forged caste certificate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nawab-says-he-sought-sit-inquiry-will-open-secrets-of-private-army/articleshow/87560501.cms||---

The situation is also dangerous as the concrete layers of the slab under which the tombs of Alluri and his follower Gam Gantam Dora are situated are flaking away. The state and Central governments are planning to set up museums and memorial structures of Alluri Seeta Rama Raju at various places including Lammasingi and Visakhapatnam city but it seems they have forgotten the real place where Alluri fought the British. Authorities are neglecting the memorial structures where Alluri waged armed struggle including Mampa, Rajendrapalem in Koyyuru mandal, and Krishna Devi Peta in Golugonda mandal in Visakhapatnam district. The Krishna Devi Peta Alluri Park is the only one among the Alluri memorial structures that attracts tourists. So it is high time that people’s representatives in the district took steps for the comprehensive development of the park. Concrete layers of the ceiling of the tombs came off a couple of days ago. It may be recalled that the ceiling of the museum at the park collapsed a few months ago. Even after that, the authorities have not taken any steps to repair it, locals alleged. National Alluri Seeta Rama Raju Yuvajana Sangham founder president Padala Veerabhadra Rao demanded that the government focus on it and make necessary arrangements for the facelift of the park.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/memories-of-freedom-fighter-alluri-lose-battle-to-government-apathy/articleshow/87559418.cms||Siva G
---||Goa||Heavy tourist flow, festive weekend rush lead to traffic jams across Goa||PANAJI: Due to heavy tourist rush over the Diwali weekend, several stretches of the highways as well as state roads saw traffic jams throughout Saturday. Around noon, serpentine queue of vehicles was seen on Northern side of the Zuari bridge, as an unannounced traffic diversion added to the problem. The Agasaim bypass road was blocked for traffic on Saturday and vehicles were diverted via the old Margao highway. As the old road is narrow and the traffic flow was heavier than usual, vehicles began to pile up fast, right from Goa Velha up to Agasaim police station. The slow movement of traffic left commuters exasperated. “Traffic was moving painfully slow. Such traffic diversions should be planned better. The officials should have known that there will be rush over the Diwali weekend and effecting the diversion on such a day should have been avoided. It was a major inconvenience for commuters. Traffic police personnel were posted, but it did not help much given the heavy traffic flow,” said Margao-resident Ann Quadros. The North Goa coastal belt saw heavy crowds and traffic congestion. “The kind of crowd seen in Calangute and Baga areas made it look like it is Christmas-New Year season already. It was difficult for even a two-wheeler to navigate through the traffic,” said Baga-resident Melanie Fernandes. The highway running through Porvorim saw traffic jam starting from Saligao up to the O’Coqueiro junction on Saturday morning and evening, as tourists headed towards the North Goa beach belt. The Saligao and O’Coqueiro junctions act as bottlenecks as highway expansion work on these stretches is yet to begin. On Saturday, the jams lead to minor collisions between vehicles along this highway, worsening the traffic situation, even as traffic police personnel were posted only at the O’Coqueiro junction to regulate traffic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/heavy-tourist-flow-festive-weekend-rush-lead-to-traffic-jams-across-state/articleshow/87560503.cms||---

Over the next few days, I will post more about unjust and unlawful manner in which we were treated. It’s time we speak up as a society against a system that cripples us, when its job is to help us,” Nilofar tweeted. For the first time since the arrest of her husband in January, Nilofer took to Twitter to express her views on the style of functioning of the NCB. Her father has launched a campaign against the NCB, particularly its zonal director, Sameer Wankhede. “Despite being within the legal parameters and the NCB having no concrete proof, her husband was arrested. This hit us hard, that was the moment, we realized it was more than just about her husband as an individual.

Among these tourists, 11 were rescued at Calangute beach, five at Baga beach and one at the Candolim beach. Dristhi lifeguards have been on their toes for the past few days as there has been a spike in tourist arrivals in the state with most of them heading to the beach for a dip in the sea. At Baga, there was a medical emergency when a 34-year-old tourist from Bengaluru had a seizure while at the beach and started bleeding from his mouth and nostrils. Lifeguards immediately rushed to his assistance and handed him over to an emergecy ambulance, Drishti Lifesaving said in a press release.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/17-rescues-over-diwali-holiday-in-north-goa-tourist-belt/articleshow/87560510.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Cops plan to keep watch on elderly living alone||KOLKATA: The attack on the elderly woman on Kali Puja night has left the middle-class neighbourhood of Tallah terrified. For the locality dominated by pensioners, Tallah police station has decided to identify homes of the elderly who live alone and keep close contact with them. Padma Mandal, 73, of Khelat Babu Lane, was alone at home on Thursday night when she was attacked by an unidentified youth. On Friday morning, her daughter and son-in-law returned home from visiting people and found the padlock of the main door broken and the doors ajar. Mandal was lying unconscious on the bed in a pool of blood. The victim’s daughter Nibedita Mandal Shau said, “We had served her dinner and left for my in-laws’ house in Ultadanga for Diwali celebration. But we could never think such a heinous attack could happen to her. We got CCTV footage of the attacker which we have shared with the police.” Nibedita’s mother-in-law Shanta Shau said, “For the last few years, Padma was incapable of doing normal domestic chores. This is why my daughter-in-law was living with her.” The police took Mandal to a government hospital but she was later shifted to a private hospital. Police suspect the attack was primarily conducted with the intention of loot. But, the woman probably woke up and the miscreant attacked her to stop her from raising an alarm. The miscreant ransacked almirahs and fled with jewellery and other valuables. Back-to-back attacks on elderly citizens in the city recently have raised concerns. A few days ago, an elderly lady was killed at her Shakespeare Sarani apartment. A local resident in Tallah said barely a year-and-a-half ago, the house right next door to Mandal’s had been burgled. “I live alone with my wife as our son lives in Maharashtra. I have asked my wife not to open the door to anybody, unless the person is known to us. We are living in fear. I also went to the police station with a request to include us in Pronam, a senior citizens’ programme of the police,” said an elderly neighbour of Mandal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-plan-to-keep-watch-on-elderly-living-alone/articleshow/87560059.cms||Amit Moulick
---||Meerut||Alleged criminal, accused of loot, robbery, and murder, arrested in police encounter||Meerut: Mohd Nadeem Kala, accused of being a notorious criminal who targeted and robbed factories at night, and who in one of the incidents, had allegedly stolen a guard's licensed gun, was arrested during a police encounter on Friday. Police say that Nadeem would move from one rented accommodation to another every two months to avoid detection. However, a tip-off sealed his fate, following which the Bulandshahr police surrounded him at Akbarpur, near Gulawati. Shots were fired from both sides and Nadeem sustained a leg injury before his arrest. Nine cases of loot, murder, and robbery have already been filed against him. The police are looking for more details. According to senior superintendent of police in Bulandshahr, Santosh Kumar Singh, "We got a tip-off that a criminal was moving towards the Akbarpur Jhoda Road and that he carried a weapon as well. Our SWAT team immediately swung into action and surrounded him. He tried to give us a slip and hid behind a mango orchard, from where he fired upon the team from a 12-bore gun. The retaliatory fire injured him. Later, he was identified as Nadeem, who was named in more than half-a-dozen criminal cases of loot, murder, and dacoity. The gun we seized happened to be the one he had robbed from a factory guard on Thursday. He also had a country-made firearm." According to Dharmendra Singh Rathore, station officer of Gulawati police station, "Nadeem Kala had fetched the gun from his relative's house and was taking it away to hide it elsewhere when the police cornered him." According to police sources, though Nadeem belonged to Hapur, he committed all crimes within the rural belt of the neighbouring district of Bulandshahr.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/alleged-criminal-accused-of-loot-robbery-and-murder-arrested-in-police-encounter/articleshow/87559453.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Nagpur||‘Implementation of theNDPS Act was draconian’||The narcotics drugs and psychotropic substances (NDPS) Act came into focus more than ever before due to the recent Aryan Khan case and kick-started a debate about the law being implemented. Well-known lawyer Firdos Mirza who practices at the Bombay High Court believes the recent implementation of the NDPS Act by the narcotics control bureau (NCB) is draconian, even though the Act itself is not. Mirza also shares some key pointers for both youngsters and their parents, on how some seemingly regular chats on WhatsApp can land you in trouble. Excerpts from an interview... Q. The much-debated part of the Aryan Khan case was that you can land up in jail even though you did not consume or possess narcotics. A. Frankly, the way things have been presented is something that has scared even us lawyers. Our Constitution grants us certain rights, which include protection from malicious offences being registered and now, these rights have to be looked at in the context of what has happened in the last one month. NDPS is a special enactment and it has been formed because drugs are a menace that’s destroying our families, our society. And under this Act there is a definition of minimum, medium and large quantity of narcotics and that is related to the punishment which can be given to the accused if found guilty. Under the minimum quantity ambit come end users for which maximum punishment is one year. Whereas the other two are for drug peddlers or cartels. But here an accused was denied bail on ‘conscious possession’, a new word which we have all come across now. Q. So, any person can face potential jail time based on ‘conscious possession’? A. Possession, the word, needs to be understood in legal terms. I possess a car but I don’t carry it around in my pocket and it’s not on my physical self. It’s parked somewhere but yes, legally I posses it. But I must be fully aware that I possess the car, and that’s called conscious possession. I possess an office and while I am away if someone leaves a bag there without my knowledge so I can’t be in conscious possession of that. Now, if narcotics are recovered from you, then there is a presumption that you possessed it and it is up to the accused to prove otherwise. However, the prosecuting agency has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that you possessed it. In other cases, it is up to the government to prove that you actually possessed the recovered materials. Q. Let’s take a hypothetical situation and talk about what an accused must do if he/she is being framed or if they are simply at the wrong place at the wrong time? A. Usually, we are known by the company we keep, but fine, let’s consider that at a party a few anti-social elements enter and soon the cops raid the place. Do understand your rights about being searched. You have the option of getting searched either by the cops there or a gazetted officer from their department or before a magistrate. This way the person being searched is also assured that nothing is being planted. The way the NDPS Act has been implemented, not interpreted, by the agency concerned is a bit alarming. I do not believe that NDPS Act is draconian, but the way it is being implemented by the officers is draconian. Q. Another angle is of WhatsApp chats. Youngsters now communicate mostly through social media. Should they be more circumspect now lest it is misinterpreted? A. For those who are innocent, why should they live in fear while communicating with friends on social media. Then it will be like living under British rule. Anyway, a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court has already said that WhatsApp chats have no evidence value. Still, I would advise youngsters to be very clear in their communication on social media so that there is no vagueness and no scope for misinterpretation. Q. But youngsters nowadays communicate with emojis or short forms of words, which may not always be understood by people belonging to one generation up. A. I know of a case wherein a milkman got entangled in an extremely serious matter. He kept a diary in which names of clients to whom he had delivered were written. But he never mentioned the word “milk”. In some case this diary got seized and the charge sheet mentioned that he was delivering RDX. It took the man nine years to prove that he was talking about milk and not RDX. So, taking this example I would urge everyone to be very clear in communication. Q. But how can parents keep a check on their wards and follow their social media interactions? A. Once we all are convinced that drugs are a menace from which our kids need to be protected, parents can go to any lengths. Parents must always be aware of who their kids’ friends are, where are they going, for what etc. That concept of privacy of kids etc cannot be an argument against safeguarding them. Youngsters too must become aware about whom they are associating with in college or elsewhere.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/implementation-of-thendps-act-was-draconian/articleshow/87560067.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Sawant said that even after files getting clearance from him, officials in some departments just ‘rotate’ the files among themselves. Chief minister said that he is aware of the ground reality as he has immense experience of working on field and administration too. “Some officials have this habit (of not clearing the files) and that is the reason sometimes there is a delay in executing decisions. Due to this, I have ordered officials to put some files on fast track,” he said. Sawant’s statement came in the backdrop of various decisions taken by him, including Ayush doctors, para teachers, contract teachers, among others getting delayed as those files are not cleared by the officials in various departments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-hits-out-at-babus-over-laxity-in-clearing-files/articleshow/87560531.cms||---

The temple body said no recommendation letters would be entertained during the three days and appealed to devotees to plan their Tirumala temple visit accordingly. Meanwhile, representatives of various departments and agencies, including APSRTC, tourism, south central railway and hoteliers association have urged TTD to increase pilgrim footfall to revive the hill town’s economy. At a meeting convened by Tirupati MP M Gurumoorthy to discuss the measures initiated by various departments to revive tourism and local economy at Shilparamam in the temple city on Saturday, representatives from the travel and hospitality sectors said unless the temple body increases pilgrim footfall in Tirumala, all sectors reliant on tourism will continue to suffer. After APSRTC, railways, and tourism officials placed the sector-wise revenue loss figures before the local MP, he assured them that he would take up the matter with TTD chairman YV Subba Reddy. The MP also hoped that the temple body will soon initiate measures to relax Covid-19 restrictions in the hill town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/no-vip-break-darshan-at-tmala-from-nov-13-to-15/articleshow/87559429.cms||Sandeep Raghavan
---||Kolkata||Kolkata airport ATC to manage 1.7 lakh sq km more airspace||KOLKATA: The city airport has started managing the Varanasi upper airspace from October 25, integrating the last sector left for the upper airspace harmonization in east and northeast that had kicked off more than six years ago in August 2015. Of the seven continental and one oceanic airspace in the Kolkata Flight Information Region (FIR), two continental airspace — Guwahati and Varanasi — were yet to be integrated till January this year. While the Guwahati upper airspace at an altitude in excess of 25,000ft was integrated with Kolkata this January, the integration of Varanasi upper airspace has now begun. The integration of these two regions had been delayed due to technical and administrative issues. Sources said manpower crunch at Kolkata ATC was one of the multiple reasons for the delay. Following the integration of the sky, area controllers seated in Kolkata will manage 250-300 overflights that travel through the 1.7 lakh sq km of Varanasi’s upper airspace extending from Khajuraho to Lucknow, providing them direct routing or straight flight paths to Delhi FIR. This will not only mean less flight time, but also result in fuel saving and contribute towards making the sky a little more green. Earlier , Kolkata upper airspace jurisdiction was till Gaya, Ranchi and Patna. With direct routing, pilots too don't need to change frequency. This means less coordination load on both pilots and controllers. It also enables controllers to enhance capacity by packing in more flights as the entire sky is under radar coverage. Controllers said the move would also make the sky safer and eliminate the possibility of conflicting flight paths due to coordination issues. "There was a lot of coordination involved in handing over so many flights to Varanasi ATC that is one of the busiest routes in the country and also receiving as many fights from the latter,” said an ATC official. Prior to the addition of the Varanasi upper airspace, controllers in Kolkata managed 11.9 lakh sq km of airspace. With the increase in jurisdiction of Kolkata air traffic region (ATR), controllers here will manage traffic on 15 international routes, 37 crossings and 10 converging points, making it one of the most challenging ATRs in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-airport-atc-to-manage-1-7l-sq-km-more-airspace/articleshow/87560061.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Kulpi bridge to open soon, spare tourists detour||KULPI: Kulpi Bridge, which was closed for repairs for nearly a month, will be functional soon. The bridge is crucial for the tourists heading from Kolkata to spots like Bakkhali, Frazergunj and Gangasagar, apart from connecting areas like Namkhana, Kakdwip, Patharpratima. The bridge on National Highway 117 was closed after Durga Puja when officials noticed some damages that required immediate repairs. While some repair work was being done, major repair was started after the Puja was over. Police had to take the decision to divert traffic earlier this week. After the bridge was temporarily shut down, tourists and commuters had to take a detour. On a normal day, the 8km stretch from Hatugunj to Kulpi More took nearly 10 minutes. This detour required commuters to travel another 8km to reach Kulpi More. This diversion also caused traffic congestion leading to increased travel time. Suparna Mukherjee, who had travelled to Bakkhali recently, said the detour took an additional hour to reach the sea coast. “For anyone travelling from Kolkata, the traffic congestion took additional time. It varies between 45 minutes to 1.5 hours. We were not aware of the traffic diversion initially and were stuck near a narrow road,” Mukherjee said. Sukanta Saha, sub-divisional officer of Diamond Harbour, said the repairs were extremely necessary. “We are aware of the travel woes locals and tourists are going through now. Primary repairs are complete. The last phase of major repair work requires traffic diversion. We are seeking cooperation of the locals and tourists,” he said. PWD executive engineer Kaushik Sengupta said the damaged portions under the bridge have already been replaced. “Some portions that have concrete structures have been replaced. But we needed traffic diversion to complete the work. We are hopeful of completing the work by the end of the coming week,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kulpi-bridge-to-open-soon-spare-tourists-detour/articleshow/87560071.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC: Inter-caste couple facing death threats to get 24x7 police protection||Mumbai: Stepping in to protect a young couple facing death threats due to their inter-caste marriage, Bombay high court has directed “round-the-clock” police protection to them, the husband’s family and two witnesses to their marriage. “We don’t want something like an honour killing,” said a vacation bench of Justices Shahrukh Kathawala and Surendra Tavade on Friday. Residents of Mumbai, the couple hail from Chaubari village, Bachao taluka, Gujarat. The woman (23) belongs to the Ahir community and the man (22) is a Brahmin. She is a commerce graduate while he has a bachelor of management studies degree. In May 2021, before the same judges, the man had filed an habeas corpus to produce his wife. At an online hearing on May 21, the woman was coerced to tell the court that she was compelled to marry him because he had her pictures. His petition was dismissed. On Friday, both came to court and recounted their plight. Realising that they need immediate protection, the judges requested advocates Deepa Chawan and Manjiri Shah to draft a petition for them. The couple eloped in February 2020 and returned 10 days later to Mumbai. In March 2020, the woman was forced to file a case of rape and kidnapping, for which the man was in jail for 4.5 months. She was taken to Gujarat and engaged to another. She returned with her parents to their Jogeshwari residence on December 23. On December 24, the young couple married at Thane. On December 29, two community heads visited them saying she must go to Chaubari and placate the community. There on January 1, 2021, alone amidst nearly 150 men who bayed for her blood, she was abused and even assaulted. On May 24, 2021, she was forced to marry a man who told her he had “purchased” her. He physically and sexually assaulted her, “including heinous grievous injury to her private parts” and even “tried to injure her with burning cigarette butts”. On August 13, 2021, she escaped and reached her Mumbai husband’s residence in Powai. More threats and violence followed. The witnesses to the marriage were threatened with death and kidnap of their children. On September 13, the man’s father was attacked with a cricket bat and stump. On October 26, a Bachao police team served her a notice, summoning her for theft of Rs 50,000 and Rs 7-8 lakh worth jewellery from the residence of the man she was forcibly married to. The petition said the local police authorities refused to take cognisance of the couple’s complaints on the “specious plea that some of the incidents occurred in Gujarat”. Apart from directing Mumbai police commissioner, the deputy commissioner (Zone X), the assistant commissioner and senior police inspector (Powai) to provide protection, the judges also directed Gujarat director general of police and Bachao senior police inspector to produce the order before the courts at Gujarat if any orders are sought against the couple. The woman’s father, a community head, the sarpanch and the man she was forcibly married to have to appear before HC on November 10, failing which the court will pass “necessary orders to ensure their presence”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-inter-caste-couple-facing-death-threats-to-get-24x7-police-protection/articleshow/87560561.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Kolkata||Mutton seller arrested for Behala woman’s murder||Kolkata: A mutton seller — identified as Khairul Mondal — was arrested on Saturday for the murder of a 52-year-old woman whose body was found in Behala on Friday. Sandhya Sardar, a resident of Bhuban Mohan Roy Road in Purba Barisha, close to Silpara, was found murdered about 2km from her residence.Police said the accused, a resident of Bishnupur in South 24 Parganas, is an employee of a meat shop in Sakherbazar and had tried to molest and physically assault the victim. When she resisted, he allegedly murdered her “in a fit of anger”. “Mondal alias Raju, a resident of Nohazari, was brought to the Thakurpukur police station based on CCTV footage and source information. After interrogation, he confessed to the crime. We, thereafter, arrested him. During questioning, he claimed he was drunk and had bad intentions and tried to pull the victim towards him late on Friday night. When she resisted, he strangulated her in a fit of rage,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma.Police said they received a call around 7am on Friday about an unconscious woman lying beside the pavement along a ditch on Santosh Roy Road. “She was taken to Vidyasagar Hospital where she was declared brought dead. Her husband Shyamaprasad Sardar was then informed. When preliminary post-mortem opinion suggested death was due to strangulation, a case was initiated in this regard,” Sharma said. CCTV footage of the entire Sakherbazar and Silpara areas was scanned for a breakthrough in the case.The police said that both the victim and her husband were mentally disabled, which had forced her two children to stay with their maternal uncle. “The accused had tried to take advantage of her mental condition, realizing she had wandered out of the house with no real purpose. When resisted, the accused showed his real criminal intentions,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mutton-seller-arrested-for-behala-womans-murder/articleshow/87560080.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Goa||Task force to decide on opening of schools from Class V: Goa CM Pramod Sawant||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Saturday said that a task force on Covid management will hold a meeting to decide on re-opening of schools from Class V and above. He also said that feedback of the education department would be sought before a decision is made. “We have not taken any decision yet,” Sawant said. Teachers have been demanding that schools be re-opened for students of Class V and above. Sawant also said that he has resolved the pending issues faced by teachers whether they are on contract basis, para teachers or part-time teachers. Last month the state government had decided to resume offline classes for Classes IX to XII in a staggered manner. The directorate of education (DoE) had issued a circular allowing schools to conduct physical classes for students of Class IX to XII, starting from October 18. The directives stated that initially schools could opt to operate in a hybrid mode — a mix of online and offline sessions. “The government, after consultation with the expert committee, has decided to allow re-opening of schools from Classes IX to XII (physical format) from October 18 by following the guidelines/SOPs mentioned. Heads of institutions and the management are requested to make their own decision taking into consideration available infrastructure and local conditions. Schools may, if required, initially follow a hybrid mode of teaching i.e. online as well as offline classes,” director Bhushan Savaikar has said. “For students who choose not to attend physical school, recorded class lessons and any other online mode of teaching may be followed,” the circular read. The timetable should be prepared in such a manner that there will be no crowding and school functions and assemblies are to be avoided until further advisory is issued, the guidelines stated. “Schools, if required, may schedule classes/timetables in both shifts taking into consideration available infrastructure and local conditions,” the circular read. “High risk children (those suffering from chronic diseases like asthma, kidney diseases, disabled children, children on steroids, etc) should consult their paediatrician or physician before joining. Students, teachers or staff having symptoms of Covid-19 are advised to get tested immediately,” the SOPs stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/task-force-to-decide-on-opening-of-schools-from-class-v-sawant/articleshow/87560540.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata accidents dip in Covid-hit 2020, but drink driving a concern||KOLKATA: Last year’s lockdown that saw empty streets for three months and gradual unlocking thereafter when traffic was sparse resulted in a sharp decline in road fatalities in 2020. From 2,068 accidents in 2019, the number decreased to 1,683 in 2020, revealed a report, titled Accidental Deaths and Suicides, released by the National Crime Records Bureau on Thursday. The number of people killed on the roads also dipped, with the figure decreasing from 294 to 201 in a year. Drink driving and reckless overtaking remained matters of concern, as these two reasons together led to 957 of the total accidents taking place in the city. At 345 the number of drink driving in Kolkata turned out to be second only to Chennai, where the figure was 726, the report said. Besides, complete disregard for rules by a section of two-wheeler riders, especially when they did not spot cops on the road, was to blame for most fatal accidents in this city, showed the NCRB data, which considered 53 cities across India for the survey. Speeding was blamed for 375 cases, while 46 accidents took place due to mechanical faults. In 155 cases, police blamed poor visibility due to torrential rains and the fog. A total of 1,401 people were injured. Though Kolkata recorded the least number accidents per 1 lakh population among metros, its fatal accident count in 2020, which was 192, was bettered by 16 other cities, though those are non-metros with fewer population. Srinagar reported 45 fatal accidents, Amritsar 66 and Varanasi 71. In Delhi, 1,151 people were killed in accidents, in Chennai 872, in Mumbai 418 and in Bengaluru 646.  Though senior citizens were victims in most of the accidents in Kolkata, deaths were linked to the 45-60 age group. Maximum deaths —41 of them — took place between 8pm and 11pm, while 35 were recorded between 9am and noon. The NCRB findings were similar to the figures recently shared by Kolkata Police and both agreed that trucks and buses accounted for 44% of fatal accidents in the city. While trucks killed 47 people on the roads in 2020, private buses were to blame for 41 deaths. Private cars were involved in 29 fatal cases and two-wheelers in 20. Overall, goods vehicles were involved in 96 accidents, buses in 60, cars in 150 and two-wheelers in 123. “Bus and truck drivers need to be extra cautious, given a crash with a heavy vehicle most always leads to deaths,” said a fatal squad officer. Bengal overall, like Kolkata, registered a drop—that of 11%—in the number of accidents, reporting 10,843 crashes in 2020, while the count was 12,233 in 2019. The number of deaths was 5,171.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-accidents-dip-in-cov-hit-2020-but-drink-driving-a-concern/articleshow/87560088.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Prabhag number 31 residents will take to the roads on Sunday to condemn the four ruling BJP corporators for failing to provide adequate civic amenities in south Nagpur. Speaking to TOI on the eve of their protest, residents claimed that the four BJP corporators Ravindra Bhoyar, Shital Kamdi, Usha Pilot and Satish Holey had failed to provide even basic civic amenities like proper roads, decently-maintained gardens, playgrounds and drainage system in the area. Group convenor Ravindra Bhusari said, “A public protest rally will be held at Mahavir Nagar Maidan on Sunday at 4pm. A large number of citizens from ward 31 will attend this protest meeting by the social group ‘Maza Mahavir Nagar’.” Residents said that if the situation remained same, they would boycott the ruling party in the ensuing civic polls. Many pointed out that multiple elected representatives had affected the development of the locality. “In fact, instead of improved facilities, the civic amenities in the prabhag have deteriorated,” said another resident Ishwar Balbhude. Residents also claimed that barring Holey, they have not seen any of the three BJP corporators taking feedback from citizens over basic amenities. Balbhude added, “In the name of development, the ruling party has destructed the environment as hundreds of fully-grown trees were chopped off for constructing cement roads.” Footpaths were ill-maintained with no manhole covers, he said, adding that drainage lines at many places were broken too. Locals said the internal roads are also in bad shape. Many roads have not been renovated in the last 10 years, they added. Door-to-door garbage collection in this part of the city has deteriorated, resulting in a rise in black spots where people are dumping trash, said Balbhude. This has led to an increase in vector-borne diseases. According to residents, one cannot keep doors and windows open even during daytime due to the mosquito menace. Residents pointed out that in the past too, the group Maza Mahavir Nagar had organised protest meetings and met with the sitting corporators. The corporators had promised a time-bound programme for development of the localities falling under this prabhag. “But nothing has been done so far,” alleged another resident Anil Gaware. Citing examples, another aggrieved resident Rakesh Pandit claimed that the Mahavir Nagar ground had turned into an ideal place for anti-social elements. “After sunset, this huge open ground turns into an open bar. Despite complaints to the sitting corporators, no measures have been taken to resolve this issue,” said Harsha Wankhede. To curb this, residents and members of Maza Mahavir Nagar comprising Dinesh Bhagwatkar, Shibhangi Pohre, Amol Bhusari, Pradip Shivankar, Vinayak Sawane and Priya Pohre among others, undertook many awareness campaigns and conducted a mega plantation drive in the ground, which led to mayor Dayashankar Tiwari declaring the area as an ‘oxygen zone’. However, Mahavir Nagar residents allege that the “inactive corporators” have failed to improve the status of basic amenities. Like the huge ground, the condition of Mahavir garden is no different.

Mayor Kishori Pednekar who visited the site said the fire may have broken out due to a diya or a lamp kept in the balcony of the flat. The fire erupted around 8:30pm at Hansa Heritage building on Mathuradas Road, opposite the Lijjat Papad shop, in Kandivli (West). Fire brigade designated it as a Level 1 blaze. Fire engines were rushed to the spot to douse it. The two victims who were were injured in the blaze were taken to Shatabdi Hospital where they were declared as brought dead.  A total of five persons were rescued by firemen. Details of the dead and the injured were still to be confirmed till late on Saturday. Pednekar said, “I’ve been told that the fire was probably caused due to a diya kept in the balcony at one of the houses on the 14th floor. Due to high wind speed, the fire later spread to the 15th floor. The fire brigade rescued around five people from the building. Fortunately, the fire station is very close to the building and hence the call was attended to at an early stage of the fire and it did not spread to more floors.” The fire brigade disconnected the power connection after reaching the spot and shut Mathuradas Road to traffic. Fire brigade officials told TOI the blaze had been brought under control and they would carry out cooling operations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-die-in-blaze-at-kandivli-highrise-firemen-save-5/articleshow/87560568.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Goa||Goa: Over 1 lakh due for 2nd dose, but hesitant to take jab||PANAJI: The directorate of health services will hold a second mega vaccination camp at Goa Medical College, government health centres and sub-centres across the state on Sunday to ensure that people are doubly vaccinated as soon as possible. “Experts have said that the best time to get vaccinated is when cases and and infectivity are very low. This is the right time to take the vaccine and develop herd immunity,” state immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Borkar said. Although 80% of Goa’s ‘eligible’ population (9.3 lakh) have taken both doses and 106% (12.4 lakh) the first dose, there are still over one lakh persons due for their second dose. “These one lakh persons are those who have already completed the mandatory 84 days after the first dose, but who haven’t come forward for their second dose yet. The mega vaccination camp is for both the first and second doses, but we especially want this group to get doubly vaccinated,” Borkar said. The state vaccinates an average of 5,000 persons each day. At the last mega vaccination camp, this number went up to 14,000 plus which was less than expected considering the number of centres and resources put in for the camp. “There are some sections of the floating population from Maharashtra, Karnataka and Odisha who have taken the first dose here and gone back to their native states,” Borkar said. Chief minister Pramod Sawant has set a deadline of November 15 for Goa to achieve 100% vaccination of both doses to its eligible population. The health ministry in a letter to all states has called for a comprehensive plan to be drawn up at the district level by respective district magistrates to approach the missed out and left out beneficiaries. The ministry has also asked states to rope in influential persons (religious leaders, community leaders, medical professionals, public representatives, sports personalities, army personnel, ex-servicemen, etc) and NCC/NSS cadets in the village/urban areas to motivate and mobilise people for vaccination. On Saturday, another 645 persons took their first dose of the vaccine and 5,558 their second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/over-1l-due-for-2nd-dose-but-hesitant-to-take-jab/articleshow/87560566.cms||---

The racketeers had promised the aspirants a hassle-free employment after greasing the palms of their “good contacts” in the railways. It’s learnt, Sonegaon police have registered an offence of cheating and criminal breach of trust against Kawaljeet Gaherwal, Ajit Kumar alias Hitesh Hedau and Nilesh Thakre following a complaint lodged by one Prithviraj Pandey. Police said Pandey, who worked as property dealer, had come in contact with the racketeers through Thakre. The other aspirants were later lured by promise of a job in the Northern railways as ticket checker. “The racket is spread across the nation. In Nagpur, the racketeers used the name of Northern railways having headquarters in New Delhi. So, for anyone staying in Maharashtra verifying the credentials would become difficult,” said a cop who is part of the investigation. It’s learnt, the racketeers had arranged for a fake medical examination at a hospital in New Delhi citing it had a tie-up with Northern railways. The racketeers also made each victim cough up Rs two lakh after the medical test. A police officer said that the accused later prepared a fake selection list and shared it with the victims on their WhatsApp chats. After convincing the victims to pay more couple of lakhs, the racketeers took them to Sarangpur in Madhya Pradesh for a so-called training sessions and kept them at an abandoned school for a month. “It was a farcical training session and the victims realized they were being duped even as the racketeers had issued them fake appointment letters,” said a Sonegaon police station officer. The officer added that an offence was registered after the victims approached the Sonegaon police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/job-aspirants-duped-of-rs40l-in-fake-rly-recruitment-drive/articleshow/87560104.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BJP now wants MVA govt to cut VAT on fuel||Mumbai: Hitting out at Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, BJP on Saturday said the state government should also cut taxes on fuel. “After the Modi government reduced the price of petrol by Rs5 and diesel by Rs10, the Thackeray government should reduce VAT and give more concessions in the state,” BJP state president Chandrakant Patil said. “While smaller states like Assam and Goa can afford concessions, the richest state, Maharashtra, should also be able to afford them. It is the natural expectation of people that the state government, like the central government, will provide relief by cutting taxes on petrol and diesel. But spokespersons for the ruling party have called for all tax reductions to be made by Centre. This is not acceptable. All responsibility will be borne by the Centre and state will only collect taxes,” Patil asked. “Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP agitated against hikes in petrol and diesel prices. But now that the Centre has given concessions the ruling parties’ reluctance to reduce petrol and diesel rates by reducing VAT exposed their hypocrisy,” he said.

In the past 48 hours, more than 200 patients suffering from breathing problems reported at the SN Medical College in Agra. Earlier, just two or three patients with respiratory ailments were being admitted at the hospital daily. Out of these 200, 15 patients in critical condition were admitted to the emergency ward. Another 15 patients were admitted in the chest disease and tuberculosis ward. All these patients were put on oxygen support. Most of them had swelling in the lungs, hospital authorities said. Coinciding with the Diwali festival, the air quality index (AQI) in Agra city, which was ‘poor’ touched the ‘severe’ mark on Friday. Dr Prashant Gupta, SNMC principal, said, “Since Diwali, there has been a significant increase in the number of patients with respiratory ailments. A majority of such patients who have been admitted had suffered asthmatic attacks and were in the age group 30 to 60 years. Patients of tuberculosis and those who had Covid-19 infection earlier also complained of difficulty in breathing due to the high level of pollution. Patients admitted have been put on oxygen support.” Besides respiratory ailments, health department officials claimed an increase in the number of patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases and irritation in eye and skin. In the past 48 hours, more than 2,000 people suffering from problems caused by air pollution reported at government hospitals in Agra division. Dr AK Srivastava, chief medical officer of Agra district, said, “Since Diwali, the air pollution level has significantly increased. It is harmful even for healthy people. Asthma and tuberculosis patients should avoid going to public places. They should also increase the dose of their inhalers as per doctor’s suggestion. Those who need to go out should wear a face mask and keep the body covered.” Meanwhile, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Saturday reported 'very poor' air quality index (AQI) in Agra at 390 (average AQI of last 24 hours). Particulate matter 2.5 remained a prominent air pollutant, eight times higher than normal limits. According to doctors, prolonged exposure to PM 2.5 beyond the safe limits can harm the respiratory system as the ultra fine particulates can find their way deep into the lungs and also enter the bloodstream.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/as-air-quality-dips-agras-snmc-sees-200-patients-with-respiratory-ailments-in-48-hrs/articleshow/87559487.cms||Deepak Lavania

An FIR was registered against 11 people, including his nephew and cousin. All were named by the deceased’s family members. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Agra, Sudhir Kumar Singh, said Shivanshu Mudgal, (the nephew of the deceased) and Tarkeshwar Mudgal (cousin of the deceased) were arrested by the police for killing Ram Bahadur. “Shivanshu has confessed to committing the crime. The pistol that was used for the murder has also been recovered,” the SSP said, adding that the suspect told the police that Ram Bahadur had illegally taken possession of six-seven shops that were registered under his name. During interrogation, Shivanshu said that Tarkeshwar had also been duped by the deceased in a similar fashion, which is why he accompanied him to commit the crime. The kin of the deceased alleged that they had informed the police about this dispute, but the police failed to take the matter seriously, resulting in the death of Ram Bahadur. There was a long-standing dispute over the properties. The FIR was lodged by the police under sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 506 (criminal intimidation) along with some other sections of the IPC at the Shahganj police station on November 3 on the basis of a complaint filed by the deceased’s son, Mahan Mudgal, who is a lawyer. The complainant stated that his father was sitting near a dhaba when four bike-borne men came and opened fire at his father. “My father immediately collapsed and when my brother and I tried to catch the shooter, they opened fire with an intention to kill us. However, we were not hurt,” the FIR reads, adding that his father was threatened by one Rajeev on the phone who said that he would kill him and his family almost two hours before the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/nephew-cousin-arrested-for-agra-lawyers-murder/articleshow/87559505.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The drive was carried out by the radial roads division of the roads and buildings department to make way for six radial roads in the area. Mild tension prevailed at the demolition site when half a dozen earth movers reached the spot around 8 am on Saturday, leaving residents and traders agitated. About 150 policemen from six police stations under the Cyberabad commissionerate had to be deployed to avoid any untoward incident. “We are shocked to see them demolish our properties since the officials did not intimate us about it. They did not give us time to vacate the premises,” said K Prabhavathi, a local of the area. Another resident, Hanumanthu, said, “Half of my grocery shop has been affected. I have lost my bread and butter,” he rued. Dr Vanishree, a gynaecologist said, “We have been running the hospital for the past four years and now authorities have turned up to demolish it.” According to authorities, the properties — residential and commercial — have encroached on government land (Sy No 34). “Apart from these, we have to acquire another 15 properties built on private land for the project. These owners will be compensated accordingly,” said Rajendranagar RDO, Chandrakala. She added: “We served notices to all owners three times asking them to vacate the premises. Only after that we have started demolition.” According to deputy engineer, R&B (radial roads division), Krishna Reddy, a two-lane flyover has been proposed at Gopanpally tanda connecting Tellapur and Outer Ring Road that would benefit over 1.5 lakh commuters. “The state government is spending ₹11 crore to build it.

Police said the accused duped the contractor by promising to invest his money in crypto currency. Main accused is on the run. The accused made the contractor believe that they were transferring the money to various bank accounts of fictitious companies. Police said the accused gave returns initially to gain the contractor’s confidence. The accused told the contractor to invest more with a promise to get higher returns. Believing them, he invested Rs 86 lakh. When he tried to withdraw the earnings, as displayed in the software shared by the accused, he could not get access .

---||Hyderabad||Merc damaged in rain, consumer panel tells insurer to pay Rs 17 lakh||Hyderabad: The Telangana State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has directed ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company Ltd to reimburse Rs 17 lakh within six weeks to an aggrieved owner of a Mercedes Benz car towards repair charges along with an annual interest of 9 per cent from May 2012 till the date of payment. A bench comprising Justice MSK Jaiswal and member Meena Ramanathan pronounced this order after hearing two appeals filed by the insurance company and Mercedes Benz AG company along with its dealer, who challenged an order from a district court which ordered them to compensate the customer by sharing the burden proportionately. The complainant, Narendra Surana of Secunderabad, had purchased the Benz car in 2009 and been fighting a legal battle to regain the huge repair charges he incurred on account of damage suffered by the engine. Surana purchased Mercedes Benz E 350 L for Rs 47 lakh from Adiswar Auto Diagnostics, authorised Benz dealer in Hyderabad, and got the high-end car registered on December 3, 2009. He took a car insurance on October 14, 2010, from ICICI Lombard. On July 28, 2011, at 12.15 am, the car hit a stone on Road No. 2, Banjara Hills. Since it was raining heavily, the accumulated rainwater entered the car engine. The customer informed the dealer about the situation and called for a mechanic help. The mechanic arrived, but due to his inexperience, he tried to start the vehicle. The vehicle was shifted to the workshop. Both the Merc company and its dealer offered some discount and the customer spent Rs 17 lakh for repair. He was seeking a refund of this amount from the insurance company. Initially, Surana filed his complaint before the district consumer forum. The district forum asked the insurance company to pay Rs 12 lakh and the car company and the dealer were jointly asked to pay Rs 5 lakh. Aggrieved by this order, the car company and the dealer filed one appeal and the insurance company preferred a separate appeal . The consumer commission gave a ruling that the car company and the dealer were not at fault because the warranty states that if the car was run through unpliable areas and waterlogged roads, the warranty does not apply. Accordingly, both of them were exonerated. The commission, however, said the exemption cannot be given to the insurance company because the policy covers natural calamities and hence the insurance company cannot escape the responsibility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/merc-damaged-in-rain-consumer-panel-tells-insurer-to-pay-rs-17-lakh/articleshow/87560150.cms||---

The inspection was conducted to check for compliance of measures required for the safety of passengers and other stakeholders. After the inspection, it was decided that Mapusa Municipal Council, Urban Health Centre and the Kadamba Transport Corporation Limited will submit their action taken reports on the inspection findings by mid-November to DySp traffic and chairman of monitoring cell Salim Sheikh, for onward submission to North Goa collector Ajit Roy. As the Mapusa bus stand is an important terminus in North Goa, it was decided to examine the implementation of the recommendations made during the earlier inspection held in January last year. The inspection team of officials from various departments along with consumer forum volunteers included KTCL’s divisional traffic officer Vishnu Shetgaonkar, Mapusa fire station officers Bosco Ferrao and Rupesh Samant, Mapusa municipal Nadeem M Sheikh, transport department officers Pawan N Shet and Pravin Wadkar, sanitary inspector at Mapusa urban health centre, Uday V Tamhanker and coordinator, Charles Correia Foundation, Tahir Noronha. It was found that many of the Deendayal Rojgar Yojana Kiosks which were sublet had made all kinds of encroachments in the open space, and storage of soft drink bottles, crates and ancillary businesses of florists and tobacco products had resulted in obstruction to free movement of the passengers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/irregularities-found-at-mapusa-bus-stand-during-inspection/articleshow/87560620.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||4 former naxals held for extortion||Hyderabad: Four former naxalites, who were part of two banned organisations, were arrested by Rachakonda police on Saturday on the charges of extorting money from businessmen by brandishing weapons. Police said the arrested trio include Pittala Srinivas, Edavalli Srinivas Reddy and Gangapuram Swamy, ex-members of Janashakti party, and V Naga Mallaiah, a former member of CPI(ML) People’s War Group. Ashok, who allegedly printed pamplets in the name of CPI(Maoist) party and supplied them to the accused, is absconding. Acting on a tip-off that the accused were attempting to either extort or commit a dacoity in Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district and Hyderabad, police conducted a raid on a house in Yadadri and nabbed the quartet. Two air guns, one country-made weapon, gas cylinders and other equipment were seized. The four accused had surrendered before police several years ago. While Pittala was involved in five offences, Mallaiah and Swamy had one offence each. Police said Pittala was good in altering air guns into country-made weapons. “He bought air guns and pellets via online. Then converted them into revolvers and pistols,” police said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/4-former-naxals-held-for-extortion/articleshow/87560155.cms||---

Bhaniyana police reached the spot and kept the body in a mortuary and informed her family. Her family members reached on Friday after which the post-mortem was conducted. Suspecting murder due to injury marks, her family members were not ready to take the body. However, they took the body for cremation after the police called her husband for inquiry. Her family members lodged a case against the husband and her father-in-law under Sections 302 (punishment for murder) and 498 (cruelty to women) of the Indian Penal Code. Police are investigating the case. Bhaniyana SHO Khetaram Godara said according to the in-laws of Nakhtu Devi (29), she was washing clothes before she suddenly died. Devi’s parents told police that the in-laws used to beat her up very often and harass her. They said panchayat was called by the society several times and she had come to her parents’ house 3-4 times. They added that her in-laws would come and take her every time assuring her of no more violence.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Police-certified, 'idiot-proof' fake guns keep shootings mishap-free since 90s||MUMBAI: Sitting in a Goregaon warehouse stacked with explosives, rocket launchers, AK47s and black imported pistols, Vishal Tyagi gets a call. "Do you have sniper rifles?" a voice is heard on the speakerphone. "Snipers? Send me a 'Hi' on WhatsApp. I will send you pictures," says Vishal. Son of dacoit-turned-TV-actor-turned-Bollywood-prop-gun-supplier Mahendra Tyagi, who died in a 1989 studio fire in Mysuru, Vishal is part of a daredevil fellowship called the Movie Action Dummy Effects Association (MADEA) whose 650-odd members supply police-certified prop guns for film and TV shoots in India. Examined under the spotlight of the recent Hollywood on-set shooting accident in which a gun discharged by actor Alec Baldwin killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, the job of dummy weapon suppliers appears both significant and underrated. Unlike the '70s when Western-inspired desi films used real guns borrowed from the likes of Vishal's fugitive father, all the realistic guns that actors now haul are fake, insists Vishal. "We only use dummy guns that have police certificates. The bullets do not contain lead. They can only cause a sound and a flash on pulling the trigger," says Vishal. SFX suppliers rue delays in dummy guns’ certificationWhile Hollywood has had a long, tragic history of fatal on-set firing accidents dating back to 1915, the last such reported incident in India was in the 1990s when a Gujarati actor died after pulling the trigger on his forehead. “They probably used a blank gun made in a village," guesses Vishal, who is no stranger to the Indian film industry's hurried, "jugaad" ways. “Idiot-proof” is how Abhijeet Singh of Indiansforguns, an online forum of gun enthusiasts, likes to describe the design of prop guns. “These guns have a solid steel rod in place of a functional barrel. The rod is designed to chamber specialized blank ammunition that produces a sound and creates a realistic movement of the firearm by venting out the explosive gases below. Even if one were to try and insert any kind of ammunition containing a projectile into such a device, there is no way it could propel the projectile as the rod is not hollow,” says Singh, adding that “if someone were ever stupid enough to try something like this, it would simply destroy the blank gun and likely cause the user serious injury!” Often mistaken for the sound effects department by the industry they serve, the dummy gun suppliers, who also flip cars, overturn trucks and blast cylinders on cue, got their own union in 1993 when erstwhile firearms suppliers such as Nirmal Singh and Attar Singh laid down rules for medical insurance and death compensation following on-set accidents. Its prescribed per-shift wage for each worker who must accompany a gun on set is Rs 2,627 though many are able to bargain for more. Among the occupational hazards is being called in for questioning by cops on discovery of dummy ammo. Moustachioed special effects master Niraj Mishra once caused a traffic jam in Andheri when cops found two silver prop guns in his car. “At such times, we simply show our certificates,” says veteran Babu Tyagi, whose three-storey warehouse in Goregaon has a guard on each floor. Of late though, the certificates have become a tad hard to come by. Ever since the Arms Rules, 2016, brought the formerly-ungoverned prop weapons under the ambit of arms licencing, “we have to seek permissions for import from both the customs officer and the Department General of Foreign Trade. This has led to delays”, says Vishal, who has been waiting for a set of imported guns to be certified since November 2020. “Then, there are heavy customs duties. At this rate, how can we hope to upgrade ourselves to international standards?” asks the 45-year-old who feels wounded by the lack of a technical award for special effects suppliers. Tiny sparks of hope, though, have arrived recently in the form of VFX and heightened awareness. Even before the Baldwin incident, Vishal noted how a film crew had started insisting on filling in things like the muzzle flash with CGI. If one OTT platform’s Indian crew allowed Vishal to test a car flipper before the shot recently, another OTT giant inundated him with questions about “health and safety”. “Especially since we are shooting in intimate, controlled environments in Covid times, there is greater concern about safety,” says Vishal. Later, he gets into his car and puts another caller on speakerphone: “Sir, do you have a suicide bombing reference?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sfx-suppliers-rue-delays-in-dummy-guns-certification/articleshow/87560634.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

---||Jodhpur||Dozens of Demoiselle cranes found dead or sick near Jodhpur||JODHPUR: Dozens of migratory Demoiselle cranes, popularly known as ‘kurjan’, were found either sick or dead in Kaparda village near Jodhpur on Saturday. Forest department sent a team to the spot to ascertain the cause of the sickness and deaths of the migratory birds. According to a wildlife activist from the village, Bhajan Lal Nain, a huge flock of birds has come to the village and can be seen strolling near the village pond for the past few days. “On Saturday, I noticed some of the birds dead near the pond. When I checked further, I found many of them to be dead and some of them were so sick that they were not able to stand on their legs,” he said, adding that there were dozens of such birds scattered in a large area. Nain shared the information with some persons and some of them informed the forest officials about the incident. A team of the forest department and veterinarians reached the spot to take stock of the situation and began treatment of the sick birds. “Prima facie, it appears that they might have consumed a poisonous grain, that may be laced with some pesticide or something,” said one of them. But they said that the exact cause of the birds falling sick could be ascertained only after a detailed medical examination of the viscera of the dead ones, which they collected and arranged to send to the laboratory for examination. It may be noted that the ‘kurjan’ birds fly thousands of kilometres, all the way to the parts of Marwar with Khinchan in Phalodi subdivision being their main stay. But of late, they are being spotted at many other places with ponds. About 2 years back as well, hundreds of birds were found dead in Khinchan and their death had been attributed to the consumption of poison or pesticide-laced grains, following the examination of their viscera. After that, steps had been taken to make sure that the grains provided to them for consumption were free from any pesticide or any other material used for preserving the grains. Wildlife biologist from Guru Govind Singh Indraprastha University, New Delhi Sumit Dookia said that this could be a result of consumption of seeds treated with some chemical or medicine, which was used by the farmers before sowing in the fields.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/dozens-of-demoiselle-cranes-found-dead-or-sick-near-jodhpur/articleshow/87560159.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Bada Qabrastan to get mortuary and separate mosque for women||MUMBAI: For a graveyard, how big is too big? For Bada Qabrastan or ‘big graveyard’--which has to accommodate an incremental number of the dead with each passing year--an addition of even an inch to its around 7.5-acre sprawl is a boon. So, the living can celebrate that the iconic graveyard at Marine Lines will soon have around 700 sq ft additional space where a 'ghusul khana' (a room to give bath and ablutions to female bodies) and a separate mosque for women will be built. Recently, Juma Masjid of Bombay Trust which manages Juma Masjid near Crawford Market, Bada Qabrastan and some other properties, got the tenant who lived in a room occupying 700 sq ft of the graveyard surrendered to the Trust. “The family willingly vacated the room where we will build a ladies’ ghusul khana and a small mosque for them,” says the Trust’s president Shoeb Khatib. “There is a ghusul khana for females in the centre of the qabrastan. Now the new facility will be moved to near the existing mosque close to the main gate.” In the pipeline is also a mortuary. “Most people have small homes and, if they have to keep the bodies for many hours as the dead persons’ kin arrive from outside, they desperately look for mortuaries. Our mortuary will be a big help,” claims Khatib. There are six gates to this nearly 200-year-old massive Muslim cemetery. A stone plaque near the main entry informs that famous Konkani Muslim philanthropist Nakhuda Mohammed Ali Roghe bought two parcels of land: first from Mrs Wombay, widow of businessman Mr Balaji Shamsheth on August 8 1829 for Rs 26,620 and another from Shapoorjee Sorabjee for Rs 32,251 on May 28, 1832. The entire land is divided into 15 harwads or sectors. Each sector has different blocks. Each block has multiple ottas or graves. TOI met some members of Bhishti Mohalla Sunni Muslim Ghachi Jamaat at their harwad or sector in the graveyard’s north-western part. “Earlier, we would pay money to outside people who would water the plants near the graves. Now our family ottas are registered with the Trust and they take care of our family harwad,” says Abdul Kadr Musa, a Ghachi Jamaat member. Khatib explains that all the harwads are owned by the Trust but many Jamaats have been burying their dead in the harwads allotted to them long ago. During the pandemic, Bada Qabrastan played a big role as over 1200 Covid-19 victims were buried here. “Since we have space, we never say no to anyone, even unclaimed bodies provided they have death certificates,” says Khatib, opening a well-thumbed register of entries of the bodies received during the pandemic.Typically, this graveyard receives close to 120 bodies every month. Around 90% of the unclaimed bodies of Muslims in the city are given free funerals here. Twelve grave diggers work in two shifts while 14 sweepers and a dozen security guards take care of the huge, green resting place that is open 24 hours. Paved pathways shaded by hundreds of coconuts, mango, neem and other trees give the graveyard the look of a well-kept garden.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bada-qabrastan-to-get-mortuary-separate-mosque-for-women/articleshow/87560637.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

---||Varanasi||Idea of Ram Rajya took shape in Vantangia village, says Yogi||Gorakhpur: “The idea of Ram Rajya took shape in Vantangia village,” Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said while celebrating Diwali at ‘Vantangia Tinkonia jungle -3’ village in Gorakhpur on Thursday. The CM, who has been celebrating Diwali with Vantangia people for the last 25 years, also inaugurated/laid foundation of eight development projects on the occasion and honoured many senior citizens of Vantangia villages in Gorakhpur andMaharajganj districts with gifts. Elaborating his assertion, Yogi said: “The schemes that were a dream for Vantangia villagers are now a reality as every beneficiary is easily getting the benefits. After 70 years of independence, the villagers were devoid of voting rights and also from basic amenities of life. But, after 2017 a new chapter in their life opened and now everyone has a pucca house, toilet, power supply, LPG gas, potable water, approval letter for land to do farming, ration card, Ayushman health card and benefits of many other government welfare schemes. This condition is ‘Ram Rajya’... the idea of Ram Rajya took shape in Vantangia village.” “Now they are no more victims of harassment by the police department or the forest department here,” he added. The CM lit earthen lamps and started Deepotsav in the village. He also went to the house of village head Ram Ganesh and met many people while taking a tour of the village. He also went to the smart class for children’s composite school and asked the children to not hesitate in asking questions from teachers. He appealed to the Vantangia villagers to protect the forest. He also asked them to take a resolution not to make or drink liquor and send their children to school. “The government is giving free education to girls till graduation and also providing free tablet/smart phones to UG/PG students so that they can continue online classes without any difficulty,” the CM said. Praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to provide free Covid-19 treatment, free vaccine and lowering the price of petrol and diesel, he said: “Keeping in view the effect of escalating price of petrol and diesel in the country, PM Modi lowered excise duty and subsequently the price of diesel has been lowered by Rs 10 and petrol by Rs 5. The state government has announced to lower the price of both petrol and diesel by Rs 12 each. It will check inflation and benefit the farmers and youth.” The CM appealed to the people to celebrate Diwali with the poor and needy, saying that “a ‘deepak’ (earthen lamp) is not a symbol of light but of knowledge, prosperity and happiness. And to bring happiness to everyone’s life, Deepotsav in Ayodhya is being celebrated with lakhs of people.” The chief minister went to many stalls in the exhibition in Vantangia village and performed ‘annaprashan’ of three children and also ‘goodbharai’ of two women and gave them gifts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/idea-of-ram-rajya-took-shape-in-vantangia-village-says-yogi/articleshow/87560661.cms||Arjumand Bano

Protesting since December 2019, the priests said, “We will continue our agitation. There is a possibility that government may amend the Act but won’t roll it back. Therefore, we will stick to our plan,” Brijesh Sati, spokesperson, Char Dham Tirth Purohit Mahapanchayat told TOI. He added, “It might be a tactic on part of government to delay the issue. The portals of Badrinath will shut on November 20 and government has assured action by November 30. Therefore, we have decided to continue our protest.” Protests will be held in different areas, including villages. “During his visit, PM Narendra Modi lauded the efforts of ‘Purohits’ in the reconstruction and revival work but did not make any announcement. Therefore, we believe that the issue still hangs in balance,” said Sati. Meanwhile, agriculture minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal said a committee has been formed and the matter is being reviewed. “We have announced that after going through all the facts, a decision will be taken by November 30. It is being ensured that no one is deprived of their right, therefore, the priests, too, have been included in the panel,” said Uniyal.

The schemes included Sanjay Gandhi Niradhar Yojana and Sharavanbal Yojana. Interacting with media here on Saturday, BJP city president Pravin Datke said that the minister must immediately take efforts to release funds of the aggrieved beneficiaries “who were forced to observe black Diwali due to the government’s apathy”. Datke said the minister should ensure that the dues of all beneficiaries are released within a week. He threatened that BJP would once again hit the streets “to protest the injustice meted out to the beneficiaries”. Accompanied by other party leaders and MLAs, including Krishna Khopde, Girish Vyas, Vikas Kumbhare, the BJP MLC pointed out that Raut had convened a meeting of office bearers concerned regarding pending dues of both schemes at collectorate and directed them to release the dues before October 30. “The minister’s statement was published across the media and circulated on various social media platforms. However, he never serious about resolving problems of over 30,000 beneficiaries, who were waiting for their dues for the last couple of years.” Terming Raut’s call to the government officials as farce, Datke assured the deprived beneficiaries that “the saffron party would always stand by them till their demands were fulfilled”. The BJP city chief said that the minister had asked the Sanjay Gandhi Niradhar Yojana beneficiaries in the jurisdiction of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) to apply again after their dues were stopped by the officials. “It shows that he had no knowledge about the scheme,” said Datke. Datke alleged that on one hand the government had not paid funds to the genuine beneficiaries of both schemes citing false reasons and on other hand, many ineligible persons were provided with benefits. “We want ineligible persons should not get undue benefits while the genuine ones should not be deprived of the scheme.” He said senior citizens, widows, handicapped, third gender persons and others were made to run pillar to post to again collect documents like domicile required for fresh application. “We had been following the issue since the last couple of years with former collector Ravindra Thakare and his successor R Vimala,” the BJP city chief said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-seeks-rauts-apology-over-pending-welfare-scheme-funds/articleshow/87560190.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Hyderabad||State’s announcement an eyewash: Activists||Hyderabad: Activists said that the government should first invoke Water, Land and Trees Act (WALTA) authorities at all levels in the state instead of forming new committees or creating new positions to protect lakes in GHMC and elsewhere in Telangana. They said that announcing that GHMC would soon have a special commissioner for lakes is just an eyewash, which is never meant to happen, and added that instead of protecting lakes, the state itself is encroaching upon them by planting trees and laying roads. “What is the need to form new ones to protect lakes, when the existing ones are non-functional. Why can’t they implement WALTA- 2002,” questioned Lubna Sarwath, activist and ex-convener of Save Our Urban Lakes (SOUL). She said that under WALTA, top officials, representatives and the public will have to work together for clean water bodies, air and ground and protect green cover among others at state, district, and mandal levels. “Looks like the state doesn’t want to sit with public and resolve issues or give them a platform to raise questions and get them addressed,” she said, and added that instead of protecting lakes, the state is removing lakes from the database so as to encroach upon them. The activists claimed that since 2016, the holding capacity of lakes has been shrunk, and pollution and encroachments have increased. They further added that the state is doing absolutely nothing to protect lakes and is just spending lakhs of rupees in the name of beautification. “When we talk about lake restoration, it means the lake has to be restored to its natural size—length, breadth and height. All our officials do is dry up the lake, create a walking path, or install a fountain,” said Thakur Raj Kumar Singh, an environmental activist, adding that there are lakes that were drained four years back, but no restoration work has been carried out. “It won’t be a surprise if these lakes give way to parks with a small pond,” he added, and said that the officials have not removed any encroachments in the past few years or ensured that only rainwater enters into water bodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/states-announcement-an-eyewash-activists/articleshow/87560186.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The Association demand that the Telangana government support itself by reducing taxes in the same way the central government had reduced tariff on diesel by Rs 10 per litre. “Many states in the country have already reduced their share of taxes by Rs 10-12, while the Telangana government is appealing for a reduction in VAT. We demand that diesel also be brought under GST so that fuel prices are uniform across the country,” Association president Rajender Reddy said. Their other demands include providing relief by reducing prices, increase in fares for transporting foodgrains by the civil supplies department. “Problems encountered in sand quarries operated by the Telangana Mineral Development Corporation should be addressed immediately. A discounted price should be fixed for truck owners transporting gravel. Also, a counter signature permit should be issued for traffic between the two Telugu states. The state government should negotiate with its Andhra Pradesh counterpart. With a signature permit, a deduction of Rs 5,000 per year would have been enough, but now each trip costs Rs 1,700,” Reddy added. Lorry drivers also demanded that the state allocate parking space for lorries in major cities and stop imposing fines on lorries for minor issues.  The Association demanded that the state government support itself by reducing taxes in the same way the Centre had reduced tariff on diesel by Rs 10 per litre. Their other demands include increase in fares for transporting foodgrains||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lorry-owners-threaten-stir-over-tax-on-diesel/articleshow/87560192.cms||---

Sources said the municipal administration department had identified some officers for the key post, but they showed reluctance to take up the job. Finally, the mantle fell on Sudarshan Reddy. Sources said orders on his appointment as special commissioner (lakes) will be issued soon. Going by the job profile, it will be a full-time assignment. But, the government is likely to continue Sudarshan as municipal secretary while assigning him with the lakes commissioner post. There are 185 lakes in Greater Hyderabad limits. It was a month ago, municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao had announced that the government would appoint a special officer to oversee the lakes as part of efforts to protect them from encroachments and rejuvenate and beautify them. A GO was issued by the department but it has been a month since the government appointed the special commissioner. Official sources said protection of lakes was a major concern in the city as many constructions had come up in the buffer zone and in full tank level (FTL) of various lakes in the city. “Removal of these constructions, which have come up decades ago, is a herculean task. To make matters worse, dwelling units and encroachments have come up on the drains connected to the lakes, thereby blocking the natural flow of water. As a result, colonies are submerging. Bunds are getting breached during heavy rains in various parts of the city,” a senior GHMC official said. According to the job chart of the lakes commissioner, he should prepare a master plan for each water body by demarcating FTL, buffer zone and green zones. The plan should be prepared to manage the water flow into and from the water body scientifically and manage the sewerage and construction of sewerage treatment plants (STPs) and diversion of treated water, an official said. The commissioner will also initiate relief and rehabilitation for dwellers within FTL and buffer zone and protect and strengthen the bunds and ensure that outfall sluices work properly apart from taking up beautification works, he said. According to the GO, “Since the works need to be inter-departmental and coordinate with the departments like GHMC, HMDA, irrigation, revenue, HMWSS&B and other departments, one circle of water board i.e Hussain Sagar is brought under the control of special commissioner with immediate effect.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sudarshan-likely-to-take-over-as-lakes-commissioner/articleshow/87560181.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Hyderabad||High court junks Andhra Pradesh surgeon’s plea seeking transfer to Telangana||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court has made it clear that options given by the employees of both AP and Telangana at the time of the division of staff among the twin states do not confer any right on them and dismissed a petition filed by Dr Munagala Jyothi, a civil assistant surgeon working in Guntur district of AP seeking a shift to Telangana service. She was allotted to AP at the time of staff division despite her option to work with Telangana. She also cited the spouse ground in support of her claim because her husband, another civil assistant surgeon, is working in Hyderabad. A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A Rajasheker Reddy heard her plea, perused the record, and said that the division that was done in tune with the recommendations of the advisory committee that has experts who were well-versed with the administration and refused to interfere in the process because the petitioner failed to make out any valid case calling for the intervention of the court. When the experts’ committee and the authorities of both states gave ample time to the employees to file their objections to the tentative allocations, the petitioner did not raise any objection at that time, the bench said. The committee and the authorities examined her school education certificates, etc and came to a conclusion that she is a native of AP and allocated her to AP service. The committee suggested the successor states correlate the local candidature/nativity of the employee with the option for allocation along with seniority of the employee and incorporate the same in the guidelines. It is pertinent to note that the term ‘local candidature’ finds a place in both the successor states under the service rules of the employees, the bench said. Another important aspect of the case is that the tentative allocation list was issued on July 14, 2016, giving 14 days time to raise objections. However, the petitioner did not submit any objections against the tentative allocation. The committee has considered the representation of other employees and finally after considering all objections and representations has recommended the final allocation of the list of employees. “Now we cannot interfere in the matter because the petitioner is citing personal difficulties which cannot be taken as a ground at this stage,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-junks-ap-surgeons-plea-seeking-transfer-to-t/articleshow/87560195.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

He is at present a member of the UP Legislative Council. Speaking to reporters at an informal meeting in Gorakhpur, the CM said, “I have always contested elections and I will contest from wherever the party asks me to.” “The party has a parliamentary board and it decides who will contest from where,” he added. Enumerating the positive changes in the state after 2017, he said: “During the 4.5 years of power in the state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) did whatever it had promised in the last assembly election. The party worked in all the sectors and showed it to the people”. On the law and order situation, the CM said that the state had set an example. “During the past 4.5 years, there has been no riot and all festivals, including Diwali, have been celebrated peacefully.” “Diwali used to be celebrated earlier too and Kumbh Mela was not organised for the first time in the state. But Uttar Pradesh was struggling with an image crisis before 2017, which has ended now. The benefits of different schemes have reached the last man in society,” Yogi said. “Deepotsav has been organized in Ayodhya and grand Kumbh in Prayagraj. Similarly, better law and order situation, investment and sufficient opportunity of employment have been ensured in the state. Now, the people of UP will be seen with respect,” he further said. The CM said that the state had become the best destination for investment from abroad in the country due to amazing road connectivity and guarantee of security. He said, “Earlier the investment went outside the country and now investment is coming to the country from outside. Earlier, people used to say that UP starts with potholes and ditches, but now it is known for expressways and a network of four-lane roads.” The CM said that the Purvanchal Expressway would be inaugurated this month itself and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has seen its presentation. “Around 60 lakh jobs have been generated with expressways. During 4.5 years, 4.5 lakh people got jobs and no one could point out any transparency issue.” Describing the death of people of Musahar community in Kushinagar due to hunger earlier, the CM pointed out corruption in food grain distribution in the state before 2017. “UP is the only state where 97% people have expressed satisfaction over distribution of food grain,” he added. He also said that the state bought electricity at the rate of Rs 22 per unit during the coal crisis for smooth power supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/will-contest-in-assembly-polls-if-party-decides-says-yogi/articleshow/87560684.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Anil Deshmukh gets 14-day judicial custody after ED plea rejected||MUMBAI: A special holiday court on Saturday rejected the Enforcement Directorate’s plea for nine additional days of custody of arrested former state home minister Anil Deshmukh (72) in a money laundering case. The court instead sent Deshmukh, arrested last Tuesday, to judicial custody for 14 days. ED is to confront dismissed cop Sachin Waze with the evidence collected during Deshmukh's interrogation. Seeking further custody, the ED said there are 27 companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by Deshmukh’s family members and have been utilized for infusion of ill-gotten money. It also said money has flown from personal accounts of his son Hrishikesh and Salil Deshmukh and other family members to these companies. “Even the accused Anil Deshmukh had transacted with some of the said companies and is not able to explain the reason for that clearly indicates intention behind his denial...,” the ED said. The ED submitted he was evasive and gave vague answers during his questioning over the past four days he was in their custody. Deshmukh told the ED the money his trust received from a Delhi-based hawala operator was a loan. “On asking Anil Deshmukh about his association with the trust, namely Sai Shikshan Sansthan, he said though he is its chairman, he is not aware of any financial transaction of the trust. However, on asking specifically about transferred entries received from Delhi-based hawala companies in the garb of donation, he categorically stated these are loans and CSR received from the said companies. This shows his day-to-day association and involvement in the functioning of Sai Shikshan Sansthan,” the ED said in its remand plea submitted and argued by additional solicitor general Anil Singh. The ED had stated Deshmukh by virtue of his earlier position as state home minister received around Rs 4.7 crore, collected from orchestra bar owners and managers for smooth functioning of bars during the pandemic. Deshmukh’s CA, Sudhir Baheti, had told the ED he had introduced Delhi-based hawala operators to his son Hrishikesh. A total of Rs 4.18 crore, in various tranches, was received by the trust from the paper companies of the hawala operators in the garb of donation, the ED said.  Deshmukh's lawyers Vikram Chaudhri and Aniket Nikam argued the grounds cited by the ED were the same as they had submitted before the first remand hearing on Tuesday. Deshmukh was sent to ED’s custody till Saturday. He is likely to seek bail soon.  The ED said it had summoned a private person who handed over the list of bar and orchestra owners to Waze on Deshmukh's instructions. It said it has moved a plea seeking to question Waze.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-deshmukh-gets-14-day-judicial-custody-after-ed-plea-rejected/articleshow/87560683.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Anil Deshmukh’s son says he is victim, seeks pre-arrest bail||MUMBAI: Alleging that he was a victim of gross persecution, harassment and a witch-hunt campaign, Hrishikesh Deshmukh (34), son of arrested former state home minister Anil Deshmukh, moved the special holiday court seeking anticipatory bail in a money laundering case. The court did not grant him interim relief from arrest and posted the matter to November 12 for the Enforcement Directorate (ED)’s reply. His lawyer said he feared arrest following the manner in which his father was arrested when he went to the ED office last Monday. Hrishikesh was summoned earlier this week. Hrishikesh’s plea said while the ED had alleged Deshmukh was the “number one” at whose behest dismissed cop Sachin Waze was extorting money that was later alleged to have been laundered, in a separate extortion case (now being probed by the crime branch), it is recorded the term was a reference to former police commissioner Param Bir Singh. “In such circumstances, the manner in which the allegations have been twisted against the applicant (Hrishikesh) and his father and the investigations have thus commenced in a shady manner, certainly warrants interference of this court to remedy the wrong committed against him,” the plea submitted by advocate Inderpal B Singh said.  The ED alleged Hrishikesh had been summoned five times and has not turned up once. The pre-arrest bail plea said blatantly false allegations have been levelled by Param Bir Singh and Waze who have no credibility, honour or pride. Advocate Vikram Chaudhri said the alleged transactions cited by the ED, including an asset created by Anil Deshmukh, relate back to about 15 years ago when Hrishikesh was a teenager. He also said the predicate offence, the CBI’s case, relates to alleged abuse of position by Deshmukh as a home minister but the ED’s probes span several years prior to that tenure. Hrishikesh’s plea said he had sent his representative and responded to the summons through replies on July 5, August 2 and 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-deshmukhs-son-says-he-is-victim-seeks-pre-arrest-bail/articleshow/87560686.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Nagpur||Amid demands to allow marijuana crop, its cultivation an open secret||NAGPUR: Lately, farmers in the state have written to district collectors concerned demanding that they be allowed to grow herbal ganja (marijuana). TOI had also reported the case of a farmer in Buldhana making such a demand. Such demands may be raised as a mark of protest against losses in agriculture, but growing the so-called herbal ganja is also a known practice in the hinterland, said sources. It is carried out selectively in a rather clandestine manner, they said. The demands were triggered by the comment of NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik that the alleged marijuana seized from his son-in-law Sameer Khan earlier this year was herbal tobacco. The case once again come into limelight after the Aryan Khan case and Malik’s allegations against Narcotics Control Bureau’s zonal director Sameer Wankhede. Sources said farmers grow the poppy plants but quickly harvest before it flowers. This is because flowers have a strong smell which can attract attention. There are unconfirmed reports of farmers taking up the practice in sugarcane farms or orchards. The plants are grown in between other crops, especially sugarcane, so that it is easily camouflaged. Those having holdings in the interiors go for the crop in small amounts. Even if it is nipped before flowering, the weed is potent enough as a drug, said sources. It’s either used for self-consumption or sold in small amounts. Anil Ghanwat, president of Shetakri Sanghatana, said that he is aware of cases in which some farmers from his area were arrested for allegedly growing marijuana. “It happened around five years ago,” he said. Another leader in Yavatmal confirmed that the practice takes place in the deep interiors. “It is done by farmers who normally do not engage workers from outside and manage the fields with only the family members. This keeps the secrecy.” A veteran in Buldhana too confirmed the development. He too spoke of having known some farmers being arrested. Since it’s a rugged crop, the farmers easily grow it anywhere Kishore Tiwari, chairman of Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavalamban Mission — a state government task force on farm crisis — also confirmed the theory. However, he said the practice is rampant in neighbouring Telangana and not in bordering areas in Maharashtra. Consumption depends on the trend. “Opium consumption is not a practice in Maharashtra. The marijuana grown in Telangana is known to be transported to Uttar Pradesh and other states where its consumption is rampant,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/amid-demands-to-allow-marijuana-crop-its-cultivation-an-open-secret/articleshow/87560201.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Hyderabad||ATM heists: 4 held in Mancherial||Hyderabad: Four persons allegedly involved in stealing nearlyRs 50 lakh cash from ATMs by making the machine malfunction temporarily were arrested by Mancherial police on Saturday. Mancherial police said the accused— Robin Khan, Sahib, Harish, all three from Nuh district, and Ejaj Ahmed Khan, a resident of Palwal — were from Haryana. They were in possession of 30 ATM cards and Rs 2.70 lakh cash was seized from them. They formed a gang and took flights to different places to commit ATM heists. The accused reportedly bought a key from abroad. Using this key, they could open the upper part of an ATM machine. “Using an ATM card, they will make a transaction to withdraw money. When the machine makes the sound of counting notes, before the cash is dispensed, the accused turn off the machine,” Mancherial assistant commissioner of police Akhil Mahajan told TOI. Later, they would call the customer care and lodge a complaint informing that money was not dispensed from the machine. Despite the machine suddenly turning off, the machine would either dispense the cash or allow anyone to insert their fingers into the dispensing slot to pull the cash out. “This slot is there only in some models of ATMs of a particular public sector bank. The accused came to know about it and started committing offences,” the officer said. Before committing two offences on two different dates in Mancherial, the accused were in Chennai, Jaipur and other places and allegedly committed similar offences. The fraud came to light after a bank official lodged a police complaint informing about mismatch in ATM cash. Following this, police deployed personnel at different ATM centres. The four accused went to an ATM where two went inside while the other two were standing outside and telling customers that the machine was not working. On suspicion, a police team went inside and found the ATM machine open. All four were immediately arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/atm-heists-4-held-in-mancherial/articleshow/87560204.cms||---

Singh, head of the Molecular Biology Unit, who is a well-known molecular virologist. His research group contributed significantly in the area of molecular virology. According to him, Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus, transmitted by Aedes mosquito, the same mosquito which causes dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever virus infections. Zika virus can be transmitted from mother to foetus during pregnancy, which may lead to microcephaly (smaller than normal head size) and other congenital malformations in the infant, collectively referred to as congenital Zika syndrome, whereas in adults, the symptoms are mild-fever, headache, conjunctivitis, joint-pain, and body rash. Microcephaly leads to abnormal brain development. The outcomes of microcephaly may differ according to the extent of the brain damage. He said that most people with Zika virus infection do not develop symptoms. The incubation period of ZIKV infection lasts for 2-7 days. In 2015, the major ZIKV outbreak was reported in Brazil, North America, Pacific and South-east Asia, infecting 1.5 million people and with more than 3,500 microcephaly cases reported in infants. In India, 157 ZIKV positive cases were reported in 2018. Currently, there are no definite antivirals against ZIKV and only symptomatic treatment regime is followed. Zika virus infection is also a trigger of Guillain-Barré syndrome, neuropathy and myelitis, particularly in adults and older children. The Zika virus vaccine is at various stages of development at present. According to him, the brain is surrounded by a barrier known as blood-brain-barrier (BBB), which separates the brain from the peripheral blood circulation of the body. The BBB is formed by brain endothelial cells and these cells are held together by protein named tight-junction proteins (TJs) and adherent junction proteins (AJs). If the TJs and AJs proteins expression decreases, the BBB is compromised and allows the movement of immune cells into the brain which causes neuronal damage. The ZIKV infected cells secrete a viral protein, NS1, which has been directly co-related with the disease severity in patients. His study reported that Zika virus NS1 protein treatment compromises the BBB integrity and this may lead to microcephaly and other brain related disorders in infants. The research group reported that Zika virus NS1 protein increases the expression of microRNA-101_3p in human brain microvascular endothelial cells, which in turn suppresses the expression of tight-junction proteins and adherent junction proteins and that leads to the compromise in the integrity BBB. They reported that this could be one of the several mechanisms responsible for compromise in the blood brain barrier in order to facilitate the entry of Zika virus in the brain. “This finding will be very helpful in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of Zika virus and in the therapeutic development. A diagnosis of Zika virus infection can be done by laboratory tests of blood, urine and semen,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/ims-bhu-finding-to-help-understand-zika/articleshow/87560688.cms||Binay Singh
---||Hyderabad||Air pollution behind 10% of eye problems in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: About 10 per cent of all eye problems reported in Hyderabad are linked to air pollution, particularly the high presence of particulate matter and obnoxious gases in the city atmosphere, reveals a research study conducted by LV Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad. According to the study, the most common eye complaint linked to atmospheric pollution is allergic eye disease (AED), which is reported by one in every 10 people visiting ophthalmologists. The researchers have found "a correlation between the meteorological parameters such as environmental temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind speed and pollution with the temporal pattern of presentation of recent onset allergic eye disease (AED)". The researchers said their finding suggests that there is "a clear pattern of certain environmental factors with the temporal pattern of AED in the population of Hyderabad district, with a peak prevalence seen in May and the lowest seen in August. An increase in humidity and rainfall contributes to a lower prevalence of AED cases during the year, whereas an increase in temperature and ozone at ground level conversely contributes to a higher prevalence of AED cases," they said. The research team comprised Anthony Vipin Das and Sayan Basu. The results of the research were published in the scientific journal, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health. "An increase in rainfall and humidity was associated with a lower prevalence, and an increase of temperature and ground-level ozone was associated with a higher prevalence of AED cases during the year among children and adolescents. The highest prevalence was seen in May with 6.09% and the lowest was seen in August with 2.12%. The weather parameters of rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and the pollution parameters of PM10, PM2.5, carbonmonoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and ozone were assessed monthly," the study added. Also, there was a positive correlation with the distribution of particulate matter and the month-wise prevalence of recent onset AED.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/10-per-cent-of-eye-problems-in-city-related-to-pollution/articleshow/87560211.cms||Syed Akbar

With this, the Pink City will get another park as big as Central Park. The civic body will spend approximately Rs 10 crore for the project as announced by the chief minister in the budget speech. The project is expected to increase the city’s green cover. As the city is expanding, the JDA is developing parks for different zones to reduce travel time to use such facilities. Work to develop the park will start as soon as the final design gets prepared by the consultancy firm. "The presentation to develop the park was given on November 3. This will be an extension of the existing park and once developed, it will be one of the biggest parks on the city outskirts," said a JDA official. The official said, "A land has been identified near Kanota and the JDA will be developing it as a park. The park will be a theme-based one and it will have several indigenous species. More than 50,000 shrubs and trees will be planted." Sources said the city had less than 10% of its area under green cover, which is way less than the mandatory 20% required as per the Master Plan 2025. Earlier, the JDA had planned to develop woodland parks and plant trees, but the results were far from satisfactory. The civic body and forest officials said increasing green cover in the city was a herculean task and needed sustained efforts and enough resources. As per the master plan, the entry roads from Delhi, Ajmer, Sikar, and Agra, are supposed to have green corridors of 30 to 45 m on either side of the approaches. However, the project could not be completed due to the unavailability of land. To increase the green cover, the civic has to earmark spaces in its new colonies. "The is the only way to save planted trees. Now as the land was available, planning has been done to plant more trees and increase green cover," the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jda-to-spruce-up-silvan-park-to-increase-green-cover/articleshow/87560214.cms||---

A day after UT reduced VAT on fuel, petrol pumps in Mohali wore a deserted look. Difference in price of petrol in Mohali and Chandigarh has widened by Rs 11.84 per litre. In Mohali, petrol is priced at Rs 106.07 per litre while in Chandigarh, it has been reduced to Rs 94.23 per litre. Diesel is priced at Rs 80.90 in Chandigarh and Rs 89.71 in Mohali, increasing the gap by Rs 8.81 from Rs 3.38 per litre. Ashwinder Singh Mongia, president, Petrol Pump Dealers Association of Mohali said, “This is a major reason for diesel and petrol smugglers to fill their small time tankers of 2,000 lts to 3,000 ltrs from Chandigarh and sell it at higher rates in Punjab. We have been urging petroleum companies to check fuel smuggling in Punjab but they have not done enough. Now, we will seek the intervention of the Punjab chief minister.” In July 2020, Gurkirpal Singh Chawla, a businessman who was once known as the petrol baron of Mohali, committed suicide after incurring huge losses due to cross border petrol smuggling mafia. “I am a victim of corruption, diesel smugglers and officials of a petrol company have connived with petroleum dealers to grab my property and drive me to bankruptcy. Notwithstanding their atrocities, I am committing suicide,” read his suicide note. In his suicide note, Chawla named six persons for driving him to suicide. Panchkula Police booked all six of them on charges of abetment to suicide. The case has hit a dead end. Chandigarh dealers have gained 45% in diesel sales this year and 17% in sale of petrol as compared to their counterparts in Mohali, association members claimed. Fuel dealers in Mohali alleged that they have lost 28% to 32% in diesel sales and 20% to 22% in petrol sales. According to the Petrol Pump Dealers Association in Mohali, continuous drop in VAT rates in Chandigarh since October 2017 resulted in shift of petroleum trade from the bordering districts of Punjab to Chandigarh. Once lowest in Mohali, diesel price has now become highest in the Tricity here at Rs 89.71 per litre. Petrol pump dealers want Punjab government to reduce VAT saying that petrol pumps in Mohali are on the verge of closure. In 2014, diesel was priced the lowest in Mohali but Chandigarh and Haryana reduced VAT while Punjab increased it, sending prices shooting up in Mohali. Ashwinder Singh Mongia, president, Petrol Pump Dealers Association, Mohali said the price of diesel was cheapest in Punjab as compared to neighbouring states till November, 2014 and sale in terms of litres was the highest. VAT on diesel was revised and reduced by Chandigarh administration in November 2014, resulting in a shift of trade to Chandigarh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/as-vat-diff-on-petrol-widens-mohali-dealers-fear-smuggling/articleshow/87559601.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

The Climate Agenda, an NGO working on air pollution and environmental issues, released the post-Diwali air quality report on Saturday. According to Ekta Shekhar of Climate Agenda, the monitoring of air quality was carried out in ten different areas of the city, from 2am on the night of Diwali to 8am the next morning, with the help of low cost air quality monitoring devices. On the basis of this monitoring, Shivpur, Sonarpura, Pandeypur and Madigin localities were the most polluted areas, while Ravindrapuri and Lanka area remained comparatively clean. “Like last year, this year also PM10 was the main pollutant on Diwali,” said Ekta, adding that PM10 in Shivpur area reached the maximum figure of 798 units per cubic meter which was 8 times more polluted than the permissible level. The PM 2.5 level was found to be 401 in this area, which was 6.5 times more polluted than the permissible level. Similarly, PM 10 and PM 2.5 were found to be 7 and 6 times more polluted respectively in Sonarpura. The third most polluted place was the Pandeypur area, which was almost 7 times (PM 10), and 6 times (PM 2.5) more polluted than the permissible level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/air-quality-turns-very-poor-in-some-areas-post-diwali/articleshow/87560694.cms||---

A 35-year-old man opened fire with a country-made pistol that hit a 14-year-old girl sitting on the terrace of a house in Gopalpur village under Mandrayal police station of Karauli on Thursday. The girl was shot dead in an incident, which police claimed to be an accident. However, police have registered a case against the uncle of the girl who managed to flee from the scene. According to the police, the accused, identified as Ranjit, came home drunk on Diwali night and started abusing his elder brother’s family. "While he was threatening and abusing the family of his brother and brought out a country-made pistol, a woman in the family came to request him to put the gun in his pocket. In the jostling, the gun triggered and the bullet pierced into the head of the girl, identified as Mohani, who was sitting on a charpoy on the terrace of her house. The girl succumbed to her injuries on the spot and the villagers informed us," said a senior police officer of Mandrayal police station on Saturday. Police said a team of police officers rushed to the spot to take stock of the situation. "Two families of two brothers live in separate, but attached houses. The younger one, Ranjit, was abusive and had brought a gun," the officer added. Police stated that the accused, soon after the incident, managed to flee from the scene. "Prima facie it appears that bullet was triggered accidentally, but still it is a clear case of murder. We have lodged a case of murder against the accused, who is on the run. Teams have been constituted and he will be arrested soon," the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/minor-girl-shot-dead-during-spat-among-neighbours/articleshow/87560217.cms||---

---||Allahabad||HC seeks expeditious testing of viscera samples||Prayagraj: Taking a serious note of delay in submission of viscera reports adversely affecting investigation of criminal cases, the Allahabad high court has directed the director general of police (DGP), UP, and secretary home, UP to take up this issue at their end for expeditious examination of viscera samples to help the investigating agency so that it doesn’t become an impediment before the courts in deciding matters. A viscera examination tests the internal organs of a body to rule out poisoning or any other abnormality in case of suspicious deaths. Such tests are generally done in cases which are under suspicion like poisoning and dowry deaths. A viscera report is prepared to determine the cause of death under suspicious circumstances where autopsies are unconvincing. Hearing a bail application filed by one Tahir Khan of Jhansi district, Justice Samit Gopal observed, “the examination of viscera is also an integral part of investigation which may provide a link regarding the cause of death or give a lead in the matter. In so far as the offence is concerned, the delay in examination of viscera and due to the same being wanting, the investigating agency forwards reports under the Criminal Procedure Code before the court concerned, on which the courts take cognizance and proceed with the matter and then at some stage the report of viscera is supplemented as document of investigation. In totality of circumstances, investigation remains lacking in the event of non-receipt of report of chemical examiner.” “The delay in examination of viscera is seen not only in this case but in many other cases. Result is thus that the opinion of the investigating officer is lacking in so far as the opinion of expert with regards to viscera is concerned. It is observed that there is no method evolved till date for speedy analysis of viscera so that the investigation may be completed in one go and a report may be filed after its conclusion in whatsoever nature it may be,” the court observed in its order dated October 25. While fixing November 11 as the next date of hearing, the court directed the additional government advocate (AGA) to communicate this order to the officers concerned for its compliance and necessary action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-seeks-expeditious-testing-of-viscera-samples/articleshow/87560710.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey
---||Hubballi||Hectic lobbying for legislative council tickets among various sects in Congress||Dharwad: The heat and dust having settled over the byelection contest to the Hangal and Sindgi assembly seats, senior members and functionaries of the Congress are now lobbying for the tickets to the District Local Authorities Constituency seats in the erstwhile undivided Dharwad district in the Karnataka legislative council. The election to the two seats is slated to be held in January 2022. With Srinivas Mane of the Congress, who previously held the council’s seat for Haveri, now a member of the assembly in the wake of winning the byelection to the Hangal assembly seat, his party will be ever the more eager to retain the seat in the legislative council. Meanwhile, Pradeep Shettar of the BJP is the incumbent of the Undivided Dharwad District Local Authorities Constituency seat, and in the aftermath of electoral reverse in Hangal, the saffron party will want to prevent yet another debacle in the polls to the upper house of the state legislature. Among those eligible to exercise their franchise in the scheduled election are elected members of the gram panchayats, taluk panchayats, town panchayats, urban local bodies, and the respective zilla panchayats. The party’s stunning win in the Hangal bypoll – right in chief minister Basavaraj Bommai’s backyard in Haveri district – has buoyed rank and file of the Congress in the district, and reports indicate that more than a dozen aspirants are knocking on the doors of the party seniors, hoping to bag the ticket. Apparently, prominent leaders of the Muslim community are trying to persuade the Congress high command to declare a Muslim as its candidate. Former minister and veteran Congress leader AM Hindasgeri, who had represented the constituency earlier, is among those eyeing the party ticket. Hindasgeri is a two-time MLA who won the election to the erstwhile Hubli City constituency in 1985, and has twice served as a cabinet minister. He has also been elected to the legislative council from the Local Authorities’ Constituency. Meanwhile, Shakir Sanadi, son of former MP IG Sanadi, Ismail Tamatgar who unsuccessfully contested the Hubballi-Dharwad West assembly constituency and Hubballi-Dharwad City Congress Committee president Altaf Hallur are among the prominent Muslim leaders vying for the Congress ticket for the District Local Authorities’ Constituency seat. Former MLC and Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee member Salim Ahmed, IU Pathan and Subani Chudigar from Haveri are the other contenders. Eager to wrest the monopoly that the BJP has among the Lingayat community in North Karnataka, many members of this influential sect are lobbying hard for the Congress ticket, including Prakashgouda Patil from Hangal, SR Patil from Byadgi, Anand Gaddadevarmath, Sachin Patil and former MLA Shrishailappa Bidaruru. On the other hand, influential voices from among the Dalit community have asked the Congress to demonstrate its commitment to the Scheduled Castes / Scheduled Tribes, by nominating at least two members – one from the Old Mysore region and one in the North Karnataka region – given that as many as 25 seats in the legislative council are going to the polls. KPCC member FH Jakkappannavar, an aspirant for one of the tickets himself, pointed to the representation that the Lingayat community had in Belagavi and Vijayapura districts, and called on the party top brass to nominate members from Dalit sects for the upcoming legislative council elections. Although the Congress had set September 30 as the deadline for the submission of applications by prospective candidates for the council elections, the process was put on the backburner in view of the Sindgi and Hangal bypoll. However, there is demand that the party should invite applications afresh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/hectic-lobbying-for-legislative-council-tickets-among-various-sects-in-congress/articleshow/87560161.cms||GURURAJ JAMKHANDI

The main accused in the case is on the run and the Kovilpalayam police have launched a manhunt for him. An investigation officer said Muneesh, a native of Dindigul, had befriended R Rajasekar at a Tasmac shop and the latter used to allow him to stay in his house at Vilankurichi in exchange for liquor and food. “On Wednesday, Muneesh requested Rajasekar to allow him to stay in his house for a night. When Rajasekar didn’t entertain his demand, Muneesh entered into a heated argument and left the place. He met Rajasekar on Friday along with his friends B Anilkumar and M Rajamani, of Vilankurichi, and attacked him with a knife,” the officer said. The trio, the officer said, had also damaged the window glasses of the house. “Rajamani was rushed to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital with cut injuries to his head and face. Based on his complaint, we registered a case and arrested Anilkumar and Rajamani on Friday itself. Muneesh has gone into hiding,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/two-held-for-assaulting-man-with-knife/articleshow/87560229.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘If schools reopen at once, 700 Covid cases likely daily’||MUMBAI: If schools reopen all at once, the city could witness a rise in Covid cases around 500 to 700 cases a day in few months, according to an analysis by a team from Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR). Prof Sandeep Juneja, TIFR’s School of Technology and Computer Science, said the mathematical model developed by his team showed a “gradual’’ reopening would be better for checking the spread of Covid. “Our graph makes a somewhat obvious case. If you open schools now all at once in Mumbai in January-February, you may see a significant increase in fatalities. This will correspond to 500 to 700 cases a day by mid-December,’’ said Juneja. Over the last two years of Covid, it has become clear that though children get infected by SARS-COV-2, they are more likely than adults to remain asymptomatic. But they can spread the disease, forcing many countries, including India, to shut schools. With the decline of second wave, reopened for older children a month back, in Mumbai, students from Classes VIII to XII started attending offline classes. BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani told TOI schools would reopen in a “staggered manner’’ to avoid crowding. The TIFR team found a “gradual strategy with associated protection measures’’ such as use of masks and maintaining social distancing would be best. “Cases would continue to stay low,’’ said Juneja. But the projections have not taken into account the possibility of a new variant stronger than Delta coming up. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-if-schools-reopen-at-once-700-covid-cases-likely-daily/articleshow/87560717.cms||---

He said smog guns had been installed on a large scale across the city. Rai, who flagged off the tankers outside the Delhi Secretariat on Saturday, said, “Reports show stubble burning incidents are increasing in neighbouring states. About 3,500 incidents of stubble burning were registered on Friday and have crossed 4,000 on Saturday. The effect of pollution caused by stubble burning is still visible in Delhi. Therefore, taking immediate emergency steps, water sprinkling work has been started on the city roads. Smog guns have been installed at a large scale at many places and water is also being sprayed through tankers.” Rai added that 114 tankers have been installed all over the capital to sprinkle water. The minister said that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal launched the Winter Action Plan a month ago to fight against air pollution in Delhi. “The government has been working with Delhhites to control pollution levels. Whether it is pollution from dust, vehicles, biomass or whether it is the work of spraying bio-decomposer solution for stubble management, campaigns have been carried out all over the capital,” Rai said. The environment minister also said that that stubble burning is the highest in Punjab, followed by Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, according to reports. “It is expected that there will be some improvement in air pollution in the next one or two days. But if farm fires increase, its effect will be visible in Delhi, too.” He added that Delhi Police must also take action against those who burst crackers on Diwali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/114-tankers-sprinkling-water-on-city-roads-rai/articleshow/87560730.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

BJP to make Eatala Rajender Telangana unit working president||HYDERABAD: Ecstatic over the party's stunning victory in the crucial Huzurabad assembly bypoll, the BJP is considering appointing TRS rebel Eatala Rajender as working president of the state party unit. BJP sources said a decision on creation of this post will be taken by the central leadership at the party's highest body - parliamentary board - any time soon. Party sources said there was no working president post at the state or national level. But, as an exception and for a specific purpose, the party may create the working president post, the sources added. At the national level, between June 2019 and January 2020, present BJP national president JP Nadda functioned as working president before his elevation, a senior party leader recalled. Eatala himself will be leaving for Delhi on Monday and is likely to meet Union home minister Amit Shah and Nadda either on Monday or Tuesday. If he gets an appointment, he is likely to call on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the sources said. "The party values Eatala's victory in Huzurabad bypoll. While continuing Bandi Sanjay Kumar as president of the state unit, the central leadership may appoint Eatala as a working president since he is a senior leader and a seven-time MLA. He served as a minister and has good connections with Telangana leaders who were active in the separate statehood movement," a senior BJP leader said. Ever since Eatala joined the BJP, the party has been giving importance to the former TRS leader. The BJP national leadership has already made him a special invitee of the national executive committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/poll-optics-bjp-to-make-eatala-state-unit-working-prez/articleshow/87560723.cms||Koride Mahesh

Most of the cases are of dengue and dengue-like illness, where platelets fall. However, Covid tests in PGI have not been reduced. “We need to conduct these tests which are required for the patients to be operated upon. This is as per the guideline of the Government of India. They are all indoor patients,” said a faculty in the PGI virology department. Despite decrease in positivity rate, PGI has been testing over 1,500 Covid samples as most of the indoor/ admitted patients who need surgery need to be tested negative prior to a procedure. PGI has 12 patients admitted, while one patient has been admitted in GMSH-16. “Covid cases have not been reported in our hospital for the last one month. However, there are many cases of dengue. It is expected that within a fortnight or so, these cases will also reduce,” said prof Sudhir Garg, medical superintendent, GMSH 16.  “We will however not do away with the label of the Covid hospital at PGI till there are not a single case in the hospital,” said a faculty in PGI. GMCH 32 and GMSH 16 also conduct Rapid Antigen Tests for Covid. On Friday, 1,008 samples were tested. “These tests are for OPD patients, which gives an idea about positivity in the city,” said a UT health department official.

The name of the documentary is synonymous with not just the humanitarian endeavours of Late Rajaram Pandey on whom it is based, but also with the most revealing selfless creative journey of the director of the film. It would not be an understatement to juxtapose the journeys undertaken by both of them”, said the director, Jai Prakash. The post production of the film took place in the city of Calcutta after the inception of the idea to bring to light the face of the most self-effacing individual who worked tirelessly in building bridges of warmth, love and compassion to reunite people with their loved ones, via, the means of his, ‘ Bhule Bhatke Shivir’. “This aspect of the Maha Kumbh which was conveniently overlooked for quite a few years and hence, the probability of bringing to screen a man who acted as a crusader for uniting was easily negated”, said Prakash. “The efforts of the entire creative team cannot be overlooked. The producer, Sarita Prakash, left no stones unturned in lending support at every stage. The editor of the film, Soumitro Khanra, cannot be thanked enough for all his creative inputs. The cinematographer, Raj Mani Maurya and Assistant Cinematographer, Ankit Kumar, lent the most colorful parlance to it. The Assistant Director, Sanyukta Rai, put in her inputs at various stages and Rohit Yadav gave in his all while conducting the research that was a very prime pillar on which the documentary stands. The production controller, Puneet Verma successfully handled the smooth functioning of the documentary making process," added Prakash. “This documentary showcases the true story of the family traditions and value for which my father spend his life and the detailed projection of his deeds are really appreciable and strikes a chord with the viewers”, said Umesh Chandra Tiwari, son of Raja Ram Tiwari, who had founded and run Bhule Bhatke Shivir for several decades.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/first-prayagraj-documentary-at-intl-film-fest/articleshow/87560736.cms||---

On November 24, over 1,000 youths will stage a protest at AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi’s rally in Uttar Pradesh, said president mahasangh president Upen Yadav. “On November 11, a 50-member delegation will reach Uttar Pradesh to make preparations for November 24 protest. Out of 21 demands, 13 are yet to be fulfilled by the state government. We will oppose Congress rallies wherever Priyanka Gandhiji goes,” he said. Deputy leader of opposition in the state assembly Rajendra Rathore came out in support of unemployed youths saying, “In Jaipur, a large number of unemployed youths are on a dharna under the berozgar sangh’s banner.” “They were forced to celebrate the Diwali festival here (at the protest site), but the Gehlot government is not sensitive to their demands. Ministers in the government are nurturing political interests by giving false assurances time and again,” said Rathore. The third round of talks between representatives of Berojgar Ekikrit Mahasangh and the government over their demands failed on Monday. “We wanted a written assurance from the government about fulfilling our demands, but they refused to do so,” Yadav had earlier said. A six-member delegation of Rajasthan Berojgar Ekikrit Mahasangh on Monday held talks with principal secretary, chief minister’s office (CMO) Kuldeep Ranka, special secretary Aarti Dogra and joint secretary Lalit Kumar. The meeting was also attended by rural development and panchayati raj department principal secretary Aparna Arora and secretary medical education Vaibhav Galriya.

---||Mumbai||In Diwali, Covid cases at lowest in Mumbai & Maharashtra||MUMBAI: The Diwali cheer seemed to have reflected in the state’s Covid update as Maharashtra registered its lowest single-day tally this year with 661 cases on Saturday. The last time that the state had a lower tally (583) was on April 30, 2020.  In Mumbai too, the daily tally dropped to the lowest this year with 176 cases on Saturday. On August 15, the city’s tally dropped to 195 but rose to over 600-plus within the next month as restrictions on train travel were eased. On April 1, 2020, when the pandemic was barely a month old in the country, the city had recorded 151 cases. On Saturday, 10 deaths were registered in Maharashtra, including four in Mumbai, two in Pune, three in Kolhapur and one in Aurangabad. “One of the reasons for the low tally is the drop in daily testing,” said state surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate. “Due to Diwali, people don’t want to get tested. In the last two days, our testing has dropped below one lakh,” he added. The state usually does between 1.2 lakh and 1.5 lakh tests a day. In Mumbai too, only 25,431 tests were done as against 35,000 daily. “Our daily positivity rate is below 0.7% on Saturday. There’s been no sharp rise in cases despite a lot of socialisation and crowding during the festivals,” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. However, he said BMC’s public health system would not lower its guard. “The next fortnight is very crucial for Mumbai as the increased socialisation could lead to an increase in cases,” he said. Health minister Rajesh Tope has on many occasions in the last month said that Covid cases could rise slightly after Diwali. “Given the situation in Europe, where cases sharply increased in the last couple of weeks, we have to be vigilant here as well,” said Dr Awate. However, he said genetic sequencing tests carried out in the state over the last four months had not shown the presence of any new variant of concern.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-in-diwali-covid-cases-at-lowest-in-city-state/articleshow/87560735.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||After Telangana high court jolt, cops scramble to clear 6,000-vehicle pile-up||HYDERABAD: For at least the past five years, police officers in Hyderabad loved to play the finger-wagging school master with people caught driving their car or bike in an inebriated state. The cops would seize the vehicle and return it only after the owner went to court and a counselling session. This would take at least a few days if not more. The counselling sessions stopped in a couple of police commissionerates after the pandemic struck but the seizing of vehicles continued. No wonder then that the three police commissionerates in the city are now left with the task of quickly returning more than 6,000 vehicles after the Telangana high court said that the police did not have the power to make such seizures. The frequency with which vehicles were seized can be gauged from the fact that in 2021 alone, the Hyderabad police commissionerate seized 16,500 vehicles. This effectively means more than 45 vehicles were seized daily and that too in just one police district. The cops also filed charge sheets in 7,269 cases. A senior police officer told STOI, “The order has to be implemented and it will be done.” Did the seizures help in bringing down the number of drunk driving cases in Telangana? The latest National Crime Records Bureau data shows that state saw 1,328 accidents caused by drunk drivers in 2020 - the highest in the country. As many as 343 people died in these accidents, which is the second highest in the country after Uttar Pradesh. On Saturday, officials at the Hyderabad and Cyberabad commissionerates started returning vehicles, one day after the high court order was reported. Sources, however, said the officials are also seeking legal opinion on the court’s order. The maximum number of vehicles were seized in Trimulgherry and Malakpet in Hyderabad. In Cyberabad commissionerate limits, Kukatpally, Madhapur and Rajendranagar saw maximum seizures. The high court, while hearing a clutch of petitions challenging the seizures, said that the police cannot seize vehicles. They should either hand the vehicle over to a co-passenger who has not had alcohol or contact a person, who is known to the drunk driver. A motorist whose blood alcohol count is above 30 mg/100 ml is treated as driving under the influence of alcohol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/after-hc-jolt-cops-scramble-to-clear-6k-vehicle-pile-up/articleshow/87560732.cms||---

Kuppepadavu gram panchayat, about 30km from Mangaluru city, has decided to also impose a Rs 1,000 fine for those dumping waste by the roadside and other public places. Those who share pictures or videos of people throwing garbage will be given Rs 500 as a reward. The initiative of the GP has yielded results within a week that nearly half a dozen black spots in the village, where people used to throw garbage indiscriminately, are now clean. Soon after the GP put up boards at all black spots, people have stopped throwing waste, PDO Savitha Mandolikar told TOI. “People have stopped throwing garbage in public places after seeing the board that we put up,” she said. “The village was facing a lot of difficulties due to the garbage issue since people were throwing waste by the roadside and other public places. Even if we clean such black spots, garbage heaps appeared the very next day,” Mandolikar said. “Hence, the issue was brought to the notice of GP members at a meeting on October 28. A decision was taken to impose a penalty of Rs 1,000 on violators and reward Rs 500 to the informers, whose identity will not be disclosed,” she said. “Boards were put up during a Clean India drive organised with the participation of elected members, GP staff and like-minded people on October 31. We have been noticing that all the black spots are now remaining clean,” she said, adding the village has plans to install CCTV surveillance cameras to impose a penalty on those who throw waste in the village. Sadashiva Kuppepadavu, a farmer who is part of the village’s cleanliness initiatives, said that awareness is being created through social media to keep the village clean. “We have created WhatsApp groups and are sharing messages on cleanliness. We have been encouraging villagers to segregate waste and start manufacturing compost using the wet waste,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/rs-500-reward-for-info-on-litter-bugs/articleshow/87559688.cms||---

An FIR was filed at Jawahar Nagar police station immediately after the incident. SHO Panna Lal Meena said efforts were underway to arrest Saini. Sources in the crime branch informed TOI that Saini’s car also slammed into other vehicles in a bid to flee hurriedly from the scene. “Crime branch sleuths were on a patrol ahead of Diwali. They received a tip-off that Saini was travelling to Raja Park. A crime branch team arrived at the spot at 12.30 am,” said an official. Police units followed Saini’s car which was zipping in and out of narrow lanes. “The car first rumbled along the main road opposite Ramada hotel before racing towards Bhatia Bhawan, and thence moved towards Panchvati,” the official added. Saini’s car then stopped in front of a famous pan shop in Panchvati circle. Police asked him to step out of the car. “Saini was sitting in the back seat. Constables asked him to step out, but the car’s driver slowly reversed the vehicle. All of a sudden, the car tried to slam police unit,” the official said, adding that constables jumped in different directions to save themselves. Constable Rajveer Singh sustained injuries as Saini and his acolytes went on a rampage, hitting other vehicles including motorcycles and fleeing from the scene. An FIR was filed under Sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 307 ( attempt to murder), 427 (mischief causing damage) of the IPC along with other sections of the prevention of damage to public property (PDPP) act. Saini is a history-sheeter of Malviya Nagar police station.

A total 99 cases were reported against 102 on Friday and 114 on Thursday. It was before the second wave in March that the cases fell below 100 in Coimbatore. After the second wave, Coimbatore was reporting the highest number of cases, even surpassing Chennai. Strict Covid restrictions and massive vaccination drives helped the district bring down the cases even when neighbouring Kerala was recording more cases. Over 200 cases were reported throughout August and September before witnessing a slight decline in October. “Fresh cases remained below 200 in the last few weeks and they started declining further from the second week of October,” said a senior health official, who credited it to the vaccination drive. “As the festival is over, we were expecting a marginal increase in cases. But the declining trend is encouraging.

---||Chandigarh||Punjab Engineering College to get advanced lab for use by Tricity researchers||CHANDIGARH: Punjab Engineering College (PEC) will soon be one of the few research institutes in the country where clean room labs will be set up. Researchers from colleges, universities and research centres across the Tricity will also be able to use the Semi Conductor Research Center (Clean Lab) in PEC. The lab will help prepare applications for various private companies in the North region. After IIT Delhi and IIT Mandi, the facility of clean lab will be available in PEC. The foundation of the special project was laid during the time of former administrator V P Singh Badnore. In about two years, a Mumbai-based private company prepared a clean lab at a cost of more than Rs 5 crore. On November 16, on the completion of 100 years of PEC, President Ram Nath Kovid, who will attend the centenary year celebrations, will inaugurate the special lab. These days, final touches are being given to testing work in the lab. Private companies have started approaching PEC for the lab. Private companies will have to pay for use of the lab. According to experts, having a clean lab for the first time in the Tricity will give researchers a chance to test their research in the lab practically and not just on computer. The lab will be useful for MTech and PhD research scholars. Some of the advanced machines installed in the lab have been sourced from a Bangalore-based company and some are from the US. The cost of each machine is Rs 35 lakh to Rs 65 lakh. The lab has been prepared under the supervision of Dr Arun Kumar Singh. Private company or institutes will have to pay by the hour. According to sources, the daily cost of maintenance of the lab is around Rs 50,000 and 10 to 15 persons will be able to work in the lab at a time. According to research scholars Sahil Garg, Gaurav and Raghav, the lab will be a milestone for research in the Tricity. The private sector will also stand to benefit a lot from this. Presidential tour preparations begin:President Ram Nath Kovid will be the chief guest at the PEC centenary year celebrations. Preparations have started in full swing for his visit. On Saturday, officials were asked to get the Century Gate Community Center, being built in PEC ready by November 10. Ground is being cleared for the pandal.UT adviser Dharampal visited PEC to review the preparations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pec-to-get-advanced-lab-for-use-by-tricity-researchers/articleshow/87559690.cms||---
---||Goa||ISL threatens clubs with points deduction for flouting salary cap||Panaji: Indian Super League (ISL) clubs are divided over the salary cap. While three clubs are understood to have told the league organisers to remove the salary cap and give them the freedom to sign the players that they want, four insisted on the cap being there. The rest weren’t really bothered since the rules were not being followed either way. “We think that it’s necessary to have a salary cap since it brings balance to the league,” said a senior club official. “If it’s removed, it will become more of a financial battle, rather than football. The teams who have the financial strength to spend much more than any of us will simply blow away the competition. It will be uneven.” Salary cap is the maximum expenditure a club is permitted to spend on player signings. It includes individual performance bonus (exclusive of team bonus), agent/intermediary fees and separate arrangements with players. Clubs can spend a maximum of Rs 16.5 crore on player signings, but it’s no secret that some have spent more. Last season, clubs were issued a warning. Now, the punishments will be stricter, and it’s all on record. “Any club found to have exceeded the salary cap, knowingly or otherwise, shall be liable for action/sanction by the league, with possible penalties including without limitation, any or all of the following: fine; and/or deduction of points,” states article I(XX) of the ISL Coach & Player Selection Guidelines 2021-22. Despite the tightening of rules, sources said there are enough ways to spend more, if clubs are willing. “There are obvious loopholes and signing players on loan is the biggest one,” said another official. “We can understand that transfer fees are outside of the cap, but how can you exclude loan fees? There are some teams who have signed players with zero value to the cap, since loan fees, most of the times, includes player salaries.” According to the guidelines, “if a loaned player’s salary/fee is absorbed all or in part by the parent club, this amount will not be considered as part of the salary cap components for the salary cap value with respect to that player.” The components for each player that contributes towards the salary cap value is exclusive of GST (Goods and Services Tax) but inclusive of all other applicable taxes. For foreign player signings, though, the league has not specified whether the contract values are gross or net (after deduction). The salary cap has its opponents with clubs insisting that the rule restricts them from making quality foreign signings. “The cap makes no sense. Even in continental competitions, Indian clubs won’t make too much of progress because others are signing better quality foreigners. “Clubs are given the freedom to sign marquee names, whose salary won’t be counted among the cap. But marquees are not needed now. What we need are quality players, and to attract the good ones, we need to spend more,” said one official. Organisers say the salary cap helps in managing the cost of signing players, or else remunerations will reach “unsustainable levels.” “There is a need to maintain a healthy competitive balance,” the league states in its guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/isl-threatens-clubs-with-points-deduction-for-flouting-salary-cap/articleshow/87573365.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Police have also recovered a suicide note in which the boy has stated that he was weak in studies and could not cope up with the pressure and thus ended his life. According to the police, the uncle of the boy identified as Saurabh, has given a report at the Bagad police station stating that at 10.30pm on Wednesday, the boy had gone to his room to sleep. “On Thursday morning, the family did not find him in the room he used to sleep in. Thereafter, the boy’s mother informed the family members and the family enquired about him in the village, but did not find him,” said a senior police officer of Bagad police station on Saturday. Meanwhile, the family found a suicide note under the pillow in the room in which the boy used to sleep. “In the suicide note, the boy while apologising to his parents stated that he could not live up to the expectations of his parents since he was not good at studies. Thus, he ended his life. Thereafter, the family members found his body in the water tank situated in the house of his neighbour,” said an officer. Police stated that prima facie, the case appears to be of suicide, but they are also probing the murder angle. “Prima facie, it appears to be a clear case of suicide. However, it is to be investigated under what circumstances the boy reached the house of his neighbour in the night that his body was found in the water tank there,” the officer added. Family stated that Saurabh was good in studies and was watching T20 cricket match with his uncle on Wednesday. “We will probe other angles into the case as well,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/14-year-old-boy-commits-suicide-in-jhunjhunu-cops-to-probe-murder-angle/articleshow/87560257.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Farm fires at season’s high, share in bad air jumps too||NEW DELHI: Saturday recorded the highest single-day effective harvest stubble burning count at 5,159. The share of farm fires to Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution level also rose from 36% on Friday to 41% on Saturday, according to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research, the Union earth sciences ministry’s forecasting body. The effective fire count comprises the number of fires that can impact Delhi’s air.  Though the harvest remnant burning has reached its peak now, its cumulative share to Delhi’s PM2.5 has been lower this year than the previous two years. Track the pollution level in your cityAccording to SAFAR’s data, the cumulative share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 in 62 days of the harvesting season (October 10-December 10) in 2019 was 9,821 micrograms per cubic metre, rising to 10,067 micrograms per cubic metre in 2020. This year, due to the delayed withdrawal of the monsoons and periodical rainfalls in October, the share has remained much lower. SAFAR’s Gufran Beig said, “The share of stubble burning to Delhi’s air varies daily according to wind direction and wind speed.” For instance, November 5, 2019 logged the highest single-day fire count at 5,300 but the share of the fires in Delhi’s PM2.5 pollutants was just 10%. On the same day a year earlier, however, there were a much fewer 2,190 farm fires, but their contribution to Delhi’s PM2.5 was reckoned at 58% because the wind direction and speed were favourable for the transportation of pollutants. According to data from NASA’s satellite imagery, 30,552 farm fires have been sighted in Punjab between September 1 and November 5 this year compared with 48,412 in 2020, 30,665 in 2019 and 29,133 in 2018 in the same period. In Haryana, 6,051 stubble burning incidents have been recorded between September 1 and November 5 this year while the number of farm fires was 4,000 in 2020, 4,937 in 2019 and 5,165 in 2018 in the same period. Pawan Gupta, senior scientist, earth sciences, Universities Space Research Association at NASA, said, around 6,000 farm fires were recorded in Punjab on Friday. He told TOI, “The cumulative count of farm fires between September 1 and November 5 this year is lower when compared with 2020, but it is close to the figures for 2018 and 2019. It appears that a lot of the harvest remnants is still left to burn and the fire counts are expected to be higher this week. However, the number of fires will start decreasing from next week.” Chandra Bhushan, CEO, International forum for environment, sustainability and technology (iForest), added, “Due to the delayed withdrawal of the monsoon from the region, we are only now reaching the peak of stubble burning in the neighbouring states. We cannot control Delhi’s high pollution level without addressing the problem of the farm fires in the neighbourhood. Apart from stubble burning, other forms of biomass burning also have to be addressed to check air pollution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/farm-fires-at-seasons-high-share-in-bad-air-jumps-too/articleshow/87560759.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The state government has assured to help him and district collector G S Sameeran is scheduled to meet him in person on Sunday at his house at Athupollachi, which is about 12km away from Pollachi. Radhakrishnan said it was his resolve to offer a dignified life to his disabled mother that helped him crack NEET. His mother Mahalakshmi, a daily wage labourer, had toiled hard to raise him and his younger brother. He said his relatives had ridiculed her a few years ago when his father left them in the lurch. “No one could think of becoming a doctor in my family circle and this was also a reason for me to take up NEET. I was expecting 380 marks, but I secured 406. I am satisfied with my performance. But I need to wait for counselling for a medical seat,” Radhakrishnan, who belongs to Mudugar tribal community, said. Vari Medical Academy, a NEET and JEE training centre at Saravanampatti, has offered to support Radhakrishnan with fees when he gets the MBBS seat. It was at this academy that Radhakrishnan underwent training for NEET for the past one year. Dr P Lokesh, founder of the coaching centre, said they hadn’t charged Radhakrishnan for coaching, as he could not afford the fees. “We considered him as he was a brilliant candidate with the capability to clear the test.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/medical-aspirant-from-tribal-community-sets-eyes-on-govt-seat/articleshow/87560256.cms||Sampath Kumar

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: I-T freezes Rs 54cr in Buldana credit soc for ‘irregularities’||Mumbai: The income tax (I-T) department has frozen Rs 54 crore deposits in Buldana Urban Cooperative Credit Society over alleged irregularities in opening of accounts without following KYC (know your customer) norms. The I-T department has identified 1,200 such accounts where multiple cash deposits of Rs 1.9 lakh each were made, totalling Rs 54 crore, stated a press release issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes. Of these, the release stated, more than 700 accounts have been identified which were opened in a series where cash deposits of more than Rs 34.1 crore were made immediately within seven days of the opening of accounts, mainly between August 2020 and May 2021. These deposits have been structured to avoid the mandatory PAN requirements for cash deposits of over Rs 2 lakh. The money was subsequently converted into fixed deposits in the same branch. The release further said, “The Chairman, CMD and the manager of the branch, could not explain the source of cash deposits and accepted that these were done at the behest of one of the directors of the bank, who is a prominent local businessman engaged in trading of grains. The account opening forms were filled in by the bank staff and they have put their signature or thumb impression.” The I-T department had searched premises of its chairman along with one of the directors recently. The society came under the I-T scanner during an investigation of its loan to a Nanded-based sugar mill connected with former chief minister Ashok Chavan. He had denied the allegations and said all banking norms were followed. Shirish Deshpande, CEO of the society, said, “Many of our account holders are poor farmers who don’t possess PAN cards. All our account holders are genuine customers. Sometimes these farmers-workers open accounts hiding from their spouses. So, it’s natural that if someone inquires about the spouse of an account holder, they will not get accurate information.” He further said, “Our loans to the four sugar mills in Nanded were regular loan transactions and there were not any irregularities in it.” The I-T department alleged that during the examination of the data on core banking solutions (CBS) records at the society’s headquarters in Pune, they found around 1,200 accounts had been opened without PAN card and KYC verification. During the investigation, I-T officials traced a few such account holders, who reportedly told them they were unaware about the opening of the accounts and fixed deposits in their names.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-i-t-freezes-rs-54cr-in-buldana-credit-soc-for-irregularities/articleshow/87560780.cms||Vijay V Singh

---||Mangaluru||Mangaluru: Man who made dessert a meal, leaves behind cool memories||MANGALURU: For most people, a visit to Mangaluru is incomplete without stepping into an Ideal Ice Cream parlour. The passing away of the founder of the establishment, S Prabhakar Kamath, who was popularly known as ‘Pabba Maam’, has left not only his near and dear ones, but also those with a sweet tooth, shattered. Kamath set out to make the best ice cream possible. He taught himself the art of ice cream making, and conducted experiments at home, testing his creations on enthusiastic neighbours, before opening the first Ideal’s Parlour on Market Road in Mangaluru on May 1, 1975. Kamath, who started out in business dealing in general items, saw seasonal fluctuations in the business, and this made him think of a more secure line of business, that would be in demand throughout the year. Hence, he decided to start an ice cream parlour in spite of there being fierce competition in the segment. Until then, ice creams were meant to be a scoop, cup or a slab, but Kamath is credited with making ice creams a meal. The ice creams he has created are rich in nuts, fruits and dry fruits. Since the beginning, innovation has been a mainstay of Ideal. It’s famous ice cream concoction ‘Gadbad’ a blend of flavours, fresh and dry fruits and mixed fruit jelly, bears testimony to this. ‘Gadbad’ became so popular, that the ice cream dessert has now become a generic name, and imitations of this can be found in most of the ice cream parlours in the coastal belt. Gadbad was a product available in Udupi, but was known as ‘Gadibdi’ in Kannada, and it became an instant hit in Mangaluru. Close to Gadbad in terms of sale is Parfait. The ice cream flavours in Parfait vary when compared to Gadbad, and is a little expensive. They both account for close to 60% of parlour sales. Mukund Kamath, the son of Prabhakar Kamath, says, “What’s significant about Ideal Ice Cream is that it is 100% vegetarian. No egg is used. Just pure fresh milk, cream and a secret formula that remains within the family.” Mukund, along with his father, introduced Tiramisu another popular product, and they believe that more than creating an ice cream, naming it is a challenge. They are also credited with introducing I-Thali or an ice-cream thali. “In recent time, Ideal Ice Cream has diversified its product portfolio to include a number of retail products. These include ice candies, chocobars, ice lollies, choconutz, ice cream cones, ice cream sundaes and cups in a variety of flavours. To this day, Ideal Ice Cream remains committed towards developing exceptional new super premium ice cream experiences, releasing new flavours every year,” he said. Ideal Ice Cream had bagged eight medals in season six of the Great Indian Ice Cream and Frozen Dessert competition held in Gurugram in 2017. Ideal Ice Cream had won the maximum award among the 103 participants from across India. ‘Pabba Maam’ indeed leaves behind sweet an cool memories. Following the demise of the septuagenarian, Union minister of state for entrepreneurship & skill development Rajeev Chandrasekhar tweeted: “Thank you for all the sweet memories.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/man-who-made-dessert-a-meal-leaves-behind-cool-memories/articleshow/87559705.cms||---

The party has officially added the new agenda in its statewide series of protests to push the state for slashing VAT which is among the highest in the country. State BJP president Satish Poonia in a series of tweets questioned, why only non-BJP governments are not reducing the VAT while all BJP-ruled states have done it to bring respite to the common man. “The state government has no excuse now to reduce the VAT when the central government has done its job by slashing excise duty. It is now the people of the state to judge how the state is creating an obstacle in way of the relief provided to them,” said Poonia. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-has-no-excuse-to-cut-vat-retorts-bjp/articleshow/87560789.cms||---

Addressing people in Auraiya and Etawah, the CM also said that the public needs to stay alert from people with ‘criminal mindset’ as they are least bothered about the problems faced by the people. The CM said, “Sardar Patel is the one who united the country. Jinnah had ruined the country, both cannot be equal,” said CM further and added, “Sardar Patel is the hero of the nation, but Jinnah had led to the division of the country. We all have to be wary of those who are going on making a comparison of Sardar Patel with Jinnah.” He also said, “You all have given them opportunities in the past but all went in vain. Such shameful and reprehensible statements and such people should be rejected. You must understand their dirty mindset and stay alert from them. For their political interests, they are shaking hands with the ‘mafias’.” While in Auraiya, he laid the foundation stone of Government Medical college to be constructed at a cost of Rs 280 crore. He also laid the foundation stone of 12 development projects worth Rs 109 crores. In Etawah, he inaugurated the Central prison equipped with modern facilities built at a cost of Rs 272 crores and launched various development projects worth Rs 575 crore. Addressing a gathering at Numaish Pandal in Etawah, the CM said, “Earlier, people were afraid to go to Ayodhya because bullets were fired on Ram Bhakts there, but today the same Ayodhya is lit up with lakhs of Diwali lamps, Ayodhya is getting famous all over the world.” The CM further said, “Earlier, money used to go for the boundary of the ‘kabristan’ (graveyard), now it is being spent for the betterment of the people of the state through various projects. Also, the restoration work of 700 temples has been started.” “During the Corona period, we were present with all our public representatives to strengthen the system here. But, the people of other parties remained confined in their homes during the time of crisis, now they should remain in their houses even during the time of elections. These people were limited to Twitter only. And tell ‘Babua’ that only Twitter will help him get votes,” said the CM. The Chief Minister said that the BJP government not only laid the foundation stone but also inaugurated it. “Today, I am present among you to inaugurate the projects for which the foundation stone was laid three years ago. Today, on the occasion of Bhai Dooj, I heartily congratulate all the citizens of Etawah district for the projects costing about five hundred and fifty crore rupees and I congratulate all of you.” Yogi said that till 2017 there were only 12 medical colleges in the state. “Now there are 58 medical colleges,” he said. Asserting that the government is standing with the distressed farmers, Yogi said he had visited Auraiya a few days ago, when the district was experiencing floods and the crops of the farmers were damaged, houses were destroyed. The government has given compensation to every person, every farmer who suffered due to floods. The government is standing with the distressed farmers. Hitting the opposition, Yogi said that during the Samajwadi government development was limited to Etawah only. People should question why there was no development in Auraiya.  He said, erlier there was competition to include the mafia in the party. Today, bulldozers are being used against the mafia elements and their protectors. The CM commented that there used to be frequent riots during the festivals, curfew used to be imposed and people could not celebrate festivals. Now, no riots took place in UP in the last four and a half years because the rioters were aware of the dire consequences. Expressing gratitude towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the CM said, “On the occasion of Diwali, PM Modi has drastically cut the prices of petrol and diesel.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/cm-yogi-be-wary-of-people-who-are-comparing-sardar-patel-with-jinnah/articleshow/87560793.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

For instance, in Hindalga prison, 181 inmates do not know how to read and write Kannada. The literate prisoners will teach them Kannada alphabets, sentence formation and basic grammar. The adult education department has supplied books and will also pay the trainers educating the illiterates. The programme was kick-started on Monday and has received good response from prisoners with jails donning the look of schools. The inmates are enthusiastically taking part in the programme and some are learning the alphabets very fast. The department has identified hundreds of educated inmates who have completed SSLC, PUC and graduation and assigned them to groups for teaching. The sessions are conducted both in day and night hours at the barracks. The trainers and students are provided with pencils and books to write down the letters. The aim is to make them read and write before they leave the prison. Hindalga central prison chief superintendent of police Krishna Kumar told TOI that the programme is executed jointly with the adult education department. “Now it is in the nascent stage and currently attracting more prisoners both to learn and teach. The trainers are paid a handsome remuneration for their work by the government. The programme is run across 101 prisons in the state,” he said. In Hindalga, there are over 100 inmates who have completed SSLC and 18 have completed BA. “We are seeing them as resources to engage in the programme.

Most cops appear to be inclined towards reading non-fiction, which, besides improving their knowledge of key subjects, may help them perform well in competitive examinations. Retired police personnel too seem to be flocking to the library, browsing through its collection at their leisure. Constable and writer Somu Reddy told TOI that many constables had appealed to their superiors to set up a library exclusively for police personnel. “The library came into being in July, and it has become a place where we go to relax. Instead of getting addicted to vices, we can improve our life by reading books at the library,” Reddy said. Basavaraj Biradar, the librarian, said that the number of people trooping into the library was witnessing an incremental rise since it opened its doors. “We have 740 books in our library, of which nearly 90% is non-fiction, reading which will help candidates crack competitive examinations such as Karnataka Administrative Services, Union Public Service Commission, etc. We also have novels, collection of poems. The library opens at 9.30am to 1pm, and again from 4pm to 8pm. The library is closed on Saturday. Many constables and their children are regularly,” he said. Vinayak, a high-school student who visits the library regularly, said, “While the library has many good books, I wish there were more titles for children. Since Saturday is a half-day for us, we wish the library stays open that day as well.”  ‘Hope more cops use it’ We were able to establish this facility with the help of the library department. We hope more cops use the facility. - Labhu Ram | Police Commissioner, Hubballi-Dharwad||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/response-to-library-set-up-exclusively-for-cops-encouraging/articleshow/87559518.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

Similarly, Mussoorie also received a high number of visitors over the Bhaidooj weekend. “The high tourist footfall has brought cheer for us as the business had dropped to zero after tourists left the area in panic for fear of rain-related incidents. The pleasant weather conditions also helped. We hope that tourism remains steady in the lake town now,” said Sameer Sah, a Nainital-based hotelier. In Nainital, tourists thronged Mall Road, Pant Park, Himalaya Darshan point, Naina Devi temple, Naini Lake, and other tourists spots in the town. Due to the tourist rush, the city's main parking lot at DSA Ground was packed and the vehicles were later moved to Metropole car parking. To manage traffic, the district administration deployed additional police units at major tourist spots. Meanwhile, local shopkeepers, especially those selling winter garments, and boatmen recorded a significant jump in business. Kailash Mishra, a local shopkeeper, said, “The sales had plummetted dramatically after the devastating rain spells on October 18 and 19. Therefore, a rise in tourist footfall provides us the much-needed relief. In the last few days, our business has picked up. Hopefully, the trend will continue.” Rekha Raj, a tourist from Kashipur, told TOI, “My family and I were nervous about the situation in Nainital but the weather is very pleasant here and we see no natural calamity threat. It is delightful to be here at this time of the year.” In Mussoorie too, a heavy tourist turnout was recorded. While the hoteliers reported 70-to-80% occupancy for the Bhaidooj weekend, traffic jams were observed near Gandhi Chowk and on Moti Lal Nehru road due to the tourist rush. “We have been observing a good tourist turnout this weekend. Around 70-to-80% of hotel rooms are booked. A majority of tourists have come from Gujarat. We hope that their arrival continues for another week or so,” said Sanjay Aggarwal, secretary of Mussoorie Hotels Association.

The doctors claimed that they are witnessing increasing number of patients in which worsening of symptoms is being seen. “Some patients who had lung fibrosis or their lungs were affected due to Covid, are coming to the hospital. This is the time when patients with lung diseases or those suffering from other respiratory diseases should remain alert as the weather is changing. Bursting of crackers has also affected the air quality,” said Dr Ajit Singh, superintendent, RUHS Hospital. TimesViewThe Supreme Court allowed people to celebrate Diwali with green crackers but Jaipur residents failed to stick to such crackers only. On Friday, the city choked from pollution-causing crackers burst on Diwali night, pushing the AQI to 364 and breaching the ‘very poor’ category. In 2020, Covid badly hit festival celebrations but 2021 gave us an opportunity to celebrate again. Residents should have given a thought to Covid patients who are still on oxygen support in houses and be considerate towards elders and children who are vulnerable to air pollution.Dr Singh said that pollution has worsened symptoms of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and other allergies. “The rise in AQI post Diwali indicates the contribution of crackers in the worsening air quality,” said Dr Virendra Singh, pulmonologist and former superintendent SMS Hospital. However, doctors have suggested that patients should remain careful as the changing weather and pollution can take a toll on their health. “Crackers causes pollution and emit noxious gases which is not good for patients already suffering from respiratory diseases,” said Dr CL Nawal, senior professor (medicines), SMS Hospital. Doctors said that crackers affect the health of vulnerable category. The air quality in the city had dipped a day after Diwali to very poor category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/docs-to-lung-patients-take-precautions-as-air-quality-has-deteriorated/articleshow/87560798.cms||---

---||Dehradun||After HC prod, authorities prepare list of illegal settlers on irrigation land in Haridwar||Haridwar: After the Nainital high court’s intervention on a public interest litigation (PIL), district administration and irrigation departments of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand have jointly prepared a list of illegal settlers on irrigation land on the banks of Ganga in Bairagi camp in Haridwar. As per the list, a total of 658 persons, including those from social and religious institutions, have built kutcha and pucca houses on the land. Three Bairagi akharas, many ashrams and social and religious organisations have illegally occupied the land, according to the list, which is likely to be submitted before the court on Monday, said officials. Social activist, Dharmveer Saini, said he moved the apex court, seeking removal of encroachments on irrigation land in Haridwar after district administration and irrigation department failed to take action despite several complaints. Following which, the court directed Haridwar district magistrate and irrigation departments of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh to submit a report before November 11. Speaking to TOI, complainant Dharmveer Saini said, “I moved the high court because district administration and irrigation department were not serious about the issue. Ashrams have come up, with the influential having encroached upon the land. Unfortunately, illegal encroachment hasn’t stopped. I have urged the court to remove all illegal buildings from the irrigation land as this land is part of the Ganga.” On the other hand, district administration is claiming that encroachments are not new and that officials are taking action. DM Haridwar Vinay Shankar Pandey told TOI, “No new encroachment has come up and encroachments dot the land since years. Why wasn’t any action taken earlier? All I can say is a list is being prepared and notices have been issued by the irrigation department to the illegal occupants.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/after-hc-prod-authorities-prepare-list-of-illegal-settlers-on-irrigation-land-in-haridwar/articleshow/87559784.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Kanpur||Inspector held for alleged rape of dowry complainant||Kanpur:An inspector has been accused of raping a woman complainant for several times in a hotel on the pretext of helping her. The woman, a native of Etawah, is a victim of dowry harassment, and came in contact with an inspector during his posting at Civil Lines police station in January 2021 in Etawah. The matter came to light when the married woman became pregnant. On the complaint of the victim, the police arrested the accused inspector from Kulpahar Kotwali in Mahoba district. She was a minor when she was raped. Therefore, the police have also imposed a section of the POCSO Act on the inspector along with rape. A newly married woman from a village under Bhareh police station area of Etawah district had met SSP (Etawah) Jai Prakash Singh that some time ago she had made a complaint of dowry harassment against her husband at the local police station. The police intervened and both sides had compromised. The police station in-charge Mahendra Pratap Singh, who was posted at Bhareh police station, was later transferred to Chakarnagar police station. The in-laws of the victim also hail from Chakarnagar. According to the victim, on reaching there, the accused station in-charge forcibly registered a case of dowry harassment against her in-laws and started pressurizing her to come to the police station. When she reached the police station on Jan 28 2021, she was asked to go to the Etawah court to give a statement. On that day, the inspector took her to a hotel located on Station Road, saying that there will be no statement recorded on that day and later he raped her and also made her obscene photos and videos from his mobile phone. The inspector also threatened to send her husband to jail if she complained about the matter. On February 7, inspector Mahendra Pratap Singh again raped her after calling her to a hotel in Etawah. The victim, peeved over the sexual exploitation by the inspector had made a complaint to the then SSP on October 4. The investigation of the case was handed over to CO Rakesh Vashisht. When no action was taken, the victim had lodged a complaint with SSP Jai Prakash Singh on Thursday. SSP said that in the case, the accused has been arrested from Mahoba and sent to jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/inspector-held-for-alleged-rape-of-dowry-complainant/articleshow/87560814.cms||---

The block will be held on the down harbour line between CSMT-Chunabhatti/Bandra, from 11.10 am to 4.40 pm. CR’s chief PRO Shivaji Sutar said, “Maintenance of signalling, telecommunications, track, overhead wire, etc, are to be carried out.” CR introduced mega blocks on the main line in October 1997, and on the Harbour line in April 2000. They usually last three to five hours during the day on weekends, when passenger count is lower. A senior official said, “Due to poor visibility at night, daytime blocks are preferred to ensure proper maintenance.” Some passengers are inconvenienced, but railway authorities make advance announcement of block timings and sections, so that commuters can plan their travel better. Blocks are also announced while dismantling old bridges and foot over bridges (FOB), as well as for their construction, since such work cannot be undertaken on running lines. An official said, “Mega blocks are necessary, as lack of maintenance can lead to increase in failures and major disruption in services.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-today-cr-to-hold-its-3000th-mega-block/articleshow/87560844.cms||Manthank Mehta

---||Goa||Soon, Goa Medical College to have cadaveric skin bank||PANAJI: The department of plastic surgery has proposed to have a skin bank in GMC to help patients reporting with severe burns of over 60% to 70%, having weak chances of survival. Skin grafts can help such patients and reduce mortalities. “We have proposed to set up the skin bank so that patients having extensive burns can be saved. Overall burn incidents have dropped but people suffering burns in factory accidents have not. Those patients come with severe injuries and skin grafting can be of help to them,” said Dr Yuri Amborcar, head of plastic surgery department, GMC. The skin bank will operate on same lines as a cadaveric organ donation, complying with certain guidelines. “Skin donation is done post-mortem but if a neonate has burns, a mother can donate her skin,” Dr Amborcar said. The skin stored in the bank with proper medium can be used up to five years. The GMC has got an approval to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with National Burns Centre, to set up a skin bank. The National Burns Centre, he said has a licence from the Euro skin bank. “It will share expertise for setting up skin bank in the GMC. Our staff including some doctors, nurses and multi-tasking staff were trained at the National Burns Centre,” he said. Though the GMC is gearing up to set up the bank, it will take some time for it to see its plan fructify. “We will have to wait for a while since the space allotted for the bank needs to be included in the plans,” he said. Annually, plastic surgery department records about 150-180 cases, with four to five factory related severe burn incidents. Cases involving cooking gas explosions also show up with extensive burns, and with poor prognoses though in the last few years, the department has succeeded in reducing mortalities among patients with 30 to 60 percentage of burns. The plastic surgery department will be shifted to the new super speciality block that is currently used as a Covid-19 facility. The super speciality block was converted into Covid hospital in late May after hospitals in Goa ran out of beds. While shifting of GMC’s super specialities to the new block was delayed owing to pandemic, they are likely to be moved there in next two months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/soon-gmc-to-have-cadaveric-skin-bank/articleshow/87560299.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: 17-year-old girl helps transgender father earn acceptability in village||JAIPUR: Pooja (name changed) is a 17-year-old girl living in a village in Dungarpur district. Her family is a little different from others. Her father Mohan (name changed) is a member of LGBTQ+ and has been mocked and discriminated in the village. Around a year ago, she joined Feminist Adolescent Youth Action (FAYA) and Jatan Sansthan. Through this, not only did she accept her own father’s preferences of cross dressing, but also ensured that villagers accepted the same. Since then, rather than being laughed at, the family is able to run a ‘kirana’ store along with being able to send children to school. “Today, I am humbled to be considered as a changemaker who has created social awareness. It gives me immense happiness that others find inspiration in my story and it has encouraged others to ask for their right to live with dignity without any shame and mockery. Today, thanks to my family’s courage, my father interacts with his peers in the village with his head held high. And even I’m pursuing higher studies in class 12 with determination”, said Pooja. She recalls, “Nobody liked to associate with our family at one point. We were ostracised and during festive occasions, my mother was not invited to take part in any ceremonies. We lived in a constant state of acute stress.” Then one-and-a-half years ago, Pooja (name changed) connected with the activities of FAYA, which is an initiative to spread awareness about adolescent sexual and reproductive health across 50 villages in Dungarpur region. It was here that she learnt that human bodies are not necessarily just male or female, that gender can be fluid and that a human-being can have a third gender identity that is neither feminine nor masculine. When her core group began to discuss these issues openly, not only did her own awareness expand but others too became sensitive to these issues. Armed with this knowledge, she began to communicate these ideas with others in her community. The result of the FAYA sessions is that now none of Pooja’s peers make fun of her or her family and the environment within the community is improved. The family has a kirana (grocery/general) store.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/17-year-old-girl-helps-transgender-father-earn-acceptability-in-village/articleshow/87560843.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Corp spent Rs 2.41cr for ABC project||Thiruvananthapuram: The civic body is the biggest spender among six city corporations in the state in conducting animal birth control (ABC) project; spending Rs 2.41 crore to sterilize Rs 12,715 dogs between 2016-17 and 2021-22, as per the latest figures presented in the assembly. Since 2016-17, the funds being spent on animal birth control have increased phenomenally leaping from Rs 8 lakhs in 2016-17 to 73 lakhs in 2020-21. There has also been a proportionate increase in stray dogs being sterilised. While figures speak well of the corporation’s efforts at ABC, a shadow of doubt has been cast over the survival rate of stray dogs post-surgery. Even when the corporation has been able to step up spending and the number of stray dogs being sterilized, animal welfare activists and dog lovers are sceptical about the objectives of the project. ‘Citizen Initiative’ a collective of animal lovers did not mince their words. “Reports have been coming in from community carers that the sick and starved dogs released on October 27 have been met with horrible endings in various parts of the city. Citizens who visited the centre in the following days have seen that very sick and emaciated dogs that are unfit to undergo surgery are being sterilised or awaiting sterilisation. A lot of window dressing has been going on to make it appear that everything is fine there,” according to a statement issued by the Citizen Initiative. “Even the police have not filed an FIR till date although we raised complaints with the authorities regarding lapses in care being given to dogs being sterilised. Post-surgery, the dogs are not being treated well and it remains unknown actually how many dogs survive after the sterilisation,” said Sumitha Suseelan, animal rights activist. Sumitha Suseelan said that the matter has been brought to the notice of the city corporation, however, no concrete action has been done so far. Dogs are kept crammed in small cages with no space to stand up, move or lie down. They have to lie on top of each other or crouch. Base of the cage is made of metal rods which do not allow them to rest their paws firmly. They have to clutch the bars or their feet slip into the gaps. Spending even a few hours will permanently damage their paws, jeopardising their survival prospects on the streets after release, a statement issued by the Citizen Initiative reads. The animal lovers are not so optimistic about the corporation’s plan for establishing an advanced facility at a cost of Rs 4 crore at Thiruvallam. “There is absolutely nothing wrong with their infrastructure. It is with the exact same type of infrastructure that we have attained zero percent mortality while doing sterilisation. All ABC centres function with such facilities. These guys are just itching to start construction so as to steal a few more crores. Construction is always the easiest method to take money,” said Sumitha Suseelan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/corp-spent-rs-2-41cr-for-abc-project/articleshow/87544689.cms||Aswin J Kumar

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC elections to be held on schedule, says state panel||MUMBAI: Amid allegations of manipulation and mischief in the drawing of ward boundaries for BMC elections, State Election Commission (SEC) said draft ward boundaries would be published soon and suggestions and objections will be sought before the draft is approved. SEC said the elections will be as scheduled in early February 2022. State election commissioner U P S Madan said the draft would be put in public domain and around two weeks will be given for people to send suggestions and objections. “The draft submitted by BMC is not final. Suggestions and objections will be heard by a committee formed for this. The committee will make recommendations after hearing suggestions and objections and then final ward boundaries will be notified,” Madan told TOI. “So all people, including corporators and political parties, will be given a chance to raise objections and give suggestions. They will be given a hearing by the committee and all valid suggestions of objections will be examined on merit by the committee. The committee will make recommendations and SEC will then release the final draft. What BMC has submitted is only a first draft. Elections to BMC will be held as scheduled and there is no change to it,” Madan said. BJP last week filed a complaint with Election Commission of India (ECI) alleging manipulation in the draft ward boundaries that BMC submitted to the SEC. BJP has demanded a forensic audit of the draft sent to SEC and alleged that names of several voters were deleted, selectively, in BJP-dominated wards. BMC on October 26, submitted their final draft of rectified electoral ward boundaries of Mumbai’s 227 electoral wards to SEC. Officials from BMC’s election department said they had completed rectification of boundaries of the constituencies and around 20% of the boundaries across Mumbai have been changed. Officials said once ward boundaries are finalised, lottery for seat reservations will be held in late November or early December. In a letter to chief election commissioner (CEC) Sushil Chandra Madan, BJP MLA Ameet Satam and corporator Vinod Mishra said there should be a forensic investigation into BMC’s draft. “A forensic audit of computers, laptops and email IDs of officials from the BMC’s election and IT departments should be conducted. BMC officials must be asked to immediately freeze data which they submitted to BMC chief Iqbal Chahal. An investigation should be ordered into the role of the municipal commissioner in sharing demographic data with the chief minister,” BJP said in its letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-elections-to-be-held-on-schedule-says-state-panel/articleshow/87560857.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Fire at diaper factory; over 20 families evacuated, none hurt||JAIPUR: People from 20 houses were evacuated after a diaper production unit located at a residential area in Jaisinghpura Khor caught fire on Friday night. ACP (Amber) Saurabh Tiwari said the fire broke out around 9.30 pm on Friday and conflagration continued till Saturday morning as dark plumes of smoke billowed from the multi-storey building’s roof and windows. Tiwari said as the diaper factory was adjacent to a residential area, families had to be evacuated to prevent any untoward situation. "There was a risk of the entire building crashing down due to the increasing heat. Therefore, small holes were dug into its walls to pour water," he said. Sources in the district administration said they were not sure about the factory’s legalities and the fire No Objection Certificate (NOC) was yet to be determined. "The factory owner was not present at the spot. Only a watchman was present, but he fell ill due to the smoke and was admitted to hospital. Action will be taken against the factory if irregularities are found," an official said. The fire department pressed nearly 60 fire tenders to tackle the blaze. Officials said some water tankers atop a few houses were destroyed in flames. Police said the fire raged for over 13 hours and could be contained only around 9 am. "We had cut off power supply to the area. The LPG cylinders were also taken out because the smouldering pieces of shredded cotton were flying around everywhere which could have triggered another fire,’ the official said.Thick smoke enveloped the entire residential block where several residents spent a nervous night. As per officials, fire safety norms were found to be scarce. "Fire began sometime around 9.30 pm. Several houses have reported cracks due to the incident, many water tankers also got melted," said a resident, Om Prakash Soni. The estimated loss is yet to be ascertained. The city reported over 50 incidents of fire on Thursday and Friday. Fire officer Jagdish Fulwari said the fire department responded to nearly 40 calls in the city alone. Meanwhile, an auto showroom in Baldev Nagar in Barmer city was gutted after it caught fire on Saturday morning. Eight fire tenders tried to control the fire for around five hours, but by then everything had turned into ashes. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/fire-at-diaper-factory-over-20-families-evacuated-none-hurt/articleshow/87560846.cms||---

Excitement in the Bengali community was palpable at Kali Bari temples at Ghasiyari Mandi and Rabindra Palli. According to the custom, Kali Puja is performed on Diwali night and Annakoot celebrations are held the following day. Having a glance at the ‘chhappan bhog’ on the day of Annakoot provides the blessings of Maa Kali. Prasad distribution took place on Friday evening. Gautam Bhattacharya, president, management committee, Kali Bari Temple Trust, Ghasiyari Mandi, said that celebrations were held with traditional rituals. Pankaj Bose, president of Kali Bari Temple Trust, Ravindrapalli, said, “We allowed only 200 people on Kali Bari premises at a time for bhog. The temple got a footfall of about 1,500 to 2,000 people for Annakoot.” Mehuli Ghosh, a devotee, said, “I went to Kali Bari at Ghasiyari Mandi this year. The organisers were continuously insisting people to wear masks and use sanitizers while entering the premises. I could not attend the Annakoot Puja last year. It felt like a small get-together with all my relatives and loved ones around to seek blessings.” “The footfall was low this year in comparison to pre-Covid times, but still excitement was no less,” said Saurabh Banerjee, who visited the temple at Risaldar Park. Tuhina Srivastava, who has been visiting Model House park for Kali puja for 24 years, said “I along with my family visited the venue at midnight for Kali Puja.

---||Dehradun||Day after IFS Sanjiv Chaturvedi asked to probe illegal construction in Corbett, park admin starts demolishing unauthorised concrete structures||Dehradun: The Corbett administration on Saturday started demolishing ‘illegal’ concrete structures built in the park a day after the announcement that senior forest officer Sanjiv Chaturvedi will probe the matter. On Friday, head of forest force, Rajiv Bhartari, had said that Chaturvedi will submit his findings in a fortnight’s time. The demolition took place before Chaturvedi could give his formal consent to start the investigation and visit the site. The demolition included over a half dozen double-storey concrete buildings, each having four rooms with attached toilets along with other semi-built structures being built in the Pakhro zone of Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR), sources told TOI. Speaking about the demolition, director of CTR, Rahul (who goes by his first name only), said, “The action was initiated in accordance with the directions of the Uttarakhand high court, which has sought an 'action-taken' report on the matter by November 9.” He added that “prima facie, it seems no government funds were used in the construction of the structures” although he did not specify the source of funds. A retired forest official meanwhile said that it is likely that the funds may have been routed either through Corbett Foundation, a body under the forest department, or the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA). “It is important that the source of the funds for the illegal construction inside Corbett is probed thoroughly,” he said. The Uttarakhand high court had taken suo motu cognisance of a TOI report published on October 23, which highlighted the illegal construction taking place in CTR, which has the world’s highest tiger density. The report cited a visit by a team of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) which had confirmed presence of illegal structures in Corbett. The NTCA team had termed this as “an excellent example of administrative and managerial failure” and recommended a vigilance inquiry and action against erring forest officers. The high court, after taking note of the matter, had directed the forest department to form a three-member committee to inspect the site and submit a report “with regards to the nature and extent of the illegal construction being carried out, along with providing details of the people responsible for carrying out the same.” It had also ordered the department to spell out the steps being taken against such persons. Meanwhile, Gaurav Bansal, a Supreme Court advocate, on whose plea the site was inspected by the NTCA, tagged the demolition as an ‘incorrect move’. “The illegal construction was done by corrupt elements in the forest department and now the evidence is also being demolished. The actual cost of the construction in all the five-six zones of Corbett would easily exceed Rs 100 crore,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/day-after-ifs-sanjiv-chaturvedi-asked-to-probe-illegal-construction-in-corbett-park-admin-starts-demolishing-unauthorised-concrete-structures/articleshow/87559833.cms||Shivani Azad

In a press conference, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said the Kejriwal government would not tolerate wastage of taxpayers’ money and negligence in public safety. “The government has taken cognisance of this matter and ordered the director of local bodies to investigate it through PWD. The director is to submit a report within 15 days to recognise the lapses in parking construction so that appropriate action can be taken,” Sisodia said, adding that the corporation has collected huge money from the nearby shopkeepers in the name of parking conversion charges. “It is the result of BJP’s corruption that the parking could not last even for a year,” he alleged. “BJP has very few days left in the corporation, which they should spend cautiously,” the deputy CM said. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor claimed that AAP functionaries were running a vicious political campaign against the corporations before the civic polls. “SDMC has already clarified that there was a minor mechanical malfunctioning at Green Park Car parking, which was fixed in a few hours. There has been no corruption in Green Park car parking construction and the parking facility is fully functional after the incident. The inquiry is just a waste of administrative resources by Delhi government,” Kapoor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-orders-inquiry-into-parking-platform-collapse/articleshow/87560872.cms||---

Officials from both states inspected the dam recently and identified the trees that needed to be removed. In a letter to his Kerala counterpart Pinarayi Vijayan, Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin said, “On behalf of my government and the people of the southern districts of Tamil Nadu, I thank you and the government of Kerala for this permission (to cut and remove trees). This would go a long way in benefiting the people of both states and I sincerely hope that this spirit of cooperation between our states continues”. He reiterated TN’s commitment to undertake all steps needed to further strengthen Mullaperiyar dam and ensure safety of the people living downstream in Kerala. The previous AIADMK government even moved the Supreme Court in 2019 to remove 23 trees to take up strengthening work and the case is still pending. “Deputy director of Periyar Tiger Reserve, based on the approval of chief wildlife warden of Kerala, granted permission to Tamil Nadu PWD on Saturday to remove the trees. It has been proven that land where the dam is located is part of the leased area given to Tamil Nadu and not reserve forests of Kerala. This understanding follows a bilateral talk through video conference between the two sides in September. Now, the PWD will strengthen the concrete packing of Baby dam,” said an official. Following persistent efforts of TN government, Kerala restored power supply to the dam last February, after two decades of snapping of power lines citing electrocution of animals. TN is also pushing for repairing about 5km-long ghat approach road to the dam and raising a causeway. Kerala is yet to give its nod though. “The main dam is capable of holding the full reservoir level. Strengthening of Baby dam will pave the way for raising the permitted level,” said another official. In its 2014 judgment, the SC ordered carrying out dam strengthening work to restore the water level to 152ft, the full reservoir level. The work includes strengthening the Baby dam like instrumentation, earthen bund, protecting the earth mound (the upstream side of island between main dam and Baby dam), protecting the upstream side of the island between main dam and spillway, and raising the upstream parapet wall 160ft for the main dam along the remaining length of 20m. TN sanctioned Rs 7.8 crore for this purpose in 2015. Other work was completed, but strengthening of Baby dam and earthen bund remain incomplete.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/mullaperiyar-kerala-govt-gives-nod-to-remove-trees/articleshow/87560306.cms||Julie Mariappan
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Year on, governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari still sits on MVA’s list of 12 MLC names||MUMBAI: Exactly a year after the MVA government led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray submitted a list of 12 eminent persons from different walks of life for nominating on the legislative council to governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, the proposal is yet to see the light of the day for obvious political reasons. NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said it is shocking and surprising that despite the Bombay high court’s stringent observations, the file is gathering dust at Raj Bhavan. “We expect that Koshyari will honour the sentiment expressed by the high court. Merely on grounds that no time frame has been fixed in the Constitution, it was wrong for the governor to hold back the file. We expected that Koshyari would approve the proposal within a reasonable period. Unfortunately, it has not happened. We hope better sense will prevail,” Malik said. A delegation of cabinet members Anil Parab, Amit Deshmukh and Malik had submitted the list of 12 nominees from different fields of art, science, literature, cooperation and social work to the governor on November 7 last year. Among those, was Rajani Patil, who was recently elected to the Rajya Sabha. Due to the delay, when Thackeray, Ajit Pawar and Ashok Chavan called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, they had expressed displeasure over the inordinate delay over the nominations. “We expected that after our meeting with the Prime Minister, Koshyari would clear the proposal, but there was absolutely no movement,” said a senior cabinet member. The delay indicates that the MVA government is at loggerheads with Koshyari and no effort has been made to resolve it. Raj Bhavan was of the view that under the Constitution, no time frame has been fixed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-year-on-guv-still-sits-on-mvas-list-of-12-mlc-names/articleshow/87560900.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan bypoll effect: CM Ashok Gehlot may go for cabinet expansion instead of ministry rejig||JAIPUR: Armed with an impressive bypoll victory, chief minister Ashok Gehlot is scheduled to go to Delhi next week to discuss political appointments and cabinet expansion. The stock of Congress has increased after the party not only retained its seat in Vallabnagar, but captured a seat from the BJP in Dhariawad. The ruling party performed well in the panchayat elections also held recently in Dholpur and Alwar. These all would give Gehlot an advantage over Sachin Pilot in sharing power in the state. Now, doubts have been expressed over the early fulfilment of demands of the Pilot camp. The camp wants an equal share in the cabinet, political appointments and organisation. There has been a discussion in the All India Congress Committee regarding the demands of the Pilot camp. As Gehlot has become stronger politically, he may be in a position to influence the decisions related to the state. There is pressure from the MLAs of the Gehlot camp to become ministers and for positions in political appointments. Six former MLAs of BSP merged with the Congress, independent MLAs supporting the government and senior Congress MLAs from the Gehlot camp are contending for ministerial posts. After the byelections and panchayat polls, the confidence of the Gehlot camp has increased. The victory in the byelection has given lifeline to some ministers whose names were in circulation to be dropped from the cabinet. Now, in the changed circumstances, it might happen that the chief minister expands the council of ministers without dropping anyone, contrary to demands of the Pilot camp. If there is no interference from the high command, then Gehlot will go for a cabinet expansion and political appointments without dropping ministers, according to sources. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bypoll-effect-gehlot-may-go-for-cabinet-expansion-instead-of-ministry-rejig/articleshow/87560877.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot urges Centre to cut more excise duty on petrol & diesel||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has urged the Centre to reduce excise duty further on petrol and diesel in order to bring down inflation. “With the reduction of excise duty by the Centre, the VAT of the states is automatically reduced in the same proportion, yet, we demand that the Centre should reduce the excise duty more to reduce inflation,” tweeted the chief minister. Gehlot said the reduction of VAT on petrol by Rs 1.8 per litre and on diesel by Rs 2.6 per litre will lead to a loss of state revenue worth Rs 1,800 crore every year and bring down the prices of petrol and diesel by Rs 6.8 and Rs 12.6, respectively in the state. He said the state government in January this year had reduced the VAT by 2% which had cost the state exchequer Rs 1,000 crore. With the Centre’s move, the total cost to the state revenue is to the tune of Rs 2,800 crore. Gehlot, however, urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to reduce the excise duty further to provide relief to people reeling under inflation. He said the Rajasthan government is ready to bear the loss of revenue for the welfare of the people. He also asked the centre to restrain the oil companies from the daily hike in the prices of petrol / diesel. Otherwise, as before, after Diwali and the elections of five states, in a few days, the oil companies will increase the price and make the benefit of the relief given by the central and state government to zero.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-urges-centre-to-cut-more-excise-duty-on-petrol-diesel/articleshow/87560876.cms||---

According to police, Gokul, 30, an advocate from Thenur in Madurai district, was returning from Kodaikanal with his wife Nandhini Bharathi, 27, three-month-old daughter Yazhini, mother-in-law Alagurani, 46, and another relative, Kartikeyan, 26. The family had gone on a trip to Kodaikanal and was returning to Madurai via Theni. According to police, when the car was nearing Adukkam towards Theni around 8.45 pm, Gokul lost control of the vehicle due to low visibility. Police said the car veered off the road and fell about 300 feet into the gorge below. Three of the occupants who were seated at the back, including the baby, Nandhini and Alagurani, died on the spot. The advocate’s relative, Karthikeyan, who was seated in the front next to him, climbed up the hill and alerted the police over phone. Police and fire and rescue services department officials, including the deputy superintendent of police, Periyakulam, K Muthukumar, reached the spot to carry out rescue operation. After a few hours, with help from the general public close to the area, they were able to rescue Gokul alive and recover the bodies. While Karthikeyan suffered only minor injuries, Gokul is under treatment at Theni Government medical college hospital (MCH) for more severe injuries. Hospital dean Dr R Balajinathan told TOI that Gokul’s condition is stable. “There was no life-threatening injury. The patient has suffered a compression fracture in the lumbo sacral spine but there was no displacement. His abdominal CT scan is normal. We have him under the care of orthopaedicians and general surgeons,” he said. The three bodies were meanwhile sent for post mortem at the Theni MCH. A case has been registered by police under various sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC) for negligence and further investigation is on. Police sources said that negligence on the part of the driver and the ground on the edge of the road being unsteady due to the recent landslide and rainfall are suspected to be the possible reasons for the accident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/three-of-family-die-as-car-falls-into-300ft-gorge-in-kodaikanal/articleshow/87560327.cms||---

Compared to 2019, the firecrackers sale in the city on Diwali this year was almost double as per figures of the association of firecrackers traders. Traders said they did not anticipate customers would come in such numbers and had limited stock that was sold out on Diwali night itself. Jaipur police had issued nearly 900 temporary licences to sell firecrackers to various traders across the city and the city already had 200 firecrackers sellers having permanent licence. “It appears that the sale was almost double compared to 2019. On Choti and Badi Diwali, majority of the firecracker sellers had got all their stuff sold out. Also, it was seen that many despite having some stock of firecrackers at home came to purchase it,” said Mustafa Saeed who owns a firecrackers shop at Hawa Mahal market in the city. Zahir Ahamed, president of a firecrackers association, said, “A rise in the sale was witnessed. At some place it was a 50% rise while at many places the firecrackers sale was just double compared to what we had in 2019. Customers were happy to purchase firecrackers.” However, Jaipur police stated that with their strict vigilance and licensing norms no fire incident due to firecrackers was witnessed near and around the shops selling firecrackers. “We had constituted patrolling team that were visiting every shop to see if they had fire extinguishers and other resources to meet the emergency. Also, unlike every year we did not allow the firecracker sellers to sell firecrackers on the next day of Diwali,” said Haider Ali Zaidi, additional commissioner of police, law and order. Also, it was seen that police were little soft on the firecrackers sale especially they did not check if the firecrackers sellers were actually selling green firecrackers or not. Likewise, while lifting the ban the government had specifically asked the public not to burst firecrackers after 10 pm but it went on throughout the Diwali night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/firecrackers-biz-back-with-a-bang-after-silent-2020/articleshow/87560915.cms||---

The superfine particulate matter that started soaring after Diwali night (Thursday) led to a spike in the Air Quality Index (AQI) across most cities in the state. The AQI crossed the alarming 400-mark in about a dozen districts on Friday due to fireworks, vehicular emission and conducive weather conditions. A similar trend continued on Saturday. In Lucknow, the situation was comparatively better, but still the air was in poor (AQI: 201-300) category. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, the city’s AQI on Thursday was 242, which went up to 278 as air quality worsened on Friday before dropping to 260 on Saturday. Moderate winds kept air pollution level lower this year on Diwali as compared to 2019 and 2020, but the PM2.5 concentration in six localities of the city remained above permissible limits of 60 microgram set by the National Ambient Air Quality Standard. Average PM2.5 concentration was highest at Talkatora with 208 microgram per cubic air, followed by Dr Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University (172), Kukrail picnic spot (132.7), Lalbagh (128.6), Gomtinagar (109.8) and Central School, Aliganj (100).

People should adopt pollution control measures.” 11 UP cities among most polluted : The situation in central and west UP was worst with severe air quality (AQI above 400). In fact, Ghaziabad with AQI (466) and Noida (461) were the two most polluted places in the country followed by two cities of Haryana — Gurugram (456) and Faridabad (449). UP’s Baghpat (445), Hapur (445), Meerut (438) and Bulandshahr (433) also figured in the top 10. Overall, 11 UP cities (60%) were among the top 16 severely air-polluted places in India.

Gauda told police that he had taken a train from Ambernath that day, as he usually would, bringing goat food to sell in south Mumbai. He had wanted to travel till Sandhurst Road, but some co-passenger called him a drug addict and asked him to get down at Byculla instead.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Decades-long friendship through the lens||Thiruvananthapuram: ‘The Inmates’ a unique film which evolved out of decades-long friendship has now been honoured by the Universal Record Forum. The film became a reality due to the joint effort of 32 friends who met at the Mar Ivanios College in 1980. Sitting in 23 different countries the 1980-82 batch mates became actors and crew members to create this film during the pandemic period. The film has been recognised by the Universal Record Forum for its unique concept and creative method. The idea for ‘The Inmates’ came up during a Zoom meeting conducted by the former batch mates as most of them are living in different parts of the globe. As the idea came up during a Zoom meeting, all of them, though now in their late 50s, thought of experimenting on a film by filming themselves. “It was during a get together of our batch through the Zoom meeting that I discussed the idea of creating a film. Everyone readily agreed and most of them bought new cameras for the filming process. The shooting was carried out in 23 countries where the ‘actors’ are currently settled. The film mainly includes single shots,” said Baiju Thomas, the director of the movie, and one of the 32 friends. “We faced a few challenges, including reshooting certain scenes until they became satisfactory. Another issue we faced was about the footage, some of them were shot in horizontal and while others were in vertical format. Hence it became difficult while editing those 90 hours footage into a movie of 1 hour 55 minutes,” said Baijiu Thomas. The actors themselves were the technicians and did makeup and other art works with the help of their family members. This was the main reason behind the Universal Record Forum’s recognition, he added. The film was released on an OTT platform on October 1. It took four months to finish the shooting. “I am so happy being a part of this,’’ said Sreejith Srinivas, the chief associative director.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/decades-long-friendship-through-the-lens/articleshow/87544740.cms||---
---||Delhi||Can all Delhi govt schools run in single shift? DoE hopes so||NEW DELHI: Taking note of the increase in the enrolment of students in Delhi government schools and the completion of construction of additional school infrastructure, the directorate of education has written to all district education officers to explore the possibility of converting all double-shift schools to single-shift ones. Currently, several schools are run in two shifts, mornings normally for girls and the evenings for boys. Of the 1030 government schools in Delhi, 429 are girls’ schools, 407 boys’ and 194 co-educational. If all the institutions now opt only to have a single shift, most will become co-ed schools. A DoE circular sent to the deputy district education (DDE) officers on Friday said, “Keeping in view the increase of enrolment in government schools, all deputy director of education (district) are directed to explore the possibility to convert double shift school to a single shift and also make school-wise plans to shift the students in coordination with the school management committees and parents so that quality of education may be improved. As the construction of additional rooms is nearing completion, the plan to convert the schools from double shift to single shift may be explored.” According to the data available, students attending the morning shift and single-shift schools have performed better in the CBSE classes X and XII board exams than the evening shift. In 2021, the evening shift had a pass percentage of 99.88% in the Class XII board results against 99.96% and 99.98% for general and morning-shift schools. The importance of running single-shift schools in Delhi has been periodically highlighted. Almost a decade ago, the committee set up by the National Council for Educational Research and Training for the ‘Development of a Policy Framework for Implementation of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009’ in Delhi had strongly recommended ending the double-shift schooling practice. The measure is also inspired by examples from other countries, such as Ghana, which implemented a policy to convert all double-shift schools to single-shift ones. A paper published by the University of Oslo determined that the reason behind the Ghana policy decision was to ensure effective and efficient teaching and learning by lengthening the instructional time. Even in 2019, DoE had drawn up a plan to convert 92 schools into a single-shift system following the construction of new school buildings. The addition of space had resulted in the students per classroom ratio falling to less than 40.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/can-all-govt-schools-run-in-single-shift-doe-hopes-so/articleshow/87560920.cms||Shradha Chettri

The societies organized RT-PCR camps during the lockdown period and now are holding vaccination camps to ensure that members and other staff get vaccinated and remain protected from Covid-19. As the pandemic ebbed, Rustomjee Seasons organized a vaccination drive within the complex. “A Covid vaccination camp was held at the complex for all the members who had not taken the vaccine. Our 120 staff members too were vaccinated and the housing society paid for their vaccination. In all, 430 people were vaccinated,” said Rustomjee Seasons’ secretary Jimmy Haallis Francis. He added that queries regarding vaccination were answered by qualified doctors who also encouraged members through the Public Address System to get vaccinated. There are 120 members in 360 flats in the society. During the pandemic, a quarantine centre was created at the complex replete with a hospital bed, oxygen concentrators and in-house group of doctors. A team of women residents provided home-cooked meals to patients in need. Thane-based Fairfield CHS is located in the centre of the Lodha Luxuria Complex which also has two more societies—West Gate CHS and Clare Mont CHS. Fairfield CHS has 276 flats and 886 members. A team of three administrators— V C Gupte, S D Sawant and Surendra Thakur—took extensive measures during the Covid-19 pandemic to keep fellow residents safe and protected. “We held a two-day camp to conduct RT-PCR tests for the members, staff, housekeeping staff, security staff, maids and drivers amidst the pandemic. More than 200 persons benefited from these camps,” said Gupte. He added that senior citizens residing at the society were given extra care and help reached them immediately whenever these elders needed it. During the lockdown, vegetable vendors, grocery shops, snacks and sweetmeat shops at the society premises were arranged. A mobile ATM service for the residents was arranged. Apart from completing the stalled works at the gymnasium, the society also created a meeting room for online meetings and undertook the digitization of members’ records. Their data has now been stored on a cloud computing platform. Gupte added that the first charging station for electric vehicles has also been installed at the complex.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/injecting-hope-two-hsg-socs-hold-free-vax-rt-pcr-camps-for-staff/articleshow/87560924.cms||---

According to sources in the police, the suspect Dr Danish George was held from Ooty in Tamil Nadu. His arrest will be soon recorded after he is brought to Chirayinkeezhu police station. The alleged crime in connection with the case had taken place last Sunday. The police registered a case the next day after the victim Mithun Krishna's mother approached them with a complaint on Monday. Mithun Krishna was hospitalised after the attack as he sustained injuries on his head. On the same day of registering the case, a team of police set out to Kochi in search of Danish George as he worked there. But they could not find him. His mobile phone location was traced and it was found to be in Mettupalayam in neighbouring Tamil Nadu then. Since they were not prepared for a longer journey, the team returned to Chirayinkeezhu. On Wednesday, the case received much public attention after the complainants contacted the media. Immediately following this, the Attingal DSP constituted a special team headed by Chirayinkeezhu sub inspector Vineesh and sent them to Tamil Nadu in search of the suspect. Danish George's sister Deepthi had allegedly eloped with Mithun Krishna, who works as a data entry staff at an Akshaya Centre at Kadakkavoor during the early hours of October 29. On the same day, they appeared before the Chirayinkeezhu police and Deepthi informed them that she wanted to go with Mithun Krishna. Her father and brother too were present at the station then. They got married later. Later, her father and brother invited them to their church to talk about the marriage. There, they allegedly demanded Mithun to convert. He promptly rejected this demand. On their return journey they were taken to Deepthi's home. But a squabble brokeout between Deepthi's family members and Mithun Krishna's friends. It was during this argument the alleged casteist slurs were used against Mithun and he was beaten up by Deepthi’s brother Danish George.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/man-held-for-attacking-dalit-brother-in-law/articleshow/87544745.cms||---

A large number of vehicles had been stuck on both sides of the slide amid inclement weather conditions. The task to clear the debris under unfavourable weather was risky, but Karthik, who was a dozer operator, cleared the debris and resumed traffic movement. In a statement, 38 Border Road Task Force commander Col Uma Shankar said, “He (Karthik) undertook the herculean task of clearing the debris to open the road axis and rescue stranded civilians. While carrying out the task, he got down from the dozer to inspect the quantity of remaining debris on the road.

At Scottish Church College the portal will reopen on November 8. “Those who applied earlier have to apply again,” said an official. Lady Brabourne College will be publishing its admission schedule on the website shortly. While most colleges have filled up substantial number of seats there are many where a large chunk of seats are still vacant.

The CM has further directed officials to carry out a survey of the impacted areas to ensure a correct assessment of loss so that farmers can be compensated at the earliest. “The government had already released two instalments, including Rs 160 crore to about 4,77,581 farmers and Rs. 48.21 crore to 1,39,863 farmers identified in a survey in the last week of October. Torrential rains and heavy floods in September and October resulted in massive damage to crops this year. The compensation that has been released by the government will be transferred to farmers directly into their bank accounts,” said a government spokesperson. The compensation is being paid out from the State Disaster Relief Fund.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rs-282cr-aid-to-over-8l-flood-hit/articleshow/87560934.cms||---

The work to be carried out by the Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry (TNCCI) at Rs 20 lakh was initiated in the presence of Madurai MP Su Venkatesan and senior railway officials. Chamber president N Jegatheesan said that the 15ft-tall statue weighing between 2.5 to 3 tonnes with three fish jumping on top of each other was installed by the chamber at the eastern entrance of the junction in 1999. It was to perpetuate the memory of the emblem of the glorious Pandian era. About two-and-a-half-years ago it was removed when the railways took up infrastructure and beautification work to facilitate smooth entry of buses and other vehicles to the main entrance of the junction. The statue was removed on the assurance by the then divisional railway manager (DRM) that an alternative place would be provided to reinstall it. The statue was kept in a room on the railway premises. DRM P Ananth provided space in front of the 100ft-tall national flag post at the eastern entrance for re-installation of the statue. The statue will be installed amidst a colourful fountain that is 14ft wide and 60ft long. “We expect the work to be completed in a month’s time and dedicate it to the public,” Jegatheesan added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/re-installation-work-of-bronze-fish-statue-begins-at-madurai-jn/articleshow/87560337.cms||---

The movement submitted a petition to minister for social welfare and women empowerment P Geetha Jeevan. Founder and chief volunteer of the movement P Sankar said they put forward eight demands to the minister, considering the rising population of senior citizens in the state. “According to the census, there were 75 lakh senior citizens in Tamil Nadu in the year 2011. It is expected to double to 1.5 crore in the year 2030,” he said. Among the key demands are establishing day care centres across the state at least at the district-level and increasing the monthly old age pension to Rs 2,000 and ensuring that it reached them at their doorstep without facing hardships and dependence on others in receiving it. The movement also sought constituting a committee by the government to come out with standards for old age homes, establishing old age homes not only in cities but also in the rural areas, motivating philanthropists and non-government organisations engaged in elderly care by recognising them at the state-level with awards and cash rewards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/state-govt-urged-to-set-up-senior-citizens-welfare-board/articleshow/87560338.cms||---

There is 2,053 sanctioned strength of teachers in 66 (including 16 colleges started this year) government colleges. Out of these there are 906 assistant professors in these colleges and many of them are working for over one and half decades on monthly wages of nearly Rs 24,000 per month. Apart from them, there are 224 part time assistant professors who are getting Rs 21,600 as basic pay and dearness allowance (DA), totalling nearly Rs 53,500 per month. in addition, 325 lecturers are working on regular posts, while nearly 600 posts are vacant. Those on regular posts are getting salaries of over Rs 1 lakh per month. With the faculty members on the protest, the studies of thousands of students is getting derailed. “The state government last month had advertised 1,091 posts for which the last day to apply is November 8. Many of the assistant professors working on temporary basis for years have already surpassed the entry point age for government service and will not be eligible for recruitment. The government should give preference to regularise the services of 906 temporary basis assistant professors, who already have immense experience of teaching, and give us the now fixed and consolidated basic pay of Rs 56,100 per month,” said guest faculty association state president Ravinder Singh. Out of Rs 24,000 the guest faculty members get, Rs 12,400 is paid by state government as grant in aid and Rs 11,600 is contributed from parent teacher association (PTA) funds, and at many of the colleges the students have to pay for this PTA fund, which is burden on them, the association pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/over-900-guest-faculty-members-in-govt-colleges-protest/articleshow/87560346.cms||---

Once the land is demarcated, sanads (land titles) will be issued to the beneficiaries. The state directorate of settlement and land records (DSLR) issued the work order to Theovel Surveys, a Bengaluru-based firm that bagged the tender for survey, demarcation, preparation of plans and fixing of boundary stones for claims received under the Forest Rights Act. An agreement has been inked between DSLR, the directorate of tribal welfare and Theovel Surveys. Sources at the directorate of tribal welfare said that the agency has begun the spot verification exercise of the 270–odd cases and is likely to complete the task within the next two months. Minister for tribal welfare Govind Gaude had said that the government had to outsource the task due to inadequate number of surveyors with DSLR who could be deployed for the FRA cases. “The team of surveyors of directorate of settlement and land records would be able to complete just 2-3 cases of spot verification in a day, and this would result in delay of disposal of the claims,” Gaude had told reporters recently. So far, of the 10,136 claims received by the government under the FRA, only 46 sanads have been issued to the beneficiaries. The agency has been asked to complete the spot verification of all these cases within a year once they are cleared by the district level committee. As per the provisions of the FRA, when a forest dweller files a claim for the land title, it passes through three levels of checks — the gram sabha, the sub divisional level committee and the district level committee. A person acquires the land title (sanad) only when it is approved by the district level committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/spot-verification-of-forest-rights-claims-begins/articleshow/87560401.cms||---

Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana issued directions in this regard. The move came after SHO Palam village, Paras Nath Verma, deposited an amount of Rs 96,340 as a fixed deposit (FD) in a bank. The amount was seized in a gambling raid earlier in 2019. On October 15, TOI had reported that the South-West district, under which Palam police station falls, would soon implement the scheme all across the district. Later on, it was decided to implement the scheme all throughout the 210 police stations in the city. However, in a meeting last week, directions were issued that instead of the FD system every police station will open a savings bank account and deposit the seized cash in it. Traditionally, the seized cash or recovered notes were stored in the makhana, also referred to as a storeroom at a police station. The opening of the accounts will save the trouble of notes being damaged or stolen. A police officer told TOI the process has begun in some police stations who have even opened the accounts already.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-to-keep-seized-cash-in-savings-a/cs/articleshow/87560967.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Thiruvallom the lone zonal office to publish tax data||Thiruvananthapuram: With the 30 day timeline declared by Mayor Arya Rajendran to complete tax updation process ending on Friday, four wards under Thiruvallom zonal office will be the first to publish the updated tax data. Save for wards under Thiruvallom zonal office, updation process could not be completed in all the remaining wards. The officials hope that around 50 wards would be able to get updated data of property tax published at least by next week. Following the fund fraud in zonal offices, the mayor had told the council meeting in October that all data related to property tax would be verified, updated and published within 30 days. Even then officials who had dealt with the glitches in software and inaccurate data had remained sceptical about the mayor’s optimistic declaration. For the three bill collectors Rajiv, Roshni, Ashmi, revenue inspector Girija Kumari and charge officer Sukila Jiji, it has been a herculean task for the past one month to get the receipts verified and posted online. The officials associated with Thiruvallom zonal office said that they had an early advantage of posting data on a daily basis. “We began with migrating all data in the old software since 1998 to the new one. Then physical verification of receipts was done to iron out inaccuracies and mismatches. Over 10,000 receipts were verified and posted in the last one month. We went over receipt books manually and entries from old software were reposted in the new one,” said one of the revenue officials associated with Thiruvallom zonal office. Inspite of their hard work, they would still have to deal with shortcomings of IKM software, an issue corporation has been repeatedly raising before the state government but without any concrete intervention to get it resolved. One advantage of publishing all the updated data on property tax is that corporations will now have a fairly good idea of actual defaulters in each ward. Since the tax for the first half of the fiscal year is recorded by the ninth month, those who have not paid tax for 2021-22 in the first half will also find themselves in the defaulters’ list. Absence of bill collectors in around 28 wards has also slowed down the process. Two years ago, the corporation had undertaken a similar data cleaning exercise by roping in temporary data entry operators, however even that data updation process had not produced the desired results. BJP leader M R Gopan had told the council that although his tax dues were cleared till 2020-21, the system still reflected his dues. When the matter was brought to the attention of the ruling council, it was updated and posted on the system. While four wards under Thiruvallom zone managed to bring out an updated list, it won’t be easy for other offices due to issues in software and absolute lack of clear data to work with. The officials admit that migration to new software from 2016-17 has been ridden with problems since the old data never got transferred fully and in a flawless manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/thiruvallom-the-lone-zonal-office-to-publish-tax-data/articleshow/87560361.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Delhi||Delhi govt to give ration for free for 6 more months||NEW DELHI: Delhi government has extended its free ration scheme for next six months in the wake of the negative impact of the Covid pandemic on people, especially the poor. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has written a letter to PM Narendra Modi appealing that the Centre should also extend its free ration scheme considering the pandemic and the rising inflation in the country. The central government has announced that it currently has no proposal to continue free ration distribution under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana after November 30. “Delhi government is extending its free ration scheme to the poor for six months. I urge the central government to also extend its ration scheme for six months by writing a letter to the Prime Minister. People are in a lot of trouble right now. It would not be right to leave their hand at this juncture,” Kejriwal stated in a tweet in which he shared the letter to the PM. In another tweet, the CM said, “Inflation has become too high. The common man is finding it difficult to even get two square meals. Many are unemployed due to Covid. Mr Prime Minister, please extend this scheme of giving free ration to the poor for six more months. Delhi government is extending its free ration scheme for six months.” Underlining the need to extend the free ration scheme, Kejriwal stated in the letter that “during the Covid period, the central government had given free ration to every ration card holder across the country in addition to the ration that was being made available every month. Delhi government made the monthly ration supply free from its own end.” The CM said: “Due to these steps of the central government and Delhi government, the poor got a lot of relief during the pandemic. These schemes of both the governments are ending in November. The central government has announced that this scheme will not be extended after November.” Kejriwal further wrote in the letter that “many people lost their jobs during the Corona period. They have no means of earning...Delhi government is extending the scheme from its own end to provide people free additional ration for six months. It will be very kind of you to do the same as well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-to-give-ration-for-free-for-6-more-mths/articleshow/87560365.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Party to take call whether I would contest, says Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: A week after announcing that he would not contest the forthcoming assembly elections, Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday said his party would take a call on him contesting the polls.  In what is being seen as a hint that he may eventually jump into the fray, Akhilesh said he would not elaborate on the issue any further, else the media would start asking him about his constituency. Asked to clarify his position in the light of CM Yogi Aditaynath’s statement that the party will take a call on his contesting elections, the former UP CM said the party would take a call on the issue. “… aur jab chunav maidan mein hain, to chunav se peeche kaise hatenge humlog (When we are in the fray, how can we step back from elections) he said adding: “… kyon ki jaisi hi han kahenge … to kshetra puchoge … (the moment I will say Yes, you will ask me about the constituency …)”. He said he would elaborate on the issue when the time comes. Akhilesh, who is an MP from Azmagarh, has never contested any assembly election so far and had announced last week that he would not contest this time as well. Akhilesh dismissed media queries on the possibilities of Congress being a partner in the SP’s alliance with the Rashtriya Lok Dal. On the issue of the recent ‘meeting’ between Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi and RLD chief Jayant Chaudhary at Lucknow airport waiting lounge, the former UP CM described it as something like “two people bumping into each other at a restaurant”. Asked to explain the context of his statement in which he spoke about Sardar Patel, Mahatma Gandhi and Mohammed Ali Jinnah in the same breath and BJP attacking him for comparing Sardar Patel and Jinnah, Akhilesh said there was no point in explaining the context. “Dobara kitabein padh lein (They should read history again),” he said. The SP president made these statements while talking to the media after inaugurating the regional office of Janvadi Party Socialist led by Sanjay Singh Chauhan in Lucknow. He attacked the ruling BJP for malpractices in the previous Lok Sabha polls. He said BJP supporters “gave money to buy votes” and voters in large numbers were inked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/party-to-take-call-whether-i-would-contest-akhilesh/articleshow/87560973.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

---||Lucknow||Jinnah remark: UP CM Yogi Adityanath launches veiled attack on Akhilesh Yadav’s values & education||LUCKNOW: Unleashing a veiled attack on Samajwadi party president Akhilesh Yadav for equating nationalist icons Sardar Patel, Gandhi and Nehru with Pakistan founder Jinnah, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday said those with inadequate education and improper values can’t differentiate between a nationalist and a traitor. “Yadi shiksha adhoori hai, sanskaar-hin hai, shishtachaar-vihin hai to aap ye umeed nahi kar sakte ki wo vyakti rashtra nayak aur rashtra drohi ke beech antar mehsoos kar paayega (You can’t expect a person with incomplete education, poor values and lacking in etiquette to decipher between a national hero and a traitor),” Adityanath said during the launch of Rs 1,980cr direct-benefit transfer (DBT) scheme for purchase of uniforms, shoes, socks, sweaters and school bag for 1.6 crore children enrolled in state-run and aided schools from classes 1 to 8. Without naming SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav, the chief minister escalated his attack, saying “Aaj agar kabhi kabhi is prakar ki sthithi paida hoti hai uska karan prarambik samay me abhibhawak ke dwara shiksha ke prati wah roochi naa lene ka karan ho sakta hai. (The reason for such an intellectual crisis is a parent’s lack of interest on a child’s education).” “The deviation begins when a person doesn’t know the difference between nationalists and traitors and weighs both on the same scale. Such attitudes raise questions on their abilities. So, I wish our schools sets the narrative right from morning assemblies,” the chief minister said. The CM emphasised the need to inculcate etiquette and cleanliness in students. “Teachers and principals should ensure every child comes to school in uniform and never in bare foot. Children should be taught on ways to sit in a classroom and if they don’t imbibe etiquette now, they will never learn,” the CM said during the programme held at his official residence. Under the direct benefit scheme, parents will be able to buy quality school uniforms, shoes, socks, sweaters and bags with every student receiving Rs 1,100. The move will wipe out corruption in procurement of school uniforms, shoes, socks, sweaters and bags, he said. The CM said it was a matter of joy that in three years, enrolment in basic schools had risen by 50lakh from 1.3crore in 2017 to 1.8crore in 2020. “Schools now have a different look,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/jinnah-remark-yogi-launches-veiled-attack-on-akhileshs-values-education/articleshow/87560975.cms||---
---||Patna||BSF officer, soldier among 4 new hooch victims in Bihar||PATNA: Close on the heels of 37 deaths in the twin hooch tragedies in Gopalganj and West Champaran this week, four more persons died on Friday night after consuming spurious liquor in Samastipur district. The authorities, however, came to know about it on Saturday morning. The death toll in Gopalganj mounted to 21 while 16 died in West Champaran since Wednesday last, increasing the total toll to 41, including 4 in Samastipur, so far. Samastipur SP Manavjit Singh Dhillon told TOI over phone on Saturday that the four died after consuming poisonous hooch. “There is no other obvious reason behind the deaths and illness. Police have recovered a few small IMFL bottles from which liquor was consumed,” he said. The SP said it seems spurious IMLF was manufactured and packed in liquor bottles for smuggling. “The label on the bottles seems fake as wrong spelling of ‘Bengaluru’ was printed on them,” he said. The deceased in Samastipur included BSF sub-inspector Vinay Kumar Singh (55) posted in Jammu and Army jawan Jagannath Rai (28) posted in Delhi. The two others were identified as Shyam Nandan Choudhary (52) and Veerchandra Rai (27). While Vinay and Veerchandra hailed from Rupauli Chaksima village, Jagannath was from Bhagwanpur Chaksima and Shyamnandan belonged to Sangrampur, all in Rupauli panchayat under Patori police station area. Unlike previous incidents, they consumed Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) and not the country liquor. Yaduvansh Rai and Deepak Singh from Rupauli Chaksima were undergoing treatment at Samastipur Sadar hospital and AIIMS-Patna, respectively. Jagannath was rushed to the military hospital at Danapur in Patna on Friday night, but died.  Altogether 54 hooch deaths have been reported in Bihar in less than a month and overall 107 persons have reportedly died in 16 separate hooch incidents since January this year. Patori police station SHO Mukesh Kumar said the Army jawan had reached the village on October 22 to attend the last rites of his aunt. “The BSF SI had reached home on November 2 on Diwali vacation,” he said. He said a police team had spotted a crowd at Patori sub-divisional hospital on Friday night. “Vijay was brought died. Family members cited illness as the reason behind death. Police asked them to get postmortem done, but they refused,” he said. The SHO said when more deaths came to light by Saturday morning, investigation cleared that Vinay had also consumed liquor. The Samastipur SP said postmortem examination could be conducted on three bodies only as the family members of Veerchandra had already cremated him late Friday night. “The family members of the deceased tried to cover up the deaths and cited food poisoning and other reasons. Later, it became clear that they all had consumed liquor, Dhillon said. “They had consumed liquor on November 3 and 4 night after purchasing the bottles from a general store and milk booth owner in Rupauli,” he said. Both are evading arrest. “Door-to-door medical survey is being carried out in the entire panchayat so that any ill person can be provided treatment,” the SP said.

---||Delhi||Pollution may impact brain growth in healthy kids: Doctors||NEW DELHI: The polluted air is not only a risk to people with respiratory diseases. A paediatrician has cautioned that children with no history of such conditions were prone to be adversely affected by the bad air. Dr Dhiren Gupta of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital’s paediatrics department said on Saturday that air pollution — at the ‘severe’ level since Diwali — is affecting the city’s children. “Yes, pollution is affecting kids who are predisposed to asthmatic attacks, but we are also seeing children who are absolutely normal facing respiratory problems,” Gupta said. “They are also suffering from irritation in the eyes. Pollution also causes clouding of the brain. Babies and children become irritable because of the pollution.” The paediatrician said that three children had been admitted to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital with severe asthma. “In past 10-15 days, we have seen a sudden rise in the exaggeration of symptoms in those who are asthmatic and allergic,” Gupta said. Dr Ambuj Roy, professor of cardiology at AIIMS, reiterated that the problem of air pollution was a much bigger threat today than Covid-19. “Elderly people, patients with lung and heart problems, those who have recovered from Covid and pregnant women are susceptible to problems when the air quality is so poor,” Roy said. The medical experts are emphatic that everyone suffers from air pollution. People are complaining of headaches and difficulties in breathing. “Young children are very vulnerable & this pollution can affect their brain development. Hospital is full of patients. So this is a difficult phase for us. Every year, we face this problem but failed to address or correct it,” tweeted Dr Naresh Trehan, chairman and managing director, Medanta, Gurgaon. Forecasting agencies said the air quality was unlikely to improve till Sunday evening. On Saturday, SAFAR’s PM 2.5 reading was 436 micrograms per cubic metre against the safe level of 60.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/docs-pollution-may-impact-brain-growth-in-healthy-kids/articleshow/87560978.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Police record arrest of Danish George||Thiruvananthapuram: The Chirayinkeezhu police on Saturday recorded the arrest of Dr Danish George, 28, in connection with the case related to attack on a Dalit man who married his sister. The doctor, who was absconding after committing the alleged crime, was caught from a resort at Ooty in Tamil Nadu, on Friday by a team of police from Attingal police subdivision. Following the arrest, the police also took him to the crime scene, which is the road in front of his residence at Anathalavattom, for the procedure of collecting evidence. During the procedure, Danish George told the police that he attacked the complainant, Midhun Krishna, out of sudden provocation after the latter's friend verbally abused and disrespected his mother. When the couple were brought to the house, the mother refused to let them in and spoke to Midhun Krishna in an angry manner. This led to a verbal spat between her and Midhun's friend who was accompanying them. This quarrel snowballed into a fist fight in which Midhun sustained serious injuries on head after he fell and smashed his it against the hard surface of a parapet wall. The incident took place on October 31. The police had initially registered the case invoking relevant sections under the SC and ST Prevention of Atrocities Act along with sections of causing hurt under the IPC. Now, they have added a new section of attempt to commit culpable homicide after the doctor who is treating Midhun Krishna informed the police that the injuries he sustained were serious in nature. Midhin Krishna and Danish George's sister Deepthi had eloped and got married on October 29. The fracas related to the case happened when the accused and his father took the couple to their house to talk about holding a marriage ceremony. Danish was produced before the court and remanded in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/police-record-arrest-of-danish-george/articleshow/87560371.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Tracing the origin of Malayalam||Thiruvananthapuram: The State Central Library, one of the oldest libraries in the country is hosting an exhibition on the rare Malayalam scripts, some of them dating back to 1510. The authorities got the idea for this unique exhibition after deputy state librarian Asokan P U composed these rare collections and put together what he unearthed on a chart paper. The exhibition aims at providing information to the present generation about the evolution of Malayalam language and also to gather those scripts at one place. The exhibition includes three forms of old Malayalam script written in 44 sheets of papers which include “kolezhuthu”, “vettezhuthu” and “malayanma”. “So many words disappear when a language undergoes evolution. The old scripts were sourced from the library itself. We were not able to showcase all the evolutionary processes, but we have showcased important developments,” an official said. Vettezhuthu is the most ancient script in Malayalam which was believed to be used till the time of Thunchath Ezhuthachan. It evolved from the Tamil language as during ancient times, the language used in Kerala was Tamil and vattezhuthu script was very much in use. It is named after its characteristic, that is, the usage of broken symbols while writing. It is also known as vattezhuthu. “The drawbacks of vattezhuthu script paved the way for kolezhuthu. Kolezhuthu can be seen in O Chandu Menon’s novel ‘Indulekha’ which was published in 1889. During the period of kolezhuthu, most of the symbols we use in modern Malayalam language did not exist. Malayanma came after the kolezhuthu script which was used to write the Malayalam language. It is a mixture of vattezhuthu and kolezhuthu,” the official said. During the period of kolezhuthu, when the royal palace and the Padmanabhaswamy temple authorities wrote a letter, it will only start with the words “kovilo” and “kovilakamo.” “We cannot exactly say that these are Kerala scripts because the historians and linguists have proven that the country has a common concept in the language system. Most of the alphabets in different Indian languages sound the same. The Indian language follows the style of “swara” and “vyenchana” alphabets in most of its languages. The Indian languages were derived from such common scripts. We are planning to start a historiography of Malayalam language in the Malayalam department,” said Asokan P U, deputy state librarian. The seven days exhibition was inaugurated by the veteran film maker Adoor Gopalakrishnan on November 1. It will conclude on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/tracing-the-origin-of-malayalam/articleshow/87560379.cms||---
---||Delhi||141 booked for bursting crackers in Noida||Noida: As many as 141 people were arrested and 114 cases were lodged in Noida for cracker ban violations on Diwali night. In both Noida and Ghaziabad, there was a complete ban on the sale and use of firecrackers. Police said they relied on local inputs and complaints lodged on Dial 112 to make the arrests. But they agreed that surveillance was difficult — in many cases, the bursting of crackers had stopped by the time the cops reached. The result of the widespread cracker ban flout, combined with instances of stubble burning and meteorological factors was evident in the quality of air on Diwali evening and the day after. On both days, AQI was in the “severe” category. In Noida city, the most number of arrests was made in Sector 24 police station area. A total of nine cases were lodged there and 14 persons were arrested. It was followed by Sector 39, where seven cases were lodged. Sector 58 had six cases registered. In the central Noida zone, a total of 48 cases were lodged and 55 people arrested. In Greater Noida zone, a total of 36 cases were lodged and 47 people arrested. At 8, Jewar police station area had the most number of cases followed by six each in Jarcha and Rabupura, five in Dadri and four in Kasna. There were three cases of cracker ban violation each in Ecotech I and Dankaur areas. Anita Chauhan, the SHO of Bisrakh police station, said most of the cases were lodged after inputs from local cops who were patrolling. A police officer agreed it was difficult to trace the flood of complaints lodged on Dial 112. “If people complained about a particular spot, the bursting of crackers would stop by the time police reached. That is why it is difficult to attend to such calls,” the officer said. Gzb most polluted city in country: Ghaziabad on Saturday became the country's most polluted city for the fifth time this season. The city recorded an AQI of 466 even as the overall air quality showed a slight improvement from Friday when the district recorded an AQI of 470. Ghaziabad’s AQI has been in the 'severe’ category since Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/141-booked-for-bursting-crackers-in-noida/articleshow/87561001.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Schools look at open-air classes to keep kids, teachers safe in Covid times||KOLKATA: Move over air-conditioned classrooms, open-air classrooms are now in consideration. As schools get ready to call their students back to the campus from November 16, a number of institutes in the city are thinking about holding a few classes in the open, considered safer than a closed environment in Covid times. Schools re-opening after such a long gap will need several alterations to conventional teaching methods to get children to re-connect with their teachers, many of whom they had only seen on the screen for the past 20 months. Schools, like La Martiniere for Girls, St James’, The Heritage School, BDMI and Sushila Birla Girls’ High School, have already planned outdoor sessions through the winter months. Heads of these schools said among the many lessons Covid had taught, the one about the need for being in the open as much as possible was important. They want their students to punctuate indoor classroom time with outdoor sunning. “We just cannot start off classes in the formal and rigid mode and expect children to adapt automatically after so many months of online learning. We need to have re-connection time and I am working out the routine in such a way that teachers can take them out to the field, make them sit in a spaced circle and not only teach but also chat and melt the ice,” said Rupkatha Sarkar, principal at La Martiniere for Girls. School heads said some theory classes, like history, English and second language, which might not need the board immediately, could be taken outside the conventional classroom space. “Children have to enjoy coming back to school and being outside with the teacher would definitely help them bond better. This will automatically promote health, too,” said Heritage School principal Seema Sapru. In some schools, such as BDMI, chairs have been laid out in selected outdoor spots for both students and teachers. These are breezy zones, where children can sit and follow theory lectures, says principal Vijaya Chowdhury. At St James’ School, holding classes in the field had been quite a favourite activity for some teachers and students loved those sessions. “When we bring back our IX and XI in January, we will have more of these. The X and XII will come directly for their exams and so, they will not be free before January. But we are looking at a lot of outdoor classes when we re-start,” said principal T H Ireland. Even hybrid class would not be a problem, schools said. Computers can be placed in such a way that teachers can show children on the screen, a slice of their school campus while taking the class. Sushila Birla Girls’ School will use whatever open space is there for outdoor sessions, said principal Koeli Dey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/schools-look-at-open-air-classes-to-keep-kids-teachers-safe-in-cov-times/articleshow/87559968.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Delhi||Ration: BJP says people being misled||New Delhi: Leader of opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri and BJP MLA Vijender Gupta on Saturday claimed that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal was trying to mislead people on free ration for the poor. The remarks came after Kejriwal stated in a tweet that the Delhi government has extended the free ration scheme for six months and the Centre should also do the same. The BJP leaders said that the free ration that the chief minister is promising is actually being provided to 72 lakh poor in Delhi by the Centre under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana since April last year, in addition to the ration available under the National Food Security Act by the Modi government. “The Centre, at a cost of Rs 1,000 crore annually, procures wheat at a market price of Rs 25 per kg and rice at Rs 30 per kg. The CM is touting this as Delhi government’s free ration scheme and making a mockery of the poor,” Gupta said in a statement. “On the other hand, despite the announcement, the Delhi government is not giving free ration to 60 lakh people who do not have ration cards,” said Bidhuri. No reaction was available from the Delhi government despite TOI’s attempts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ration-bjp-says-people-being-misled/articleshow/87560389.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Madurai||Two hero stones recovered from Madurai roadside||MADURAI: A researcher has identified two hero stones at Kallandhiri in Madurai after local people recovered them during a road extension work. Harun Basha, a teacher and an Aaseevagam researcher, found the hero stones on the side of the Madurai-Alagarkovil road at Kallandhiri, at a distance of around 1 km between them. He said that the stones were moved from its original place due to road extension work but were safely recovered and maintained by local people for years. One stone, which depicted a husband and wife with a faceless dog, was identified in front of Kallandhiri primary health centre. “The stone was recently painted, as locals thought it was made of cement. The woman depicted with her hand raised with a flower towards the husband represents a woman who died while performing ‘Sati’ during the Nayakar period dated around 16th century AD,” said the researcher. Similar stones were found in Peraiyur, Kallupatti areas in Madurai and Sangampatti, Kokkarasan Kottai in Tuticorin. The second hero stone was found at a short distance from the first stone and the local people had kept it aside for worshipping. This stone depicts a man holding a small knife in his hand, which usually represents those who died during ‘Nirai Kavarthal’ or the practice of abducting cows during war. “The area is known for kallars and kallazhagar. Kallars are known for this practice. This can be from the period between 8th and 12th century AD,” said Harun Basha. Similar stones can be found in Kollimalai, Palapattu in Madurai and Villupuram. On the backside of the second stone, there were inscriptions with letters in Tamil that could be read as ‘Azhagar’, the researcher said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hero-stones-found-during-road-work/articleshow/87560388.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Complete ban on single-use plastic in forest areas from next week||Ranchi: From next week onwards, all the sanctuaries, parks, zoos and protected areas owned and run by the state forest department will implement the blanket ban on single use plastic in their jurisdiction. The state forest department on November 3 has formally notified an order signed by the chief wildlife warden Rajiv Ranjan. The department in its order has also sounded stringent fiscal penalty and jail term in case of violations — Rs 25,000 fine and three-year jail term or both. Confirming the issuance of the order, Ranjan told TOI on Saturday that the idea is to curb plastic wastage inside the protected forest areas and safeguard health hazards on the wildlife. “Orders have been sent to all the divisions asking them to implement the ban with immediate effect. To my knowledge, Dalma elephant sanctuary has already began doing it. From next week, Betla national park too will do it. Others too will have to comply with the order. The main purpose is to curb harmful effects of SUP on animals and larger environment at large,” he said. “We are working out a model of token system at the entry gates where visitors have to declare the items they are carrying with them. In case they are taking single-use plastic with them, we will issue a unique token to them. We will keep an identical matching token with us. Upon returning, they will have to deposit all the discarded plastic at the earmarked box at the gate, submit the matching token to us, and leave.” He added that all entities are also brainstorming further way outs. “The violators will be penalised under section 51 of the Indian Wildlife Act, 1972 which has a maximum of three years jail term, or Rs 25,000 fine or both,” he said. There are 12 national parks and sanctuaries in Jharkhand and three zoos. Ranchi’s Bhagwan Birsa Biological Park is owned by the forest department and two other zoos in Bokaro and Jamshedpur each are private owned by Bokaro Steel Plant and Tata Steel respectively. The Union government has set a target to phase out single-use plastic from the country by mid 2022. Earlier this year, it has notified the Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules, 2021 which prohibits the manufacture, import, stocking, distribution, sale and use of several single-use plastic items. As per the rules, plastic items having thickness of less than 100 microns are single-use plastic some of which include ice-cream and candy wrappers, earbuds, thermocol, plastic flags, cups, glasses among others. Reacting to the move, Samir Pandey, a wholesaler trader of plastic cutlery and items at Upper Bazar, said, “From the environment point of view, I welcome the ban, but the government must ensure that single-use plastics are banned from the manufacturing point rather than crackdown on retailers. It is because, wholesalers or retailers will sell the items that are provided to them from stockists and manufacturers and they must not be held liable for punishment. Most importantly, the state government or the enforcement agencies must also ensure that proper arrangements for disposal of such waste be created first.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/complete-ban-on-single-use-plastic-in-forest-areas-from-next-week/articleshow/87560241.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||Surveillance, testing to be ramped up during Chhath||Ranchi: As the state government relaxed the Covid-19 norms to allow Chhath Puja festivities, the health department issued fresh guidelines considering a possible surge in case after the festival. In an order, the National Health Mission’s (NHM) state unit director Ramesh Gholap asked all deputy commissioners to minimize the risk of any potential surge by strengthening surveillance and testing the migratory population. The order also directed the district authorities to sanitize all water bodies and places of worship of Chhath, every six hours and monitor neighbouring areas. It also asked the authorities to strengthen the testing mechanism at all entry and exit points and deploy sufficient teams after arranging the necessary logistics. Talking to TOI, state epidemiologist Dr Praveen Karn said, “As there is a possibility of a surge in Covid-19 cases post festivities due to the relaxation of norms. Hence, we have decided to strengthen the surveillance and testing so that any kind of infection is identified and isolated immediately before it spreads.” Dr Karn further said they are focussing on crowd control and restricting the number of persons offering prayers in ghats and water bodies. “We are also encouraging the devotees to organise Chhath Puja at home and focussing on publicising the same for the benefit of the masses,” he said. Apart from ramping up testing and surveillance across Chhath ghats, the department has also directed the district authorities to speed up the vaccination campaign and enforce the Covid appropriate behaviour among the masses. “We are continuing with the five-fold strategy of test-track-treat-vaccinate and adhere to the Covid appropriate behaviour so that we can avoid a possible surge. We have also directed the railways and the airport authorities to ensure proper screening and testing of all inward passengers from various parts of the country to ensure that any suspected person is isolated on time,” Karn added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/surveillance-testing-to-be-ramped-up-during-chhath/articleshow/87560213.cms||Gaurav Pandey

---||Goa||Govt has taken concrete steps for resumption of mining, says CM Pramod Sawant||BICHOLIM: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Saturday said that the state government has taken concrete steps for the resumption of mining in Goa by initiating the process of setting up a mining corporation. “The process is underway. If all goes well, soon the corporation will be set up and everything will be settled in stages,” Sawant told a delegation of mining workers, who met him at Ravindra Bhavan, Sakhali, with their legal advisor Ajay Prabhugaonkar and president Nilesh Karbotkar. “All our efforts are on to transport the out of lease ore and also to bring the workers under the purview of the mines by forming a mining corporation,” the chief minister said. During the visit, the workers questioned Sawant on his government’s stand on the issue of resumption of iron ore mining in Goa. They said that the code of conduct for the forthcoming assembly elections will be imposed soon, which may make it difficult to take any new measures for resumption of mining. The workers also raised the issue of payment of half salary to them from last one-and-half year. Prabhugaonkar said that the government should not take the workers for granted and asked how they can survive on the half salary. He also said that if the government resolves the issue before the election, workers will definitely support the government. But the government should not count on mining dependants’ support if mining does not resume in Goa, the legal advisor said. After listening to the workers’ grievances, the CM said that if the mining companies support the government properly, the mines will start operating soon. Sawant said that government is making efforts to restart mining and hence it should not be blamed again and again. He told the workers to question those who are responsible for closing mines. Sawant said everyone needs to unite for a definite solution. “This is not a political issue at all. I am fully aware of what has happened,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-has-taken-concrete-steps-for-resumption-of-mining-says-cm/articleshow/87560437.cms||---
---||World||Pakistan PM Imran Khan removes extremist group TLP from banned outfits||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday gave his permission to remove the extremist group Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) from the list of banned outfits, succumbing to the hardline Islamists to end the deadly anti-government agitation. The TLP was declared as a proscribed organisation in April this year after violent protests by the group to force the government to expel the French ambassador over the issue of blasphemous cartoons published in France. The group once again took to the streets last month and after violent protests entered into an agreement with the government. Though the details of the agreement were not shared with the public, it emerged from the statement of some leaders that it included the removal of a ban on the group. At least 21 people, including 10 policemen have lost their lives during fierce confrontation between the TLP workers and law enforcement authorities in recent days. Prime Minister Khan approved to lift the ban on the TLP after a report for it was sent by the Punjab government through the ministry of interior. "The prime minister has been pleased to accord permission for submission of the instant summary to the cabinet through circulation under Rule 17 (1)(b) of the Rules of Business, 1973," according to an official document. It added that "the approval of the cabinet is [now] solicited to de-proscribe the TLP under [...] Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 on the recommendation of the Punjab government." According to the Rules of Business, 1973, approval by circulation means that a summary is sent to federal ministers for their opinion. If a minister fails to respond within the stipulated time period, it is assumed that they have approved the report. The government has already released more than 2,000 activists of the TLP and after lifting of the ban, the group would be free to take part in all sorts of political activities. However, it would set a bad precedent and the future governments would be vulnerable to extremists groups and their bullying. The TLP was established in 2015 and has held at least six protests over the years, mostly against the alleged desecration of the Prophet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistan-pm-imran-khan-removes-extremist-group-tlp-from-banned-outfits/articleshow/87561555.cms||---

A day earlier, IMD had said Goa would experience rain till Sunday. It has attributed the reason for the weather conditions to the formation of a well-marked low-pressure area that now lies over the east-central Arabian Sea. “The associated cyclonic circulation extends up to 5.8km above mean sea level. It is likely to move north northwestwards and concentrate into a depression over the same region over the next 24 hours. Then it is likely to move west northwestwards, away from the west coast of India,” the IMD said. Thunderstorms accompanied by lightning are very likely at isolated places on November 7. Short, intense rain spells and winds with speeds of around 40-50kmph are also very likely. Light to moderate rainfall activity with a weaker distribution may continue over both districts after November 7, the IMD said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rainfall-to-continue-till-next-week/articleshow/87560452.cms||---

---||India||India lifts ban on Italy arms firm linked to Agusta scam||NEW DELHI: India has lifted the ban on business dealings with defence major Leonardo SpA, the erstwhile Italian conglomerate Finmeccanica enmeshed in the infamous Rs 3,546 crore VVIP helicopter scam along with its UK-based subsidiary AgustaWestland International since 2013-2014. The defence ministry’s decision to resume business with Leonardo SpA is “subject to certain conditions imposed on the company”, top government sources told TOI on Saturday. Under the conditions, Leonardo SpA cannot make any commercial claims or file any civil suit against the Indian government for any previous deal. Moreover, new business dealings will take place “without any prejudice” to the ongoing investigations into the alleged VVIP helicopter scam by the CBI and Enforcement Directorate, which will continue, the sources added. The MoD decision to lift the ban was taken after a high-level committee examined the matter on a request made by Leonardo SpA and submitted its recommendations after consultations with the law ministry. Italy has repeatedly been asking India for the ban to be lifted in bilateral talks. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also held the first in-person meeting with his Italian counterpart Mario Draghi on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Rome on October 29. Sources said the ban on Leonardo SpA and its subsidiaries had “limited India’s options” in the international arms market because the conglomerate produces a wide array of weapon systems ranging from torpedoes and 127mm naval guns to radars and short-range surface-to-air missiles. One of the earliest casualties of the scandal, in fact, was the cancellation of India’s proposed Rs 1,200 crore deal to buy Black Shark heavy-weight torpedoes from a Finmeccanica subsidiary for the six French-origin Scorpene submarines being constructed at Mazagon Docks. It was in early-2012 that allegations of Rs 360 crore being paid as bribes to Indian politicians, bureaucrats and IAF officers to swing the Rs 3,546 crore deal to supply 12 AW-101 VVIP helicopters had first surfaced in a probe by prosecutors in Italy. The deal had been inked in 2010. With the MoD first freezing all payments to AgustaWestland and then finally scrapping the contract in 2013-2014, the CBI had registered a case against former IAF chief Air Chief Marshal S P Tyagi, Finmeccanica CEO Giuseppe Orsi, AgustaWestland chief Bruno Spagnolini and alleged middleman Christian Michel James, among others. The probe is yet to be concluded, with the CBI recently telling the court that its investigation is pending for “want of complete execution of letters rogatory” sent to nine countries and other reasons. Leonardo was among the 15 arms companies on the “put on hold/suspended” list of the defence ministry till September this year. At the top are six companies, including Singapore Technologies Kinetics, Israel Military Industries, Rheinmetall Air Defence (Zurich) and Corporation Defence (Russia), which are “debarred” completely. Engine manufacturer Rolls Royce and Tatra truck manufacturer (Czech Republic), in turn, are the four companies with whom “restricted procurements” are allowed on the basis of operational urgency, national security and non-availability of other alternatives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-lifts-ban-on-italy-arms-firm-linked-to-agusta-scam/articleshow/87561597.cms||Rajat Pandit
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: High on Huzurabad win, BJP plans protest rallies||HYDERABAD: Overwhelmed by the victory of the party in Huzurabad, Telangana BJP on Saturday announced two major programmes - 'Beat the drums' on November 9 insisting on implementation of Dalit Bandhu in the state and 'Unemployed youth million march' on November 16. At a meeting to felicitate Huzurabad MLA-elect Eatala Rajender, state BJP president Bandi Sanjay Kumar said the party would take up a series of programmes to highlight failures of the state government. "The BJP will fight till the TRS government releases a notification for recruitment and carry out protest programmes till the government slashes state tax on petrol and diesel and procures paddy in the state," Sanjay said at the meeting. "When the Centre has cut taxes both on petrol and diesel, why is the state government not reducing its tax on the fuel," he asked. He said though the TRS lured the voters of Huzurabad by offering money, they supported the BJP. "I salute the people of Huzurabad for their maturity as they stood by dharma. The entire country is looking at Huzurabad," Sanjay said. He said two or three more by-elections were likely in the state soon and that BJP will win every bypoll. Eatala said in Telangana only KCR's 'constitution' was being implemented instead of Indian Constitution written by BR Ambedkar. "Though the ruling party spent several crores of rupees, people taught him a lesson in Huzurabad. This has proven that Telangana people are ready to die, but will not lose their self-respect," the former TRS minister said. Eatala reached the Nampally party office in a vehicle rally from his residence at Shamirpet. He paid tributes to Telangana martyrs at Gun Park near the assembly. Eatala, who turned emotional at the felicitation event, said he dedicates his victory to the people of Huzurabad who stood by him despite facing harassment and threats from TRS leaders. He alleged that police and election authorities worked for the ruling party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-high-on-huzurabad-win-bjp-plans-protest-rallies/articleshow/87561647.cms||Koride Mahesh

Now, water is available at 5ft depth in most of these recharge wells, says Rain Centre's director Sekhar Raghavan. Sharing details with the TOI, Raghavan said the recharge wells had not only helped in increasing the level of groundwater, but also prevented water stagnation on rainy days. The wells were around 4ft in diameter with a depth of 15ft. Resident Welfare Associations in Karpagam Gardens, Adyar, Lake Area in Nungambakkam, Mylapore, T Nagar and Kalakshetra Colony in Besant Nagar showed keen interest to dig the wells on their roads, where water stagnation has been an issue, he said. After water began to be available at 5ft depth in the wells, many residents wanted such recharge wells within their homes too. But, Rain Centre's aim was to reduce run-off, avoid flooding on roads and recharging the groundwater table, hence the centre dug wells only on the roads, Raghavan said. In Mylapore, former MLA R Nataraj spent a substantial amount from his MLA area development fund to dig the wells. This time, Wipro Foundation is helping the cause by funding 50% of the total cost of the wells dug by Rain Centre. Now 40 more wells are planned to be dug up. A sum of Rs23,000 is needed for digging a recharge well with 3ft diameter and 15ft depth. Last time it was the resident welfare associations whose funds were used for this purposee. Similarly, the Greater Chennai Corporation too dug such wells in some of the residential localities. With the funds from the corporate house this year, welfare associations need to pay only half of the total sum required for the work. With the existing favourable groundwater table situation, there should not be any water scarcity in the Greater Chennai area in the next one year, Raghavan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/recharge-pits-across-chennai-keep-roads-dry/articleshow/87561670.cms||P Oppili
---||Chennai||Chennai: Flowers, veggies end up in trash at Koyambedu||CHENNAI: About 75 tonnes of flowers and vegetables went to waste at the wholesale market in Koyambedu follwing poor demand. While the wholesale market received an excess of chrysanthemum on the eve of Diwali, continuous rain and low footfall led to wastage of the flower. The number of flowers and vegetables that got rotten was also high, compared to other days. According to market sources, the Koyambedu market received collectively about 900 tonnes of chrysanthemums on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, after prices of the flower spiralled on Wednesday. S Mookaiah, president of Chennai Koyambedu Flower Traders Association said the rate of chrysanthemum increased to nearly 30 on the eve of Diwali. "The price hike created an interest and led to diversion of chrysanthemums from Salem and Hosur, besides Kadapa in Andhra Pradesh that were meant for other places to the city market. But, the rates suddenly dropped to Rs10 per kilogram in the past two days as there were few takers," he said. With the demand mostly for jasmine, the following two days spelled doom for chrusanthemum farmers. "We had an excessive supply of chrysanthemums due to the volume of yield, but the demand was low," he said. On Saturday, vendors were seen dumping tonnes and tonnes of crates containing chrysanthemum at the Koyambedu Wholesale Market Complex (KWMC). The wholesale price of the chrysanthemum that was wasted is about 5 lakh, which would have sold at least three times its cost in the retail market. Vendors can make garlands of roughly 10ft with just 1kg of the flower. At the vegetable section in Koyambedu, 25 tonnes of vegetables, largely cucumber and pumpkin, went to the waste. The volume of vegetables that landed in the garbage was high when compared to other days. While its wholesale cost is 1.45 lakh, the retail price is worth at least 3.5 lakh. S Chandran, secretary of Federation of Wholesale Vegetable Market Associations at Koyambedu said cucumber and pumpkin went bad due to rain. "The number of visitors to Koyambedu had decreased in the past few days. Cucumber and pumpkin alone accounted for about 20 tonnes of the vegetables that were wasted," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-flowers-veggies-end-up-in-trash-at-koyambedu/articleshow/87561700.cms||A Prathap

Chennai was also the only district to report cases in three digits, when the state reported ten deaths, discharged 1,009 patients and reported 10,588 people in the active cases registry. Public health officials said it would be too early to attribute any spike to the festival, although they don't entirely rule out the possibility of increase in clusters. "There could have been delays in consultation and testing during the festival days, which can push up cases marginally. But lack of masks and social distancing combined with vaccine hesitancy can push up cases," said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. Over the last two weeks, the test positivity rate has been below 1% indicating no surge in transmission, he said. At least 26 districts reported fewer than 20 cases on Saturday, of which 19 districts reported fewer than 10 cases each. After Chennai, Coimbatore reported 99 new cases followed by Chengalpet (79) and Erode (67).

---||Mumbai||Nawab Malik seeks another SIT inquiry, declares war on Sameer Wankhede's ‘private army’||MUMBAI: A day after the NCB entrusted the investigation against Aryan Khan to a high-level team led by a deputy director general, NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said he had demanded an SIT investigation against zonal director Sameer Wankhede for kidnapping and making ransom demands from megastar Shah Rukh Khan’s son. After Malik’s demand, there will be two SITs, one by the state government and the other by NCB. “Let us see who brings out the skeletons from the closet of Wankhede and exposes him and his nefarious private army. I will be disclosing the hidden secrets of Hotel Lalit as well as the private army on Sunday,” Nawab Malik said. According to reports, Malik is likely to display CCTV footage showing a section of witnesses involved in the Aryan Khan case. In the case, it was found that the main witness, Kiran Gosavi, was a criminal and wanted in at least four cases of cheating. Currently, he is in custody of the Pune police. Another witness, Vilas Bhanushali, is a BJP activist, while yet another witness, Prabhakar Sail, has filed an affidavit against Gosavi and a few other witnesses. Apparently, alarmed by the stringent criticism over the manner in which it handled the Aryan Khan case, the NCB on Friday set up a high-level team led by DDG Sanjay Singh to take over six cases, including the Aryan Khan case from the Mumbai unit, which have national and international ramifications, in order to conduct deeper investigation. Wankhede was investigating the Aryan Khan case. In the wake of reports that he has been removed, the NCB made it clear that no officer or officers have been removed from their present roles and they will continue to assist the operations branch investigation as required. “I have not been removed from investigation, it was my writ petition that the case be probed by a central agency, CBI or NIA. Now the Aryan Khan and Sameer Khan cases are being probed by Delhi’s NCB SIT,” Wankhede said. Malik said now that Wankhede has been removed from five cases, all the 26 cases registered in the recent past must be entrusted to the new SIT. A week ago, Malik had received a list of 26 cases which he handed over to the NCB director general. Malik’s contention was that the raid on cruise ship on October 2 was fake and fabricated. Malik reiterated that his campaign will come to an end on the day Wankhede loses his job for securing it on the basis of a forged caste certificate. Malik’s contention is that while Wankhede is a Muslim, he has secured the prestigious job under the Scheduled Caste category on the basis of a forged caste certificate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/malik-seeks-another-sit-inquiry-declares-war-on-sameer-private-army/articleshow/87561709.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Mumbai||Unseasonal November showers cool Mumbai down in Diwali weekend||MUMBAI: Rains were witnessed in various parts of South Mumbai on the Diwali weekend. The suburbs saw some precipitation as well, but in significantly less measure. The light drizzle on Friday evening started from parts of the island city and continued over suburbs like Chembur, Goregaon and the neighbouring cities of Thane and Navi Mumbai. In the 24 hours ending 8.30am on Saturday, the IMD Colaba observatory recorded 10.2 mm rain, while the Santacruz observatory witnessed only trace amounts of rain. This falls in the light rain category, as per IMD classification. Throughout Saturday, cloudy skies were seen. Dr Jayanta Sarkar, scientist and head at IMD Mumbai, said the city experienced this rain activity owing to a wellmarked low pressure area over east central Arabian sea. “From Sunday onwards, it will reduce, with further reduction from the day after that,” said Sarkar. The city recorded no rain in November last year, while in November 2019, 109 mm rain was recorded, making it the highest for the month in a decade. Meanwhile, on Friday, prior to the rains, the maximum temperature recorded by the IMD Santa Cruz observatory was 37 degrees Celsius, making it the second highest for November since the year 2016. Previously, in 2018, the highest maximum temperature had touched 37.6 degrees on November 4. By Saturday, the rains ensured that the maximum temperatures dipped with the IMD Santacruz recording maximum temperatures of 33.9 degrees which was 0.5 degrees Celsius below normal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-unseasonal-november-showers-cool-city-down-in-diwali-weekend/articleshow/87561735.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Muslims form panel in Gurugram for namaz talks||GURUGRAM: The Muslim community has formed a 21-member committee under the chairmanship of former Rajya Sabha member Mohammad Adeeb to interact with the government and representatives of political parties and find a peaceful solution to holding Friday prayers in the city. Various right-wing outfits and some local residents have over the past few weeks protested against namaz in public places. In the latest demonstration this Friday, an organisation of local outfits performed Govardhan Puja at a namaz site in Sector 12 and one of the speakers declared that those who want to offer namaz in a public place should go to Pakistan. “The committee was formed so that we can find a solution wherever Muslims of Gurugram are facing challenges in offering namaz,” said Altaf Ahmad, a member of the committee and also part of Gurugram Nagrik Ekta Manch, a local outfit that had earlier petitioned the government to allow namaz to be conducted without disruptions in the city. The engagement with government officials and the political leadership will start from Monday, beginning with a five-member delegation from the committee holding talks with Gurugram deputy commissioner Yash Garg. The delegation, said community members, will submit a memorandum to not reduce sites from the list of 37 places agreed on in 2018. “Instead, we need more places in newer sectors as more Muslim migrant workers have come to the city in the past 3 years,” said Altaf. Eight of the sites have already been taken off the list, citing objections from locals and following a memorandum last week from Muslim community representatives that they were ready to stop offering namaz in the open for the sake of harmony. The district administration has set up a committee to designate afresh sites for namaz. Police had last week issued a statement, saying permission for namaz at other sites could be withdrawn if locals raised any objections. “We’ll also seek an appointment with the chief minister and appeal to him to grant us land for building mosques in Gurugram in accordance with town planning guidelines. We’ll request stern action against those who are working towards disturbing communal harmony in Gurugram,” said Altaf, adding the committee also wanted to meet deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala and leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda. Members of the committee are, meanwhile, trying to identify land where Friday prayers can be offered, which includes those owned by private individuals and organisations that have offered to help. Once the land is available, the committee will seek approval from the government. Adeeb said the Constitution gives everyone the right to practise religion but a situation had unfortunately been created where those rights were being denied. “We are going to engage with the political leadership of the state with the hope to find a solution to the problem created by a group of people,” said Adeeb. Mufti Mohammad Salim Qasmi, president of Jamiat Ulema Hind Gurugram and another member of the committee formed by the community for talks, said they are ready to bear the construction cost of mosques but need land for it. “We request the government to allot us land where we can construct mosques,” Qasmi said, adding people offer namaz close to their workplace for convenience.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/muslims-form-panel-for-talks-with-govt-political-parties-on-namaz/articleshow/87560650.cms||Bagish Jha
---||Goa||Unusually wet November sees surplus swell to 77%||Panaji: November has been unusually wet this year as it has rained every day for almost a week. The India meteorological department (IMD) has recorded a total of state average rainfall of 55.1mm in six days. While rainfall of 164.7mm is considered normal at this stage, after a wet October, the post-seasonal total has touched 291.5mm. The surplus, with widespread rain during the last few days, has now touched 77%. While farmers are lamenting crop damage due to heavy rain in some parts, a low pressure area over east-central and adjoining southeast Arabian Sea - that has intensified into a well-marked low pressure area by Saturday – has triggered more rain. Sakhali received the highest rainfall of 37.2mm during the last 24 hours, Old Goa 34mm, Valpoi 28.1mm, Mapusa 22.6mm and other centres on a lesser scale. With the slow moving system at around 600km distance from Goa’s coast, it is not expected to have any other significant impact other than the ongoing thunderstorm activities. Of course, the high wind speed and rough sea conditions will prevail off coast and warnings for fishermen have been issued accordingly," IMD, Panaji, scientist Rahul M said. The system is likely to concentrate into a depression during the next 24 hours and move west northwestwards, away from west coast Thunderstorms, which will be more prevalent in north Goa, are likely to continue on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/unusually-wet-november-sees-surplus-swell-to-77/articleshow/87560369.cms||Paul Fernandes
---||Lucknow||25-30 lakh Covid-19 jabs per day must for last mile coverage: Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: In a bid to accelerate Covid-19 vaccination in the state, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday directed officials concerned to undertake 25-30 lakh vaccinations per day. The purpose of the exercise is to ensure that the maximum number of eligible persons in the state are fully immunised against the pandemic virus. The CM’s direction is crucial in the backdrop of rising cases of Covid-19 in several countries of the world and in some Indian states. At a high-level meeting, the CM told officials to find out reasons which are keeping people away from vaccination centres and initiate corrective measures. “A target should be set to vaccinate around 25 to 30 lakh people daily to achieve the last mile coverage of the eligible population,” the CM said in the meeting. He also told additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad, to undertake district wise assessment of the vaccine coverage to identify low vaccination pockets with a solution-oriented frame of mind. As per data from the Co-Win Portal, 9.90 crore of the estimated 15.04 crore eligible persons have taken at least one dose in Uttar Pradesh while 3.38 crore persons are fully immunised. The total number of doses extended in the state is 13.29 crore which is highest by any state in the country. Earlier, the CM had issued a deadline to vaccinate 100% eligible population by December 15. He had asked the health officials to come up with a special drive to enthuse and motivate people towards vaccination against the deadly infection. Health officials said that the cluster model – launched in July to boost primary vaccination against the pandemic virus speedily – has been tweaked to accelerate the second dose coverage as well. “The government has adopted and launched the ‘Cluster Model 2.0’ from November 1 to improve the second dose coverage in the state. Giving priority to the full vaccination, the work of applying the second dose using the cluster model 2.0 is being done in those villages/localities where the first dose was successfully administered through the cluster model,” an official statement issued by the government said. Meanwhile, they continued to emphasise on the importance of preventive measures and Covid-19 appropriate behaviour even as just seven fresh cases were reported in the past 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/25-30-lakh-jabs-per-day-must-for-last-mile-coverage-uttar-pradesh-cm-yogi-adityanath/articleshow/87561782.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Goa||Goa looks to eliminate malaria by 2022||PANAJI: It has taken Goa almost three decades to reach the elimination stage for malaria. However, the battle is far from over even as the incidences of indigenous cases have hugely reduced from 25,000 cases in 1998 to 68 reported this year till September-end. The state recorded 400 ‘imported’ cases from January till September, which were detected largely among migrant labourers. To achieve elimination status, Goa has to see zero indigenous cases and nil deaths and is set to achieve the target by 2022 along with 15 states. The directorate of health services (DHS) has doubled its efforts towards this end. “Goa’s high load of malaria is owing to migrant labourers. Whenever the influx of migrants goes up, so does the malaria caseload. It is difficult to reach a base level post-November, after the end of the malaria period from June to October. No sooner than monsoon ends, construction starts,” health officer in charge of the national vector-borne disease control programme in Goa, Dr Kalpana Mahatme said. Goa has not reported a single death since 2017 and the incidence of malaria has drastically declined among the local population. “Any person who has lived in Goa for 21 or more days and tests positive is counted as an indigenous case,” Mahatme said. The focus of DHS has been containing transmission in migrant settlements, which are mostly construction sites. Health cards have to be made by a contractor within 24 to 48 hours of the arrival of his labourers. The contractor is directly responsible for getting health cards done for his workers and failure on his part attracts punitive action. “Earlier, DHS was not so strict and only notices were issued to contractors. Now, if a violation is detected, a contractor is penalised under the Goa Public Health Act. A fine of Rs 10,000 per head is imposed on a contractor if any of his labourers do not have a health card,” the health officer said. This year between January and September the DHS has collected Rs 3.6 lakh in fines from contractors. Long-lasting insecticide (LLI) treated nets that are provided by the government of India are given to construction and other workers. “LLI netss are not to be given to Goa, but for states such as Odisha and those in the north east. However, during a review meeting we informed the authorities that since Goa has a high presence of migrant labourers from other states we should be provided with LLI nets, too,” Mahatme said. Besides migrants, LLI nets are also given to people below the poverty line residing close to construction sites. Goa has been allotted about 92,000 nets to date, but has received 62,000, she said. To meet the target of elimination of malaria, the DHS has been very strict in tracing, tracking and treating a single case, Mahatme said. “Sometimes beggars, rokda workers and others don’t return to take their reports and they are lost. Losing a patient means the transmission of infection. Health centres have been directed to run a Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) for patients having a fever. If RDT is positive, malaria treatment is started immediately. Then it doesn’t matter if a patient does not turn up for the follow up,” she said. Every construction site is visited by health workers and anti-larval measures are supervised. Each contractor has been instructed to designate a person to conduct anti-larval measures, which are supervised by a health worker. “All these efforts have helped to reduce malaria infections,” Mahatme said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-looks-to-eliminate-malaria-by-2022/articleshow/87560382.cms||Bindiya Chari

Covid-19 is to be blamed as some people ended died by suicide for want of drugs and alcohol during the lockdown period in 2020. The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report titled 'Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India' says 385 people including nine women and one transgender committed suicide in Andhra Pradesh in 2020, due to drug abuse and alcohol addiction. In 2019, 302 people, including seven women ended their life because of drug abuse and alcoholism. Though there is no reliable data on ganja (weed, hemp, cannabis) consumption in Andhra Pradesh, it is estimated that around 0.2 per cent people use cannabis products in the state. Some people use sedative drugs, LSD and a few others. Experts in the health department say curiosity, peer pressure and attempts to stimulate sexual desires are the key reasons for youngsters to get addicted to drugs such as ganja and alcohol in cities and towns. In Andhra Pradesh, every year, more people are joining the ranks of drug addicts. Drug abuse and alcoholism have been driving at least 250 to 300 persons, including a few women, to suicide every year in state, they added. During the Covid-19 lockdown period, some people committed suicide as they could not source alcohol or drugs. Speaking to TOI, Dr Uma Mahendra Raj of Greenvalley Foundation, which deals with substance-addicted patients in parts of the state, said, "Covid-19 pandemic has created different conditions. Some people, who had given up drugs, started using them again. Increased stress, boredom, loss of livelihood, anxiety and a few other factors have triggered a spike in the use of cannabis and other drugs. Overuse of drugs and difficulty in getting them were also reasons for the suicides," she added. Noted psychiatrist NN Raju said, "Fear and free time during the pandemic led to anxiety and depression.. As a result, some people got addicted to drugs and alcohol."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/27-increase-in-drug-related-suicides-in-andhra-pradesh-says-ncrb-report/articleshow/87561786.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Kolkata||Dengue patient count catches up with Covid numbers in Kolkata hospitals||KOLKATA: The number of Covid admissions hasn’t seen a significant spurt in Kolkata so far but a continuous flow of dengue patients over the last two weeks has left city hospitals and doctors on tenterhooks. In fact, the number of dengue patients in some hospitals currently equal that of Covid patients or exceeded it marginally. While dengue cases are fewer than Covid cases in hospitals along the EM Bypass, their number is slightly higher in south Kolkata hospitals. “We have seen a spike in dengue cases in the last one week. Currently, we have 24 dengue patients admitted in our hospital. Majority of them are residents of localities within a 5-km radius of our hospital. While Covid seems to be under control, the dengue number is a cause of worry,” said Simmardeep Gill, CEO, CK Biral Hospitals CMRI. Against 24 dengue patients, CMRI had 22 Covid patients on Saturday. Most hospitals said they it did not have so many dengue admissions last year. “Unlike last year, dengue is creating quite a ripple this year. Right now, we have 16 dengue patients against 15 Covid cases. Most of these patients are from areas like Ballygunge and adjoining areas,” said Pradip Tondon, CEO, Belle Vue Clinic. Last year, as Covid dominated, the city did not see that many cases of other infections or tropical diseases, including dengue and malaria. This year, the first dengue death was reported on September 22, when a 19-year-old boy succumbed to the vector-borne disease at a private hospital. “Around 7% of our admitted patients have dengue and 3% have malaria. Both have seen a spurt in the last ten days,” said Rupali Basu, managing director & CEO of Woodlands Multispeciality Hospital. “We have a total of 18 admitted Covid patients which is 12% of all admitted cases. All fever patients account for 22% or admitted patients and is either dengue, malaria or Covid,” Basu added. On Saturday, the three units of AMRI together had 32 dengue and 8 malaria patients, half of this at its Salt Lake unit. The three hospital units currently have 53 Covid patients, including 23 in ICU. Narayan Memorial Hospital Behala has three dengue patients including one in ICU against 5 covid patients. “Dengue and malaria cases started rising about a month and half ago. The inflow of patients is still on and on any given day we have about 10 patients admitted with either dengue or malaria,” said Subhasish Datta, general manager operations at Ruby Hospital. Health officials said strengthening of dengue/malaria surveillance by Kolkata Municipal Corporation could be a reason for more detection. Few hospitals like Peerlesss and RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS), however, have few dengue cases. “Somehow, we are getting only a handful of dengue cases this year too. But we lost two patients who came seeking treatment when their condition was already critical,” said Sudipta Mitra CEO Peerless Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dengue-patient-count-catches-up-with-covid-numbers-in-city-hosps/articleshow/87560752.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Home Solutions Ride The Festive Tide||Kolkata: If any industry was partially immune to the Covid-induced economic slowdown, it was that of home appliances. In fact, when the pandemic was raging across India, this segment witnessed an unprecedented growth, evidently catalysed by a thitherto unfamiliar and confined lifestyle. The shooting sales graph plateaued once restrictions were eased and the world saw some semblance of normalcy following the second wave. However, the discount-driven festive season has again ushered in the buy-buy spirit. Krishna Raman, the president and business head (consumer products) of Bajaj Electricals, said the demand was particularly high for kitchen appliances. “Microwave ovens, OTGs and mixer-grinders have been flying off the shelves since work-from-home (WFH) became the norm. There was a temporary contraction in demand for home appliances after the lockdown period, but now the festive season is driving the consumer product category and a double-digit growth in sales looks very achievable,” he said. The consumer products segment of Bajaj earned a whopping Rs 617 crore in the first quarter of 2021-22 as against Rs 395 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal, thereby recording a 56.3% growth in revenue. For Kutchina Home Makers, festive sales have been steady if not as great as last year. “In 2020, there was a huge demand for kitchen appliances as Covid restrictions resulted in an increased preference for home-cooked meals while many people also discovered their passion for cooking. With WFH becoming a semi-permanent fixture, the demand for other home appliances saw a rise too,” said Namit Bajoria, the managing director of Kutchina. Bajoria said sales were expected to soar in Q4 of the current fiscal. “In the next two-three years, the demand for modular kitchens will surge manifold because of the growing preference for aesthetics, space management issues and skyrocketing real estate prices, which are compelling many families to shift to smaller flats,” he added. Kutchina is already coming up with a modular kitchen factory on Kona Expressway. Chairman and CEO of Panasonic India Manish Sharma said they were witnessing a gradual shift in consumer behaviour towards value proposition products. “We have seen a 20% growth in home appliances. Products such as cameras, AV accessories, irons, microwave ovens and mixer-grinders have performed well for us this year. E-commerce is boosting the trend, driving the penetration for such products across tier III markets,” he said. The FMEG market is growing in Bengal like other parts of India, according to Kishan Jain, director of Goldmedal Electricals that manufactures switches, electrical accessories, home automation systems, LED lights and fans. It has a retail presence in more than 1 lakh stores in the country. “Based on our sales figures, we can say Bengal is emerging as a key market for us. Given the potential, we have come up with two experience centres in Kolkata and Siliguri. We were worried during the pandemic, but with the help of our channel partners we were able to carry out business without interruptions. Since electrical goods were put in the category of essentials, disruptions were minimal. We have had a successful run throughout the pandemic and we are on the way to meet our Rs 2,300 crore revenue target for 2021-22,” Jain said. Jain reminded that the global supply chain went haywire amid the pandemic, causing a major crunch of raw materials and spare parts. Syska Group, which was involved in the distribution of T-series cassettes, CDs and audio-video systems since 1989, diversified into various segments including home appliances in 2012. Gurumukh Uttamchandani, executive director of the group, said: “The pandemic has changed purchasing patterns of consumers. We are introducing innovative products to harness the sales potential of our segment. In the past 18 months, when most people stayed indoors, we saw a spike in demand for earphones, headphones, charging cables and other accessories. Besides, the pandemic also boosted sales of fitness-related gear.” Rakesh Kaul, CEO and whole-time director of Somany Home Innovation, said they had a network of 10,000-plus retail outlets and Bengal was an important market. “Our home appliances business is spread over categories like chimneys, water heaters, air coolers and fans. We are keen to expand business in this state. Recently, we launched our fourth exclusive kitchen gallery in Kolkata and the 30th in Bengal. The gallery houses appliances like autoclean chimneys, hobs and cooktops, among others. People have started going out shopping and this makes us optimistic about good sales,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/home-solutions-ride-the-festive-tide/articleshow/87560374.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Joy Banerjee writes to PM, says he wants to quit BJP||Kolkata: Failing to retain his place in the BJP national executive committee, actor-turned-BJP leader Joy Banerjee on Saturday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying he wanted to “quit the party”, but “wants to continue working for the people”. Banerjee didn’t comment on whether he planned to join the Trinamool Congress. “I want to work for the common man and that isn’t quite possible if I continue to be a part of the BJP,” he told reporters. Mentioning that he had been removed from the BJP national executive, Banerjee further said: “My security has also been taken away by the central leadership. I am not a new member; I had joined the party way back in 2014.” He cited the example of Rajib Banerjee. “In 2016, I was made a national executive member, but this year I was left out and Rajib Banerjee was included. He (Rajib Banerjee) joined TMC,” the leader wrote. In his two-page letter to the PM that included Diwali greetings, Banerjee said he had been trying for the past two years to get an appointment but had failed and thus chose to write. “Now, I want to leave BJP and so, I need your permission. Please allow me to leave,” he wrote. To a specific question on if he had any plan to join the Trinamool, Banerjee said he had not taken any such decision yet. “All I know is that I want to work for the people,” he reiterated. Banerjee, who has been ailing for sometime, had also sought medical help, which was apparently overlooked. BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha said: “Everyone has the right to leave the party, but one thing I must admit that we failed to stand beside him. This is true. We should have stood beside him when he was in trouble.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/joy-banerjee-writes-to-pm-says-he-wants-to-quit-bjp/articleshow/87560334.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||BMC sitting on 5 lakh+ doses as citizens get lax amid festivals||MUMBAI: For the first time since the Covid vaccination drive began on January 16, the BMC has stocks of over 5 lakh vaccine doses, but few takers. Civic officials say due to the festival season, even those scheduled to take the second shot have kept away. Second vaccine hesitancy is emerging as a trend across the country—nearly 16 crore doses were available with states and UTs on Saturday —while 7 crore due for their second shot were still to take it. Only 2.42 crore doses were administered in the country during the Diwali week ending November 5, around 50% of the over 4 crore doses given during October 23-29. Meanwhile, total inoculations have crossed 108 crore doses. 'Second shot conversion of Covid vaccine is better in urban areas'Experts aren't sure if the fall in vaccination is due to the festival season alone or also the result of poor awareness in non-metro areas. "The polio campaign was very specific about two drops and polio Sundays, but there is no direct message that Covid vaccination entails two shots. We only hear a general message about the availability of Covid vaccination," Sachin Pandey, a Gandhinagar professor who maintains vaccination data on his website https://covidtikaherokuapp.com, said. Pandey added that the second dose conversion (the ratio between the number of fully vaccinated people and the number of people vaccinated with the first dose 84 days back) is poor in 21 states and Union territories. While the all-India ratio is 0.826, the corresponding figure for Maharashtra stands at 0.883. However, Pandey said a closer look at district-wise data showed that second shot conversion is better in urban centres. In Mumbai and Delhi, for instance, the ratio is 0.937and 0.927 respectively. "However, in Noida, which includes some rural pockets as well, the conversion is 0.694," he said. He added,"Seeing the city-wise data and comparing it to the whole state, it seems the second dose conversion is less in rural areas. These areas would do better with awareness on the need to take the second dose." However, in Mumbai, where the first dose vaccination is close to 99% and the full two-dose vaccination at 61%, officials from Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation are struggling to boost the latter. "We are calling up people, we are surveying housing colonies and slums to find out people who have delayed their second dose, and so we have made mobile centres available," said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. Kakani is hopeful that vaccination will pick up pace after the Diwali festival is over. The BMC had stopped vaccination for four days due to poor turnout during Diwali; vaccination in public centres will resume on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-sitting-on-5-lakh-doses-as-citizens-get-lax-amid-festivals/articleshow/87561804.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi chokes on ‘severe’ air for second day in a row||NEW DELHI: Delhiites continued to breathe a deadly cocktail of toxic gases with the air quality remaining “severe” for the second day after Diwali, as pollutants largely remained trapped over the region even though winds picked up for a few hours. Meanwhile, the share of farm fires in the city’s PM2.5 pollution rose to 41% as stubble-burning began to peak in the neighbouring states. The overall AQI in the city saw a marginal improvement from 462 on Friday to 437 on Saturday. Smog appeared again in the morning, reducing visibility to 600-800 metres between 5.30am and 9.30am. Each of the last three days has seen the share of stubble-burning in the city’s PM2.5 level touch a new season’s high. Slight improvement may make air quality ‘very poor’It was 25% on Diwali and 36% on Friday. According to experts, air quality remained in the “severe” zone mainly due to rising share of stubble burning, calm wind conditions, low temperatures, low mixing height and transportation of dust from Rajasthan. The minimum temperature was 14.7 degrees Celsius, which prevented the dispersal of pollutants while the low mixing height kept the toxic layer of air close to the land surface. The wind speed increased during the day but calm conditions were again observed later in the day, causing accumulation of pollutants. “The wind speed at Safdarjung and Palam was reported around 10 to 15kmph till 4pm, which then slowed down to calm or light winds. Wind direction remained from westerly to north-northwesterly,” said R K Jenamani, senior scientist at India Meteorological Department (IMD). He added, “Fog/smog conditions improved in Delhi on Saturday morning as compared to Friday. Shallow fog was observed at visibility range of 600 to 800 meter at Safdarjung and Palam from 5.30 am to 9.30am. Visibility remained at 800-1,200m later in the day with a smog persisting.” Mahesh Palawat of Skymet Weather, a private weather forecasting agency, said, “The wind speed was almost calm on Friday night but the wind speed picked up on Saturday for around four hours, helping in dispersal of pollutants. However, wind later again slowed down but moderate to strong winds are expected on Sunday.” Dipankar Saha, former head of CPCB’s air laboratory, said, “Low wind speed, low mixing height and low temperatures made the pollutants accumulate in the atmosphere. At the same time, as the wind direction was westerly to north-westerly, the emissions from Punjab and Haryana and dust from Rajasthan side were transported to Delhi region.” He added that the air quality is likely to gradually improve if there is improvement in ventilation, wind speed or mixing height. The Central Pollution Control Board’s central control room data showed that Delhi-NCR's average 24-hour PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations were 429 micrograms per cubic metre and 298 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively, at 7pm. The standard PM10 and PM2.5 is 100 and 60 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively. With IMD forecasting strong surface winds at 20-30 kmph on Sunday, the air quality may see an improvement. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), a pollution monitoring body under the Union ministry of earth sciences, said, “Delhi’s AQI is likely to improve to upper end of ‘very poor’ category as surface winds are becoming stronger, dispersing air pollutants. Strong northwesterly winds enhance transport of emissions from stubble burning. Share of crop residue burning emissions in PM2.5 is 41% (Effective fire count 5,159).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-chokes-on-severe-air-for-second-day-in-a-row/articleshow/87561843.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Kolkata||Bharatpur beel, a bird paradise, saved from makhana monster||KOLKATA/MURSHIDABAD: An attempt to convert a water body that is a haven for migratory birds in Murshidabad’s Bharatpur block into a site for makhana (fox nuts) cultivation has been foiled by the district administration, which took cognisance of complaints lodged by green action groups and cracked the whip. District magistrate Sharad Kumar Dwivedi wrote to the block development office and fisheries department, alerting them about the illegal takeover of Bikarul — also known as Saharpur Beel. He asked them to act promptly and ensure that the water body was restored. “When there is an alert from an individual or organisation about any threat to the environment, we always try to accord it top priority and address the issue at the earliest,” Dwivedi said. Saharpur Beel draws 6,000-10,000 birds every year. Human and Environment Alliance League (HEAL) and People United for Better Living in Cities (PUBLIC), the two green organisations that had taken up the cause are delighted with the administration’s response and said they would continue to ensure that the beel — a waterfowl habitat — was not usurped again. The green groups had sounded the alarm after they learnt that an attempt was being made to convert a wetland, where fish was farmed by villagers from Pollesri and Khoira, into a site for makhana cultivation.  Makhana has a number of serious consequences for both the environment and the livelihood of people. The plants blanket the water surface, depriving fishermen of their primary source of income. Since sunlight is blocked from penetrating the depths of the water, the level of dissolved oxygen drops and that drastically affects fish and all aquatic life. Cultivation of makhana also requires heavy use of insecticides, fertilisers and other agrochemicals. These affect the quality of water, making it unsuitable for any kind of human use or animal consumption. It reduces fish population too. “The consequences have been encountered and documented by Jadavpur University at various wetlands in Malda district from 2003 to 2005. Eventually, the fisheries department passed orders to stop makhana cultivation there,” said HEAL president Arka Sarkar. Though the threat appears to have been averted for now, with DM Dwivedi ordering removal of the makhana plants from the beel, Sarkar and Sovrajyoti Chatterjee of PUBLIC said they would continue to be vigilant and oppose similar attempts at other water bodies in the vicinity. “This is a disaster that we cannot allow to happen,” Chatterjee stressed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bharatpur-beel-a-bird-paradise-saved-from-makhana-monster/articleshow/87560630.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The services will resume on November 7. The trial run for the river cruise was conducted on Saturday. East Godavari district collector C Harikiran presided over a meeting with officials of water resources, tourism and police. Boat owners have been directed to follow government guidelines on safety. The Papikonda river cruise was stopped after the tragic boat accident in 2019 at Kachuluru, under Devipatnam mandal in East Godavari district, in which over 40 people were killed. Control rooms were set up in five places with water resources, tourism, police and revenue departments. A deputy collector will be posted at each control room as its manager to monitor the safety procedure. A pilot boat with a rescue team comprising of expert swimmers will guide three to five boats. An escort boat equipped with a satellite phone will follow the fleet. The police control room set up for boating should be informed after crossing every major point in the river. Only licensed pilots should operate the boats. Only nine private boats and two APTDC boats were permitted to ferry tourists. Boats will not be operated when the water discharge from Sir Arthur Cotton Barrage crosses three lakh cusecs. The boat organisers should sign an affidavit on safety measures. The boats should not be over loaded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/andhra-pradesh-tourist-boat-services-to-start-on-godavari-with-safety-checks/articleshow/87561876.cms||Samson Raj

Establishment of oxygen plants on the campus and Covid testing facilities and stoppage of non-Covid treatment during the peak of Covid are the other reasons cited by medical colleges while seeking a fee hike during a meeting held last week. While colleges claimed that they demanded a 30% hike, medical education director Dr PG Girish said the proposal seeks 20% increase. “The government has called a meeting on Monday to discuss it,” he told TOI. According to data from Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences, Karnataka has 8,900 undergraduate medical seats. The state government has control over 75% of these seats, which include government and private quota seats in private colleges. ‘No income since pandemic struck’K arnataka ment medical has colleges 19 govern , 27 - private colleges, four private universities and 10 deemedto-be universities. UG medical fee was last increased 25% in 2019. A student doing MBBS under the government quota in a private medical college pays Rs 1.4 lakh a year and Rs 59,850 in a government college. Managements said medical colleges were “nearly shut” for non-Covid admissions during the pandemic hurting their income, adding it’s difficult to run a college in such circumstances. They said that from 2021-22, all the seats will be allotted through all-India counselling and this is the last year colleges can negotiate with the government on fee revision. According to MR Jayaram, chairman, MS Ramaiah Medical College, and chairman of Karnataka Professional Colleges’ Foundation, all private medical colleges had been virtually handed over to the government in the past 18 months. “In our hospital, we handed 800 beds to the government for Covid treatment. No other treatment could be taken up in that period. Medical college hospitals are running without any income since the pandemic began. Many students have not paid full fee and are opting for installments,” said Jairam. The chief of another medical college said establishment of Covid testing facility and the mandatory setting up of oxygen plant at medical colleges to augment the supply and storage of medical oxygen for the patients hit them hard. “The state government has agreed to bear 70% of cost of oxygen plant construction, yet colleges have to spend a minimum Rs 1.3 crore,” said the head of a private medical college.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/private-medical-colleges-in-karnataka-cite-covid-losses-seek-20-fee-hike/articleshow/87561900.cms||Sunitha Rao R

With this, the state is free from most of Covid-19 restrictions and the nightlife in Karnataka is set to return after a seven-month gap. The decision follows recommendations made by the Karnataka Covid-19 technical advisory committee. Karnataka chief secretary P Ravikumar on Friday issued an order that, however, calls for continued vigilance in the border districts on the movement of people, especially from Kerala. “Only those persons who have taken both doses of the Covid vaccination should be allowed into the state,” the order said. The government has allowed horse races in the state with strict adherence to Covid-19 guidelines. Only double jabbed allowedThe order asks racecourse managements to allow only those who have been fully vaccinated within the premises. Races were stopped in March 2020 when Covid-19 hit the state. The government imposed night curfew on April 10 to curb the rising Covid cases at the beginning of the second wave. Initially, curfew was in force from 8pm to 6am, but it was gradually eased as fresh Covid cases began todip. The government came under pressure from hospitality and entertainment sectors as they were hit hard by the measure. “It is a welcome decision as it gives us two additional hours to do business,” said Ramanna, a manager of a bar and restaurant on New BEL Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/covid-19-karnataka-scraps-10pm-5am-curfew-keeps-strict-vigil-in-border-districts/articleshow/87561981.cms||---

Until Friday, night curfew was in place from 10pm to 5am, and currently Namma Metro operates trains from 6am to 10pm. Many passengers have urged BMRCL to run trains from 5am till midnight – just like pre-Covid times. “Now that curfew has been withdrawn, it does not make any sense to stop services at 10pm,” Aneesh Kumar, a techie, said. “At the moment, we are forced to depend on cabs and autorickshaws which charge high fares.” BMRCL has also not operated any additional services even during the festival rush. Chennai Metro Rail, for instance, operated trains from 5.30am to midnight on Tuesday and Wednesday (November 2 and 3) to facilitate people leaving the city for their hometowns to celebrate Deepavali. When contacted, a BMRCL official said they will soon take a decision on extending timings. No buses eitherSeveral daily commuters complained that there are insufficient BMTC services after 8pm. Ashwin J Kumar, a passenger said: “I take the BC7B series (8th Mile - Byadarahalli) buses but services dry up after 8pm. Many passengers in areas like Andrahalli are struggling. BMTC should resume BC7B and MF25 Metro feeder services. Even those having bus passes are forced to pay double charge by auto to travel to Andrahalli.” BMTC officials said they will look into the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-curfew-lifted-commuters-want-namma-metro-till-midnight/articleshow/87562022.cms||---

A statement from the Iraqi military said the attack targeted Kadhimi's residence in Baghdad's fortified Green Zone. It provided no further detail. Kadhimi's official Twitter account said the prime minister was safe and called for calm. Two government officials said Kadhimi's residence had been hit by at least one explosion and confirmed to Reuters that the prime minister was safe. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. Western diplomats based in the Green Zone, which houses government buildings and foreign embassies, said they heard explosions and gunfire in the area. Supporters of heavily armed groups aligned with Iran have in recent weeks staged demonstrations near the Green Zone protesting against the results of a general election last month which dealt a blow to their parliamentary power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/drone-attack-targets-iraq-pm-who-escapes-unhurt-iraq-military/articleshow/87562047.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Covid vaccination crawl makes 100% target an uphill drag||BHOPAL: It’s been a week since chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan ordered that at least 5-6 lakh vaccine doses be administered in the state every day, but the number of doses given out on any of these seven days hasn’t touched even 3 lakh. Between October 30 and November 5, the maximum daily count was 2.84 lakh on November 1. And between October 1 and November 5, 78.36 lakh vaccine doses were administered — an average of 2.17 lakh doses every day, not even half of what the CM prescribed. This is way below the average 5.71 lakh doses given per day in September, a month that ended with 1.7 crore vaccine doses. However, Covid vaccination has slowed down since then, with the festival season putting the brakes on vax. On November 5, only 4,972 doses were administered — the lowest in months. On October 31, the CM had spoken of the urgency for 100% vaccination, urging students to motivate their children to take the Covid vaccine. He said there would be door-to-door vaccination and asked officials to ensure that 5 to 6 lakh doses are administered daily and there’s no let-up during festivals. “If everyone gets fully vaccinated by December 31, we can be free from the third wave fear,” he said. As on November 5, 4.99 crore people in MP had been vaccinated, over 2.13 crore of them having got their second doses. This leaves 2.86 crore people to be vaccinated to ensure full vaccination. This averages to around 5.1 lakh doses per day. At the current pace, however, it looks like a target too far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-covid-vaccination-crawl-makes-100-target-an-uphill-drag/articleshow/87562063.cms||Amarjeet Singh
---||Bhopal||Come for offline class after Diwali, Madhya Pradesh schools tell kids; parents oppose||BHOPAL: Even without any notification by the state government several schools have begun asking students to attend offline classes, saying it will be a must after the Diwali vacation. The message began to be transmitted during online class in the run-up to Diwali, often in a not-too-subtle way. Parents say they have heard teachers of some schools tell children, even class 1 and 2 students, to “get ready to come to school after Diwali”. Some even said that there wouldn’t be any online class afterthe vacations. A few began sending consent forms afresh on the weekend. Parents have made it clear that they will not send children till there is no clarity on their vaccination. “This is not done. I have not heard about any government notification that offline classes are becoming mandatory. I am shocked after getting such a notification from the school,” said Shobhit Ahuja, father of a class 5 student. “I have not given consent to my child for offline class, but the school keeps asking him to ‘come to school’. Why should he go to school when I have said categorically no? This is not done. I am not going to send him at any cost,” said Seema Joshi, mother of a class 4 student. Most parents have made it clear that without vaccination, it is not safe to send children for offline classes, especially seeing how schools are shutting down again in other countries due to Covid surges. “There is no vaccination drive for children. How can we send them to school? This is a serious issue and schools cannot force us,” said Harshit Verma. Three months of reopening of schools, online is still the preferred choice of parents and children due to Covid-19 fears. Offline attendance is better in the higher classes, but primary and middle classes are struggling to get children to come to school. Schools say that offline classes can’t be successful until online classes are on. Schools in Madhya Pradesh were reopened in July, this year. Schools were reopened in different phases. As of now, all classes from 1 to 12 have been reopened. Government schools have far better attendance that private ones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/come-for-offline-class-after-diwali-madhya-pradesh-schools-tell-kids-parents-oppose/articleshow/87562112.cms||Ramendra Singh

---||Kochi||Kerala: CPM publicly censures former PWD minister G Sudhakaran||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: CPM state committee publicly censured former PWD minister and state committee member G Sudhakaran, who used to hold the rudder of the party in Alappuzha, for “not doing enough” to muster votes in favour of the party candidate in Ambalapuzha constituency, the seat represented by Sudhakaran thrice, during the assembly elections held earlier this year. Sudhakaran was censured, said a party communique issued after the state committee meeting at AKG Centre here on Saturday, for his alleged lapses in electioneering at Ambalapuzha constituency. “The state committee has found that Comrade G Sudhakaran's behaviour during the candidate selection and electioneering thereafter were not befitting that of a party state committee member. As part of the corrective measure, the state committee has decided to publicly censure Sudhakaran,” the party communique said. Sudhakaran had been facing severe criticism from party leaders in Alappuzha who accused him in party forums of “being inactive” during electioneering in Ambalapuzha, which was under his charge. Party candidate H Salam, who eventually won the seat, even complained that Sudhakaran did nothing to defend him when opponents tried to discredit him. Sudhakaran has been facing stiff resistance from fellow comrades ever since fisheries minister Saji Cherian emerged as a power centre in CPM in Alappuzha. However, Sudhakaran had tried to save his skin with the argument that there was no significant dip in votes polled in favour of Salam in pockets where he used to hold sway. In the state committee meeting too, Sudhakaran is learnt to have tried to defend his stand by brushing aside allegations against him. CPM has recently passed a resolution that called for attention against increasing parliamentary ambitions in party leaders. After the state committee meeting, Sudhakaran had a closed meeting with chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan at the latter's official residence. Sudhakaran refused to respond to the questions of journalists who accosted him when he came out after the meeting. Though what transpired between Pinarayi and Sudhakaran remains a secret, it is widely believed that Pinarayi who had benefited politically when Sudhakaran deserted the V S Achuthanandan camp in the Malappuram party conference in 2005, must have invited Sudhakaran to pacify him. Considering the gravity of charges levelled against him, many in the party feel that Sudhakaran ducked the sharper blade of discipline most probably due to the influence of Pinarayi. Viewed in chronological order, public censure is the third level of disciplinary action against a party member. In CPM, members who “stray” from the party principles are first warned, then censure, publicly censure, demotion, suspension and finally expulsion follow. An inquiry committee headed by CPM secretariat members Elamaram Kareem and K J Thomas had inquired into the allegations against Sudhakaran when the Alappuzha district committee found him guilty of being inactive during the poll campaign. The public censure was passed in the light of the inquiry committee report that found most of the allegations against Sudhakaran as factual.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-cpm-publicly-censures-former-pwd-minister-g-sudhakaran/articleshow/87562160.cms||---

Forest minister A K Saseendran has ordered an inquiry. In a letter to his Kerala counterpart Pinarayi Vijayan, Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin said, “On behalf of my government and the people of the southern districts of Tamil Nadu, I thank you and the government of Kerala for this permission. This would go a long way in benefiting the people of both states and I sincerely hope that this spirit of cooperation between our states continues”. A senior TN official said the permission for felling trees was granted by the deputy director of Periyar Tiger Reserve, based on the approval of chief wildlife warden of Kerala. “I have sought an emergency report from chief wildlife warden about the issue. When we get the report, then I will properly respond about the issue”, Saseendran told TOI. Water resources minister Roshy Augustine too seemed to be in the dark. He said he was trying to collect the details about the permission. “After I get the final details of the issue then I will respond “ Augustine said. "Deputy director of Periyar Tiger Reserve, based on the approval of chief wildlife warden of Kerala, granted permission to Tamil Nadu PWD on Saturday to remove the trees. It has been proven that land where the dam is located is part of the leased area given to Tamil Nadu and not reserve forests of Kerala. This understanding follows a bilateral talk through video conference between the two sides in September. Now, the PWD will strengthen the concrete packing of baby dam,” said a TN official. Former irrigation minister N K Premachandran flayed the decision of the Kerala government to allow Tamil Nadu to strengthen the baby dam at Mullaperiyar. ‘CM acted against state’s interest’Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has been maintaining a different stand on this right from the beginning and now with this decision his stand has become clear,” Premachandran said. “The chief minister has acted against the interest of the people of Kerala. With the government allowing TN to cut the trees to strengthen the baby dam we are providing all control over the dam to TN which will have serious consequences”, he added. Tamil Nadu water resources minister minister Duraimurugan who visited the dam on Friday had already made it clear that the water level will be increased to 152 feet. Tamil Nadu is also pushing for repairing about 5km long ghat approach road to the dam and raising a causeway. Kerala is yet to give its nod though. “The main dam is capable of holding the full reservoir level. Strengthening of Baby dam will pave the way for raising the permitted level,” said a TN official. The SC had in May 2014, ordered carrying out dam strengthening work to restore the water level to 152ft, the full reservoir level. The work includes strengthening the Baby dam like instrumentation, earthen bund, protecting the earth mound (the upstream side of island between main dam and Baby dam), protecting the upstream side of the island between main dam and spillway, and raising the upstream parapet wall from 158ft to 160ft for the main dam along the remaining length of 20m. Tamil Nadu sanctioned Rs 7.8 crore for this in 2015. Other work was completed but strengthening of Baby dam and earthen bund remain incomplete.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/mk-stalin-thanks-kerala-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-on-baby-dam-ak-saseendran-left-in-the-dark/articleshow/87562194.cms||---

The minister said the first dose of vaccination has covered 95% of the population and that 53% of the people have received both the shots. As much as 80% of the population would be fully vaccinated by January next year, Veena said. Experts also pointed out that there is no need to panic about the pandemic and that it is past its worst phase. “Though daily over six thousand cases are being reported on an average, the number of hospitalizations and ICU admissions have come down considerably. This shows that the people are not falling sick if at all they are being tested positive. More treatment facilities are also available now,” said Dr Anoop Kumar, chief of critical care medicine at Baby Memorial Hospital, Kozhikode. “Definitely, the panic situation is over and now what we need is a cautious approach. There are several positive aspects: Over 50% of the population has been fully vaccinated and several antiviral drugs have been tested successfully world over. The severity of the illness has also considerably come down, which itself is a good sign,” said Dr N Sulphi, president-elect of Indian Medical Association. “In several countries, the curative antiviral drugs have been tested successfully indicating that the pandemic is in its last leg. The only thing is that no new variant should cause another spread. Hence, it is not the time to show any kind of laxity in the caution,” said Dr A Althaf, associate professor, community medicine, Manjeri medical college. The minister said once the Centre approves vaccination for children, the state government is ready to begin the process. Already, the Indian Council of Medical Research has approved Bharat Biotech’s vaccine for children, she said, adding that the schools have been reopened adhering to all the Covid protocols. The first week of the school reopening has been a smooth affair but only when the children are covered with vaccination, we can be safer, she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/covid-situation-under-control-kerala-health-minister-veena-george/articleshow/87562224.cms||Rajiv G

At the time, Mukesh Gupta, the businessman, had gone to his shop and his family to a relative’s house to celebrate Bhai Duj. Mukesh’s friend and neighbour Rajiv told TOI that due to bank holiday, the timber merchant was unable to deposit the cash in the bank and had brought it to his house. Police said they had scanned the footage of CCTV cameras in the area but found no clue. “Mukesh left for his shop around 10am, while his wife and daughter left for Meerut around 11am to celebrate Bhai Duj. It must have been 12.30pm when Mukesh returned home and found his house ransacked. Around 12.45pm, he called me to inform me about the theft,” Rajiv said. “Banks are closed due to Diwali and Bhai Duj. So, he had brought cash from his shop to his house and was planning to deposit the same on Monday,” he added. Nipun Agarwal, SP (City 1), however, said that Mukesh was yet to assess the amount of money that had been stolen. “At this stage, we cannot comment on the amount which has gone missing as the family is still assessing the same,” he said. Police suspect the theft to be the handiwork of someone known to the family. “The thieves targeted only that room where the cash and jewellery were kept. It meant they knew in advance about the family’s movement and the crime was committed in less than half an hour, suggesting the involvement of an insider,” said Agarwal. While there’s no CCTV camera installed at the businessman’s house, police are scanning the footage of CCTV cameras in the neighbourhood. “Efforts are on to track down the criminals,” a police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/rs-1crore-in-cash-jewellery-stolen-from-ghaziabad-bizman-house/articleshow/87560528.cms||Abhijay Jha

There are 68 active cases now officially. Areas in urban villages such as Chhalera, Sadarpur, Surajpur and Nithari are among the top contributors to dengue cases. Private as well as government hospitals, however, said that the cases are still very high and new cases are coming in every day. Most private hospitals have run out of beds and are now using beds that were kept reserved for Covid patients. Most of these cases are not added to the district’s tally as all samples are not tested by the two government approved labs. Doctors also say that several cases of dengue and typhoid combination are being seen this year, especially in children. Meanwhile, the health department is continuing with its container survey to check stagnant water around residential areas. “We hope people continue to drain out fresh water and not keep stagnant water at home. Thermocol boxes are a special hazard and should be emptied. We are also receiving complaints of water in the basement of high-rise societies and are taking action along with the Authorities,” said Rajesh Sharma, district malaria officer. No new scrub typhus or Leptospirosis cases have been reported in Noida.

The vice-chancellor of the university Sabu Thomas has taken charge as the director of the centre. The university is learned to have made the decision based on a directive from the state government. Deepa P Mohanan, a research scholar, who has been on an indefinite hunger strike in the varsity, had demanded Kalarikkal’s removal from the department alleging that she faced discrimination based on caste from him and that he prevented her from doing her research. The action against the faculty member has been taken even as the hunger strike by the student entered the ninth day on Saturday. Meanwhile, Deepa said she will continue the hunger strike as she is firm on her demand to oust the professor from the centre. Thomas said that Kalarikkal has stepped down and that the decision was made after holding talks with Kalarikkal based on a directive from the government. "Kalarikkal is a brilliant faculty member. He was willing to step down," the vice chancellor said. He also said that nobody can remove Kalarikkal as a faculty member, adding that he will be continue to serve in the centre as well as in the Physics department. Kalarikkal had moved court on the allegations against him and the court had quashed all the cases against him, the VC said adding that the issue needs to be settled. Earlier in the day, minister for higher education R Bindu had signalled her support to the student. In a Facebook post the minister said that the government has asked the university what is stopping it from removing the professor and conduct a probe. She also said that the government is concerned about the research student’s health. She said that if there is a delay in the part of the university in removing the professor, the government will take the necessary steps. She also requested the student to withdraw from the strike by taking her words as an assurance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-mahatma-gandhi-university-removes-nano-centre-head-for-caste-bias/articleshow/87562256.cms||---

As part of the scale-up, GMDA will connect 428 underground tanks to the CIWMS, in addition to the 32 underground tanks connected to the system during a pilot run. The project is expected to cost Rs 16.69 crore. The pilot, which kicked off in June last year, involved 32 tanks in a 15km stretch from the water treatment plant (WTP) at Basai to Dundahera village. GMDA had spent Rs 1.88 crore on the pilot but officials said that it improved water supply monitoring and billing, as well as curtailed non-revenue water losses to only 20%. The data for earlier non-revenue water losses isn’t available. The scale-up, said GMDA officials, will include provisioning an electromagnetic flow meter, water control valve, level sensor, remote terminal unit and power supply at each of the underground tanks. In addition, a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system will help the Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) to monitor and control water levels, as well as collect and analyse data. With the CIWMS, GMDA can ensure that water is equitably distributed among the tanks from its remote, centralised office. The CIWMS will also allow GMDA to send out accurate water bills based on the exact quantity of water received by each consumer. The authority will be able to prevent leakage of water from tanks, as well as unauthorised access to water, helping to reduce non-revenue water losses. Lastly, officials can easily shut down connections if bills are unpaid. Consumers, on the other hand, can also get a more accurate reading of their water usage. “Gurgaon gets water from the Yamuna; the Yamuna water goes to the Basai and Chandu Budhera water treatment plants, where it gets converted into drinking water. Then through pipelines, it goes all across Gurgaon. The aim is to use technology to improve the distribution, monitoring, and control of this water,” said a senior GMDA official, who did not want to be named. The tanks GMDA is targeting are located along various pipelines of sub city I and II of the GMDA. “Tenders are in place as are the rates since we have already run a pilot. Now, we are only scaling up the project. However, we have sought public opinion on the project and allotted two weeks for the same. We expect to have feedback some time in November and based on that, the project will be scaled up,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/less-leakage-accurate-water-bills-gmda-to-use-tech-to-monitor-tanks/articleshow/87560585.cms||Sakshi Dayal

In both Noida and Ghaziabad, there was a complete ban on the sale and use of firecrackers. Police said they relied on local inputs and complaints lodged on Dial 112 to make the arrests. But they agreed that surveillance was difficult — in many cases, the bursting of crackers had stopped by the time the cops reached. The result of the widespread cracker ban flout, combined with instances of stubble burning and meteorological factors was evident in the quality of air on Diwali evening and the day after. On both days, AQI was in the “severe” category. In Noida city, the most number of arrests was made in Sector 24 police station area. A total of nine cases were lodged there and 14 persons were arrested. It was followed by Sector 39, where seven cases were lodged. Sector 58 had six cases registered. In the central Noida zone, a total of 48 cases were lodged and 55 people arrested. The most number of cases in this zone were registered in Bisrakh and Phase 3 police station areas, which saw 11 cases each. Surajpur saw 10 cases. In Greater Noida zone, a total of 36 cases were lodged and 47 people arrested. At 8, Jewar police station area had the most number of cases followed by six each in Jarcha and Rabupura, five in Dadri and four in Kasna. There were three cases of cracker ban violation each in Ecotech I and Dankaur areas. Anita Chauhan, the SHO of Bisrakh police station, said most of the cases were lodged after inputs from local cops who were patrolling. A senior police officer agreed it was difficult to trace the flood of complaints lodged on Dial 112. “If people complained about a particular society or a spot, the bursting of crackers would stop by the time the police reached. They are not for long durations. That is why it is difficult to attend to such calls,” the officer said. Many officers said they received complaints also on their phones. “There is a technical challenge that police face in such cases. Those who called up on cellphones were told clearly that attending to their complaints was not possible,” said one of the SHOs. Most of the people who were arrested were booked under IPC sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (whoever unlawfully or negligently does any act likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life), 270 (whoever malignantly does any act likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life) and provisions of the Environment Protection Act. Additional DCP (Noida) Ranvijay Singh said the ban violators were granted bail a few hours later. “In such cases, an FIR is lodged, but since no remand is made through the court, the accused are given bail at the police station itself. A notice is issued to them,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/cracker-crackdown-141-held-114-cases-filed-in-noida-on-diwali/articleshow/87560600.cms||Shikha Salaria

Deputy commissioner Yash Garg said that if a farmer or an agricultural worker becomes a victim of an accident while returning from fields, villages, market yards, and such places during agricultural work, they will get financial assistance under the welfare scheme aimed at providing livelihood support to the families of the farming communities. “Farmers and agricultural labourers have to work day and night in the fields and they are prone to various kinds of accidents. The Chief Minister Kisan and Khetihar Jeevan Suraksha Yojana is to ensure livelihood support for such distressed families. And we need to ensure that no eligible beneficiary is left behind in Gurgaon,” said Garg. Under the scheme, an assistance of Rs 5 lakh is given in case of accidental death, Rs 2.5 lakh in case of spinal fracture or permanent disability, Rs 1.87 lakh in case of fracture of two limbs or permanent serious injury. Similarly, in case of fracture of a limb or permanent injury, an amount of Rs.1.25 lakh will be given. For complete amputation, Rs 75,000 has been earmarked and Rs 37,000 for partial fracture of finger. “The scheme provides assistance of Rs 5 lakh in case of accidental death. The scheme also covers various other injuries that leave a person incapable of working and earning a livelihood. In case of death, it is necessary to have a police report and post-mortem report to claim financial assistance. In case of any disability, a certificate and photo proof should be submitted along with the claim,” the DC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/farmers-to-get-cover-for-accidents-during-work/articleshow/87560623.cms||---

While state elections are seen to be dominated by disparate factors, discussion on issues like price rise, inner-party cohesion, and the continued protests by farmers unions in Punjab, Haryana and west UP against the new agri-marketing laws has been on within BJP. The results of the Ellanabad assembly polls in Haryana have been encouraging as farm unions had targetted BJP but the party managed to increase its vote share even as it came second. But the larger issue of the farmers’ stir that has been on since last November remains with some in BJP holding the view that confrontation be avoided despite provocations by aggressive protestors. The day-long meeting will physically host only national officebearers and ministers, whereas state-level officials will attend remotely through video conferencing. “The meeting will begin with the address of party president Jagat Prakash Nadda. Various issues, including a special brainstorming session on the forthcoming assembly elections in five states, will be discussed,” Rajya Sabha MP and party’s general secretary Arun Singh said at a press meet. PM Modi will deliver the closing speech of the conference that is expected to touch on current issues and will be seen as political guidance to the party. Singh said the meeting will discuss programmes and policies to make the party more broadbased in order to incorporate larger sections of the society. The party will also come out with its political resolution. Former law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has been involved in drafting the resolution. Former party presidents Rajnath Singh, Amit Shah, Nitin Gadkari will also be present. Others to attend include, BJP leader in Rajya Sabha and commerce minister Piyush Goyal and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, besides all Union ministers who are part of the BJP national executive. Singh said in view of the Covid-19 protocols, all national executive members have not been called to Delhi. A total of 124 leaders will be present at the meeting. All the CMs and deputy CMs of BJP ruled states, all BJP state unit presidents and other senior leaders from the states who are part of the national executive will virtually attend the meeting from their respective state headquarters.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: NGT Panel finds Ameenpur nalas encroached||HYDERABAD: The joint committee, appointed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), has confirmed encroachments at Ameenpur nalas leading to flooding of nearby colonies during the rains. The joint committee has also recommended immediate cancellation of construction permission granted to Lalitha Constructions and others. The joint committee of Sangareddy district collector, senior irrigation officials and lake protection committee representatives said: “Encroachments and constructions are observed in the floodwater stream and its buffer area duly diverting the surplus course by dumping the soils and also reducing the width of the surplus course. It led to partial blocking of the flow of water.” The committee also said construction of houses was taken up on surplus stream and buffer zone. “It is observed that Lalita Constructions has built a club house in the alignment of surplus channel and buffer zone. An individual, Vemulawada Kumara Swamy, has constructed three individual residential buildings which are partly affecting the surplus channel and buffer zone,” it pointed out. During the rains, nearby colonies were inundated due to obstructions created in the natural water path because of dumping of soil and construction activity, the committee explained. The National Green Tribunal appointed the joint committee on August 27 this year to inspect the nala and file a report after Human Rights and Consumer Protection Cell Trust and Krishna Brundavan Association filed a plea against Lalitha Constructions in the NGT southern zone. They challenged the technical approval given to Lalitha Constructions for construction of five towers and blocks allegedly on floodwater canals on the outlet nala of Kothacheruvu tank and inlet nala of Bandam Kommu tank of Ameenpur. The petitioners alleged that the builder damaged the natural flood canals and made deep excavations for constructing the towers, which led to flooding of adjacent colonies and caused damage to other private properties. The petitioners demanded cancellation of HMDA’s technical approval given to Lalitha Constructions and restore all floodwater nalas and to demolish the illegal constructions in the FTL and buffer zone. “The respondent has got the building permission from Ameenpur gram panchayat. We have informed the district panchayat officer to take action for cancellation of the permissions,” said the joint committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyderabad-ngt-panel-finds-ameenpur-nalas-encroached/articleshow/87562345.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The air quality, however, improved slightly due to higher wind speed and is expected to further flush out pollutants from Sunday onwards, weather experts said. According to Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB), the city’s air quality index (AQI) stood at 456 on Saturday. Due to rampant bursting of crackers on Diwali on Thursday despite restrictions, coupled with a rise in incidents of stubble burning, the city’s AQI had slipped to the ‘severe’ category to reach 472 on Friday. An AQI between 401 and 500 is considered ‘severe’. On Saturday, Vikas Sadan, Sector 51 and Teri Gram air monitoring stations recorded AQIs at 492, 499 and 419, respectively. Statistics for the Gwal Pahari centre was not available because of insufficient data. The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), however, predicted that the pollutants would clear out of the city’s air as wind speed had picked up since Saturday evening. On Saturday, the average speed was recorded at six kilometres per hour (km/hr), up from the three km/hr a day ago. Besides calm winds, unfavourable weather conditions like low temperature and low mixing height had also degraded the city’s air quality over the last few days, experts said. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), Gurgaon’s minimum temperature was recorded at 16 degrees Celsius and maximum at 26.2 degrees on Saturday. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy at CSE, meanwhile, told TOI that stubble burning had also added to Gurgaon’s air pollution. “We do not have any mechanism in place to check the contribution of stubble burning share in Gurgaon’s air quality at the moment, but of course it is affecting the district’s AQI as we have data that it is clearly impacting Delhi’s air,” Roychowdhury said. The civic authorities, meanwhile, said they have upped pollution mitigation measures by sprinkling water on roads and continuing night patrolling. “We have urged corporates and RWAs to start sprinkling water across Gurgaon,” Kuldeep Singh, HSPCB regional officer, said. Delhi’s air quality may see an improvement, too, with IMD forecasting strong surface winds at 20-30 kmph on Sunday. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), a pollution monitoring body under the Union ministry of earth sciences, said, “Delhi’s AQI is likely to improve to upper end of ‘very poor’ category as surface winds are becoming stronger, dispersing air pollutants. Strong north-westerly winds enhance transport of emissions from stubble burning. Share of crop residue burning emissions in PM2.5 is 41% (Effective fire count 5,159).” The CPCB’s central control room data showed that Delhi-NCR's average 24-hour PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations were 429 micrograms per cubic metre and 298 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively, at 7pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gurgaons-pollution-level-severe-for-the-second-day-in-a-row/articleshow/87560787.cms||Ipsita Pati

The house at No. 131 Luz Church Road was redone only from the inside to make it a more fluid space, but the mango tree in the backyard, which is as old as the house, was untouched. “It was at the metaphorical centre of all the celebrations in the family, and now, we have created a courtyard around it, so it has become the architectural centerpiece of the space,” she says. “We want people to see it as an extension of their home.” Primrose 131, which opened in July, is just the latest of several sprawling old bungalows in the city that are being turned into contemporary event spaces by the families that own them — to host everything from art exhibitions and organic food fairs to classical concerts, band nights and stand-up comedy evenings. The Chettiar Bungalow, which belongs to the AVM family, opened its doors to the public in 2018, and has since become one of the more popular venues in the city, having hosted more than 80 events so far. Who wouldn’t want to get married, after all, in a bungalow that is a favourite in the Kollywood film and television industry for song sequences and more recently, as J Jayalalithaa’s home in the movie ‘Thalaivi’ and in the web series ‘Queen’. The bungalow, which belonged to film mogul A V Meiyappa Chettiar, was built in 1965, and had waterfalls, fountains, a small bridge and a ‘Japan cottage’, all of which are retained. “It was a rather hightech house for those times,” says Bhuvana Bharti, the third-generation member of the family who looks after the bungalow now. “There was a bed that would descend at the press of a button for instance. My grandfather hosted a lot of dinners here for actor Amitabh Bachchan, the late director Raj Kapoor, and former CM, the late M Karunanidhi.” The first film that was shot here was K Balachander’s ‘Apoorva Ragangal’ in 1975. Perhaps the oldest among the bungalow spaces is Luz House, a more than 250-year-old Dutch building that belonged to Moddaverapu Dera Venkataswami Naidu, dubash to Parry & Co in the 19th century. He became wealthy from his business dealings as primary translator for the British, and acquired 20 acres in Luz, on which Luz House already existed, and served as the barracks for the Portuguese armed forces from whom Naidu had purchased the property. It was home to Venkata Mahipathi Naidu, more famously known as Buchi Babu (the father of South Indian Cricket), who was born here in 1868. “We renovated the place without breaking any walls,” says Abhimanyu Prakash, a seventh-generation member of the Buchi Babu family. The original teak wood has been retained and the walls are renovated with lime and mud mortar. “Various generations of the family have renovated parts of the house. For instance, the front of the house is 150 years old, the roof, 80 years old. But we kept it all intact,” says Abhimanyu. Since its opening in 2015, the 8,000 square foot house, which was incidentally the zenana, or ladies’ quarters of yore, has hosted about 10 events a month. “We are seeing a renewed interest in people wanting to renovate their old bungalows, which is encouraging,” says architect Tahaer Zoyab, who is also part of Madras Inherited, a citybased group that celebrates heritage through walks and talks. “These heritage buildings are built to last, and by conserving and restoring them, there will be so much more history to celebrate in the years to come. It’s a winwin-win for the building, for architecture and for the city.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/my-house-your-space/articleshow/87562319.cms||Kamini Mathai
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Key from abroad used to loot Rs 50 lakh from ATMs, 4 nabbed||HYDERABAD: Four persons allegedly involved in stealing nearly Rs 50 lakh cash from ATMs by making the machine malfunction temporarily were arrested by Mancherial police on Saturday. Mancherial police said the accused— Robin Khan, Sahib, Harish, all three from Nuh district, and Ejaj Ahmed Khan, a resident of Palwal — were from Haryana. They were in possession of 30 ATM cards and Rs 2.70 lakh cash was seized from them. They formed a gang and took flights to different places to commit ATM heists. The accused reportedly bought a key from abroad. Using this key, they could open the upper part of an ATM machine. “Using an ATM card, they will make a transaction to withdraw money. When the machine makes the sound of counting notes, before the cash is dispensed, the accused turn off the machine,” Mancherial assistant commissioner of police Akhil Mahajan told TOI. Later, they would call the customer care and lodge a complaint informing that money was not dispensed from the machine. Despite the machine suddenly turning off, the machine would either dispense the cash or allow anyone to insert their fingers into the dispensing slot to pull the cash out. “This slot is there only in some models of ATMs of a particular public sector bank. The accused came to know about it and started committing offences,” the officer said. Before committing two offences on two different dates in Mancherial, the accused were in Chennai, Jaipur and other places and allegedly committed similar offences. The fraud came to light after a bank official lodged a police complaint informing about mismatch in ATM cash. Following this, police deployed personnel at different ATM centres. The four accused went to an ATM where two went inside while the other two were standing outside and telling customers that the machine was not working. On suspicion, a police team went inside and found the ATM machine open. All four were immediately arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-key-from-abroad-used-to-loot-rs-50-lakh-from-atms-4-nabbed/articleshow/87562431.cms||---

---||Gurgaon||‘Emergency’: Group wants strict steps to control dust||Gurgaon: Expressing concern over the deteriorating air quality, a city-based residents’ group, Citizen for Clean Air (CFCA), has written to deputy commissioner Yash Garg, seeking immediate enforcement of all smoke and dust containment measures in the city. Members of the organisation claimed there was a “health emergency” as the concentration of particulate matter recorded by all four air monitoring stations in the city had touched 1,000ug/m3. This, the letter states, was equivalent to inhaling huge grams of toxic and acrid smoke with every breath. The elderly and children with breathing problems were worst affected, it said. Following the rampant bursting of firecrackers on Diwali night despite restrictions, coupled with a rise in incidents of stubble burning, the city’s AQI had slipped to 472 and 456, which is ‘severe’ category, on Friday and Saturday. Ruchika Sethi Takkar, the founder of CFCA, said, “PM2.5 released by crackers was fatal as it is a noxious mix of heavy metals. And given the unfavourable meteorological conditions, including lower wind speed, dust, prevailing smog conditions due to stubble and waste burning, the pollution levels have increased manifold. We have sought swift actions to prevent further deterioration of air quality in Gurgaon and Manesar by ensuring 100% compliance to all the dust control measures and zero episodes of waste burning.” An intensive sprinkling of water on roads, strict adherence to NGT construction guidelines, an aerial wash of trees and foliage and strict monitoring and regulation of the open sale of construction material are among the mitigation measures sought by the group, environment engineer and CFCA member Abhishek Srivastava said. Meanwhile, a senior HSPCB official said they have intensified pollution control measures. “We are working at a war footing level and have implemented the pollution curb measures on the ground from October 1 itself,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/emergency-group-wants-strict-steps-to-control-dust/articleshow/87560799.cms||Akanksha Gupta
---||Gurgaon||What’s on SPR’s central verge? Eateries and cows||Gurgaon: Residents of the new sectors along Southern Peripheral Road (SPR) have expressed concern over the lack of maintenance and encroachment of the central verge and green belts in the area. Green belts are being occupied by unauthorised street vendors, shops and eateries and stray cattle are damaging plants, they alleged. According to the residents, after several efforts, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) planted saplings on the central verge of SPR this monsoon. But it didn’t ensure regular watering and fencing to ensure the survival of the saplings, they said. “The metropolitan authority carried out a plantation drive on the central verge between SPR and Tulip Chowk towards Kehar Singh Chowk a few months back. In the absence of regular watering and maintenance, the plants are now withering,” Capt RK Yadav (retd), the president of Tulip Violet RWA, said. “With the increasing pollution in the city, there is not only a need to increase greenery but also to maintain them so that planted saplings survive and grow. Otherwise, the whole exercise goes to waste. Stray cows can often be seen around Tulip Chowk, which have destroyed the plantation done by GMDA and also marred the aesthetics of the area.” he added. The residents also alleged that nurseries, makeshift shops and eateries are flourishing on green belts along the master road between sectors 69, 70 and 70A. Ajay Sharma, vice-president of Tulip Ivory RWA, said: “Our area has been neglected for a very long time. The authorities need to urgently address our concerns regarding sanitation, encroachment, security and civic infrastructure. Local vendors from nearby villages have encroached upon green belts and are creating a huge nuisance, which poses a security threat to residents as well.” Meanwhile, a senior GMDA official said they have received complaints from residents and are already working towards fencing the central verge. “We conducted a plantation drive in the monsoon and are already working towards its fencing and linking the area with a sewage treatment plant to ensure that the saplings are watered regularly. I have recently conducted a site inspection and the issue will be resolved soon. While we are taking regular action against encroachment of green belts, there is a need to formulate a policy to tackle this problem,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/whats-on-sprs-central-verge-eateries-and-cows/articleshow/87560825.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chandigarh||Push Punjab, Haryana to declare Sukhna ESZ soon, Chandigarh administration tells Centre again||CHANDIGARH: While the ministry of environment, forest and climate change is pursuing the matter to expedite the process to notify ecosensitive zone (ESZ) around Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary for the area falling in Punjab and Haryana, the Chandigarh administration has taken up the matter with the Centre for its early declaration by the two states. Sources said the UT officials during a recent visit to Delhi had taken up the matter once again. In 2017, the administration had notified to leave a 2-to-2.75-kilometre radius from the sanctuary as ESZ.UT chief conservator of forests Debendra Dalai, in a recent letter to the ministry, had stated, “It was requested to expedite the notification for ESZ for the area falling in the states of Punjab and Haryana, which is yet to be notified”. The UT had also reiterated that 90% area of sanctuary falls in Punjab and Haryana, therefore to protect the entire sanctuary, it is very much important to notify ESZ for the area immediately. In response to the UT’s letter, the ministry had stated that they are pursuing the matter with Punjab and Haryana. Recently, UT adviser Dharam Pal had directed the forest and wildlife department officials to take up the matter afresh with the government. Last year also, in a meeting convened by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change, wildlife division, to discuss the issues related with forest and wildlife management being undertaken in the state governments and union territories, the UT had submitted for declaring ESZ at the earliest. The ministry has issued final notification on ESZ around the sanctuary for Chandigarh alone while Punjab and Haryana till date have not declared such zones in their respective territories. The UT is pushing that Punjab and Haryana should also follow in its footsteps. The administration in the past had also urged the two states to regulate human activities in the catchment area as the Supreme Court had also upheld that huge construction could not be allowed close to the sanctuary. In December 2019, the UT had urged the ministry to expedite the process of ESZ. Haryana had planned 1km Sukhna ESZ Haryana recently had also planned areas ranging from 1 to 1.5 km as ESZ and had also sought comments from the department concerned. Besides, the UT has already opposed Punjab government’s proposal to declare only a 100m ESZ on its side.On January 25, 2017, the Union ministry had issued the ESZ notification for Chandigarh. On September 17, 2015, the ministry had issued the draft notification only for the sanctuary area that fell under UT and not for the section that came under Punjab and Haryana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/push-punjab-haryana-to-declare-sukhna-esz-soon-chandigarh-administration-tells-centre-again/articleshow/87562421.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Chennai||New cheese on the block||It was a deep desire to write a book on food that made Shalini Padmanabhan delve into vegan cuisine. Once she realised that a lot of people are looking for dairy substitutes, she began experimenting with vegan cheese and butter. And finally, chanced upon the recipe of one that’s been gaining popularity with people choosing plant-based diets – potato cheese. “I was working on a nachos cheese sauce and went online for inspiration. That’s when I got to know about potato cheese and decided to give it a try,” says Shalini, who in 2020 launched The Veganator, which offers a variety of breads, cheese, crackers and cookies free of dairy, gluten and white sugar. Made of boiled potato, olive oil, tapioca starch, nutritional yeast and a dash of lemon juice, her potato cheese is popular with children as well. “It’s easy to make and takes just about an hour. It can be had plain, on a cracker, in a sandwich and even on pizza,” says Shalini. The vegan community is always on the lookout for dairy substitutes. So far, soy, almond and oat milk have been popular, but now, the humble potato has emerged as a hot favourite with people developing a taste for milk and cheese derived from it. Swedish company Veg of Lund launched potato milk under the brand DUG. According to the brand, it is more sustainable, as its production requires “half as much land as oat milk, and 56 times less land than almond milk.” Commercially, potato milk is made by boiling potatoes, and then emulsifying them with rapeseed oil and other foods for calcium, pea proteins and chicory fibre. It is then fortified industrially with different vitamins and minerals. While potato milk is not sold in India, DIY recipes are available online. Potato cheese, on the other hand, is sold by a few brands and is popular with adults and kids alike. “I was always a vegetarian but a few years ago, I developed intolerance to lactose and gluten. So, while looking for substitutes online, I came across a recipe for potato milk that needs only boiled potatoes, almonds, honey, vanilla extract and a pinch of salt. You just blend and strain it,” says Puducherry-based Anandhapriya Shanmugham. In Bengaluru, Millie Mitra, who makes vegan cheeses, has been making potato cheese for the last seven years but purely for her own consumption. “I discovered it in South Africa, and have been making it ever since. It’s a good option for those who are looking for non-nut vegan cheeses,” says Millie, who makes this variant by seasoning boiled or steamed potatoes with apple cider vinegar, salt, and pepper. “It really works well for a mac n cheese recipe; it has a sticky gooeyness and swirls around the pasta very well,” she says. Nutritionist Shiny Surendran says potato cheese is a good choice for vegans and people who are lactose intolerant. “Potato cheese is loaded with carbs, so it will be good for physically active people, such as children who are into sports, or someone who is training for a marathon. It contains potassium and B complex,” she says. Meenakshi Bajaj, dietician, Tamil Nadu Government Multi Super Specialty Hospital, says homemade potato milk may lack flavour and, since it is not fortified with vitamins, may lack nutritional value too. Nutritionally, potatoes are low in sodium, high in potassium and glycaemic index. “100g of boiled potato consists of 77 cal and 1.7g protein. Though low in saturated fat, it will raise triglycerides when consumed regularly and in large quantities. It is also inadequate in protein though moderate amounts of phytonutrients will satisfy the palate for those looking for vegan alternatives of protein,” she says, adding that though potatoes contain vitamin C, it’s lost during cooking. “It is useful for lactose intolerant people and those allergic to nuts, gluten, milk alternates and those with malabsorption.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/new-cheese-on-the-block/articleshow/87562435.cms||Priya Menon
---||Gurgaon||Manesar murders: Attack footage in house, say cops||Gurgaon: Police have formed four teams to trace the accused who barged into the house of a former sarpanch in a Manesar village on Diwali night and fired indiscriminately at his family and relatives performing Lakshmi puja, killing both his sons. No arrest had been made till late on Saturday evening. Police officers scanning CCTV footage from cameras installed both inside the house as well as in nearby buildings in Kasna village said they had got some crucial leads that could help them trace the accused. Around 8pm on Thursday, three men had barged into the house of Gopal, the former sarpanch, in Kasan village and rained bullets into his family members engaged in Diwali prayers. While Gopal’s two sons died, four of his relatives, including an eight-year-old, suffered injuries. A family member said the firing continued for 15 minutes. Preliminary investigation revealed that the attack on Gopal’s house was the fallout of a murder of a villager that dates back to 2007. The two families have since been engaged in a bitter battle. Gopal’s sons, Balram and Sohanpal, had been handed the life term in connection with the murder then. They came out on bail a few years ago and the other family was since looking for an opportunity to avenge the 2007 death. “Balram and Sohanpal had shot dead one Manoj in 2007. After they came out on bail, Manoj’s brother Yogender was looking for an opportunity to take revenge. On Thursday evening, when all the family members were busy performing puja, Yogender and his associates barged into the house and fired indiscriminately at them,” said ACP (crime) Preet Pal Sangwan. Sangwan said the entire attack was captured in cameras installed inside the compound of the house as well as in other buildings. Since the family members could not immediately recollect the password, it took long to retrieve the footage, he added. According to the senior police officer, some of the attackers were wearing masks and could not be identified, but four of them used to be visitors to the house several years ago. “We are also scanning call records of the accused and checking CCTV footage from different locations. Our teams are following some crucial leads and we hope to make arrests soon,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/manesar-murders-attack-footage-in-house-say-cops/articleshow/87560839.cms||---

No one was injured in the accident. Informed of the incident by police, fire and rescue services officials arrived and chopped off the tree branches. All the debris was later removed. At least eight two-wheelers involved in road accidents were parked at the spot and were damaged. A portion of the building, used by the Pondy Bazaar traffic investigation wing that was recently shifted to the Ashok Nagar station, was also damaged. The tree fell towards the left where some barricades were placed. Had it fallen to right on GN Chetty Road, the damage could have been considerable as three major showrooms are located there, said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-vehicles-damaged-as-30-year-old-tree-falls-in-pondy-bazaar-none-injured/articleshow/87562478.cms||---
---||Chennai||403 Amma Unavagams serve recipe for trouble||Shrinking footfalls, excess staff and increased corruption in procurement and use of groceries and vegetables have put a question mark on the viability of the 403 Amma Unavagams run by Greater Chennai Corporation, the dream project of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa.Since a DMK-led government took over in May, drastic steps including asking staff to compulsorily take five days off every month to saveRs1 crore every month and imposing penalties wherever corruption is unearthed have been taken. Staff at these outlets had been doubled in the past few years, with some having more than 15-20 employees. Now, there is at least one employee for about 20 customers. Daily footfalls have fallen from 1,000-2,000 in pre-Covid times to 120-500. “In some Amma Unavagams, the footfalls are as low as 40-50 but there are 15-20 as in the case of outlets at Saidapet and Royapettah. We will not sack any employees and will not reduce the quantity of food or close any outlets. But we cannot be overstaffed. Per day wages areRs300 per person,” said an official. The civic body, which in 2020-21 spentRs102 crore on Amma Unavagams including Rs 50 crore on salaries,Rs46 crore on groceries and vegetables andRs6 crore on repairs, managed justRs15.5 crore in sales. “We have asked employees to increase sales. Until then, they will be asked to take leave five days a month. We are also bringing in the register system to enter every item used for food preparation and will compare with sales and leftovers. We are aware that 1kg atta can help make 40 chapattis. This way, whenever we find any kind of irregularities, we will penalise the self-help group members for it,” said an official. An employee at an outlet at Saidapet said the customer base had fallen from 500 to 120. The one at BRN Garden in Broadway is deserted, with not a single customer walking in for more than a month. “Even drunk men don’t come,” said a worker. At Royapettah, footfalls have shrunk from 1,500 to a mere 150. But, a corporation official said, the expenses remained the same. “In places like Perungudi, where only 50 customers walk in, there are 19 employees. With no one monitoring procurement and sales, irregularities are taking place.” Another official said the corporation would continue to run the outlets. “But we need a better system in place.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/403-amma-unavagams-serve-recipe-for-trouble/articleshow/87562480.cms||Komal Gautham
---||Gurgaon||Fitness in pandemic: How indoor turned outdoor for running and riding groups||Gurgaon: At their harshest, lockdowns the world over prevented people from stepping out for even basic exercise, which was confined to the four walls of their homes. For the riders, runners and walkers of Gurgaon, the challenge was to stay fit and active as safely as was possible. So, when Covid upended the rituals and rhythms of life, the indoors became their outdoors. “The first question that came to our mind was — what can we do, and how do we maintain our fitness?” recalls Siddarth Choudhary of those days back in the first half of 2020. The founder of Gurgaon Road Runners (GRR), Choudhary believed then that it was impossible to keep to a fitness regime until one had hit the road or track. But while life may have thrown the GRR family a curveball, they were more than ready to intercept it. And Choudhary, ever the optimist, saw the glass as half full. “Since I was leading a group, I thought, let’s work on body-fat optimisation because we can’t go outdoors to run. And how you do that is by controlling your diet, so I started working on a lot of diet plans,” he said. Alongside monitoring nutrition, members focused on high-intensity interval training like push-ups and squats. “There were many things we could do, to work around the fact that we were indoors, and we managed it beautifully — in fact, people were able to get into their best shape,” Choudhary reveals, happily adding that even he has never felt better. But it wasn’t just about sticking to an activity that had become a pleasant distraction over the years. It was also about providing moral support to friends and their families who were struck down by the virus. This was what the folks at Let’s Walk Gurgaon (LWG) sought to do when the outdoors became off limits. “At the end of the day, we are a community, and there is that bonding amongst ourselves. In those days, we knew families who were affected by Covid and we were in touch with them,” shared Arvind Dimri, a long-time and loyal LWG man. “There were some of us who were living alone, and in fact one of our members did get the virus. She was quite serious but we were able to take her to hospital and get her admitted.” Dimri also figured that senior citizens and people living alone would need extra assistance during the lockdown. Therefore, when chemists were being overwhelmed with requests for medicines, he and his fellow cyclists chipped in by volunteering to deliver to their homes whatever was urgently required. Fighting the itch Yet, there was always the yearning to put on your running or walking shoes, to take that bike out. “Because of the pandemic, we weren’t allowed out of the house, we weren’t allowed to go for walks, forget about cycling,” remembers Ela Ghose, a member of SpinLife, a Delhi-NCR collective of cyclists. Suddenly, one piece of equipment became something of a necessity. “What a lot of us did was get a bike trainer, a gadget on which you can mount your bike and ride indoors,” Ghose explains. “The more sophisticated ones actually allow you to ride routes all over the world, with resistance automatically increasing on your bike as you ‘climb’ a hill. There’s also a very popular indoor training programme called Zwift, and a lot of us started ‘zwifting’ together. These are virtual group rides where people would work out together from their own homes.” The upshot was that from a place of domestic comfort, the outdoorsy made the most of the downtime. “Everybody who wanted to get fitter loved the plans,” shares Choudhary. “In fact, now when I tell people to do on-ground training, they say, ‘When we are getting 99% of the same result, we would prefer to continue doing it online, and to have live virtual sessions.” Many SpinLifers are now in magnificent physical fettle. “People actually improved their fitness dramatically in that time — though I wasn’t one of those!” admits Ghose. “They did amazingly well and got stronger. And when they finally could return to the road, they were turbo-charged!” Getting back, step by step In August, the Gurgaon Road Runners resumed outdoor activities, all the while observing government safety regulations, ensuring social distancing is being followed and conducting thermal checks in bigger gatherings. Masks are off when running but back on when the group is together for, say, a stretching session. At present, GRR is organising virtual runs but it will be a while before the marathons, the events the group is known for, are held. “We have waited for 18 months and can wait a few months more. Let things settle down properly,” reasons Choudhary. As for LWG regulars, they have been congregating at 5am on Saturdays since September at a predetermined location, but with one precondition: only fully vaccinated members can join in. “The precaution we take is to ensure that everybody is keeping to all hygiene protocols,” Dimri stresses. As a habit, many cyclists sport bandanas, which would double as masks. And Ajeet Pandey of Pedalyatri, a popular NCR group for devoted pedallers, feels that cycling is the safest outdoor activity for it lends itself best to the practice of physical distancing. “On trails, it is very easy to follow the protocols because even when riding in groups it is possible to maintain distance,” he claims. It has certainly been a learning experience, if also a chastening one, from which plenty of positives can be gleaned. Dimri is not taking things lightly but is feeling relaxed about the here and now. And he speaks for others in the city for whom physical welfare equates to mental wellbeing. They now know that indoors is just as good as outdoors for staying fit and healthy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/fitness-in-pandemic-how-indoor-turned-outdoor-for-running-and-riding-groups/articleshow/87560886.cms||Sharad Kohli

The city recorded an AQI of 466 even as the overall air quality showed a slight improvement from Friday when the district recorded an AQI of 470. Ghaziabad’s AQI has been in the ‘severe’ category since Thursday when people celebrated Diwali by bursting crackers. All four pollution monitoring stations in Ghaziabad recorded AQI in the 'severe' category. Loni recorded the highest AQI of 468 followed by Indirapuram with an AQI of 458. Sanjay Nagar and Vasundhara recorded AQIs of 453 and 452, respectively. Noida recorded an AQI of 461 on Saturday, down from 475 the previous day. However, the AQI is still in the 'severe' category. Of the four monitoring stations in Noida, Sector 125 recorded the highest AQI of 464 followed by Sector 116 with an AQI of 463. Sectors 1 and 62 recorded AQIs of 452 and 442, respectively. Greater Noida on Saturday recorded an AQI of 414 with the pollution monitoring station at Knowledge Park 3 recording an AQI of 410. The situation was better in Knowledge Park 5, which was the only station in all three districts to record an AQI of 388 in the ‘very poor’ category. Adverse meteorological conditions such as slow wind speed, low temperature and low mixing height, coupled with stubble burning and cracker bursting, are impacting air quality in these districts.  According to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), the AQI may drop to the upper end of the 'very poor' category in the next few days since surface wind is becoming stronger and dispersing air pollutants. Strong northwesterly wind will further disperse pollutants from stubble burning, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/ghaziabad-is-most-polluted-city-noida-close-on-its-heels/articleshow/87562473.cms||Abhijay Jha

---||Gurgaon||Gurgaon’s pollution level ‘severe’ for the second day in a row||Gurgaon: A thick blanket of smog continued to engulf the city as the 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) across several monitoring stations was recorded at the ‘severe’ category for the second consecutive day on Saturday. The air quality, however, improved slightly due to higher wind speed and is expected to further flush out pollutants from Sunday onwards, weather experts said. According to Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB), the city’s air quality index (AQI) stood at 456 on Saturday. Due to rampant bursting of crackers on Diwali on Thursday despite restrictions, coupled with a rise in incidents of stubble burning, the city’s AQI had slipped to the ‘severe’ category to reach 472 on Friday. An AQI between 401 and 500 is considered ‘severe’. On Saturday, Vikas Sadan, Sector 51 and Teri Gram air monitoring stations recorded AQIs at 492, 499 and 419, respectively. Statistics for the Gwal Pahari centre was not available because of insufficient data. The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), however, predicted that the pollutants would clear out of the city’s air as wind speed had picked up since Saturday evening. On Saturday, the average speed was recorded at six kilometres per hour (km/hr), up from the three km/hr a day ago. Besides calm winds, unfavourable weather conditions like low temperature and low mixing height had also degraded the city’s air quality over the last few days, experts said. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), Gurgaon’s minimum temperature was recorded at 16 degrees Celsius and maximum at 26.2 degrees on Saturday. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy at CSE, meanwhile, told TOI that stubble burning had also added to Gurgaon’s air pollution. “We do not have any mechanism in place to check the contribution of stubble burning share in Gurgaon’s air quality at the moment, but of course it is affecting the district’s AQI as we have data that it is clearly impacting Delhi’s air,” Roychowdhury said. The civic authorities, meanwhile, said they have upped pollution mitigation measures by sprinkling water on roads and continuing night patrolling. “We have urged corporates and RWAs to start sprinkling water across Gurgaon,” Kuldeep Singh, HSPCB regional officer, said. Delhi’s air quality may see an improvement, too, with IMD forecasting strong surface winds at 20-30 kmph on Sunday. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), a pollution monitoring body under the Union ministry of earth sciences, said, “Delhi’s AQI is likely to improve to upper end of ‘very poor’ category as surface winds are becoming stronger, dispersing air pollutants. Strong north-westerly winds enhance transport of emissions from stubble burning. Share of crop residue burning emissions in PM2.5 is 41% (Effective fire count 5,159).” The CPCB’s central control room data showed that Delhi-NCR's average 24-hour PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations were 429 micrograms per cubic metre and 298 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively, at 7pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gurgaons-pollution-level-severe-for-the-second-day-in-a-row/articleshow/87560957.cms||Ipsita Pati

---||Chennai||TN can't levy stamp duty on mutual funds, says PIL||CHENNAI: Can a state government levy stamp duty on mutual fund transactions, that too in the absence of a specific legislation? Raising this important question of law, a Chennai-based sexagenarian has moved Madras high court challenging stamp duty levied by Tamil Nadu government on purchase of mutual funds. Y R Gnanamani argued that such duty cannot be levied in the state since Tamil Nadu has not enacted any law to indicate the rate of stamp duty that can be collected for mutual fund transactions. Admitting the plea, the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P D Audikesavalu directed the state government to respond to the plea in a fortnight. According to the petitioner, a completely flawed procedure is being followed and investors have been taxed without any authority or sanction of law. "Mutual funds and other instruments, which can fall within the ambit of Article 56-A of the First Schedule to the Stamp Act, are taxed at such rate and the quantum passed on to the individual states, possibly on the basis of the residential status of the investors," she added. She said states have not enacted any law to indicate the rate at which such instruments would be subjected to levy of stamp duty and, at any rate, there is no such legislation in Tamil Nadu. Therefore, in the absence of a state setting the rate of stamp duty in respect of such instruments like certificates pertaining to mutual funds, the very authority to impose tax or receive the same is absent and non-existent, she said. According to the petitioner, Entry 91 in List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution pertains to rates of stamp duty in respect of bills of exchange. Instruments not specifically included in Entry 91 of List I are deemed to be included by virtue of the residuary clause which appears as Entry 63 in List II, she said. The petitioner further referred to Article 56-A of Schedule I to the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 that provides for the rates of stamp duty pertaining to securities other than debentures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-cant-levy-stamp-duty-on-mutual-funds-says-pil/articleshow/87562542.cms||Sureshkumar

---||Delhi||Delhi cricket loses its father figure||NEW DELHI: Delhi cricket has lost its Ustad-ji. Coach Tarak Sinha, whose list of disciples reads like a who’s who of the city’s premier cricketers — Manoj Prabhakar, Ashish Nehra, Anjum Chopra, Shikhar Dhawan, Rishabh Pant, to name a few — passed away on Saturday morning after battling lung cancer for two months. He was 71. Sinha never married. But he was a father figure to several generations of cricketers who mourned his passing. Dhawan was with the family as they performed the last rites. Nehra took the first flight out of Goa to get a last glimpse of his mentor. On a video call from Dubai to Sinha’s family, Rishabh Pant was inconsolable. “Tarak sir is not like my father. He is my father,” he had once said. Sinha, who founded the Sonnet Club in 1969, coached three generations of cricketers. He received the Dronacharya Award, rather belatedly, in 2018. Some other internationals coached by him are Surinder Khanna, Raman Lamba, Ajay Sharma, Atul Wassan and Sanjiv Sharma. Virender Sehwag, who turned up at Sonnet where Sinha’s mortal remains were taken one last time, tweeted, “He was one of the rare coaches who gave India more than a dozen Test cricketers & the values he inculcated in his students helped Indian cricket immensely.” Sinha’s impact and influence spread across geographies and gender. A Ranji team from Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi still has at least one player from the Sonnet stable. Deepak Chahar owes his career to Sinha after Greg Chappell, then involved with Rajasthan cricket, had rejected him in 2009. Other than coaching former India women’s captain Anjum Chopra, Sinha played a huge role in grooming pacer Jhulan Goswami when he was given the charge of the women’s team. “Deeply saddened by the demise of Tarak Sinha sir who helped me a lot in my younger days,” Goswami tweeted. Sinha was an old-school coach but open to the new ways of cricket. Sinha understood the demands of the IPL generation but drilled it in their minds that “a cricketer is a true international player only if he plays Test cricket”. And he never tampered with a player’s natural instinct. “He never stopped Rishabh from playing aggressive strokes. He let him be. He just worked on his techniques so that he could bat long. Had he asked Rishabh to curb his game, he would have done it blindly but he would not have been Rishabh Pant,” said former Delhi wicketkeeper Devendra Sharma and Sinha’s closest associate and confidant in running the club. For Sinha, a player’s allround growth was critical. At Sonnet, he would sit under the sun wearing a floppy hat taking down details of every player in his notebook. “When are your exams?” is the first question he would shoot to his wards by the end of January every year. The matches were distributed accordingly for the rest of the season. The notebook had the waist size of each of his students. The kits would keep coming all-round the year. As the rites were done, many cricketers recalled their personal experiences. Former India opener Aakash Chopra stressed on how he shaped his life and not just his career. Former Delhi captain Mithun Manhas said whenever a player felt he was struggling for form, he would immediately spend a day with Ustad-ji and the cobwebs in his head would be cleared. Wassan proffered how he imbued a humane aspect to coaching and let the players be themselves. Tarak wanted to be a father figure first, then a coach. Devendra said: “When I first met him, he first asked me if I had eaten or not. He would first ensure the students are well taken care of.” “ Taking fees was the last thing on his mind. He spent money from his salary to ensure that the players got more tournaments to play. Even when Nehra was going to play for India, Tarak sir had paid for his bowling shoes,” Devendra told TOI. Sinha is known by the players he has produced but the players live by his name.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-cricket-loses-its-father-figure/articleshow/87562776.cms||Arani Basu
---||World||Mexico arrests two suspects in beach shooting||MEXICO CITY: Mexican authorities on Saturday arrested two people suspected of involvement in a shooting between rival gangs on a beach near the Caribbean resort of Cancun that left two people dead. The armed clash, which took place on Thursday, was the second to shake Mexico's Riviera Maya in recent weeks and is another blow to a tourism industry still recovering from the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. The attorney general's office for the eastern state of Quintana Roo said it had managed to locate three of the four vehicles the suspected shooters used to travel to the beach. They arrested two people who had been driving, while one managed to escape. "Two drivers were captured while a third one fled, and there was even an exchange of gunfire with police officers, managing to escape to a jungle area," the attorney general said in a statement. The office also said initial investigations showed that the groups involved that day had split off from the Sinaloa cartel who "are disputing territory for the sale of drugs." The shooting on November 4 took place on the beach outside one of the luxury resort hotels near Cancun, a popular tourist destination. Local authorities had said the clash was between rival gangs of drug dealers. Mexico is plagued by cartel-related bloodshed that has seen more than 300,000 people murdered since the government deployed the military in the war on drugs in 2006. While the Riviera Maya, home to Cancun and other leading resorts including Playa del Carmen and Tulum, is generally considered safer than much of the country, there has been an increase in violence. Last month, two tourists from Germany and India were killed in a shootout between suspected drug dealers in Tulum, while several others were wounded. In 2017, three foreigners were among five killed in a shooting at an electronic music festival in Playa del Carmen. The incidents have led European countries and the United States to warn their citizens about the risks of visiting the Mexican Caribbean, among the world's top beach destinations. Tourism represents 8.5 per cent of Mexico's gross domestic product and is the main economic activity in the southeast region, which includes the Riviera Maya. Although Mexico has remained open to foreigners during the Covid-19 pandemic, a slump in visitor numbers has taken a heavy toll on the country's tourism industry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/mexico-arrests-two-suspects-in-beach-shooting/articleshow/87562918.cms||---

An artillery firing competition among mechanised units was held on Saturday, with senior government and military officials present, the official Korean Central News Agency reported. Leader Kim Jong Un was not mentioned in the report, suggesting he did not observe the training. He supervised a similar artillery firing drill last year. This year's drills were designed to inspect the mechanised units' progress in their mobile combat capabilities and to further intensify competitive training throughout the North's military, KCNA said. Since September, North Korea has test-launched a series of newly developed missiles, including nuclear-capable weapons that place US allies South Korea and Japan within striking distance. Some experts say North Korea wants its rivals to accept it as a nuclear power state and work to ease international sanctions on the country. The North's artillery tests draw less outside attention than its missile tests, particularly ballistic weapons launches that are banned by multiple UN Security Council resolutions. But its long-range artillery pieces deployed near the border with South Korea pose a serious threat to the South's populous metropolitan region and other areas, experts say. US-led talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear programme collapsed in early 2019 amid bickering over the sanctions. US officials have recently offered a resumption of talks with North Korea without any preconditions. The North said it won't return to the talks unless the United States first abandons what Pyongyang calls its hostile policy, an apparent reference to the sanctions and regular military drills between Washington and Seoul.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/n-korea-stages-artillery-firing-drill-in-latest-weapons-test/articleshow/87562959.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Doctors, healthworkers demand booster shot in Kolkata||KOLKATA: There is growing demand for a booster dose of the anti-Covid shot among doctors and other healthcare workers (HCWs) in Kolkata. HCWs were the first to be vaccinated when the inoculation drive was rolled out in mid-January this year. For many who took the vaccine at the very beginning, it is already seven to eight months after completion of the vaccination, causing an anxiety about waning protection against the virus. Times ViewAcross-section of medical experts have supported the demand for booster doses, especially for sections of the population that are more vulnerable or exposed to the virus. It makes sense at a time when an uptick in the virus’s spread is coinciding with reopening of sectors.“I was among the first lot to take the jab on January 16 and I got my second dose by March first week. It is high time that the government comes out with a policy to offer a booster dose to HCWs at least to begin with,” said a doctor at government run Medical College Hospital Kolkata. A booster dose is an additional shot to prevent fading away of the protection provided by the original dosage. Few developed countries like USA and UK have already started administering the booster dose to its HCWs. “The booster dose is the need of the hour. But when exactly to give the booster shot for the best result is also a question. Assessing of such timings should be done soon so that booster dose can be offered at the earliest as the immune response of the vaccine is expected to start depleting after nine months,” said Prabhash Prasun Giri, associate professor of paediatrics at Institute of Child Health. Organisations like Association of Health Service Doctors (AHSD) have written to Mamata Banerjee appealing to the Bengal CM to take up the booster shot issue with competent technical body at the national level. “We strongly demand booster doses to be given to doctors and other HCWs at the earliest,” said AHSD general secretary Manas Gumta professor of surgery. Senior clinical pharmacologist Santanu Tripathi said protection through vaccines is not for indefinite period; hence there is some justification in the demand for booster doses at least for those vulnerable like the doctors. “Beyond nine months of taking the second dose the protection would start waning. How fast the depletion will be is still a matter of study/investigation. The booster dose will be required. However, it will face logistic challenges given the demand-supply mismatch and the fact that we still have a large population yet to get even a single dose. The government should consider the pros and cons before introducing the booster dose,” said Tripathi. Director of pulmonology at CMRI Raja Dhar is hopeful of a booster dose soon but felt the need to wait for at least 50% of the eligible population of the country to get the two doses before a booster dose is rolled out. “Once we have around 50% of eligible population inoculated with both the doses we can start offering the booster dose starting with HCWs and then go onto other people in high-risk group like those with co-morbidity etc,” said Dhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/docs-healthworkers-demand-booster-shot/articleshow/87559868.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

They have started using the home-grown vaccine, that was not recognized in most countries till the WHO approval, at off-site camps and are also calling up potential recipients to consider taking Covaxin. If the results don’t turn out to be encouraging, some hospitals may even offer Covaxin free of cost to recipients. “Our stock will reach the expiry date by this month-end. We have around 500 doses left and have started offering it at our off-site camps at Girish Park and in Shantiniketan. Some had called us and said they are willing to take it while we called some others who have agreed. We needed at least 10 recipients to use a vial which has 10 doses. On Saturday we had a group of 10 after a long time and could use a vial,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. He, however, added that the hospital will not counsel patients to take Covaxin. “We are merely telling recipients that it’s available but not advising them to take it. The demand for Covishield remains much higher,” said Mitra. AMRI Hospitals have approached KMC councillors to help them identify unvaccinated residents at their wards for Covaxin doses. “We will administer the vaccine free of cost at off-site camps once we can identify a substantial number of recipients with the help of councillors. We will launch an effort from Monday and try to use as much of the stock as possible. It will be sad if Covaxin vials are wasted for they are a precious resource,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. Woodlands Hospital, too, is left with a stock of 7,000 doses. It has been administering the vaccine between 1 pm and 3 pm every day. “But the demand remains low despite the WHO approval,” said Woodlands managing director and CEO Rupali Basu. Several others, including Belle Vue Clinic, RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) and Medica Superspecialty have exhausted their Covaxin stocks and not replenished it. “We had acquired 2,500 doses at the beginning of vaccination but since it moved very slowly, we decided to stick to just Covishield,” said Belle Vue CEO P Tondon. Medica has exhausted its Covaxin stock and doesn’t plan to procure more unless there is a significant improvement in demand. “With the WHO approving it, we see a slight increase in demand for Covaxin. We have exhausted our stock last month and will await the market response in the near future before acquiring fresh stocks,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pvt-hosps-hold-camps-eye-kmc-tie-up-to-use-up-covaxin-stocks/articleshow/87559893.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Sharma’s threat came in a statement issued in reaction to the confinement drama which unfolded at a temple in Rohtak’s Kiloi village. Sharma said he had won the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Rohtak only due to the efforts by Grover. “Congress party and Deepender Hooda must listen carefully: if anyone dares to cast any evil eye on Manish Grover, his eyes would gouged out; if anyone raises hand, it would be chopped,” said Sharma. Attacking fomer CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda’s family, Sharma said the Congress could make any effort, but the BJP was not going to leave the seat of power for 25 years. “Barring Rohtak and Jhajjar, the Congress has lost its base in the rest of Haryana. People in Rohtak are under the impression that Bhupinder Singh Hooda may become chief minister, but it is not going to happen anytime soon,” Sharma added. Meanwhile, Grover said he was confined to the temple for several hours at the behest of Bhupinder Hooda’s son, Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Singh Hooda. “There were no farmers outside the temple. Only Deepender Hooda’s supporters were there outside Kiloi temple,” Grover claimed. BJP workers and Grover’s supporters also burnt an effigy of Congress leaders in Rohtak, holding them responsible for Friday’s event at Kiloi temple. BJP leaders, including Grover, had gone to Kiloi village’s temple on Friday to watch the live telecast of PM Narendra Modi’s Kedarnath visit. Farmers and villagers there forced them to stay indoors till Grover sought an apology for visiting the temple in the backdrop of boycott call of BJP-JJP leaders in the ongoing ‘Kisan Andolan’.

Subhajit Sur, an engineering graduate, died before cops and locals could rush him to a nearby hospital. He had promised his elder sister Suparna that he would head to her Mukundapur home for Bhai Phonta after completing his uncle’s cashless claims. Subhajit, who stayed in Garia’s Sahapara, had taken out his bike — WB01AQ-6196 — telling his elderly parents that he would be back after visiting his sister’s home. As Subhajit was coming down the north-bound flank, a private bus plying on the Garia Station-Baghbazar route hit him from behind. The impact hurled Subhajit on the road and he was mowed down by the bus. The bus driver refused to stop the vehicle, and according to witnesses, he then jumped off the running bus to flee. So did the conductor. Witnesses also claimed that the bus had around 50 people in it. One of the passengers panicked and tried to jump out of the moving bus. This passenger, who could not be identified, was injured. So were a few others. Then one passenger headed to the cabin, took the driver’s seat, and applied the brakes to stop the moving bus. By then the bus had travelled several hundred metres mowing down Subhajit completely. A local, who witnessed the incident, said, “It could have been a bigger disaster hadn’t one passenger stopped the moving bus.” Police and locals immediately ran towards the spot and tried to rush Subhajit to the Peerless Hospital but he didn’t survive the fatal crash. Suparna, who reached the hospital only to see her brother’s body, said: “He had promised me he would take Bhai Phonta from me. I was waiting for him. Our lives have ended with him.” Suparna was married a year-and-a-half ago but has been the family’s backbone helping Subhajit to complete his engineering studies after their father, Sudhanshu Sur, retired as a KMC employee. . Subhajit, who had got a job recently, was the family’s only earning member. Survey Park police arrested the conductor. But the driver is absconding. The Cossipore-based bus owner is also being questioned. Police said they were scanning CCTV footages to understand if the driver could be charged with culpable homicide. The bus and Subhajit’s bike will undergo forensic and mechanical tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bus-crushes-biker-in-bagha-jatin-driver-jumps-off-running-vehicle/articleshow/87559899.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

If there are mistakes or changes pertaining to name, gender, father’s name or address have to be made in the existing voters’ list, one needs to submit Form 8. “Those who have shifted their residence within the constituency need to submit Form 8 (A). For those who’ve moved to other constituencies, Form 7 has to be filled...Form 6 must be submitted to enrol as a new voter,” said Dayanand. He added: “If someone in the family has died and the name has to be removed, Form 7 should be submitted.” First-time voters born between January 2, 2002 and January 1, 2003 have to furnish agerelated verification documents like Aadhaar card, birth certificate, PAN card and driving licence to get their names included in the voters’ list. The civic body has organised special registration drives between 10am and 5pm on every Sunday (for a month) from November 7 at voter registration officers, ward help centres and polling booths.

The unions claim the flareup occured after someone from the MP’s convoy hit a farmer, Kuldeep Rana, 39, with the butt of a gun. They claim to have eyewitnesses of the incident as well. However, Hansi’s superintendent of police claimed the farmer had a bout of epilepsy. The farmer unions now want the police to cancel the FIR lodged against the farmers and book the MP and his guards instead, else they threatened to gherao the SP’s office on Monday. It has to be mentioned that there were several women present in the protest site. Former legislator Ram Bhagat and Indian National Lok Dal’s Umaid Lohan, Rajendra Sura, Rajbir Mor, and Satbir Sisai were there too. Commenting on the incident, farmer unionist Suresh Koth claimed it wasn’t epilepsy but the hit of a rifle butt that that had caused farmer Kuldeep to faint, and so it was a police case. He said: "Yes, he wasn’t injured in the cane charge but someone from the MP’s car hit him. His family will file a complaint." On the protest of Jangra society, Suresh Koth claimed that the government wanted to give a caste angle to the farmers’ agitation even though the participants had celebrated Chhotu Ram Jayanti, Vishwakarma Jayanti, and other festivals together. He said they were not opposed to any politician of a particular caste, but were against the BJP-JJP combine government. Meanwhile, Saroj Rana, wife of injured farmer Kuldeep Rana of Satrod Khas, said the police was claiming that her husband was a patient of epilepsy, but in reality he hadn’t taken even a headache pill in 20 years. She claimed that one of his veins had ruptured in the "police assault" and doctors had advised him not to speak for 72 hours. On the other hand, the Sanyukt Kisan Morch (SKM), which leads the farmers’ agitation, has demanded that BJP MP Ramkumar Jangra and his associates be booked for injuring protester Kuldeep Rana. It also wants the Narnaund cases against farmers Harshdeep Gill, Kailash and Sudhir to be scrapped as the injured farmers underwent a surgery and his condition continues to be critical. The SKM warned the BJP-JJP combine against using colleges and temples for its party activities. In Rohtak, they cordoned a Shiva temple of Kiloi village to confined a BJP group for several hours. Meanwhile, the antim ardas for three women protesters who died in October 28’s road accident at the protest side in Tikri will be at Mansa’s Kheva Dayalpura village on Sunday. A tipper truck crushed Amarjeet Kaur, Gurmail Kaur, and Sukhwinder Kaur and injured two other women, Harmeet Kaur and Gurmail Kaur, critically. The farmers claimed that the Punjab government’s compensation to their families was too small to even cover their debts. The SKM claimed continued shortage of DAP (diammonium phosphate) and other fertilisers, besides black marketing are making life tough for the farming community. Questioning the NCRB (National Crime Records Bureau) data about farm suicides, it claimed that Bihar, West Bengal, Uttarakhand, and Tripura could not have zero cases without data manipulation. It claimed that the figures for most states were suppressed and the data sources were not authentic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/hisar-police-station-still-under-siege-farmer-hurt-in-assault/articleshow/87563039.cms||KUMAR MUKESH

After hearing a batch of petitions filed by vehicle owners, who challenged car seizures and the prolonged wait to get vehicles back, Justice K Lakshman in his order ruled, “If there is no one accompanying the drunk driver, then the police should inform a relative or friends of the intoxicated man to take custody of the vehicle.” The judge added that if no one comes forward to take the vehicle, only then can the police keep the vehicle at the nearest police station or some other safe custody and should release it either to the owner or any authorized person. The judge, however, agreed with the state home department counsel, G Srikanth Reddy’s contention that an intoxicated driver should not be allowed to drive from the point where he is caught. “If a police officer comes to a conclusion that prosecution of a driver or owner or both is necessary, he shall file a chargesheet against them before a magistrate within three days from the date of seizure of the vehicle,” Justice Lakshman said in his order. “The vehicle shall be released by the officer who detained it after prosecution is completed under intimation to the regional transport authorities.” The order directed magistrates to receive the chargesheets within three days from the date of seizure if the chargesheets are otherwise in order. If no one claims custody of the vehicle, the police can take necessary steps, the order read. “Any breach of these directives will result in contempt cases against errant officers,” the judge warned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/police-cant-seize-drunk-drivers-vehicle-says-telangana-high-court/articleshow/87563047.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

---||World||Changing guard at Buckingham Palace: Camilla steps up||LONDON: A gradual changing of the guard is happening at the head of Britain's royal family, as Queen Elizabeth II steps back from public engagements due to her advanced age and health. The 95-year-old monarch's eldest son and heir, Charles, Prince of Wales, has been shouldering more of the burden of official duties for several years, including overseas. But his wife, Camilla, is increasingly stepping into the fray, both online during coronavirus pandemic restrictions in the past year and now in person, after curbs were lifted. Joining the couple at the royal vanguard are Charles' eldest son from his first marriage to Princess Diana, William, and his wife, Kate. As a result, they have earned a greater share of the media coverage that would previously have gone to the monarch, who has been advised to rest by doctors. Their presence at events -- from the world premiere of the latest James Bond film to meeting world leaders at the G7 and UN climate summits -- is a clear sign of change to come. Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty Magazine, told AFP their visibility "will accelerate within the fullness of time". "But a lot of people are now familiar with Camilla and are getting to know her," he added. Camilla, 74, also known as the Duchess of Cornwall, will become consort when Charles, 72, takes the throne. William, 39, will move up the line of succession to heir apparent. Only a few years ago, a different "Fab Four" were seen as the future of Britain's most famous family: William and Kate along with his younger brother Harry and his wife Meghan. But plans changed dramatically last year when Harry and Meghan moved to the United States, from where they have criticised the family and even accused it of racism. The rise of Camilla -- once a hate-figure for being "the other woman" in Charles and Diana's marriage -- has been remarkable. "Her position has certainly evolved and there's been a huge and very long process of rehabilitation since... she was described as this rottweiler at the time of Diana," royal historian Anna Whitelock told the Daily Express. Camilla, like other royals, was forced into a more public role by the coronavirus pandemic, when the world moved online. But she has taken on the role with aplomb and won fans, even if in the eyes of some she can never be forgiven for her role in the collapse of Charles and Diana's marriage. "There are lots of Camilla supporters out there," said Little. "The sense is she's coping with it very well. She's been a member of the royal family for 16 years, so she's had quite a bit of experience of high-profile things... "She's become very proficient at it." Since the death of the Queen's husband of 73 years, Prince Philip, in April, Camilla has been seen -- and heard -- more frequently at official royal engagements and charity events. This week she accompanied Charles -- a longstanding environmentalist -- to the UN COP26 summit in Glasgow, to urge world leaders to stop runaway climate change. Last month she and Charles, who married in 2005, supported the Queen at the official opening of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh and the Welsh Assembly in Cardiff. She was also present as the monarch undertook her first ceremonial engagement since her husband's death -- the State Opening of Parliament in May. In the coming weeks, the couple embark on the first royal overseas tour since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, visiting Egypt, which will host COP27, and Jordan. Camilla's appearances elsewhere reflect her variety of interests, from promoting literacy via her popular Instagram book club to championing rescue animals. She gave a well-received speech and backing to a campaign tackling violence against women, dovetailing with support given by Kate to the issue earlier this year. Camilla has also made several television and radio appearances, speaking about her mother's battle with osteoporosis and her love of gardening and horse breeding. Reports said she could soon take on a bigger role as one of the "counsellors of state", a group of senior royals appointed to step in if the Queen cannot perform her official duties. Speculation has mounted because the other counsellors alongside Charles and William -- Prince Andrew and Harry -- are no longer serving royals. "The Queen may look to add the Duchess of Cornwall, who would become a counsellor of state when Charles is king anyway," constitutional expert Craig Prescott from Bangor University told the Mail on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/changing-guard-at-buckingham-palace-camilla-steps-up/articleshow/87563112.cms||---

Prices also remained static on Sunday in Kolkata where the price of petrol reduced by Rs 5.82 to Rs 104.67 per litre and that of diesel by Rs 11.77 to Rs 89.79 per litre on the previous day. Petrol price in Chennai also remains at Rs 101.40 per litre and diesel Rs 91.43 per litre. Across the country as well price of the fuel largely remained unchanged on Sunday barring a few states where VAT reduction would translate into lower prices from Sunday. The good news on the fuel price front is that global crude prices have softened to around $82 a barrel now from a three year high level of over $85 a barrel just a few days back. If the price line holds, fuel prices in India could come down further and increases could be checked. Before price cuts and pause, diesel prices have increased on 30 out of the last 44 days taking up its retail price by Rs 9.90 per litre in Delhi. Petrol prices have also risen 28 of the previous 40 days taking up its pump price by Rs 8.85 per litre. Since January 1, petrol and diesel prices have risen by more than Rs 26 a litre before the duty cuts. The excise duty cut by the Centre is the first such exercise since the onset of Covid pandemic. In fact, the government had revised excise duty on petrol and diesel sharply in March and again in May last year to mobilise additional resources for Covid relief measures. The excise duty was raised by Rs 13 and Rs 16 per litre on petrol and diesel between March 2020 and May 2020 and was standing high at Rs 31.8 on diesel and Rs 32.9 per litre on petrol before finally the Centre decided on duty cut.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/markets/sensex/petrol-diesel-price-rise-on-pause-after-duty-cuts/articleshow/87563182.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Slain tiger Heera’s skin found in a pond near Panna Tiger Reserve||BHOPAL: The skin of the tiger famed as Heera of Panna Tiger Reserve has been found floating in a pond in a village in Satna, not far from where its mutilated carcass was discovered on October 31. The three men in custody, who had allegedly peeled the skin off the tiger after it was electrocuted, have told forest officials that they didn’t intend to kill it. They claim to have illegally electrified their fence to protect their crops. When Heera got electrocuted on the wires, they panicked and tried to dispose of its remains. But forest officials arrived on the scene before they could destroy or hide the entire carcass. They didn’t realise Panna’s radio collar would alert foresters and pinpoint the tiger’s location. After interrogating the suspects — Ramprakash Bagri, Munna Chaudhary and Krishna — the forest department found the skin in a pond. “The fence covered three sides of the farm and the tiger came in contact with it. The farmers panicked and decided to peel off its skin so that they could hide the meat and dispose of everything separately. They dumped the skin in water, hoping that it would decompose soon. They were not aware of the radio collar, which led foresters to the spot,” said an officer. “If they had any commercial intention, they wouldn’t have dumped the skin in water. It was a panic action,” he said. All three have been booked under Wildlife Protection Act. Panna’s death is seen as a blow to ‘Tiger State’ Madhya Pradesh. Not only was a young tiger killed, it was one of the famous Heera-Panna siblings and it was also the subject of an exhaustive radio-collar study on dispersal of tigers. Heera and Panna were frequently spotted and photographed in PTR’s Akola range, and were the sole reason for the dramatic rise in tourist footfall in that region. Heera’s rotting and skinned carcass was found in Singhpur range, around 70km away from Satna district headquarters, last Sunday. The site is close to PTR in the Vindhya landscape, where tigers are known to disperse. Heera was in fact moving out in search of new territory when it was killed. Heera and Panna had moved outside PTR on July 24. The last signal received from Heera’s collar was on October 13, said an officer. Questions are being raised as to why forest officials took 15 days to react even when the signals failed. Heera’s radio collar was found a short distance from where its carcass lay. The tiger was around 22-monthsold. Panna is home to more than 70 tigers, 50 of them above the age of one year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-slain-tiger-heeras-skin-found-in-a-pond-near-panna-tiger-reserve/articleshow/87563193.cms||P Naveen

Despite turning down such queries, cricket fans are eager to know result of the forthcoming match after Team India’s back-to-back debacle against Pakistan and New Zealand. Bhopal-based tarot card reader, Kahkasha Saxena, said that queries about India’s chances have been highest in the past few days. “I have been receiving several calls and texts about the future of Team India. I have to tell them every time that I don’t do it as it is against the ethics of my knowledge. However, cricket fans insist on telling them about it. My only answer to them has been a firm ‘no’,” said Saxena. Saxena said that this is happening after longtime as the situation of Team India is hanging in balance. “Such queries about the future of the Indian team have been there in other tournaments as well. However, this time it is exponential after India lost two crucial matches in the beginning of the tournament,” she added. Astrologer Ravi Acharya said, “I had to tell the cricket fans that I can’t make such predictions as it can lead to betting. Despite this they insist and I have only sympathy with them.” He was also surprised when he started receiving such calls in the past few days. “I have been receiving such calls during IPL and other big tournaments but this time it is something much higher. Such number of calls are enough to gauge the madness about cricket in this country,” he said. Another Bhopal-based astrologer, Rajesh Dubey said that people are becoming so keen to know about India’s chances in the world cup that they were even ready to pay a heavy fee also. “I have only one word for them that such predictions are against ethics. People still made several calls,” said Dubey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/cricket-fans-in-bhopal-shuffle-tarot-cards-consult-astrologers-as-team-indias-fate-at-icc-wc-hangs-in-balance/articleshow/87563245.cms||Ramendra Singh
---||World||Iraq PM Mustafa al-Kadhemi: Former spy chief facing uncertain future||BAGHDAD: Iraq's prime minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi -- who survived an assassination attempt on Sunday -- is a former spy chief and skilled negotiator who faces an uncertain future following last month's legislative elections. Kadhemi, who headed Iraq's National Intelligence Service (INIS), took the reins in May last year after parliament granted his cabinet a vote of confidence, capping weeks of horse-trading over ministerial positions. Born in Baghdad in 1967, he studied law in Iraq but then left for Europe to escape repressive dictator Saddam Hussein, working as an opposition journalist. After the US-led 2003 invasion toppled Hussein, Kadhemi returned to help launch the Iraqi Media Network, archived crimes of the former regime at the Iraqi Memory Foundation and worked as a human rights advocate. But he made an unusual career jump in 2016, when then-PM Haider al-Abadi handpicked him to head the INIS at the height of the war against the Islamic State jihadist group. It was there, sources close to Kadhemi say, that he formed his uniquely close links with top players of key nations including in Washington, London and closer to home. "He's got a pragmatic mindset, relationships with all the key players on the Iraqi scene and good ties with the Americans -- and he was recently able to put his ties to the Iranians back on track," a political source and friend told AFP. The former journalist has a particularly close friendship with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. In footage from a visit to Riyadh after his appointment, the Saudi royal could be seen warmly embracing Kadhemi. But the clean-shaven man, his closely trimmed hair tinged by white around his ears, has otherwise mostly remained in the shadows. Kadhemi was first floated as premier in 2018 but political blocs instead opted for Adel Abdel Mahdi -- the caretaker PM who resigned in December 2019 after months of protests, and whom Kadhemi replaced. The intel chief's name began circulating a few months later as President Barham Saleh's preferred candidate, but a political adviser close to the talks told AFP he had hesitated to take the risk. "He did not want to agree unless it was going to be a sure thing," the adviser said, having seen two candidates -- lawmaker Adnan Zurfi and ex-minister Mohammad Allawi -- fail before him. Allawi could not pull together a cabinet by his 30-day deadline while Zurfi dropped his bid under pressure from Shiite parties close to Iran, who saw the lawmaker as worryingly close to Washington. In January 2020, those same factions had accused Kadhemi of being involved in the US drone strike that killed Iranian general Qasem Soleimani and Iraqi commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in Baghdad. But Kadhemi worked through the caretaker PM's influential chief of staff Mohammad al-Hashemi to repair ties with Iran and its allies in Iraq, the adviser and a diplomat based in Baghdad told AFP. With pro-Tehran factions on board, the adviser said, Kadhemi scored "an unprecedented Shiite-wide consensus". That set Kadhemi up with better chances than the two prior candidates, but he has faced a host of challenges, from the country's ailing economy to the coronavirus. He brought forward elections, originally scheduled for 2022, in response to the anti-government protests over endemic corruption, unemployment and failing public services. But the results of those elections now mean he is facing an uncertain future, with coalition wrangling and accusations of fraud. A figure like Kadhemi could have the right connections to steer Iraq through these crises, observers say. "Kadhemi is a superb negotiator and an incredibly astute player," said Toby Dodge, head of the London School for Economics' Middle East Centre. But, he cautioned: "Iraq is on borrowed time -- the stakes have gone up much higher."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/iraq-pm-kadhemi-former-spy-chief-facing-uncertain-future/articleshow/87563284.cms||---

---||World||Explainer: Here is why crowd surges can kill people||NEW YORK: The crowd deaths at a Houston music festival added even more names to the long list of people who have been crushed at a major event. Tragedies like the one Friday night at the Astroworld Music Festival have been happening for a long time. In 1979, 11 people died in a scramble to enter a Cincinnati, Ohio, concert by The Who. At the Hillsborough soccer stadium in England, a human crush in 1989 led to nearly 100 deaths. In 2015, a collision of two crowds at the hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia caused more than 2,400 deaths, based on an Associated Press count of media reports and officials' comments. Now that more people are heading out of their homes and back into crowds after many months of being cooped up because of the pandemic, the risks are rising again. Most major events happen without a death, of course, but experts say they see common traits within the tragedies. Here's a look at how they happen: HOW ARE PEOPLE DYING IN THESE EVENTS?They're often getting squeezed so hard that they can't get any oxygen. It's usually not because they're getting trampled. When a crowd surges, the force can be strong enough to bend steel. It can also hit people from two directions: one from the rear of the crowd pushing forward and another from the front of the crowd trying to escape. If some people have fallen, causing a pileup, pressure can even come from above. Caught in the middle are people's lungs. WHAT'S IT LIKE TO BE SWEPT IN?A U.K. inquiry into the Hillsborough tragedy found that a form of asphyxiation was listed as an underlying cause in the vast majority of the deaths. Other listed causes included "inhalation of stomach contents.'' The deaths occurred as more than 50,000 fans streamed into the stadium for a soccer match on a warm, sunny day. Some of them packed into a tunnel and were getting pressed so hard into perimeter fencing that their faces got distorted by the mesh, the inquiry found. "Survivors described being gradually compressed, unable to move, their heads `locked between arms and shoulders ... faces gasping in panic,''' the report said. ``They were aware that people were dying and they were helpless to save themselves.'' WHAT CAUSES SUCH EVENTS?"My research covers over 100 years of disasters, and invariably they all come down to very similar characteristics,'' said G. Keith Still, a visiting professor of crowd science at the University of Suffolk in England who has testified as an expert witness in court cases involving crowds. First is the design of the event, including making sure that the density of the crowd doesn't exceed guidelines set by the National Fire Protection Association and others. That includes having enough space for everyone and large enough gaps for people to move about. Some venues will take precautions when they know a particularly high-energy crowd is coming to an event. Still pointed to how some will set up pens around stages in order to break large crowds into smaller groups. That can also allow for pathways for security officers or for emergency exits. WHAT ARE OTHER CAUSES?The crowd's density may be the most important factor in a deadly surge, but it usually needs a catalyst to get everyone rushing in the same direction. A sudden downpour of rain or hail could send everyone running for cover, as was the case when 93 soccer fans in Nepal were killed while surging toward locked stadium exits in 1988. Or, in an example that Still said is much more common in the United States than other countries, someone yells, ``He has a gun!'' Surges don't always happen because people are running away from something. Sometimes they're caused by a crowd moving toward something, such as a performer on the stage, before they hit a barrier. Still also cited poor crowd-management systems, where event organizers don't have strong procedures in place to report red flags or warnings, among the reasons deadly surges happen. HOW HAS THE PANDEMIC AFFECTED THINGS?Steve Allen of Crowd Safety, a U.K.-based consultancy engaged in major events around the world, said it's always important to monitor the crowd, but especially so now that events are ramping up in size following the the pandemic lockdown. ``As soon as you add people into the mix, there will always be a risk,'' he said of crowds. He recommends that events have trained crowd spotters with noise-cancelling headsets who are in direct communication with someone in close proximity to the performer who's willing to temporarily stop the event if there's a life-threatening situation. That could be a crowd surge, structural collapse, fire or something else. Allen said he has personally stopped about 25 performances by the likes of Oasis, the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Eminem. WHY AREN'T PEOPLE CALLING THIS A STAMPEDE?Professionals don't use the words "stampede'' or "panic" to describe such scenarios because that can put the blame for the deaths on the people in the crowd. Instead, they more often point at the event's organizers for failing to provide a safe environment. "Safety has no profit,'' Still said, "so it tends to be the last thing in the budget."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/explainer-here-is-why-crowd-surges-can-kill-people/articleshow/87563357.cms||---

---||Raipur||Chhattisgarh CM writes to PM Modi to include 'CG TEEKA' vax data on CoWin||RAIPUR: The Chhattisgarh government has requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to include the state's vaccination data - uploaded on its own 'CG TEEKA' portal - in CoWin. The Centre has not taken into account over 12.3 lakh Covid vaccine doses administered in Chhattisgarh, which were recorded on its own TEEKA portal in the initial days. Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel has written to PM Modi so that the data may reflect on the CoWin app and portal. Before the Centre began allotting vaccines free of cost to all states, the Chhattisgarh government procured vaccines on its own expense for the 18-44 age group and launched its CG TEEKA portal on May 1, 2021, instead of using CoWIN, the portal floated by the Centre for vaccination. During this period, the state government issued vaccine certificates with Baghel's photograph, just as CoWin certificates carry the PM's image. Many non-BJP states had started issuing their own vaccine certificates, with the photograph of their respective chief ministers, on the ground that if they were procuring vaccines on their own budget, so they could issue customized vaccine certificates as well. On June 21, the Centre began supplying vaccines for free to all states, and the Chhattisgarh government discontinued its own vaccine drive on CG TEEKA. However, during the one and half months TEEKA was in operation, 12,02,435 people took their first dose and 28,932 their second dose. Baghel has requested that this data be included in CoWin. In addition to this, the state has administered more than 1.6 crore first doses - accounting for 80% - and around 73 lakh second doses of the vaccine. The state government says its vaccine coverage is higher than national average.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/chhattisgarh-cm-writes-to-pm-modi-to-include-cg-teeka-vax-data-on-cowin/articleshow/87563456.cms||---
---||World||Pakistan opposition seeks public opinion to oust Imran Khan govt||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Vice-President Maryam Nawaz Sharif has sought public opinion on what "extreme and effective" measures the Pakistan Democratic Alliance (PDM) could take to throw Imran Khan government out of power, reported a local media. The timing of the move is interesting as it came at a time when the anti-government alliance is devising the strategy to make the most of the rising public sentiments against the rising inflation in the country due to inflation, reported The Express Tribune. Taking to Twitter, Maryam said, "The PDM and the PML-N want to interpret the feelings of the people and cure their sufferings and want to stand by you in your hour of need and be your voice," reported Tribune. "What do you think should be our most effective and extreme measure in this regard," she further wrote. Taking a jibe at the Imran Khan government, Maryam said that only those who do not know the plight of the government could say something like what the government said, according to Tribune. "Just ask the people if they want Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan of 2017 or your Pakistan of poverty, inflation, unemployment, unrest, terrorism and starvation," she further questioned. Maryam said that the Imran Khan government has made Pakistan the "most backward country" in the region in "every field". "When the heart of the ruler has deprived of the sympathy for people then this stubbornness [by the government] becomes visible," Tribune reported Maryam as stating in her tweet. Meanwhile, the alliance of major opposition parties, PDM on Saturday decided to hold 'mehngai' march in provincial capitals before going ahead with a long march towards Islamabad. This came after the PDM held a meeting to discuss the strategy of the alliance for a joint sitting of the Parliament on November 10 and rising inflation, ARY News reported. The parties informed that the rallies against the government over rising inflation would be held in Karachi, Quetta, Lahore and Peshawar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistan-opposition-seeks-public-opinion-to-oust-imran-khan-govt/articleshow/87563517.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Speeding car mows down cyclist, injures 6 pedestrians at Chingrighata||Kolkata: A cyclist was killed and six pedestrians were injured when a car owned by a Salt Lake-based veterinarian, in a hurry to cross the Chingrighata crossing around 4pm on Saturday even as the green signal turned yellow, hit an ambulance, the cyclist and then tried to make an abrupt U-turn hitting six other pedestrians. The car finally got stuck in a median curve. The cyclist, Toufik Ahmed, a resident of East Midnapore’s Kolaghat, died before he could be taken to a private hospital off Bypass. The veterinarian’s husband, Chirotosh Roy (53), who was at the wheels, has been arrested for rash driving, causing death due to negligence and causing grievous hurt among others. All offences are bailable. He will be produced in a Salt Lake court on Sunday, police said.. According to sources, the car was headed north along EM Bypass, possibly to the couple’s Salt Lake Sector I home from their Keyatala Road-based pet clinic and referral centre. The couple owns another such centre in Kankurgachhi. Though the car had a driver, it was Roy who was driving with the driver sitting next to him. Roy’s wife was in the rear seat. The signal was green when the car approached Chingrighata crossing. It turned yellow when the car tried to cross it. Police said Roy didn’t stop the car neither did he slow it down. Ahmed, on seeing the yellow signal, had just about pulled his cycle a few feet on the road — at the crossing with South Canal East Road, said witnesses. Roy first hit the ambulance ahead of his car and then swerved to where Ahmed and others were waiting for red signal. The car hit Ahmed and tried to take a U-turn abruptly. By then the signal had turned red and pedestrians had started crossing over. The car hit six others, including a woman, before getting stuck in a median curve. One of the pedestrians is said to be critical. “All seven injured persons were taken to hospital where one of them succumbed to death. We have arrested the driver and seized the offending vehicle. All legal formalities are in process,” said Surya Prasad Yadav, DC headquarters, Bidhannagar Commissionerate. Attempts to speak to the Roy family failed. It is learnt that the couple had been running their clinic and pet shops in south Kolkata and Kankurgachhi for several years. The couple in their late 40s are known faces among city’s pet lovers. A person who knows them said their cars are usually driven by drivers. A source said they were also not sure if Roy had just learnt driving. Police said the offending vehicle has been sent for forensic and mechanical tests. Bhola Das, who was treated for head injuries, said, “We saw the car hitting the ambulance first. All I remember after that was something hit me and police were taking me to hospital.” Arup Doloi, who was hit on his head and left leg, said, “More people could have been hit.” Inputs by Dwaipayan Ghosh, Tamaghna Banerjee, Mayukh Sengupta & Amit Moulick||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/speeding-car-mows-down-cyclist-injures-6-pedestrians-at-chingrighata/articleshow/87559904.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

These villages also fear the people will become sterile and die after two to three years of taking the vaccine. The second dose coverage on Saturday was 16% in Kiphire as little progress could be made in the first dose of vaccination. "In our religion, 666 or the sign of the beast is anti-Christ. People are spreading the rumour that this is not a vaccine but they are injecting microchips of 666," said Dr K Pewezo Khalo, district immunization officer, Kiphire. He said that the lower literacy rate in the district complicated the hesitancy factor further. "Not only unlettered people, even some educated people have developed vaccine hesitancy," he said. Khalo added that misbelief has been spreading since January. Except for doctors and nurses, he said even a section of health auxiliary staff stayed away from the vaccine. "We are translating the facts about Covid vaccine in local dialects and circulating the messages of public leaders and noted citizens through social media," he said. In the monsoon season, many villagers in the difficult hilly terrain could not be approached. Inhabitants of Sangtam, Sumi and Yimkhiung tribes are the major tribes in Kiphire.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kohima/social-media-rumours-keep-christians-away-from-vaccine-in-nagaland-district/articleshow/87563640.cms||Kangkan Kalita

More than 15.77 (15,77,70,771) crore balance and unutilised vaccine doses are still available with the states and UTs to be administered, it said. The Union government is committed to accelerating the pace and expanding the scope of Covid-19 vaccination throughout the country, it added. As part of the nationwide vaccination drive, the government of India has been supporting the states and UTs by providing them Covid vaccines free of cost. In the new phase of the universalisation of the Covid-19 vaccination drive, the Union government will procure and supply (free of cost) 75% of the vaccines being produced by the vaccine manufacturers in the country to states and UTs, the ministry said. The new phase of universalisation of Covid-19 vaccination commenced on June 21, 2021. The vaccination drive has been ramped up through the availability of more vaccines, advanced visibility of vaccine availability to states and UTs for enabling better planning by them, and streamlining the vaccine supply chain, the ministry added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/over-116-58-crore-covid-19-vaccine-doses-provided-to-states-union-territories-so-far/articleshow/87563639.cms||---

The ‘lucky’ customer was Meenangadi native Midhun Babu, a project coordinator with the Brahmagiri Development Society. Midhun says that he has been getting calls from his friends ever since the incident, either to enquire about it or simply to prank him over it. Midhun had ordered the wallet on October 30. He got the parcel containing the wallet with the passport inside in a sealed cover November 1. Midhun says that he was taken aback and sought help from his friends on how to deal with it. “I tried to talk to the customer care centre of the online company but they were not helpful. I told a friend of mine who works with Doordarshan and he connected me with a vernacular media. After a report about the incident appeared, the owner of the passport tracked me down and gave me a call. The owner said that he didn’t know what actually happened and was looking for the passport at his home all this while. Later, a TV channel picked up the story and their video report went viral,” said Midhun. He said that he came across memes made on the incident. “Friends have been calling to ask about it. Some even call asking for help in ‘ordering’ a passport as a prank. Someone else wanted me to order a phone for them. Most were friends trying to pull-off a prank,” said Midhun. The passport was in-fact misplaced in the wallet by another person who had bought and returned the wallet from the online e-commerce platform. The passport is now at the Meenangadi police station from where the original owner would collect it. A senior officer with Meenangadi police said that the passport belonged to a teenager from Thrissur. “The wallet was returned as the customer was not satisfied with it. They however forgotten to take the passport out before returning the wallet. It seems like the online seller repacked the wallet without opening it and delivered it to the person residing in our limits. He promptly surrendered it before us, and we have informed the owner. They sent a person to collect it, but we can only give it to the owner directly. We have asked him to come with his identification documents,” said the officer, adding that they were treating it as a case of a lost and found passport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/kerala-youth-orders-wallet-online-gets-passport-as-bonus/articleshow/87563691.cms||---

The four lawyers had recently addressed a press conference and released a "fact-finding" report, "Humanity under Attack in Tripura, Muslim Lives Matter". They alleged that 12 mosques, nine shops and three houses belonging to the minority community in Tripura were vandalised by Hindutva groups during protests against attacks on members of Hindus community in Bangladesh. The SFI leaders here threatened to launch a mass movement across the country against the Tripura government unless police withdrew the notice and "stopped stifling people's freedom to express their views independently". Criticising the Biplab Kumar Deb-led BJP-IPFT government, the protesters alleged, "Freedom of speech and personal liberty have been snatched away during this regime. Police are harassing journalists, media and individuals for posting comments on social media." According to CPI-M leaders in Tripura, the four lawyers had visited different locations of the state after communal tension hit Panisagar of North Tripura on October 26, during which houses, shops and a mosque belonging to the minority community were attacked by VHP members during a rally. The incident wedged a rift between two communities across the state, but police did not take any strong action against the offenders, they added. However, Tripura police denied the allegations and claimed that minor scuffles took place in the state, and that there was no attack on any mosque. Police alleged that the lawyers have distorted facts to fan communal hatred through social media posts. A case has been registered against the four Supreme Court lawyers Ehtesham Hashmi, Member of Lawyers for Democracy Advocate Amit Srivastava, National Confederation of Human Rights Organisation's national secretary Ansar Indori and Member of Peoples' Union of Civil Liberties Mukesh Kumar. They have been asked by the Tripura Police to appear before them for the investigation by November 10. The Superintendent of Police (West Tripura) Manik Das said the lawyers were served notice on Thursday to verify some social media posts that appeared on their social media accounts, where they expressed discontent regarding the recent communal incidents with false facts and distorted information. The lawyers had also demanded the constitution of an inquiry committee, headed by a retired High Court judge, to investigate the alleged attack on Muslims, compensation to victims, reparation of damaged religious places, among others. They had also demanded strict action against people and organisations who had made provocative and false posts on social media to incite people. Meanwhile,Tripura Police registered 11 cases - four in North Tripura, three in West Tripura, one in Gomati district and three cases in Sepahijala district - for allegedly instigating communal violence and arrested eight people for alleged rumour mongering.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agartala/stir-in-delhi-as-sc-lawyers-booked-under-uapa-over-tripura-tension/articleshow/87563681.cms||Biswendu Bhattacharjee

Their power supplier has just announced it is doubling its electricity prices, while property prices are looking "rather scary".  "We don't know where this is going to lead us," Simon Wendland told AFP.  From energy and food, to paper and rent, prices have been marching mercilessly higher both in Germany and across Europe.  Latest data put inflation in Europe's biggest economy at five percent year-on-year, a level not seen in the last 30 years.  Bild, the country's biggest-selling newspaper, blames the European Central Bank for failing to rein in prices and even adding to the problem with its cheap money policy.  The Frankfurt-based ECB has argued that its record-low interest rates and 1.85-trillion-euro ($2.15-trillion) pandemic emergency bond-buying programme are necessary to prop up an economy ravaged by the coronavirus crisis.  In Germany, however, savers believe the ECB's zero-interest-rate policy is eating away at the value of their assets.  Bild recently branded ECB chief Christine Lagarde as "Madame Inflation", saying she "wears Chanel clothes" but "mocks the fate of pensioners, employees and savers", even if the central bank president has herself expressed concern about the rising price of basic foodstuffs in supermarkets. With its ultra-loose monetary policy of recent years, the ECB has long been a bugbear for Germany's savers.  Bild had nicknamed Lagarde's predecessor Mario Draghi "Draghila", comparing him to a vampire "sucking our accounts to the last drop".  After the devastation wrought by the inflationary crises of the 1920s and 1970s, Germans have an ingrained fear of inflation, said ING economist Carsten Brzeski.  Lagarde's repeated assertion that recent price surges are transitional is met with disbelief in Europe's most populous country.  "According to Madame Lagarde, we will have overcome all that by the middle of next year, but that's just what she says," said Marlott Kroeber, a 72-year-old former teacher.  German bankers, too, have voiced scepticism about Lagarde's assessment.  "There are more and more indications that this price surge is not temporary and we will have to live with it beyond this year," said Commerzbank chief Manfred Knof.  Christian Sewing, his counterpart at Deutsche Bank, has similarly urged central banks to "find a way to exit their very accomodative monetary policy," and the "sooner the better".  - Last defender - Germany's central bank chief Jens Weidmann recently dropped a bombshell by announcing his resignation from the powerful Bundesbank at the end of this year.  Weidmann, who has headed the Bundesbank for a decade, was often seen as a lone voice against the ECB's ultra-loose policy.  So with him leaving, "the last defender of the German saver has given up," said Die Welt newspaper in a tribute to the central banker.  Nevertheless, analysts argue that the ECB has safeguarded the eurozone's prosperity with its policies.  Critics forget "that the institution has also ensured that the economy continues to be given support, that the eurozone is maintained and the German job market sees a boom" not seen in 20 years, said Brzeski.  Employees have also been able to benefit from a strong economy while the state has been able to take out loans at negative rates.  Some consumers are therefore still in the camp of the ECB.  Pensioner Hermann Vogt for one believes that the central bank is "doing mostly what is necessary" in the interests of the 19-nation zone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/soaring-prices-fuel-anti-ecb-sentiment-in-germany/articleshow/87563742.cms||---

The data from the world's second-largest economy also suggested that Chinese factories had kept the goods flowing out despite power outages in recent months caused by emission reduction targets, the surging price of coal, and supply shortages. The government said last week that the power crisis was winding down thanks to a boost in domestic coal output. Exports rose a better-than-expected 27.1 percent on-year in October, according to customs authorities, to $300.2 billion. Imports came in slightly below analyst estimates, rising 20.6 percent in October. In recent months, several Chinese factories were forced to halt operations due to power outages, raising concerns about global supply chains. The squeeze had worsened as China's Covid-19 border restrictions hindered shipments of raw materials from overseas while a trade tiff with Australia exacerbated the drop in coal imports.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/chinese-exports-solid-in-october-as-covid-eases-overseas/articleshow/87563745.cms||---
---||India||Can South Asia combat climate crisis, we believe yes: SAPAN||BATHINDA: The South Asia Peace Action Network (SAPAN), in a virtual session held recently, raised its voice for concerted efforts to combat the climate crisis in South Asia. Noted environmentalists and climate activists from across South Asia put up their views as to how collective efforts are needed to face and battle out the crisis which is taking a big toll across the world. It was felt that though activism against their governments and world powers is being witnessed in European Nations where it is being stressed that climate crisis is fast turning into climate emergency which need quick and real actions to battle it but not such efforts are being seen in South Asia which too is facing the impact of the crisis. It was stressed that collective efforts are needed to reach out to the governments to take drastic measures to combat the climate crisis. A resolution was adopted at the meet which was endorsed by participants. The resolution put by young climate activist Disha Ravi from India and Durlabh Ashok from Pakistan stated that distressed that the governments in South Asia have not collaborated to present a united position at COP-26 in Glasgow, we the participants of this discussion on combating the climate crisis in South Asia, resolve that: World leaders at COP26 must pay heed to the challenges faced by South Asia, a region home to a quarter of humanity. Countries that have been the biggest polluters must bear the onus on action regarding emissions reductions. The development trajectories of billions who seek to be lifted out of poverty and deprivation must not be in contradiction to their aspirations. We urge governments to roll back reliance on fossil fuels as a contributor to growth and wealth generation. The Global North must commit the finance and technology transfer promised to the nations of the Global South to enable unified action towards limiting the rise of global temperature below 1.5 degrees. We will continue urging our governments to keep channels of communication and cooperation open between the South Asian nations to seek solutions to challenges posed by climate change. We express our solidarity with the peoples of South Asia who are facing the climate crisis together. We await similar cooperative actions from the governments, shedding their divisive policies. South Asian nations must consider our fragile ecosystems and shrinking habitats a shared responsibility and preserve, promote and scale the indigenous knowledge of our communities that can provide crucial solutions in fighting the impacts of climate change. We will continue to urge our governments to promote the exchange of knowledge and information about meteorological phenomena, and disaster risks. We see key issues like glacial melt, sea level rise, rising heat vis-a-vis urban resilience, air quality and water resource management as regional issues. Urge our nations to view these issues as such and take a regional approach towards them. We believe cooperation on species’ protection, natural resource protection and climate justice for climate migrants, indigenous people communities, and other vulnerable groups must transcend boundaries. We will continue to support and encourage advocacy and activism to engage with decision-makers to ensure that cooperative protocols that have been developed are not rolled back. Voices raised in unison from South Asia must be heard and heeded at global forums like the COP26. The human capital of the South Asian region has the potential to lead us towards climate sanity. We urge our governments to collaborate towards this. The world needs to provide leverage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/can-south-asia-combat-climate-crisis-we-believe-yes-sapan/articleshow/87563788.cms||Neel Kamal

"I'm absolutely devastated by what took place last night. My prayers go out to the families and all those impacted by what happened at the Astroworld Festival," Scott's statement on social media read. Meanwhile, the city's mayor said two children, aged 14 and 16, were among the eight people who died at American rapper Scott's Astroworld music festival in Houston on Friday night. The other victims were in the age group of 21 to 27, Houston mayor Sylvester Turner said at a press conference. Among the injured is a 10-year-old who is in a critical condition, Houston Police chief Troy Finner said. Scott, an eight-time Grammy-nominated artiste who is hugely popular among young adults, was performing at NRG Park, when the crowd began to push toward the stage and the tragedy happened. Scott added in his statement: "Houston PD has my total support as they continue to look into the tragic loss of life. I am committed to working together with the Houston community to heal and support the families in need." Multiple reports from attendees collated by 'Variety' from its own investigations and media reports, however, allege that security and emergency workers were difficult to find and at times unresponsive during the chaotic scenes at NRG Park. The crowd, in fact, was already rambunctious, with many concertgoers seemingly inebriated. The first reports that people were falling down and had been injured came around 9.30 pm local time. The festival stopped at 10.10 pm. Some people were trampled in the crush of fans in front of the stage. Around 50,000 people were in attendance. Summing up the dangers imminent in the post-Covid return to normality, 'Variety' noted: "As the concert world has cautiously returned from 18 months of pandemic lockdown, festivals have been a major force in that comeback, both for fans and promoters. Yet the tragedy at Travis Scott's Astroworld festival... showed just how quickly disaster can occur." The sentiments of the community were articulated by Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, who said: "This is an artiste that we know has a following among young people in particular, young people with bright futures." She added that the ages of the victims "just breaks your heart". Houston is in Harris County, Texas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/absolutely-devastated-travis-scott-a-day-after-concert-tragedy/articleshow/87563795.cms||---

A few paddy procurement centres have opened, but as many others are yet to open, farmers are becoming restless. On Friday, a farmer in Kamareddy district died while sleeping near his paddy produce at a procurement centre. Officials have been requesting farmers not to reap their harvest and that they should do so on getting the required tokens so that the procurement can happen in a systematic manner. With a limited number of tokens being given, farmers, who have already harvested their produce, were complaining that they were being made to wait. “It is the central government which has to come out and clearly say whether FCI will procure paddy produce in the next season or not,” panchayat raj minister E Dayakar Rao said on Saturday when he went to inaugurate procurement centres in Jangaon district. The minister said this as he was asked by farmers about the next crop procurement. In Nalgonda district, collector Prashant Patil visited a procurement centre to check the system of tokens at Vemulapalli Rythu Vedika office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tokens-fail-to-cut-wait-time-at-paddy-centres-in-telangana/articleshow/87563787.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The artistes took to agriculture after the Covid-19 pandemic rendered them jobless. Paddy grown at Kolekady village in Athikaribettu gram panchayat, 40km from Mangaluru, is ready for harvest, and artistes will hold a harvest celebration on Sunday. Suresh Kolekady, patron of Yaksha Mithraru, said the crop was cultivated using traditional methods to promote agriculture under the theme ‘Bennid ben kuldu thin’ (work hard in the field, stay content). “No machines were used,” Kolekady said. “We want to motivate the younger generation to cultivate crops using traditional methods. Yakshagana troupes have suffered badly due to Covid-19 restrictions and lockdowns. This is the second year we have been involved in agriculture. Six of our members left for jobs in foreign countries and the others decided to take to farming.” He said the artistes cultivated paddy on land belonging to Mahabala Kundar and Bhaskar Bangera in Kolekady village. “We will harvest paddy in the presence of dignitaries from the village. No machinery has been used for cultivation, and harvesting will also be done in a traditional manner, using sickles,” he said. On the yield, Kolekady said they expect nearly 12 ‘mudis’ (one ‘mudi’ is approximately 40kg) rice. “About 30 artistes helped cultivate paddy on about one acre of land,” he said. “We plan to distribute the yield among families of poor artistes. There are many senior yakshagana artistes who have not earned anything other than fame in life. So Yaksha Mithra will help them through various initiatives. After the harvest, we complete the remaining processes on Sunday,” he said, adding artistes had cultivated paddy at a field in Kelpady village near Mulky last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/karnataka-yakshagana-artistes-set-to-reap-paddy-they-sowed-during-pandemic-induced-lockdown/articleshow/87563895.cms||Vinobha K T

Crores of rupees have been invested into providing a systematic approach to public transport so far. “A total disregard for basic road safety and transportation rule, has meant that bus drivers can hold traffic hostage whenever, they want.

---||World||Iraq PM calls for calm after drone attack on his residence||BAGHDAD: Iraq's Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi said he was unhurt and appealed for "calm and restraint" after a drone attack on his residence early on Sunday as political tensions mounted in the country. The attack in Baghdad's Green Zone was the first to target the residence of Kadhemi, who has been in power since May 2020, and came as Iraq's political parties wrangle over who will run the next government after elections last month. That vote saw the Conquest (Fatah) Alliance, the political arm of the pro-Iran Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary network, suffer a substantial decline in its parliamentary seats, leading the group to denounce the outcome as "fraud". No group has yet claimed responsibility for Sunday's attack, which left two bodyguards injured, according to a security source. In a tweet, Kadhemi called "for calm and restraint on the part of everyone for the good of Iraq". "My residence has been the target of cowardly assault. Praise God, I am fine and so are those who work with me," he then said in a short video shared on social media. "Cowardly missiles and drones don't build nations." Kadhemi's office described the attack as a "failed assassination attempt". The United States swiftly condemned the attack and said it was "relieved to learn the Prime Minister was unharmed". "This apparent act of terrorism, which we strongly condemn, was directed at the heart of the Iraqi state," state department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement. "We are in close touch with the Iraqi security forces charged with upholding Iraq's sovereignty and independence and have offered our assistance as they investigate this attack." A large number of security forces were deployed in and around the heavily guarded Green Zone, which also hosts the US embassy and is frequently targeted by rocket attacks. On October 31, three rockets fell in Mansour, a neighbouring district, without causing any injuries. The attack came during a period of soaring tensions over the results of the October 10 elections. Hundreds of Hashed supporters clashed with police on Friday while protesting near the Green Zone to vent their fury over the result. One protestor died of their injuries in hospital, according to a security source, while a Hashed source said two demonstrators were killed. The health ministry reported 125 injuries, most of them from the security forces. Several hundred supporters of pro-Iranian groups returned to the Green Zone on Saturday to protest. Some burned a portrait of the Prime Minister, whom they called a "criminal". According to preliminary tallies, the Conquest won around 15 of the 329 seats in parliament last month, down from the 48 it held previously, which made it the second-largest bloc. The big winner this time, with more than 70 seats according to the initial count, was the movement of Moqtada Sadr, a Shiite Muslim preacher who campaigned as a nationalist and critic of Iran. Final election results are expected within weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/iraq-pm-calls-for-calm-after-drone-attack-on-his-residence/articleshow/87564010.cms||---

The proposed symbolic move gains importance as the government has put focus on modernization of Indian Railways and has projected the indigenous semi-high speed train as the sign of changing face of the national transporter. Currently, a Fairy Queen locomotive is placed in front of the Rail Bhawan, which is the headquarters of the Indian Railways. The Fairy Queen locomotive had made it to the Guiness Book of Records as the world’s oldest steam locomotive in regular service. Sources said the Integral Coach Factory at Chennai, which manufactured the first two Vande Bharat trainsets, is finalizing the replica of the trainset that would be put in the Rail Bhawan complex. “The Vande Bharat trainsets signify the transformational changes happening in the railways in respect of quality ride, comfort, adoption of modern technology and speed of travel. So, there is more focus to manufacture and roll out more such trains,” said a senior official. Vande Bharat trains are equipped with upgraded amenities as well as better seating, security, and surveillance systems along with fire-proof features. The next generation of these trains will have more modern features. The government has prioritized the operation of 75 Vande Bharat trainsets connecting major cities by August 2023, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced in his Independence Day speech. Sources said even the trains that private operators would bring in future would be trainsets, which don’t require a separate locomotive to run the train as these are self propelled. The first Vande Bharat trainset was flagged off by the PM in February 2019 between Delhi and Varanasi. The second train runs between Delhi and Katra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/vande-bharat-train-replica-may-replace-fairy-queen-steam-engine-at-rail-bhawan/articleshow/87564015.cms||Dipak K Dash
