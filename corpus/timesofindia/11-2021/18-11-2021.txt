The law brings into effect the 2019 judgment of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which asked Pakistan to give India consular access to Jadhav and also provide him right of review and reconsideration against his conviction and sentence. The ICJ gave its judgment on July 17, 2019. However, no progress has been made on the review issue as India refused to appoint a local lawyer while demanding Pakistan to let an Indian lawyer represent Jadhav in the court. Despite Pakistan’s parliament passing the bill, the issue is likely to remain deadlocked till Islamabad allows New Delhi to appoint a lawyer of its choice to represent Jadhav. Pakistan has been alleging that India is engaging in a campaign to obfuscate the issue of appointing a lawyer to represent Jadhav. The ICJ (Review and Re-consideration) Bill, 2020, was moved by Pakistan’s law minister Farogh Nasim and passed with a majority vote. The statement of objects and reasons of the bill stated that the government of India had initiated proceedings against Pakistan in the ICJ concerning alleged violations of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations in the matter of the detention and trial of Jadhav, who was sentenced to death in April 2017 for espionage. In order to give full effect to the said judgment, according to the bill, it is necessary that a mechanism for review and reconsideration of Pakistan’s own choice be provided. The bill providing Jadhav the right to appeal against his conviction was passed by the National Assembly in June this year. However, it failed to get the nod of the Senate. A joint session of the parliament is called when the differences between the two Houses are unbridgeable. While the ruling coalition led by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf has a majority in the National Assembly, it does not have the numbers in the Upper House. Jadhav, according to Pakistan, was arrested on March 3, 2016, from Balochistan’s Mashkhel area. New Delhi, however, claimed that he was a retired Indian Navy officer and was abducted by Pakistani operators from Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running his business. His appeals against his conviction had been rejected by the military’s court of appeal. On India’s appeal, the ICJ had stopped Pakistan from carrying out the capital punishment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistan-parliament-passes-bill-giving-jadhav-right-to-file-review-appeal-against-conviction/articleshow/87766847.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

---||World||Allegations that Mountbatten influenced India-Pakistan boundary at Partition raised in London tribunal||LONDON: A question mark has been raised at a tribunal in London over the impartiality of Lord Mountbatten and whether he sought to interfere with the boundary drawn between India and Pakistan at Partition. The allegations were made during a first-tier tribunal (information rights) hearing as to whether all the private diaries of and correspondence between Lord and Lady Mountbatten — held by the University of Southampton within the Broadlands archives — should be made public. Clara Hamer, representing British author Andrew Lownie, who has written a book on the Mountbattens and is seeking full disclosure of the Mountbatten papers, told the tribunal that Lord Mountbatten’s diary entry on July 12, 1947 reveals that he had dinner with British judge Sir Cyril Radcliffe, the chair of the Boundary Commission, and Christopher Beaumont, its secretary, but his diary entry from the day after has been redacted on the basis that it could prejudice the UK’s relations with India and Pakistan. Hamer said: "The issue of whether Mountbatten was impartial and the fact he met with Radcliffe and Beaumont on that date is a matter of importance as this was a time he was not supposed to be having contact with them and this could be evidence of a lack of impartiality by Lord Mountbatten. I would want to ask whether what is redacted on July 13, 1947 is linked to dinner the night before and is to do with drawing up of the boundary of Pakistan. And, if it is, there is a very strong public interest in full transparency on that issue." Hamer also questioned why Mountbatten’s diary entry from August 6, 1947 — one week before Independence — has been redacted. "This would be of particular public interest and importance for historians wishing to understand events at the time of independence," she said. She said Lownie had taken an educated guess that that was a meeting of the joint defence council, which Mountbatten would have attended. On Wednesday retired archivist and curator at the University of Southampton Library, Professor Chris Woolgar, defended his decision to alert the Cabinet Office to "highly sensitive" materials within the Mountbatten papers, which were about the royal family or were related to India and Pakistan, which he spotted after receiving them, which led to them being closed off. The tribunal heard that the Cabinet Office responded to his email within three hours agreeing certain files should be closed, saying, "The material relating to India and Pakistan is especially sensitive from this period." The Broadlands Archive, made up of 4,500 boxes, which include 47 volumes of Lord Mountbatten’s diaries and 36 volumes of Lady Mountbatten’s diaries, was held at Broadlands House, the Mountbatten family estate near Romsey, and was transferred to the university in more than eight lorries between the 1980s and 2010. In 2011, the university purchased the Broadlands Archive from the trustees using several million pounds of public money. Lownie is also seeking disclosure of correspondence between Lady Mountbatten and Jawaharlal Nehru, which is also in storage at Southampton, but Southampton says it does not own it and is simply storing it, even though it has an option to purchase them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/allegations-that-mountbatten-influenced-india-pakistan-boundary-at-partition-raised-in-london-tribunal/articleshow/87766899.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||India||Resignations in Jammu and Kashmir Congress over party unit chief||JAMMU/SRINAGAR: Four former ministers and three ex-legislators of Congress in Jammu and Kashmir were among several senior members to resign on Wednesday from party posts, alleging that their suggestions and opinion on party affairs were seldom sought or heard. They are said to be close to Ghulam Nabi Azad, the former leader of the opposition in Rajya Sabha, who is among 23 top Congress politicians to make similar allegations in a letter to the party leadership last year. They held Congress’s J&K unit chief GA Mir responsible for the crisis and wrote in their resignation letter that the 'hostile attitude' of the party leadership in the Union territory compelled them to step down from all party posts. For his part, Mir said he has not received any resignation and those members “are not holding any position in the party” other than being legislators in the past. He said they have never communicated their resentment, either to Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi when they met him in Jammu last month or to AICC’s state in-charge Rajni Patil. Mir called the latest political drama a conspiracy by “some top Delhi-based Congress leader” trying to blackmail the high command for an important position in the party. The prominent names from Wednesday’s resignations include GM Saroori, Jugal Kishore Sharma, Waqar Rasool, Dr Manohar Lal Sharma, Ghulam Nabi Monga, Naresh Gupta, Subash Gupta, Amin Bhat, Anwar Bhat and Inayat Ali. They said Congress high command was informed several times that Mir “doesn’t carry the desired respect and reputation for this coveted post”, but no action was taken. According to sources a request to remove him was presented to Rahul Gandhi during his Jammu visit, but it was not taken seriously. They said more than 200 top Congress members, including former ministers, MLAs, MLCs, PCC office bearers, district presidents and AICC functionaries, have quit and joined other parties over the past several months. Reacting to the mass resignation in Congress, former deputy chief minister Kavinder Gupta of BJP said the party in J&K will collapse because of infighting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/resignations-in-jammu-and-kashmir-congress-over-party-unit-chief/articleshow/87766957.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||World||Overseas Pakistanis get voting rights as Pakistan parliament passes new law||ISLAMABAD: Amid strong protests by the opposition, the Imran Khan-led coalition government in Pakistan managed to bulldoze amendments to the Elections Act, 2017 in the joint session of parliament on Wednesday, thereby allowing the use of electronic voting machines (EVMs) and granting voting rights to overseas Pakistanis. In protest, the opposition tore copies of the agenda and staged a walkout, chanting slogans against the PM and his government. The opposition and treasury members almost came to blows when the former tried to stop the proceedings of the joint session. Imran’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) is considered to be the sole beneficiary if overseas Pakistanis are able to vote through internet. There are approximately 9 million Pakistanis living outside the country and the incumbent prime minister is said to very popular among them. The voting turnout of overseas nationals is also believed to be much higher than in Pakistan. “The new laws were passed to steal the next elections,” Jamaat-i-Islami chief Sirajul Haq said. At the start of the parliament session, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) president and leader of the opposition in the National Assembly, Shehbaz Sharif, termed EVMs “evil and vicious machines” and accused the government of not being sincere in creating a consensus on electoral reforms. Sharif claimed that the “selected government” wanted to introduce EVMs because it can no longer ask the people for votes. “There are always allegations of rigging during the elections. This is the first time in history that there are allegations of rigging before the elections,” he said. Pakistan Peoples Party chief Bilwal Bhutto Zardari said it was the first time in the history of Pakistan that a government tried to bring “unilateral” electoral reforms. Speaking about the EVM, he said even the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has rejected it after raising serious objections over the machine. He said the PPP will challenge the new laws in the Supreme Court. The ECP had earlier referred to various issues linked with the use of EVM, including lack of ballot secrecy, lack of capacity at all levels and lack of ensuring security and chain of custody for the machines at rest and during transportation. It also pointed out that there would be no evidence available in case of election dispute. The ECP had noted that data integration and configuration issues may crop up due to court orders at the eleventh hour regarding a change in ballot paper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/overseas-pakistanis-get-voting-rights-as-pak-parliament-passes-new-law/articleshow/87767003.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||India||Farooq Abdullah demands impartial probe into Hyderpora civilian killings, Mehbooba says Kashmiris won’t surrender to oppression||SRINAGAR/JAMMU: While National Conference president and MP Farooq Abdullah telephoned J&K lieutenant-governor Manoj Sinha on Wednesday and demanded an impartial and time-bound inquiry into the Hyderpora encounter and the return of the bodies of the slain civilians to their kin, PDP president Mehbooba Mufti led a protest march in Jammu and said that only one militant was killed while the three others were civilians. Farooq Abbullah said the impact of such killings and the subsequent "culture of impunity" would have a depressing impact on the public psyche. "The contrasting versions of the killings have sent a wave of fear across Kashmir. Varying versions have raised misgivings among the people, particularly the bereaved families," Farooq Abdullah told the LG. "Apprehensions have been raised by the victims’ families on the veracity of claims made by the police and its investigative agencies. It is, therefore, incumbent upon the J&K administration to ensure that there was no foul play involved and ensure that the bereaved families’ version is heard and respected," he said. PDP president Mehbooba Mufti said in Jammu on Wednesday that Kashmiris had never surrendered at gunpoint and would not do so now. "Kashmiris won’t surrender by committing atrocities on them. The only solution to this issue is a dialogue with Kashmiris. Their issues need to addressed constitutionally, and not through oppression," she said. Mehbooba claimed that nobody knew whether or not a militant was slain in Hyderpora but it was clear that three civilians had been killed in the encounter. "They were innocent people whose families are urging the authorities to return their bodies. Their little kids are waiting for their fathers to come. A helper, a doctor and a businessman were killed, and now the authorities are not even returning their bodies to their families," she said. Referring to IGP (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar’s claim that they had digital evidence against those killed, she said, "If they had prior evidence, why did the police not arrest them, as they have been doing on a daily basis?" She added: "Whenever someone gets killed in firing, the police label them as OGWs. All their claims are false. The forces didn’t have any explanation to these killings so now they are labelling them as OGWs or militant associates and hybrid militants. All three were innocent people…" she said. Mehbooba, a former J&K CM, said since the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, or AFSPA, has been in force, there has been no accountability for the killing of innocents. Earlier, in February 2018, Mehbooba Mufti had ruled out the revocation of AFSPA and had said the Indian Army was the most disciplined force in the world. "This cruel government is not even handing over the bodies after killing people. They want to convert this nation of Gandhi, Nehru, and Ambedkar into a country of Godse. What else can I say," the PDP chief said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/farooq-abdullah-demands-impartial-probe-into-hyderpora-civilian-killings-mehbooba-says-kashmiris-wont-surrender-to-oppression/articleshow/87767049.cms||M Saleem Pandit

IGP (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar said TRF district commander Afaq Sikander was among the five slain terrorists. Three terrorists were killed in Pombai and two in Gopalpora, he said, in operations that were based on tip-offs from informers. The encounters were triggered on Wednesday afternoon when joint teams comprising police and CRPF personnel launched cordon-and-search operations in the two areas and the militants fired at the forces when they started closing in. The Pombai gunfight began first and the terrorists killed there had not yet been identified. The TRF’s Afaq Sikander was among the two terrorists killed in the Gopalpura area, Kumar said. The police and CRPF, meanwhile, arrested two men linked to the Lashker-e-Taiba in south Kashmir's Pulwama district and recovered IEDs from them. A police statement said the two terrorist associates were identified as Amir Bashir Dar of Sirnoo, in Pulwama, and Mukhtar Ahmad Bhat of Matri Bugh, Shopian. In a third incident on Wednesday, two CRPF men and two civilians were injured when terrorists threw a hand grenade at Palhalan chowk, in north Kashmir's Baramulla district. All the injured were shifted to a nearby hospital for treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/five-terrorists-including-district-trf-commander-killed-in-twin-encounters-in-kulgam/articleshow/87767101.cms||M Saleem Pandit

---||India||Recurrent pollution crisis is due to inertia of officials: SC||NEW DELHI: In a severe indictment of the officialdom, the Supreme Court on Wednesday said the recurring problem of pollution in Delhi and NCR is mainly because bureaucracy has developed inertia, wanting the courts to douse farm fires and curb polluting industries, rather than take adequate measures round the year to rein in major sources of pollutants, such as industries, vehicles and dust. A bench of Chief Justice NV Ramana and Justices DY Chandrachud and Surya Kant ordered strict implementation of the slew of decisions taken on Tuesday at the court-ordered emergency meeting of the Commission on Air Quality Management in NCR and adjoining areas, involving senior officials of the Centre and governments of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. Recounting his two-decade-long experience with bureaucracy while functioning as a constitutional court judge, and previously as advocate general of Andhra Pradesh, CJI Ramana said, “In general, over a period of time, what I have observed is both at the Centre and in states, the bureaucracy has developed an inexplicable inertia and apathy. They don’t want to take any decision. (In the pollution case) they want the courts to pick up buckets of water and douse the farm fires. They want the courts to catch polluting vehicles and industries. All these things the courts have to do. This is the attitude developed by the executive.” When a reference to allegations of the Centre “misleading” the court on farm fires came up, the bench said it has stated all facts in its affidavit and did not misrepresent matters. The CJI said, “It is common sense that farm fires in two months every year increase pollution levels in Delhi and NCR. We understand the plight of the farmers and do not want to penalise them. Yet, we have asked the state governments concerned to persuade the farmers not to burn stubble for two weeks. There is no point in raising the issue of farm fires again and again.” The court wondered why the executive is waiting for a court order to call for the emergency meeting: “Why were these decisions not taken earlier by the executive? Why does the Supreme Court have to set an agenda, force officials of the Centre and states to meet, and take emergent steps to curb pollution? “On Tuesday, the meeting took place. Why can’t the officers summarise the minutes of the meeting and clearly inform the court — these are things which have been decided, these have been implemented, these are the other measures required to be taken and then specify what directions have been issued to achieve the target on the ground,” the CJI said. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said it is the solemn duty of the Centre and states and every official to earnestly take all steps to implement the decisions taken at the meeting of the Commission. When this failed to assuage the SC’s angst, Mehta attempted to lighten the mood by narrating a poignant yet humorous fictional account of how bureaucracy acts. But it was off-target. The CJI said, “It is unfortunate that the executive has come to this pass. The bureaucracy does not want to do anything. They do not want to pass any orders. All they want is — let the court prepare draft measures. Let the court pass orders. Once the Supreme Court passes an order, they will simply put their signature on executive order saying it is as per the directions of the SC.” The SG narrated another humorous story about bureaucracy and succeeded in stopping the torrent of caustic observations. He then detailed the decisions taken at the meeting before the bench. On Delhi, the bench questioned the AAP government on augmentation of road-sweeping machines. Senior advocate AM Singhvi said the municipal corporations have placed a requirement of 15 such machines and the Delhi government has agreed to release funds and procure these for municipal corporations immediately. “Delhi ticks 90% of the measures decided to be taken at the Tuesday meeting and is ready to do everything that is required for bringing down the pollution levels,” Singhvi said. The bench asked whether 15 more machines were enough to sweep 8,500km of roads in Delhi, which at present has 69 such machines. Singhvi said the government is ready to procure more machines as and when the demands are raised by civic bodies. However, he touched a raw nerve by blaming the farm fires while petitioner’s counsel Vikas Singh stressed that during the two winter months, farm fires contributed more than 40% towards the pollution in Delhi and accused the Centre of misleading the court by stating that it was only 4-10%. The solicitor general said he has stated all facts and mentioned farm fires contributing majorly during the two winter months but scientific studies indicate that on an annual basis, the contribution is 4%. Piggybacking on the SC’s “common sense” comment, the SG interjected in a lighter vein: “Common sense is like a deodorant. Those who do not use it, make others suffer.” The bench told the Delhi government and the petitioner, “If you persist with farm fires, it will force us to make comments and create a controversy which would completely derail the main issue — how to curb pollution from all major sources. What have you done to implement SC orders banning firecrackers? For the last 10 days, cracker bursting has been taking place in every area of Delhi and NCR. Can you say firecrackers do not cause pollution?” The SG said central government employees have not been asked to ‘work from home' as the number of vehicles used by them is minuscule. “Normalcy in work at central government offices has come back after a long hiatus caused by the pandemic. Asking employees to WFH would have a pan-India impact.” The Delhi government said it has adopted WFH policy for its employees. The bench suggested to the Centre that since there are a large number of colonies where most central government officials and personnel reside, the Centre could think of engaging buses to ferry them to and from office. The SG said the Centre would sincerely attempt to implement this suggestion of the court. The SG said that the Met department has predicted that the wind speed would pick up after November 21 and that pollution would get considerably reduced. The bench said, “When the executive and bureaucracy do not work, we have to depend on nature and God’s mercy.” It posted the matter for further hearing on November 24 for stock-taking of steps taken by the Centre and NCR states to bring down pollution levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/recurrent-pollution-crisis-is-due-to-inertia-of-officials-sc/articleshow/87767623.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||World||Steve Bannon pleads not guilty to Capitol riot probe charges||WASHINGTON: Former president Donald Trump advisor Steve Bannon entered a "not guilty" plea Wednesday after his arrest on charges of contempt of Congress for refusing to testify on the January 6 attack on the Capitol.  One day ahead of the first hearing scheduled in his case, Bannon entered the plea in a federal district court in Washington, without explaining the grounds for his plea.  In October Bannon rejected a subpoena to testify to the House special committee investigating the attack by hundreds of Trump supporters on the US legislature.  The House then referred the contempt charges to the Justice Department, where a grand jury reviewed the case and voted to indict him on two counts.  Investigators believe Bannon and other advisors to Trump could have information on links between the White House and the mob that invaded the Capitol, on the day it was due to certify Joe Biden as winner of the November 2020 presidential election.  Although he was not a White House employee or official Trump advisor, Bannon's attorneys said he was protected by presidential privilege and did not have to cooperate with the committee.  If convicted, each contempt charge could bring one month to one year in jail, and a fine of up to $100,000.  Bannon surrendered to the FBI on Monday and vowed to fight the case.  He accused President Joe Biden of having "ordered" the Justice Department to prosecute him.  "I'm never going to back down," he told reporters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/bannon-pleads-not-guilty-to-capitol-riot-probe-charges/articleshow/87767806.cms||---

Tripura Police had earlier said that action had been taken against various social media handles for falsely claiming that mosques have been burned down in the state when this was not the case. A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant issued notices to the Centre and the Tripura government on the joint petition filed by the three after hearing advocate Prashant Bhushan briefly. The bench said two others accused under UAPA have already been granted bail and ordered that "in the meantime, no coercive steps, including arrest, shall be taken against the petitioners". First petitioner Mukesh Kumar is an advocate registered with the Bar Council of Delhi and has been associated with the All-India Central Council of Trade Unions, Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) and People's Union for Civil Liberties. The second petitioner is Ansarul Haq Ansari, who said he is a human rights activist from Rajasthan, and the third petitioner is Shyam Meera Singh, a journalist with web portal Newclick who often highlights grievances of the marginalised and minority communities. The petitioners said their grievance is against "the targeted political violence against the Muslim minorities in Tripura during the second half of October 2021, and the subsequent efforts by the state to monopolise the flow of information and facts emanating from the affected areas by invoking provisions of the UAPA against members of civil society, including advocates and journalists who have made the effort to bring facts in relation to the targeted violence in the public domain". The UAPA was enacted in 1967 to counter the threat of left-wing extremism to India and its sovereignty. "If the state is allowed to criminalise the very act of fact-finding and reporting, and that too under the stringent provisions of the UAPA in which anticipatory bail is barred and the idea of bail is a remote possibility, the only facts that will come in the public domain are those that are convenient to the state due to the ‘chilling effect’ on the freedom of speech and expression of members of civil society. If the quest for truth and reporting thereof itself is criminalised then the victim in the process is the idea of justice," they said. The violence had erupted in the state after Durga Puja pandals were allegedly targeted in Bangladesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-relief-for-three-booked-under-uapa-by-tripura/articleshow/87767767.cms||---

Gurdwara Singh Sabha Committee of Gurugram, which has five gurdwaras affiliated to it — at Sadar Bazar sabzi mandi, Sector 39 (near Medanta), Sector 46, Jacobpura and Model Town — said it will approach the administration to seek permission to allow Muslims to offer namaz in small groups without compromising on Covid protocols. “It was disturbing to learn about the opposition to namaz in open areas. The doors of our gurdwaras are always open to everyone. If Muslims are facing problems in finding a place for Friday prayers, they are welcome to offer namaz in gurdwaras,” said Harry Sindhu from the committee. He said that while each gurdwara has the capacity to accommodate thousands of people at a time, they have been allowing only small groups due to Covid norms. Sher Dil Singh, another member of the committee, said a gurdwara is “guru ka darbar” where anyone can come and pray. “If our Muslim brothers are facing issues, we will offer them our premises at gurdwaras and their halls,” Singh said, adding that they will welcome whoever wants to offer prayers, irrespective of their faith and beliefs. Last Friday, the number of open sites where namaz is offered in the city came down from 37 to 20, which effectively reduced to 19 after protests at Sirhaul against use of public places for prayers. Welcoming the initiative of the gurdwara association, Khurshid Rajaka, chairman of Muslim Rashtriya Manch, said it will help establish peace and harmony. “Everyone should take inspiration from the Sikh community and help people from other faiths conduct their religious activities without any animosity,” Rajaka said, adding that there have been instances in the past too where Muslims have offered namaz at religious places of other communities. Altaf Ahmad, co-founder of Gurugram Muslim Council and Gurugram Nagrik Ekta Manch, said he and other Muslims in the city appreciated the “gracious offer” from Gurdwara Singh Sabha Committee. “This is a true example of brotherhood where people from multiple faiths have come forward to defeat divisive forces who have been spreading hatred and communal disharmony in the city over the past two 2 months,” said Ahmad. A day earlier, a Hindu man had offered a small commercial space to the Muslim community for namaz. “I am confident that more and more people across communities will come forward to offer their private properties where Muslims can pray every Friday for 30 minutes,” said Ahmad, adding that he hoped the Haryana government will take cognisance and allocate land to Muslims at the earliest for mosques so they can “pray with dignity”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gurgaon-gurdwara-association-offers-space-for-namaz/articleshow/87767979.cms||Bagish Jha
---||World||US says Iran government behind ransomware attacks||WASHINGTON: Iran's government is backing a hacker group responsible for recent ransomware attacks on targets in the United States and Australia, the US cybersecurity agency said Wednesday.  "The Iranian government-sponsored APT actors are actively targeting a broad range of victims across multiple US critical infrastructure sectors, including the Transportation Sector and the Healthcare and Public Health Sector," the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said in an alert.  It said that experts in the FBI, the Australian Cyber Security Centre, and Britain's National Cyber Security Centre had jointly reached the conclusion on Tehran's support for the "APT" group, or "advanced persistent threat," a designation often given to state-backed hackers.  Since at least March 2021, the group has exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet software to hack into systems, including those of a city government and a children's hospital, CISA said.  "These Iranian government-sponsored APT actors can leverage this access for follow-on operations, such as data exfiltration or encryption, ransomware, and extortion," it said.  CISA did not identify any specific targets for the group in the United States or Australia, or say how succesful they have been.  The US Department of Homeland Security estimates that ransomware attackers extorted at leat $350 million from victims last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-says-iran-government-behind-ransomware-attacks/articleshow/87768054.cms||---

Downpours in British Columbia this week trapped motorists in mudslides that left at least one dead and two missing, forced thousands to flee their homes, and cut off Vancouver and its port.  "In response to extreme flooding across Southern BC, we have approved the deployment of @CanadianForces air support personnel to assist with evacuation efforts, support supply chain routes, and protect residents against floods and landslides," Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said on Twitter.  A spokesperson told AFP the military was still sorting out the details of the deployment.  In Washington, ahead of a meeting with his US and Mexican counterparts, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the rains caused "historical and terrible flooding that has disrupted the lives and taken lives of people across B.C."  He pledged federal support, saying: "We'll be there for the cleanup and the rebuilding after the impacts of these extreme weather events." Airlifted to safety The torrential rains had let up by Tuesday afternoon. An estimated 300 motorists trapped on highways by mudslides have been airlifted to safety and a few of a dozen evacuation orders have been rescinded.  Meanwhile, searches continue for more possible victims, after police announced late Tuesday the recovery of a woman's body from a mudslide near Lillooet, 250 km (155 miles) north of Vancouver.  Television images showed several towns east of the Vancouver covered in mud and partially inundated, with residents now scrambling for food, heat and water -- as the first snow flurries of the season started to fall.  On the outskirts of Vancouver, a large fire broke out at an RV dealership in the flooded Sumas Prairie, and farmers scrambled to pull livestock from the water.  Abbotsford Mayor Henry Braun and emergency officials told a news conference almost 200 people had been airlifted overnight to safety, after the city of 162,000 warned a pump station was at risk of being overwhelmed due to the Nooksack River carrying a surge of water north from the United States.  Most of the area is farmland created by draining Sumas Lake in the 1920s.  The pump station, Braun said, "was never intended or designed to take on water from another country."  Some highways, meanwhile, remain closed. As a result, motorists wanting to travel to or from Vancouver have to travel south to the United States and back up into Canada.  Landslides also cut off rail traffic to and from Vancouver -- one of Canada's busiest freight sea ports.  Across the province, people are reportedly finding grocery store shelves empty.  Environment Canada said up to 250 millimetres (almost 10 inches) of rain -- what the region normally gets in a month -- fell Sunday and Monday in and around Vancouver, which was also hit last week by a rare tornado.  The extreme weather comes after British Columbia suffered record-high temperatures over the summer that killed more than 500 people, as well as wildfires that destroyed a town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/canada-sends-military-to-flood-ravaged-pacific-coast/articleshow/87768068.cms||---

Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance will hold a press conference on Thursday to announce the exoneration of Muhammad A Aziz and Khalil Islam, his office said Wednesday.  Aziz, 83, was sentenced to life in prison in 1966 but was released in 1985. Also sentenced to life, Islam was released in 1987 and died in 2009.  "These men did not get the justice that they deserved," Vance said in an interview with The New York Times. "What we can do is acknowledge the error, the severity of the error."  The newspaper said that a 22-month investigation conducted jointly by the Manhattan district attorney's office and lawyers for the two men found that prosecutors, the FBI and the New York Police Department withheld evidence that would likely have led to the acquittal of the two men.  A third man, Mujahid Abdul Halim, 80, confessed to Malcolm X's murder and was released from prison in 2010. Halim claimed during their 1966 trial that Aziz and Islam were innocent.  All three were members of the Black nationalist group Nation of Islam, which Malcolm X had recently renounced.  Malcolm X was shot dead by three gunmen on February 21, 1965 as he prepared to deliver a speech in a Manhattan ballroom.  Halim was taken into custody at the scene with a bullet wound to the leg.  Aziz and Islam were arrested several days later. Both denied involvement in the assassination and provided alibis for where they were at the time of the shooting. Innocence Project According to the Manhattan district attorney's office, Thursday's press conference will also be attended by civil rights attorney David Shanies and Barry Scheck, co-director of the Innocence Project.  Shanies and the Innocence Project, a nonprofit which has secured the exoneration of hundreds of wrongfully convicted prisoners in the United States, collaborated with Vance's office in re-investigating the case.  The review of the case followed the release of a Netflix docuseries "Who Killed Malcolm X?"  The Times said the re-investigation did not identify "who prosecutors now believe really killed Malcolm X, and those who were previously implicated but never arrested are dead."  "Nor did it uncover a police or government conspiracy to murder him," the newspaper said. "It also left unanswered questions about how and why the police and the federal government failed to prevent the assassination."  Considered one of the most influential African Americans of the 20th century along with Martin Luther King Jr, Malcolm X was an outspoken advocate of Black rights.  Born Malcolm Little in 1925, he fell into petty crime as a young man and became a devout follower of Islam while in prison.  Upon his release, he changed his surname to "X" as a symbol of the original name of his family lost under slavery.  He rose to prominence as a minister and spokesman for the Nation of Islam, advocating Black self-dependence and esteem. He also did not shy away from the use of violence for self-protection.  Disillusioned with the Nation of Islam, Malcolm X broke away from the group in 1964 and formed the short-lived Organization of Afro-American Unity to continue the promotion of Black rights.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/two-men-found-guilty-of-malcolm-x-murder-to-be-exonerated/articleshow/87768074.cms||---

In her petition, Moitra argued that the central ordinances were contrary to the SC’s own judgments on this issue. Moitra tweeted: “My petition just filed in Supreme Court challenging Union Ordinances on extension to CBI & ED Director tenures being contrary to SC own judgments.” TMC has already moved on Monday statutory resolutions in the Rajya Sabha objecting to the ordinances and said it will raise the issue in Lok Sabha. Sources said Moitra argued that the SC had held that ED director’s tenure cannot be extended beyond his retirement except in “rare and exceptional cases” and only for a “short period”. She said the “one year at a time” extensions cannot be construed as “short”, given the total tenure of ED and CBI directors were for two years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tmcs-mahua-moitra-moves-sc-says-ordinances-on-ed-cbi-chiefs-tenure-against-courts-rulings/articleshow/87768086.cms||Saibal Sen
---||Guwahati||'There has to be a dialogue on the core issue': Assam CM on Ulfa talks||ClarificationA news report published in the Delhi edition of TOI on November 18 under the headline, "Himanta 1st Assam CM ready to discuss Ulfa(I)'s core demand of 'sovereignty'", has been denied in a tweet from the chief minister's official handle.The source of the report was a video clip of CM Sarma speaking in Assamese to TV news channels. Responding to Ulfa(I) extending its unilateral ceasefire by another three months, Sarma said, "I welcome this step by Ulfa ... I would say this is a positive sign. I think somewhere down the line, there has to be a dialogue on the core issue (raised by the outfit). Sometime or the other, there has to be mutual understanding in terms of constitutional boundaries and Ulfa's demand. (These) efforts will continue, but I think this is a long process."As can be seen, the CM did say that at some stage, a dialogue is required on Ulfa’s core issue. The outfit has repeatedly demanded sovereignty. However, the CM did not specifically say that he was himself willing to discuss the issue of sovereignty. TOI’s headline may have conveyed a misleading impression, for which we apologise.Here is the updated news report.GUWAHATI: In a first by any Assam CM, Himanta Biswa Sarma on Wednesday said Ulfa-I's core demand would have to be discussed somewhere in the peace process. It is for the first time since the birth of Ulfa in 1979 that a chief minister of the state has dared to discuss Ulfa’s core demand with positivity. Sarma’s predecessors had either opted for a military option or had shied away from addressing this issue. However, former PM Manmohan Singh in 2005 had announced that the Centre was ready to discuss all “core issues” of Ulfa. The peace process, however, did not take off. Sarma said one needs a “fresh approach” (to the Ulfa issue) and “an equilibrium has to be created between the perimeters of the Constitution and the outfit’s demand” for sovereignty. “I think their core issue will have to be discussed at some point of time,” he added. While to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India is one of the Fundamental Duties enshrined in the Constitution, Ulfa (I) is ready to have the peace dialogue only if its core demand is discussed. Sarma said Ulfa was born over four decades back “for a specific reason” but the situation in the state has completely transformed over the years. “During this long period, the situation of Assam has changed so much…the problems that existed in 1984-85 have now changed their characters completely. Assam’s demography, economy and social aspects are completely different for then and now. I think we have to respect the emotions of the people and realign with the situation of present day and for that if we can change our mindset and thought process, we can move forward with a new outlook.” Sarma also welcomed Ulfa’s (I) extension of unilateral ceasefire by another three months and termed it as a positive gesture. He had earlier said Ulfa (I) chief Paresh Baruah has been saying in the media that discussions must be held on sovereignty but on the other hand whether it is the PM or the CM or any minister, he or she has taken the solemn oath to protect India’s sovereignty and “under this situation, both sides are on opposite poles.” He had then suggested finding a middle path.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/there-has-to-be-a-dialogue-on-the-core-issue-assam-cm-on-ulfa-talks/articleshow/87768135.cms||Prabin Kalita

His campaign said the money came from more than 20,000 donations in the first 24 hours but did not immediately provide further details, including the number of large contributions or how many came from Texas residents.  But although the numbers showed an early burst of enthusiasm for O'Rourke, the former El Paso congressman still has a long way to catch or even approach Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who this summer reported having at least $55 million in campaign funds. Abbott, who is seeking a third term, is the most prolific fundraiser of any governor in the US and routinely collects six-figure donations in big money from Texas executives.  O'Rourke raised $80 million in his 2018 Senate campaign - at the time a record for that office - but his donors will not be confined this time by federal campaign finance laws, since Texas has no limits on individual contributions.  O'Rourke launched his campaign Monday and is spending the first days of the race campaigning along the Texas-Mexico border, where Democrats are on the defensive after unexpected GOP gains there in 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/orourke-raises-2m-in-first-day-of-texas-governor-campaign/articleshow/87768148.cms||---
---||World||Cops search 4 Colorado locations in election security probe||GRAND JUNCTION: A law enforcement task force searched four western Colorado locations amid an investigation into allegations that an elections clerk was involved in a security breach of elections equipment earlier this year, a district attorney said.  The FBI, the Colorado Attorney General's office and local authorities conducted the searches, which were authorised by a federal court, on Tuesday in Mesa and neighboring Garfield counties, Mesa County district attorney Dan Rubinstein told Colorado Politics.  Rubinstein didn't disclose the locations that were searched, telling The Associated Press in an email that "all documents related to these operations are sealed" by court order.  But Tina Peters, the elections clerk for Mesa County, which includes the city of Grand Junction, said her home was searched, the Colorado Politics media outlet reported.  "The FBI raided my home at 6 a.m. this morning, accusing me of committing a crime," Peters said. "And they raided the homes of my friends, mostly older women. I was terrified."  The FBI office in Denver didn't immediately respond to an email requesting comment. Lawrence Pacheco, spokesman for Attorney General Phil Weiser, said the state is working with Mesa County on an investigation into the alleged election system breach but could not comment further on the continuing probe.  The searches came amid an ongoing dispute between Peters, who presided over elections in conservative Mesa County in 2020, and Griswold, a Democrat and vocal presence nationally for ensuring election integrity.  Peters has become an advocate for those who believe, without evidence, that the 2020 election was fraudulent - although she has said elections in Mesa County, which voted overwhelmingly for Trump, were secure and accurate. In contrast, Democrat Joe Biden handily defeated Trump in 2020, and Democrats control the governor's office, the state Legislature and all statewide offices.  Colorado Politics reported that Peters commented about the searches during an appearance on an online channel operated by Mike Lindell, the MyPillow CEO and a supporter of Peters and former President Donald Trump who has repeatedly made discredited claims that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.  Peters, a Republican, is being investigated by the FBI and by Colorado state officials state in an alleged breach of elections equipment in Mesa County in May. Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat, successfully sued to have Peters and a deputy, Belinda Knisley, prohibited by a judge from administering the November mid-term election. Peters has denied any wrongdoing.  Knisley was subsequently suspended and charged with felony second-degree burglary and a cybercrime misdemeanor count by Rubinstein's office. Knisley also has denied wrongdoing.  The Grand Junction Sentinel reported that an arrest warrant affidavit alleges Knisley entered a "building or structure with intent to commit a crime against another person or property."  Griswold sued to remove Peters as county clerk and recorder after Griswold said images of election equipment management software from Mesa County were obtained by elections conspiracy theorists and posted on far-right blogs.  Griswold's office has said one of the images was taken May 23 from inside a secure room in Mesa County where the voting equipment was stored and had been accessed that day by Peters, who allowed a non-employee into the room.  After Griswold filed the lawsuit, Peters was absent from Colorado for several weeks, only appearing publicly in broadcasts hosted by Lindell. Peters claimed that Griswold's investigation is an attempt to take over one of the few remaining conservative counties in Colorado.  Griswold's office has identified the person it says was allowed into the secure room but has refused to say anything more about who he is or why he was there. The Associated Press isn't naming him until more information becomes available. He has not been charged with a crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/cops-search-4-colorado-locations-in-election-security-probe/articleshow/87768203.cms||---

Skies were sunny Wednesday morning in the area around Sumas, Washington, where about 500 rescues and evacuations were reported.  "We're looking at going door-to-door, as waters go down in different parts of town," Sumas Mayor Kevin Christensen told The Seattle Times. "Half is on dry ground, half has water."  The soaking by a so-called atmospheric river that dumped torrents rain on the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia from Saturday through Monday reminded people of western Washington's record, severe flooding in November 1990 when two people died and there were more than 2,000 evacuations.  While the weather was improving, the situation remained dire in British Columbia, where the Canadian government was sending in the military to help out with floods and mudslides that destroyed parts of several major highways.  Immediately across the border from Sumas, residents of a low-lying area of Abbotsford, British Columbia, have been warned they face a significant risk to life and must evacuate to avoid rising water levels.  Mayor Henry Braun said Wednesday that conditions were bad overnight because a key pumping station was in danger of being overwhelmed. He said crews spent Tuesday night sandbagging around the station and things were "holding steady."  "I'm feeling much better today than last night," Braun said, although he cautioned the danger had not passed.  Fast-rising water levels on the Sumas River in Washington state on Tuesday overwhelmed rescuers in Abbotsford, where 1,100 homes were evacuated. Those residents joined thousands of others in the province who were forced from their homes by floods or landslides starting Sunday night.  Braun said Tuesday that impassable highways were creating havoc as authorities tried to get people to evacuation sites.  On Facebook, the City of Sumas said Wednesday that water levels were continuing to drop and it looked like the community wouldn't be affected by the situation in Abbotsford. It said crews were working hard to clear roads and return power to parts of town still without.  "These families and businesses need our prayers and support as we start the process of cleanup and rebuilding over the next few days," the city said in another Facebook post.  Across the border, the body of a woman was recovered from a landslide near the small community of Lillooet, British Columbia,. Royal Canadian Mounted Police said at least two other people were reported missing.  Southwest of Sumas, Washington, a 59-year-old man from Everson identified by police Tuesday as Jose Garcia remained missing after his truck was swept into a flooded field and he had been clinging to a tree.  In the city Ferndale, also southwest of Sumas, officials on Tuesday urged people in homes and businesses to evacuate in an area near the rising Nooksack River. Bystanders near the town's main street rescued a man Tuesday who mistakenly drove into floodwaters. The half-dozen people waded into waters up to their chests and pushed the floating car to drier ground.  The rains were caused by an atmospheric river - a huge plume of moisture extending over the Pacific and into Washington, Oregon and British Columbia.  About 5.57 inches (14.14 centimeters) of rain fell at Bellingham International Airport from Saturday through Monday, Nov. 15. The normal monthly rain total is 5.2 inches (13.2 centimeters) for November, according to National Weather Service data.  Washington Gov. Jay Inslee on Monday declared a severe weather state of emergency in 14 counties.  It was the second major widespread flood event in the northwest part of Washington state in less than two years, and climate change is fueling more powerful and frequent severe weather, Whatcom County officials told the Bellingham Herald.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-canada-border-towns-assess-damage-from-devastating-floods/articleshow/87768225.cms||---
---||World||Rittenhouse lawyers ask judge to declare mistrial over video||KENOSHA: Kyle Rittenhouse's attorneys asked the judge on Wednesday to declare a mistrial before the jury reaches a decision, saying the defence received an inferior copy of a key video from prosecutors.  Defense attorney Corey Chirafisi told Judge Bruce Schroeder that the defence would have approached things differently if it had received the higher quality video earlier.  He says the request would be made "without prejudice," meaning prosecutors could try Rittenhouse again if the judge were to grant the request.  Prosecutors countered that the jury saw the highest-quality version of the video during the trial and it was played without objection.  Schroeder did not immediately rule on the mistrial request.  THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.  KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) - The jury at Kyle Rittenhouse's murder trial will be allowed to review some of the video in the Kenosha shootings, after their request on the second day of deliberations Wednesday triggered debate between the judge and opposing attorneys over how to accommodate the request.  The judge, meanwhile, expressed irritation over the media's coverage and legal experts' commentary on some of his decisions, saying he would "think long and hard" about allowing televised trials in the future.  Jurors were weighing charges against Rittenhouse for a second day after they failed to reach a swift verdict Tuesday on whether he was the instigator of a night of bloodshed in Kenosha or a concerned citizen who came under attack while trying to protect property.  About two hours into deliberations Wednesday, jurors asked to view video shown earlier in the trial and Judge Bruce Schroeder said he would determine the procedures to allow that.  After getting the jury's request, the judge and the attorneys confronted a host of questions and, in some cases, sources of disagreement. Among them: Should the jurors watch the video in the courtroom or in the jury room? Who else can be present if it's done in the courtroom? And how many times should they be allowed to rewind and watch a piece of footage?  Prosecutor Thomas Binger said they should be able to view any video they wanted as many times as they wanted, and the judge seemed to agree.  "Sometimes there is one piece of evidence that is absolutely critical. ... To me, if they want to watch it 100 times, that's them," Schroeder said.  But defense attorneys said they would object to the jury viewing video taken by a drone that prosecutors said showed Rittenhouse pointing his gun at protesters before the shootings. The image prompted heated dispute earlier in the trial over technical questions about whether enlarging images notably changes them.  Both sides agreed with loading the videos that jurors wanted to see onto a computer for them to view in the jury room. The judge - who said he was "queasy" about allowing the drone video - said jurors hadn't asked to rewatch that video, only to have it ready to watch.  Earlier Wednesday, Schroeder took exception to news stories about his decisions to not allow the men Rittenhouse shot to be called victims and to allow Rittenhouse to play a minor role in determining which jurors were alternates, and the fact that he had not yet ruled on a defense motion for a mistrial.  Schroeder said he hasn't read the motion because he just received it on Tuesday.  "It's just a shame that irresponsible statements are being made," Schroeder said of comments in a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story from law school professors about him not ruling on the mistrial motion.  The case went to the anonymous jury after Schroeder allowed Rittenhouse to reach into a raffle drum and draw numbered slips that determined which of the 18 jurors who sat through the case would deliberate and which ones would be dismissed as alternates.  That task is usually performed by a court clerk, not the defendant. Schroeder has said he has been having defendants do it for at least 20 years.  "I would admit that there are not a large number of courts that do that, maybe not any," Schroeder said Wednesday.  The jury of 12 deliberated for a full day Tuesday without reaching a decision.  Rittenhouse, 18, faces life in prison if convicted on the most serious charge for using an AR-style semi-automatic rifle to kill two men and wound a third during a night of protests against racial injustice in Kenosha in the summer of 2020. The former police youth cadet is white, as were those he shot.  Rittenhouse testified that he acted in self-defense, while prosecutors argued that he provoked the violence. The case has become a flashpoint in the U.S. debate over guns, racial-justice protests, vigilantism, and law and order.  The jury appeared to be overwhelmingly white. Prospective jurors were not asked to identify their race during the selection process, and the court did not provide a racial breakdown.  Though protests have been generally muted around the courthouse during the trial, on Wednesday a man arrived carrying a long rifle and wearing what appeared to be body armor. After being approached by police, he left and returned a short time later without the gun. The man had spent Tuesday shouting anti-Black Lives Matter statements through a megaphone and was involved in a confrontation that day with another protester.  Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, who faced criticism over his response to the Kenosha protests in 2020, urged calm as the jury deliberated. He announced last week that 500 members of the National Guard would stand ready for duty in Kenosha if needed.  Rittenhouse was 17 when he went to Kenosha from his home in Antioch, Illinois, in what he said was an effort to protect property from rioters in the days after a Black man, Jacob Blake, was shot by a white Kenosha police officer.  In a fast-moving series of clashes in the streets, Rittenhouse shot and killed Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and wounded Gaige Grosskreutz, now 28.  During closing arguments Monday, prosecutor Thomas Binger said that Rittenhouse was a "wannabe soldier" who set the deadly chain of events in motion by bringing a rifle to a protest and pointing it at protesters just before he was chased.  But Rittenhouse lawyer Mark Richards countered that Rittenhouse was ambushed by a "crazy person" - Rosenbaum.  Rittenhouse testified that Rosenbaum chased him down and made a grab for his rifle, causing him to fear the weapon was going to be used against him. His account of Rosenbaum's behavior was largely corroborated by video and some of the prosecution's own witnesses.  As for Huber, he was gunned down after he was seen on video hitting Rittenhouse with a skateboard. And Grosskreutz admitted he had his own gun pointed at Rittenhouse when he was shot.  In his instructions to the jury, Schroeder said that to accept Rittenhouse's claim of self-defense, the jurors must find that he believed there was an unlawful threat to him and that the amount of force he used was reasonable and necessary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/rittenhouse-lawyers-ask-judge-to-declare-mistrial-over-video/articleshow/87768281.cms||---

Information and Broadcasting Minister Anurag Thakur said these uncovered villages of 44 aspirational districts across five states of Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Odisha will get 4G-based mobile services. "So, a total 7,287 uncovered villages will get telecom towers and services, and lakhs of people will get connectivity," Thakur said. The estimated cost of implementation of Rs 6,466 crore includes operational expenses for five years. The project would be funded by the USOF, and would be completed within 18 months of signing of the agreement, a statement said. The work related to provision of 4G mobile services in identified uncovered villages would be awarded through an open competitive bidding process as per extant USOF procedures. “The present proposal for provisioning of mobile services in the remote and difficult uncovered areas of aspirational districts across five states of Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Odisha will enhance digital connectivity useful for self-reliance, facilitate learning, dissemination of information and knowledge, skill upgradation and development, disaster management, e-Governance initiatives...,” the release said. The move would also enable establishment of enterprises and e-commerce facilities, provision of adequate support to educational institutes for knowledge sharing and availability of job opportunity, while fulfilling the vision of Digital India. USO Fund is meant to help provide telecom access in the remotest parts of the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mobile-links-in-7-3k-uncovered-villages-get-cabinet-nod/articleshow/87768367.cms||---
---||India||Coal ‘phase down’ taken from US-China COP26 statement, criticism of India unfair, say officials||NEW DELHI: Seeking to counter criticism from developed countries about India being the last-minute spoiler at the recent COP26 with regard to coal, senior officials pushed back saying such commentary is ill-informed and unfair. The term “phase down” which replaced “phase out” of coal emissions was taken from the US-China statement of the day before. Officials said India objected to the fact that only coal was mentioned and not oil and gas, which is primarily used by the developed countries. That puts countries like India and China in the dock while providing a loophole for western countries. Officials also said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remarks on net-zero and other climate pledges should not be confused with India’s NDCs — the PM was setting out “national goals” while the revised NDC is a technical document. The PM, sources said, made an “ambitious statement.” “It took many by surprise. PM said if you want higher ambition in mitigation, there should be more ambition in financing and adaptation. Ambition cannot be one-sided.” Brandon Wu, policy head of ActionAid US summarised the core "injustice" in a Twitter thread, where he described western actions as “climate colonialism.” “The text targets "unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies" which leaves GIANT loopholes for CCS (and "efficient" FF subsidies) as well as leaving out oil & gas entirely. India earlier suggested that it address ALL fossil fuels in an equitable manner. But an equitable fossil fuel phaseout would place most of the burden squarely on the US and rich countries… Instead, the #COP26 existing language has heavy implications for developing countries like India and tons of loopholes for the continuation of US fossil fuel activities.” India and China worked together on the coal language officials said, but unfortunately, India was in the spotlight as its environment minister was asked to read out the final outcome. Critics have pointed to India’s “naïveté” through which China was let off the hook while India took the brickbats, despite showing the biggest commitment to climate mitigation goals at the summit. “We objected to the over-emphasis on mitigation versus finance and adaptation”, sources said, adding India had consistently objected to the targeting of coal subsidies. There is, however, another view that if India had not asserted itself, the government would well have faced criticism for not being vigilant about the country's interests. The view in government is that the goals set out by the PM for 2030 are a strong goad for western nations to fulfill their side of the deal. The BASIC statement, officials said, made it clear India would not agree to phase out of coal subsidies — India was joined by South Africa, Australia, Indonesia, Venezuelan, Nigeria, China among others. A compromise was worked out bringing the language close to the G-20 statement, they added, “with national safeguards and adequate protection for poor and vulnerable countries.” Ultimately, “we tried to find consensus.” The final document brought back “phase-out” of coal subsidies on the request of small island countries, and kept “phase down” for coal. Sources said India has been consistently pushing for enhanced commitment in financing. “Neither finance nor technology transfers have been adequate by any means.” Officials also added that India was aiming to be a voice for other developing countries. “That’s our ethos,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/coal-phase-down-taken-from-us-china-cop26-statement-criticism-of-india-unfair-say-officials/articleshow/87768457.cms||Indrani Bagchi

Singh was speaking after inaugurating the three-day ‘Rashtraraksha Samarpan Parv Jalsa’ in the presence of UP CM Yogi Adityanath at Muktakashi Manch near the Jhansi fort. The event will witness multiple events related to India’s march towards attaining self-reliance in defence manufacturing. PM Modi is scheduled to attend the concluding day of the event on November 19. Praising Yogi, he said, “He is a combination of a ‘karmyogi’ and a ‘bhaktyogi”. “Gandhi’s ideology of swadeshi is similar to the Atmanirbhar Bharat concept, which BJP is committed to fulfil,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/atmanirbhar-bharat-must-aim-to-make-for-the-world-rajnath-singh/articleshow/87768503.cms||Arindam Ghosh

The exit of Narendra Bhati, CP Chand, Ravi Shankar Singh and Rama Niranjan came amid speculation about a coup by BJP to put SP on the back foot even before the battle begins. The term of all four MLCs in the upper house runs till March 7. “Akhilesh won’t be able to sleep tonight,” said UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh after inducting the four MLCs into the party at its state headquarters here. He urged all four to ensure their supporters joined BJP en masse at the booth and sector levels. Bhati had grabbed eyeballs for going against IAS officer Durga Sakhti Nagpal when the latter launched a crackdown on the sand mining mafia during SP’s last stint in government. He represents the politically influential Gurjar community in west UP. CP Chand is a Dalit from CM Yogi Adityanath’s backyard Gorakhpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-boost-to-bjp-before-up-polls-4-sp-mlcs-join-saffron-party/articleshow/87768581.cms||Pankaj Shah

"Bengaluru is the world's fastest-growing technology hub – of course, we want to be part of it. It is home to a third of India's unicorn companies. Australia's new mission in Bengaluru would expand our diplomatic presence in India to five posts," he said at the inaugural session of the Bengaluru Tech Summit. Australian foreign affairs minister Marise Payne said in a release that the new consulate-general will focus on "deepening Australia's ties to India's vibrant innovators, technologists and entrepreneurs". ‘This is about four like-minded democracies coming together’Australian foreign affairs minister Marise Payne said it will support Australian businesses in one of the world’s most important commercial centres. "Half of the next billion internet users are projected to be in India, and India’s digital economy, centred on Bengaluru, is set to grow to US$1 trillion by 2025,” Marise Payne said. Morrison referred to India and Australia’s friendship and said the countries are also working with the United States and Japan through the Quad Leaders Dialogue. ‘A positive partnership’"This is about four like-minded democracies coming together, from our region, to show we can make a positive difference in addressing our region's biggest challenges. It's a very practical and positive partnership – fostering an open, accessible, and secure technology ecosystem – that's a big focus of ours," he said. He announced the setting up in India of a new Australia-India Centre of Excellence for Critical and Emerging Technology Policy. He said it will bring together Australian and Indian technologists, policy practitioners, academics, researchers and thought leaders. He said it will help the two countries shape technology governance so it "aligns with our values and supports an open, inclusive and resilient Indo-Pacific region".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bluru-top-it-hub-well-set-up-consulate-oz-pm/articleshow/87768640.cms||---
---||World||US drug overdoses top 100,000 in pandemic year||WASHINGTON: US annual drug overdose deaths surged to more than 100,000 for the first time during the Covid-19 pandemic, a crisis driven mainly by fentanyl and exacerbated by a flood of fake online pills, officials said Wednesday.  Experts say people with substance use disorders have been hit hard by daily life disruptions, while authorities are seizing record numbers of counterfeit and sometimes deadly medicines from Mexico.  "As we continue to make strides to defeat the Covid-19 pandemic, we cannot overlook this epidemic of loss, which has touched families and communities across the country," President Joe Biden said in a statement.  Between April 2020 and April 2021, the country saw 100,306 fatal overdoses, an increase of 28.5 percent compared to the same period the previous year -- equal to one death every five minutes.  Overall, opioids accounted for 75,673 of the 100,306 fatalities, with the vast majority from synthetic opioids, primarily fentanyl.  "It's time to face the fact that this crisis seems to be getting worse. We need all hands on deck," health secretary Xavier Becerra said in a call with reporters.  "We see it in the faces of grieving families and all those overworked caregivers. You hear it every time you get that panic 911 phone call.  "You read it in obituaries of sons and daughters, who left us way too soon... and since Covid-19 hit, it's gotten worse."  Deaths from psychostimulants like methamphetamine, as well as from natural and semi-synthetic opioids, such as prescription pain medication, and cocaine were also up.  Covid-19 killed around 508,000 people in the same time frame, according to Our World in Data.  "Many of the challenges left behind by the pandemic will actually make people more vulnerable to mental illness and substance use disorders," Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse said in the briefing.  At the same time, the US Drug Enforcement Administration has warned Americans about prescription pills available online that are made to look like real Oxycontin, Vicodin, Xanax or Adderall, but contain lethal doses of fentanyl and methamphetamine.  The DEA has seized more than 14 million pills this year, with the vast majority produced in Mexico from chemicals supplied by China.  The fake pills are widely available on social media and e-commerce platforms.  In 2019, the latest year for which national data was available, heart disease was the leading cause of death, with some 660,000 fatalities, followed by cancer, with around 600,000 deaths, and unintentional injuries, at 175,000.  - Life-saving nasal spray - Biden's administration meanwhile announced the release of a "model law" it wants states to adopt that would widen access to naloxone, a life-saving nasal spray that reverses overdoses.  "I believe that no one should die of an overdose simply because they didn't have access to naloxone," said Rahul Gupta, director of national drug control policy.  "Sadly, today that is happening across the country."  The act includes provisions that would grant immunity to individuals who administer naloxone, require physicians to co-prescribe it when prescribing opioids, ensure health insurance covers the medicine, and seek to educate more people about the benefits.  Tom Wolf, the governor of Pennsylvania, said Wednesday his administration wanted ordinary citizens to carry the medicine, which is available to the public throughout the state's pharmacies.  In his statement, Biden touted a stimulus package that passed in March and delivered $4 billion to expand services for substance abuse and mental health.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-drug-overdoses-top-100000-in-pandemic-year/articleshow/87768662.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Students opting for tuitions double in Karnataka after Covid||BENGALURU: In yet another effect of pandemic on schoolgoing children, the number of students in Karnataka taking paid private tuitions have doubled from the pre-Covid times, said the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2021 released on Wednesday. According to the report, 10.7% of the children enrolled in schools were taking private tuitions in 2018. The figure dipped to 8.4% in 2020, possibly due to the lockdown. However, ASER 2021 shows that the number is at 20.5% now, a growth of around 10 percentage points. ASER 2021 was conducted in September-October 2021 when schools were starting to reopen and among 1.9 lakh households and 11,545 schools through phone calls. Nationally, the report noted that tuition classes were more common among children whose schools were still closed at the time of the survey. Across India, children taking tuitions in classes 1-5 has increased from 24% to 37%. In classes 3-5, it is 39% and classes 6-8, it is 39% and others is at 41%. Around 40% of government school children and 38% of private school children take tuitions.  In South India, the prevalence of tuitions was mostly in Kerala at 28%, which dropped to 19%. Tuition creates unnecessary competition, says expertTamil Nadu was 14% (now 17%), Maharashtra 14% (now 20%), Telangana 6% (now 10%) and Andhra Pradesh 15% (now 23%). Except in Kerala, tuitions have grown across all states, which the report said is a natural response to prolonged school closure. "It is curious that while economic disruptions may have moved children out of private schools, parents were still able to access tuitions where they had to pay fees. This may be due to the fact that tuition classes are a local phenomenon where payment may adjust flexibly and quickly based on demand and supply negotiated between the tutor and the family... The decisions to open or shut government schools are taken by authorities at district or state level with school teachers having no say in when or how school reopening can happen. But for the tuition sector, all decisions are local, flexible and can be immediate; these classes open or shut easily responding instantly to local conditions with different waves of the pandemic," said the report. Across the country, there is a 11-percentage-point growth in children taking tuitions. Among the southern states, Karnataka had the highest growth in this section and stood 11th overall. Educationists in the state echoed the reasons stated by the report. "Left with no choice, parents had to choose tuitions so that children do not lose out on studies. However, tuitions are not a healthy trend. It puts the focus only on exams and defeats the purpose of education as a goal. It creates unnecessary competition, while the important goals of schooling like socialisation are forgotten," said VP Niranjanaradhya, educationist. Trend across statesThe report indicates that in states like Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, tuition-taking was low in the past. In contrast, in the eastern states like West Bengal, Bihar and Odisha, going to tuition was common even in lower grades. In 2018, 50% of children of school-going age in Odisha, Bihar and West Bengal were taking tuitions. Now, it is 60% in Odisha and over 70% in Bihar and West Bengal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/students-opting-for-tuitions-double-in-ktaka-after-covid/articleshow/87768661.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Venkaiah Naidu says tech must focus on agriculture||Bengaluru: Vice President Venkaiah Naidu said the Bengaluru Tech Summit should focus on technology that can be implemented in agriculture, which continues to be the source of livelihood for millions of Indians.“The sector is facing turbulence,” he said, while speaking at the opening ceremony of the 3-day event. “There are challenges, and a lot of changes are happening because of climate change.” A 1-2 degrees celsius rise in temperature is likely to decrease rice production by about 0.75 tonnes per hectare in inland zones and 0.06 tonnes per hectare in coastal regions. Agriculture in the country is largely dependent on the four-month monsoon season, which has become erratic over the last few years. The increasing variability in precipitation has resulted in prolonged dry spells followed by heavy downpour resulting in flooding.Naidu said the Prime Minister is focused on transforming the entire system using technology. “Our country is going through the digital India programme. We have made remarkable progress in Aadhaar transformation, DBT (direct benefit transfer) and availability of various government services to the people. We must take advantage of tech advancement to accelerate digital transformation that will create real transformation. The PM’s mantra is reform, perform and transform,” he added.The theme for the 24th edition of the summit is `Driving the Next,’ highlighting the role of digital and technological innovations in driving growth of multiple sectors. Representatives from some 30 countries are participating, as are thousands of local tech leaders, technologists, and entrepreneurs, and more than 300 exhibitors.Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said he wants more accountability from the summit in terms of taking technology forward and having an impact on every human life.“Innovation is Saraswati (goddess of learning) and her vahana is hansa, that flies to the highest levels. Even in Kailash Manasarovara, you will have hansas and no eagles, and Benglauru is like hansa, a vehicle of Goddess Saraswati and we have to take it to the heights of Kailash Manasarovara. The best of talent is in Karnataka and I am sitting in a spaceship of the future,” he said.Biocon chief Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said the pandemic has brought the spotlight on technology with irreversible disruptions in the way people work. “Vaccines are being developed in less than a year, technology startups are booming, VC money is flowing in, and India is at the epicentre with its large talent pool of engineers and bioscientists,” she said.Ashwath Narayan, minister for IT & BT, and higher education, said the focus of technology has to be on impacting lives. “We all know about artificial intelligence – but how can farmers benefit from this through improved crop yield predictions? We know about the massive advancements in space and drone technology, but can it help in improved flood management and disaster relief?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/venkaiah-naidu-says-tech-must-focus-on-agriculture/articleshow/87768665.cms||---

The task group will work towards creating a projected roadmap for the growth of the industry, identifying the opportunities and challenges faced by the fintech ecosystem, and leveraging the partnering institutions and government to solve for them.B V Naidu, chairman, KDEM said, “India has emerged as one of the world’s fastest-growing tech innovation hubs in the world, with fintech leading the charge as the industry has raised close to $10 billion in investment. India’s financial inclusion and digitisation success story has been made possible by the combined efforts of the government as well as tech innovations, fundamentally disrupting the way masses access financial services. Taking a cue from this, KDEM launched the first Karnataka Fintech Task group, bringing together industry leaders to further pave the way for future innovations, founders, and citizens to participate in India’s fintech success story.”Reports by FICCI and BCG (Boston Consulting Group) suggest that the Indian fintech sector will attain a valuation of $150-$160 billion by 2025. Karnataka is home to India’s leading fintech companies like Razorpay, Zerodha, Khatabook, and Cred. These companies are tackling issues ranging from digital payments adoption to offering efficient neo-banking solutions, investment avenues, access to easy credit. Apart from Mathur, the task group comprises Timmanna Gouda of Whatsloan, Miten Sampat of Cred and Nithin Kamath of Zerodha, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-sets-up-task-group-for-fintech-growth/articleshow/87768666.cms||---

However, if she has two surviving children, she cannot avail this benefit. KSRTC managing director Shivayogi C Kalasad on Wednesday issued a notification allowing its employees who adopt children to avail maternity leave on par with biological parents. At present, adoptive parents had to take their own leave. The 180 days’ leave can be availed within the first year of adoption or before the child is one year old, whichever happens first. “We’re following the state government’s order to treat adoptive parents on par with biological parents,” said a KSRTC official. In February 2020, the state government had issued an order permitting women employees to take 180 days of maternity leave and 15 days of paternity leave for fathers. The KSRTC order, however, has no mention of paternity leave for adoptive fathers. Many KSRTC employees welcomed the move. “Being a transport employee is a stressful life. It’s a good move and benefits several women. Paternity leave should also be provided to male employees,” said a woman employee of KSRTC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ksrtc-women-who-adopt-to-get-180-days-maternity-leave/articleshow/87768668.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Canal froths, raises spectre of another Bellandur lake||BENGALURU: Huge chunks of foam were found floating on Wednesday morning in Belathur canal, off K R Puram, causing concern that the city may see a repeat of what happened in Bellandur lake, which began frothing owing to unbridled pollution a few years ago. Citizens residing near Belathur canal woke up to a shock when they noticed the chunks. Sudhakar Amirapu, a resident of Belathur, said in over 11 years he has never seen the canal foaming. “The residents of our apartment used to be happy to wake up to a clean canal, but the appearance of the foam on Wednesday was disturbing,” Sudhakar told TOI. Belathur canal, according to lake activists of Bengaluru and civic officials, is the remnant of Dakshina Pinakini river that once originated in Nandi Hills and flowed through Chikkaballapur, Bengaluru Rural, Bengaluru Urban and Kolar districts, before entering Tamil Nadu in Hosur. The canal carries water from Yelo Mallappa Shetty lake towards Kadugodi and Channasandra before entering TN. There are over 15 apartments with 500 flats on Belathur’s 3rd Main near where the canal flows. Residents alleged the stream is polluted due to release of industrial effluents into it. Tinu Cherian Abraham, a resident of Surakshaa Fariview Apartment, said it appeared that the infamous ‘snow from Bellandur’ was now descending on Belathur. “All these years, we never complained about the canal, but we are worried it may turn into another Bellandur or Varthur lake,” Cherian said. With the area near Belathur canal not getting Cauvery water supply and residents dependent on borewells, they are worried that the frothing could be a sign of high pollution that may affect the groundwater level. “As many of us depend on groundwater, our health is at stake with industrial effluents being released into the canal,” Cherian added. Priya M, another resident who recently shifted to Belathur, said she is concerned about her children and parents. “This industrial waste can be toxic. If another Bellandur happens, it might catch fire spreading toxicity in the air,” she said. In 2019, a proposal to revive Dakshina Pinakini hit a roadblock, with the government showing little or no interest in raising corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds to rejuvenate the river. ‘Govt doesn’t understand value of waterbodies’A veteran activist said several lake groups and environmentalists were keen on reviving lakes and kalyanis along Dakshina Pinakini. “If the government had made the decision to revive the lakes, there wouldn’t be froth in this canal today. The government does not understand the importance of waterbodies,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/canal-froths-raises-spectre-of-another-bellandur-lake/articleshow/87768670.cms||Nithya Mandyam
---||Bengaluru||‘Anywhere registration’ policy could see revival in Karnataka||BENGALURU: The government is looking at reintroducing the ‘anywhere property registration’ policy, after nearly a two-year hiatus, for the convenience of people. But with legal impediments to the policy (a related petition is pending before the high court), the government is being cautious in its approach towards bringing it back. First introduced in 2013, the policy has been propagated by successive governments as a move to ease property registration pangs of house owners. For instance, in Bengaluru Urban, there are five registrar districts — Shivajinagar, Basavanagudi, Gandhinagar, Jayanagar and Rajajinagar — with 42 sub-registrar offices under them. As per the present policy, any property registration in Bengaluru has to be done under the specific district registrar office. However, if the ‘anywhere registration’ policy is enforced, then a building/house owner can register his/her property anywhere in Bengaluru district. “We are in the process of reintroducing the policy, but need to look into the pros and cons of it. In the presence of an ‘anywhere registration’ facility, citizens needn’t go to the specific sub-registrar office under a specific district registrar jurisdiction for the purpose of registration,” said revenue principal secretary Tushar Giri Nath. Nath said the government is now seeking opinions from across the state and may even expand the policy to the bigger municipal jurisdictions in Karnataka. “While Bengaluru will be our focus, we are also collecting inputs on whether bigger municipal areas like Belagavi, Mysuru, Mangaluru and Hubballi-Dharwad can also be provided with the ‘anywhere registration’ policy,” said Nath, adding that the final decision will be taken by the revenue minister and tabled before the cabinet. There are 242 sub-registrar offices across the state under 34 district registrars. Inspector general of stamps and registration PN Ravindra told TOI t he has already sought the opinion of district registrars on whether the policy will assist the government or be detrimental to revenue collection. “But we cannot proceed without taking the judiciary into confidence. We are planning to prepare detailed reports on the matter, one from the IGR office and another from our legal team, to place before the HC for its approval of the policy,” said Ravindra. The court had in 2019 said that the decision was well-intended, but there were concerns shown by the petitioners that the policy could lead to multiple registrations of the same property and duplication issues. The court had asked the government to look into the matter and submit its response in three months. “Hopefully, by the end of this calendar year, the response will be ready for submission before the HC,” he said, adding that the delay was on account of Covid-19 pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/anywhere-registration-policy-could-see-revival/articleshow/87768672.cms||Sandeep Moudgal
---||Bengaluru||Researchers develop compound for autism treatment||Bengaluru: A group of researchers from Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR) in Bengaluru has developed a compound called 6BIO that can provide a better method to treat Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The team has already determined the potency of the compound in a preclinical mice model. It says this is the first compound that has been proved in preclinical evaluation to have the potential for improving efficiency of daily activities like learning and recollecting new tasks in patients with ASD/intellectual disability (ID).The research — carried out by Vijaya Verma, MJ Vijay Kumar, Kavita Sharma, Sridhar Rajaram, Ravi Muddashetty, Ravi Manjithaya, Thomas Behnisch and James P Clement from JNCASR — has been published in Experimental Brain Research.“Previous studies have attributed disruption in optimal brain development, mainly neuronal connections, during the early stage of development (babies/childhood) as one of the causes of ASD/ID. Due to altered brain development, information processing becomes aberrant and understanding simple tasks becomes exceptionally challenging for patients with ASD/ID,” the researchers said.Pointing out that current therapeutics to treat ASD aim to alleviate symptoms such as epileptic seizures or sleep issues but not to treat the multiple problems of ASD/ID, they said a major challenge in finding better therapeutics is the potency of the drug to help patients perform daily activities with efficiency close to that of a healthy person. Achieving this is particularly difficult after a certain age, especially from the mid-childhood stages, they said, adding that ASD patients still struggle to perform everyday activities without assistance from others as they are unable to learn and recollect new tasks. “Data from the current study indicates that 6BIO — synthesised in JNCASR — can help such children learn and recall, be social, and alleviate other symptoms such as seizures or sleep issues. Thus, 6BIO, can be a better therapeutics option to treat ASD,” they said. Using electrophysiology, which helps understand how neurons communicate, and behaviour experiments, which indicate the overall brain function, the team has shown that 6BIO can restore the information processing in the preclinical mouse model. Therefore, the compound, they said, had a strong potential for therapeutics to treat ASD/ID. ‘Restored neural functions after mid-childhood too’All the behaviour and electrophysiology work was performed in Dr James Clement’s lab at JNCASR, the authors said, adding that another novelty of this study was that 6BIO restored the neural functions not only when administered during development (1-2 years) and childhood stages (3-6 years) but also after mid-childhood (7-11 years) when most of the brain regions are considered to have formed properly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/researchers-develop-compound-for-autism-treatment/articleshow/87768674.cms||---

However, they say due to poor frequency and unpunctuality of trains, benefits of the facility aren’t being completely realised.South Western Railway (SWR) operated 10 trains a day to and from the halt station when it was inaugurated on January 4, 2021. However, services were suspended from April-end to November first week. At present, only two-pairs of trains (06387/06388 Bengaluru-Kolar-Bengaluru and 06383/06384 Channapatna-Kolar-Channapatna) are operational. A TOI team on Wednesday boarded 06387 KSR Bengaluru-Kolar from Byappanahalli railway station for a reality check of airport services. However, the train which was scheduled to reach Byappanahalli at 8.59am arrived only at 9.47am, a delay of 48 minutes. In fact, when asked for a ticket to the halt station, a railway official said he will not be responsible if there is any delay. The train reached KIA halt at 10.34am (47 minutes); the ticket fare from Byappanahalli is Rs 10. Bangalore International Airport Limited, which operates KIA, has arranged free shuttle bus services from KIA halt to the airport terminal. The TOI team reached the terminal at 10.46am. However, there were only two-three passengers in the bus. One of them remarked: “This is an awesome facility. It’s cheaper and faster and also provides a view of greenery along the tracks. It’s a different feeling as there are no traffic jams. But they (authorities) should operate at least one train every 30 minutes. People may miss their flights if SWR doesn’t provide reliable service. As of now, it’s suitable only for airport staff.” KN Krishna Prasad, railway activist and member of Karnataka Railway Vedike, said: “SWR could operate one train each per hour via Yeshwantpur and Channasandra so there will be a train via KSR Bengaluru City station every 30 minutes.”He said Yelahanka-Devanahalli is a single track. “SWR could double the section between the two locations and also upgrade Bettahalasur and Chikkajala/Doddajala to crossing stations. This will help it run more trains to and from KIA halt station,” Prasad added.It usually takes more than one hour by road to reach the airport from Byappanahalli. BMTC Vayu Vajra fare is Rs 230, and the trip costs around nearly Rs 1,000 if one uses an app-based cab. The halt station was built by BIAL at a cost of around Rs 3 crore and aimed at benefiting 28,000 airport employees as well as passengers. SWR officials said only 2,098 passengers travelled between January and April and it earned a ticketing revenue of Rs 20,830. AN Krishna Reddy, senior divisional commercial manager, Bengaluru division, was unavailable for comments.Full report toi.in||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/passengers-want-1suburban-train-tokia-every-30-mins/articleshow/87768675.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||... while women eye final berth||Bengaluru: It won’t be out of place to say that this is a coming-of-age season for the Karnataka women’s cricket team. The Veda Krishnamurthy-led side has been dominant in the BCCI women’s One-Day Trophy. They have been ticking the boxes with firebrand performance from the top-order batters, disciplined bowling and marked improvement in fielding.Karnataka will start favourites against Punjab when the two sides meet in the semifinals at the Alur cricket ground on Thursday. On a six-match winning streak, the Mamatha Maben-coached side will look to go the distance in the competition, having exited in the quarterfinals in the previous season. Attributing the success to teamwork, former India skipper Mamatha pointed out, “The team is a mix of youth and experience and everyone has been contributing. Veda has played a huge role in moulding this team. The team has been good over the past couple of seasons, but Veda has taken them up by a few notches with her leadership skills and ability to read the opposition well. Also, the support we have got from the KSCA, especially in these testing circumstances, has been unconditional.”On the performance of the top-order comprising S Shubha, D Vrinda and G Divya, Mamatha said, “They have been brilliant. In my five-year stint as Karnataka coach, this season has been the most satisfying because they have played to their potential.”Mamatha also praised the bowlers and the bench strength, which has been tested in every match as the starting XI has been different in all six matches. On playing Punjab, Mamatha stated, “We see it as another match. Although the goal is to finish on top, we are taking one match at a time. The team which performs better on the day will have the upper hand. So, we will focus on our strengths and play to our potential.”Both the teams will have an eye on the weather with rain predicted for Thursday as well. In the event of a washout, Karnataka will enter the final on the strength of the outright wins.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/-while-women-eye-final-berth/articleshow/87768677.cms||---

This discovery work has been published in the refereed journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, titled “Discovery of an inflated hot Jupiter around a slightly evolved star TOI-1789”.“This discovery was made using PRL Advanced Radial-velocity Abu-sky Search (PARAS) optical fiber-fed spectrograph, the first of its kind in India, on the 1.2 metre Telescope of PRL at its Mt. Abu Observatory. Using PARAS, which has the capability to measure mass of an exoplanet, the exoplanet’s mass is found to be 70% and size about 1.4 times that of Jupiter,” Isro said.While these measurements were carried out between December 2020 and March 2021, further follow-up measurements were obtained from TCES spectrograph from Germany in April 2021, and also independent photometric observations from the PRL’s 43-cm telescope at Mt. Abu. “The star is known as HD 82139 as per the Henry Draper catalogue and TOI 1789 as per the TESS catalogue. Hence, the planet is known as TOI 1789b or HD 82139b as per the IAU (International Astronomical Union) nomenclature,” the researchers said.This newly discovered star-planet system is very unique — the planet orbits the host star in just 3.2 days, thus placing it very-very close to the star at a distance of 0.05 AU (roughly one tenth the distance between Sun and Mercury).“There are less than 10 such close-in systems known among the zoo of exoplanets known so far. Because of the close proximity of the planet to its host star, it is extremely heated with a surface temperature reaching up to 2000 K, and hence an inflated radius, making it one of the lowest density planets known (density of 0.31 gram per cc),” an Isro statement read.Such close-in exoplanets around stars (with distance less than 0.1 AU) with masses between 0.25 to a few Jupiter masses are called “Hot-Jupiters”, the researchers said. “The detection of such a system enhances our understanding of various mechanisms responsible for inflation in hot-Jupiters and the formation and evolution of planetary systems around evolving and aging stars,” they added.This is the second exoplanet discovered by PRL scientists using PARAS at 1.2 m Mt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/inflated-hot-jupiter-around-a-sub-giant-star-discovered/articleshow/87768678.cms||---

Police said the gang recorded his dance and shared the video on two WhatsApp groups, where the main accused and the victim are members. KR Puram police have taken up a criminal case based on a complaint filed by Sujatha, wife of victim Sathish, against the gang. However, the main suspect, Dayal Manju aka Puli Manju, left for the US a day after a case was registered against him. D Devaraj, deputy commissioner of police (Whitefield), said the case was registered on Monday and police learnt that the main suspect went to the US via Delhi on Tuesday. Investigation is on to trace and nab the other suspects. According to preliminary probe, Manju and Sathish belong to the same community. A few months ago, Manju, a soothsayer, had given Sathish Rs 2 lakh. Later, Manju complained to his community leaders, saying Sathish hadn’t returned the money. On Saturday, Manju allegedly abducted Sathish in a car and took him near Mulbagal in Kolar district. The gang forced him to remove his clothes and made him perform snake dance. They recorded it and shared it on two WhatsApp groups of their community. The gang freed him later. The incident came to light on Monday, when Sathish’s sister saw the video on the WhatsApp group and informed his wife Sujatha. Sujatha rushed to KR Puram police station and filed a complaint against Manju and other unknown persons. Police registered a case under IPC sections 364a (kidnapping for ransom), 368 (wrongfully concealing or keeping in confinement, kidnapped or abducted person), 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) and section 66E of IT Act (punishment for violation of privacy) against the gang. Further probe is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/miscreants-make-abducted-cabbie-strip-do-snake-dance/articleshow/87768683.cms||Santosh kumar.B
---||Bengaluru||Youth vanishes with Rs 3.5 lakh bike in Bengaluru, returns after police complaint||BENGALURU: A 20-year-old youth who had taken a Royal Enfield bike for a test ride from a showroom in Rajajinagar on Monday afternoon remained incommunicado for a few hours, prompting the staff to lodge a police complaint. While cops began efforts to get in touch with the youth, the bike was parked in front of the showroom later in the night. The showroom is located on Dr Rajkumar Road in Rajajinagar D Block. Around 1.30pm, the youth, identifying himself as Varun, dropped in and wished to take a test ride on a Royal Enfield Continental GT 650 bike. The showroom had a four-year-old bike for test rides. Varun handed over a photocopy of his driving licence and provided two of his mobile numbers. Showroom staff gave him the keys at 2pm and Varun, who was alone, rode away. When Varun failed to return, the staff grew anxious. “Usually, test rides last one or two hours at the most. We waited till 6.45pm in vain. We tried to reach him on his mobile numbers but they were switched off. Finally, the same night, we lodged a complaint with Rajajinagar police,” a showroom staffer told TOI. The FIR put the value of the bike at Rs 3.5 lakh. Cops booked Varun under IPC sections 379 (vehicle theft) and 420 (cheating). An investigating officer tried to contact him on his mobile, which was not reachable at that point of time. By 9pm, the bike was seen parked outside the showroom. The rider left the keys in the pouch of the bike and vanished before security personnel could question him, police said. “We will summon Varun, seek an explanation for the delay and parking it outside the showroom without communicating with the staff. As police station staff tried calling him on his mobile, he must have got to know of the complaint. Things will become clear only after we question him,” police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/youth-vanishes-with-3-5l-bike-returns-after-police-plaint/articleshow/87768685.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||BFC coach hopes for better show||Bengaluru: Looking to resurrect the team's fortunes, after the former champions settled for a disappointing seventh place last season, coach Marco Pezzaiuoli expects Bengaluru FC to put in a much-improved performance in the new season of Indian Super League beginning in Goa on Friday.The coach, who took over from Spaniard Carles Cuadrat, was not ready to read too much into the lack of experience in the absence of mainstays including Juanan, Dimas Delgado and Eric Paartalu and said his side has a good mix of experience and young talent. "The important part is the quality and mindset of the players. I'm not afraid that they (new players) don't know about the league. It's a new step as we lost Dimas, Eric and Juanan – crucial players of the BFC team. But we want to become younger," he said. "We have prepared well for the last two months. I think we want to be better than the last season. We will see a Bengaluru FC team that will try to reach the playoffs and we are working very hard for this."RELIANCE ON TRIOAsked about the Blues continued reliance on the trio of skipper Sunil Chhetri, Cleiton Silva and Udanta Singh for goals, the coach said: "It doesn't matter who scores and it's not like before when the striker doesn't defend. It's also about not conceding many goals (last season BFC scored 26 and conceded 28). In the end, I don't care who score the goals – defender, medio or striker. We also have many offensive midfield players."BATS FOR MORE GAMESThe highly rated Pezzaiuoli, who had stints in South Korea, Japan and China, also wanted more matches for the youngsters. "Twenty games in a season are not enough. You have five-six months of holiday only for preparation and you cannot develop a player. There needs to be a change if India wants to take the next step. “We need to change the league system and the youth system to give more matches to the youth players. (Maybe) we should start in the beginning of October to the beginning of May. You need to get up to 50 games a year to develop," said the coach.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bfc-coach-hopes-for-better-show/articleshow/87768721.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Rowdy attacks cop in Ashoknagar, shot at||BENGALURU: Police shot at and injured a murder suspect and rowdy — Palani alias Kerchief Palani —after he allegedly attacked them in Ashoknagar cemetery late Tuesday night. Facing more than 22 criminal cases, including three murders, Palani was recently booked in the murder case of Munnakumar, 35, reported in Bellandur on November 10. Munnakumar, a resident of Kasavanahalli slum quarters, was walking towards a shop at 8pm when a gang of four miscreants led by Palani stabbed him to death. Police claimed Munnakumar was innocent and had no criminal antecedents. Palani objected to Munnakumar walking freely at night and that led to an altercation, police said. Palani, who once sold kerchiefs for a livelihood, had attacked police twice earlier. Sleuths from the Organised Crime Wing-2 traced him near the cemetery at 11pm. A team headed by HS Parmeshwar rushed to the spot. “Palani resisted arrest, assaulted inspector Harish Kumar with a dagger and injured him on his left elbow. The ACP fired at his left leg. He has been admitted to Bowring hospital,” Sandeep Patil, joint commissioner of police (crime), said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/rowdy-attacks-cop-shot-at/articleshow/87768722.cms||---

The state government on Wednesday appointed him as the additional chief secretary of the department. Pathak, a 1990 batch Bihar cadre officer, was waiting for posting after returning from central deputation. Additional chief secretary (home) Chaitanya Prasad has been relieved of the additional charge of the department. It is the second time that Pathak has been given this department since CM Nitish Kumar enforced prohibition law in the state on April 5, 2016. Known for his strictness and honesty, Pathak has been entrusted with the responsibility of handling the department just a day after Nitish held a marathon meeting with his ministers and officers to review the loopholes in the implementation of prohibition law following a series of hooch incidents in the state claiming more than 50 lives in the last two months. The meeting concluded with Nitish’s message that prohibition must be enforced with an iron hand. Before he went on central deputation, Pathak was given the responsibility of mines and geology department when the government was facing illegal mining problems in the state and corruption issues in the department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/kk-pathak-back-in-prohibition-dept/articleshow/87766607.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Ahmedabad||Bopal, Vatva sinking along with groundwater levels in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: Amdavadis are pumping so much water from the ground that parts of the city are sinking. A recent study by the Institute of Seismological Research has found a strong correlation between land subsidence (sinking) and depletion of groundwater. Areas surrounding Bopal-Ghuma in the west and the industrial area of Vatva in the east are sinking 25 mm per year. “The water wells of Bopal, Arbudanagar, Hazipur garden and Ghuma indicate subsidence of about 2.0 mm/yr. Large ground subsidence of 9.8 mm/year is also estimated at Sola well, followed by a subsidence rate of 8.2 mm/year at Shilaj,” stated the study published in the Geocarto International journal, a reputed scientific journal published by Taylor & Francis. Experts say land subsidence is a cause of concern as it leads to micro-level topographic changes, cracks and fissures in the surface and ultimately causes heavy damage to city infrastructure like newly laid underground civic lines and even concrete structures on the surface. “The south-eastern part of the city and parts of neighbouring rural areas experienced high levels of subsidence. The west-central and east-central parts of the city reveal moderate and low subsidence, respectively,” claimed the study by ISR researchers Rakesh Dumka, Sandip Prajapati and D Suribabu. “Spontaneous water removal leads to vertical compression of aquifer sediments by reducing pore pressure and soil compaction resulting in land subsidence. Land sinking promotes micro-level topographic changes, cracks and fissures in the surface, ultimately causing heavy damage to city infrastructure,” says Dumka. “The Vatva well indicates a subsidence rate of 8.1 mm/year. Significant sinking of up to level of 3.0 mm/year is also estimated in the central part of the city,” states the study. The scientists had relied on groundwater level data from the central groundwater board between 1996 and 2020. They painstakingly used Sentinel satellite’s Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar data between 2017 and 2020, which measures ground deformation with an accuracy of sub-centimetre level, and the latest Global Navigation Satellite System-based precise technique to measure land subsidence. The scientists have appealed for greater public participation to arrest this phenomenon, including implementation of groundwater recharge in town planning schemes and its insistence in municipal governance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bopal-vatva-sinking-along-with-groundwater-levels-in-abad/articleshow/87766940.cms||Paul John

---||Patna||Passengers raise ruckus at Patna airport over 7-hour delay in SpiceJet flight||PATNA: SpiceJet passengers created a ruckus at the Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport on Wednesday after their flight to Mumbai was delayed by seven hours. They alleged that the timing was changed without informing them beforehand. Bhupesh C H Negi, the director of the city airport, told mediapersons that SpiceJet’s Patna-Mumbai flight (SG-392) was rescheduled due to some technical problems. “All the passengers are being taken care of by the airline,” he added. According to sources, SG-392 was supposed to leave Patna at 11.30am and reach Mumbai at 2.15pm on Wednesday. It eventually took off at 9.50pm without any passenger. Asked about the “technical problem”, an official of the Central Industrial Security Force deployed at the city airport replied, “SpiceJet’s Ahmedabad-Patna flight (SG-391) landed at the airport on its scheduled time at 11am, but the airline detected some technical fault in the aircraft after which it did not fly to Mumbai.” On the other hand, Ritik Kumar, a passenger travelling by the Ahmedabad-Patna flight (SG-391), alleged that the oxygen level in the cabin air fell suddenly due to which many flyers fell unconscious. He tweeted, “Please take some action regarding today’s incident happened in Ahmedabad to Patna SpiceJet flight (SG-391). During flight oxygen level gone down for 15-20 minutes and oxygen bag was also empty of majority passengers. Due to which many passengers got unconscious (sic).” TOI, however, could not get in touch with any passenger of the Ahmedabad-Patna flight to verify the incident. Meanwhile, the passengers waiting for their flight at the Patna airport condemned the alleged apathetic attitude of SpiceJet towards them. Nandan Shandaliya, one of the passengers, tweeted, “Pathetic service at Patna airport as flight SG-392 was rescheduled at boarding time and no intimation was given beforehand. The airlines has no commitment towards its passengers. Not a single responsible person is available (sic).” Another flyer, Kshitiz Anand, rued, “This happens regularly at the Patna airport. Kids are crying and critical patients are desperate to reach Mumbai, but the airline does not care.” Niraj Kumar, who was also waiting to fly to Mumbai, said, “Since our flight was delayed, we were told we would get breakfast and lunch. We have, however, not received anything yet. The security hold area is crowded and there is no space to sit.” A SpiceJet employee, however, claimed, “Our ground staff assisted all the passengers.” As many as 160 flyers finally left for Mumbai by a special aircraft after 6pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/passengers-raise-ruckus-at-airport-over-7-hour-delay-in-spicejet-flight/articleshow/87765931.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Divyangi gives wolf-breeding a leg-up||AHMEDABAD: Divyangi, a disabled female wolf, has enabled Gujarat to launch one of India’s most ambitious wildlife breeding programmes, which involved a royal exchange — the state traded three lions to find partners for Divyangi and her sisters. The state, at that stage in 2016, had no male wolf. Now, Divyangi has birthed an initiative under which 30-zoo bred Indian wolves will be released into the wild in Banaskantha in December. A senior officer of the Gujarat forest department in Gandhinagar said that the programme began with Divyangi. She was brought to the Sakkarbaug zoo in 2010 with a severe impairment in one of her forelegs. Her treatment and rehabilitation protocol continued till 2016. Just five years later, she is being hailed as the heroine of the success story with a happy beginning: an extended family of 39 wolves. “Though Sakkarbaug is the leading zoo for Indian wolves, it had only three females and Divyangi had a disability,” the officer said. “The department, however, did not lose heart and gave an Asiatic lion each to Mysore, Jodhpur, and Jaipur zoos in 2016 and received one male wolf from each of them.” Divyangi found the Mysore male to be the lupine equivalent of Mr Right. In 2017, she gave birth to one pup. The next year, she delivered four more pups and the breeding programme was howling with triumph. Divyangi passed away in 2018, but her legacy will stride with packs spanning generations in Gujarat. The Gujarat forest department has received the approval from the Central Zoo Authority of India to liberate the 30 wolves into the wild in Banaskantha. The government issued a circular last week permitting the release of these wolves to control the nilgai population in the region. The circular notes that Sakkarbaug was made the key breeding centre for wolf conservation. Forest department officials said that the government has formed an eight-member committee headed by the principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) to oversee the release. A veterinarian from Junagadh and the Sakkarbaug zoo director are among the committee’s members The officer said that the committee has been asked to prepare an enclosure with a prey base within two weeks and then begin a soft release of the wolves. The officials said that the team has been asked to talk to the farmers in the area to avert human-wolf conflicts. The farmers will be made aware that the wolves will help control nilgai and wild boar populations that damage crops. The officials said that they had been awaiting the nod to release the wolves since April 2020. The officials said that Divyangi will be made the mascot of the programme. The first pup of Divyangi, Deepak, is now the male spearheading the breeding drive. Another senior officer associated with the programme said that in the past wolves were found in the thousands in Gujarat. But according to a recent estimate, there are now fewer than 400 in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/disabled-divyangi-gives-wolf-breeding-a-leg-up/articleshow/87766977.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

However, the Karnataka bench of the GST Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) may have put an end to the debate on whether or not eggs are an agricultural produce. The AAR was approached by SAS Cargo, which transports consignments across India using leased railway containers. It sought clarity on applicability of goods and services tax (GST) on transportation of eggs. The AAR said, in view of the notification No. 12/2017 dated June 28, 2017, eggs are indeed an agricultural produce. Thus, transportation of eggs will not attract GST. According to this notification, agricultural produce means any produce out of cultivation of plants and rearing of all life forms (except rearing of horses), for food, fibre, fuel, raw material or other similar products. The notification also requires that no further processing should be done on such items. Or, processing done by the cultivator or producer should be such that it does not alter the essential characteristics of the produce but makes it more marketable for the primary market. The GST commissioner whose comments were sought by the AAR was of the view that the intention of the notification appears to be to give relief to farmers who, in addition to cultivation, may undertake certain agro-based activities like animal husbandry, sericulture, etc. Whereas operating a hatchery and production of eggs is a commercial activity. However, the AAR held that ‘fresh eggs in shell’, on which no further processing is done, are covered under the definition of agricultural produce. Thus, transportation of eggs by rail from one place in India to another would be exempt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/aar-eggs-an-agri-produce-transport-not-to-incur-gst/articleshow/87767656.cms||Lubna Kably
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Success of Covid-19 vaccination drive hides inequality across districts||VISAKHAPATNAM: The first dose Covid-19 vaccine coverage has exceeded 85% in Andhra Pradesh. About 57% of the total eligible beneficiaries have been fully immunised with two doses. Andhra Pradesh is one of the few states in the country to achieve more than 85% first dose coverage. But there is a variation among districts in terms of the extent of the public that has received the inoculations. Vizianagaram and Srikakulam are lagging behind with about 76% first dose coverage, while some districts like Prakasam and Nellore have already achieved more than 90% coverage. Apart from vaccine hesitancy or complacency, the state health officials attribute the trend to migrations from these backward north coastal Andhra Pradesh districts. Srikakulam and Vizianagaram are the only two districts that are yet to cross the 80% coverage milestone in the state. Corresponding with their first dose numbers, Prakasam, Nellore and Kadapa have already administered the second dose to more than 60% of the eligible population in their respective districts. The number of eligible beneficiaries for Covid-19 vaccine in Andhra Pradesh has been revised to 3.95 crore. The health department had earlier estimated it at 3.47 crore people. As per the Union government’s communique, East Godavari, the most populous district of the state, has about 42 lakh beneficiaries. Officials have to give jabs to nearly 19 lakh people in Vizianagaram, the lowest number for any district in the state. The Union government sent 1.15 crore doses to Andhra Pradesh as its October allocation, the highest-ever doses given to the state in any single month, after it allocated 1.05 crore doses in September. The state will get 86.8 lakh doses in November, including 68.9 lakh Covishield doses and 17.9 lakh Covaxin doses. The state has so far received 5.4 crore vaccine doses from the Union government, while it has procured 21 lakh doses on its own. The first dose vaccine coverage among the 18-44 age group has touched the 72% mark. The health department has identified nearly two crore eligible beneficiaries in the 18-44 age bracket.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/success-of-vax-drive-hides-inequality-across-districts/articleshow/87766387.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Kolkata||Calcutta high court rap for SSC ‘foul play’||KOLKATA: Calcutta High Court took exception to the alleged foul play over appointment of 25 people by the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education based on “recommendations” of the West Bengal Central School Service Commission. The court will hear the case again on Thursday. Justice Abhijit Gangopadhyay declined to give more time to the School Service Commission (SSC) for inquiry after it unfolded that “no such recommendation letters” were issued by the four regions of SSC though copies of the letters were produced in court earlier. “It appears that some foul play has been committed in giving appointment on the basis of some recommendation letters which were not issued by the appropriate authority,” the court observed. Earlier in the day, the West Bengal Central School Service Commission secretary came under fire for being unable to come up with a response to the alleged foul play. The “foul play” came to light on Wednesday when SSC counsel Kishore Dutta submitted that the SSC Northern Region intimated the commission that it had not issued the recommendations. Dutta sought more time for investigation, pleading that the Commission had no intention to protect anyone. Justice Gangopadhyay declined the SSC prayer on grounds that the entire database in SSC computers “could be changed by a click of a button”. The court observed that it could order a CBI probe, if necessary. The judge asked the SSC counsel to come up with the response of the other three regions by 3pm. State counsel Samrat Sen submitted that “the matter really requires some enquiry” and proposed an investigation under a retired HC judge. The court before considering the SSC proposal directed the SSC to file an affidavit by 2pm on Thursday stating clearly that no SSC region, including the South-Eastern Region that was named earlier, issued any recommendation letters. The court also ordered the 25 people whose appointment letters were filed on Thursday as supplementary affidavits should be made parties to the case. The court also directed the district inspector of schools to stop their salary forthwith. Counsel for petitioners Bikash Bhattacharya drew the court’s attention to 500 such appointment letters that were issued in the meantime. “Appropriate order in this respect will be passed at any subsequent stage,” the court held.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/high-court-rap-for-ssc-foul-play/articleshow/87767449.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Women used as cover for cannabis transport||VISAKHAPATNAM: Posing as tourists, some drug peddlers, including women from parts of Andhra Pradesh, southern Odisha, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Telangana visit the tribal pockets in Vizag Agency and Andhra Odisha Border (AOB) areas and smuggle cannabis in cars to various destinations. The lure of easy money draws these women into the illegal business. Gangs deploy women to pose as tourists and facilitate the trade. With demand for cannabis increasing among students and youngsters in metros and cities, the gangs have been adopting innovative and sophisticated ways to transport the green drug from Vizag Agency and AOB. The interstate ganja smugglers use women from financially backward sections to transport the contraband in cars. “We have observed that some people in the guise of tourists visit tourist locations in Vizag Agency and procure the weed. They then transport it (between two to five kilos) in cars. During routine vehicle checks, some people posing as tourists were caught with weed. However, it is not possible to suspect every tourist to be a drug peddler and check their baggage,” said Narsipatnam ASP, V Manikanta. “We would intercept vehicles and examine the luggage only if we get credible information about the transportation of weed,” he added. Of the 1,188 prisoners in Vizag Central Prison who have been booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 28 male prisoners are serving sentences between one to 10 years. Of the 1,160 remand prisoners, 75 are females while some prisoners held for ganja smuggling are from other states, such as Tamil Nadu. Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, and Kerala. While the law is the same for every motorist, women motorists are often spared from baggage checks. Taking advantage of this practice, some gangs are roping in women to dodge the enforcement officials and transport the weed. Women smugglers earn anywhere between Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 per trip. Interestingly, women in the trade do not procure the contraband in bulk, fearing they may land in trouble. While transporting the weed, they use expensive cars to give the impression of visiting Vizag Agency as part of a trip. Meanwhile, in Vizag city, some women also supply weed to students and youngsters. “Though we arrested some peddlers, there are more out there supplying the contraband,” a senior police officer said.

The number of children enrolled in government schools increased from 76.9% in 2020 to 80.5% in 2021, compared to 2.8% rise in the last three years since 2018. The report also revealed that more children from the rural background took admission in the government schools, compared to private schools, between 2018 and 2021. The report was based on a survey conducted in the rural areas of 581 districts across 25 states and 3 union territories between September and October this year. It covered 76,706 households, 75,234 children in 5-16 age group besides teachers and staff of 7,300 government schools. Significantly, the proportion of both boys and girls enrolled in government schools across all grades increased from 2020 to 2021. The percentage of girls enrolled went up from 80.9% in 2020 to 82.9% in 2021 while the boys’ enrolment increased from 73.2% in 2020 to 78.2% this year.  The state education department launched ‘Praveshotsav’ campaign to enrol students in schools, especially from classes I to IX. Education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary said the department conducted a special campaign to ensure 100% enrolment of kids, who attain the age of schooling. “The education officials, teachers, NGOs, leaders at all level (including panchayats) and intellectual society were asked to admit the kids who were out of school. Now, we have the positive results of the campaign,” he told this newspaper. As per the report, the availability of smartphones to the enrolled kids also increased from 27.2% in 2018 to 54.4% in 2021. However, only 11.8% kids have access to studies all the time while 34.4% used the device for limited periods for education purpose. A large section of almost 53.8% enrolled kids still have no electronic devices for studies. Choudhary said the department was aware that maximum kids do not have access to electronic devices and internet facility for online studies. “Digital education has its own limitation in the state. It cannot replace the classroom education because of several challenges. Digital devices may lead to learning divide. The department has sent a proposal to the project approval board of the centrally sponsored Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan to provide electronic learning devices to kids studying in elementary schools,” the minister said. He added: “So far the financial involvement is concerned, states like Bihar cannot bear the cost. So, we have requested the Centre to provide electronic devices to kids for learning purpose.” The report highlighted that 73.5% of the school-going children took tuitions when schools were shut due to the pandemic, while 63.8% took help from family members while studying at home. Such children included 62% of government schools and 76% from private schools. Almost 89.4% kids received textbooks for their current grade compared to 75.8% in 2020, the report stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/enrolment-in-govt-schools-up-by-3-6-in-state-aser/articleshow/87765950.cms||Faryal Rumi

The ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ campaign, which kick-started on Tuesday, will continue till November 27, barring Sunday. Two days will also be utilized for routine immunization along with the Covid-19 vaccination. “It will be like a pulse polio campaign. So, the teams have been formed in such a way that there is one ANM in each team,” said state health department special secretary Sanjay Kumar, who also holds the charge of state society executive director. Apart from one ANM who will work as a vaccinator, there will be one verifier in each team. Three such teams will be headed by a supervisor. Sanjay said each team is to cover 125 houses in a day and all the 18,000 teams nearly 22.50 lakh households every day. As per the data with the department, 7 crore beneficiaries are supposed to take Covid-19 vaccines, but many of them are staying outside the state. “Hence, we expect less than six crore beneficiaries. It may stop by the time we reach 5.50 or 5.60 crore,” said an official. As per the data on CoWIN portal till Wednesday afternoon, over 5.16 crore people had taken first dose and over 2.13 crore their second dose. Majority of the beneficiaries who have not taken the shots are pregnant women. Though doctors said the vaccine was safe for them and the Union government has given its nod, the health department official said they will not force this group for vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/18000-teams-formed-for-door-to-door-vax-drive/articleshow/87765899.cms||Sheezan Nezami

---||Patna||Bihar JD(U) terminates all its 33 cells, units||PATNA: In a major step towards restructuring its organizational set-up, the state JD(U) on Wednesday dissolved all its 33 cells, including Yuva JD(U), Mahila JD(U) and Chhatra JD(U), as well as units right from the block level to the state level. The 33 cells were last reconstituted in March and April this year at the directive of the party’s the then national president Ram Chandra Prasad Singh, commonly known as RCP. Thus, in one stroke thousands of office-bearers, who were believed to be the supporters of RCP, were made designation-less. Moreover, the party removed all the 40 Lok Sabha and 243 Vidhan Sabha kshetra prabharis in the state. All these ‘prabharis’ (in-charge) were appointed on the advice of RCP when he used to control the organization as its national president. “JD(U) state president Umesh Singh Kushwaha has terminated the party’s cells and units as well as the appointment of all Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha kshetra prabharis with immediate effect,” party’s state general secretary (headquarters) Mrityunjay Kumar Singh announced. Although the termination order was officially issued by Kushwaha, insiders said it was done at the directive of the party’s new national president Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh. Lalan became the JD(U)’s national president on July 31, replacing RCP. Soon after taking the command of the party, Lalan expressed his concern over the constitution of “too many” cells. Lalan was of the view that these cells were running parallel units in the districts, leading to confusion among the supporters. Soon after taking over the party’s charge, Lalan had terminated the appointment of Vidhan Sabha prabharis of different cells. He had also put a break on further expansion of different cells in the state. JD(U) state general secretary Mrityunjay Singh told TOI that the cells and their units were terminated after a thorough discussion with the top leaders of the party. He added, “The party has decided to reduce the number of cells. Some of these, which have no political utility, will be closed. Fresh committees will be announced in future.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-terminates-all-its-33-cells-units/articleshow/87766061.cms||Madan Kumar

The park is adjacent to the world heritage Mahabodhi Mahavihara. When contacted, principal secretary of forest department, Dipak Kumar Singh, said, “It is a good initiative of Gaya division. We are also planning such initiative in Patna and other district headquarters. The plan would be executed in the Eco Park at Patna besides some other parks having big areas in Araria, Jamui and other districts.” Gaya divisional forest officer (DFO) Abhishek Kumar said the park will have a managed habitat for butterflies with ample amount of resources for adults and early stages. “It will be additionally supported with an open air interpretation centre to spread awareness among the locals as well as foreign visitors about the conservation of butterflies. The interpretation centre will have interactive information boards having contents on butterfly diversity in Bodh Gaya and ecological importance of butterflies. “The habitat will have designated plots for establishment and maintenance of the resources required for butterflies. Altogether 18,327 square feet area has been selected for intense plantation and remaining part of the park is to be used for isolated and sporadic strategic plantation. More than 4,000 plants of 55 species will be used to set up the habitat in and around the park throughout the year,” the DFO said. Butterflies will breed in the wild and lay eggs in the host resources. A percentage of larvae hatching from those eggs will be collected inside the laboratory. Regular rearing of butterflies will be carried out and freshly enclosed butterflies will be used to conduct butterfly release event. Temperature inside the rearing room will be controlled by airconditioner. The rearing centre will help enhance the number of butterflies in and around. The centre will felicitate the breeding of prominent species of butterfly, including lemon emigrant, common jay, Indian jezebel, blue mormon, common rose, plain tier, blue tiger, plains cupid, psyche, common crow, common leopard, striped tiger, common ciliate blue, commander and grass demon. In the Buddhist texts, the Bodhi tree is known as the tree of awakening under which Lord Buddha attained enlightenment. The tree is scientifically known as ‘Ficus religiasa’, which has an ancient connection with butterflies. Common crow, which is a regular visitor to Jai Prakash Udyan, uses the sacred tree to complete its life cycle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/butterfly-rearing-centre-developed-at-bodh-gaya/articleshow/87765885.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||'Andhra Pradesh can achieve decentralised development through less invasive ways’||VIJAYAWADA: Senior counsel Shyam Diwan appearing for Amaravati farmers on Wednesday concluded his marathon arguments explaining why, according to the petitioners, the legislations on three capital cities are illegal, arbitrary, violative of statutory rights of the farmers and against the doctrine of proportionality. Shyam Diwan submitted various judgements of the Supreme Court in support of his arguments on each ground he raised against the twin legislations. On the third day of arguments, Shyam Diwan said the issue of the capital Amaravati has to be looked at from a national perspective as the Union government provided funds for the development of essential infrastructure in the capital in pursuant to the State Reorganisation Act. After notifying the capital, preparation of master plan, grounding of works and contracts awarded, the state government cannot take a U-turn and stall the project. If laws like this are allowed to continue, no project will be possible as the reputation of the state is at stake. People will not believe any government to pool lands for any developmental works, he said. Arguing how the twin legislations are against the doctrine of proportionality, Shyam Diwan said the state government had already resolved to decentralise the development in 2014 in the assembly by developing three mega cities, including Amaravati as capital and 14 smart cities. Decentralised development can be achieved through less invasive methods without abandoning the existing and ongoing developmental works. The state government cannot destroy the value of the property and take away the right to property of the farmers, he said. Asserting that the twin legislations are manifestly arbitrary, Shyam Diwan said the state government cannot destroy the market that it has created. He said wilful non-adherence to priorities under the master plan in force which are to be completed in a time bound manner is nothing but arbitrary and cannot be allowed. He said the apex court categorically held that a change of policy after change in government cannot be allowed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/state-can-achieve-decentralised-devpt-through-less-invasive-ways/articleshow/87766434.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Subhash Trivedi, in-charge IGP of railways, told media on Wednesday that the procedure to register a case of abetment of suicide with the Valsad railway police station is underway and rape charges will be added after scientific report is available. Generally, a DNA report is made available in around 15 days. After a specific request from the cops in this case, the report is expected to come within three days. The cops are waiting for scientific reports before registering the rape offence so that the accused don’t get any escape window during the legal process, sources said. Currently registration of FIR of abetment of suicide against unidentified is under process. Sources said that police have also found witnesses who saw the girl sitting alone in a coach of the Gujarat Queen Express after it reached Valsad railway station. Giving details of the investigation, Trivedi said that the cops have also questioned accused who had committed sex-related crimes in Vadodara in the past, drug addicts, autorickshaw drivers and other suspicious persons. A few of them have been detained for further questioning, Trivedi added. Trivedi further said that since the case has links with different cities like Vadodara, Navsari, Surat and Valsad, police have collected CCTV footage from different parts of these cities including ST bus stand, railway stations. Sources said that around 35 autorickshaw drivers who operate around Chakli circle, Vaccine Institute ground and near the girl’s residence were questioned so far. Police had also questioned around 55 people including NGO staff, neighbours, security guards, the victim’s friends and others who were in regular touch with the girl. The bicycle which the victim was riding at the time of alleged kidnapping hasn’t been found yet. The girl was on her bicycle near the Vaccine Institute Campus in Vadodara before being allegedly kidnapped and raped by two unidentified persons in Vadodara on October 28. Two days later she arrived at her home in Navsari and during early hours on November 4 she was found hanging in Gujarat Queen Express.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/cops-groping-in-the-dark-about-rape-accused/articleshow/87766203.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Five puppies poisoned to death in north Kolkata locality||KOLKATA: Five puppies were found poisoned to death on Ramdhan Khan Lane in Sovabazar on Wednesday. The carcasses of the puppies, which were around a month old, were discovered by locals early in the morning. The sixth puppy survived the murder attempt and was sent to a pet clinic for treatment. Jorabagan cops said they have received a complaint that all the puppies were poisoned and Kolkata Police has launched a probe into the incident. “We have sent the carcasses for post-mortem and have registered a case under IPC sections 428 and 429 (mischief by killing or maiming animal) that carry a maximum punishment of five years. We have begun studying the CCTV footage of the area. We have tried to link a few locals who were found not in favour of these dogs and have identified a few suspects,” said an officer. Ayushi Dey, an activist who first got to know about the plight of the puppies, rushed to the spot and found five of them dead and one gasping for breath. After making arrangements for urgent treatment, Dey visited Jorabagan police station and lodged an FIR against unknown miscreants. “It is an unpardonable offence and the criminals should not be spared. It was one of the most gruesome killings of puppies I have ever encountered,” Dey told TOI. Jorabagan cops said they will carry out a post-mortem at the state forensic lab to ascertain the exact cause of death. The carcasses have also been preserved for viscera test as advised by a veterinary surgeon who initially examined them. According to a preliminary report, the dogs died of poison in food offered by “unknown persons”. Locals claimed several crows also died after eating the same food. Less than two weeks ago, another dog had died mysteriously in the area. Police said they suspect the stray was killed by a group of people from the nearby slums. “We will intensify our vigil to prevent such incidents,” said an officer. Dog lovers in the area, however, do not feel assured. They said someone who knew the movement of these dogs is involved in the killing. A section of locals blamed the dog lovers’ refusal to allow the relocation of dogs for the present incident. “There are dozens of dogs in the area which are fed by local dog lovers. After dark, these dogs become a nuisance, especially for kids. We have complained to KMC and police about this. Though no one has the right to kill animals, things wouldn’t have reached this point had the dog lovers cooperated with us,” said a local. Animal activists demanded stern action against the culprits. According to a KMC health department official, prevention of cruelty to animals should undergo a major change to book culprits who often don’t think twice before harming a stray dog.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/five-puppies-poisoned-to-death-in-n-kolkata-locality/articleshow/87767287.cms||Saikat Ray

It’s not longer just seasoned corporate executives or wealthy business owners but also mid-level professionals, techies in their thirties flush with hefty salaries and vested ESOPs, and conventional stock market investors joining angel networks and writing cheques to get in early on the action. Angel investment firms told TOI that inquiries and new members have risen by almost 5x in 2021 leading them to conduct more awareness creation for the new kinds of investors and ticket sizes of angel investments too have thus fallen from an average Rs 10-15 lakh to Rs 3-5 lakh. Zomato’s listing appears to be the inflection point for angel investing. “From young techies to senior executives, we are seeing investors who want to write the cheques and get their hands dirty and help startups grow in their early stages,” Padmaja Ruparel, co-founder, Indian Angel Network, said. More women, especially Bollywood actors, are also turning angel investors, she added. Indian Angel Network has over 500 members currently. “People from all walks of life are turning angels today and are part of multiple networks to get access to the deals and invest as well,” Pooja Mehta , CIO, JITO Angel Network, said. JITO has investors from Mysore, Erode, Guntur, Belgaum and Bhilwara, along with metros, she adds, noting that people from tier-5 and -6 have been some of the most active and smart investors. Mumbai Angels has seen inquiries and membership grow from mid- to senior level corporate executives wishing to dabble in this asset class and notes family offices are playing a more hands-on role in their portfolio startups by turning angels besides being LPs to large funds. “While 2020 was our best year ever with 35 deals and 36 exits, we have already surpassed these in 2021,” Nandini Mansinghka, co-founder, Mumbai Angels, said, adding that membership has grown from 500 to 650 in the last two years. Vinay Bansal, founder and CEO, Inflection Point Ventures, says that the firm has seen a 10x growth in member base in the last two years at around 5,500 now with many of them earlier having a 100% allocation to listed markets and now wanting to diversify. Early-stage investment firm LetsVenture says around 150 people used to join the network on a monthly basis earlier and this is up to 450-500 now. The activation rate — the rate at which the new investors make their first bet in the first week — has almost doubled, Nakul Saxena, head — fund strategy & investor relations, LetsVenture, said. “The euphoria of investing has also moved to smaller towns and we are thus increasing our efforts at educating and sensitising the first-time investors of the risks,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/more-indians-turn-angels-in-startup-funding-boom/articleshow/87767006.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

Skyrocketing prices of LPG and raw materials has forced hoteliers in Hubballi to hike prices from 5 to 10 percent. Hoteliers are finding it difficult to raise the prices, fearing low footfalls. After the lockdown was eased, hotels are receiving customers, and now hoteliers are expecting good business in the marriage season. In some hotels prices were hiked while some have hiked prices of premium items like dosa and puris, which require gas and edible oil in larger amounts than other dishes. Hubballi Hotel Association general secretary Ravi Gaitonde said, “Customer flow has still not improved in many areas. Because of rise in prices, the hotel industry was in trouble. There is no option left for hoteliers apart from hiking prices.” “Normally Hubballi Hotel Association will not take any stand on hiking prices. It is left to the hoteliers to take a call based on the circumstances in their area, and some have increased prices by up to 10%,” he said. If hoteliers decide to hike prices, they will calculate their expenses for gas, groceries, power, water, staff salary, building rent and others. Hoteliers will have to increase prices of all items and not just a select few, added Gaitonde. The unhealthy competition, mainly by street vendors and hotels that haven’t taken any license, is also forcing hoteliers to think before hiking prices. Krishnamurthy Uchilla, of Hotel Sri Krishna Bhavan, said they are still working out the prices of dishes. “With Covid-19, the hotel industry was completely hit. Still, we are struggling to stabilize the business. Amidst this, if we hike prices there is fear of losing business,” he said. Ramachandra, a hotel customer said some hotels have already hiked the price of tea to Rs 16 a cup. “One plate of idli is now Rs 35, from Rs 32 earlier. Dosa and poori now cost Rs 50 from the earlier Rs 45. If this situation continues, we will be forced to stop coming to hotels,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/hit-by-inflation-hoteliers-in-twin-cities-unsure-about-revising-prices/articleshow/87765392.cms||J Abbas Mulla

The stretch between the Mumbai-Agra highway near Dahava Mail to Nashik Airport near Janori had developed several potholes. The stretch has got a facelift as a four-lane road has been developed in this stretch. “We have approached district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal, who had instructed the officials to undertake development of the roads towards Airport. There is a need to put up streetlights and signboards along the roads to facilitate air travellers,” said Manish Rawal, chairman, aviation committee, Ambad Industries & Manufacturers’ Association. The industrialists said that the condition of the road has improved, it needs proper signboards and streetlights.

The footfall of Nashik airport has already increased to 7,000 passengers a month after the Covid pandemic. Around 230 passengers are either departing or arriving at the Nashik airport on a daily basis. Now, the Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, which manages the Nashik airport, has developed infrastructure for Immigration Check Post at the airport terminal under the supervision of the Bureau of Immigration, Mumbai. Moreover, HAL has also decided to allow night parking and night landing at the airport.

The association has urged the high court to declare the provision under sub-section 9(b) in Section 125 of the Act as ultra vires. There are more than 6200 members of the association in Bihar. While hearing the writ petition on Wednesday, the division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar directed the state government to file its reply on the matter within four weeks’ time and fixed December 22 for hearing the matter again. The bench also directed the Election Commission of India (ECI) and State Election Commission (SEC) to file their separate replies within the same time period. The association has also prayed that the all requisition orders for deployment of its members in the ongoing panchayat poll be stayed during the pendency of the petition. Senior counsel Amit Srivastava, who appeared for the SEC with Girish Pandey and Sanjeev Nikesh in the matter, countered the association’s plea on the grounds that it was questioning the provision after a gap of 12 years since the amendment came into effect in 2009. He also apprised the court that seven out of the 12 phases of state panchayat elections had already been completed. Srivastava also submitted that the SEC acts as per the law, which has been enacted by the state legislature and the commission has no role in forming or amending it. The association was represented by Apurv Harsh, Manu Tripurari, Sujit Kumar and Prashant Bhordwaj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sbi-officers-body-challenges-deployment-in-rural-elections/articleshow/87765834.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The district recorded 49 cases per day on average between November 1 and 15 as compared to 78 cases in October. While the number of active cases has reduced from 618 on October 31 to 425 at present. Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the medical superintendent of Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), said the immunity in individuals coupled with vaccination has helped in preventing the rise of cases post-Diwali. The infectivity of the coronavirus has reduced and the Covid positivity rate has also dropped below 0.5%. Moreover, around 81% of the beneficiaries in Nashik city have been vaccinated partially or fully, he said. The infection is still there and everyone must continue to wear masks and maintain social distancing, he said. Even though the cases have reduced, people still need to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour in public. Dr Raj Nagarkar, the vice-president of the Private Hospital Owners Association in Nashik, has expressed similar views. According to NMC hospital officials, the bulk of the fresh Covid patients are those who are not vaccinated. Meanwhile, the daily cases of Covid in the city have reduced to 24 cases per day on an average between November 1 and 16, against 28 cases per day in October. The active cases in Nashik city have reduced from 233 on October 31 to 165 so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/drop-in-new-covid-cases-in-nashik/articleshow/87765145.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Patna||HC seeks govt’s reply on criteria to appoint HMs||PATNA: The Patna high court on Wednesday sought the state government’s reply on its eligibility criteria for appointment of a teacher as headmaster (HM) in nationalised senior secondary schools. The division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar, while hearing a writ petition filed by TET-STET Uttirn Niyojit Shikshak Sangh challenging the validity of various provisions in the Bihar State Senior Secondary School Headmaster (Appointment, Transfer, Disciplinary, Proceeding and Service Condition) Rules, 2021, directed the state government to reply on the issues raised in the petition within four weeks’ time. It also directed the petitioner to file rejoinder, if any, within the same time frame and fixed January 19 as the next date of hearing. The petitioner has challenged the condition of eight years’ experience of a teacher for appointment as headmaster in the senior secondary section on the grounds that the government has appointed aspiring TET qualified candidates since 2014 and in no situation they will have the required tenure of experience. In addition to this, the association has also challenged the provision of no requirement of TET qualification for those candidates who have been appointed as teachers before 2012. It has also apprised the court that such classification is unreasonable and will lead to a situation that none of the headmasters getting appointed for nationalised schools will be TET or STET qualified. The petitioner has also cited the National Education Policy, 2020, in which TET qualification is a must for teachers’ appointment. The teachers’ association has termed these provisions for recruitment as a poor attempt to lower the quality of education in the state. The court didn’t bar the state government from initiating recruitment process, but observed that the final appointments of candidates as headmasters in senior secondary schools would depend on the decision in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-seeks-govts-reply-on-criteria-to-appoint-hms/articleshow/87765912.cms||Debashish Karmakar

IMA secretary Dr Sunil Kumar told this newspaper that more than 200 doctors in the state had died during the pandemic and their family members were entitled to get a sum of Rs 50 lakh from the “Insurance scheme for health workers fighting Covid-19” under the Prime Minister’s Poor Welfare Package. “However, hardly 20% of the families of the deceased have been paid the money till date,” Kumar said.

---||Patna||RJD mocks state prohibition policy||PATNA: One day after review of the implementation of the state’s prohibition policy done by CM Nitish Kumar, the RJD brass led by leader of opposition in the state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Wednesday mocked the exercise and the decisions taken. They even fell short of demanding that the prohibition policy be revoked. While the hooch has claimed over 65 lives this month, the mafia elements run a liquor smuggling network, which has spread down to the village level. To short-circuit the import, distribution and consumption of the illegally procured liquor, a slew of decisions was taken at the Tuesday’s meeting while activating the village-level chowkidars to pass on the information about liquor availability and consumption in their villages concerned. Calling the review meeting as “so-called,” Tejashwi, who had raised 15 questions on Tuesday, tweeted on Wednesday: “If he (read CM) is serious about prohibition, then he should not have feared the real questions that reflect the ground reality, nor should he shy away from them.” Unlike Tejashwi, senior RJD functionary and former Rajya Sabha member Shivanand Tiwary mocked at not only the prohibition policy, but also called it impractical and shorn of any proper assessment of the ground situation. “If a leader is strong, he will get the proper impact assessment of his policy done. If the impact is negative, he withdraws the policy. Unlike that, a weak leader, fearing the likely dent in his image and authority, becomes adamant on continuing the policy even if it is flawed,” Tiwary said, falling short of saying that the prohibition policy should be withdrawn. He suggested that the Nitish government had failed in the implementation of the prohibition policy and, in fact, the policy is flawed and has failed in preventing the consumption of liquor in the state. In contrast, road construction department minister Nitin Navin said the CM’s review meeting was aimed at toning up the police force and the administration, as laxity in implementing the prohibition will not be tolerated. “Our government is transparent. Mass awareness campaign will also be conducted,” Navin said, and upbraided Tejashwi saying that “only those who indulge in wrongdoing will say that the prohibition policy has failed.” But, citing the National Family Health Survey report, Tiwary said more liquor is consumed in Bihar than in Maharashtra, which is not a dry state. “Between 2005 and 2016, the Nitish government first made the Biharis habitual liquor consumer, and then imposed the prohibition policy,” Tiwary said, adding that the CM should explain the number of outlets which were selling foreign and country liquor in the state before the imposition of the prohibition policy and also the quantum of revenue loss that the government has suffered. While around 3 lakh poor and Dalits have been put behind bars, it has also put an additional burden on the police force that has neglected the basic policing duty regarding crime control and police investigation, as also on the courts and the state’s prisons, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-mocks-state-prohibition-policy/articleshow/87765989.cms||Abhay Singh

The need for another bus terminal is felt to decongest the Patliputra Bus Terminal located at Mauza Pahadi on the Patna-Gaya road. The buses will be geographically divided between the existing bus terminal and the proposed one. During the inspection, the CM had discussions about decongesting the city roads and streamline interstate and intercity bus routes. Focusing on Patna’s future plan, the officials believed that another bus terminal at Bihta will be more feasible as the alignment of six-lane ring road will touch the location. Besides, an elevated road is under construction at Bihta where the second airport is also proposed. The operation of buses coming from northwest Bihar, Rohtas, Kaimur, Buxar, Bhojpur, Ara, Chappra and adjoining Uttar Pradesh and few city buses from there will be more feasible with the propects of developing the greater Patna. However, the CM will take the final call on this matter. The land requirement for the second bus terminal will be finalized by the district administration and the urban development and housing department. The area will be selected after considering different aspects to provide better transportation facilities to the commuters. The state transport department will prepare the transport mobility plan with all the stakeholders for the new bus terminal. According to sources, over 3,000 buses operate in Patna per day and more than 1,800 buses ply from the Patliputra Bus Terminal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-inspects-sites-for-another-bus-terminal/articleshow/87766006.cms||Faryal Rumi

It will not be a call from the senior officials of the police department, but from an accused of a cheating case. Strange, it may sound but the accused, a realtor from Anand, has been ordered to mark his presence before police through online means as the court allowed him to travel to Dubai for business purposes for one year. The accused Sanjay Shah, who is accused of cheating several people in a housing scheme in Waghodiya, was allowed conditional bail in February. He was asked to deposit his passport with the court, mark his presence every Monday and Thursday at Waghodiya police station and not leave India. But last month, Shah approached the court again to modify his bail conditions as he planned to travel to Dubai for business purpose. He told the court that he holds license in Dubai to carry out commercial business there so his condition of depositing passport with court and not travelling outside India be deleted or modified for a period of five years. The court of additional sessions judge A J Kanani allowed his application and modified the condition for a period of one year against a deposit of Rs 1 lakh before the trial court. Shah was, however, not allowed to not mark his police presence so the court asked him to make WhatsApp call on Monday and Thursday at 11 am to the sub-inspector and also share his Google location with the cop. The sub-inspector has also been asked to report the court about this exercise at the end of every month until Shah returns to India and deposits his passport back. Shah has also been asked to keep his mobile phone switched on all the time and also share landline numbers and two mobile phone numbers of his Dubai office manager or office staff to the cop and court before travelling to Dubai. The sub-inspector has been asked to provide a copy of the order to the Indian Embassy in Dubai for their information.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/mark-presence-with-police-via-video-call-from-dubai/articleshow/87766295.cms||Jay Pachchigar

Students from these schools will appear for the CBSE exam for Class X in the 2024-25 academic year. After the state government introduced the new education system as part of the New Education Policy, the state reorganised the school structure and introduced CBSE and English medium. Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy reviewed the education department with officials at his Tadepalli camp office on Wednesday, where officials said the new education system would be implemented in three phases from 2021 to 2024. They further said 25,396 primary schools will be merged with upper primary and high schools. In the first phase, 2,663 schools have been merged this year and the new education system introduced. The chief minister instructed officials to set up a special number to be prominently displayed at schools, for parents and guardians to report any issues that they face, and receive relevant updates/solutions. All issues logged through this number will be reviewed, and wherever necessary, officials will take action. The chief minister instructed officials to pay special attention to English, specifically aspects like pronunciation, diction, grammar, and accent. As dictionaries have been provided to all students, the chief minister said all students should learn three new words a day and how to use those words while speaking/writing. Speaking on aided schools, the chief minister stated that the handing over of aided schools to the government is completely voluntary. The government is providing an opportunity to entities that are not able to run their school to merge with government schools, and the aim is to ensure that children are provided with good education and quality facilities. The chief minister clarified that there is no compulsion for aided schools to merge and that it was inappropriate to bring politics into this.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cbse-gives-affiliation-to-1092-govt-schools/articleshow/87766450.cms||Gopi Dara

---||Kolkata||Covid jab camp at Eco Park for unvaccinated visitors||Kolkata: The New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) has started a Covid vaccination camp at the Eco Park dispensary in New Town, primarily for visitors who will arrive at the gates without vaccination. Hidco officials said that since Eco Park was reopened, it has been noticed that there have been many unvaccinated visitors. Looking into this, Hidco discussed with NKDA if spot vaccination could be done for such visitors before entering Eco Park. “The modalities were sorted out and the spot vaccination camp has started at the Eco Park dispensary. Five such visitors were vaccinated on Tuesday and this will now continue,” said an official. However, since 10 persons can be vaccinated from one vial, at least eight to 10 unvaccinated visitors would need to be there, officials said. “The visitors will have to wait till at least eight to 10 of them come,” said an official. NKDA have also started doorstep vaccination for the elderly and senior citizens in New Town following several requests from those who cannot step out of their houses to get their dose due to their old age or other health issues. A total of 27 such residents have been vaccinated at home in New Town till Tuesday. Family members of those who are getting vaccinated at home are happy over the arrangements. “My maternal grandfather is 88 years old and has multiple health issues. We were apprehensive that taking him out for vaccination may result in some other repercussions. He is also unable to move around much. So we were waiting for such a doorstep vaccination initiative. It was a very seamless process from sending a mail to NKDA to finally getting vaccinated. The entire process was completed within two to three days,” said Arijit Samaddar, whose grandfather Haripada Saha got the jab at his home in New Town. NKDA earlier conducted off-site vaccination camps at a few gated communities in the township and also conducted a vaccination on wheels drive to inoculate hawkers and street vendors. In adjacent Salt Lake, the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) has already inoculated over 95% of people with their first dose and is also trying to take up doorstep vaccination for those who cannot step out of their houses. BMC ward 31 authorities recently inoculated a few such elderly persons at their home. “My father, who is 84 years old, has suffered from a stroke and is bed ridden. He is also a two-time Covid survivor. Due to his immobile condition we could not take him anywhere to give him the jab. He will be benefited if such doorstep vaccination could be conducted,” said Sankha Subhra Chowdhury, a resident of Salt Lake IA block. Award for BMC The BMC on Tuesday received the Gold Skoch Award for municipal governance for Covid management. Dedicating the award to the citizens of Bidhannagar, BMC board of administrators’ chairperson Krishna Chakraborty said it was a joint effort and dedicated work of all the civic officials towards achieving the recognition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covid-jab-camp-at-eco-park-for-unvaccinated-visitors/articleshow/87766763.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The project is initiated as part of the Haritha Jeevanam scheme. The mission is to convert the university grounds into a fully carbon free campus. The programme aims at reducing the carbon content in the atmosphere by not letting the vehicles go inside the campus. For that, electric buggy cars, electric scooters and bicycles will be available in the campus. The people coming to the campus, including the students and faculties, must park their vehicles on the space allocated and have to take this electronic vehicle to travel to their respective departments. These vehicles will be available at the campus entrance itself. The service will be free of cost. Currently, there is one electric buggy car, two electric scooters and 75 bicycles. The electric buggy car can accommodate 11 passengers at a time. The authorities are planning to launch two more electric buggy cars and a few more bicycles in the campus grounds as part of the initiative. The new electric vehicles were purchased by using the university fund. They have also got donations from the alumni of the school of distance education. “The carbon free campus is for our upcoming generations. Our mission is to make the university grounds totally carbon free. “The campus is changing to a platform for the students to keep themselves happy. It is making facilities for the students to get a better atmosphere to study. This is the first stage of the project. We will include more electric vehicles and bicycles for the students, faculties and other people in the next stage,” said S Nazeeb, project coordinator. “Kerala University is setting an example by promoting this idea. Air pollution is one of the major issues we face at this juncture and I am happy to know as an alumnus that this wonderful initiative was put forward by the college which I had studied,” said Antony Raju, transport minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kerala-varsity-campus-on-carbon-free-path/articleshow/87766737.cms||---

With an existing centre in Madurai’s ELCOT region of 1,000 seats, Neeyamo’s second office is set to have an additional capacity of 1,600 seats at an additional 65,000 square feet in size. The company did not disclose the investment in the expansion. Neeyamo looks to ramp up its headcount in the Madurai region by around 1,200 persons in the year ahead, it said. The Madurai centre will focus on all of Neeyamo’s key lines of business including global payroll transformation, and the company said the talent there would be involved in the same work being done in Chennai , the US and other locations in “building cutting-edge global payroll products.” Neeyamo’s team in Madurai comprises technology specialists, implementation experts, compliance experts and customer support executives to support global clients. “We believe companies should create jobs where the talent is located rather than bringing the talent to the cities. We’ve identified around 20 cities to be remote delivery centres including cities in the Northeast, and we will look to expand in these locations in the next 12 months,” Rangarajan Seshadri, CEO of Neeyamo, told TOI.“When we started our first Madurai centre, we realised that there weren’t many companies based out of Madurai. We had a good number of people working in our Chennai centre that came from Madurai and neighbouring towns/cities that made us realise the uncaptured talent that Madurai had to offer. We are very pleased with the talent in Madurai. Culturally, people are very humble and grounded. The energy levels in our Madurai centre inspires all of us at Neeyamo,” he added. Neeyamo has around 3,000 employees covering more than 190 countries. It serves more than 350 customers worldwide. The company has increased its employee count from 1,500 to 3,000 in the pandemic year, it said, adding that 80% of this is in smaller cities including Madurai, Thanjavur, Nagpur, Belgaum and Aurangabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hr-tech-firm-neeyamo-expands-to-madurai/articleshow/87767027.cms||Sindhu Hariharan
---||Kolkata||Bihar man nursed back to health, reunited with family on Chhath||Kolkata: A man who had been born after prolonged prayers and prostrations before Chhathi Maiya and had gone missing for several years, was reunited with his family on the day of Chhath Puja. The Bihar resident — Manoj Paswan — was handed over to his relatives by the members of the Missionaries of Charity Nabajiban Mother Teresa Home in Howrah. Paswan’s life is almost like a work of fiction. He allegedly faced near-death situations on a number of occasions. “While in his mother’s womb, his life was in danger and the doctors were worried. His mother decided to perform Chhath Puja despite warnings from the doctors. After the puja, she went into labour,” said Ambarish Nag Biswas of West Bengal Radio Club. The club was instrumental in tracing Paswan’s relatives to Rajouli village in Banka district of Bihar. As Paswan grew up, he started showing symptoms of an unbalanced mind. A few years ago, he went missing. Two years ago, he was spotted by the sisters at the Missionaries of Charity in Kolkata. “He was lying on the pavement in a senseless state. He was on the verge of dying when we rescued him,” recounted brother Sajan Joseph of the Nabajiban Home. Over the next few months, Paswan underwent treatment, including psychological therapy. “Gradually we began to see signs of recovery in him. We decided to get him engaged in feeding other patients. Later, he started assisting in the kitchen. A few months ago, we felt that he had recovered a lot and could now stay with his family,” Joseph said. Joseph contacted the Radio Club and sought their help. The members of the club shared Paswan’s photograph over a network and his family was found. Paswan’s family members, who had lost hope of getting him back, broke into tears when they received the call. On Chhath day, they arrived in Kolkata and a healthy Paswan welcomed them with a smile at the Howrah Home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bihar-man-nursed-back-to-health-reunited-with-family-on-chhath/articleshow/87767452.cms||Rohit Khanna

---||Business||Invesco puts off blockchain fund plan over regulatory flux||Mumbai: Invesco Mutual Fund on Wednesday said that it has deferred the launch of its CoinShares Global Blockchain ETF fund of funds (FoF), which was scheduled to open for subscription on November 24. The fund house cited recent meetings between lawmakers and participants in the country’s ‘digital assets industry’. Invesco had announced the scheme where the underlying fund invests in listed equities of companies in developed and emerging markets that participate in the blockchain ecosystem. According to Invesco, the government meetings are likely to culminate in a new legislative framework being formulated. “In light of the above, we believe it is important for investors to fully understand all aspects before making long-term investment decisions,” a statement issued by the fund said. It added that new launch dates would be announced later. Invesco Asset Management (India) manages over Rs 53,747 crore across mutual funds, portfolio management services and offshore advisory schemes. It is an arm of the Atlanta-headquartered Invesco Group. Sebi had this week cleared the CoinShares Global Blockchain ETF FoF — the first such investment vehicle from India. CoinShares Group promotes digital asset investing and was the first to launch a regulated bitcoin investment fund in 2014. It also offered the world’s first bitcoin-based securities on a regulated exchange in 2015. The objective of the FoF was to invest in Ireland-based Invesco CoinShares Global Blockchain UCITS ETF. The joint venture fund holds a stake in bitcoin mining companies and crypto exchanges. This week, representatives of the industry dealing with cryptocurrencies met a Parliamentary standing committee on finance headed by BJP MP Jayant Sinha and called for regulating the cryptocurrencies as a ban could not be implemented. While the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has taken the stand that cryptocurrencies are a serious threat to financial stability, it has not been able to ban them after the Supreme Court overturned the central bank’s decision prohibiting banks from dealing with crypto exchanges. Reports that India has over 10 crore crypto owners had raised an alarm, although RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said that the numbers appeared to be exaggerated and that a majority of investors have bought only small amounts. He said that there was an attempt to establish that investment in crypto assets was widespread, which was not the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/invesco-puts-off-blockchain-fund-plan-over-regulatory-flux/articleshow/87767671.cms||---

Cricket fans began gathering outside the stadium’s gates by 3 pm, leading to snarls on Janpath, Lal Kothi, and Rambagh. Police chetaks and PCR vans, with loudspeakers, kept reminding fans to move away from the middle of the road outside the stadium as it was hindering the vehicular movement. As fans kept pouring in from all directions, traffic had slowed to a crawl by 4pm along major roads leading to the stadium, especially on Hawa Sadak and Sodala. Besides long snarls on Tonk Road and Rambagh circle, traffic moved bumper-to-bumper on Bhagwan Das Road on Sahakar Marg as evening peak hour traffic coincided with supporters heading for the sporting event. As the stadium began to fill in with fans, police had set up barricades to enforce one-way movement on Pankaj Singhvi Marg Road behind the stadium. The traffic situation had improved by 8.30 pm as many spectators had already entered the stadium, while evening congestion saw some respite on Rambagh Circle and Lal Kothi. Over 2,000 cops were drawn from different units to help maintain traffic and law-and-order during the match.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/residents-throng-sms-stadium-for-india-new-zealand-t-20-match/articleshow/87768213.cms||---
---||Business||Business correspondent FIA Global aims to be a neobank for inclusion||Mumbai: FIA Global, which provides banking correspondent services to a host of banks, is positioning itself as a neobank for financial inclusion by expanding the range of credit and investment services to the excluded. The company, which has four crore customers and has been digitally transferring over Rs 22,000 crore annually, has applied to set up a non-banking finance company (NBFC) to grow its lending business. Seema Prem, co-founder and CEO, FIA Global told TOI that the company has been able to leverage the small transaction data using artificial intelligence (AI) to optimise operations, enhance customer service and detect fraud. It employs cognitive AI, facial recognition & imaging and natural language processing to deliver financial products at scale to promote inclusion. The technology helps the company to predict the needs in a particular area, the cash requirement after netting deposits and advances, do cashless loan collections and also deliver investment and insurance services. However, unlike most fintechs the company will depend on feet on the street and partners to provide assisted digital banking services. The business correspondent aims to handhold the underprivileged customer to do every transaction offline that can be done through digital banking. “Although we are a late entrant having started operations in 2012, we are present in 700 districts and have over 350 community partners and over 25,000 banking outlets,” said Prem. It is also the largest non-bank facilitator of cross-border monetary transfer from India to Nepal. The game-changer has been the PM Jan Dhan Yojana, which gave a lot of visibility to the rural business thanks to the publicity given by the government. Demonetisation in 2016 gave a boost to digital and financial inclusion. She added that the pandemic has increased the focus on social security through a push for government schemes. According to Prem, FIA Global operates in areas where banks are not able to due to remoteness. Also, these areas are not serviced by ATMs as servicing of the machines is not feasible in these areas. Given that the business correspondent channel is cheaper than ATMs and can now extend services to new areas. Nine of the 12 public sectors have already partnered with IFA Global in addition to a few in the private sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/business-correspondent-fia-global-aims-to-be-a-neobank-for-inclusion/articleshow/87767772.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Business||Agarwal to split metals, oil biz from Vedanta||Mumbai: Metals tycoon Anil Agarwal plans to separate the aluminium, oil & gas and iron & steel businesses from Vedanta to form three separate entities as he reviews the flagship’s corporate structure. The Rs 86,863-crore Vedanta has a play in more than half a dozen segments including zinc, lead & silver, copper, and power. The biggest revenue contributor to Vedanta in fiscal 2021 was aluminium followed by zinc, lead & silver, and copper. Agarwal has appointed a group of Vedanta directors and external advisers to evaluate the spin-off proposal in order to unlock value within the commodity behemoth’s corporate structure. This, according to Agarwal, will create three independent companies, each benefiting from greater focus, tailored capital allocation based on business-specific dynamics, and strategic flexibility to drive long-term growth and value for all stakeholders. Agarwal’s latest plan comes a year after his move to delist Vedanta failed. A tighter grip over the cash-rich Indian commodity giant will help Agarwal reduce liabilities at his holding company. The metals tycoon didn’t specify a timeline for the proposed demerger. The move, said Vedanta, will also accelerate its plans to cut carbon emissions. “Many funds may not like to invest in Vedanta because the aluminium business’s carbon footprint is higher. Having separate entities may attract a broader and wider range of investors in their other businesses,” Dolat Capital Market analyst Prashanth Kumar told Bloomberg News. Vedanta has targeted to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and has pledged $5 billion over the next 10 years to accelerate this transition. The company’s shares more than trebled over the past year, from Rs 108 to Rs 338 now, as commodity prices rallied and demand for alloys boomed globally. Its market capitalisation on the BSE grew to nearly Rs 1.3 lakh crore from Rs 39,904 crore in a year. On Wednesday, the Vedanta stock closed 1.8% higher by end of trade on the BSE.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/agarwal-to-split-metals-oil-biz-from-vedanta/articleshow/87767688.cms||Reeba Zachariah

As per IMD records, this was only the second time in a decade that the city recorded such high minimum temperature for November. The last time minimum temperature scaled this high for the month was in the year 2018, when it touched 27.4 degrees. Wednesday’s minimum temperature recorded by the IMD Santacruz observatory was 5.5 degrees above normal. The IMD Colaba observatory recorded a minimum temperatures of 26 degrees which was 3.3 degrees above normal. Apart from the high minimum temperatures, the high humidity levels also added to the discomfort. The relative humidity recorded by the IMD Colaba and Santacruz observatory was 92% and 85%, respectively. This was higher as compared to a day ago when the IMD Colaba and Santacruz observatory recorded humidity of 84% and 65%, respectively. While the rest of the day continued to stay overcast, by evening a slight drizzle was recorded in most parts of the city such as Dadar, Goregaon, Ghatkopar, Andheri, Lower Parel and Malad. Citizens said the unseasonal rains took them by surprise. In the 12 hours ending 8.30pm on Wednesday, IMD Colaba observatory recorded 3mm rain, while the Santacruz observatory recorded 1.2mm. The highest 24-hour rain recorded in the month of November was 46.3mm in the year 2019. “Despite November rain, the weather is hot and uncomfortable. Hoping to get some relief from the sultry weather,” said a resident. As per IMD forecast, light rain and thundershower activity will continue till Thursday, but the weekend is likely to see dry weather conditions again. IMD said the drizzle was due to a low pressure area over east central Arabian sea off Goa and Karnataka coast. Meanwhile, the maximum temperatures recorded by the IMD Colaba and Santacruz observatory was 31.5 degree and 34.5 degree Celsius, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/whims-of-weather-mumbai-goes-from-being-hot-to-cold-to-hot-again/articleshow/87767641.cms||Richa Pinto

Track the pollution level in your citySeveral districts in the state are having ‘poor’ or ‘very poor’ air quality despite being far off from Delhi and Punjab where vehicular movement and stubble burning are some of the major reasons for smog. Jodhpur, which is quite far from Delhi, is also witnessing a deterioration in air quality. On Wednesday, Jodhpur’s AQI was 274, which is categorised as ‘poor’, in comparison with Jaipur’s 301, which is categorised as ‘very poor.’ The AQI in Udaipur was 286, Kota (334), Bhiwadi (356) and Alwar (141). Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board officials have attributed the deteriorating air quality to weather conditions. “Adverse weather conditions is a major reason for deteriorating air quality. Jodhpur’s air is sometimes poor and sometimes very poor and it is happening because pollutants in the air are not dispersing due to adverse weather conditions. Once weather improves, pollutants will disperse easily and the air quality will improve,” said Amit Sharma, regional officer (Jodhpur). In Jaipur, officials claimed that with the onset of winter, it becomes difficult for pollutants to disperse. Places where pollution is continuously adding up due to vehicular movement, dust, industrial pollution, construction activities and other such activities due to adverse weather, it does not disperse.

Only the ophthalmology and dental OPs were having doctors when the minister reached there at 8.20 am. Even though there was a long queue of patients at medicine OP there was not even a single doctor to attend them. Interestingly the board outside the gynaecology OP read ‘no OP today’. The minister later found that the hospital has seven doctors in the gynaecology department of this hospital, but none were present at OP. The hospital authorities were taken by surprise when the minister reached the hospital in the car of the director of health services. The authorities informed the minister that all the doctors were doing the rounds in the wards and hence they have not reached the OPs. The minister soon went to the wards with the hospital heads and found out that no doctors were present there. Till 9 am no doctors reported for duties at the OP wings even though the OP starts at 8 am in the government hospitals. The minister who verified the case sheets of the wards also found that the doctors are not having rounds in the wards regularly. The minister who fumed at the hospital heads urged the director of health services who had accompanied her to take strict actions against them. The minister also sought an immediate report from the DHS. The patients who have been waiting for the doctors raised several complaints to the minister and several of them spoke about the lack of government treatment benefits at this hospital. The minister who spent almost two hours in the hospital also noted that there was no ECG technician available at the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/health-min-makes-surprise-visit-to-district-hospital/articleshow/87766759.cms||---

Sonali Ambardekar said the attendant distracted her from noticing the meter reading which has to start from zero. “The attendant pretended my car fuel tank was not opening. He wasted 5-7 minutes on telling me to start the engine, shut and start again. I kept going in and out of my car. Suddenly, he shouted that the cap of the tank had opened and started filling up fuel,” she said. When she checked the meter, it was past Rs 500 so she complained to the attendant, who kept repeating how difficult it was to open the cap. Ambardekar then protested after which the attendant filled up fuel for up to Rs3,000 and went away. She complained to the supervisor who swiped her card for Rs2,500. “Did they know I was being fleeced? I want people arriving at pumps to be alert and ensure they are not cheated,” she said.

Zonta Infratech, the private firm which is to carry out the biomining, has submitted the project implementation plan and social impact assessment (SIA) report to the state government, pollution control board (PCB) and Kochi corporation. Once these agencies and government give the nod, the work can be started within a few days, officials with the firm said. “We have submitted the project implementation plan and SIA report. Now, we are waiting for approval from PCB, Kochi corporation and the government. If everything goes as expected, the work can be started by mid-December,” an official with the private firm said. “The legacy waste is piled up in around 40 acres at Brahmapuram. As per our projection, around 32 acres can be freed and made usable for other purpose when we complete biomining,” the official said. The major advantage of clearing the garbage is that it will help reduce pollution of river Kadambrayar. As of now, leachate from the solid waste treatment plant and garbage stacked in the area is percolating into Kadambrayar which passes by. As per studies, around 5.5 lakh metric tonnes of legacy waste is there at Brahmapuram. The waste will be treated in a scientific manner so as to remove undigested organic matter. Then, the garbage will be screened or filtered. The plan is to use mobile screening machines — a system consisting of conveyors and screens or filters — for sorting out various types of waste. “If we use the conventional trommel machine, only around 10 tonnes of waste can be sorted a day. While using mobile screening machine, we will be able to sort at least 200 tonnes a day. We plan to use two mobile screening machines and expect to clear at least 50,000 tonnes of waste a month. If we can work extra hours, we will be able to clear around 70% of waste within five months of starting the work,” a source said. “We won’t be able to sort the garbage during rainy season. Clearing the remaining waste can be started only after the monsoon subsides in October-November, 2022. After June 22, we plan to focus on capping of non-reusable garbage,” he said. Around eight acres is required for capping non-biodegradable waste. Big pits will be dug up in the eight acres and polythene cover will be laid on the surface of the pit so that the waste won’t come into direct contact with the soil. A layer of soil or landfill waste will be laid over the non-biodegradable waste. Hazardous chemicals will be given to the hazardous waste treatment plant at Ambalamugal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/biomining-likely-to-start-next-month/articleshow/87766774.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Jaipur||Director of private firm nabbed in RSLDC racket||JAIPUR: Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) on Wednesday arrested a senior official of a private company in the Skill and Livelihoods Development Corporation (RSLDC) bribery racket. ACB officials said that one Abhinav Sisodiya was arrested for his alleged involvement in seeking a bribe from the complainant. “He is a director of a private company that oversees the operation of the corporation. Two representatives of the same company, Badri Nath Sunder and Akash Kirodi were arrested earlier because they had sought a bribe from the complainant by promising to remove the firm from the blacklist,” the official said. The ACB claimed that Sunder and Kirodi had made the WhatsApp call while Sisodiya was booked because he had provided the number of the complainant. “Sunder and Kirodi demanded a hefty bribe, but the complaint said he could only offer Rs 2.5 lakh, but the duo replied that it was a very small amount,” the official said. ACB had busted the bribery racket in September when sleuths arrested scheme coordinator Ashok Sangwan and an assistant lecturer who was on deputation as a manager of the corporation Rahul Kumar Garg. Both were arrested while taking a bribe of Rs 5 lakh. The agency had also seized the mobile phones of two IAS officers — chairman Neeraj K Pawan and MD Pradeep Gawande — to probe their role. Officials said besides the two officials, the probe is underway against several other persons for their alleged involvement in the racket. A charge sheet was recently filed before the court on November 10 in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/director-of-a-private-firm-nabbed-in-rsldc-racket/articleshow/87768226.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Air pollution major cause of COPD: Docs||Jaipur: Air pollution may lead to difficulty in breathing. On the World COPD Day (November 17), doctors claimed that air pollution was one of the major reasons for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Doctors say that COPD commonly occurs due to significant exposure to noxious particles or gases. It is being increasingly recognised that women who use chulha or biogas for cooking purposes (common in rural areas), are at a high risk of COPD. In addition to that, exposure to air pollution, occupational factors and repeated respiratory infections increase the risk of COPD. “Persistent exposure to the risk factors and repeated respiratory infections can aggravate the underlying COPD leading to a lung attack. The lack of awareness on COPD contributes significantly in preventing people from seeking help and reaching out to their doctors. Identifying the signs and symptoms of COPD and lung attack, and getting timely help from a physician is the best way to prevent further worsening of disease progression. If smokers and other people with risk factors understand that they can get a lung attack which requires urgent medical attention, they will seek help early. Timely diagnosis of the disease is important which can be done by regularly checking lung function in patients who are symptomatic and at risk of COPD,” said Dr Virendra Singh, pulmonologist and former superintendent, SMS Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/air-pollution-major-cause-of-copd-docs/articleshow/87768224.cms||---
---||Nashik||Nashik mayor gives nod to hire staff on honorarium||Nashik: After a marathon debate between the ruling BJP and the opposition, city mayor Satish Kulkarni gave his nod to hire temporary staff on honorarium basis on Wednesday. Mayor directed the civic administration to hire temporary staff in all the departments of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) as per the norms and at the earliest. Leaders of the BJP and the opposition, led by Shiv Sena, were engaged in a fierce verbal spat during the general body meeting on this issue. The opposition members vehemently opposed the proposal claiming that it was an agenda of the BJP in view of the upcoming civic elections. The Sena leaders said that the code of conduct for the civic election will come into effect by the year-end and it would not be possible to complete the recruitment formalities in this short span. The leader of the opposition from Shiv Sena, Ajay Boraste, said that recruitment has not taken place in the civic body during the last 20 years. “The BJP had brought proposals to recruit staff on honorarium basis four times during the last four years, but the civic administration ignored the proposals in this connection,” he said. NMC officials informed that there are 7,717 approved posts and 2,979 of these are vacant. The administrative cost of the civic body, which was 29.83% in 2019-20, has increased to 37.90% in 2020-21 and 38.29% in 2021-22 due to Covid pandemic and implementation of the seventh pay commission to the NMC employees. Congress’ senior corporator Hemlata Patil questioned the move when the administrative cost is over 35%. Sudhakar Badgujar of Shiv Sena said the civic administration will have to send the proposal to the state government for its approval. Mayor said the recruitment could not be done earlier as the priority was to save people from Covid. Finally, the general body gave its approval.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-mayor-gives-nod-to-hire-staff-on-honorarium/articleshow/87765189.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Delhi||BJP targets Delhi govt on handling of air pollution crisis||NEW DELHI: BJP on Wednesday hit out at chief minister Arvind Kejriwal over the Delhi government’s handling of the pollution crisis in the capital, alleging that it had spent more on promoting the bio-decomposer solution than it did on purchasing it. Citing an RTI reply and also an answer provided by the Delhi government in the assembly, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra claimed that the AAP government had spent Rs 40,000 on purchasing the decomposer from Pusa and 310 farmers in the capital had benefited from it. Patra said the Kejriwal government had spent a huge amount on "educating" farmers across the country about the product. He accused the Delhi CM of blaming other states for the problem while doing little himself. Patra said that if farmers of Punjab and Haryana were the responsible for the air pollution in Delhi, then these two states should also have been more polluted than the capital. He noted that the Supreme Court had also pulled up the city government for its attempt to blame municipal bodies, which are run by BJP. Delhi BJP president Adesh Kumar Gupta, who was also present at the press conference, accused Kejriwal of dealing with the crisis "casually" and noted that most of the promises he had made to tackle the issue remain unfulfilled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-targets-delhi-govt-on-handling-of-crisis/articleshow/87767677.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kochi corporation fails to use 110 acres productively||KOCHI: Despite owning around 110 acres at Brahmapuram, Kochi corporation authorities have failed to use the property in an effective and profitable manner. Ironically, the property has become a burden for the cash-strapped corporation. Of the total 110 acres, more than 65% of the land remains unused. At the same time, the local body has the huge responsibility of paying the additional compensation of around Rs 160 crore to land owners whose holdings were bought in 2009. Originally, the corporation had purchased around 35 acres at Brahmapuram for setting up a solid waste treatment plant during 2005-06 period. After starting the waste treatment plant on the said premises, local residents came up with protests demanding the government to take over their holdings also. The residents’ argument was that they are unable to live there due to the foul smell emanating from the garbage. Finally, government took over around 75 acres from the local residents. Though the government paid compensation to the land owners, they moved the court for additional compensation. Now, the corporation is paying instalments of Rs 5.5 crore each to pay the additional compensation of Rs 160 crore. The existing windrow compost plant, operating from a dilapidated building, is not functioning effectively. So, the authorities have decided to construct a waste-to-energy plant. As per the plan, it will require around 20 acres for constructing the waste-to-energy plant. The government has already allotted five acres to IMA to construct a biomedical waste treatment plant. Another five acres houses a sewage treatment plant. Barring these facilities, a vast area remains unused. If various plants are operated in a scientific and odour-free manner, the remaining land can be used for setting up other facilities. The corporation, for example, is on the lookout for three acres for constructing a modern slaughterhouse. The slaughterhouse at Kaloor, which lacks even the basic facilities, can be shifted to Brahmapuram. Then, the precious land at Kaloor can be used for more productive and beneficial projects. The remaining land can be used for income-generating projects. The scope for such projects is high as the 110 acres at Brahmapuram shares borders with SmartCity, Kochi, and the Infopark is just a stone’s throw away.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/corp-fails-to-use-110-acres-productively/articleshow/87766782.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

Along with the CM, ministers, MLAs, MLCs, MPs and other elected representatives across the state will also take part in the ‘Maha Dharna’ at Indira Park. Though the TRS had held a few protests and dharna earlier, including during Bharat Bandh, CM KCR, who is also the TRS president, had never participated in any protests personally. KCR, who on Tuesday had announced that the party would hold dharna against the attitude of the Centre on paddy procurement policy, also wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday on the issue. Minister T Harish Rao and Talasani Srinivas Yadav visited Indira Park on Wednesday and reviewed the arrangements. Harish Rao later told reporters that the dharna was being held to press the BJP government at the Centre to spell out its stand as the saffron party’s local and central leadership was creating confusion among farmers. “TRS always fight for the people whether in power or not. We also protested transferring seven mandals to Andhra after formation of Telangana in 2014. Now, our demand is that the Centre should adopt same policy for all states. Our dharna is not aimed at showing of strength, but to press for our demand,” the minister said. He alleged that the Centre was trying to evade its responsibility in purchasing rice from the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-to-sit-on-dharna-for-1st-time-after-becoming-cm/articleshow/87767668.cms||---

The vehicle has been registered in Maharashtra. The vehicle was seized from Irumbanam on Monday. A Kochi native, who brought the vehicle from Maharashtra, has been asked to pay Rs 25,000, tax of three months. The tax amount of the caravan is fixed based on the length of the vehicle. If the seized vehicle has to operate in the state for one year, tax of Rs 1 lakh will have to be remitted to the government. The vehicle has been currently parked at the workshop belonging to the department. It will be released when the tax amount is remitted. Recently, MVD officials seized three caravans, registered in other states, brought to Kerala as part of shooting at Munnar. It has also been noted that many vehicles which transport goods items operate in the state without paying road tax. “Delay in paying road tax or not paying tax is because of financial constraints caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. When we seize the vehicles, the owners pay tax,” said a MVD official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/caravan-seized-for-not-paying-road-tax/articleshow/87766792.cms||---

Hearing the writ petition filed by Congress corporators Varsha Jane and Trupti Lakhe on Wednesday, the bench headed by Justice M I Arun told the government to submit its statement on the issue by November 29. The petitioners claimed that MLCs Laxman Savadi, Tulasi Munirajugowda, Bharati Shetty, Pratap Simha Nayak, Leher Singh, Raghunath Malkapure and Dr Talwar Sabanna had filed online applications to include their names in the list in Kalaburagi city, on October 23. “They have violated the guidelines for voters' addition. They also made the council secretary to instruct the Kalaburagi DC to shift their nodal district to Kalaburagi,” they added. Former Congress corporator Huligeppa Kanakagiri alleged the BJP MLCs have created a rent agreement with their party workers to add their names to the voters’ list. “However, they have not deleted their names in the district, from where they were shifting to Kalaburagi. Legally, they may be right. But it shows that the BJP can go down to any extent to grab power. We will also file another petition against the regional commissioner who has postponed the mayoral polls, citing the reason of MLC elections,” said Kanakagiri. The Kalaburagi city corporation elections saw a fractured mandate, with neither of the three major political parties securing complete majority. The results were announced on September 6 along with two other corporations of Belagavi and Hubballi-Dharwad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/kalaburagi-corporation-row-hc-issues-notice-to-seven-mlcs/articleshow/87765559.cms||---

The GRMB through letters had asked the state government to share information about the projects to take over the projects as per the gazette notification issued by the Union ministry of water resources finalising the jurisdictions of both Krishna and Godavari boards in July this year. The jurisdiction came into effect on October 14. The board sought information like sanctioned posts, plants. machinery, equipment, office premises, furniture, vehicles, DPRs and records maintained since inception. The members raised the objections during the GRMB sub-committee meeting held on Wednesday. The officials protested against the preparation handing over note of Godavari Lift Irrigation Scheme (Devadula) intake pumphouse at Gangaram and Geesukonda cross regulator on Kakatiya Canal as GRMB team visited the sites without involving the sub-committee members. The officials said as there were no common projects, there was no necessity of deployment of Central Industrial Security Forces (CISF) which would be a burden on the state government. “As per clause 4 of Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal award, states can transfer part of their share to any basin. GLIS and Sriram Sagar project were sanctioned by AP. AP had no objection for transfer of water from Godavari basin to supply irrigation water to areas in Krishna basin. Now, post- bifurcation, AP is objecting to this transfer, which is not acceptable to Telangana and is against the GWDT award,” a senior official of Telangana said.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Devendra Fadnavis restless after losing power, shouldn’t stoop so low, says Sharad Pawar||NAGPUR: A day after opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis slammed the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition as the “most corrupt” in Maharashtra’s history, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar launched a counter attack on Fadnavis’s home turf saying he had become restless after losing power. In Nagpur for a three-day tour of Vidarbha, the MVA’s chief architect on Wednesday urged the former CM to accept the reality. “I can understand that BJP state president Chandrakant Patil is making such (inflammatory) statements (on Amravati riots), but I am surprised over Fadnavis making them. He shouldn’t stoop to this level.” The octogenarian, however, lauded Union minister Nitin Gadkari saying he helped everyone irrespective of background or party. Refusing to comment on the riots and Shiv Sena’s demand to ban an organisation allegedly involved in fomenting the trouble, the NCP chief said whatever happened in Tripura, its repercussions should not have been felt in Maharashtra. “It’s a very sensitive issue where some people are trying to give it a communal colour for their obvious political benefits. Whosoever is responsible for the riots must be brought to book. I had asked home minister Dilip Walse Patil to visit Amravati to take stock of the situation,” he said. Defending his close aide and former home minister Anil Deshmukh, Pawar said injustice was meted out to him as the complainant (former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh) has himself gone missing and had stated that he had no proof. “Now, Singh may be declared absconder as he is not responding to the cops, but Deshmukh is in jail.” Regarding MPCC president Nana Patole’s repeated jibes against NCP, the Maratha strongman said his party still followed Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru’s ideologies, even though they were not part of Congress. “We are working together in the MVA government and we are more or less similar to Congress. A person, who won Lok Sabha and assembly polls on the BJP ticket, would have this mentality.” Emphasizing on the need for a third front at the national level to fight the BJP in the 2024 general elections, the former Union agriculture minister said he would meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi and West Bengal CM Mamta Banerjee during the forthcoming winter session of parliament. “It’s not important who will lead the front, its formation is necessary. We will take people’s help.” On whether MVA constituents would jointly fight forthcoming civic polls in the state, the NCP chief said it was not yet decided as the elections were being held at the local level where every party wanted to field their own activists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-fadnavis-restless-after-losing-power-shouldnt-stoop-so-low/articleshow/87767715.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

After KCR addressed the media on Tuesday night and requested the Centre for clarity on procurement and remaining stock of paddy in the current season, the state party leadership and the national party had a frantic conversation over it. While the national party instructed them to wait three days, party leaders are expecting a more forceful response from any of senior cabinet member. “We hope that someone like Piyush Goyal responds strongly to the developments in the state,” a prominent leader stated. Following the CM’s address, top brass from Delhi enquired about the situation with state leaders. Union jal shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat responded to numerous queries posed by the CM over the water dispute with neighbouring Andhra Pradesh a few days ago. “Similarly, one of the ministers would respond to the current paddy situation,” a top source said. Union minister of tourism G Kishan Reddy had already responded to the TRS government claims about the paddy procurement. The BJP state unit informed the national party about chief minister KCR’s counter-allegations. “Over the following several days, many Union ministers are expected to respond to the CM’s claims; this is a right opportunity for us to attack the TRS government,” sources added. According to insiders, party chief Sanjay would also speak to national leadership in the coming days to seek a clarification on the procurement of remaining stock for this season. “Ever since the paddy issue became a hot topic, the party brass has taken a keen interest in the developments in the state and observed the TRS stand,” they claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-bjp-seeks-clarity-from-own-party-on-kcrs-paddy-claims/articleshow/87767708.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Waqf tribunal orders removal of Pir Mohammed Shah Dargah trustees||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat State Waqf Tribunal has ordered for removal of all 21 trustees of Pir Mohammed Shah Dargah Trust and appointment of a Class-1 Muslim officer as administrator, who will be tasked with managing the affairs of the trust having numerous properties and also to hold elections for new trustees and mutavallis (caretakers). Tribunal’s chairman A I Shaikh and member Rizwan Qadri were upset with the management of the trust and held the trustees and caretakers responsible for not putting in efforts to increase the rent income from as many as 320 properties spread over the commercial areas in the Walled City and in Kadi and Viramgam towns. The tribunal noticed that the present rent amounts range from Rs 50 to Rs 57,000, and if the rent is fixed according to the jantri rates, the trust’s income may increase significantly, and it can work for the welfare of the poor and needy. The tribunal also took notice of the fact that the trustees did not even bother to help the poor in the taxing Covid-19 times when the downtrodden required support from such charitable organisations. It said that the trust had Rs 2 crore in fund but did nothing to help people during the pandemic. Acting on an application seeking removal of the trustees including president Mohammed Shafi Maniar, the tribunal ordered the administrator on November 11 to initiate concrete actions to enhance rent of trust’s properties considering the provisions of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2013 and the Waqf Property Lease Rule, 2014. It has ordered the present trustees to hand over all documents related to trust’s accounts to the administrative officer. It has observed that despite an earlier order, the trustees did not undertake efforts to raise the rent income and if any losses were incurred to the trust due to mismanagement, the trust can recover the loss from their pockets. The tribunal was critical of the trustees’ inaction, who allegedly did not raise the rent amount fearing action from tenants. It said that such an excuse is shocking. It also said that meek persons are not fit to manage the trust who do not act on apprehension that it may bring infamy to the trust. The tribunal also said that despite earlier order not to repeat mutavallis and trustees for more than two terms, they have continued to be in the office for decades. The tribunal has no problem with long incumbency, but it is trustees’ responsibility to conserve the properties, raise rent income and to extend help to the poor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/waqf-tribunal-orders-removal-of-pir-mohammed-shah-dargah-trustees/articleshow/87766835.cms||---

While the average wholesale tomato prices have gone up marginally in a month, from Rs 24 per kg around a month back to Rs 35 a kg now. The retail prices of good quality tomatoes have doubled from Rs 40 a kg around a month back to Rs 80 a kg now. According to the agriculture market produce committee officials, tomato production has dropped due to prolonged unseasonal rains. The arrival of tomatoes declined from 34,000 quintals a day in October to around 14,600 quintals a day at present at that market. The tomatoes auctioned at the mandi are not only supplied to Nashik and parts of Maharashtra, but also to various states in the county. In August, the average wholesale tomato prices had crashed from Rs 20 a kg to Rs 2.5 a kg due to bumper arrivals of the crop. But the heavy rainfall in September damaged the tomato crop in the district to a large extent, resulting in a steady rise in tomato prices in October. On October 14, the average tomato price was Rs 24 a kg at Pimpalgaon APMC, while the prices had increased to Rs 40 a kg in retail markets of Nashik. In October, the daily supply was 34,000 quintals a day at Pimpalgaon. Deepak Gavli, who takes care of tomato auctions at Pimpalgaon APMC, said that the supply of tomatoes has drastically reduced due to damage to tomato crops due to heavy rain in September and October. “The average tomato prices had increased up to Rs 45 a kg on Tuesday, but reduced to Rs 35 a kg on Wednesday due to rise in supply in the local markets of UP and Bihar. The average wholesale tomato prices are expected to be the same for the next few days until the supply increases,” said Gavli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/unseasonal-rain-damages-crop-tomatoes-sell-at-rs-80/kg-in-retail/articleshow/87896138.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Dehradun||21 years on, talks between UP, Uttarakhand CMs still on over division of properties||DEHRADUN: Uttar Pradesh (UP) chief minister Yogi Adityanath and his Uttarakhand counterpart Pushkar Singh Dhami are scheduled to meet in Lucknow on Thursday to resolve the long-pending issues between the two states. In the meeting, which is also likely to be attended by bureaucrats of both states, the key agenda of asset distribution would be discussed. Sources said that the talks will mainly focus on properties in Haridwar, Udham Singh Nagar and Champawat districts. “Both sides aim to resolve the issue at the earliest. Some important decisions are likely,” a source told TOI while adding that the high-level meeting will commence at 11 am and is expected to go on for an hour. While Uttarakhand was carved out of Uttar Pradesh in November 2000, the neighbouring state continues to have ownership of several properties, including land and canals, which lie in the Himalayan state. However, there has been some progress on this front since 2017. Soon after assuming office, Uttar Pradesh (UP) chief minister Yogi Adityanath handed over the rights of 37 canals to the irrigation department of the Himalayan state. Later, the UP government also handed over the ownership of Alaknanda Hotel at Haridwar to Uttarakhand. The recent round of conversation is likely to benefit the irrigation department, power department and transport department of Uttarakhand. Several buildings — currently under the jurisdiction of Uttarakhand but controlled by UP’s irrigation department — are likely to be transferred to the Himalayan state after the meeting. Besides distribution of properties, several issues related to energy, transport, finance, awaas vikas, public works, animal husbandry, forest, rural development, education, social welfare, drinking water and sanitation departments are pending between the two neighbouring states. Further, the issue of UP allowing water sports at Upper Ganges Canal in Roorkee also remains pending.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/21-years-on-talks-between-up-ukhand-cms-still-on-over-division-of-properties/articleshow/87766001.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole urges CM Uddhav Thackeray to cut taxes on fuel||MUMBAI: State Congress president Nana Patole on Wednesday urged Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to forthwith reduce state taxes on petrol and diesel for providing relief to the common man, who is reeling under spiraling prices of petroleum products. “We must understand the plight of the common man. If Congress-ruled Punjab and Rajasthan can reduce the prices of petrol and diesel, then I think it should not be difficult for the chief minister to consider our proposal. I feel that the decision on reducing the prices of petroleum products should be taken on top priority,’’ Patole said. Patole alleged that ever since Narendra Modi took over the reins of the country seven years ago, the NDA government has been ‘looting’ people. The prices of petrol and diesel were marginally reduced only after the NDA suffered a debacle in the recent by-elections, but at the same time it continued to loot the people by imposing heavy cess on petroleum products. “From March 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021, the central government has usurped over Rs 30,000 crore from the state governments as revenue from excise duty. The NDA government is economically exploiting the poor people by increasing the cess on fuel,’’ the state Congress chief said. Patole said the NDA government is levying a central excise duty of Rs 27.9 on petrol and Rs 21.8 on diesel. As per rules, the state government is supposed to get Rs 11.16 on petrol and Rs 8.72 on diesel, while it is given only 56 paisa on petrol and 72 paisa on diesel. He demanded that petrol be priced at Rs 60 a litre in view of declining crude oil prices in the international market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-cong-chief-urges-cm-to-cut-taxes-on-fuel/articleshow/87767737.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Tipped off, the Satellite police arrested Ankit Parmar, a 24-year-old resident of Sanskar Tower on Science City Road, with 21 bottles of Indian Made Foreign Liquor. In his complaint, Ramesh Bhupat of the surveillance squad said that the team was on surveillance on Tuesday night when the cops received information that a grey car with Rajasthan registration plate was parked at Dev Arc Mall. The person was selling liquor from the car. The cops stated in the FIR that as they walked to the mall parking lot, they spotted the car and Parmar was in the driver’s seat. Cops checked the car and found two blue plastic bags on the rear seat. The bags contained 21 IMFL bottles. Parmar failed to produce the permit for it and was detained. He was later arrested and questioned about his source. An investigator said, “This is a new modus operandi where a person was selling alcohol illegally from the parking space in a mall. The person was sitting in his car and supplying it to his customers. “They pretended to be customers visiting shops in the mall and walked out with the liquor without undergoing any checks,” a cop said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-held-selling-imfl-in-sg-road-mall-parking-area/articleshow/87766859.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: AAP CM face Col Ajay Kothiyal (retd) to contest from Gangotri seat||DEHRADUN: On the second day of his Uttarakhand visit, Delhi's deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia announced that Colonel Ajay Kothiyal (retired), the party's chief ministerial face for the hill state, will contest the upcoming assembly polls from the Gangotri constituency in Uttarkashi district. The announcement assumes significance since there is brewing discontent against the BJP in Char Dham towns, particularly Gangotri and Kedarnath, with the teerth purohit (priest) community strongly opposing the Char Dham Devasthanam Board Act -- which brings 50 temples under government control. Political observers believe that this discontent may benefit AAP in Gangotri. Interestingly, the political history of the Gangotri seat has built up a belief that the party which wins this seat goes on to form the government in Uttarakhand. Meanwhile, Sisodia also participated in a roadshow and addressed a public gathering at Ramleela Ground in Uttarkashi. Addressing the gathering, Sisodia said, “Colonel Kothiyal has stepped into politics for the development of Uttarakhand and he will definitely live up to the expectations of the people.” The senior AAP leader also slammed Congress and BJP for the poor condition of the Himalayan state. “The successive Congress and BJP governments in Uttarakhand have not delivered on their promises. Despite being a power-generating state, Uttarakhand has to pay heavy electricity bills,” Delhi deputy CM. Meanwhile, Colonel Kothiyal called Uttarkashi his karmbhoomi and said, “Earlier, I fought for the safety of the country and now I am fighting for the betterment of people.” Notably, Kothiyal has served as the principal of the Nehru Institute of Mountaineering (NIM) in Uttarkashi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/aap-cm-face-col-ajay-kothiyal-retd-to-contest-from-gangotri-seat/articleshow/87766017.cms||Gaurav Talwar

Inaugurating the portals at an event held at Dehradun’s IRDT auditorium, CM Dhami appreciated the department of information technology while adding that all departments will be connected with the Apni Sarkar portal in the future. While the Apni Sarkar portal will provide state residents online access to 75 facilities of nine departments, the Unnati portal has been developed to help senior state officials keep an eye on the status of projects. “The portals would be used to dispose of the complaints in a time-bound manner. These facilities will help every citizen of the state,” he added. Ramesh Kumar Sudhanshu, principal secretary, information and science technology department, said that through the Apni Sarkar portal, people will be able to secure their character certificate, caste certificate, income certificate, birth and death certificate, employment registration, old age pension, widow pension and specially-abled pension while sitting at home. All certificates will be integrated and stored in Digital Locker, he added. Meanwhile, the project plans of all departments of the Uttarakhand government will be proposed through the Unnati portal, which has been developed to ensure inter-departmental coordination. The portal will help senior state officials -- including chief secretary, additional chief secretary and head of departments -- in monitoring pending departmental proposals, taking follow-up actions and tracking the progress of projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cm-dhami-launches-two-portals-to-encourage-e-governance/articleshow/87766026.cms||Kautilya Singh

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Pani-puri vendor gets 10-years rigorous imprisonment for sexual assault on 2-year-old girl||MUMBAI: Observing that there is no substance in the defence submission that removal of garments was essential to establish sexual intent, a special POCSO court convicted and sentenced a 31-year-old pani puri seller to 10 years rigorous imprisonment for sexually assaulting a 2-year-old girl in 2016. The conviction came in the absence of the child’s deposition in court. The court reasoned, “The child was of so tender age that she was incapable of understanding the nature of the act, and she was incapable of being examined in this court as a witness.” The accused used to sell pani puri in front of the child’s house. Among the dozen witnesses court also relied on the statements of the child’s aunt who found her crying with abrasions on her private parts and a neighbour who saw the accused taking the child and then returning with her bawling. A doctor said that sexual assault could not be ruled out. “All the star witnesses examined by the prosecution deposed naturally before this court, thereby inspiring the confidence of this court. Their testimonies could not be shattered on behalf of the accused. There was no reason at all for them to implicate the accused falsely,” the court said. The court said there is no substance in the defence submission that pointing a finger at a person does not reflect his culpability or that the name of the accused should have been stated by the child. “It is a matter of common prudence that a kid would continue to weep, if it is hurt by any person and would merely point its finger, instead of stating the name,” the court said. The court also observed that it is a matter of general child psychology that a child would point its finger at any person who hurts her. The accused was found guilty for the offence of aggravated penetrative sexual assault under the POCSO Act. While the court accepted that the crime was heinous, it said that it is also to be considered that no severe physical harm was caused by the accused. “The child was not carried to any unknown place or to any longer distance, to take more undue advantage. The minimum punishment provided for the offence of aggravated penetrative sexual assault would meet the ends of justice, considering the age of the accused and also, considering the above circumstances,” the court said. The child would stay with her aunt while her parents were away at work. It was alleged that on March 30, 2016, at around 4.45 pm, her aunt heard her crying. Until then, the child was playing in the verandah outside the house. The aunt found that the child was crying on the staircase outside the house and both her hands were on her private parts. It was submitted that when the aunt enquired with her, the child pointed her finger towards the accused. The aunt found fresh blood stains on the child’s undergarments and abrasions on her private parts. When the aunt enquired with the accused as to why he took the child upstairs as it was unusual, the accused tried to give her evasive answers. When the child’s parents returned home, the aunt told them about the incident. Subsequently, an FIR was lodged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pani-puri-vendor-gets-10-years-for-sexual-assault-on-2-yr-old/articleshow/87766876.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Vijayawada||Student enrollment in AP govt schools jumps||Visakhapatnam: Andhra Pradesh is one of the few states that have witnessed an increase in the student enrollment in government schools over the years as per the sixteenth ‘Annual Status of Education Report (Rural) 2021’ released on Wednesday. For children in the age group of 6-14, enrollment in the government schools has increased to 71% in 2021 from 62% in 2018 in AP. This shift is seen in all grades and among both boys and girls. The maximum increase in government school enrollment is seen in Uttar Pradesh and Kerala. Other than Telangana, all southern states have witnessed an 8% increase in student enrollment in government schools between 2018 and 2021. If parental education is taken as a factor, only 56% of the highly educated parents are sending their wards to government schools in Andhra Pradesh. This is almost 91% for the parents in the ‘low’ education category. As per the ASER, the school education report facilitated by non-profit Pratham, the availability of smartphones in households has almost doubled since 2018. About 72% of the total pupils in Andhra Pradesh currently have smartphones available at homes compared to a mere 42% in 2018. However, 18% of them do not have access to these smartphones for their studies. This means only some 60% of students have full-time or partial access to smartphones for studies. The study identified digital divide among the students with children from families having low education and no resources like smartphones had less access to learning opportunities. There is evidence of effort even in these households. Parents have been purchasing smartphones specifically for their children’s education. In 2020, about 4% children had taken private tuition classes in Andhra Pradesh. This proportion jumped to almost 23% in 2021. About 96% of the enrolled children have textbooks of their current grade. ASER 2021 was conducted in 25 states and 3 Union Territories during September and October, 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/student-enrollment-in-ap-govt-schools-jumps/articleshow/87766032.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

---||Surat||Gujarat: Four arrested for religious conversions in Bharuch||SURAT: Four of the nine persons accused for forcible religious conversion in villages of Bharuch district were arrested late on Tuesday night. A complaint against the nine persons was lodged after a man who was converted with the lure of a good job filed a complaint with Amod police station. Preliminary investigation had revealed that around 100 people from some 35 families were converted with inducement of money. Investigation of the case was handed over to deputy superintendent of police MP Bhojani. Police arrested Abdul Aziz Patel alias Ajit Chaganbhai Vasava, Yusuf Jivanbhai Patel alias Mahendra Jivanbhai Vasava, Ayub Barkatbhai Patel alias Raman Barkatbhai Vasava and Ibrahim Punabhai Patel alias Jitu Punabhai Vasava, all natives of Kankaria village of Bharuch. Their interrogation revealed that they received money from other accused persons which they used in luring other villagers for conversion. Children of converted families also started their study in nearby Darul Uloom. Families were also taken to mass prayer on Friday, police officials said. Two accused - Salauddin Sheikh and Umar Gautam - against whom Vadodara special operation group (SOG) had registered case on August 24 will also be questioned if needed to ascertain if they were involved in Bharuch religious conversion racket. Gautam and Shaikh are currently lodged in the Vadodara jail. Police sources said the racket was operated in a very organised way and the accused had pre-planned sending money and facilities required to lure people for conversion. Police is also investigating the route through which funds were sent from abroad. Many people who converted are yet not ready to give a police statement. Arrested persons are those who are directly connected with people and played the main role in luring villagers. Vadodara SOG had informed Bharuch counterparts after they had registered a case against Salauddin, a managing trustee of Aafmi Charitable Trust and Mohammad Umar Gautam on August 24. Abdullah Fefdawala, a native of Nabipur village in Bharuch and resident of London in the UK, had allegedly sent Rs 80 crore to Salauddin via FCRA and hawala. Sheikh used this money to finance conversion, building a mosque in the target area and help the accused nabbed during a demonstration against CAA and NRC in Delhi get bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/four-arrested-for-religious-conversions-in-bharuch/articleshow/87766211.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Net issues force rural schools to restart classes||PANAJI: Even as the government still debates whether schools should reopen for students from Classes I to VIII, managements of some rural schools — impatient with poor internet connectivity and lack of devices — sought special permission from the government, got their parent teacher associations’ (PTA) nods, and got going with offline sessions for younger students. For some schools, the return to physical classes began as early as September. In Canacona, the Shree Nirakar Education Society runs five schools, with a combined strength of 1,000 students. Soon after the Ganesh Chaturthi vacation ended, the management started conducting physical classes for students from Class V to VIII on alternate days. “We will be opening our schools in Mashem and Gaondongri right from the primary section from November 22,” said the society’s head, Prashant Naik. “We have been running classes from Class V to VIII, and we have not had any problems. The positivity rate is presently down in the state. CM should now say ‘bivpachi garaz na’ and open schools.” In Bicholim, the Vidyavardhak Mandal Educational Society had similarly started conducting physical classes for students of Classes VII and VIII on alternate days from October. Society chairman Vijay Sardesai said that they are now looking to reopen schools right from Class I from Monday. “Some of our students did not have mobile phones, and we provided them with phones through sponsors. How many can we provide with devices? We have 4,300-4,500 students studying in our four institutions from Classes I to XII. A majority of them come from interior areas, and do not have internet connectivity to attend online classes,” said Sardesai. He said that the school is presently seeing attendance of 95%. Insistence and support from parents was a driving force for the schools. Even in the case of Classes X to XII, the society was the first to start physical sessions with special permission, even before the state could give its nod to all schools. “The parents told us that their children are facing difficulties. So we held a meeting, and parents gave us the green signal to start classes. We started by following all SOPs. Parents are very happy with the way we are conducting classes. We have formed a team to monitor students for symptoms,” said Sardesai. The management even saw a visit from the state task force to check the functioning of physical classes in its schools. “In Class XII itself, we have 700 students, so we sat them in classrooms at 50% capacity. We have the infrastructure for it. We have already started sanitising the premises to start classes from the primary level,” Sardesai said. Many low-enrolment schools in rural areas like Sarvan, Karapur, Pilgao, Maulinguem, Kuchirem in Bicholim taluka have also started conducting physical classes, to assist students dealing with poor connectivity. “The last academic year 2019-20 was lost due to Covid, and students were lagging behind,” said Tukaram Sawant from Sarvan, Bicholim, the parent of two children studying in Classes VII and VIII. “So the school authorities called a meeting of parents and it was discussed that if the schools have low enrolment, there should be no issue of social distancing. The decision turned out to be successful. It tremendously benefited the students, after such a prolonged break from school.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/net-issues-force-rural-schools-to-restart-classes/articleshow/87767775.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

People have complained of "inefficient management, no prior notice as well as sub-standard work" during the pipe laying process. “Peyjal Nigam has dug up the road near our school without giving any notice. There is not even adequate space for residents and school students to walk on this narrow hill road while all vehicular traffic has been stalled. In case of an emergency in the school even the ambulance won't be able to reach the premises,” said Arackal Kurian, a teacher of Wynberg Allen School. Kurian added that proper notice must be given to residents before digging the roads while the work must be done in a manner so that sufficient space is there for pedestrians to walk. “While the entire town has been dug up, the repair of roads post digging is of extremely poor quality. The dug-up roads have deep potholes even after repair work, posing problems for pedestrians and motorists,” said Rajat Aggarwal, president of Mussoorie Traders' Association. When contacted, Vijay Chauhan, executive officer of Mussoorie Municipal Council (MMC), said that the work is being done by Peyjal Nigam and if the quality of road repair is poor he would issue notice to the concerned department. Speaking to TOI, Sujeet Kumar Vikash, executive engineer of Peyjal Nigam, assured that the potholes would be repaired and also adequate efforts would be made to timely notify the residents prior to digging up any road. “While this is an important project for the town, it is also desirable that the public should not face inconvenience due to this project and proper repair of roads is ensured after laying the pipelines,” urged Geeta Kumai, ward member of MMC. Mussoorie faces acute water scarcity during the summer months as the peak season water demand is around 14.5 million litres per day (MLD) while the availability of water is only around 7.67 MLD. Under this project, water from Yamuna river would be pumped up to Mussoorie to meet the drinking water requirements. The project has an outlay of Rs 124 crore and has a capacity to pump up to 12 million litres of water per day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/peyjal-nigam-residents-face-hardships-due-to-dug-up-roads-sub-standard-work/articleshow/87766052.cms||Anmol Jain

The realtor Paresh Akbari, his friend Vimal Bambhva and the three killers Mehul Pargi, Rajesh Parmar and Kishan Jethwa were arrested on Wednesday. The victim Manoj Vadher, who was unemployed, was killed as he used to get drunk and beat his wife Falguni. Falguni had asked Akbari, with whom she had extra-marital affair, to free her from her husband’s torture. Interestingly, it was the initial investigation done by Falguni and Vadher’s family members that led the cops to the killers. Vadher was found dead on the morning of October 28 near railway tracks with head injuries. Police had registered a case of accidental death and suspected that he may have been knocked down by a running train. Falguni and the victims’ family members, however, used to visit the spot where the body was found and speak to people living near the railway tracks. On November 4, she gave a complaint to police to lodge a murder case after a person told her that he had seen two men arguing over alcohol around 9pm on October 27 and later one of them hit the other on head with a stone. While investigating Falguni’s version of events, the crime branch received information that Parmar was with Vadher on the night the latter died. Parmar was picked up for questioning. Later, Parmar confessed that he and two others had taken a contract to kill Vadher. His two accomplices Pargi and Jethwa were also arrested and their statements led police to Akbari and Bambhva. Akbari told police that he had planned the murder to free Falguni from the torture of her husband. However, Falguni has maintained that she had no idea that her paramour had planned the murder. Police are questioning Falguni to know whether she had any involvement in the crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/unemployed-mans-death-on-tracks-turns-out-to-be-a-murder/articleshow/87766158.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The case has been handed over to the detection of crime branch (DCB) that is now trying to track down the parents who pushed their children into the drug trade. “Mohnisa Munshi and her brother Shaqib Munshi, who are well-educated, used to hang out near the educational institutes and colleges in the city. They used to gel with the youngsters and get them addicted to drugs. It was easy for them to find customers at such places,” said a crime branch official. They also used to target youngsters working at big firms in commercial complexes as well as those visiting beauty parlours. During their questioning, the brother-sister duo revealed that about 25 to 30 youngsters used to buy drugs from them regularly. Apart from Mohnisa and Shaqib, their friends Meet Thakkar and Nupur Sehgal, who works for a multinational company (MNC), too were arrested by the cops. All the four were remanded to police custody for one day on Wednesday. The cops are yet to arrest Abdullah Patel and his wife Zarina, parents of Mohsina and Shaqib. The police said that Mohsina had come in contact with Dilip, a resident of Anand, when she was studying there. Dilip told her about his drug trade following which Mohsina discussed it with Zarina. The entire family then decided to get into the drug trade for earning some quick money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/over-30-youngsters-were-their-regular-customers/articleshow/87766305.cms||---

And there is a possibility that a person or a group is behind this snooping of officials of the tax department, which is now trying to approach the company to seek its help to gather clues about the culprits behind it. Meanwhile, police have already started a probe in this case and a hunt is on to identify the person who bought the SIM cards recovered in the GPS devices. Additional deputy commissioner of police (investigation) Jagatpreet Singh said, “We have received a complaint from the office of mobile wing of the state taxation department, Ludhiana. They have handed over a SIM which was in the GPS device, and they have also shared important details about this case based upon which we are trying to zero in on the accused.” Sources said the state tax department officials are now trying to contact the company to know who bought these GPS devices and from which channel (e-commerce website or company dealer), date of activation and from which mobile number and IP address these were being monitored. Source said the senior officers of the state tax department have ruled out the role of an insider and the hand of some passers (members of organised gang comprising transporters and other persons involved in facilitating illegal movement of goods without paying tax) or transporters was being suspected. The case has left everyone, especially officials of other state and Central departments connected with investigative work, shocked. Some of the departmental heads have asked their officials and staff to remain vigilant and keep checking their vehicles for any such snooping device.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/snooping-case-all-gps-devices-in-taxmens-vehicles-of-same-firm/articleshow/87766049.cms||Mohit Behl

---||Goa||Property prices in Goa set to rise by 10-15%, says Credai||PANAJI: Alarmed by the sustained increase in prices of construction raw materials, including cement and steel, the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (Credai) on Wednesday urged the government to rein in the escalating prices. Credai-Goa said failure to tackle the skyrocketing prices will push the state’s real estate prices by at least 10-15% in the near term. Developers said that while construction costs increase, there is no provision in the Real Estate Regulatory Act and norms to revise and increase the cost of an apartment or home once the initial agreement has been signed. “We have been consistently witnessing sharp increase in the raw material prices over the past year and they don’t seem to be decreasing or stabilising in the near future,” said Credai-Goa president Nilesh Salkar. “The developers may not be able to absorb escalating costs and, unfortunately, will have to pass the burden to homebuyers,” Sale of residential properties saw a rebound during the festive period, but developers have also seen prices of almost all materials and commodities shoot up consistently since last January. “Add to this the delays in construction caused by lockdowns, curfews, and shortage of labour causing increased labour costs, led to a direct increase in construction cost anywhere between 10-15% in the past 18 months,” said Salkar. Credai has suggested that the Centre should permit escalation of prices by allowing a clause in the buyer-seller agreement. “The government may also consider either allowing input tax credit for real estate projects and rationalisation of GST on various construction raw materials from their current rates as this would bring down the prices of residential properties,” Salkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/property-prices-in-goa-set-to-rise-by-10-15-says-credai/articleshow/87767786.cms||Newton Sequeira

Of the 11 days, the AQI was poor on 10 days, with possible health impacts as “breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure”. On one day (November 9), the AQI was 306, which comes under very poor category, with possible health impacts as “respiratory illness on prolonged exposure”.This is for the first time after 2018 that the city’s air has remained poor for these many days in a row. In October 2017, the AQI was more than 200 for 16 days in a row. In the same year in November, AQI was above 200 for 14 consecutive days. In May 2018, the index was more than 200 on eight consecutive days, but had not crossed the mark in October and November.According to the CPCB data, in October and November 2019, the AQI was more than 200 on nine consecutive days and was poor to very poor on six consecutive days, respectively.In October and November 2020, the AQI crossed 200 mark on three and five consecutive days, respectively.Ludhiana witnessed 12 days of poor to very poor air quality in first half of November this year as well as in the corresponding period last year. In November 2019, such number of days was 11.Member secretary of PPCB Krunesh Garg said, “Drop in temperature and lower wind speed have affected the dispersal of pollutants, which is why the AQI is poor. As farm fires are going down, the AQI is expected to improve. Rains and winds can take away air pollutants, improving AQI.”A resident said, “First, because of bursting of crackers and then due to stubble burning the air quality has suffered. The authorities should act sternly to check pollution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/for-1st-time-in-4-yrs-poor-aqi-for-10-consecutive-days-in-a-month/articleshow/87766067.cms||Shariq Majeed

Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana on Tuesday held a crime review meeting with officers to discuss law and order arrangements and other aspects of policing at police headquarters. “The commissioner reiterated the need for optimal utilisation of manpower resources at police station level,” an officer said. While reviewing the merger and integration of PCR with police stations and separation of law and order and investigation duties at the police station level, CP Delhi said efforts put in by all officers have led to over 400 per cent reduction in response time towards distress calls on the 112 helpline. “Weekly offs should be provided to SHOs and other inspectors posted in police stations. For the first time, all police stations of Delhi have been provided with three inspector rank officers (SHO, inspector law and order and inspector investigation) for better supervision,” the commissioner said in the meeting. Senior officers were directed to ensure rigorous tenant verification so that no unverified person takes a house on rent. “There is an urgent need for more thorough impact assessment of crime prevention strategies to make systematic improvements for effective policing,” the police chief said. District DCPs were directed to review all pending crimes-against-women cases and ensure that chargesheets in these cases are filed within the mandated period. According to the police chief, while investigating cases of use of firearms in crime, the teams should also concentrate on getting to the source of ammunition to break the chain of the illicit arms trade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/response-time-to-distress-calls-down-by-400-cops/articleshow/87767808.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: ATS arrests 3, seizes 24kg more heroin in Jamnagar||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat anti-terrorism squad (ATS) which is investigating the seizure of 120kg of heroin in Morbi, on Tuesday arrested two persons from Sirohi in Rajasthan and one from Jamnagar. ATS sleuths also seized 24kg more of heroin, worth Rs 120 crore, from Navadra village in Jam-Kalyanpur taluka of Devbhoomi-Dwarka district, its officers said on Wednesday. The development came after ATS had on Sunday arrested three persons — Mukhtar Hussein alias Jabbar Jodiya, a resident of Jodia in Jamnagar, Ghulam Bhagad from Salaya in Devbhoomi-Dwarka, and Shamsuddin Husseinmiya Saiyyed alias Pirzada Bapu, a resident of Jinjuda village in Morbi — for possession of 120kg of heroin, worth Rs 600 crore. Hussein and Bhagad, at the instruction of Hussein’s brother Isa Rav, brought the drugs from a Pakistani drug racketeer, Zahid Bashir Baloch. During the investigation, it was revealed that the accused were active in states such as Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Punjab. Of the consignment of 132kg brought from Pakistan, 12kg was to be given to the aides of jailed sharpshooter Bharatbhusan Sharma alias Bhola Shooter — Ankit Jakhad and Arvind Yadav. The 12kg was to be delivered to the two by a Jamnagar resident, Iqbal Qadri. When Qadri went to deliver the drugs, a team of Gujarat ATS caught him, and Yadav, a resident of Sriganganagar in Rajasthan, from Sirohi district in Rajasthan, said an official statement of the ATS. During questioning, Yadav told cops that Sharma had been running the racket from Faridkot jail where he has been imprisoned in connection with cases of murder, attempted murder and extortion. Sharma’s aide, Jakhad, has been managing the illicit business at his behest, said an ATS officer, adding that both Sharma and Jakhad were close aides of another gangster, Lawrence Bishnoi. The ATS officer also said that they have also detained a wanted accused, Isa Rav’s son, Hussein Rav, in the case. On questioning Mukhtar Hussein, he told cops that one consignment, 24kg, was kept at the house of Anwar Patelia at Navadra village in Jam-Kalyanpur taluka of Devbhoomi-Dwarka district. An ATS team rushed there and seized the consignment, worth Rs 120 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ats-arrests-three-seizes-24kg-more-heroin-in-jamnagar/articleshow/87766890.cms||---

---||Goa||Make Goa fully cashless in 3-4 months: Minister Bhagwat Karad to bankers||PANAJI: Five years after former Union defence minister Manohar Parrikar called for Goa to be made the first cashless state in India, minister of state for finance Bhagwat Karad on Wednesday made a similar call, and gave bankers 3-4 months to completely eliminate cash, catching them by surprise. Karad, who chaired a special state-level bankers' committee (SLBC) meeting in Panaji, said that Goa’s robust banking network, high per capita income and high literacy could make the transition to a cashless economy faster. “Goa’s banking position is very good, now we must move ahead and declare Goa as a digital transaction state,” said Karad. “Cash transactions are primarily on petrol and diesel, these people at the pumps have to be trained first. Cash transactions are highest at the fuel pumps, then secondly at the kirana stores (and) vegetable vendors.” Citing his own experience of purchasing groundnuts from a street vendor in Delhi using a mobile payment app, Karad said that people should be able to pay for tea and daily groceries using a digital medium. State Bank of India general manager Sukhvinder Kaur informed Karad that 30% of all payments in Goa are done in cash. “From 30%, we must reduce it to 0%,” shot back Karad. “We have to make digital payments 100%. If we can make the two districts of Goa 100% digital transaction..., we can say that no cash is used in any village,” said Karad. India’s working poor rely almost exclusively on cash, and a majority of the country’s informal sector functions on off-the-books payments. According to data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) earlier this month, there has been a 64% increase in cash in circulation since demonetisation. Currency in circulation increased from Rs 17.7 lakh crore on November 4, 2016, to Rs 29.1 lakh crore on October 29 this year. Bankers also informed Karad that online financial frauds are a “by-product” of the push towards online banking, and that those not digitally savvy could fall prey to fraudulent transactions during the transition towards a cashless system. The doctor-turned-politician also met with chief minister Pramod Sawant, who agreed with the move to make Goa a 100% digital transaction state. Karad and Sawant also said that the state would work to ensure that every resident of the state is covered by the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana. Private and public sector bankers pointed out that poor cellular network penetration hinders digital payments in Goa’s hinterland. “I am from the Centre and here Puneet Kumar Goel (state finance secretary) is from the state government. Erect as many mobile towers as required,” said Karad. “The government must work to ensure that the internet reaches every part of the state.” Karad brought up the issues of internet penetration, digital banking, adoption of Central schemes and credit growth during an interaction with Sawant later in the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/make-goa-fully-cashless-in-3-4-months-jr-fin-min-to-bankers/articleshow/87767823.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand to come up with its own ‘Himalayan’ brand of spices and vegetables||DEHRADUN: While inaugurating the three-day International Spices and Vegetable fest in Rishikesh on Tuesday, agriculture minister Subodh Uniyal announced that Uttarakhand will be branding its own spices and vegetables. “We are pioneers in the cultivation of ginger, red chili, turmeric, cardamom, and garlic. Similarly, we are producing a huge amount of vegetables every year, which are sent out to other countries and states without our brand. We have therefore decided to use the ‘Himalayan’ prefix next to every product of ours. This will give an identity to our products and can also fetch us good prices at international markets,” Uniyal said. Notably, Uttarakhand is among the frontrunners in producing spices, with 6.62 metric tonnes of spices being produced across one hectare of land. Overall, the state produces 96,282 metric tonnes of spices across 14,536 hectares, according to the agriculture department’s 2019-2020 data. The hill state is among the leading producers of seven spices -- turmeric, garlic, chilly, coriander, fenugreek, ginger and black cardamom. HS Baweja, director, Uttarakhand horticulture department, said, “We will have a centre of excellence in Tehri for ginger, another one in Pithoragarh for turmeric, and one for chillies in Salt (Almora). In terms of productivity in spices, Uttarakhand is at the top position in the country. Now, we will help farmers sell their products in a way that gets them more profits.” The fest is being attended by stakeholders from several countries -- like Russia, Australia, America, Singapore and others. While some will attend the event virtually, others have come to Rishikesh for the fest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-to-come-up-with-its-own-himalayan-brand-of-spices-and-vegetables/articleshow/87766106.cms||Shivani Azad

The civic body has warned of punitive action against the dairy farms that violate the norm. Waste from these dairies flows into drains that end up polluting Ganga, according to civic officials. Meanwhile, the municipal corporation also levied penalties on nine dairy farms under the Cow Protection Act for keeping cattle in life-threatening conditions. Several of these establishments were issued a notice regarding poor sanitation earlier as well. At present, more than 50 dairy farms are operational in the jurisdictional limits of Haridwar Municipal Corporation. Dayanand Saraswati, Haridwar municipal commissioner, told TOI, “No dairy activities will be permitted without registration. During inspections on Wednesday, we found that several dairy businesses being run in the Jawalapur region do not keep cattle in hygienic conditions. Therefore, we imposed a penalty on nine dairies in the area and ordered officials to file a case against three dairy owners.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/no-dairy-activities-to-be-permitted-without-registration-of-animals-in-haridwar/articleshow/87766095.cms||MS Nawaz

The price slid by Rs 500 against Tuesday’s Rs 51,100 per 10 gram. According to analysts, gold prices showed a downward trend in the international market and hovered around the $1,860 per ounce mark according to the World Gold Council, after the dollar inched to a 16-month high. The gold price, however, is expected to increase in the days to come over concerns of rising global inflation, suggest industry players. “Gold is usually perceived as a hedge against inflation and amid concerns of global inflation coupled with a consistent depreciation of the Indian rupee against the US dollar, the yellow metal price in the Indian market is expected to go up,” said a city-based bullion trader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gold-price-falls-after-a-weeks-rally/articleshow/87766904.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Prince in a jam amid selfie-hunting horde||Ahmedabad: A viral photo shows a sub-adult lion trapped within a circle of jeeps loaded with people indiscriminatingly shooting photos. Experts have surmised that the picture is not recent as one of the guides spotted in it retired some time ago. However, wildlife activists are furious. They say the forest department claims it has installed GPS trackers in every jeep and has deputed a guide for each vehicle to ensure that the tourist rush doesn’t overwhelm the lions. The activists say if such measures are really in place, the sub-adult lion would not have been swamped by the selfie-crazed horde. Jaidev Dhadhal, a wildlife activist, has tweeted the picture and has written to the principal chief conservator of forests Shyamal Tikadar. Dhadhal wants action against the officers, drivers, and guides responsible for the situation in which the jungle royalty was cornered. Dhadhal stated in his email that it was the responsibility of the officials to ensure that the jeeps move on their allotted routes and avoid detours at all costs. But in this case it appears that many vehicles were on the same route. Bhushan Pandya, another activist, said: “Sukhabhai Dave is seen in the picture. He retired a few months ago.” However, Pandya said, initially only 90 vehicles per day were allowed on eight routes. Now, the vehicle numbers can reach up to 180 per day sometimes. “It seems that the arrangements have not been implemented properly,” said a senior forest department officer in Gandhinagar. “Even if the photograph is old, the fact remains that many vehicles were allowed to be bunched together.” This is sheer negligence on part of the beat guards and those monitoring the movement of vehicles, the officer said. He said the drivers may have also exposed tourists to some danger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/prince-in-a-jam-amid-selfie-hunting-horde/articleshow/87766900.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Covid distress forced Uttar Pradesh parents to shift kids from private to government schools: ASER||LUCKNOW: There has been a clear shift from private schools to government schools in the last three years, with Uttar Pradesh and Kerala reporting a maximum increase in government school enrolment, as per the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), 2021. Preference for government schools, researchers say, stemmed from the financial distress triggered by Covid-19 pandemic. In UP, enrolments in government schools rose by 13.2% percentage points in 2021 as compared to 2018, which was highest in the country, closely followed by Kerala that clocked an increase by 11.9 percentage points. Also, learning material availability to students rose apparently because schools remained shut and kids studied at home through online material. These assessments were released on Wednesday by ASER Centre — a non-profit organization that reports children's school and learning status from time to time. Director, ASER Centre, Wilima Wadhwa released the report online. The survey was conducted in over 76,706 households of 581 districts in 28 states of the country to know the impact of the pandemic and school closures on children’s access to learning opportunities. Around 8,808 households were surveyed in 70 districts of UP. While ASER-2020 was conducted in September 2020, six months into the pandemic, when schools were shut across the country, ASER 2021 was done in September-October, 2021, when schools were beginning to reopen, Wadhwa said. In UP, the study showed that in 2018, the total of 43.1% students (6-14 agegroup) were enrolled in government schools. The number rose to 49.7% in 2020 and 56.3% in 2021. This means, in two years of the Covid-19 pandemic, there was an increase of 13.2 percentage points in enrolment in government schools. "Parents shifted kids to government schools because of financial distress due to the pandemic as many affordable private schools had to be shut down. Besides, migrants moving back to their native places opted for government schools," said Wadhwa. At the same time, the survey found there was an increase in learning material available with students. In 2018, about 79.6% students of private and government schools in UP had textbooks of their respective grades. The number rose to 91.3% this year. More children taking private tuition:The survey also found a steady increase in children taking private tuition as parents wanted supplemental learning support for their wards during the pandemic. UP witnessed a rise of 19.1 percentage points in the number of students joining private tuitions or coaching in comparison to 2018. About 19.6% students were taking tuitions in 2018, which rose to 32.9% in 2020 and 38.7% in 2021. Arunachal Pradesh recorded the highest, 19.6 percentage points increase in students joining tuition/coaching in this period. 34.3% UP kids have no smartphone:The report also revealed that smartphone ownership in houses increased over time, but children's access was still an issue. As many as 34.3% UP students could not access smartphones for learning purpose, despite devices being available at their home due to various reasons. The state is in fourth place after Bihar, West Bengal and Jharkhand where 53.8%, 46.5% and 39.7% of students respectively are unable to use smartphones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/in-up-pandemic-distress-forced-parents-to-move-kids-from-private-to-govt-schools-aser-study/articleshow/87767837.cms||Mohita Tewari
---||Delhi||Dual blow: Sukesh Chandrasekhar’s target was duped by conman’s aides too||NEW DELHI: Not only conman Sukesh Chandrasekhar, but his partners also targeted his victim independently. It was a double whammy for Aditi Singh, the wife of former Ranbaxy promoter Shivinder Singh, sources said while elaborating on how Chandrasekhar’s aides duped her of Rs 7.2 crore on the pretext of transferring Rs 31.5 crore to Dubai. The accused allegedly transferred Rs 24 crore and pocketed the rest as they assumed that she would not approach police for help, the sources added. The chargesheet filed by Delhi Police’s Economic Offences Wing (EOW) in the Rs 200-crore extortion case reveals that Komal Poddar, branch head of RBL Bank at Baba Khadak Singh Marg, was allegedly tasked by Chandrasekhar to receive the money from Singh. Poddar used a web of 18 shell companies, nine of which had Delhi addresses. A probe has revealed that Poddar and two money exchangers — all three have been arrested — routed Rs 24 crore through a hawala agent, Jai Prakash alias Jaggi. Of this siphoned amount, Enforcement Directorate has recovered Rs 82 lakh in cash and gold worth Rs 95 lakh from Poddar’s house. The chargesheet also details the role of a Karol Bagh-based hawala dealer, Avtar Singh alias Dolly Kochar, who allegedly laundered Rs 120-130 crore between June 2020 and July 2021. Avtar was a contact of the Ramnani brothers who were reportedly handling the cash flow between the victim and Chandrasekhar. Avtar was funnelling the money to different cities in India and abroad for a 7% commission and is estimated to have earned Rs 8-10 crore, the chargesheet says. Delhi Police busted the racket in the first week of August and its Special Cell arrested Deepak Ramnani and his brother Pradeep, which led to a raid at Rohini jail and the arrest of Chandrasekhar. The case was then transferred to EOW. Subsequently, Chandrasekhar’s wife, Leena Maria Paul, seven jail officials and Avtar were also arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dual-blow-sukeshs-target-was-duped-by-conmans-aides-too/articleshow/87767843.cms||Raj Shekhar

Taking cognisance of the situation, higher education minister Dhan Singh Rawat has ordered officials to increase the number of seats in the colleges and make sure that no deserving student is left out. The minister asked the department to look into the possibility of holding evening classes to accommodate all students. Notably, exams were cancelled due to the pandemic and students were graded on internal assessment, resulting in more students scoring higher than usual. The pass percentage for Class XII (Uttarakhand Board of School Education) was 99.56% this year as against 80.26% last year.  Meanwhile, the department officials have also been asked to fill the vacant posts in the colleges and hold the convocation ceremonies of all state government-run universities by the end of the year. The department is also planning to provide DigiLocker services -- a cloud-based facility to store documents online -- to all college students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/with-students-having-scored-higher-than-usual-in-last-boards-ukhand-govt-degree-colleges-in-a-fix-over-offering-admissions/articleshow/87766121.cms||Mohammad Anab

---||Kolkata||Stop fighting over jurisdiction: West Bengal CM to cops||MADHYAMGRAM: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday asked Kolkata Police and Bidhannagar Police to stop fighting over jurisdiction and see that people don’t suffer. She said this in Madhyamgram while speaking about the spate of accidents at Chingrighata crossing on EM Bypass. “I have instances of some accidents that shouldn’t have happened. Kolkata Police keeps saying that the Chingrighata crossing does not fall under its jurisdiction. Bidhannagar Police, too, says the same. The bottom line is that people are suffering. We will be setting up a foot over bridge there but the problem has to be sorted out. I have been saying this since Gyanwant (Gyanwant Singh IPS) was the police commissioner,” the CM said at an administrative meeting in Madhyamgram. Banerjee also asked whether IPS officers, before handing over charge to their successors, were passing on “notes” to them so that the new officers can understand the problems and administrative plans in the area. Soon after the CM’s meeting, acting DGP Manoj Malviya visited Chingrighata crossing along with Bidhannagar Police commissioner Supratim Sarkar and Kolkata Police's joint CP (Traffic) Santosh Pandey. “It was decided that the deployment of cops would be increased. While Kolkata Police will increase the number of cops from 12 to 15 during peak hours, Bidhannagar Police will also double the number of cops on the Nicco Park stretch,” sources said. The entire stretch between Metropolitan and Hyatt has witnessed seven fatal accidents so far since 2019. The Bidhannagar stretch (up to Nicco Park) has witnessed three deaths in the same period. The CM also touched upon the issue of waterlogging in several pockets of Rajarjhat, Salt Lake and Dum Dum. The CM advised local MLAs and Bidhannagar mayor Krishna Chakraborty to take up the matter with the Airports Authority of India (AAI). “Water from the airport runway is flowing into the canals during heavy rain.

As per data on CoWin portal, 4.04 crore people in the state have taken both doses, constituting over 26% of the total eligible population of 15.04 crore. UP now has maximum number of fully vaccinated people in the country. Also, every tenth person to be immunised against coronavirus in the country is from Uttar Pradesh. The total number of fully vaccinated people in the country is over 38 crore. Data from CoWin portal also shows that Maharashtra, despite being closest to UP in terms of vaccination, is behind UP by over 50 lakh in the count of fully vaccinated. Officials said UP is already number one in terms of total doses administered and partially vaccinated population. According to officials, the credit for steady rise in vaccination in UP goes to the hard work put in by field workers, effective strategy to cover every eligible person, mitigate myths, eliminate digital divide and powerful communication and reinforcement strategy. The government has also rolled out ‘Har Ghar Dastak Abhiyan’ in which those due for vaccine dose are being contacted individually. Health officials urged people to adhere to Covid-19 prevention protocol despite vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/every-10th-fully-vaccinatedperson-in-country-is-from-up/articleshow/87767840.cms||Shailvee Sharda

A delegation of Congress leaders, MLAs and workers met state DGP Ashish Bhatia and submitted a memorandum,which stated that installing a bust of the man who murdered Gandhi was an attempt to attack the country’s integrity and was like an act of terrorism. “In the interest of the country’s integrity, request you to take action against the people behind this under sedition law,” the memorandum read. A group of people from a right-wing outfit, Hindu Sena, had on Monday installed the bust, which some Congress members demolished on Tuesday. Police arrested seven persons from both sides on charges of promoting enmity. “It is a matter of shame that such a thing is happening in the Gujarat of Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel. Gandhi is celebrated for non-violence, and dedicated his entire life to fight for the country’s freedom,” Congress leader Bharatsinh Solanki told reporters after meeting the DGP. “People who are behind this despicable act of installing the bust of the murderer of Mahatma Gandhi should be booked under sedition law, because this is an anti-national act. This is what we have demanded from the DGP,” he said. Godse’s bust was installed by members of the Hindu Sena, a right-wing outfit led by Jamnagar-based lawyer Pratik Bhatt, in an open ground of a small temple-cum-ashram on Jamnagar city outskirts, said inspector of Jamnagar ‘A’ division police station, Mahavir Jalu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cong-wants-sedition-charges-for-godse-bust-installation/articleshow/87766917.cms||---

Officials have claimed that this move will help check suspicious activities as a lot of public dealings take place in the Zone A office. The MC has also decided to convert an abandoned area near the office into a green park, where benches could be installed for the benefit of the general public. The main building is also being revamped, with beautiful graffiti being painted on the walls.Officials say that the cameras will help keep an eye on the public movement as in the past, several complaints were received about touts asking for money from visitors. The control of cameras will remain in the office of zonal commissioner.An old fountain inside the complex will also be removed as it has became a breeding ground for mosquitoes, officials said. Meanwhile, Jasjit Singh, a visitor to zone A office, said, “The CCTVs are must these days as at least senior officials can check what the junior staff is doing. However, the rush at the Suvidha center and other issues must be resolved too.” He said that there is a need reform the MC office so that the public does not face any harassment. Zonal Commissioner JS Sekhon said, “The CCTVs are must, especially where there is public dealing. I can check from my office if any resident is troubled in the Suvidha centre or anywhere else in the building. The entire office is under renovation.” He said the MC is responsible for cleanliness in the city, but if its own office is dirty, then it sends out a wrong message.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/cctvs-installed-at-mc-office-to-keep-an-eye-on-touts/articleshow/87766133.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The notices have come as a shocker to the striking MSRTC workers who, however, said they will not give up their protest. Union sources indicated that the protest will continue at least till November 22, when the matter comes up for hearing in Bombay high court. In an incident near Pune, a fight between a conductor operating an MSRTC bus and a bus controller who was on strike turned ugly, with the latter getting injured in the eye and admitted to hospital on Wednesday. Sources said the conductor, attached to Satara bus depot, was in a Shivshahi bus to Pune when some workers on strike objected. The sources said that a bus controller, who was also on strike, argued with the conductor, which led to the fight and he got injured. A BJP delegation led by MLA Gopichand Padalkar met governor B S Koshyari seeking his intervention in the issue. Padalkar said, “As head of state we requested the governor to issue orders to the state government to take steps to end the impasse. The state government is not interested in talking to striking employees, they are only taking coercive action, threatening employees.” He claimed that so far 36 employees have died by suicide. “A case of culpable homicide should be registered against transport minister Anil Parab for deaths of ST employees,” said leader of the Opposition in the legislative council, Pravin Darekar who visited Azad Maidan on Wednesday. On Wednesday, despite the strike, the number of buses operated by MSRTC (during strike period) for the first time crossed the 100-mark. The bus corporation operated 103 buses on 21 routes and ferried 2,756 passengers, officials said. Of this, nearly 400 passengers were those availing of ST buses from Mumbai. Till Wednesday, 7,400 employees returned to work with an assurance from the transport minister and MSRTC chairman Anil Parab that they will get police protection; 84,866 workers continued the strike and union sources said the protest could continue at least till Monday, when the hearing will come up in Bombay high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-msrtc-to-terminate-more-than-2k-staff/articleshow/87768570.cms||Somit Sen

On October 30, the former Ayodhya SSP Ashish Tiwari, constable Anil Rawat and the banker’s former fiancé, Vivek Gupta, were booked for abetment to suicide. Now, the probe angle has turned on its head with police zeroing in on a Faizabad businessman, who had called or engineered calls to the woman banker impersonating as the IPS officer. The deceased banker’s scooter too was found parked in his business premises and police sources confirmed he drove her to her apartment on the night she committed suicide. Sources said, the deceased banker had good relations with businessman and his family and was a frequent visitor to their home. He could now be charged as the main accused, police sources said. Call detail records of Constable Anil Rawat were also found to be clean and the banker’s former fiancé, Vivek Gupta, also had not called her in a year. Gupta was scheduled to marry the banker, but the engagement was cancelled in April last year after she raised questions on his character. Shraddha Gupta, who was deputy branch manager of PNB’s Sahabganj branch in Faizabad, was found hanging from a noose in her rented apartment opposite the bank's branch. She hailed from Rajajipuram locality of Lucknow and her father, Rajkumar Gupta, had lodged an FIR at Faizabad Kotwali police station after she was found dead.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pnb-woman-bankers-suicide-cops-zero-in-on-bizman-who-impersonated-as-ips-officer-to-make-calls/articleshow/87767845.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

---||Ludhiana||Ingot prices down, no change in scrap rates has bizmen in a fix||Ludhiana: The rate of steel, especially ingot, has taken a dive in the past few days, but the businessmen say it has increased their problems. According to the businessmen, the rates of ingot have dipped by Rs 6,000 per tonne and that of pig iron by Rs 2,000 per tonne, but the rates of scrap, which is an essential raw material for ingot and in finished products like sewing machine and cycle parts, have not gone down. In another problem for them, the customers, whose orders were under process, have started asking for discounts, citing decrease in rates of raw material.Jagbir Singh Sokhi, president of Sewing Machine Technology Park Cluster, said, “During the past about four days, the rate of ingot crashed from Rs 49,000 to Rs 43,000 per tonne, but rate of scrap, which is linked to ingot rates and is about Rs 5,000 to Rs 6,000 per tonne cheaper than ingot, has not decreased. It is still quoted on the same scale as that of ingot. This situation has given a shock to local manufacturers of ingot because scrap is the main component for making it and when it is available at the same rate (as that of ingot), then why will manufacturers run their factories and incur losses.”According to Kulwant Singh, general secretary of the Sewing Machine Development Club, “There has been a decrease of Rs 2,000 per tonne in the rates of pig iron recently and it is now available for about Rs 42,000 per tonne. But the rate of scrap, which is an essential raw material for making sewing machine and bicycle parts and casting components of different types, has not dipped. Same is the case with the rates of chemicals and other metals and labour. We are in a fix due to this situation, as after coming to know about the decrease in rates of pig iron, our customers have started asking us to decrease the selling price of older orders that are under process.”According to Rajkumar Singla, president of Fasteners’ Suppliers’ Association of Ludhiana, “Earlier we were in trouble due to high rates of raw materials of different types, but now the decrease in prices of a few of them has increased our woes. So as of now we are neither purchasing any raw material nor taking any orders until rates of all the connected components also decrease.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/ingot-prices-down-no-change-in-scrap-rates-has-bizmen-in-a-fix/articleshow/87766141.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Lucknow||Haze sheet hangs over city during day||Lucknow: Partly cloudy sky and a thin sheet of haze led to drop in day temperatures as well as visibility in the city on Wednesday. While the sky was partly cloudy because of moisture incursion following change in the wind pattern, the spike in air pollution led to the formation of haze. The maximum and minimum temperatures were 27.8 degrees Celsius and 12.5 degrees Celsius, respectively, both a degree below normal. The visibility dropped to below 500 metres in some parts of the city towards the evening as the density of the haze increased during the day. State Met director JP Gupta explained that a low pressure area has formed over the Arabian Sea. As a result, moisture laden easterly winds are dominating the state skies, he added. Possibility of rainfall is less, but similar conditions are expected to prevail till Friday, he said. Experts said that increase in the moisture content in the area made conditions conducive to formation of haze. It was helped by low wind speed as well. “Tiny particles combine with mini-air droplets and hang in the atmosphere for a longer period, resulting in haze. When wind speed is higher, it blows away the pollutants,” they added, while suggesting people take anti-air pollution measures. This is the second time this month, when the city was enveloped by the haze.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/haze-sheet-hangs-over-city-during-day/articleshow/87767847.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Citing a report by Maharashtra Cyber, the nodal agency for cyber security and investigation, Thakur said violence broke out in Amravati on last Friday and Saturday. During these two days, a large misinformation campaign was unleashed on social media using #AmravatiViolence. “This shows that hardline groups from both the sides were involved in fomenting trouble,” said Thakur. On November 12, stone-pelting was witnessed in Amravati, Nanded, Malegaon and some other cities in Maharashtra during rallies taken out by Muslim organisations in protest against purported communal violence in Tripura. On November 13, a mob hurled stones at shops in Amravati’s Rajkamal Chowk and Muslim-dominated Namuna area during a bandh called by BJP, prompting police to impose a four-day curfew. According to Maharashtra Cyber report, 4,000 tweets were posted in a matter of just a few minutes. Videos, photos and messages of purported violence were shared through social media, which led to a law and order problem, said Thakur, who is Congress minister for women and child development in the MVA government. “People know who benefits from the polarisation that occurs after this kind of riots. Seeing this opportunity, these people have done all this,” alleged Thakur. Meanwhile, Maharashtra Cyber has identified at least 25 objectionable posts on Twitter, six on Facebook and five on Instagram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/violence-plotted-not-just-for-one-city-but-entire-maharashtra-minister/articleshow/87768827.cms||---

Considering a petition by SJR Kumar against Travancore Devaswom Board, which manages the hilltop shrine, a division bench of Justice Anil K Narendran and Justice PG Ajith Kumar has sought a report from the Sabarimala special commissioner. As per the plea, the petitioner is the general convenor of Sabarimala Karma Samithi, an organization that aims to protect the customs and traditions of the temple. It is alleged by the petitioner that using ‘satwik’ or pure materials for preparing ‘Nivedyam’ is an age-old practice and is highly necessary to maintain the customary practices and beliefs at the temple. Further, the petitioner contends that use of spoiled materials would create health hazards to devotees. Also, using halal-certified jaggery that is prepared as per the religious practices of another religion at the temple and using it in the offering to the deity amounts to violation of religious customs and rituals of the temple. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-seeks-report-on-use-of-halal-jaggery/articleshow/87766992.cms||---

The chief minister urged the central government to formulate policies to strengthen the states. Gehlot was addressing a public assembly at Jorwarpura village in Pipalda of Kota on Wednesday. He was accompanied by PCC chief Govind Singh Dotasara. They inspected the “Prashshan Gaon Ke Sangh” camp held at the gram panchayat. At least 22 departments of state government set up their counters at the camp to sort out various revenue, land, pension, water, electricity connection-related issues of the people. The chief minister reviewed the work at every counter and interacted with people. The CM handed a wheelchair to a specially-abled woman, Manjubai, of Jorawarpura village, and explained to her the utility of the wheelchair. "Due to Centre’s faulty policies, the prices are rising and it has never happened earlier. Petrol and diesel prices continued to rise day-by-day and crossed the Rs-100 mark and are now at Rs 113 -115," Gehlot said. "When the Centre reduces the fuel prices, it affects the state’s revenue that automatically comes down," he pointed out. CM Gehlot termed the Prashashan Gaon Ke Sangh camp a great success in reliving public grievances. At least 5,941 camps have been organised so far in 352 panchayats and over 6.09 lakh cases of mutation, 5.60 lakh cases of record correction, over 4,900 cases of residential land allotment, 6.55 lakh cases of various certificates, 70,000 cases of social security pension and over 31,300 cases of dispute over ways have been sorted out in the ongoing camps, he claimed.

An inconsolable Ananya (name changed), Jahan’s classmate and friend, who is speech and hearing impaired, narrated the entire incident through sign language before media persons. Ananya said that she and Jahan were waiting near the university’s limb centre to board the university bus for the main campus to submit their scholarship forms. The bus was parked at some distance and all of sudden the driver made it turn backward at high speed, crushing Jahan under the wheels, she added while requesting not to be named out of fear of disciplinary action. Similarly, another eyewitness, pleading anonymity, recalled that Jahan’s head was crushed and she started bleeding profusely. Though there was no movement in her body, students and university staff rushed her to the hospital where it was confirmed that she was no more with us, she added before breaking down. “Jahan was an intelligent student who had scored over 80 % in class X and 70 % in class XII. Her disability was never an obstacle, even in the first semester in the university where she performed well in all three subjects - Hindi, history and political science – of her course,” said a senior faculty member, who taught Jahan. She was among four siblings in the family and her father is a shopkeeper, she added. Students claimed that university authorities are also responsible because there were not adequate arrangements or facilities on the campus to deal with such emergency situations.

Sources said the Railway Board would issue an order soon in this regard. Currently, only tea or coffee, snacks and ready-to-eat packaged food, such as noodles, rajma-chawal and soup, are available on long-distance trains. By the end of this month, passengers are likely to be served their favourite dishes in trains like pre-Covid times. A railway official said, “Now that Covid cases are on the decline, there is a growing demand from passengers for regular meals.” Before Durga Puja, IRCTC had opened its food plazas at Howrah, Sealdah, Asansol, Durgapur and New Jalpaiguri stations. Asked whether the on-board catering services and other amenities for passengers are set to resume, officials in IRCTC, Eastern Zone, were tight-lipped. IRCTC (east) group general manager, Debashis Chandra, said, “As soon as we get the communication from the higher authorities, we shall make an announcement.” But sources said that IRCTC — the Indian Railways’ subsidiary that provides services like ticketing and tourism — has already started making preparations to restore its services, which were suspended due to the pandemic. The Railway Board is also likely to take a decision on providing bedrolls and blankets. Since March 2020, Railways had stopped the catering business due to the pandemic and incurred losses of more than Rs 1crore, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cooked-food-to-be-back-on-trains-by-end-of-month/articleshow/87766984.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

Covid cases show sharp spike in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: In the 24 hours ending at 5pm on Wednesday, Gujarat recorded 54 new positive cases – the highest in 131 days. The last time the state had seen the cases above 50 was on July 10 at 53. Moreover, with discharge of 16 patients, the state added 38 positive cases, a rise of 15% in a day which is one of the highest in the recent past for the state. Now the active cases stand at 291, the highest since July 27 or 114 days. The worrisome trend of Ahmedabad contributing half of the state’s daily positive cases continued with the city accounting for 28 or 51% of the cases. So how does the trend measure up to the post-Diwali first wave in 2020? The analysis reveals that after two weeks (14 days) of the Diwali day, last year the rise compared to Diwali day was 42% - from 1,124 to 1,598. In 2021, however, the number has shot up by 86% from 29 to 54. Another difference shown is the distribution of daily positive cases. Out of 1,598 cases on November 28 last year, 61% were from the four major districts – Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot. In 2021, on Wednesday 83% of the daily cases were recorded from the four districts, showing a large concentration in urban areas, especially in Ahmedabad, which increased its share from 22% last year to 51% this year.

The 53-year-old seer fell back on a chair with his voice fading, which shocked thousands of his followers who were witness to it. The incident occurred on November 6, but came to light later, after a video of the same started doing the rounds on social media. The event was organised to mark his birthday. He was talking about how birth is accidental and death is mandatory for every living creature in this universe, and how one can overcome mental stress through spirituality, and engaging in daily work with a pious attitude. He took charge of the mutt recently, after getting the blessings of his mentor Guru Mata Neelambika Mataji. He has been actively involved in social work since the age of 26. He had opened an ashram for practising yoga, and ran an orphanage for homeless children. Neelambika Mata said that she is yet to recover from the shock of his passing away in such a manner. “He was fit and had no ailments. However, he appeared a little tired after he took charge of the mutt,” she said. She said that he was loved by God, and hence passed away peacefully. His last rites were performed in the presence of thousands of his followers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/seer-suffers-cardiac-arrest-while-delivering-sermon-dies/articleshow/87765455.cms||---

Over 1.5 lakh students of Classes I- IV have not been attending schools physically since March last year. Senior officials from Nashik education department confirmed to TOI that the state education department is actively considering the idea of resuming physical classes for primary students. The department will approach chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to seek his nod. Ratan Luth, former president of Association of Nashik Schools, an organisation of English-medium schools, said, “Allowing physical classes for the primary section students would be a judicious decision by the state education department.” The zilla parishad and the Nashik Municipal Corporation authorities said that they would not face any issues to start the primary section. They said that ever since the physical classes for senior students began before Diwali there were no hiccups in conducting the sessions. Parents were also eagerly waiting for the schools to start. “It will take at least six months to cover the developmental lag in children with regards to education and psychological health,” said Shweta Gupta, whose child is in class III. The teachers have cautioned parents against jumping to conclusions in case of any case in the school. “After the schools reopened, there have been negligible Covid cases among the students or staff. Schools will follow all protocols and parents should not press the ‘panic’ button,” said Nandalal Dhande, the president of Headmasters’ Association of Private Schools. Nilufer Chavan, the headmistress of Wisdom High, said that the government should now do away with the online classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/demand-grows-for-physical-classes-for-primary-section/articleshow/87765382.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Anand rural police on Wednesday nabbed two for pelting stones on moving vehicles along the Anand stretch of the expressway on November 2. According to cops, the duo had pelted stones on vehicles when they were allegedly in an inebriated state. “It was drunken mischief. They had challenged each other but they had later got scared and ran away from the spot. Our teams nabbed them based on CCTV footage and tip from locals regarding their involvement,” said Anand district superintendent of police Ajit Rajian. The accused identified as Khapil Pasaya (36) and Sanjay Vasava (35) are both residents of Indiranagari near Gopi talkies area of Anand. The duo have told the cops that since they did not have work that day, they had got drunk and later pelted stones on vehicles that were passing by the expressway. The stone pelting had however left many passengers terrified as vehicle movement was at its peak during the festive season. The stone pelting had damaged the windshields of a couple of vehicles. Anand rural police had registered the complaint under section 308 of the IPC for pelting stones on four cars and three trucks near railway overbridge 18 near Samarkha crossroads on the expressway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/2-held-for-stoning-vehicles-on-fast-lane/articleshow/87766327.cms||---

They need not be fluent in European languages to study in Europe, particularly in France. Most of the programmes are taught in English. Studying in overseas countries is much easy with scholarship these days,” he said. “As many as 1,000 French companies are based in India and they look for Indian students who had an experience in France.”The centre, launched on the occasion of International Students' Day, will facilitate networking with overseas institutions to have collaborative students exchange programmes, a university representative said. It will create research opportunities for students and teachers, besides offering diplomas, certificates and short-term courses.ACIE will shine as a centre for students to develop their skills, adapting to multiculturalism and multiple languages and adding values in the direction of research & development and employment opportunities, said chief guest of the event Archana Thakur, joint secretary of the University Grants Commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/avinashilingam-centre-for-intl-edu-inaugurated/articleshow/87766994.cms||---

While chlorination kills most of the bacteria, the concentration should not be more than the permissible limit, as it may lead to other health issues,” he said.Though chlorine level of 3-4ppm is ensured in overhead tanks, by the time water reaches households, the level drops to 0.2ppm, an official of the Sirumugai town panchayat said. “Health inspectors will regularly check the ppm level to ensure that the supplied water is potable,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/superchlorination-drive-launched-by-local-bodies/articleshow/87766996.cms||---

Besides the bigger players like BJP, SP, Congress and BSP, some Nishad leaders have formed their own parties and are aiming to contest seats having a sizable share of Nishad votes. Nirbal Indian Shoshit Hamara Aam Dal (NISHAD) Party and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) are the prominent ones, while another outfit Rashtriya Mahan Gantantra Party (RAMGP) is also aiming to contest the upcoming elections. RAMGP has its presence largely in west UP, unlike the other Nishad-centric parties which are more active in Purvanchal. The party is targeting the votes of Kashyaps and Binds, which are Nishad sub-castes. Bareilly, Badaun, Amroha, Shahjahanpur, Moradabad, Aligarh, Etah, Mainpuri, Firozabad, Bijnor, Mathura, Agra, Pilibhit, Aligarh, Kanpur and Unnao have significant presence of ‘Kashyap’ voters. “There are around 50,000 to 60,000 Kashyap voters in some seats of these districts but we are seeking support of voters from all castes and sections,” said party office-bearer Nishad Veerpal Gehlot. Targeting Vikassheel Insaan Party, he said, “VIP could not get reservation for Nishads in Bihar where it is in power, so how will it do it in UP? Dr Sanjay Nishad got his son elected as BJP MP and is himself a BJP MLC, is there anything else to say?” “RAMGP was registered in 2011, and we contested the 2012 and 2017 assembly elections on our own. In 2017, our talks for alliance with BJP failed at the last moment,” he added. Our party also contested Bihar assembly elections last year and is looking for an alliance with BJP, Congress or SP in UP, if offered a respectable number of seats, or we will go alone, Gehlot said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/battle-for-nishad-votes-intensifiesanother-outfit-ramgp-enters-fray/articleshow/87767893.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Bullet train project: Additional 25% for all consenting land sellers||MUMBAI: With the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project facing resistance from tribals in Palghar district, the National High Speed Rail Corporation Ltd (NHSRCL) has now agreed to pay an additional bonus of 25% to consenting land sellers. So far, only 30 hectares of the 180-hectare private land in the district has been acquired by direct purchase. With most of the protests coming from tribals in Palghar, Dahanu and Talasari, the district administration has now decided to go in for compulsory land acquisition. If land is forcibly taken away, the owners get 25% less than what is fixed by the district committee acquiring land. Collector Dr Manik Gursal last month wrote to the NHSRCL, seeking a 25% consent bonus to consenting parties. “In direct acquisition, land owners got 125% of land cost. In compulsory acquisition, they will now lose 25%. NHSRCL has allowed us to acquire land and pay 100% of the cost,” said Gursal. The first commercial run of the train has been pushed to 2026, due to land acquisition delays. With 75% land acquired in Gujarat, the trial run on a 50km stretch is likely to happen from Surat to Bilimora. The deadline for the trial run was revised to 2023 In Maharashtra, only 33% land acquisition has taken place, and in Palghar district, 27% land has been acquired. The total stretch of the project is 508.17km, of which 155.76km is in Maharashtra. In Palghar district, most of the land spread over the 109.06km belongs to villages that come under the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) (PESA) Act. “As of now, only nine of the 22 villages under PESA are still not willing to give away their land,” said Gursal, adding that 15 hectares of the 20 hectares of government land has been acquired. Sameer Vartak, a Vasai-based activist, said, “The government is silent on the environment assessment report. People having land around the route will not get any compensation but will have to bear with the problems when a high speed train (350km per hour) passes by.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bullet-train-project-addl-25-for-all-consenting-land-sellers-in-mumbai/articleshow/87768587.cms||Sandhya Nair

---||Coimbatore||DMK aims to capture Kongu land in urban local body polls||COIMBATORE: “Kongu la ini evanukkum illa pangu” (no more share in Kongu land for anyone), screams a wallposter by DMK men on Avinashi Road in the city. ‘Therikka vidalama, ullatchi therthalil’ (shall we rock in local body polls), reads another poster by the ruling partymen in the city. The posters are not the only signs that the DMK is gearing up for the urban local body polls in the state, particularly in the western districts. The party is in no mood to suffer another defeat in Coimbatore, where it lost all the 10 seats in the assembly elections. “We have to win all the 275 wards in the city corporation, municipalities and town panchayats in the district,” electricity minister V Senthil Balaji told the party workers at a meeting on Tuesday. The DMK has started receiving applications from the partymen to contest the polls in Coimbatore, much ahead of other districts. The DMK has been preparing the ground for the urban local body polls in the district for the past few days, debuting Senthil Balaji to hold ‘makkal sabha’ programmes. Balaji has visited 150 places across the district, including all the 100 wards in the city corporation limits, met residents and collected petitions from them. He has assured to meet all their demands. Chief minister M K Stalin is, meanwhile, all set arrive in the district coming Monday (Nov 22) on a two-day visit and unveil new projects. For now, the priority for the DMK clearly seems to be Coimbatore and Salem, the native of opposition leader Edappadi K Palaniswami. If Senthil Balaji has been made incharge of Coimbatore, municipal administration minister K N Nehru, another taskmaster, has been deputed to Salem. Nehru has launched a three-day grievance redressal meeting at places such as Attur, Mettur and VAzhapadi, which are headed for urban local body polls. “All the demands of the people will be fulfilled on a priority basis,’’ he said in Salem. A similar exercise has been launched by the DMK Kanyakumari west district secretary and IT minister T Mano Thangaraj. He has been organizing ‘Theervu Thalam’, an interactive platform, in town panchayats in the district. DMK men in Madurai and Trichy too have started preliminary work. “There is active lobbying for tickets,” said a DMK functionary in Madurai. The leaders are, meanwhile, utilising the rain situation to reach out to residents in urban areas. The ruling partymen in Trichy said the applications were likely to be received from the aspirants in a week. Action in the DMK rivals’ camps appears to be divided. While the BJP has begun poll work in the form of brainstorming sessions to work out a poll strategy, the AIADMK is yet to catch up. The BJP, in fact, was the first to ask cadres to submit applications from November 7, but it had to slow down because of the rain. The BJP has formed urban local body poll panels comprising leaders like Pon Radhakrishnan, L Murugan, C P Radhakrishnan, H Raja and Vanathi Srinivasan. AIADMK men agree that they need to quicken the process and gear up for the polls. The Tamil Nadu State Election Commission, meanwhile, held a meeting in Chennai on Wednesday and discussed preparations for the urban local body polls. At the meeting that was chaired by state election commissioner V Palanikumar, health secretary J Radhakrishnan spoke about Covid precautionary measures to be taken during the polls.

Gandhi, 51, sought quashing of a 2019 summons issued to him by the Girgaon Metropolitan Magistrate in Mumbai and a stay on the proceedings, in the interim. He said, “there is absolutely no truth to the complaint and due to his standing as an elected Member of Parliament, he is exposed to frivolous and vexatious litigations by his political adversaries.” His petition said, “ The instant complaint is a classic example of a frivolous and vexatious litigation, motivated by the sole purpose of furthering one’s own latent political agenda.’’ Justice S K Shinde on Wednesday adjourned it to November 22, at the request of Gandhi’s advocate Kushal Mor. In November 2018, Mahesh Shrishrimal purportedly a member of the BJP, filed a complaint under section 500 of the IPC, said Gandhi, and on July 21, 2021 he received summons dated July 12. He complied by appearing on July 26 through his advocate. Despite the 2019 order, no summons were received till July 2021 and hence was “not aware” of the complaint, the petition said adding, only an “aggrieved person” can set the criminal defamation law in motion and the complainant hasn’t shown he is aggrieved. The complaint is “misconceived, baseless and nothing but to …tarnish the public image of (Gandhi),” the petition said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rahul-gandhi-moves-hc-to-quash-2019-court-summons/articleshow/87768598.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: ‘Agri output dips 20% in 2021 compared to last year’||JAIPUR: A data released by the Rajasthan Khadya Padarth Vyapar Sangh states that there is a 20% fall in the production of agricultural commodities in Rajasthan compared to last year (2020). While there is a 20% fall in the production of bajra, there is a 35% decrease in the production of cotton and 30% in the production of moong. The data analysed by the sangh also states that with the fall in the production of agricultural produce, there will be a rise in the price of items in the market. “The production of bajra will go down from last year’s 39 lakh tonne to 34 lakh tonne this year. Of the total production of bajra, 70 per cent has been damaged this year due to rain. This has led to a difference of Rs 400 in the price of damaged and good quality bajra (Rs 1,600 per quintal for damaged bajra and to Rs 2,000 per quintal for good quality bajra). Compared to last year’s 17 lakh gaanth of cotton, only 13-14 lakh gaanth will be produced this year,” said Babulal Gupta, chairman, Rajasthan Khadya Padarth Vyapar Sangh. “Last year, the production of moong was 14-15 lakh tonne. This year, it will come down to 12 lakh tonne. The production of soyabean has gone down from 8 lakh tonne to 1 lakh tonne. The production has gone down due to heavy rainfall this year,” said Gupta. “The production of groundnuts has remained the same as last year, which is 20 lakh tonne.” “The mandi traders get a direction from this data about the course of doing business in future. The shortage in production will not just impact tax collection at the mandis, but also revenue of the government,” he added. “Moreover, in the Bharatpur belt, the sowing of bajra by the farmers was less compared to last year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/agri-output-dips-20-in-2021-compared-to-last-yr/articleshow/87767919.cms||---

In a memorandum submitted to the ZP administration, Maharashtra Rajya Prathamik Shikshak Sangh has pressed for restarting of schools up to class IV in both rural and urban areas. “While schools for students from class V and above started since October 20, there is a need to resume classroom teaching for students upto class IV. The Covid-19 cases are contained to a large extent and therefore, students from all primary sections should be allowed to attend the classes,” Rajesh Hiwale, spokesperson of the teachers’ association, said. Stating that the virtual learning was proving less effective among primary students, Hiwale said the closure of schools was also hampering their emotional and social growth. Kailwas Gaikwad, Aurangabad district general secretary of Prathamik Shikshak Sangh, another teachers’ body, said the classroom teaching for students upto class IV should begin after the Diwali vacations. “Schools from rural areas are slated to reopen from November 22 and we want the government to take a favourable decision in next few days,” he said. Authorities from the education department of Aurangabad ZP said the official decision on resuming classes upto class IV was expected shortly. “The government is expected to take another review of the Covid situation before taking a final call,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/teachers-bodies-want-primary-schools-to-reopen/articleshow/87765393.cms||---

The committee chairman Devang Dani clarified that the BJP party high command had asked them to completely distance themselves from the campaign in the wake of enrolment drive under the PM Street Vendor's Atma Nirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi) where vendors running egg eateries and many other food items are covered. Devang Dani, chairman of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s (AMC) town planning and estate management committee on Wednesday said that the civic body will only seize or evict those food vendors whose carts are causing major traffic obstructions. “We will only seize carts when it is an absolute necessity. Only those street vendors will be asked to vacate or relocate whose carts are causing major obstructions in traffic,” Dani said. On Monday, November 15, Dani had said, “The standing committee had passed a similar resolution to evict non-vegetarian food carts in 2015 or 2016. However, it was not implemented in spirit. We will begin a sustained operation Tuesday onwards.” A day after, on Tuesday, Dani had said, “The drive is not aimed at only non-vegetarian food carts. We are also evicting vegetarian food carts which are encroaching public roads and creating traffic obstruction. We are taking action under section 232 of GPMC Act 1949 which does not discriminate against vegetarian or non-vegetarian.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/drive-against-non-veg-vegetates/articleshow/87767026.cms||---

The phenomenal growth of the MSME sector has proved to be a game-changer for the state and will play an important role in the upcoming elections, he added. Comparing the loan disbursal to MSMEs during the previous Samajwadi Party government with the current regime, the spokesperson said, “In 2016-17, when SP was in power, 6,35,583 MSMEs were provided loans worth Rs 27,202 crore. In 2020-21, 34,80,596 MSME units have been dispensed loans worth Rs 63,038 crore, while Rs 16,002 crore have been provided to 1,25,408 new MSME units between April 1 and November 10 this year.” About 14% of all MSME units in the country are in UP, and more than 1.5 lakh new units were set up in the state even during Covid times, he added. “More than Rs 3 lakh crores have been invested in Noida and other districts. With the state’s policies generating interest in the MSME sector, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath approved the setting up of MSME parks to bring maximum investment in this sector. The state’s first MSME park is being set up in Sectors 29 and 32 of Yamuna Expressway Development Authority. MSME parks are also being built in Agra, Kanpur, Moradabad, Varanasi, Azamgarh and Gorakhpur,” he said.

The government had held a virtual meeting on Wednesday with the stakeholders to explore that possibility. The state education department is expected to take a decision soon on re-opening schools for Classes 1 to 5. Hundreds of students in this segment, especially in rural areas, have been completely cut off from all forms of education for almost two years now. Sources said that in-person schooling for Classes 1 to 5 could begin from the first week of December. “During the pandemic, online education replaced classroom education, but it is clear that 100% learning has not been possible in this format,” M I Joshi, director, primary education, told the meeting’s attendees. “Based on your feedback, we will prepare a report and hand it over to the education minister by Monday.” Narayan Charan Swami, who is connected with educational institutions run by the Swaminarayan sect, said there is a need to reduce the course content for Classes 1 to 5 students. “It is high time that in-person schooling for Classes 1 to 5 students resumes,” he said. “Emphasis should be on developing listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills.” Raja Pathak, a trustee of a private school, said: “Swimming cannot be learnt unless one enters water. Similarly, education cannot be complete without the physical presence of students.” He added: “Online education is here to stay though, and we should harness its potential.” Bhikhabhai Patel of the Shikshak Mahasangh said that the government must not include primary school teachers in non-teaching activities for the next few months. Digvijaysinh Jadeja, the president of Gujarat Rajya Prathmik Shikshak Samiti, said students of Classes 1 to 5 have benefitted the least from online education. “I feel it is high time that in-person education resumes for students of this segment,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/resume-in-person-teaching-for-classes-1-5-stakeholders/articleshow/87767022.cms||---

This comes after there were repeated complaints of faulty electricity billing resulting in consumer dissatisfaction and revenue loss to the UP Power Corporation Limited. UP energy minister Shrikant Sharma said that the audit will be done from divisional to state level. “Day to day monitoring of the billing process is a must for improving the revenue position of UPPCL,” he said. The development comes over a fortnight after the corporation roped in five new billing agencies across the state. Sharma said that the billing related complaints should be resolved within 24 hours. “There should be no laxity on billing related complaints. Under no circumstances will the mistakes made in the past be repeated. Correct bill should be made available every month to the consumers on time,” he said, stressing that accountability should be ensured from the billing agency to the MD of the distribution company concerned. Sharma added that the state government was receiving a large number of complaints about consumers not getting bills on time. As per the readings only 34% of the consumers have been billed. He also pressed on the need of taking maximum benefit of the one-time settlement scheme.

The youth, Vasal Khan, succumbed to his injuries on Wednesday. After the incident, police lodged a case against five people under Sections 302, 147 and 148 of the Indian Penal Code and detained them for inquiry. Khans remains were handed over to his family after autopsy. Barmer SP Deepak Bhargava said three or four friends of Khan’s thrashed him and left him on the road thinking he was dead. When nearby villagers heard him scream, they informed his family, he said. On being informed, Chauhatan police station SHO Bhuttaram Vishnoi reached the spot and took him to the Barmer Hospital from where he was referred to Deesa, but he succumbed to his injuries during treatment. Chauhatan DSP Narayan Singh Rawlot said prima facie the entire matter was related to a love affair. Khan was in a relationship with a girl in Rabasar village, he said. "It is possible that the four youths, who were relatives of the girl and were also friends with Khan called him to a hamlet and beat him up brutally," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/22-year-old-barmer-youth-beaten-to-death-over-love-affair/articleshow/87767928.cms||---

The video shows Akhilesh standing atop his ‘rath’ and saying: “these people of one particular colour... these chillumjeevis cannot take UP forward.” While Yadav did not specify the colour, Singh said that the former CM’s reference was towards the “saffron color”. The “chillumjeevi” remark was interpreted by the UP BJP chief as being made towards the seers and saints. Singh said that the entire Opposition including SP, Congress and BSP has always insulted the “bhagwa color” and “seers and saints”. “In fact there have been instances of seers being arrested in the SP and Congress regime,” he said, asserting that the opposition leaders have been “disregarding Hindu religion” and “feeling ashamed of being called Hindus”. The state president said that the Opposition had even challenged the existence of Ram, which is why they have been decimated. “Rajnitik kshetra mein sanskaar dena chahiye... sanskaar lena chahiye,” he said. Without taking anyone’s name, Singh said that “the person” did not stand by his father, his uncle and even sidelined senior leaders who helped in the formation of his party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-chief-tweets-akhilesh-video-says-oppn-leaders-always-insulted-bhagwa/articleshow/87767918.cms||---

The woman had also attacked her mother with a stone, fracturing her both legs.An investigation officer identified the accused as S Jothimani, a resident of Vinayagapuram at Saravanampatti. “She had separated from her husband Sivakumar a few years ago and was living with her widowed 75-year-old mother Chinna Ramathal.”The officer said Ramathal had recently approached the revenue divisional officer (RDO) and lodged a complaint against Jothimani, stating her daughter had taken her property documents away forcefully and after that she was not taking care of her properly. “The RDO subsequently launched an inquiry into the issue. Ramathal has a house on a 1,200sqft plot at Neelambur in her name.”Infuriated, Jothimani decided to murder her mother. “She woke up Ramathal on the intervening night of November 12 and 13, and tried to murder her by smothering her with a pillow. Hearing her cry in distress, Jothimani’s daughter Saral and son David went to her rescue. Meanwhile, Jothimani grabbed a boulder from outside the house and put that on her mother’s legs. Saral and David, however, saved her from further attack and rushed her to a private hospital,” the officer said.Ramathal later lodged a complaint with the Saravanampatti police, who registered a case against Jothimani under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code and arrested her on Wednesday. “She was produced before a judicial magistrate the same day and lodged in prison under judicial custody,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/42-year-old-woman-arrested-for-trying-to-murder-septuagenarian-mother/articleshow/87767021.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: ‘Walled City least affected by sinking of land’||AHMEDABAD: The only place in the city which has experienced negligible land subsidence in the past many years is the 610-year-old Unesco world heritage zone of the Walled City.  In fact the Institute of Seismological Research (ISR) study suggests that there has been a rise of 75.59m in groundwater level in this area, thus preventing land subsidence in the zone. Overall, the study suggests that there has been a high subsidence in the southeast and western parts of the city. A moderate subsidence in east-central part and a low subsidence in the Central Zone. A senior Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) official of the engineering department told TOI that land subsidence was never examined during town planning and engineering plans. “It is a matter of research that the number of cave-ins that happen in certain zones may be due to cracks that develop in the civic lines due to gradual subsidence issue in those areas.” Each day, the AMC supplies 1,369 million litres of to roughly 72 lakh citizens. But daily, the municipal corporation receives 1,739 million litres of sewage. The difference indicates that Amdavadis draw 370 million litres of extra water from the ground every day. The ISR study claims that groundwater drawn for drinking purpose is not the only causes of ground subsidence. The land subsidence in southeastern parts of the city also includes a large portion of agricultural fields in Daskroi taluka, while in the adjacent western area near Bopal there are large agricultural fields that also pump water. Clearly, ground subsidence in Ahmedabad is the combined outcome of groundwater extraction for drinking, Industrial and agricultural purposes. “Long-term water uptake results in ground subsidence mainly due to pore pressure reduction in the aquifer system and further due to surface loading by the construction activities in urban areas,” claims the ISR study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/walled-city-least-affected-by-sinking-of-land/articleshow/87767081.cms||Paul John
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Defence corridor foundation in Jhansi by PM Modi on 19th||LUCKNOW: After inaugurating the 341km Purvanchal expressway from Sultanpur, PM Narendra Modi on Friday will lay the foundation of the Rs 400-crore UP Defence Industrial Corridor (UPDIC) project in Jhansi in the presence of all three armed forces service chiefs. Executed by Bharat Dynamics Ltd, the project entails setting up a plant to produce propulsion systems for Anti-Tank Guided Missiles in the Jhansi node of UPDIC. The development could potentially mark BJP’s nationalistic pitch in the run-up to state polls early next year. The Light Combat Helicopters that PM will hand over to the IAFThe LCH incorporates advanced technologies and stealth features for effective combat roles. To give a thrust to ‘Atma Nirbhar Bharat’ in the defence sector, the PM will formally hand over indigenously designed and developed equipment to armed forces service chiefs,” a statement from the PMO said. This includes handing over of HAL-designed and developed Light Combat Helicopter to Chief of the Air Staff; drones and UAVs designed and developed by Indian start-ups to Chief of the Army Staff; and DRDO-designed and Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) manufactured advanced electronic warfare suite for naval ships to the chief of naval staff. The LCH incorporates advanced technologies and stealth features for effective combat roles. The deployment of Indian UAVs by IAF is also proof of the growing maturity of the Indian drone industry ecosystem. The Advanced EW suite will be used in different naval ships, including destroyers and frigates. Around 5pm, PM Modi will dedicate multiple initiatives of the defence sector at ‘Rashtra Raksha Samparpan Parv’, which was flagged off by defence minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday. The event will continue till November18 as part of ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’ celebrations. Modi will also launch the NCC Alumni Association to provide a formal platform to enable NCC alumni to reconnect with NCC. A former NCC cadet, Modi will be enrolled as the first member of the association, which is touted to assist in “nationbuilding”. At the same time, Modi will flag off the national programme of simulation training for NCC cadets to scale up simulation training facilities for all the three wings of NCC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pm-to-lay-foundation-of-rs-400cr-defence-corridor-in-jhansi-with-atma-nirbhar-thrust/articleshow/87767938.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Akhilesh Yadav jolted before polls, four SP MLCs defect to BJP||LUCKNOW: Months ahead of assembly polls, BJP received a riveting shot in the arm on Wednesday when four sitting MLCs of the Akhilesh Yadav led Samajwadi Party defected to the saffron camp. The four lawmakers who joined BJP included Narendra Bhati, C P Chand, Ravi Shankar Singh and Rama Niranjan. The defections came amid speculations of a covert coup by BJP to unleash a stunning punch on SP, which has been positioning itself squarely against the ruling party in run-up to the assembly elections. Notably, all four MLCs have their tenure in the upper house till March 7. “Aaj Akhilesh Yadav ko neend nahi aayegi (SP chief Akhilesh Yadav will not be able to sleep today),” said UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh after inducting the four SP MLCs in the party at the state BJP headquarters in Lucknow. Claiming the four lawmakers will strengthen BJP, Singh categorically asked the newly inducted leaders to ensure their supporters at booth and sector levels also join BJP. Bhati, a native of Dadri in Gautam Buddh Nagar, had grabbed eyeballs for opening a front against IAS officer, Durga Sakhti Nagpal, who launched a massive crackdown on the sand mining mafia in GB Nagar during the SP regime. Hailing from the politically influential Gurjar community in west UP, Bhati was elected to the upper house from Bulandshahr local authority quota on a SP ticket in 2016. Nagpal, then SDM of Noida, was suspended by the SP government over an allegation of bulldozing a mosque wall in 2013. The officer, who is currently posted as a deputy secretary in the Union ministry of commerce, was then backed by BJP. The induction of Bhati in BJP gains pertinence in the backdrop of the farmers’ stir against three farm laws impacting parts of NCR and restive west UP. Likewise, CP Chand, is a Dalit from the political backyard of CM Yogi Adityanath, Gorakhpur. Elected from Gorakhpur-Maharajganj local authority quota in 2016, Chand contested 2012 state elections from Chillupar assembly seat on a SP ticket, but lost to Rajesh Tripathi of BSP. His father late Markandey Chand represented the erstwhile Duriapar assembly seat in Gorakhpur in 1980 as INC (U) candidate. In 1989 and 1991, he won as a Janata Dal candidate while in 1996 he won on a BSP ticket. Chand later switched to Lok Jan Shakti Party in 2002 and then to BJP in 2007, but lost on both occasions. Ravi Shankar Singh aka Pappu Bhaiyya, a Thakur, is a native of Ballia and a relative of former PM Chandra Shekhar, whose son Neeraj too had switched to BJP from SP in 2019 and was nominated to Rajya Sabha. Ravi’s defection to BJP gains significance amid hectic political activity in Poorvanchal region, which is being assiduously eyed by various political outfits. Similarly, Rama Niranjan, an OBC, hails from the Bundelkhand region and represents SP in the council from the Jhansi-Jalaun-Lalitpur local authority quota. Her husband, R P Niranjan, president of UP Polytechnic Lecturer Association, too joined BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhilesh-jolted-four-sp-mlcs-defect-to-bjp/articleshow/87767931.cms||Pankaj Shah

The terminal will be run by Adani airports. A trial run was also conducted on Tuesday with representatives of all the freight operators to acclimatize them with the operations at the new terminal, according to top sources. “All necessary approvals are in place and the trial runs were conducted. It is expected that the new cargo terminal will be operationalized over the next 10 days,” said a source. The upcoming cargo terminal, which is set up at the Terminal-III of the SVPI airport which was formerly the Haj terminal, will have an estimated capacity of handling at least 2,500 metric tonne cargo in a single day as is learnt from top sources. With the expansion of the cargo terminal, the city airport will begin to handle more volumes of international cargo besides domestic supplies. A source privy to the development also said that the new terminal will have an updated security in place along with modern equipment to supplement handling of large volumes of cargo more effectively. The terminal will be spread over 1,500 sq m land parcel at the SVPI airport campus. At present, all the international cargo is handled by the Ahmedabad Air Cargo Complex, which is managed by the Gujarat State Export Corporation (GSEC) Limited. Estimates suggest that the SVPI airport handled some 60,749 metric tonne cargo during the financial year 2020-21. Being a manufacturing-heavy state, a range of import-export shipments comprising raw materials to finished goods including pharmaceutical products, chemicals, textiles, agriculture produce, electronics, precious metals, medical devices and related equipment among others, are handled in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/svpi-cargo-terminal-to-start-working-next-week/articleshow/87767056.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Nawab Malik submits additional affidavit in defamation case by Sameer Wankhede’s father||MUMBAI: NCP minister Nawab Malik on Wednesday filed an additional affidavit before the Bombay high court in response to a Rs 1.25 crore defamation suit by Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) zonal director Sameer Wankhede’s father Dhyandev, for an injunction against the minister from posting defamatory statements against him and his family on social media. The matter will come for passing order on interim relief on Thursday. Malik’s latest affidavit includes Sameer’s school admission documents and primary school-leaving certificate, wh-ere he has been mentioned as ‘Muslim’. He also submitted that he has verified the documents with BMC records and the schools where Sameer has studied. Malik has alleged that despite being born a Muslim, Sameer secured a central government job claiming to be from the scheduled caste. Last week, the HC had asked Malik if he took due care while uploading Sameer’s birth certificate that showed interpolation on it. Justice Madhav Jamdar had said: “From day one I have been saying...is this the manner in which a BMC officer will write ‘SAMIR’ (in upper case).” He added that “there are also different handwritings” on the certificate. In his response, Malik had said that he had “reasonably verified” Sameer’s birth certificate and a ‘nikahnama’ of his first marriage. Dhyandev, a retired state excise officer, had told the HC that his son’s original birth certificate may have been submitted in school, and the one produced by Malik has the name Dawood rectified to Dhyandev. He said because of his son-in-law’s arrest, Malik, to hit back at Sameer, made allegations against his family without proof. Dhyandev had annexed 28 documents, including his caste certificate, to show he was always known as Dhyandev and never as Dawood. A statement of his late wife that she was Muslim, married a Hindu and converted was also annexed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-malik-submits-additional-affidavit-in-defamation-case-by-wankhedes-dad/articleshow/87768612.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar

The fares for these trains will now change as per the class of travel and type of train. Railway activists have welcomed the move that, according to them, would lead to marginal drop in fares. “The fares for special trains and holiday special trains were marginally higher. Hence, there was a demand for restoring the fare structure to pre-Covid times in the interest of passengers,” he said. While the SCR authorities did not have information about possible revised fares, railway activists said a drop between 5 and 10% was expected. The 76 trains, which will run with regular numbers, include major trains passing through Marathwada like Aurangabad-Nanded and Nanded-Amritsar. Meanwhile, in order to clear extra rush of passengers, the SCR will run daily special trains between Purna-Adilabad, Parli-Adilabad, Akola-Purna and Akola-Parli. The trains will be started in a phased manner from November 20 to November 23. “All special trains consist of general second class coaches and will have unreserved express fare,” said an official release. Amid relaxed Covid restrictions, there was a strong demand from the passenger community for starting trains on the lines of pre-Covid times.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/scr-special-trains-to-run-with-regular-numbers/articleshow/87765440.cms||---

This rate is more than double the national rate of crime against children in the last five years, which stands at 17%. The analysis is based on the findings of the latest Crime in India (2020) report by NCRB. The total number of crimes against children reported in 2016 in the state stood at 4,034. This increased to 6,580 in 2020. However, when compared to 2019, there's a drop of 10.9% in the total number of cases recorded. Despite strict restrictions during the pandemic, on an average, eight children were reported missing in the state daily. Shedding light on the status of missing children, Soha Moitra, regional director, CRY, said, “Despite stringent restrictions and surveillance to prevent any movement during the lockdown months last year, 3,179 children were reported to have gone missing in the state. More alarmingly, in 82% of such cases, the victims were girls. CRY, through its status report, 'Covid and Missing Childhood' released earlier this year, had raised concern over the grim issue of missing children in the state. The NCRB-2020 report has further substantiated the urgent need to look into the issue.” On an average eight children were reported kidnapped or abducted per day in 2020. According to NCRB data, 2,769 cases of kidnapping and abduction were reported in the state in 2020 and 2,835 children were kidnapped or abducted. However, the figure has decreased compared to the previous year.Also, the percentage of kidnappings and abductions were the highest among all types of crime against children. In all, 42% cases of overall crimes against children reported in 2020 were kidnapping and abduction. The state also reported the highest number of rapes of minors in the country in 2020 revealed the NCRB data. In all 1,279 cases of minor rapes were registered in the state last year, an average of four cases daily. This figure is 19% of the overall crime against children in the state. “The Crime in India report is of special significance since it provides glimpses of the situation of crimes in the country, including child protection during the Covid pandemic. School closures during Covid, mobility restrictions to contain the spread of the pandemic coupled with economic slowdown disproportionately impacted livelihoods and household economic and food security of marginalised families. Therefore, it was highly likely that it contributed to increasing vulnerabilities of children to child labour, marriage, trafficking as well as gender-based violence, especially in states like Rajasthan where crime against children are considerably high,” she said. “Child marriage and labour are issues that represent a complex interplay of socio-economic and cultural practices, and, therefore, despite having legislations against these practices, continue to be under reported. According to NCRB 2020 data, a total of 30 cases of child labour and only 3 of child marriage were reported in Rajasthan which is very less compared to the previous year. In 2019, this figure was 48 and 19, respectively. This may lead to possibilities of these cases being under-reported in the state,” Soha said. “The implementation of various schemes has definitely led to certain progress in addressing crime against children in the state. However, with the pandemic adding more challenges there is a need to adopt innovative strategies,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ajmer/in-5-years-39-increase-in-crime-against-children/articleshow/87769857.cms||---

Although a declining trend has been observed even during the recent festive season, the health authorities have appealed to the public at large to not lower their guard against Covid-19 and undergo vaccination at the earliest, besides following Covid norms. The official data shows that at present, the Aurangabad district (including municipal limits) has the highest 95 cases, followed by Beed (55), Osmanabad (52), Jalna (36), Parbhani (32), Nanded (24), Latur (15) and Hingoli (5). Dr Pradeep Kulkarni, the Aurangabad district civil surgeon, on Wednesday said, people should realize that the Covid is still present even if the cases have declined. “Many foreign countries are already experiencing multiple waves of Covid-19 and therefore, it is wrong to assume that Covid-19 is over in India.” “The drop in cases can be linked with the vaccination and hence, we need to achieve 100% vaccination of the target population at the earliest,” he said. Kulkarni said parts of Marathwada bordering Ahmednagar are witnessing a relatively higher positivity rate. “Gangapur and Vaijapur talukas bordering with Ahmednagar district have higher positivity rate and aggressive testing is already underway,” he said. The progressive count of the Covid-19 patients in Marathwada since the outbreak in March last year has reached 6.29 lakh by Tuesday. It includes, 6.13 lakh recovered patients and 15,830 deaths. At 2.51%, the mortality rate in Marathwada is slightly higher than the state average of 2.12%.

The health department had announced the doctor’s suspension two days after the incident as the officials thought her to be a medical officer working under the health department. But later it came to the fore that she is a postgraduate medical student doing her internship at that hospital. She was not a medical officer of the state health department. Speaking to TOI, Rajendra Shinde, the doctor’s father, who is a retired government school principal, said his daughter has been doing her internship at the civil hospital for the last one year. She is in judicial custody and lodged in prison at Rahuri taluka of Ahmednagar. “Vishaka is pursuing her post-graduation in orthopaedics from Mumbai-based College of Physicians and Surgeons. She cannot be held responsible for the outbreak of the fire. I met her in jail a couple of days back. She is shattered and frustrated by her arrest. She told me her arrest is a blot when she is about to start her medical professional career,” said the father. The father denied police claims that Dr Shinde was not present in the ICU when the fire happened. “My daughter was very much present in the hospital. At the time of the incident, she was in the orthopaedic ward examining patients. On that day, she was also told to examine Covid patients in the ICU. She would have gone to the ICU after the orthopaedic ward. How can my daughter be at two places at the same time?” he asked. Both the IMA and the medical fraternity of the Ahmednagar civil hospital are unhappy with the manner in which Dr Shinde and the three nurses have been arrested, allegedly without properly investigating the entire incident. District superintendent of police Manoj Patil could not be contacted as he is on leave. But senior district police officials reiterated that Dr Shinde and the three staff nurses were supposed to be on duty at the ICU. But they did not react even after the fire broke out to rescue Covid patients. “Our investigations in the case are on. It was the relatives of the patients, braving the thick smoke that had engulfed the ICU, who took the patients out,” claimed the police officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/state-revokes-suspension-of-doc-held-over-hosp-fire/articleshow/87765472.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Dissent brews in Kerala unit of LJD over cabinet berth||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) state unit, led by MV Shreyams Kumar, is heading for a split. A group in the party led by its general secretaries Sheikh P Harris and V Surendran Pillai convened a meeting in Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday and served an ultimatum that state president Shreyams Kumar should resign from the post before November 20. The dissent within the party, which is an ally of the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF), that was brewing since the state assembly elections, has now worsened with representatives of four districts demanding the resignation of its president. They have also claimed the support of its lone MLA KP Mohanan and national leader Varghese George. However, Shreyams Kumar, who is LJD’s lone MP in Rajya Sabha from the state, has refused to budge, claiming that the party will take a call on the dispute. “The rebels will have to face severe consequences. The party will not allow any kind of indiscipline. The rebels have no majority in the party. Out of the 76-member state committee, only nine members attended the rebel meeting,” he said. Shreyams Kumar has convened the party state committee meeting on Saturday in which action against the rebels is likely to be taken. However, the rebels headed by two general secretaries have alleged that it was due to Shreyams Kumar that the party did not get a cabinet berth when all the other constituents in LDF received it. Mohanan was also upset over the fact that the party did not exert pressure for a cabinet berth in the LDF meeting. The dissidents are also unhappy over the corporation and board president posts given to the party. The dissidents are of the view that Shreyams’s insistence on Kalpetta constituency had cost the party a seat in the assembly polls. LJD had contested from three seats — winning from Kuthuparamba, where Mohanan scored the solitary win, while it lost in Kalpetta and Vadakara. However, Shreyams said the party had claimed seven seats in the LDF meeting and Harris was also part of the seat-sharing discussions prior to the polls.  “At no point have I tried to create a rift. Last week, a meeting was held to resolve the issues. But Sheikh P Harris refused to come,” said Shreyams Kumar. The rebels are now planning to meet party supremo Sharad Yadav to demand Shreyams’s ouster from the president’s post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/dissent-brews-in-state-unit-of-ljd-over-cabinet-berth/articleshow/87767105.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Robbery behind Jangpura double murder, say cops||NEW DELHI: Days after two women domestic helpers, who were from Darjeeling, were found murdered in K-Block of Jangpura Extension, five people were arrested for the gruesome killings. Police claimed that dacoity was the main motive and the key conspirator was a former housemaid’s nephew. While cops had earlier said they had seized Rs 90 lakh, including foreign currency, from the accused, on Monday they said nothing had been taken from the house. DCP (Southeast) Esha Pandey said one of the victims, Meena Rai (35), was found lying dead on her bed on the first floor. Her hands and legs were tied with plastic rope. Her mouth was taped and froth was also seen coming out of her mouth. “The second housemaid, Sujaila Gurung (40), was found lying dead in the drawing room on the second floor,” she added. Two teams under the supervision of ACP (operations) Manoj Sinha and ACP (Lajpat Nagar) Jai Narayan led by Aishvir Singh (inspector special staff) and SHO (Hazrat Nizamuddin) Kishore Kumar were formed to probe the case. The cops searched footage of 100-150 CCTV cameras of surrounding areas and noticed the five suspects. Their second clue was another CCTV footage in which the suspects were seen on a motorcycle. After analysing yet another footage, they were able to identify the number of the vehicle, which was registered in the name of Sachit Saxena. Saxena was the nephew of a previous housemaid, who had worked for around two years at the house. He used to come to the house to pick and drop his aunt. He came to know that Rs 30-40 lakh were kept there. During interrogation, he told police that he along with Prashant Basista, Dhananjay, Ramesh and Aniket had committed the double murder and dacoity. The other four accused were nabbed from different parts of the city while trying to flee to other states. Four of them entered the house after scaling the front wall. They then went inside the house from the back door, which was open. After committing the crime, while three of them took an autorickshaw, two went on foot hiding their faces from CCTV cameras. They had parked their bike 2-3 kilometres away. The next day, they came to know that the two women had died, so they decided to leave Delhi for a month. “They had planned to open a business with the looted money,” an officer said. All the accused had studied up to Class XII and had no criminal antecedents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/robbery-behind-jangpura-double-murder-police/articleshow/87767988.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Jaipur gets a new lease of life hosting an international match||JAIPUR: A good vibe and loud cheers all around, and a memorable evening made special by India’s five-wicket win in the opening match of the T20I series against New Zealand at the Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Stadium on Wednesday. A lot of action and nervy moments in the final stages added to the extra spice, making the first-ever T20I to be played in Pink City a great watch. Chasing 165, captain Rohit Sharma's fearless approach at the start and Suryakumar Yadav’s boldness in the middle overs lit up the stadium and provided just the kind of entertainment the capacity crowd had come looking for. Pradeep Solanki, a fan who watched the live action from the south-east stand, came to see the genius of Rohit, but was also happy with the match-winning effort of Suryakumar. “In the middle overs, he ensured the run rate did not go down and was so easily tonking the Kiwi spinners. He made the run chase easy after Rohit gave a flying start to India,” he said. Sameer Sharma, who came to see the match from Udaipur, echoed the same emotions. “Suryakumar’s knock was simply outstanding. All credit to him for the win today,” he said. While most of the spectators could be heard talking about Suryakumar’s slam-bang knock, there were also those who gave credit to Ravichandran Ashwin and Deepak Chahar for playing an important role with the ball. “Offie Ashwin’s fourth over when he took two wickets, including that of Mark Chapman (63 off 50 balls), made a lot of difference. Also, though local boy Deepak proved to be expensive, his last over in which he took Martin Guptill’s (70 off 42 balls) scalp, ensured the visitors could not score in excess of 175,” pointed out Nikhil Purohit. Chapman’s wicket came in the 14th over while Guptill was sent packing in the 18th over. As the spectacular action unfurled, unlike their regular ‘Halla Bol’ chant for Rajasthan Royals, the fans in Jaipur were heard chanting ‘Jeetega bhai jeetega, India jeetega’ for a change. Meanwhile, the city got a new lease of life hosting an international match after eight years, while it was a good start for India as the Dravid-Rohit era kicked off on a winning note.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/at-1st-t20i-in-city-rohit-dravid-era-kicks-off-on-a-winning-note/articleshow/87767976.cms||Mandakini Shalya
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Pani puri seller gets 10 yrs for sexual assault on 2-year-old||Mumbai: Observing that there is no substance in the defence submission that removal of garments was essential to establish sexual intent, a special Pocso court convicted and sentenced a 31-year-old pani puri seller to 10 years rigorous imprisonment for sexual assault on a 2-year-old girl in 2016. The conviction came in the absence of the child’s deposition in court. The court reasoned, “The child was of such tender age that she was incapable of understanding the nature of the act, and she was incapable of being examined in this court as a witness.” The accused used to sell pani puri in front of the child’s house. Among a dozen witnesses, the court relied on statements of the child’s aunt who found her crying with abrasions on her private parts and a neighbour who saw the accused taking the child and returning with her bawling. A doctor said sexual assault could not be ruled out. “All star witnesses examined by prosecution deposed naturally before this court, thereby inspiring confidence of this court. Their testimonies could not be shattered on behalf of the accused. There was no reason at all for them to implicate the accused falsely,” the court said. The court said there is no substance in the defence submission that pointing a finger at a person does not show culpability or that the name of the accused should have been stated by the child. “...a kid would continue to weep, if it is hurt by any person and would merely point its finger, instead of stating the name,” the court said. The court also observed that it is a matter of general child psychology that a child would point its finger at any person who hurts the child. —Rebecca Samervel||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pani-puri-seller-gets-10-yrs-for-sexual-assault-on-2-year-old/articleshow/87768617.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Oommen Chandy meets Sonia Gandhi, raises party revamp, Kerala leadership issues||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: AICC general secretary Oommen Chandy, who met Sonia Gandhi, is learnt to have complained against the style of functioning of the present leadership. Chandy raised issues concerning party revamp and the disciplinary action being taken against leaders in state. But, opposition leader VD Satheesan said party revamp cannot be stopped since AICC election process will take a year to complete. “Till then, party cannot be defunct and it needs office-bearers to move on,” he said. Chandy said in Delhi that he had discussions with AICC general secretaries Tariq Anwar and KC Venugopal and apprised them about the issues concerning the state. “I have specific opinion on party revamp, which has been communicated to them. But, I am not ready to disclose that to the media,” he said. Chandy is learnt to have complained that the present leadership is not having discussions on the decisions being taken in party forums. The political affairs committee (PAC), which is the highest decision making body of the party, is not meeting to take decisions. The new leadership has no trust on PAC and hence the high command should intervene in this matter. He alleged that disciplinary actions are being taken against leaders in the name of anti-party activities. He told the AICC president that all actions taken were unilateral and those who flayed the senior leaders in the party were punished. Chandy has urged the party high command to intervene in state’s issues. But, Satheesan made it clear that if senior leaders have grievances or issues, then party leadership is ready to have discussions. “Since we are the leadership, we are not hesitant in having discussions with them. We are ready to sort out issues,” he said. Meanwhile, Chandy said in New Delhi that Tariq Anwar will be reaching state to have more discussions with state leaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/chandy-meets-sonia-raises-party-revamp-state-leadership-issues/articleshow/87767132.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Ministers clash at cabinet meeting chaired by Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot||JAIPUR: School education minister Govind Singh Dotasra and revenue minister Harish Chaudhary had heated arguments during a cabinet meeting of the Rajasthan government on Tuesday, sources said. Chaudhary, who is also the Congress in-charge for Punjab, joined the meeting online as he was in Chandigarh. Dotasra alleged that the works in the revenue department related to the ‘Prashasan Gaon ke Sangh’ campaign were pending as the revenue minister was in Chandigarh. The post of tehsildars is vacant at many places and, during the campaign, the duties of tehsildar were delegated to naib tehsildars, but this has not been done this time, he complained. Chaudhary retorted saying, “If you tell me the work, I will do everything sitting in Chandigarh. Still, if it is necessary, I will come to Jaipur on a charter.” “Do not bully me with the charter,” Dotasra shot back. In the midst of this tussle, CM Ashok Gehlot had to intervene to settle the matter. Agriculture minister Lalchand Kataria and medical and health minister Raghu Sharma also raised the matter of pending works with the revenue department.Kataria said, “Pattas cannot be given in 'gramdani' villages as rules are coming in the way. People of 'gramdani' villages are upset over this issue. If this work is not done now, it will never happen. This bottleneck has not been removed yet though the campaign has started. The rules should have been changed before the campaign started,” he said. Raghu Sharma also joined the issue. He said despite the decision on people displaced by Bisalpur dam, no order has been issued so far. Playing down the incident, Chaudhary said the issues related to the revenue department raised by fellow ministers were valid and there were problems at many places. “It would not be correct to call the discussion a dispute. Only when there is a discussion on shortcomings, will they be corrected. All the pending issues related to revenue will be resolved,” he added. There was a similar clash between urban development and housing minister Shanti Dhariwal and Dotasra in a cabinet meeting in June this year. At that time, the issue was over the state not getting sufficient vaccines from the Centre and the PCC president's suggestion to all ministers to submit a memorandum to the President of India as part of an agitation. This was objected to by Dhariwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ministers-clash-at-cabinet-meeting-chaired-by-gehlot/articleshow/87767995.cms||Joychen Joseph

However, despite the showers, the weather in Kolhapur city remained balmy for most of the day. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a yellow alert for Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara and Solapur till Sunday, with probability of heavy to very heavy rain along with lightning and gusty winds in isolated parts of these four districts. As per the IMD, Kolhapur district received a total of 15.9mm, Sangli got 12.2mm, Satara 13.6mm and Solapur 0.6mm rainfall between Tuesday and Wednesday. In Kolhapur district, Chandgad region received the highest (34.8mm) rainfall, while Shirol region received the least rain (7.8mm). Weather expert Shantanu Patil said, “Rain is likely to continue till November 25. After that some weather change can be witnessed. The main reason is due to the low pressure area and associated cyclonic circulation over Arabian Sea. Winter is still far away for now.” Due to the rainfall, the minimum temperature has again gone up and doctors have advised people to take extra care. Dr Dileep Kanbargi, a general practitioner from Kolhapur, said, “The uneven rise and drop in mercury is making people ill. The number of patients coming with viral fewer, cold and cough cases has increased over the past week. People should avoid getting wet in rain and keep themselves protected by using woollen clothes and masks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/heavy-rain-lashes-kolhapur-dist-more-in-store-till-sunday/articleshow/87764731.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Aurangabad||Nanded range cops delete social media posts aimed at spreading hatred||Aurangabad: Cracking down on miscreants in the Nanded range — comprising Nanded, Latur, Hingoli and Parbhani districts — the police have acted against anti-social elements using social media platforms to peddle hatred and create rift. Nanded range deputy inspector general of police Nisar Tamboli told TOI: “Three offences and multiple non-cognizable offences have been registered against people putting up posts aimed at spreading disharmony and hatred.” In the past five days, the cyber police of these four districts have got nearly two dozen posts deleted, and according to senior officers, the drive against such messages and posts will continue. As per the data obtained from the police, Nanded cyber police spotted 24 posts that posed a threat to harmony. In all, 22 suspects who had posted these messages were summoned by the cyber police and 17 of the posts were deleted. An official said all these suspects were summoned to the police station, but after it was found that many of them were students, they were made to give a written apology and were let go with a warning. Probe revealed that two posts were posted by a Pune resident and a communication along with the link of the post has been shared with Pune city cyber police for further action. While, Latur cyber police registered three cases at three different police stations against suspects for posting misleading messages. Superintendent of police Nikhil Pingale said, “Our teams are keeping round-the-clock watch on suspects trying to incite violence.” Hingoli superintendent of police Rakesh Kalasagar said two NCs were registered against three suspects. They were issued notices before being released and the posts were deleted. While Parbhani cyber police could trace only one objectionable post, which on the request of the state agencies, was deleted by the social media platform. The cyber police summoned suspect and served him a notice and even issued an ultimatum. In Nanded, four offences have been registered for Friday’s violence, and so far, 67 have been arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/nanded-range-cops-delete-social-media-posts-aimed-at-spreading-hatred/articleshow/87765492.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Pune||More students joined govt schools in Maharashtra, 9% rise since 2018: Survey||PUNE: Fuelled by the uncertainties during the Covid-19 pandemic and online schooling, more students have joined government schools in Maharashtra in three years since 2018. The Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2021, facilitated and released by NGO Pratham on Wednesday, put this rise at over 9%. The enrolment in government schools in rural India crossed 70%, even higher than pre-Covid days. Educators said since schools went online, parents have preferred to enrol their children at the entry-level in government schools closest to their homes which boosted the rise in enrolment. The increase in students turning to public education in rural India, while temporary, was driven by financial distress and migrations, the report said. The report also found that the percentage of students who took tuitions has increased from 2018 to 2021. Currently, almost 20% of enrolled students from all grades took paid tuitions. The percentage was 40% when compared to the all-India level. Opting for tuitions had increased across almost all the states, a natural response to the prolonged school closure, the report said. The study also pointed out that economic disruptions had moved children out of private schools to public schools, but parents accessed tuition classes where they had to pay fees. In three years, 9% rise in students in govt schoolsThe report explained, “This may be due to the fact that tuition classes were a local phenomenon where payment may adjust flexibly and quickly based on demand and supply negotiated between the tutor and the family.” Former director of education Vasant Kalpande said the rise in enrolment in government schools is an effect of Covid-19 and the trend absolutely does not translate into improvement in quality of education. “I do not think this will continue. The parents who migrated back to their native places during Covid-19 have decided to take admission in the nearest possible school which the survey reflects,” he said. On the increase in private tuitions, Kalpande said that Maharashtra’s average is much lower than many other states and the all-India figures. He said the state had always followed this trend in comparison with the other states. Founder and CEO of Leadership for Equity, Madhukar Banuri said the real challenge will also be to look into the absolute numbers once schools reopen completely and account for students too. “The effect of inter-district and inter-state migration will play a role, and there is a serious lack of tracking children once they move out of the school or village. All indicators are pointing to a greater number of children dropping out or being pushed into child marriages. Actual figures from schools will give us a better estimate of the damage caused by Covid-19, in terms of access and equity for learning and well-being of children,” Banuri said. Compared to the all-India numbers, children in tuitions could be lower in Maharashtra, but the increase is not surprising since many need support, especially those in secondary school leading to board examinations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mumbai-in-3-yrs-state-sees-9-rise-in-students-joining-govt-schools/articleshow/87768637.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Delhi||Delhi: DTC hasn’t purchased a new bus since 2010 CWG||NEW DELHI: As the national capital faces an air emergency, Delhi government is trying to hire 1,000 private buses to augment the public transport fleet, which is functioning with reduced capacity due to Covid-19 restrictions. However, the city was facing an acute shortage of buses even before the pandemic. While the city needs at least 11,000 buses according to Delhi government’s own estimate, the fleet of Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) has been depleting over the last decade. The last time large-scale procurement happened was during the 2010 Commonwealth Games when modern low-floor buses were added to DTC’s fleet. TimesViewThe DTC was once the city's spine. The rise and spread of the Metro notwithstanding, it is incredible that the corporation hasn't procured a single bus since 2010. Buses reach where the Metro cannot. The two modes complement each other. Public transport must be boosted in a city where pollution is killing. More CNG buses, both public and private, should be procured.From a high of 6,204 buses in 2010, DTC’s fleet has reduced to 3,762, out of which 2,644 buses were procured from Tata Motors between 2007 and 2010 and are nearing end of life. To tide over the shortage, DTC had to request the State Transport Authority to allow its buses to run for 15 years from the date of registration, instead of 12 years as per JNNURM procurement contract norms. While DTC has been unable to procure buses for nearly a decade primarily on the issue of annual maintenance contracts (AMC), the number engaged through private concessionaires under the Cluster Scheme has gone up. In 2016, when the first odd-even scheme was rolled out, DTC had 4,121 buses, while there were around 1,600 buses operating under the Cluster Scheme. The number of buses under the Cluster Scheme is 3,033 now, taking the total public transport fleet to 6,795, which is higher than the figure a decade ago. However, the population of the city and demand for public transport has also gone up since. “The procurement process of more buses is on track,” transport minister Kailash Gahlot told TOI. “Many depots are also coming up and I’m personally reviewing construction and electrification of depots. Without depots to park buses, the number of buses can’t go up and this has been a bottleneck for us in adding more buses. The government is also constructing multilevel bus depots to tide over the lack of space available to create new ones,” he added. Gahlot said, “The induction of buses and construction and electrification of depots is a priority for us. I’m reviewing the progress every week. A thousand buses would have come if the BJP had not alleged a scam in the procurement process.” LG Anil Baijal had constituted a three-member committee following a complaint by BJP, which examined the tendering process and didn’t find any irregularities. However, it recommended floating fresh tenders for AMCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dtc-hasnt-purchased-a-new-bus-since-2010-cwg/articleshow/87767151.cms||Sidharatha Roy

This, as a result of a representation by NGO Cantonment Vikas Manch following TOI’s campaign covering issues faced by Cantonment residents. “We have addressed the representation to the general secretary of Parliament and urged to add this issue in the agenda for discussion in the upcoming session,” Cantonment Vikas Manch general secretary, S Ravinder, told TOI. “On behalf of the four lakh Cantonment residents, we will mount pressure on MPs from Telangana to raise the issue,” he added. The Winter Session of Parliament is set to commence on November 29 with Lok Sabha MPs from the state expected to raise the issue during discussions. Earlier, Secunderabad Cantonment MLA G Sayanna had raised the issue during the state assembly with opposition Congress also in favour of a merger. According to Venkatesh Goud, member of an RWA in Bolarum, with Centre likely to pass Cantonment Bill, 2020 in the upcoming session, the time is right for Union ministry of defence to make certain modifications in the bills to help civil areas merge with local bodies in order to better avail benefits from central and state government schemes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/scb-merger-demand-may-echo-in-parliament-as-ngo-submits-plea/articleshow/87767766.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Hyderabad||For Pochampally weavers, it’s still a battle for survival||HYDERABAD: On Wednesday morning, it was business as usual at Pochampally village — roughly 45 km from Hyderabad. Though news of it being recognised as one of the best tourism villages by the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO), had trickled in by then, it didn’t seem to add any sense of euphoria among its Ikat sari weavers. Though glad about the honour, most were still, singlemindedly, pushing towards that one goal — to earn 10,000 - 15,000 from weaving seven saris. “Sadly, this award is not going to benefit us in any way. Our lives are not going to change,” said Lakshmi B, who has been taking home 10,000 from seven saris for the last 10 years. She said it takes her about 40 days to complete the work. “It is the dealers, middlemen and our bosses, who have 10 to 15 weavers working for them, who will make the money. We will still be paid part wages,” she said. Her husband, also a weaver, gets 15, 000 for the same job. While the pandemic had pulled down the price of these saris by 2,000 (approx), it has revived now and are being sold for no less than 7,500. Yet, weavers continue to get a paltry sum for their effort, irrespective of how many days they put in. Perhaps that explains their lack of optimism. “Even if this recognition draws more tourists to the village, small weavers like me will continue to get limited orders with very thin margins from shops,” said M Krishna Murthy who has been weaving saris for the past 25 years and has two machines. He added how the trend of duplicate saris — from Maharashtra, Gujarat etc — flooding the market is further denting their business. But not all hope is lost just yet. Some still believe that the newly attained tag will prove to be a blessing bringing new customers who have earlier never heard about Ikat saris. “We are hopeful that more people will come here after hearing about the international tag conferred to Pochampally and our sales will increase,” said Ramesh M, who has been selling Ikat saris, dresses and other items for five years. ‘Want our children to get jobs’Almost all weavers in Pochampally village who TOI met on Wednesday said they will not pass this skill on to their children. Instead, they want them to study and secure a more stable job. “The money earned through hours of weaving is sufficient only for food and clothing. There is no money left even to get our children educated,” said Bala Raju V, who has been weaving for the last seven years. He said he now plans to stop and instead start a grocery store or some other business. Weavers also appealed to the government to provide them with some assistance in return for all laurels their work has brought to the state. They called for subsidies and other benefits that can help them improve their standard of living.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/for-pochampally-weavers-its-still-a-battle-for-survival/articleshow/87767888.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

The Rajkot Information Technology Association (RITA) has moved a proposal to allot six lakh square feet of land for this park on the new ring road. The proposal is expected to get the government nod before the end of the current financial year. The park will be a big shot in the arm for Rajkot’s IT sector which has an annual turnover of Rs 4,000 crore and is growing at almost 30%. The industry had generated tremendous business during the lockdown, insiders informed. RITA has been demanding for the allotment of IT Park for a long time. But RITA officials were not able to move the proposal due to Covid-induced lockdown. Finally, around two months back, a proposal to allot the IT Park to Rajkot was moved to Gujarat informatics limited (GIL), the nodal agency of department of science and technology (DCT) around two months back. Jaydeep Nandani, chairman of RITA, said that all the relevant details have been submitted to the GIL. “Now, the proposal is pending with DCT. We are expecting to have a meeting with the top officials of DCT soon for the final nod,” Nandani said. “We have conducted a survey and our association members have expressed interest in the land around four lakh square metre. Once the Park gets the nod, the IT industry from the entire Saurashtra will move here. So, we have demanded six lakh square feet of land from the government,” Nandani added. RITA officials are around 3,000 units to come up at the park which will generate employment for nearly one lakh people. RITA has demanded a land parcel on the new ring road opposite the smart city of Vajdi Gadh village. The location has around three plots measuring six to eight and sources said that one of it may be allotted for the IT Park. Ronak Raiyani, president of RITA, said that they are in constant touch with government officials. “Looking at the progress, we are expecting the announcement of IT Park in Rajkot in the next three to four months.

---||Hyderabad||Opportunities galore in gaming, VFX industries||Hyderabad: With consumers displaying a growing appetite for high-definition visual experiences, career opportunities in the gaming, animation and VFX industries are rising at a rapid pace, said experts. Gautam Vohra, VP & business head, telecom & engineering staffing, TeamLease Digital, pointed out that cinema buffs, esports enthusiasts as well as gamers are demanding high-quality productions with engaging visual effects and realistic animation, which in turn are pushing studios to include more animation and VFX shots into films and games. “The demand for talent has increased in various jobs that are related to the gaming and VFX industry. In fact, we are seeing a trend of people considering gaming as a serious career option lately, especially in the area of VR and AI.” Vohra pointed out that the common thread running through VFX, gaming and esports is animation due to which the demand for roles such as 2D/3D animation artist and 3D modeller is on rise. “These industries are expected to witness a hiring growth of 18-22% in the coming months and the salary range for starters would be around Rs 3.5 lakh per year, which can go up to Rs 10 lakh per annum based on experience,” he said. Talking about salary trends in the gaming sector at IndiaJoy 2021, Joseph Cairns, founder and CEO of Adventure Recruitment, a hiring firm specialising in the gaming industry, said that the salary for game developers in the mid-senior or lead level would range from Rs 10-30 lakh per annum whereas the package for tech directors could range from Rs 40 lakh to Rs 1 crore per annum. “Designers are in high demand as there is a shortage in India and they would get paid around Rs 8-25 lakh per annum, whereas for design directors salaries are about Rs 20-50 lakh per year. When it comes to artists, there is a big demand but it is one of the less paid areas,” he said. Even Rajiv Chilaka, founder & MD, Green Gold Studios, makers of popular cartoon Chhota Bheem said, “The demand is high for people with drawing skills who can work on storyboards in the animation industry. So, storyboard artists and visual design artists are in high demand.” Chilaka pointed out that the trend of ‘work from home’ triggered by Covid-19 has opened up opportunities for artists from tier 2-3 centres. In fact, his company too has worked with 80 freelance artists last year. Biren Ghose, country head-Technicolor India pointed out that one of the plus points of VFX industry is that many youth, who have dropped out, can be skilled and brought into the mainstream.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/opportunities-galore-in-gaming-vfx-industries/articleshow/87767783.cms||Swati Rathor
---||Nagpur||On BJP leader’s demand, NMC running vax centre in his lawn’s storeroom||Nagpur: On the demand of BJP leader and former corporator Ramesh Chopde, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has been operating a Covid-19 vaccination centre from a storeroom in the marriage lawn owned by, and also named after, the politician at Awasthi Chowk in West Nagpur for last four months. The politician has displayed banners at the entrance announcing ‘free inoculation’, highlighting the BJP party symbol and pictures of himself and other leaders. This display also goes against the code of conduct in place in the district for MLC elections. Chopde is also sending messages in social media groups every morning for last two days. The messages say Covishield is available free of cost at New Chopde Lawns from 11am onwards and open for all. There is no mention about the NMC or government in the messages, though the centre is being operated by the civic body. Right from staff to doses, syringes, nurses, doctor, computers and all other required materials are facilitated by the NMC. There is no board or banner erected by NMC at the vaccination centre. The only banner is that of Chopde. The storeroom is a makeshift tin-shed facility for storing the materials. Huge quantity of materials used for decorating lawns and hosting functions is stored in the room from where the vaccination centre is operating. As per government’s guidelines, there should be a waiting hall, registration area, followed by another room for vaccination and third one for observation for 30 minutes at the centre after vaccination. None of these facilities are available at the centre. Confirming that the vaccination centre cannot be operated from a storeroom, NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI, “I am not aware of such problems at the centre. I will verify and do the needful.” NMC zonal medical officer Ateequr Raheman Khan said, “We used to run the centre at NMC’s school at Pension Nagar. Beneficiaries and staff faced inconvenience due to high temperature during summer. Corporator Archana Pathak (also from BJP) suggested the lawn. Chopde provided a nice hall with all facilities. Later, citing functions, he shifted the centre to another room.” Chopde said, “People were facing problems at earlier location. Therefore, I asked NMC officials to run the centre from my lawn. I am providing space and materials free of cost. Around 20,000 people benefited. I shifted the centre to another room as number of beneficiaries reduced. NMC can shift centre to another place if the wish to.” Congress corporator Nitish Gwalbanshi alleged, “NMC officials opened centre in BJP leader’s lawn to give him publicity. NMC has five schools nearby. Also, there are few halls and campus of police department, CID, passport office etc in the area. Still, the centre is being run in a storeroom. Chopde and other BJP leaders are publicising that they are running the centre free of cost for the people.” Gwalbanshi also said, “It is a major violation of code of conduct. Still, the collector office and police department are turning a blind eye. The lawn, banner highlighting names, symbol and pictures of BJP and its leaders are right on main road and easily visible to all.” Collector R Vimala said she would ask team of model code of conduct to check. The NMC runs vaccination centres from 10am to 5pm. But this centre starts at 11am and closes at 2pm. The storeroom to keep syringes, AEFI kit etc is open the entire day as workers store, bring outside and again keep back the materials. Another major violation is that Rs10 is being recovered to get print out of Covid-19 certificate at the centre. A poster informing about charges is also placed at the gate of the centre. NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said it was wrong if any charges are being recovered. “I will look into it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/on-bjp-leaders-demand-nmc-running-vax-centre-in-his-lawns-storeroom/articleshow/87767127.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Work on the site at Khatamba had started after the state government and BJP decided to ensure that cattle did not stray on city roads. The state government had identified four large tracts of grazing land to relocate the cattle being kept in the city. These were handed over to the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) that was to develop infrastructure there to keep cattle and also make arrangements for cattle herders. Sources in the VMC said that the work on the facility will be spread across one lakh square feet. It will be able to house 2,000 cattle. The facility will allow cattle owners to build their own shades. The VMC will shortly hold meetings with cattle owners in the city and ask them to shift when the facility is ready. After this strict action will be taken if cattle are found on the city roads. Meanwhile, the civic body is also looking to increase the intake capacity of its cattle ponds. The cattle ponds can presently keep around 500 cattle. VMC is looking to increase this to around 750. Sources said that the increase of intake at cattle ponds has been in the pipeline since quite some time now, but the work was not taken up due to Covid-19 and paucity of funds. Funds are now available for the project, sources said. The expansion of the cattle pond to keep impounded cattle will also take place at Khatamba.  It is the only pond where space is available for expansion. Besides the cattle pond, it also has a facility for animal birth control operations of stray dogs. VMC will also be extending the contract of the existing firms that are looking after the upkeep of cattle at three cattle ponds at Lalbaug, Khaswadi and Bhutdi Jhampa. This will be done as the bidding process to identify the new firms is still in process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/new-site-to-house-2000-cattle-impounded-on-roads/articleshow/87766340.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Three months after getting discharged from a hospital, K Gopal, a resident of Keesara developed a peculiar condition and was getting a wheezing sound each time he was breathing in, especially while sleeping.  This condition is generally caused due to cold, asthma, allergies, or more serious conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, most doctors would say, but in Gopal’s case there was something else. He had prolonged coronavirus infection, requiring hospitalisation in an intensive care unit. “When he came to us we carried out further investigations, which revealed that he had tracheal stenosis or narrowing, which required stenting in the region of blockage. The patient was discharged from the hospital and is now leading a normal life without any complication,” Dr Tapaswi Krishna, consultant pulmonologist, Gleneagles Global Hospital in Lakdi-ka-pul said. Experts across Hyderabad said that many recovered Covid-19 patients are developing increase in blood pressure and diabetes levels to obstructions in the respiratory trachea, while some are developing heart ailments. Doctors in both government and corporate sectors are seeing around 10 cases per day in OPD with post-viral hyper reactive airway disease, which presents as asthma with wheezing. “Patients with prolonged endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation support where there is an increased tendency to form tracheal stenosis which is nothing but tracheal narrowing. This is seen a lot more in the second wave as the virulence of the virus is more,” informed Dr R Adityavadan, consultant pulmonologist with SLG hospitals. An expert at the state-run Gandhi Hospital said that increase in hospitalisations and increased severity of the disease has led to prolonged mechanical ventilation and complications. “The treatment is usually more invasive with narrowing of the windpipe, stent placements or surgery,” he added.

Of the six names announced by TRS leadership for council seats, not a single Muslim figures, members of Jamia Nizamia Old Boys Association and Tanzeem-e-Aimma Masajid, Hyderabad said in a media conference. At least two Muslims should be nominated for the Legislative Council so that the trust and confidence reposed by the community in TRS can remain intact, the minority leaders said. They said Muslims account for 18 per cent of population in Telangana but they have a lone representative in the legislative council. “This puts a question mark on the 12 per cent reservations promised...,” said Moulana Sultan Ahmed Naqshbandi. TRS can still accommodate Muslim candidates, said Shabbir Ali and Salmeen bin Sayeed, both local leaders. The last date for finalising names of candidates is November 24.

---||Hyderabad||Best tourism village still lacks roads, hotels||Hyderabad: It might be among the best tourism villages on paper, but in reality, Pochampally is far from that. As TOI toured the village and spoke to locals, it found there are several problems — bad roads and lack of hotels, among other things. Soon after getting off the national highway, one has to travel on a kaccha road for about 11 km to reach Pochampally village. “When one gets to know that a village has been selected as one of the best tourism villages, the least they expect is proper roads to reach the place. I was shocked to see the condition of the road,” said M Raju, a resident of Patancheru who visited Pochampally on Wednesday. He said that the state should immediately repair the roads and take measures to keep monkeys away from the main road. Often referred to as the Silk City of India for the exquisite saris woven through a unique style called Ikat, Pochampally will be given the award by UNWTO on December 2, 2021 in Madrid on the occasion of the 24th session of the UNWTO General Assembly. But even though people visiting the village to buy hand-woven saris, dresses, etc are happy with the quality and price of products, they have one complaint—the non-availability of a decent eatery in the locality. “I heard a lot about Pochampally dresses from my sister-in-law and have come to check out the dresses. I spent more than six hours in the village and was desperately looking for a hotel to eat something. Though I could find an eatery near the police station, the food served there was not good,” said A Alekhya, a resident of Uppal. Apart from Pochampally saris and Telangana tourism park, there are not many attractions in the village. The Vinobha Bhave Mandir, a place where Vinobha Bhave resided during his visit to the village in 1951 and commemorated the Bhoodan Movement, lies in a neglected state. The same is the case with the 101 Darwaja House (a heritage building). Though Ch Vijaya Lakshmi, chairperson, Pochampally village, told TOI that there is a plan to turn the lake opposite Vinobha Bhave Mandir into a mini-tank bund, nothing much has been done on that front so far. There are several temples, including Ayappa Temple, Markandeya Temple, among others, in the village that have potential to attract tourists. “Now that the village is conferred with an international tag, it will undergo a makeover soon — mostly in the next six months. Plans are being drafted to start a boating facility in the lake or mini tank-bund, increase number of guest houses in the tourism park, start a restaurant, and add other embellishments,” said Uppala Srinivas Gupta, chairman, Telangana Tourism adding that a detailed proposal will be sent to chief minister on plans to improve tourism in the village. He added that roads too will be repaired soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/best-tourism-village-still-lacks-roads-hotels/articleshow/87767892.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

The police officials said that the suspects have targeted only the farmers who has received crores as compensation against the acquisition of their lands for the Mumbai-Nagpur Samruddhi super expressway.

Santosh Mane, assistant inspector at Bidkin police station said that based on the complaint by a 30-year-old woman, who is victim famer’s wife, two suspects have been booked on the charges of cheating, criminal breach of trust and criminal intimidation. In addition to this, the sections of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (in financial establishments) Act, 1999 has also been invoked against the duo. API Mane said, as per the complaint, the farmer has been duped by the suspected duo to the tune of Rs 10 lakh, on the pretext of returning him Rs 15 lakh within two months. Under this scheme, the investor farmer had been assured a 30% return per month. The police said that the perpetrators of this scheme have targeted only the farmers who have received large sums in compensation against their lands acquired for Samruddhi super expressway.

---||Delhi||Delhi air pollution: In plans to fight fire with fire, hotspots under focus||NEW DELHI: After the Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and adjoining areas ordered a slew of measures to tackle air pollution, environment minister Gopal Rai on Wednesday said fire tenders would be deployed for sprinkling water at 13 hotspots across the city. The 13 hotspots include Rohini, Dwarka, Okhla Phase-II, Punjabi Bagh, Anand Vihar, Vivek Vihar, Wazirpur, Jahangirpuri, R K Puram, Bawana, Mundka, Narela and Mayapuri. “In addition to the current 372 water tankers operating across Delhi, the fire service’s tenders will be deployed to increase the spraying capacity at the 13 hotspots where the pollution levels are relatively higher,” said Rai. After holding a meeting with different departments, Rai said Delhi government had come up with a 10-point formula to fight pollution at a greater level. The environment department on Wednesday ordered all departments, organisations and corporations to implement the CAQM directions. “The heads of the departments or corporations concerned will closely monitor the whole situation personally on a daily basis and submit an action-taken report every day,” it said. “All Delhi government offices will have 100% work from home. Instructions have been given to police to form a special task force to monitor traffic congestion, curb pollution on the roads and ensure smoother travel. The transport department has provided a list of vehicles older than 10 years running on petrol and 15 years using diesel to Delhi Police to ensure they are kept off the roads,” said the minister. Checking of PUC certificates at petrol pumps would be reinforced to identify and deal with vehicles causing extra pollution. Special teams would act against industries flouting directions and causing pollution. Elaborating on other decisions, Rai said the ban on construction and demolition activities had been extended till November 21. “All schools, colleges, institutes, libraries and training centres will remain closed until further orders. To encourage public transport, 1,000 private CNG buses will be hired. This process will begin on Thursday. We have written to Delhi Disaster Management Authority to issue new directions to enhance the carrying capacity of buses and Delhi Metro trains by permitting standing passengers,” he added. The minister said the “Red Light On, Gaadi Off” campaign had been extended for another 15 days and its second phase would be launched on November 19. Meanwhile, transport minister Kailash Gahlot said that entry of trucks into Delhi, except those carrying essential commodities like raw vegetables, fruits, grains, milk, eggs, etc and tankers carrying petroleum products, was prohibited with immediate effect till November 21 or till further orders. The transport department’s pollution control division issued the order on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-plans-to-fight-fire-with-fire-hotspots-under-focus/articleshow/87767169.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Disha encounter case: Juvenile status of accused not verified, SC panel told||HYDERABAD: Continuing her arguments before the the SCappointed inquiry commission for the second consecutive day, advocate Vasudha Nagaraj has stated that the arrest of the Disha rape and murder case accused was illegal as the arrest memo was not executed in violation of Section 41-B of the CrPC and the juvenile status of three of the accused was not verified by neither police, who arrested them, nor the magistrate, who sent them in judicial remand. Vasudha, who represented independent journalist K Sajaya, referred to the deposition of the then Shadnagar SHO, Sridhar Kumar, before the commission. Sridhar Kumar had arrested the four accused from Jaklair and Gudigandla villages on November 29, 2019. Quoting from the SHO’s deposition, she said, “Sridhar Kumar had answered that he did not remember when he was asked by the commission’s advocate whether he enquired from the accused or their relatives their age?” He made no effort to ascertain the age of the accused. As per the family, the arrest was made between 3am and 5am on November 29, 2019. However, as per the IO, the arrest was made at 5pm on the same day at Shadnagar PS. In his affidavit too, there was no mention of ascertaining the age of the accused at the time of the arrest or of intimating the families. It was also pointed out that no arrest memo or panchnama was executed at the time of the arrest. “We seem to be above Section 41-B (Procedure of arrest and duties of officer making arrest) of the CrPC,” Vasudha stated. The advocate also argued that Farooqnagar tahsildar and executive magistrate J Pandu, who sent the accused in judicial remand, had also not ascertained their age and even additional judicial first class magistrate P Shyam Prasad did not verify the age of the accused, which was a violation of the Juvenile Justice (JJ) Act. While the advocate was referring to the deposition of circle inspector (CI) K Narasimha Reddy about his statement recorded by an NHRC team, commission chairman VS Sirpurkar commented, “The CI practically disowned entire NHRC statement, but he did not mention it in his affidavit when he had a chance and during the deposition before the commission, stated that his advocate said it was not necessary.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/juvenile-status-of-accused-not-verified-sc-panel-told/articleshow/87767164.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Mumbai||CBI questions Maharashtra's plea for SIT on cop postings||MUMBAI: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Wednesday argued that the Maharashtra government’s petition to replace it with a special investigation team (SIT) to probe allegations of deals in police postings and transfers since its former director general of police (DGP) was made director of the agency, is “misconceived” and “utter hypocrisy”. “It is but a guise to not let the investigation continue... and in some ways safeguarding an individual or averting scrutiny,” said Aman Lekhi, additional solicitor general (ASG), in detailed submissions before the Bombay high court to oppose the state’s petition, questioning its “conduct”. The CBI counsel said, “The writ is misconceived... This plea is not even raised by the parties but by the state” which has no right and cannot be entitled to the relief it seeks. The state’s special senior counsel Darius Khambata said the CBI probe is “seeking to demoralize and frighten each policeman”. The state had recently petitioned the HC to seek that a SIT replace CBI probe into an FIR against former home minister Anil Deshmukh and unknown others for allegations of corruption in police postings and transfers and to have a retired judge monitor the probe. The state filed the petition after CBI had issued summons to its chief secretary Sitaram Kunte who was earlier additional CS (home) and state DGP Sanjay Pandey in its probe. Subodh Jaiswal, the current CBI director, was the state DGP from 2019 to December 2020 and headed two police establishment boards that recommend and decide various police postings, Khambata had said, wondering how could the CBI then continue the investigation. Khambata said, “There is nothing that prevents the state from coming to court.” He invoked the principle of ‘parens patriae’ (a doctrine where the state has the standing to bring a suit on behalf of persons legally unable to act), saying every individual policeman cannot be expected to move court. At a hybrid hearing before a bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Sarang Kotwal, Lekhi said, “The state’s invocation of law and claim of interest in fair investigation is an instance of duplicity.” The state government was making a “clear attempt not to proceed with the matter... and deliberately avoiding criminal investigation,” he said, adding, “Responsible parenting means a parent has to pull up a ward...The state as a parent is not supposed to protect a wrongdoer.’’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cbi-questions-state-plea-for-sit-on-cop-postings/articleshow/87768639.cms||Swati Deshpande

We will complete it by extending it up to the Bihar border, creating mandis for the products of farmers of east UP to get the best price and generate employment.” ”People are all set to oust this government having faith in bull and bulldozer,” said Akhilesh, who was accompanied by former MLA Shibgatullah Ansari, the elder brother of jailed mafia don and MLA Mukhtar Ansari, on his home turf where many of his illegally earned properties have been bulldozed by the government in the past one and half years. “On the issue of stray cattle, especially bulls, he said, “Many problems for the farmers have remained unresolved as they faced a crisis of even fertilizers.” “By promising to enable people in ‘hawai chappals’ (slippers) to travel in airplanes, this government compelled them to discard their two-wheelers by raising the prices of petrol and diesel,” he said. He alleged, “The youths kept waiting for government jobs and other employment opportunities in the past five years, but this government did not fulfil its promises. All the sections of the society are ready for bringing a change in power in 2022.” Earlier, the chopper of SP chief, who was accompanied by alliance partner Om Prakash Rajbhar of Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) landed near the beginning point of the expressway at Pakhanpura. Amidst loud cheers and sloganeering by charged supporters, Akhilesh boarded his ‘Vijay Rath’ to begin its fourth phase by covering the area up to Lucknow. As a huge motorcade followed his ‘Vijay Rath’, SP supporters in large numbers welcomed the Yatra at various points, including Harikaranpur of Jungipur assembly area and Barachanvar in Jahurabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/akhileshs-vijay-yatra-rollsonto-purvanchal-expressway/articleshow/87766371.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

In two videos posted on social media platforms, the MP can be seen questioning the bank officials for allegedly forcing the farmers to spend money on health insurance. He can also be heard accusing the bank employees of throwing away a farmer’s loan application as he (the farmer) had refused to purchas the health insurance. Rajenimbalkar told TOI, “The farmers queuing up at the bank for crop loans are being forced to purchase health insurance. I have brought this to the notice of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray as well as our party leadership.” The MP has alleged that the officials of the public sector banks are doing these things to achieve the targets set by their bosses. He even demanded that an independent inquiry to ascertain the number of farmers who were forced to purchase the insurance cover. Vishal Pawar, a farmer from Dharur, too leveled allegations against the bank officials and said that he was poorly treated for refusing to buy the health insurance. He said his file was thrown at his father’s face. The allegations, however, have been refuted by the bank officials. They said no farmer was forced to buy the health insurance. When contacted, SBI branch deputy manager Vijaykumar Kamble said: “We never forced any farmer to purchase ‘Arogya Plus’ health insurance, which covers the insured person, the spouse and two children for up to Rs 3 lakh. In addition, the insurance also provides a cover of Rs 3 lakh in case of death.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/mp-pulls-up-bank-staff-for-forcing-farmers-to-buy-health-insurance/articleshow/87764768.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Overall, 108 such visitors have been prohibited from entering the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) so far since November 12, revealed the official data. “Four squads have been formed to check vaccination certificates of visitors before entering the AMC headquarters. Visitors who have not undergone vaccination have been asked to get immunised against Covid-19 first and then seek entry,” said an official release. Notably, the civic administration had earlier made Covid testing mandatory for visiting AMC premises, which saw large-scale screening of the visitors during the second wave of the pandemic. Located near the Town Hall within old city limits, the local civic body receives a large number of visitors every day. The civic authorities have already set November 30 as the deadline for getting at least one dose of Covid vaccine, failing which, curbs will be imposed on the sale of fuel and inter-district travel. Meanwhile, the ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ Covid-19 inoculation campaign to increase vaccination coverage has covered 61,780 homes within the municipal limits of Aurangabad so far. On Wednesday, the campaign reached out to 9,631 homes and identified 3,890 female and 3,633 male beneficiaries who were yet to take the first dose of the vaccine. There were also 3,539 people whose second dose is overdue. “Citizens who are yet to get immunized have been counselled and convinced to undergo vaccination,” Dr Paras Mandhlecha, the health officer of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/108-unvaccinated-visitors-denied-entry-into-amc-premises/articleshow/87765526.cms||---

As per the data, the percentage of children with at least one smartphone increased from 42.3% in 2018 to 85.5% in 2021. But, of the 85.5% of children, only 27% said that they had access to a smartphone every time they wanted to study. The remaining 62.7% reported that they got access sometimes while the remaining 10.3% said that they never got the smartphone to study. Somraj Giradkar, Maharashtra state head for Pratham that prepares the ASER report, said, “A rough estimate here is that one out of ten children purchased smartphones during the lockdown. In most households, if there is only one phone, it is with the father. Hence, the maximum students (62.7%) have fallen in the category which gets access sometimes. The 27% of children that always have access comprises mostly older children. Parents feel they cannot entrust young children with a cellphone of their own. However, compared to the national average, Maharashtra is doing well.” National statistics show that only 67.6% of students have at least one smartphone in their home of which 26.1% of students have no access to it for their studies. The survey covered 990 villages in 33 districts of the state covering 4,242 households with 4,023 children. A total of 70.4% of parents supported their wards while studying which is also coupled with the fact that study material availability among children has increased from 80.8% last year to 89.8% this year. Mahendra Ganpule, state spokesperson of Maharashtra Headmasters’ Association said that more parents have got involved with their ward’s education during the lockdown than was previously observed. “During the lockdown, many school-related activities required parental guidance. Hence, even if the parents were illiterate or school dropouts, they still were helping students with the activities or at least making them do their work which was previously taken as solely the teacher’s job. Secondly, many parents in the rural areas or low-income groups saw wage cuts but they still saved money for internet recharges and such just so that their children could study. Some even cut down on their other expenses to make this happen. Hence, the role of parents during the lockdown in rural areas is commendable. This was also helped by the timely distribution of books and other learning materials both online and offline by the state,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/more-smartphones-in-hand-but-access-elusive-for-pupils/articleshow/87767176.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Late at night, family members of Altaf Bhat were detained near Press Enclave in Srinagar by the police. Earlier in the day, kin of Altaf and another civilian Mudassir Gul, who was also killed in the encounter, held a daylong protest. PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti, who held a protest in Jammu in the morning and returned to Srinagar around 3 pm, was not allowed to go near Press Enclave by the authorities. Around midnight, Mehbooba tweeted from her official Twitter handle: “Instead of handing over mortal remains of the innocent civilians, police has arrested the family members for demanding the bodies of their loved ones. Unbelievably ruthless & insensitive. Least they can do is return the mortal remains immediately.” Earlier in the day, NC president and MP Farooq Abdullah telephoned J&K lieutenant-governor Manoj Sinha and demanded an impartial and time-bound inquiry into the encounter and the return of the bodies of the slain civilians to their kin.

---||Delhi||How Delhi govt is going extra mile to hire private buses for air emergency||NEW DELHI: The Delhi government is going the extra mile to ensure around 1,000 private buses are deployed to augment the city’s public transport fleet. After transport minister Kailash Gahlot said on Tuesday that the government would hire around 1,000 private buses, the transport department held a meeting with associations of all-India tourist permit, contract carriage and school bus owners and has promised to be flexible to accommodate their demands. Gahlot told TOI on Tuesday that this was being done as an emergency measure and the government was trying to engage 1,000 private buses, though during the implementation of the odd-even scheme in previous years, only around 650 buses could be arranged. During the first edition of the odd-even scheme in January 2016, around 2,900 private buses were deployed on Delhi’s streets under Paryavaran Sewa. At that time, schools were closed and that is why a large number of buses were available. During the second edition in April the same year, only 500 buses were available as school buses couldn’t be used. Shyam Lal Gola, president of All India Luxury Bus Union who attended the meeting on Tuesday, said the operators had agreed to provide buses as long as their genuine demands were met. “The prices of CNG have gone up and the rate per kilometre provided to us should reflect it to make the move viable for us. Also, we have demanded that the payments should be timely.” Gola added that the operators had demanded that the rates should be enough to cover a full day’s salary for the driver, even if the bus was not hired for the entire day as the overhead costs, including maintenance, remained the same. “The validity of documents like fitness certificates, permits etc are ending on November 30 and we have requested that these should be extended up to December 31. Since our buses would be deployed for a month, it would be difficult to get the documents renewed,” he said. “The government has agreed to almost all the demands and has assured that we would face no problem,” Gola added. Ashish Kundra, principal secretary-cum-transport commissioner, told TOI that the associations were receptive and though most had only 50 to 100 buses, they would add up to around 1,000. He said the department and Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) would be flexible with arrangements, such as allowing school buses after school hours, if needed. DTC is also chalking out the routes on which these vehicles will be deployed. The buses will have DTC’s signage and conductors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-delhi-govt-is-going-extra-mile-to-hire-private-buses-for-air-emergency/articleshow/87767184.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Delhi||Court upholds jail term for man over Diwali negligence||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has upheld an order by which a man was sentenced to a six-month jail term for negligently lighting a firecracker on Diwali in 2013, which hit a person’s eye and caused loss of his eyesight.  Additional Sessions Judge Pooran Chand noted that the injuries suffered by the complainant in his right eye were grievous in nature. A magistrate court had convicted and sentenced Naveen to six months in prison for the offences punishable under sections 286 (negligent conduct with respect to explosive substance) and 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the IPC. He was also directed to pay a compensation of Rs 60,000 to the complainant. As per the prosecution, on November 3, 2013, the complainant was standing outside and four-five houses ahead of his house, Naveen, in a rash and negligent manner, lit a Diwali rocket and kicked the bottle, as a result of which the rocket suddenly hit the complainant in his right eye. This injury caused permanent privation of the sight of right eye of the complainant. Initially, the complainant did not realise that it was a serious injury and hence did not file any complaint. However, later on, when the problem in his right eye aggravated, he filed the complaint on November 9, 2013. On his complaint, an FIR was registered and the accused was arrested. Naveen had challenged the magistrate court’s order, saying there was a delay of six days in registration of FIR and there were major contradictions in the testimony of the complainant and the IO. Regarding the delay in registration of FIR, the sessions court said in its order on November 16, that the complainant in his testimony has given a very reasonable explanation regarding the delay in registration of FIR, which is that he had not reported the matter as he had thought that it was just a simple injury, but it was not so later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-upholds-jail-term-for-man-over-diwali-negligence/articleshow/87768039.cms||---

---||Agra||Second time in 5 months, dead fish wash up on Yamuna shores in Agra||AGRA: Hundreds of dead fish once again washed ashore on the banks of Yamuna river, near Rambagh ghat in Agra, on Tuesday, possibly due to discharge of “highly polluted” industrial waste into the river between Mathura and Agra. This is the second such incident in the past five months. Though UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) officials claimed that the dissolved oxygen (DO) levels in the water were more than the permissible limits required for aquatic life, sources said that release of recycled waste water into river after treatment of Yamuna water with high content of chlorine could have been the cause of the death of fish. Besides, non-functional sewage treatment plants in the city could also have contributed to the incident. UPPCB regional officer Vishwanath Sharma said that the report of water samples taken from three different locations after the incident — Kailash ghat (upstream), water works and Dussehra ghat (down-stream) — were found adequate for aquatic life. “The DO level was 7.5mg/l at Kailash ghat, 6 at water works and 4.5 at Dussehra ghat,” he said, adding that aquatic animals require a DO of 4.5 or more. However, a biological oxygen demand (BOD) report is still awaited. Citing the reasons for the dead fish, Sharma said that when the flow of water at Gokul barrage in Mathura was resumed after being stopped for a certain period, mud at the bottom of the river dissolved in the water had depleted the oxygen levels, adversely affecting the aquatic life. However, Gokul barrage officials in Mathura refuted this claim and said that if this was true, then some fish should have also washed ashore there, too. Sources meanwhile told TOI that the sewage treatment plants at points where the Yamuna water enters Agra — Budi ka Nagla and Jaganpur — have been non-functional. Sewage pumping stations in Manoharpura, Balkeshwar, Rajwaha and Naraich are also not working properly, a source added. Four months back, on July 22, shoals of dead fish had washed ashore on the banks of the Yamuna in Agra. Environmentalists in Agra had then said that it is a matter of grave concern and authorities should take it seriously.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/second-time-in-5-months-dead-fish-wash-up-on-yamuna-shores-in-agra/articleshow/87766377.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Nagpur||Around 50% of 12 metre or wider roads in city still have potholes||Nagpur: Around 50% of 12-metre-wide and above roads in the city are in bad condition and full of potholes. The city has around 113 tar roads which are 12-metre-wide or above. Of them, 56 roads are in bad shape, according to a report compiled by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s public works department. Highest number of bad tar roads are situated under Lakadganj zone where 11 out of 9 roads are in bad condition and roads in Hanuman Nagar area are in the best condition with just one out of 11 are bad shape. The hotmix department claimed to have carried out patchwork on most of the roads in Lakadganj zone. In Gandhibagh zone, there are around 15 tar roads of 12-metre-wide or above. The department have repaired seven but nine roads are still in bad condition. In Mangalwari zone too eight of 10 roads are in bad condition. Though the department has carried out patchwork in almost all stretches but five are in worst condition and need complete renovation. Under Dharampeth zone, of the 27 different stretches, six roads are in worst condition. Sources in the NMC blamed the elected representatives for the worsening condition of roads in the city. “They only concentrate and ensure pothole-free roads in residential areas, while the major thoroughfares remain negligected,” sources said. A senior official from the NMC’s PWD said that the civic body has taken up the job of repairing potholes on war-footing basis. “Besides, this we have shortlisted 14 roads which will be renewed completely,” he said, while there are proposals to convert four tar roads into cement concretization. Similarly, Nagpur Improvement Trust and state’s public works department too will either renew the existing tar roads or may convert them into cement roads, the official said. The code of conduct imposed for MLC election has also affected the renewal of several roads in the city. The tender invitation process of many roads got stalled due to the model code of conduct came into force, admitted the official. To a query, the official said that in anticipation of the MLC polls, the NMC had completed the tender process of renovation of Civil Lines roads. Even the work is under progress, the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/around-50-of-12-metre-or-wider-roads-in-city-still-have-potholes/articleshow/87767204.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Widows of three manual scavengers to get Rs 26 lakh||MUMBAI: Following a Bombay high court order two months back, Maharashtra government on November 16 approved a one-time special compensation of over Rs 26 lakh to heirs of three manual scavengers who died while descending into a contaminated sewer in Govandi in December 2019.  The HC had on September 17 directed the district collector to pay Rs 10 lakh compensation to each within four weeks after terming the case as “eye-opening”. The workers died while cleaning a septic tank at Morya Housing Society. Isha Singh, counsel for the widows who approached the HC for compensation, argued that even though the deaths took place consequent to a housing society employing individuals as manual scavengers, the state had to compensate them. She said the state had a duty to eradicate manual scavenging under Article 17 of the Constitution (abolition of untouchability), hence the compensation be paid by the state for their loss. Government pleader Poornima Kantharia had said the state was willing to rehabilitate Bani Debnath, Neeta Kalshekar and Vimla Chorotiya by providing their children scholarships. A bench of Justices Ujjal Bhuyan and Madhav Jamdar had directed the compensation gave the state liberty to recover the amount from private employers. Last week the widows informed the HC that the state was yet to comply. The State sought time and attracted a wry observation from the holiday bench headed by Justice S J Kathawalla “red tapism is the cause of all problems''. The State then assured it would be done by November 18. The State government resolution (GR) on Tuesday to ensure the payment said the amount os Rs 26.5 lakh –Rs 8.75 lakh each to the three families--be made available immediately to the Collector, Mumbai Suburbs, and said it is necessary to recover the private builder. The State had paid Rs 1.25 lakh each earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-widows-of-3-manual-scavengers-to-get-rs-26l/articleshow/87768648.cms||Swati Deshpande

Bids for this consultancy have been called and the consultants will be studying consumption of electricity on civic properties as well as at public places. They will suggest measures to reduce usage of power por streetlights, waterworks, pumping stations, sewage treatment plants and in municipal buildings. If electricity gets saved, the advisers will be paid. The proposal states that after the merger of 11 villages in 2017 and 23 villages in July 2021, all PMC departments will spend more, including the electricity department. Streetlights and other civic facilities in the villages will also be controlled and operated by PMC. So, it has been mooted that a detailed project report (DPR) will be prepared by the agency, providing data on how money and power can be saved, and what new technology can be used. The firm will have to shoulder responsibility of expenses, and information about payback period must be shared in the DPR. PMC spends Rs138.6 crore per year on power bills. Nearly 10% savings are expected from the project, amounting to Rs13.8 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pvt-firms-will-guide-pmc-to-save-power/articleshow/87767211.cms||---

This, even after the TDB reduced the auction rate by up to 50%. Among the stalls sold out in the auction on Wednesday, there were only two-three hotels, said V Krishnakumara Warrier, executive officer. The rest included toilets, fruits stalls etc. He also said that the auction for the remaining stalls will be held soon after filing a report on the Wednesday’s auction before TDB. He added that in the auctions held previously, up to around 70 stalls were auctioned. The stalls put on auction are along the route from Nilackal-Pampa-Sannidhanam. TDB president K Anandagopan had said on Tuesday that the auction rates cannot be reduced steeply as demanded by bidders who cite Covid-19 or floods. The rates can be reduced slightly, but it will affect other operations here, he had said. But the TDB has found itself in a crisis with fewer number of bidders turning up for the auction of the stalls even after reducing the rates. Spot booking for Sabarimala darshan is scheduled to begin on Thursday. The facilities for booking have been arranged in 10 idathavalams (halting places). Those pilgrims who had not booked through virtual queue system in advance could make use of the spot booking system.

The dairy has a daily collection of 15.5 lakh litre of milk and supplies the same to Mumbai and Pune. The dairy used to get complaints of milk adulteration, especially from Mumbai. This posed challenges before the dairy that is planning to ramp up supply to the state capital. According to the daily authorities, the most common way of adulteration is piercing the pouch with a syringe and drawing the milk out. The pouch is then filled with the water. According to the authorities, hundreds of litres of milk were being adulterated. Vishwas Patil, the chairman of the dairy, said, “With the new packaging, if the pouch is pierced, a blue colour present in one of the layers will spread automatically. It will impart a dark colour to the pouch which, will be a sign for customers that the milk is adulterated. Right now, the new packaging will be used for the milk sold in Mumbai. Slowly it will be used for other places as well.” The new packaging is manufactured in the dairy’s Mumbai-based plant. The dairy sells around 12 lakh litres of milk in Mumbai. Patil said the dairy will gradually increase collection to 20 lakh litres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/gokul-introduces-5-layer-milk-pouches/articleshow/87764814.cms||---

---||Delhi||Don’t have PUC? A visit to petrol pump in Delhi could set you back by Rs 10,000||NEW DELHI: If you don’t have a valid Pollution Under Control Certificate (PUCC) for your vehicle, visiting a petrol pump will likely set you back by Rs 10,000. As part of its initiative to reduce vehicular pollution, Delhi government is deploying officials at filling stations to prosecute vehicles without PUCC. “The enforcement drive against polluting vehicles, which are either visibly polluting or don’t have a valid PUC Certificate, have been going on aggressively for nearly two months,” transport minister Kailash Gahlot told TOI. He added that the number of vehicles getting checked for pollution has gone up drastically in the last couple of months due to the stringent measure. “We have now gone a step ahead and deployed our teams at petrol pumps, where it wouldn’t be possible to refuel a vehicle without a PUCC. We have been advising vehicle owners to get PUC checks done for a long time,” Gahlot said. Civil Defence volunteers will also be deployed at filling stations to help pollution control officers. Mobile teams of the transport department’s enforcement wing would also be present at many places. “We have also deployed Civil Defence volunteers to assist the enforcement officials. Only the officials would issue the fine,” he said. On Tuesday, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) directions regarding vehicular pollution included that plying of visibly polluting vehicles and vehicles without PUC in NCR needs to be stopped. “Checks for PUC may be primarily carried out at the petrol pumps, to obviate congestion on free roads,” the directions stated. Transport department officials said that all 60 teams of the enforcement wing would be deployed at different locations every day and would aggressively carry out a drive against visibly polluting vehicles and vehicles without PUCC. “Apart from major intersections and other locations, teams would be deployed at petrol pumps too,” an official said. “While regular checks on polluting vehicles are carried out throughout the year, special drives happen during the winter months,” he said. The transport department had started gearing for the winter season from September itself to try and keep polluting vehicles off the roads of Delhi. The department has been issuing regular public notices to create awareness about the need to get pollution checks done, apart from reaching out to owners of vehicles with expired PUCC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dont-have-puc-a-visit-to-petrol-pump-could-set-you-back-by-rs-10000/articleshow/87767237.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Delhi||Delhi: Mercury under 10 degrees Celsius for the first time this season||NEW DELHI: The city recorded the lowest minimum temperature of the season at 9.6 degrees Celsius, three degrees below normal, at base station Safdarjung on Wednesday. The night temperature dropped below 10 degrees Celsius at three other stations too — Ayanagar (9.1 degrees Celsius), Lodhi Road (9.8) and Mungeshpur (9.4). A Met official said that since the wind direction was predicted to change to easterly, the minimum temperature was likely to rise marginally over the next three days. However, isolated cold wave conditions were seen in Delhi on Wednesday as cold wave was reported at Ayanagar, where the night temperature dipped five degrees below normal. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), the criteria for a cold wave is that the minimum temperature should be 4 or more degrees below normal or when the minimum temperature is less than 4 degrees Celsius. IMD data shows that the lowest minimum temperature recorded in November last year was 6.3 degrees Celsius. In 2019, the lowest minimum temperature was reported on November 20 at 11.4 degrees Celsius. IMD’s forecast says the minimum temperature is likely to hover around 11-12 degrees Celsius for the next few days. R K Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD, said, “A western disturbance is likely to impact Jammu and Kashmir on November 19-20 and under its influence, the easterly winds are expected to set in, causing rise in minimum temperature. As partial rain is expected over Rajasthan, it is likely to cause cloudiness over Delhi on November 19 night. Easterly winds are expected to add more moisture.” Though northeasterly or easterly winds blew for a few hours during the day, Met officials said more consolidated easterly winds were expected over the city on November 19. “As northwesterly winds are likely to return on November 21, the minimum temperature may again start dipping,” said Jenamani. He added that as relative strong winds were likely on November 21, it would help in cleaning Delhi’s air, causing dispersion of pollutants. According to IMD, the visibility improved on Wednesday as it was in the range of 1,500-2,100 metres at both Safdarjung and Palam, while it was below 1,200 metres two days ago. Mahesh Palawat of Skymet Weather, a private weather forecasting agency, said, “The night temperature dipped on Wednesday due to northwesterly winds, which are cold and dry, while easterly winds are warm and humid.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mercury-under-10c-for-the-first-time-this-season/articleshow/87767231.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Despite four patients dying in a major fire on April 12, and lack of various permissions and safety systems, the private hospital had resumed operations within a month. TOI had on November 13 highlighted the violations and inaction from CS even though Wadi Municipal Council had sent a letter asking to shut down the hospital. Paturkar told TOI, “I received detailed information from Wadi Municipal Council about violations at the hospital. I issued notice directing the hospital to stop medical practice with immediate effect a couple of days ago.” Asked about validity of permission given by him, Paturkar said, “Hospital did not comply with all permissions and safety measures required for operation. Therefore, I did not renew the registration a single time in my tenure.” An official from the office of CS said registration of the hospital lapsed on April 1, and is yet to be renewed. Paturkar also said his office sent a copy of notice issued to the hospital to concerned authorities for action. “Now it is the responsibility of concerned authorities to ensure closure of the hospital, as we did whatever is required from our side,” he said. On Wednesday, the hospital was still operational. Dr Rahul Thawre from the hospital said, “We did not receive any notice from CS directing to close down the hospital. I am out of city so will have to verify. We have not done any violations, so any question of action does not arise at all. Everything is in place at the hospital.” The hospital is operating on the second, third and fourth floor of a commercial building — Pooja Chambers. There are commercial shops on ground and first floor. As per notices of Wadi Municipal Council, the building lacks building plan sanction and fire NOC. Also, the building does not have parking. The hospital has placed oxygen cylinders in side margin of the building with oxygen supply system. Combustible materials are stored on staircase and generators operate below the staircase. The building also lacks a second staircase. Wadi police had booked Thawre in the death of four patients in the fire.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cs-directs-closure-of-well-treat-hospital-lacking-permissions-safety-systems/articleshow/87767232.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

As a part of the Congress’s ongoing campaign ‘Ladki hoon, lad sakti hoon’ slogan, Priyanka men women from all strata of the society, mainly for low-income groups, who listened attentively to the Congress leader’s programmes for women empowerment.  Interacting on a specially built stage over a boat, Priyanka sat with the women, who were mainly Anganwadi workers, ASHA workers, lawyers and members of self-help groups, and discussed their problems at home and at work. “Since ages women have to fight for their rights and have been suppressed. If you want your due right, then you will have to fight for it as you represent half of the population. Therefore, our party has thought of giving tickets to 40% women in the upcoming state elections because only a woman can understand the feelings of another woman and raise their problems in a proper manner,” said Priyanka, promising to give smart phones to girls if the party came to power in the state. She also announced that if Congress comes to power, the widow pension will be increased to Rs 1,000 and Aganwadi workers will be given a stipend of Rs 10,000 apart from scootys to those girl students who have to travel long distances for studies. She further said that the Congress has decided to open 75 schools on the lines of Kendriya Vidyalayas which will be only for girls in which it will be ensured that knowledge for skilled work is also imparted other than regular studies. She assured them that the party would stand by them and help them in every possible way to solve their problems. Recalling her visit to Lalitpur a few days ago, Priyanka said that farmers are dying while standing for hours in queues for procuring fertilisers. Moreover, the greatest problem for women is running their house with the skyrocketing price of LPG cylinders and edible oil. “The entire region is reeling under a water crisis with a number of families lining up in a single tap. It is so sad that buses are being lined up for ferrying people to attend the rally of the PM in Jhansi on November 19 while no bus was provided to the labourers during Covid-19 crisis,” she alleged. The Congress leader also offered prayers at the Matha Gajendranath Shiv temple and Kamatanath temple.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/fight-for-your-rights-priyankaexhorts-women-in-chitrakoot/articleshow/87766425.cms||---

---||Kolhapur||Both camps draw up plans to win Kolhapur MLC election||CLEARED SKHER Kolhapur: The action for the MLC election for Kolhapur local body constituency has started heating up as the candidates of the two major fronts — one led by Congress and the other by Bharatiya Janata Party — are finalised. Sitting MLC Satej Patil will be Congress candidate and former MLA Amal Mahadik will be BJP’s nominee. Since the election is going to be held by secret ballot voting, the candidates are being extra cautious. There are 416 members of local bodies, who are electors in this election. Satej had recently claimed that he has support of 253 electors, which more than sufficient number to win the election easily. Satej has deployed a team of close confidantes to win support from each local body. Sharangdhar Deshmukh, Congress leader and former corporator, said, “The teams are in touch with the electors. We have entrusted them with the task of developing bonding with the electors.” Mahadik team’s strategy is to meet electors individually. Also, they are trying to meet the leaders of the electors. For instance, the Mahadik camp claims that they have support of MLAs Vinay Kore and Prakash Awade, who have their supporters as members of local bodies. However, according to political experts, taking leaders on board does not make major difference since it is simply hard to know who has voted for whom. Political commentator Gurubal Mali said, “Getting leaders on board does not always work for the candidates. Many times, the electors think rationally. Sometimes personal bonding also works. The politics of taking electors to resorts till voting day works only if the electors have their allegiance with a party or a candidate.” The voting for the MLC election is on December 10. The candidates have a little more than three weeks to get the numbers on their side. The election is crucial for Satej Patil, if he wins, it will put a stamp on his leadership across the district and if Mahadik wins, then it would be a resurgence of the Mahadik group, which has faced successive electoral defeats since 2015 MLC election.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/both-camps-draw-up-plans-to-win-kolhapur-mlc-election/articleshow/87764827.cms||---

In his petition, he stated that the policy note of the HR and CE department for the year 2020-21, states that 34,102 temples in the state have an annual income of less than Rs 10,000. This is a matter of great concern. He stated that the present circumstances surrounding the temples may not be to the expected standards. It is necessary that the temples are maintained properly so that the spiritual process and the rituals are performed for the people to experience the purpose for which the temples were consecrated. He stated that an external audit of the nearly 44,000 temples was required to find out the status of temple structures, lands, immovable assets, possession and occupation of the temple properties, the rents received and the dues. That apart, status of other assets like temple chariots, form of rituals and spiritual practices associated with the individual temples, funds being received from the people and the fees and the state of these funds is also required to be ascertained. The external audit should be conducted by setting up a commission of eminent people. A division bench of justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P Velmurugan sought a response from the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/sadhguru-seeks-audit-of-hrce-temples/articleshow/87767225.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Maintain Covid testing momentum even if cases turn nil, local authorities told||PUNE: Local authorities have been directed to maintain the Covid testing momentum in areas with zero weekly positivity or that below the state average of 1.35% to keep the infection spread at its lowest. Last week, Gondia and Nandurbar registered zero positivity rates, while 22 other districts across the state recorded below 100 cases. “The number of active cases has been in the range of 800-1,000 over the last fortnight. Many districts need to scale up testing too,” a state health department official said. During the Diwali week, the weekly testing numbers had halved to about 5.5 lakh as against a normal of 10-11 lakh tests. State task force members said even as the numbers were going down, it was necessary for these districts to prevent any new cases. “While cases are down, there should be no laxity in testing. There is a need to scale up testing in all these districts,” task force member Dr Rahul Pandit said. Dharavi, one of the largest slums in Asia, has seen 37 days of zero infections since the second wave. However, that does not mean that such pockets should be ignored. “Continuous testing is the only way to avoid any sudden rise in cases,” a health official from Mumbai said. In the cabinet note last week, nearly 22 districts registered less than 100 active cases, with the lowest numbers being recorded from Nandurbar and Washim. However, it was found that the weekly testing in these districts too has become dismal. “In the Diwali week, the weekly testing was less than 500 for Nandurbar and it was just 528 for Washim. Nearly seven districts registered weekly testing below 1,000,” another health official said. Public health expert and former state health director Dr PP Doke told TOI that the state was at a very crucial phase as there were hardly any case rise despite restrictions being lifted during the Diwali period. “Two incubation periods (pre- and post-Diwali) have not shown a large variation and if there is no rise in cases in the coming weeks, we can safely state that Maharashtra has reached low endemic phase,” he said. Dr Doke, however, cautioned against letting the guard down and said people should continue following the Covid protocols and scale up testing as well as vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maintain-testing-momentum-even-if-cases-turn-nil-local-authorities-told/articleshow/87767228.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Delhi||Delhi: EDMC sprays insecticides using drones to curb mosquito menace||NEW DELHI: To control mosquito breeding on the banks of Yamuna, East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has started spraying insecticides using a drone. According to an official, as water levels recede post-monsoon, mosquito breeding increases near the river bank. Measures to control breeding in the border areas have also been intensified. “We have started spraying anti-larval medicine by a drone at spots that municipal employees can't access. Drones were used on a pilot basis for spraying anti-larva spray on the banks of river Yamuna and behind Yamuna Bank Metro Station. Chances of mosquito breeding are high in these locations,” said EDMC mayor Shyam Sundar Agarwal. “The civic body has hired only one drone for now, but if its results are good, then more drones will be hired under the anti-dengue program in the future,” said EDMC standing committee chairman Beer Singh Panwar. Each drone can carry 10-12 litres of anti-larva spray in containers fitted with the drone and cover a distance of three kilometres at a time, said an official. The civic bodies had used the drone to spray disinfectant at narrow lanes during the Covid pandemic in early 2020. The initiative aimed to cover a larger area in one day and minimise the chances of spreading infection in public spaces. The civic agencies have reported nine deaths and 5,277 cases due to dengue in the city till November 13. The numbers of cases are higher than the total cases reported till December end in the entire city since 2016. In 2016 dengue cases reported were 4,431; in 2017, it was 4,726, 2,798 reported in 2019 and 2,036 in 2019. In 2020, 1,072 total cases were reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-sprays-insecticides-using-drones-to-curb-mosquito-menace/articleshow/87767249.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana farmers at their wit’s end over alternative crop plan for paddy||HYDERABAD: Farmers in the state are at their wits’ end because the sowing season for alternate crops has already passed. The agriculture department devised a plan in which farmers are encouraged to cultivate sunflower, groundnut and red gram as alternative crops. Surprisingly, only 600 acres was under paddy, with the rest planted in food crops such as maize. Nagarkurnool district had the distinction of most farmland brought under cultivation (1.49 lakh acres). Farmers who want to cultivate other crops, on the other hand, are concerned because the sowing season for those crops is over. “We are also concerned that if we plant crops like groundnut, we will lose money because the price will not be viable,” KR Ramesh Reddy, a farmer, explained. In the last few days, the agriculture department has been distributing brochures on alternate crops. However, there was no clarification on how to shift to other crops in case of land parcels that have been under paddy cultivation for more than four to five years. The government has already divided districts into two categories based on the number of acres where paddy was planted in the previous season. The average paddy extent in the summer season was around 31 lakh acres, but this has already gone up to 60 lakh acres in the last season. All districts having more than 2 lakh acres have been designated as paddy priority districts where alternate crops must be grown. Suryapet had the highest paddy acreage at 4.50 lakh acres, followed by Nalgonda (4.56 lakh acres), Nizamabad (3.91 lakh acres), Siddipet (3.13 lakh acres), Khammam (2.95 lakh acres), Karimnagar (2.92 lakh acres), Kamareddy (2.76 lakh acres), Yadadri Bhuvnagiri (2.72 lakh acres), Medak (2.55 lakh acres) and Mahabubabad (2.13 lakh acres).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/farmers-at-their-wits-end-over-alternative-crop-plan-for-paddy/articleshow/87767223.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Local residents and commuters have said civic authorities and Metro officials should undertake cleaning drives and conduct checks to ensure Metro medians are not turned into waste dumping sites. Garbage and debris have been dumped at medians which are part of the Metro line along Karve Road, Paud Road and the area below a viaduct near the Vanaz depot. Jai Joshi, who regularly travels on Karve Road and Paud Road, said garbage dumping at Metro medians is rampant. “If not maintained properly, these medians may become garbage dumping spots,” Joshi said. The Metro viaduct passes through the middle of roads with medians below. Metro officials have planned to fill the medians with soil and plant trees. Ashutosh Rasne, who travels frequently on Paud Road, said that since the viaduct is ready and work is nearly complete, there should be focus on maintaining the infrastructure, “Dumping of garbage is one among many challenges MahaMetro and the municipal corporation will have to tackle. There will be encroachments and illegal use of space too. Authorities should deal with these issues promptly,” Rasne said. Ajay Shah, who owns a shop on Paud Road, said the municipal corporation should take the initiative in maintenance as the roads belong to the civic administration. “The responsibility of maintenance and cleaning should be assigned in advance,” he added. Hemant Sonawane, general manager (PR) at MahaMetro, said, “We will be jointly working with the civic body to clean garbage and will also come up with a plan for tree plantation and beautification.” Sonawane said the medians will be developed along the lines of traffic islands. The plan has not been taken up yet as Metro work is still under way at many stretches. “But we will come up with a plan with the PMC,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/garbage-debris-litter-medians-along-metro-residents-seek-action/articleshow/87767250.cms||Sarang Dastane

The warning was issued in the wake of communal violence in Tripura. The cell has also instructed social media platforms to remove 36 offensive posts after the Tripura violence. The state cyber cell, which monitors social media platforms, found that at least 25 such objectionable posts were found on Twitter, six on Facebook and five on Instagram. The misinformation was posted between November 12 and 15 which could have posed a law and order problem, said the cyber police. The cyber police said that the social media platforms concerned have deleted some posts while others are expected to be removed soon. Some posts shared videos and photos of violence, which could have hurt the sentiments of a community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/tripura-riots-36-offensive-social-media-posts-detected-in-mumbai/articleshow/87768391.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Decks cleared for Nagpur Flying Club’s take off after DGCA approval||Nagpur: After prodding from the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court, the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has cleared decks for restarting the Nagpur Flying Club (NFC) after a gap of over four and half years. The apex body granted a ‘certificate of approval’ to the British-era club for two years from Tuesday till November 15, 2023. With this mandatory approval, the Maharashtra government run club can now admit students for training and award them Private Pilot License (PPL) and Commercial Private License (CPL) required for flying aircraft in India. TOI had been tracking the NFC’s development through a series of articles, ever since it was closed. “The certification means we can officially restart our operations. We can also purchase new planes and demand funds from the government for the purpose. The Mahajyoti had already granted us Rs2.5 crore funds for training OBC students here. We would soon be approaching the government tribal department to offer similar funds for training tribal students,” an elated divisional commissioner Parajakta Lavangare Varma, the ex-officio chairman, told TOI. She said she was also keen to take help from alumni in running the prestigious club that was once pride of the city and had churned out several pilots, some even served in the Indian Air Force (IAF), while others flew commercial planes in India as well as abroad. NFC’s maintenance cum accountable manager Pragnesh Sisodia said they would soon float an advertisement inviting applications from the aspirants. “The DGCA had already awarded air-worthiness certificates to our four aircraft. We would be initially admitting a batch of 40 students and then expand their number subsequently, once we commence our operations in a full-fledged mode. They would be selected through written-cum-verbal test. We have already appointed assistant flying instructors and other ground staff for running the club’s operations and training students.” The HC has a major role to play in its reopening as it had directed all concerned authorities to make efforts to restart the club. A PIL (No13/2016) was filed by late Flt Lt Shridhar Ghatate through counsel Shriniwas Deshpande and then pursued by his wife Sumedha, after the British-era club stopped operating on account of the government’s apathy. Since 2003, Deshpande, who is himself an NFC alumni, has been fighting for its revival without charging a penny. The HC had even asked the government to grant Rs1 lakh to Deshpande towards the cost of litigation for single-handedly pursuing the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/decks-cleared-for-nagpur-flying-clubs-take-off-after-dgca-approval/articleshow/87767263.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Kanpur||Minister expresses displeasure over construction of new terminal building at Chakeri airport||Done/ALVI Times News Network Kanpur: Minister for civil aviation, UP, Nand Gopal Gupta Nandi, visited the under-construction new terminal building of Chakeri airport on Wednesday and expressed his displeasure over slow pace of working. He said carelessness would not be tolerated. The government would not only lodge FIRs against the officials of UP Rajkiya Nirman Nigam, the construction agency but even send them to jail, he warned. The agency could even be blacklisted if it failed to complete the job in the stipulated time, he said, and added the construction work of the civil enclave of Chakeri airport must be completed by December 31. During the minister’s visit to the Chakeri airport on November 1, the people’s representatives and passengers had complained to him about delay in construction of the civil enclave. Witnessing an increase in the number of passengers at the airport and after receiving the inquiry report, he came to know that the construction agency was not serious in constructing the building in time. In view of the complaints, the aviation minister on Wednesday visited Kanpur and chaired the review meeting which was attended among others by regional executive director Airport Authority of India DK Kamra, district magistrate Kanpur Nagar, Vishak G Iyer, officer of UP Rajkiya Nirman Nigam Satyaveer, additional director, civil aviation department Vishwa Bhushan Mishra, nodal officer Moti Rai and director, Chakeri airport BK Jha. The officials informed the minister that construction work of the new civil enclave had started in October 2019, and only 60 percent work could be completed in the last two years. At this, the minister got furious and said that by December 2021 the construction of the new terminal must be completed by December this year. Any carelessness would not be tolerated, he warned. He specifically directed the officials to start within 15 days the construction work of a 2.7 km-long four laned approach which would connect the new terminal. At present only one flight can be operated from the Chakri airport because it has just one apron where aircrafts are parked. The new civil enclave, which will have three aprons, can bear the load of around 500 persons at a time and can also handle three flights at a time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/minister-expresses-displeasure-over-construction-of-new-terminal-building-at-chakeri-airport/articleshow/87766428.cms||अनंत नारायण

A division bench of justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P Velmurugan was hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by S Rajendran, a resident of Bibikulam in Madurai. In his petition, Rajendran stated that recently he came to know that the shops which are functioning at Pudhu Mandapam, a heritage structure are to be shifted to the nearby Kunnathur Chathiram complex. He stated that nearly 300 shops were functioning at the Pudhu Mandapam and 20 shops in the old Kunnathur Chathiram building which was demolished in 2006. He stated that the authorities had promised to accommodate all the 300 shops and the 20 shops in the Kunnathur Chathiram complex. However, the newly-constructed complex has only the capacity to house only 200 shops. The pathways and the stairs in the building were also very narrow. He stated that the new complex which is a three-storeyed building has only one entrance and exit in the ground floor. As per the rules, each floor should have a separate exit. He stated that the shopping complex also does not have any separate emergency exit due to which the people would face difficulties while evacuating the building in case of emergencies. He further stated that there is no sufficient parking facility and no proper drainage facility due to which there is a possibility of water stagnation during the rainy season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/ensure-compliance-of-norms-at-kunnathur-chathiram-plea-in-hc/articleshow/87767251.cms||---
---||Kanpur||Atmanirbhar Bharat also means aiming to ‘make for the world’, says Rajnath||Jhansi: Raising the pitch for a self-reliant India, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday asserted that “the country is heading towards a strong Atmanirbhar Bharat, which not only means eyeing for ‘made in India’ products, but also aiming to ‘make for the world”. The defence minister was speaking after inaugurating the three-day ‘Rashtraraksha Samarpan Parv Jalsa’ in Jhansi in the presence of UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath at Muktakashi Manch near the historic Jhansi Fort. The event will witness a number of events related to the country's march towards attaining self-reliance in defence manufacturing. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to attend the concluding day on November 19, which happens to be the 193rd birth anniversary of Rani Laxmibai, the Rani of Jhansi. Praising Yogi and his work, Rajnath said, “He is a perfect combination of ‘karmyogi’ and ‘bhaktyogi’, who with his charismatic work has earned praise in the entire country, specially for handling law and order situations. This is the charisma of the Yogi Government that mafia elements’ heartbeat increases by the very name of Yogi. This is new India and new UP, where planes land on expressways and can be used for air traffic also.” Rajnath further said, “Gandhi’s ideology of Swadeshi is similar to Atmanirbhar Bharat concept, which the BJP is committed to fulfil. After independence we were struggling to establish ourselves depending completely on foreign aid. But now the country is heading towards strategic freedom and in the coming decade, we will make all our weapons and defence-related spares in our own country.” He said, “The government has given a whopping Rs 50,000 crores worth orders for defence equipment to the Hindustan Aeronautical Limited (HAL), which has happened for the first time in the country’s history. He also said that 10,000 MSME units are directly attached to the defence sector and as many as 209 types of equipment will be produced indigenously. “There was a time when 65% of defence equipment used to be imported, but today we have decided to generate work worth 64% of the capital budget indigenously. Whatever challenge comes our way we will face it just like Rani Laxmibai did. We are blessed that this country has the largest number of youth population,” Singh said, signifying the fact that the country is facing both conventional and non-conventional threats, including cyber and space threats other than terrorism and border issues. Praising the achievements of the country, Singh said that the life expectancy was only 32 years just after the independence which has increased to 70 years at present. “Similarly, literacy has reached 80% from 12% and the government is targeting to further make it cent percent. Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, our country has attained the vaccination target of 111 crore which is remarkable”. Recalling Rani Laxmibai’s contribution in the country's independence, Singh said, “The women have played an important role in the history of the country during the freedom movement but their role became marginalised after independence. But, in the Modi administration women have been given due importance.” “When I was the home minister, I had issued an advisory to include 35% women in police services. Today, the defence services have also opened the doors for the women. They are being admitted in both Sainik Schools and NDA and are being given permanent commission. Two lakh women had written the last competitive exam of NDA,” he added. Singh also inaugurated a three-day army equipment display at the Hati Ground, where the army has displayed some of the latest equipment used in modern warfare with a separate stall of DRDO showcasing latest inventions in arms and armaments. In his brief speech, Yogi said that it is a matter of pride that the defence corridor project in UP is surging ahead in a speedy manner and two of its important nodes fall in Bundelkhand region, including Jhansi and Chitrakoot. The CM promised that the Bundelkhand region, known for drought, will witness piped drinking water in each house of each village under ‘Har Ghar Nal Jal’ scheme by March 2022. “The supreme sacrifice of Rani Laxmibai will always motivate each and every Indian to become patriotic. The Rani was instrumental in fighting the British forces. Fables have always stated the valour of Rani and that of people of this region. Her famous line ‘I will not give my Jhansi’, sends shivers down the spine of each Indian. There is no better time than this when we are celebrating the 193rd birth anniversary of Rani along with 75 years of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav,” Yogi said. Box Story CM takes stock of preparations ahead of PM’s visit UP CM Yogi Adityanath visited Jhansi on Wednesday to review the preparations ahead of the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi scheduled on November 19. He went to the venue where the PM will address a limited gathering and dedicate/lay the foundation of a number of projects, including laying of the foundation stone of a Rs 400 crore plant under Bharat Dynamics for making propulsion system for anti-tank guided missiles. The CM also visited the Jhansi Fort, which is also scheduled to be visited by the PM. The CM later shared the dais with the Defence Minister for the inaugural ceremony of the Jalsa Parv.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/atmanirbhar-bharat-also-means-aiming-to-make-for-the-world-says-rajnath/articleshow/87766427.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Lulu is now Corp’s biggest tax payer; Rs 3.5cr annually||Thiruvananthapuram: Lulu shopping mall at Akkulam with its sprawling dimensions is now the biggest source of property tax for the city corporation. The civic body received a whopping Rs 3.51 crores from Lulu mall as annual property tax for the ongoing fiscal the other day. It was a mammoth assessment exercise for the Kadakampally zone office revenue team and they finished the assessment of 293 units in three days which has also projected the city corporation’s business friendly image in the city. This is the biggest amount ever received as property tax by the city corporation in its history and probably the quickest assessment for an expansive commercial building. Lulu's tax is actually double the cumulative tax paid by top tax payers in the city; three other shopping malls. Corporation collects Rs 1.5 crore annually from three major shopping malls in the city The entire Lulu building was categorised under different occupancies like cinema, office and the mall inclusive of parking area and utility space. About 12 screens measuring 11,096.30 sq.m were assessed at the rate of Rs 60 per sq.m. The office space measuring 2,320.04 sq.m was assessed at Rs 80 per sq.m. The tax for mall area and the parking area together comprising 1.99 lakh sq.m was assessed at Rs 150 per sq.m. In portions where the dimensions were below 200 sq.m tax was calculated at Rs 90 per sq.m. About 1,685 parking units were assessed for tax and a multi-level car parking facility was also included in the tax assessment. The library cess and service cess together accounted for almost half a crore - Rs 45.7 lakhs. Sources said that calculating tax for 293 units was a herculean task. There had to be proportionate calculations based on type of flooring and availability of centralised air-conditioning facility which will account for 15% increase in tax. The corporation also may have grossed an additional Rs 75 lakhs if the zone of the mall was different. Since Kadakampally was earlier a panchayat area, it was included in the tertiary zone which resulted in 20% tax reduction. The engineering wing had undertaken a total station survey prior to issuance of completion certificate for the building; which again was a tedious task given the size and extent of the building. The corporation officials said that there could be more revenue flow from the mall in the form of trade licenses once the commercial building is open to business. Payment of Rs 3 crores comes at a time when the corporation is publishing a list of arrears in each ward which runs into lakhs. Owing to Covid, there has been a yawning gap in the revenue and expenditure of the city corporation for the past few months. As per the figures compiled by the corporation in August, the inflow of revenue was just Rs 16 crores while the expenses had ballooned to Rs 114 crores. The alarming disparity in income and expenditure had forced the corporation to go out on a tax collection drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/lulu-is-now-corps-biggest-tax-payer-rs-3-5cr-annually/articleshow/87744781.cms||Aswin J Kumar

According to the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), 2021, there has been a clear shift from private schools to government schools in the last three years with 60% school-going children in the six to 14 age group in Telangana opting for government schools. About 57.6% boys and 62.9% girl enrolled in government schools in 2021, marking the 3.6% shift since 2018. In government schools across India, the average enrolment in 2018 was 64.3% which increased to 65.8% last year and 70.3% this year. Uttar Pradesh and Kerala reported the maximum increase in government school enrolment, with 13.2% and 11.9% respectively. Andhra Pradesh (8.4%) reported higher migration to state-run schools. Overall, at an all-India level, for children in the age group of six to 14, enrolment in private schools decreased from 32.5% in 2018 to 24.4% in 2021, the 16th ASER report stated. Families in Telangana and other states have not lost faith in education with almost 92% of children having textbooks of their own. About 87.6% kids in private and 93.2% kids in Telangana said they have access to textbooks, underscoring the government’s efforts to ensure books for all, especially in rural India. About 9.6% of the enrolled children in Telangana are taking private tuitions, marking a 3.7% increase since 2018. The largest increase has been among the most disadvantaged households, the report said. The usage of smartphones in Telangana have also increased to 79.3% compared to 45.8% in 2018, with more than 42.2% kids saying they have accessed classes with it. About 23.9% kids in Telangana said they could not access smartphones for studies at home, despite having one. The ASER is a household survey that provides nationally representative estimates of children's schooling status and their educational skills among the age group of 3-16 in all rural districts of India. “Last year, Covid-19 interrupted this trajectory, along with so much else. But with schools being closed since March 2020, understanding the effect of the pandemic on schools, families and children was crucial,” the report said. The report is based on a survey that was conducted in 25 states and three Union Territories. It covered a total of 76,706 households and 75,234 children in the age group of five to 16 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/most-t-students-can-access-smartphones/articleshow/87767254.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi's air quality a tad better but still in ‘very poor’ zone||NEW DELHI: Improvement might connote a wrong impression, but Delhi’s air quality did go from ‘severe’ on Tuesday to ‘very poor’ on Wednesday due to the easterly winds that barred the intrusion into the city of emission from stubble fires in the neighbouring states. A more sustained relief may only come three days later when the winds become stronger. On Wednesday, the air quality index (AQI) of Delhi logged 375 against 403 a day earlier. However, the PM2.5 level was over three times the safe limit of 60 micrograms per cubic metres at 195.7 to 218.8 micrograms per cubic metres. Even then, the capital was the third most polluted city in the country after Jind (382) and Faridabad (378). The easterly winds were not strong enough to transport the fire emissions and Delhi’s air quality was unlikely to worsen for the next two days. There won’t, however, be much improvement, with the air remaining in the higher to mid-range of the ‘very poor’ category. “Most of the winds during the day were south-easterly and easterly in direction, leading to a drop in the intrusion of excessive pollutants from stubble burning. That is perhaps the reason that city’s air came down from severe category. However the air is still very poor and will continue to be so for the next two days because the easterly and south-easterly winds will be slow and not capable of dispersing the pollutants,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, climate change and meteorology, Skymet. According to India Meteorological Department, the maximum wind speed on Wednesday was 8kmph. Met officials felt the quality could improve from November 21. “There is a possibility of a strong winds after November 20 with a very slight possibility of thunder showers in the region. This may improve the air quality,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, IMD The Union earth sciences ministry’s forecasting body, SAFAR, excepts the air to improve. “The AQI is likely to improve, but remain the same for the next two days. The local surface winds are low and the mixing layer height is about 1km, resulting in poor ventilation of near surface pollutants. From November 20 onward, the surface winds are likely to be strong, leading to effective dispersion of pollutants that improves air quality,” said SAFAR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/air-quality-a-tad-better-but-still-in-very-poor-zone/articleshow/87767267.cms||Kushagra Dixit

Of these, the average first dose vaccination in eight districts is below 60%. It is above 80% in 13 districts, including Mumbai, Pune, Bhandara, Sindhudurg and Gondia. The state’s average first dose vaccination coverage is 76.01% and it is 37.09% for the second dose, according to the November 15 report of the public health department. A total of 14 districts have registered first dose coverage between 61% and 76%. Eight districts — Hingoli, Nanded, Yavatmal, Akola, Aurangabad, Amravati, Beed and Nandurbar — were marked in red because their first dose beneficiaries ranged from 56% to 60%. Additional chief secretary, health, Dr Pradeep Vyas has directed all the collectors to draw up a plan to ensure 100% vaccination of first dose beneficiaries by November 30. “Now, we have started the Har Ghar Dastak campaign and proactively approaching those yet to get the first dose as well as the beneficiaries who have missed their second dose. We shall attempt to ensure that by November 30 all eligible population receive at least one shot of vaccination,” he told TOI. State public health officials stated that local authorities had been asked to draw up their plans in order to ensure that eligible people were vaccinated at the earliest. “The local authorities, while carrying out the door-to-door campaign, should ensure that all adult beneficiaries have taken the first dose and they should also check for the time of the second dose to ensure that they are vaccinated,” said a senior health official. As on Wednesday, a total of 3.46 crore people have been fully vaccinated in the state. “The low percentage of second dose coverage could be mainly because of the gap in Covishield doses or laxity in taking it. The officials have been asked to keep a track of the second dose beneficiaries and to find out the reason why those due for it have not taken it. They should be persuaded to get a shot and to go to the nearest vaccination centre,” said the official. The state task force members stressed on double vaccination to reduce the severity of the disease and deaths. “Double vaccination and proper ventilation is a mandate that should be followed,” said a task force member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covid-vaccination-rate-below-state-average-in-22-districts/articleshow/87767258.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Save Education Campaign Committee had said that there was an attempt at backdoor appointment in Kannur University and alleged that Varghese didn’t have the minimum eligibility for the post of associate professor being a research degree with eight years’ experience at the assistant professor level. The petition claimed that Priya joined as an assistant professor in Sri Kerala Varma College in 2012 and while working there she had availed three years’ leave under the FDP programme for completing her PhD. They had cited Clause 3.9 of UGC Regulations 2018 to claim that the time taken by candidates to acquire MPhil/PhD degree shall not be considered as teaching/research experience for appointment to the teaching position. Meanwhile, varsity authorities said that Varghese had requisite qualifications for the post. They said that she had conducted research under faculty improvement programme, which is envisaged to provide opportunity to teachers to pursue their academic/research activities and it cannot be considered as a service break. Now the programme has been rechristened as Faculty Development Programme. The varsity had invited applications for appointment for eight associate professor posts and two assistant professor posts on Sept 22 and the last date for submitting application online was Oct 30 and the last date for submitting hard copies was Nov 12. The screening committee meeting was held on Nov 13 and a shortlist of six candidates was prepared. The campaign committee had alleged that the screening procedure was carried out in haste to make the appointment before the end of tenure of the present vice-chancellor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/kannur-university-to-hold-interview-today/articleshow/87767273.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Tope tells collectors to make list of 1st & 2nd shot beneficiaries||Pune: Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday told TOI that all collectors in the state had been directed to check for the first and second dose of anti-Covid vaccine beneficiaries by referring to the election list and persuade citizens to get completely inoculated within the stipulated time. The state is trying to achieve cent-per-cent inoculation of the first dose beneficiaries by November 30. In the wake of the Aurangabad collector issuing strict orders to scale up vaccination and saying people without a single dose of the vaccine will not get petrol or gas, Tope told TOI that he had directed all the collectors to persuade citizens to scale up the inoculation drive through persuasive methods and the Har Ghar Dastak programme. A day after his interaction with Union health minister Mansukh Mandviya, Tope said the state wanted to speed up the vaccinations but the Centre was “not keen” on reducing the gap between the Covishield doses. “We had requested the Centre to reduce the gap to 28 days. But going by the scientific advice, they are not keen and said the current gap of 84 days is ideal,” the state health minister said. Tope said he had even told the government that since it allowed the second dose to be administered within a gap of 28 days to those going abroadf for studies or work, the same arrangement could have been made for all citizens. Tope said the Centre was keen on completing the existing adult vaccination programme first and then discuss the booster doses. The state has sought funds for additional manpower in case of a third wave of the pandemic and urged the Centre to re-start the National Health Mission Scheme. “The Union health minister is willing to discuss the issue,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tope-tells-collectors-to-make-list-of-1st-2nd-shot-beneficiaries/articleshow/87767280.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Delhi||Delhi: How states, NTPC failed to fulfil vows to tackle stubble||NEW DELHI: Neither public sector company NTPC’s plan to procure biomass pellets in adequate quantities, nor the northern states’ assurances to use bio-decomposer in identified areas to deal with paddy stubble could fully achieve their targets, leading to the air pollution crisis in the capital. Officials in the environment ministry who analysed what went wrong with the promises made to it in its September review meeting on the issue noted that the situation could have been much better if Punjab and Haryana and the National Thermal Power Corporation had worked as per their respective plans to deal with crop residue. “NTPC had promised us under their existing plan to use 20 million tonnes of stubble for four years. But it could manage only around 3.5 million tonnes. It’s a big let down. We were banking on the public sector entity to deal with the situation to an extent,” said an official. He said the states “told us that they, along with private companies, would help farmers use IARI’s Pusa bio-decomposer in over 16 lakh acres of paddy-grown areas free of cost. Even that could not happen. Only half of what they promised has been covered so far.” NTPC has, however, reasons for being short on targets as, officials said, the issue is on the supply side and not on the demand side. None of the stubble-burning states have invested in or incentivised setting up of units for making pellets from farm residue resulting in a dearth of pellets. Company executives said it has received only 58,000 tonnes of pellets against orders for 9.5 lakh tonnes of pellets. "NTPC has been running sustained ad campaigns in the catchment states to encourage and promote setting up of pellet-making units and their benefits to farmers but that hasn't improved supply. We are again launching a campaign to promote pellet-making," a senior company executive said. The policy of using farm residue pellets in NTPC's power plants was announced on November 16, 2017. An acre of cropping yields about two tonnes of stubble or straw. A tonne of stubble fetches Rs 5,500, which yields an additional income of about Rs 11,000 per acre for farmers. Ash generated from burning of agro residue-based fuel in power plants gets absorbed in electrostatic precipitators and does not cause air pollution. Also, the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide emitted from their combustion is absorbed in the next crop cycle by photosynthesis, which does not increase the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-states-ntpc-failed-to-fulfil-vows-to-tackle-stubble/articleshow/87767306.cms||Vishwa Mohan

SDM University vice-chancellor Dr Niranjan Kumar and Dr Pallavi signed the MoU. Dr Pallavi said it has been observed that many children are deprived of mother's milk which is considered as elixir of life. Hence, the milk bank will be set up here. The total cost of the bank is $77,000 dollars of which $15,000 dollars is donated by the Karnataka Vikas Grameen Bank and the remaining amount is funded by Rotary Club Seven Hills and some clubs in USA. Pasteurization machines have been imported from Sweden as the milk donated by the lactating mothers should be stored in minus 30 degrees Celsius. SDM hospital has donated the space for setting up the milk bank and this will cater to the needs to both urban and rural babies requiring mother's milk. It has also been decided to open a satellite centre at Civil Hospital.

The paddy ruin has adversely affected farmers in the seven villages of Vadgaon, Shahpur, Angol, Yellur, Dhamni, Halaga and Mahavapura. Besides the water damaging 50 per cent of the standing crop, half of the post-harvest paddy kept in the fields for threshing were washed away, dashing farmers’ hopes of earning from them, the agriculture department has said. The farmers have demanded compensation from the government. Farmer Raju M said the water from the Rajahansgad hillock area flows down into Ballari Nala (channel). However due to development activity like roads and buildings, the water entered arable land. On Tuesday, there was no clue about the heavy rainfall, otherwise the farmers would have made arrangements to protect their produce, he said. Raju further said that the Halaga-Macche bypass construction was a big blow to farmers as it obstructed the flow of water and this was inundating fields in surrounding areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/untimely-heavy-rain-destroys-paddy-in-seven-belagavi-villages/articleshow/87765498.cms||---

The interim order was given by a bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A Rajashekher Reddy while hearing separate petitions against these allotments. Appearing for the petitioners, senior counsel S Satyam Reddy accused the state of being whimsical and not following any procedure. “The state is not the owner. The state is only a trustee of these plots. People are real owners. State cannot dole it out to undeserving entities,” Satyam Reddy said, citing the case of two richest communities being given 5 acre plot each in the heart of Hi-Tec city. “If the state puts these plots for auction, it would get Rs 1,000 crore,” he said. Satyam Reddy pointed out that a rich businessman from one of the two communities even gave a blank cheque to raise a palace in the plot to serve as an association building. “This shows the economic status of the community and the state is doling out precious land for a pittance to such entities. There are 792 communities in the state, will the state give similar largesse to all of them?” he asked. State’s special counsel A Santhosh Kumar claimed that the state has a policy to allot plots to various communities who have begun constructions. The bench sought counters from the state. It however refused to stay the constructions. “All constructions will be subject to the judgment we deliver in the current pleas,” the bench said. case will come up again on January 3, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-to-decide-fateof-bldgs-on-landfor-caste-groups/articleshow/87767289.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

He also denied allegations by Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis that the rallies were carried out with the support of the state government. “These were self-declared rallies and protests in which people participated or were made to participate and different groups provoked each other,” Walse Patil told a television channel. He said that he did not agree with Fadnavis’s statement but adding that “if the Opposition has any information they want to give, we will examine it”. Walse Patil further said that this was not the time for anyone to make provocative statements. This week, the police arrested several BJP leaders, including former minister Anil Bonde, inconnection with the rioting in Amravati. When asked if the state government would actagainst political leaders even from the ruling party or the Raza Academy, if found guilty, Walse Patil said, “We will act against those found guilty even if they are leaders from political parties or from any organization.” When asked whether the state government had any idea about the whereabouts of former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh who has been declared absconding, the home minister said, “I can’t tell you anything at this time.” Walse Patil added that the fact that Singh has declared that he had no proof to back his allegations of corruption against former home minister Anil Deshmukh shows that he made the allegations only to defame the MVA government. When asked whether Mumbai Police would act against NCB zonal director Samir Wankhede who is under acloud after the arrest of actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan in the cruise drug bust case, he said, “The police are doing their work. It not be appropriate for me to comment.” Walse Patil said the Centre was using its agencies to create pressure on the MVA government, but it would remain strong and complete its term. “Central agencies are being used even in small cases. This is a little too much. The MVA government is strong and will complete its term. The three parties will remain together even in the future,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/protest-rallies-self-declared-no-state-support-in-mumbai-home-min/articleshow/87768393.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

The November chill, as a result, was likely to be missing from the city for another five to seven days, a senior official from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) told TOI on Wednesday. On Tuesday, November rain lashed several parts of the city, causing instances of power outage. The rain amounts were, however, in single digit in most places. Shivajinagar had received 7.4mm rain, Lohegaon 9.4mm, Pashan 9.2mm, Chinchwad 15mm, Lavale 4.5 mm and Magarpatta got 5mm. Senior IMD scientist K S Hosalikar, also head of surface instruments division at the Climate Research and Services, IMD, Pune, told TOI, “November rains are not unusual though unexpected as per long-term climatological data. Generally, the southwest monsoon withdraws from the country by mid-October. October is part of the post-monsoon season, which is also the cyclone season. It is thus a favorable period for the formation of low-pressure systems over the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal.” These low pressure systems could then intensify into more intense systems such as well-marked low pressure areas or depressions, he said. “If these systems over the oceans are closer to the land area, they give rain. With the northeast monsoon also being active, various systems can cause moisture incursion over parts of South peninsular India, as well as Maharashtra, aiding the rainfall,” said Hosalikar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rain-likely-to-continue-for-2-3-days-wait-for-november-chill-gets-longer/articleshow/87767290.cms||Neha Madaan

The CoWIN data revealed that the average daily vaccination for the second dose remained in the range of 25,000 to 28,000 from November 7 to November 17. Between 8,000 and 10,000 first doses were administered per day in the same duration. The data revealed that on November 13, around 37,507 beneficiaries were vaccinated with the second dose — the highest in the past 10 days.

An official from the public health services, Pune circle, said around nine lakh beneficiaries were eligible for the second dose of Covishield and about one lakh were eligible for the second shot of Covaxin on November 1. As the vaccination centres were closed during the Diwali holidays, the second dose vaccination picked up the pace post-Diwali. The official said the record vaccination of Covishield in September would also result in an increased number of eligible beneficiaries for the second dose in November and December. The second dose of Covishield needs to be administered between the 12th and 16th week from the date of the first dose. The district health department officials stated that the vaccination in rural Pune, lagging in the district, would get the much necessary boost through the “Har Ghar Dastak” drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/second-dose-vax-picks-up-pace-post-diwali/articleshow/87767291.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The agency plans to take up the matter with social media websites and hosting platforms — widely used in this case to circulate the explicit materials — and examine their role and liability, an official said. Earlier, the agency had made arrests in the case following registration of 23 FIRs on November 14 and country-wide raids on Tuesday. The arrested men claimed that the obscene content was uploaded by them on certain websites and the URLs were then shared in chat groups. The hosts received payments on the basis of the number of views on the materials. Initial probe suggested that there are over 50 groups with over 5,000 offenders where child sexual abuse material are shared. These include foreign nationals from nearly 100 countries. The CBI has also zeroed in on around 31 suspects from Bangladesh, 28 from Nigeria, 30 from Sri Lanka, 27 from Azerbaijan and 24 from Yemen, said sources. “The CBI plans to coordinate with various foreign law enforcement agencies for further action...,” an agency spokesperson said. Investigators had earlier confirmed that some individuals were involved in trading child abuse material for monetary benefits. During searches of electronic gadgets like mobiles and laptops, it was revealed that several people were commercially disseminating explicit material by sharing links, videos, pictures, texts, posts and hosting such content on social media and third-party platforms, an official said. “Money trail is being followed to work out the linkages of the offenders,” said the source. The agency also plans to coordinate with the International Child Sexual Exploitation Database for comparing the child sexual abuse images and trace their origin. As per the Interpol, an estimated 2.4 million instances of online child sexual abuse were reported from India from 2017 to 2020, CBI sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/us-pakistan-residents-in-child-porn-racket/articleshow/87768902.cms||Raj Sekhar

Since the state government does not allot funds for maintenance of the range, members of TRA and the Indian Rifle Association have pooled money for essential works. Despite SATS claiming that electronic target systems have been installed at the shooting range, aspiring and renowned shooters allege that half of the range is still manual. Seniors mostly practise at trap and skeet ranges. Saber Ali Khan, a doctor and well-known shooter, said there was an urgent need for upgrading the facilities at the SATS shooting range as per the standards of International Shooting Sport Federation. “We are lagging behind states like Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat. There is a big disparity between funding they get and what we get here. There is zero money for the shooting range from the state,” he said. Shooter A Ansari, who is a member of TRA and NRA, said the government should step in and provide more support to the shooting range. “We have seen kids coming here and turning into Olympians. Quality infrastructure is the need of the hour,” he said. Shooters said there was no problem as far as licensing from police is concerned, but the renewals were taking six months.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will inaugurate the festival on February 4 at 6 pm at Nishagandhi auditorium. The festival will be held in all its glory in 12 theatres in the city, said a press note issued by Chalachitra Academy. The international documentary and short film festival which could not be held owing to the spread of Covid will be held from December 9 to 14 at Aries Plex SL theatre complex in four screens. The chief minister will inaugurate the festival on December 9. The decision to decentralise the conduct of 25th edition of International film festival of Kerala had kicked up a row in 2020. IFFK was held in four locations and the schedule was revised as a five day festival in five theatres in respective locations. Festival followers had regarded the decision as a move to take IFFK away from Trivandrum.  With KSFDC theatres going for renovation and demolition of a theatre, the academy decided to push the date to February.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/iffk-to-be-held-from-feb-4-to-11/articleshow/87744808.cms||---

But only a handful of private retailers began their new foray into alcohol retail after Delhi government quit the business and its 650 vends or so pulled down the shutters. Drink connoisseurs could be seen running around from one location to another searching for their preferred brand, but in vain. TimesViewThe new excise policy is forward-thinking. It will benefit customers and increase revenue collection. The money, in turn, should be used judiciously for public welfare projects.The new excise policy has put alcohol sales in the hands of private retailers who are required to arrange spacious liquor stores and stock an array of offerings. But on the first day of the policy implementation on Wednesday, many buyers, like Shekhar Ranjan, were left disappointed. “It feels like a dry day. I have checked a couple of liquor shops in Mayur Vihar but they didn’t have stocks,” said Ranjan outside a liquor store at a Mayur Vihar mall. A liquor store in Dwarka opened on Wednesday but the shelves in the swanky store were empty. “Many customers turned up but returned empty handed. We have placed orders for liquor, but they are yet to be delivered,” said the store manager. It was similar across the city. The authorities had promised a smooth transition from the old excise policy to the new to prevent an alcohol scarcity, but the first day of the new regime was marked by chaos. The tiny old vends are to give way to spacious stores stocking all brands in airconditioned environs. The new shops are unlikely to appear crowded because there is adequate space inside for the customers to amble around exploring what to buy. There will be 850 new showroom-like liquor stores across the city under the new excise policy. The policy has also divided Delhi into 32 liquor zones. Each zone comprising 8-10 municipal wards will have 27 liquor stores, ensuring equal distribution of alcohol retailers in the capital. Excise commissioner Arava Gopi Krishna did not reply to TOI’s messages seeking clarity on the prevailing situation. A government official disclosed that provisional licences have been given to over 350 shops, 206 brands have been registered and 10 wholesale licensees have begun procuring over 9 lakh litres of liquor of various brands. While industry watchers expect prices to go up by around 10%, the government has countered that with liquor shops permitted to offer discounts, any rise in prices would be neutralised by such rate markdowns. Liquor traders said that since many of the shops are just getting ready and are getting interiors designing and furniture work completed, it might take some days for the city’s tipplers to shout, “Cheers!”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/day-1-many-tipplers-left-high-and-dry/articleshow/87767325.cms||AlokKNMishra

Besides, four more patients succumbed to the infection in the region in the last 24 hours, including two deaths each from the Pune municipal limits and the rural parts. The Pimpri Chinchwad municipal areas did not record any death on Wednesday, a report released by the district health officer, Bhagwan Pawar, stated. The report said the PMC and rural parts added more than 100 patients each on Wednesday, while the cases in the PCMC limits remained below 50. While the areas under PMC added 106 new cases, as many as 104 people tested positive for the infection in the rural parts, the data revealed. As for recoveries, 69 people were discharged in the PMC limits on Wednesday, while 45 people were sent home after successful recovery in the PCMC limits. In the rural parts of PMR, 78 recovered in the last 24 hours. The daily sample testing increased to 14,256 on Wednesday. More than 5,100 tests were conducted in the PMC limits, while more than 4,500 samples were checked each in the rural pockets and the PCMC areas. The region’s positivity rate stood at 1.8% on Wednesday. So far, more than 84 lakh tests have been conducted in the region. The region’s active caseload reached 2,099 on Wednesday evening. As many as 1,071 patients were in home isolation and remaining were being treated at hospitals. Health officials maintained that people needed to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour like wearing masks and maintaining social distance in spite of getting fully vaccinated. “Taking two doses of vaccine helps in checking infection and its severity. But, breakthrough infections do still occur. People need to exercise caution and abide by the Covid norms,”a health official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/257-test-ve-in-pmr-192-recover-four-more-dead/articleshow/87767315.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Chennai||Without witness protection, justice hangs in the balance||CHENNAI: The film ‘Jai Bhim’ on police atrocity on a tribal family has brought back the public gaze to custodial torture and violence and the mechanisms of the state enforcement machinery. The recent judgment of the special court, Cuddalore, in the murder of the inter-caste couple Kannagi and Murugesan, who were killed by the former's family because Murugesan was a dalit, recapitulates the workings of the police force. The court in this case convicted the 11 family members and two police personnel (then inspector and the sub-inspector) who were hand-in-glove with the perpetrators of the dual murders. Police were found to have fabricated documents, intimidated witnesses, tampered with evidence and foisted false cases against the innocent. Justice prevailed after 18 years due to the perseverance of human rights lawyers and activists, who supported victims and ensured their safety during the trial and thereafter. Witnesses and victims were not given protection by the state, resulting in 36 of the 81 prosecution witnesses turning ‘hostile’ during the trial. The state’s obligation to uphold human rights includes witness protection and assistance. The witness protection scheme adopted and declared to be the law by the Supreme Court on December 6, 2018, is the sole programme that governs the rights of a witness to provide testimony before investigative and enforcement agencies without reprisal. The Union government finalised the scheme in consultation with states and the National Legal Services Authority. The scheme has laudable objectives, but with fallacious procedures and substance, it fails to safeguard the witness and victim during investigation, trial and thereafter. The competent authority (comprising district judge, head of police and head of prosecution in the district) passes the witness protection order based on the threat analysis report (TAR) prepared by the head of the police of the police subdivision concerned. A maximum of three months of protection for the witness and absence of penalty for breach in confidentiality concerning witness details does not repose faith in the scheme. The nexus between police and high-profile offenders appears entrenched within the system, leaving the witness and the victim without a remedy. When impunity prevails the perpetrators become emboldened to threaten and inflict violence on victims and witnesses. The Supreme Court observed in a multitude of cases that "criminal case is built on the edifice of evidence and for that witness is required" and has rued about the absence of statutory protection for witnesses and victims of abuses and violence. In the case of Zahira Habibullah Sheikh vs State of Gujarat (2004), the top court called for "legislative measures to emphasise prohibition against tampering with witness, victim or informant". The Law Commission reports have been a useful resource in guiding the courts on witness protection, particularly the 172 Report (2000) on ‘Review of Rape Laws’ prepared on the direction of the Supreme Court in Sakshi vs Union of India (2004). The judgment in the case ensured that witnesses and victims of child sex abuse and rape are separated by a screen from the accused, for them to depose without fear. Lack of a legislative framework for maintaining anonymity of witnesses and for their protection has often led to witnesses turning ‘hostile’. The Constitution guarantees to the accused the fundamental right to a fair trial, but the right needs to strike a balance with the right of the victim and the witness for protection against recrimination. The Indian Evidence Act offers minimalist protection to victims and witnesses that confine them against being asked scandalous questions and the Indian Penal Code under a 2006 amendment penalises criminal intimidation of witnesses. Two bills on the protection of the identity of witnesses and witness protection were introduced in Parliament but they could not metamorphose into a statute. Witness protection is in the national limelight as the Supreme Court has directed the Uttar Pradesh government to grant protection to the witnesses of the Lakhimpur Kheri violence that claimed the lives of protesting farmers, after having been allegedly mowed down by a convoy of the son of a Union minister. The court expressed surprise at the restraint shown by witnesses to depose on the violence that had a gathering of hundreds of protesters, reinforcing that the witness protection scheme needs re-examination. Considering the recurrent phenomenon of witnesses fearing to provide testimony, the Union government should conduct an audit and revamp the scheme, until a comprehensive law is enacted. While doing so, both mechanisms of witness protection and witness assistance, which includes financial, medical, material, psychological and social support to victims and witnesses, need to be incorporated. Basic principles for a witness protection programme that include independence, neutrality and inclusivity should feature in the new scheme. The investigative machinery must be separate from protection mechanisms to avoid compromising sensitive information or using protection as leverage in exchange for information. The revamped scheme and the new law could draw from best practices from across the world, specifically the Philippines and South Africa that have placed witness protection and assistance in a centralised agency. Witnesses, after all, are "the eyes and ears of justice".

This is a question that Bordeaux-based artist Emmanuelle Leblanc examines and tries to answer through ‘Shine!’, a project that studies female presence through installation of large portraits at city’s public places. From November 18 to December 19, Leblanc’s work will be on display at the State Art Gallery, KBR Park and elsewhere in the city as part of Indian Photo Festival. Produced from digitally enhanced photographs, the larger-than-life portraits explore identities and span generations. The models are both Indian and European but are united in their embodiment of an independent, strong or resilient position. Leblanc’s work draws on Colour Field movement that uses expressive power of colour to make possible a new way to experience space. Leblanc’s project follows an experiment in 2014 in Vitry-sur-Seine in France as part of International Women’s Day. It is a development of work started by her during a residency in Hyderabad in 2019. Project is a collaboration between Alliance Francaise of Hyderabad, Bordeaux Metropole, French Institute in Paris and French Institute in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/artists-vision-places-women-at-centrestage-of-public-space/articleshow/87767311.cms||---

Meanwhile, college principal M Rema refuted the allegations and said that the student had tried to attack her when she questioned a group of students for violating Covid guidelines by not wearing face masks and added that the student came to her room later and touched her feet on his own, tendering an apology. MSF state president PK Navas said in a news conference on Wednesday that the college principal made a second year degree student touch her feet thrice after summoning him to her office saying that she had received a complaint against him. He also showed a photograph of the student touching the feet of the principal. Meanwhile, the principal said that she had informed the police about the bid to attack her and the police had collected a fine from the student for not wearing a face mask and the police had told her that they would take action if she gave a written complaint. “When I came back to my office I had received a lot of phone calls saying that the student was ready to apologize and touch my feet and that I should forgive him. Later, he came to my office room and touched my feet and apologized,” she said.

---||Pune||Experts want wards of high-risk parents on priority list too||Pune: Children of comorbid parents should also be prioritised for Covid vaccination, besides kids having comorbidities, to prevent the transmission of infection from children to their high-risk parents or grandparents at home, experts underlined. “It is true that when we vaccinate children of high-risk parents, it will prevent the transmission of infection from children to their high-risk parents/grandparents. Therefore, after vaccination of high-risk children, the next priority should be the immunization of children of high-risk parents,” said senior paediatrician Pramod Jog, a member of the state’s paediatric Covid task force. The state’s paediatric task force last week submitted its views to the government to preferentially vaccinate children with underlying medical conditions like obesity and others. The demand to vaccinate children of high-risk parents started after it. “Vaccination of children of high-risk parents with underlying medical conditions would help prevention of transmission to older age groups and high-risk household members,” said Sanjay Patil, the chairman of the Indian Medical Association's Hospital Board of India (HBI), Pune chapter. The two Covid vaccines — ZyCoV-D and Covaxin — are to be introduced under the country’s Covid immunization programme by December-end. Evidence suggests that kids with medical complexity can be at an increased risk. Stress on school attendance The Covid vaccines would not be available to healthy kids initially. About seven-eight months may be needed for inoculation of all the children. Hence, schooling should not be withheld for such a long period, experts stressed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-want-wards-of-high-risk-parents-on-priority-list-too/articleshow/87767344.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The RHB not only developed permanent shops for Tibetans, but also earned a revenue of Rs 22 crore from the market, which was redundant. At the inauguration, urban development and housing (UDH) minister Shanti Dhariwal said, “The previous government developed this market without planning and it was not utilised. The RHB commissioner not only gave a fresh lease to the market, but also earned revenue for the board after 13 years.”RHB commissioner Pawan Arora said, “At the RHB board meeting, it was decided to allot 266 shops to Tibetan Refugee Hosiery Readymade Seller Union by lottery. These shops were allotted at the reserve price of 2014-15. While the ground floor shops have been allotted for Rs 8.60 lakh, the basement and first floors were given for Rs 5.57 lakh. The allottees can pay the amount in installments for 5 years.”In 2003, when Operation Pink was started by the state government, a survey was conducted by Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) for the construction of permanent shops to rehabilitate of makeshift shopowners. On the basis the survey report, the planning of Jhulelal Market was done for rehabilitation of these makeshift shopowners. In all, 355 eligible applicants registered to buy shops in this market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rhb-earns-rs-22cr-after-selling-266-shops-in-jhulelal-market/articleshow/87768080.cms||---
---||Nagpur||‘Nevale’s demise a big loss to Vid statehood movement’||Nagpur: One of the pioneers of Vidarbha statehood movement, Ram Nevale, breathed his last in the early hours of Wednesday. The 74-year-old was a stalwart in the pro-statehood agitations, with decades of grassroots connect and knowledge of what ails the Vidarbha farming community. Former state attorney general Shreehari Aney said, “I am saddened by this news. He was a great fighter and a genuine human being who loved Vidarbha passionately. He was one of those few leaders who knew Vidarbha’s grassroots. The loss is irreplaceable.” Starting off as a farmers’ leader in the 80s, Nevale was associated with late veteran Sharad Joshi and his Shetkari Sanghatna. As the years went by, Nevale got more and more involved with the separate Vidarbha cause as he felt that was the only way to bring the region out of its backwardness. His Vidarbha Rajya Andolan Samiti (VRAS) worked tirelessly to create awareness and even fight for justice for the region and its farmers. It was just over two months ago that Rambhau, as he was fondly called, threw his hat in the political ring by launching the Jai Vidarbha Party (JVP). Registering the party in September this year, Nevale’s plan was to field candidates for the upcoming municipal corporation polls. Sandesh Singalkar, a staunch Vidarbha statehood supporter, said, “Rambhau was a 24/7 Vidarbha statehood activist. He had dedicated his life completely to the movement. I spoke to him just last week and he was talking about some plans for the civic polls. It’s absolutely shocking that our generation won’t have his guidance anymore.” Nitin Ronghe, convener of Mahavidarbha Janjagaran, said, “It’s a big blow to the movement as he was a great support to all of us. We had different views with him regarding Vidarbha Statutory Development Board but we were on the same page that there is no alternative to separate Vidarbha state.” Tejinder Singh Renu, a statehood proponent, said, “It’s a loss because political pressure is very much needed when fighting for such a cause. And Rambhau was a stalwart whose presence espoused confidence in others who also believe in statehood.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nevales-demise-a-big-loss-to-vid-statehood-movement/articleshow/87767342.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

STR field director RN Meena said, “There are a total of 18 families in the village. The remaining will be shifted within two months.”The forest administration’s efforts to educate villagers in recent past have started yielding efforts as more villages are coming forward to move out of the forest. “Shifting of two more villages is in the pipeline. Recently, the head of forest forces (HoFF), DN Pandey, also inspected the areas, where villagers were shifted,” said an official.Most of the families that had shifted opted for land packages. The package includes 6 bighas of agricultural land, a 60 x 90 square-feet plot and an electric connection for agriculture. “The families of Sukola village will be rehabilitated in Tijara. The villagers, who moved out earlier have witnessed an increase in land value here,” said a district administration official.Once the village is entirely razed, the area can be occupied by the big cats, including male ST-13, tigresses ST-14 and ST- 17 and ST-20. As per records, there were 26 villages in the CTH proposed to be relocated which are said to be violating the tiger habitat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sariska-officials-to-relocate-4th-village-to-expand-tiger-habitat/articleshow/87768089.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Hitting back at the BJP and opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis’s comments that no one in the state was ready to accept Thackeray as CM and that the MVA government has no existence, Raut said. “Ever since Thackeray took over the reins of the state, 11 crore people think that they are the CM...This is a big thing in a democracy. No minister in the Modi government thinks he is a minister. I don’t think even MPs think that they are MPs.” Taking a dig at Fadnavis, who had said there was no rule of law in the state, he said, “Maharashtra used to be a state whi-ch used to ‘give’ to the ruling pa-rty. The rule of law came two years ago. I can understand the pain of those who are out of power and not getting anything now.” The Sena blamed ‘fake Hindutvawadis’ for the violence in Amravati, saying communal tensions were stoked for political mileage ahead of UP assembly polls. Raut said: “If you heard the CM’s Dussehra rally speech, he had made it clear that the real danger was from fake Hindutvawadis. They bring up Hindu-Muslim and India-Pakistan issues when polls are near...They intend communal tension...We all know who these people are.” —Chaitanya Marpakwar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-raut-hits-back-at-fadnavis-for-barb-against-cm-thackeray/articleshow/87768405.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Virus lingers on in ‘dead’ zones like basins, corners: IIT-Bombay study||MUMBAI: Infectious aerosols can linger in the air up to 10 times longer in “dead zones” in enclosed spaces. Slow air circulation in these dead zones —areas above washbasins in washrooms, behind doors, corners and around furniture— can be a potential source of Covid infection transmission, a team of researchers from IIT Bombay (IIT-B) has found. This finding holds more significance now as an increasing number of public places, including restaurants, theatres, malls, and schools and colleges, are being opened up. The team studied air flow in a public washroom to arrive at the conclusion. “Ideally, air in a room should be continuously replaced with fresh air for proper ventilation, but it gets trapped in areas behind the door, in corners, around furniture or behind some obstacle. While windows, fans, air conditioners and exhaust fans keep most parts of a room properly ventilated, in these dead zones, the air gets trapped and keeps going in a circular motion. Technically, these are called recirculation zones. These zones were identified using computer simulation for the study,” said professor Krishnendu Sinha from the department of aerospace engineering at IIT-B. The researchers were motivated to study how air flow could be managed better in closed rooms. Using computer simulation, the researchers have demonstrated the importance of proper ventilation in closed rooms to mitigate Covid transmission. For their study, they created a computer model of the washroom and found that the area above the washbasin was found to be a dead zone. “The ventilation systems are often designed keeping in mind the air changes per hour (ACH) value. This is assuming every corner is getting fresh air, but our simulations have shown us that some corners do not get fresh air as quickly as other open parts. If infected people are using it, then it is important to pump in fresh air swiftly in these zones,” said Sinha. Chances of infection are significantly higher in these dead zones as infectious aerosols (after the washroom is used by a Covid-infected person) can linger up to 10 times longer as compared to other well-ventilated parts of the room, the team found. The study titled ‘Effects of Recirculation Zones on the Ventilation of a Public Washroom’ co-authored by Sinha, Mani Shankar Yadav, Utkarsh Verma and Janani S Murallidharan from IIT-B and Vivek Kumar (from a Pune-based firm) was published in the journal Physics of Fluids on November 2. They have recommended using additional fans or ducts facing the dead zones to mitigate the spread of infection. Using fans can help ventilate dead zones. In their experiment, they found keeping a washroom door partially open, facing the basin, could be helpful too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/virus-lingers-on-in-dead-zones-like-basins-corners-iit-bombay-study/articleshow/87767359.cms||Yogita Rao

The police identified the accused as Anilkumar of Injavila near Thrikkaruva. He had allegedly caused critical injuries to his sister Anitha by stabbing her using a knife during a quarrel. The police said that the incident related to the case took place a day ago. Anilkumar had a personal dispute with Anitha's son. This dispute had caused a rift between the two siblings. On the day of the alleged crime, Anilkumar turned up at Anitha's residence and picked up a quarrel with her son. This spat soon intensified and both men broke into a fist fight. Anitha intervened to stop the fight. But, Anilkumar grabbed a knife he was carrying and stabbed her. She was first rushed to a private hospital nearby and then to Kollam district government hospital. From there, she was referred to the medical college hospital here. The accused was caught by a team led by Anchalummood station house officer inspector C Devarajan from a relative's house where he was hiding. Shortly after the arrest, the accused was produced before the court and remanded in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/man-held-for-stabbing-sister/articleshow/87744860.cms||---

It was found that one molecule offered longer protection time than DEET, considered a gold standard for insect repellent. The NCL researchers synthesised this novel molecule,which was found to be an effective repellent on the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which are causes of fatal diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika virus. The team found several compounds from this series appeared to possess good mosquito-repellent properties. Most notably, the mean protection time for the molecule NDS100100 was 756 minutes, which was higher than that of DEET (616 minutes). The team was led by Dr. D. S. Reddy, who is the director of CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu. The team included Akshay S. Kulkarni, Remya Ramesh, Safal Walia, Shahebaz I. Sayyad and Awvalokiteswar Sen. The research was published on November 12 in the journal — American Chemical Society Omega. Reddy said, “Mosquito control by personal protection is an efficient way of curtailing deadly diseases. DEET has been in use as a repellent for over 75 years and is a gold standard.” Sen said, “DEET is a viscous, oily substance . It is a skin irritant and can sometimes cause severe epidermal reactions. In view of these limitations, there is an urgent need to develop repellents that are safer and longer-lasting. Our studies indicated that NDS100100 appeared to possess the potential to be developed as an effective mosquito repellent.” “The molecule needs to undergo several studies before it reaches the market. Discussions are on with leading companies to take this forward for further studies towards commercialization,” Sen added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/researchers-identify-novel-mosquito-repelling-molecule/articleshow/87767354.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

There are hospitals, schools and religious institutions in the close range of the proposed store. We have written to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and health minister Satyendar Jain,” said Mahavir Singh Dahiya, president of Rohini B Block Residents Welfare Association that caters to around 300 families. The association had held a protest at the proposed site. According to Dahiya, the shop is being planned at a shopping centre in an area that has three private hospitals, which have also written to the government opposing the move. “Just across the road, we have a Shiv temple and Bhagwan Parshuram Bhawan where religious ceremonies take place,” he added. “Our society will not remain safe, we will have to deploy additional security guards.” Narayan Dutt Lakhera, president of the Sector 2 RWA, claimed that the shop would lead to drinking in nearby parks. “This is a residential area; I will fear sending my children out to play. There will also be a huge rush because of this liquor store,” he added. Manish Chaudhary, councillor of south corporation ward 26, said he had written to the excise department about the residents’ concerns. “We are with the residents. This is a residential area. If the government does not respond, we will sit on protest outside the proposed shop,” he added. “A liquor store should only be in commercial areas. This is a major flaw in the excise policy,” demanded Narendra Chawla, a councillor from Janakpuri that has also protested against the move. No reaction was available from the Delhi government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rohini-rwa-opposes-opening-of-liquor-store/articleshow/87767351.cms||---

The two havildars had taken the original call letter of a candidate, who cleared his Army Ordnance Corps’ examination for multi-tasking staff (MTS) post, on the pretext of early joining formalities and demanded Rs2.5 lakh from him. The CBI said in a release that the two havildars agreed to collect Rs50,000 as an initial payment and even received Rs30,000 through a UPI payment app. A CBI court on Wednesday remanded the two havildars in police custody for five days. The Army Southern Command later issued a press release through the defence PRO stating, “The Indian Army continues with its policy of zero tolerance for corruption. On a recent tip-off about likely malpractice in recruitment of Multi Tasking Assistance/Staff, the Indian Army in Southern Command and CBI in joint investigation are inquiring into the possible malpractices by lower level staff. The army has strict rules to deal with such malpractices and is enabling expeditious investigation to ensure punitive action against the culprits.” In the other case, a civilian gazetted officer of the IAF demanded Rs50,000 and was caught while accepting Rs4,000 from the complainant for considering his mutual transfer request to Dehu Road. He was remanded in two-day police custody. The arrested suspect was produced before the special CBI court, which ordered his remand in police custody for two days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cbi-traps-2-army-havildars-civilian-gazetted-officer/articleshow/87767350.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Jaipur||Enrolment of students in govt schools rose by 11% during pandemic: Report||JAIPUR: The pandemic has brought major gains for government schools in terms of enrolment. It has jumped from 56.7% in 2020 to 68.4% in 2021, says the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) tabled on Wednesday. The report indicates that the rise of 11% in enrolments was due to the shifting of students from private to government schools and the return of migrants. The rise also indicates that government schools have improved on two fronts: the quality of education and infrastructure. Over the years, the state had introduced several categories of specialised schools — Mahatma Gandhi English Medium Schools, Vivekanand Model School, Utkarsh, Adarsh and general schools. Girdhar Singh, principal of a government school in Malpura said, “My senior secondary school is running full capacity in the past four years. Every year, I can give admission to very selected few purely based on merit in all classes. Most of the transfers in my school are from private schools in some cases, students do come from middle-income level schools.” This school comes under the general category, not any specialised school. Like many others, this school was in a dilapidated condition with dwindling enrolments until a few years ago. The Bhamashah scheme (Donors) have changed the fate of many schools forever. The Malpura school saw a complete overhaul due to generous donations by locals, which have attracted the teachers to stay for long leading to students performing well. The astronomical rise of girl students in government schools, which is exclusive to a few states including Rajasthan, owes it to several reward/award-based schemes linked with it. Pratham NGO managing trustee KB Kothari said, “The cash reward schemes for meritorious students like Gargi Purushkar, financial incentive of Rs 51,000 for girls studying from class I till class 12 in government schools, scooty scheme along with construction of functional toilets in all schools has does the magic for government schools.” Figures say that 73.6% of girls have enrolled in government schools is the highest ever and it comes at a time when in a recent report women have recorded worst literacy rate in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/enrolment-of-students-in-govt-schools-rose-by-11-during-pandemic-report/articleshow/87768098.cms||Shoeb Khan
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Goon attacks elderly couple||Thiruvananthapuram: Kazhakootam police have registered a case and launched a hunt for a habitual offender who allegedly vandalised houses and vehicles of his neighbours at Ulloorkonam near Kazhakootam. The police identified the accused as Hashim, a habitual offender involved in around 20 criminal cases on various offences, including ganja peddling and causing hurt. The attack happened twice, around 9.30 pm on Monday and around 2 am on Tuesday. The main complainant, Shiraz, who is a DYFI activist, said that the accused turned up at his residence first around 9.30 pm and threatened to kill his parents Rashid and Ramla. He even grabbed Ramla by her hair and placed a knife on her throat. Shiraz was not at home at that time. Later, he returned again around 2 am and vandalised three houses in the locality, including that of Shiraz. He also vandalised four two wheelers. The complainant also accused Hashim of stealing cash worth around Rs 10,000 from their poultry shop located outside their residence. Shiraz said that though Hashim might have had the help of other criminals in vandalising the houses at the same time. But, they could only see Hashim in action. The police said Hashim suspected Shiraz of informing police about his activities related to ganja peddling and hence he held a grudge on the former. The police added that Hashim’s house and car also reportedly suffered damages. However, it is unclear whether the damages were caused during a counter attack or whether he caused it himself to file a counter case against the complainants. He is suspected to have fled the district after committing the vandalism.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/goon-attacks-elderly-couple/articleshow/87744869.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Day after: Schools tweak routine, rules for safety of kids, teachers||Kolkata: School authorities are thinking on their feet and tweaking schedules and making changes in their facilities to meet practical needs in the new normal. At Heritage School that has day-boarding, the school authorities have decided to operate the dining hall for students and teachers to have their meals. That is a departure from the practice at most of the other schools where canteens have been shut and parents have been told to pack food for students. While the state government had issued a notification for staggered timing, many schools have modified class timings keeping in mind its infrastructure constraints, student turnout and feedback from parents. At South Point, where more than 1,200 students of IX and XI turned up in two halves on Wednesday, theory and practical classes were held simultaneously. In government and government-aided schools where the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education and Higher Secondary Council had issued staggered timing notices, several schools like Hindu, Hare, Sanskrit Collegiate School, Sakhawat Memorial School and Jodhpur Park Boys School have tweaked the schedule as per their infrastructure, both in terms of classrooms and teachers. Sakhawat Memorial School headmistress Papia Nag said the schedule had announced schools on alternate days for students of classes IX-XII and for classes X-XII to ensure there was no infrastructure hurdle. Jodhpur Park Boys School has also prepared a modified routine comprising a three days a-week, alternate-day schedule for students of classes IX and X. In private English-medium schools in the city, attendance was high. At BDM International where CBSE XII term I board exams for financial marketing management was scheduled on Wednesday, attendance was cent percent as was at South City International and DPS New Town where board mock tests were held. At Heritage School, 90% students of Class IX came on Tuesday. On Wednesday, a similar number reported for Class XI. Students of classes X and XII will come on Thursday. In the international block, there was 100% attendance. At South City International School, there was 100% attendance in Class XII on Tuesday and Class X on Wednesday. Both batches appeared for their mock board exams in the school auditorium. Consent for IX and XI batches is at 70% at the moment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/day-after-schools-tweak-routine-rules-for-safety-of-kids-teachers/articleshow/87766486.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Chennai||Before photographs, these drawings served as visual records||Chennai: Social media is flooded with vintage pictures of temples of south India, but have you chanced upon pre-photography day drawings of these places of worship? A year from now, people may be able to view such unseen drawings on digital platforms, which are now not available in the public domain. It was an effort by the British to document the art and sculpture of temples in the Indian sub-continent more than 120 years ago. The drawings are the oldest image documents recorded during the colonial period, decades before temples were photographed by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), custodian of the centrally protected monuments for the purpose. Now, more than a century later, a proposal is in the works to make the images of the scale drawings public.K Amarnath Ramakrishna, ASI superintendent archaeologist, who heads the temple survey project, southern region, said approval has been sought for the digitisation process. "Plans are on to digitise the drawings. After the nod is given, it will take about a year to complete the whole process. We will be putting out these drawings on digital platforms," he told TOI.The treasure trove comprises popular temples in the south of Vindhyas from Maharashtra to Tamil Nadu. It includes Brihadeeswarar temple at Thanjavur, Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple in Madurai and the Pallava monuments in Mamallapuram. The temple survey project of the southern region, a wing of the ASI, based in Chennai is working on a proposal to conserve about 1,000 such scale drawings through digitisation. Each temple had been recreated in multiple dimensions by special draughtsmen using scale drawings, a few dating back to the 1880s. For instance, the Brihadeeshwarar temple at Thanjavur has at least 25 different drawings in various dimensions and angles, capturing almost every architectural detail of the structure.Similarly, several drawings of the Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple in Madurai give an almost-photographic impression of the structure. The wooden doors and sculptures in the Thousand Pillar mandapam from the temple are masterpieces of precision and intricacy.Some of these are big drawings measuring 84x118cm. The sketches are a record of every minute detail regarding the heritage structures including its height.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/before-photographs-these-drawings-served-as-visual-records/articleshow/87767355.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 5 of six vax laggard districts in state better dose coverage within 15 days||Mumbai: Five of the six districts that were pulled up for low first-dose coverage by the Centre have managed to better their performance in the past 15 days. Barring Nandurbar, five districts have managed to give first shots to 60% of their population. However, the single-dose coverage for all continues to be much below the state average (76.7%). The Centre had identified 48 districts in the country that had not vaccinated even 50% of their eligible population with a single shot till October end. Aurangabad (46.5%), Nandurbar (46.9%), Buldhana (47.6%), Hingoli (47.8%), Nanded (48.4%) and Akola (49.3%) had featured on the list. Later, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had met with the district collectors and told them to increase the pace of coverage. Latest data from CoWin showed that till Wednesday, Aurangabad has vaccinated 60.5% with a single shot, Buldhana 64.3%, Hingoli 61.8%, Nanded 61% and Akola 60.4%. Buldhana has been the swiftest, increasing its coverage by 17% in the past 15 days. A district official said that entire Vidarbha region, including Buldhana, has seen a jump in vaccinations due to a slew of measures including restricted entry to official premises, use of public transport, availing of government schemes for the unvaccinated. “Last week, we had vaccinated more than 40,000 on as single day,” the official said. Nandurbar, with a predominant tribal population, is the only district that hasn’t reached 60% first-dose coverage. Dr Sachin Desai, immunisation officer for Maharashtra, said that under the “har ghar dastak” campaign, smaller teams are now targeting every village. An official from Nandurbar said that they have drawn up lists of people from each village and are reaching them accordingly. “There will be camps at banks and market places. Health workers will also travel over Narmada river in boat ambulances to reach villages that are on the banks,” the official said, adding that they are encountering hesitancy among people. Dr Desai said that the state is watching the performance of all districts and not just these six. Apart from Nandurbar, Beed is another district that is lagging and has managed to give a single shot to only 58% people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-5-of-six-vax-laggard-districts-in-state-better-dose-coverage-within-15-days/articleshow/87767373.cms||---
---||Jaipur||‘67% kids have smartphones for online classes in state’||Jaipur: The availability of smartphones with children for online classes at homes has jumped from 40% in 2018 to 67% in 2021 in Rajasthan, says the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER). At the same time, it also means 33% of students do not have phones for online classes. Also, just 21% have access to smartphones all the time, says the report, which roughly translates to 38 lakh considering the total enrolments of 1.79 crore. Educationists are crediting it to the sudden blast of online education in the pandemic year. Online education could have been imparted through laptops or tablets, which have been a privilege for a few, but the only resort for the masses is smartphones to access online education. “Online education has been the best available option in the unprecedented situation. It becomes very important to study the impact of screen time on students age-wise to fully understand its impact,” said Puneet Sharma, an expert on education based in Jaipur. The ASER has not come up with learning outcomes report, which could have given a better picture on how far the smartphones have faired in imparting education. Pranjal Singh, president of Abhyuthanam, working for the education of disadvantaged students said, “In all our inspections in low-income families, we could hardly find student learning through smartphones. The mismatch in the accessibility of smartphones has further divided the gap between the haves and have nots,” said Singh. Pointing out the ill effects of the increasing access to smartphones, RK Gupta, senior professor of paediatrics, Sawai Man Singh Medical College said, “Rising access to smartphones should be taken as an achievement. The uncontrolled use is actually having multiple effects—health, sociological and psychological on children.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/67-kids-have-smartphones-for-online-classes-in-state/articleshow/87768100.cms||---

The recent order of the Supreme Court had mandated the government to increase the period of LoI so that the successful bidders could get environment clearances in time and start mining. The state government issues LoIs to issue mining leases. Leases are granted and signed only after the lessee gets environment clearances.

---||Delhi||Delhi: How even young and healthy are falling prey to pollution||NEW DELHI: A 30-year-old man with no history of respiratory problems had to be admitted to the hospital last week after he complained about acute onset of breathlessness, wheezing and low oxygen levels. Doctors at Aakash Super-Specialty Hospital said tests confirmed that the patient, an IT professional, had eosinophilic asthma, marked by high levels of eosinophil cells. The man had no history of smoking or asthma, doctors said. Dr Akshay Budhraja, a consultant for the pulmonology department at the hospital, said that the poor air quality triggered his illness. “He had no fever or signs of any active infection and no other associated factor that could have caused such symptoms,” he added. Generally, Dr Budhraja said, asthma symptoms are caused by narrowing of the airways due to inflammation. Eosinophilic asthma causes inflammation of the entire respiratory system, from the nose down to the tiniest airway. This inflammation happens due to hyper-responsiveness of the airway due to inhaled allergens or pollutants, he added. The doctor explained that breathing may become more laboured in eosinophilic asthma, and wheezing may get louder. Proper and timely treatment is important to avoid the risk of permanent narrowing of the airways and damage to the lungs. “The patient came to the emergency wing of the hospital with difficulty in breathing about two and a half weeks ago. His blood levels showed eosinophilia, which suggests allergy that caused a flare-up of bronchial asthma due to poor air quality,” Dr Budhraja said, adding that the patient had to be given oxygen therapy, steroids and bronchodilators. A significantly raised eosinophil level, obstructive pattern in the pulmonary function test, raised exhaled nitric oxide level and clinical examination confirmed that the case was a flare-up of eosinophilic asthma. The patient has no history of smoking, asthma or infection, said the pulmonologist. Like this patient, many young persons and even children are being rushed to hospitals with respiratory complications. A senior doctor at Madhukar Rainbow Children’s Hospital said they were getting five to six admissions among children suffering from respiratory complications over the past few days. “Some people are also suffering from anxiety attacks. We have received at least two patients who came with complaints of chest congestion and uneasiness. Tests revealed nothing. Both had recovered from Covid last year,” doctors say.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-even-young-healthy-are-falling-prey-to-pollution/articleshow/87767363.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: BJP, Congress oppose excise policy, hold protests outside new stores||NEW DELHI: Even as restaurateurs and the industry have been rejoicing due to the new excise policy coming into effect, BJP and Congress have opposed the move and started protests outside the new liquor stores. Both parties have accused chief minister Arvind Kejriwal of prioritising alcohol sales over governance or fighting pollution. Adesh Gupta, Delhi BJP president, held a protest rally at Jantar Mantar on Wednesday and asserted that his party would oppose the new policy tooth and nail and not let even a single new liquor store open. “The AAP government has argued that the new excise policy will increase the revenue of the government, but there are several other ways to do it rather than promoting liquor consumption. Instead of ensuring that youths get employment, the CM is pushing them towards alcoholism,” claimed Gupta. Gupta, the councillor from West Patel Nagar, said the new policy had proposed three liquor stores in each ward. “These stores will be opened in residential colonies and neighbourhood markets and cause law and order problems. BJP will lead a jan andolan and oppose opening of every new liquor store,” he added. Leader of Opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said that AAP came to power promising to open new schools, colleges, hospitals, flyovers and water treatment plants, but was instead opening new liquor stores. “The new excise policy will make the atmosphere bad for women and girls and they will not feel safe,” he alleged. Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee (DPCC) president Anil Kumar Chaudhary and his party workers protested near Chawri Bazar Metro Station. “Delhi has a high unemployment rate. In such a situation, the AAP government has implemented the new excise policy to allow free flow of liquor that will ruin the life of youths. We will continue to protest against it,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-cong-oppose-excise-policy-hold-protests-outside-new-stores/articleshow/87767388.cms||Amin Ali

The police identified the accused as Ananthu, 22, of Kunnappuzha near Thirumala. The incident related to the case took place on October 18. A police team comprising members of Karamana police station and city anti-narcotic cell were attacked by the gang using crude explosives when the former raided a tourist home at Killipalam to catch the gang. The gang members were hiding in a room on the third floor of the tourist home. While the police managed to nab two, including a minor aged 17, from the spot. They also seized five kilograms of ganja, small quantity of synthetic drug MDMA and dangerous weapons such as three air pistols and two machetes from their room.

---||Kolkata||Stress on practical classes to plug gaps left behind by 20 months of online teaching||Kolkata: Though most schools taught students successfully in the online mode, there is a huge backlog as far as practical lab-based parts of the syllabus is concerned for classes XI and XII. Hence, schools are gearing up to address the issue now. Almost in all schools, Class XI students are being put through a regimen of laboratory sessions so that they get hands-on training in the experiments that they are supposed to perform. Learning gaps have also developed in subjects like geography, economics, accountancy and geometry and co-ordinate geometry, according to teachers. So, in-person classes will first address these portions of the syllabus. Map pointing, for example, is an area where teachers have tried their best to mark the maps and send pictures on WhatsApp groups for children to practice at home. But minute errors remain since teachers did not get a chance to look at kids’ work and correct them. “Now teachers will have an opportunity to help children individually in the class,” said Rupa Sanyal Bhattacharjee, principal of South Point High School. Geometry is one area where kids have been struggling to cope with concepts and schools felt that theorems and their logical applications on figures can never be fully explained in the online mode. “Construction and applications in geometry need a lot of hand-holding. So we kept geometry to be done in the end hoping that schools would re-open,” said a maths teacher. On Wednesday, as Class XI students of South Point High School came in, they went straight to the labs. At The Heritage School, too, Class XI students spent the day in the labs. “No online video can train children to identify colour change of chemicals they are experimenting with. They have to heat the chemicals and see the change and record it themselves. We are starting intense lab training now to fill the gap. In physics again, for example, how can you only theoretically teach parallax error, unless a child observes it in the lab?” reasoned principal Seema Sapru. At La Martiniere for Boys, the IX and XI science classes are happening in the labs so that teachers can club theory and practical teaching. “Class IX has come into school straight after Class VII, so for them the transition has been very big and hence the lab experience will help them understand concepts better,” said John Stephen, acting principal. Students of Class XI at South City International School will also be put through intense practical lab sessions from Monday. “Those in Class XII who will be writing their month-long ISC semester one exam from Monday. We will give them lab training immediately after the exams are over,” said principal John Bagul.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/stress-on-practical-classes-to-plug-gaps-left-behind-by-20-months-of-online-teaching/articleshow/87766496.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Kolkata||High turnout at colleges, but hybrid classes to continue||Kolkata: The high turnout in most colleges and universities to attend offline classes after the reopening on November 16 will not impact the hybrid class routine. Authorities have decided to call the students in a staggered manner, either prioritising them based on seniority or on lab-based subjects. Many colleges have divided the students in smaller groups and are calling them in different time slots to attend classes and use the labs. Those who are unable to come can attend the same classes online. Classrooms have been equipped with live-streaming facilities. At St Xavier’s College, most of the subjects have registered attendance of over 70%. “I spoke to the students personally and asked if they were comfortable coming to the campus and all of them said they were happy to be back. We are anyway continuing with hybrid and online classes for those who have not been called to the campus yet,” said Father Dominic Savio, principal of St Xavier’s College. “Mainly practical classes are taking place offline and students’ response is remarkably good. Other classes are taking place online. Students are free to visit campus as per their requirements,” said a professor of Presidency University. “On an average, we have registered 95%-97% attendance in different subjects in the last two days. Senior students have shown more enthusiasm in coming to the college. We have divided the students of each semester in smaller groups and provided different time slots,” said Krishna Roy, principal of Bethune College. At Maulana Azad College, too, students have shown enthusiasm in returning to the campus. Attendance in different subjects ranged from 70% to 90%, said principal Subhasis Dutta. “Few departments have started classes with limited students and the response is quite good. Research scholars are doing their lab works. Last-minute cleaning and repairing is going on in different labs because maximum departments are going to start from November 22 according to their schedules. The real picture will be available thereafter,” said Jadavpur University registrar Snehamanju Basu. At Seth Anandram Jaipuria College, the attendance has been above 80% in many subjects. “We have three shifts and the attendance in all the subjects has been good. We are calling students in a staggered manner,” said Asok Mukhopadhyay, principal of the college. Almost 100% students have turned up for practical classes at Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Centenary College, Rahara. “We have assigned one day each to students from each semester for practical classes.

---||Vadodara||Tagged greylag goose draws many to protected wetland||Vadodara: While hundreds of greylag geese have descended on the Wadhwana wetlands in Dabhoi, one of them is drawing many bird lovers to the sprawling lake. A greylag goose with a satellite tag has been spotted in the lake that sees an influx of thousands of migratory birds in winter. “It was spotted first by a forest beat guard some days ago. The goose has a tag around its neck and as per the experts it seemed to be tagged in Mongolia. It is for the first time that a grey lag goose tagged in Mongolia has been spotted at Wadhwana,” said Kartik Upadhyay, an avid bird watcher, who photographed the goose along with Rahul Bhatt and Ravi Patel. “The bird flew over China and crossed north-east India and covered about 3,800km to reach Gujarat. It is the third time that a tagged greylag goose from Mongolia has been spotted in the state,” Upadhyay told TOI. In December last year, a tagged greylag goose was spotted at Nal Sarovar and in February this year, the same individual bird was seen at Navatalav wetland in Surendranagar. Ornithologist Devvratsinh Mori, who had photographed the bird in Surendranagar, had said that the goose was tagged in Mongolia. The Mongolia Conservation Centre that tags the geese keeps a tab on their movement and location. The Conservation Centre of Mongolia is involved with an international bird migration study. Upadhyay, however, said that it is difficult to ascertain if the goose seen at Wadhwana is the same that was spotted at Nal Sarovar and Surendranagar. When asked why these geese fly all the way from Mongolia to Gujarat, Upadhyay said, “The state has a good number of wetlands where these geese find an ideal habitat. Also, enough food is available for the migratory birds apart from safe environs here. It is good news that geese from Mongolia are now flying all the way to Wadhwana too,” Upadhyay added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/tagged-greylag-goose-draws-many-to-protected-wetland/articleshow/87766349.cms||Tushar Tere

The police identified the accused as Vishnu, 25, of Kalippankulam near Manacaud. The police said that the accused created a fake account on social media using the images and name of his own wife and established a friendship with the complainant, who resided at Nedumangad. He used to chat with the complainant and gained his trust. He then invited the complainant to the city in the guise of meeting in person. The complainant turned up at Attukal temple ground as per their plans. But, instead of his lady friend, the complainant was welcomed by Vishnu and his friends, who forcefully took him to a secluded spot near Iranimuttom in their vehicle. They beat him and robbed his money, gold ornaments and the registration certificate of his motorcycle. The police had arrested four others in connection with the case a week ago. Vishnu, who was hiding at the coastal village of Adimalathura was caught a day ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/main-accused-in-mugging-case-arrested/articleshow/87744875.cms||---

More than Rs 100 crore is pending with various government departments and the public.Many water bills are pending for the last 10 years. During the campaign, people will be given an option to either pay the bills on the spot when officers go to collect it or their water connections will be cut within a few days. Manish Beniwal, additional chief engineer of PHED said, “During the campaign, we will visit people’s houses and give them notice. They have to pay on the spot or else a warning notice will be given to them. If they still do not abide, their connection will be cut a few days later.” Since the department is severely understaffed, a tender has been floated to hire contract workers to disconnect the waterlines. Contract workers along with PHED officials will visit each and every defaulter’s house to cut connections. For the last two years, there is a ban on disconnecting water connections of people who haven’t paid their bills.TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/phed-pay-water-bills-or-risk-losing-connection/articleshow/87768103.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Mandatory Marathi subject: Edu officials to compile Nagpur schools’ list||Nagpur: After the state government’s letter to fine schools that have not yet introduced Marathi as a mandatory subject, local education officials have started planning out their future course of action. Vaishali Jamdar, Nagpur division’s deputy director of education, told TOI that she has informed officers in all six districts under her purview to proceed as per provisions of the law. Last year, the state legislature passed the Maharashtra Compulsory Teaching and Learning of Marathi Language Act, which made binding on other board-affiliated schools to also introduce Marathi in their curriculum. Schools face a fine of Rs1 lakh if the subject has not been introduced. Jamdar said, “As soon as we received the letter from the state education director, district level officials were informed about the need to follow through with the action. Once their enquiry is complete, they will be sending me a report, based on which further action will be decided.” The introduction of Marathi subject is to be done in a phased manner till 2024. For the current session, Std I-II and Std VI-VII need to have Marathi as a mandatory subject. Sources in the district education office told TOI that as of now, information will have to come from schools on a ‘voluntary’ basis. “There is no way we can visit every single school when their Marathi class is on. In fact, it is not possible even if we had decided to visit institutions because across Maharashtra, Std I-II are closed. And Std VI-VII are open only in rural areas,” said an official. The education department is now going to resort to its preferred mode of communication, dispatching a notice or circular. “We will send these letters to all schools through our taluka level officials in which they shall be asked whether or not Marathi is a mandatory subject in these specific classes,” said the officer. Quite a few schools have not introduced the subject, but with information being sought on a voluntary basis, they may ‘misrepresent facts’ to escape action. The official, however, felt that no school would take such a risk. “They are committing to something in writing, and if it’s not the truth, they can be in serious trouble,” said the official. It’s expected that the entire information will be collected within two to three weeks and a report is sent to education department’s headquarters in Pune.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mandatory-marathi-subject-edu-officials-to-compile-nagpur-schools-list/articleshow/87767381.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The steep 36,000 rise in passenger count once again proved that Metro has become the primary means of commute for students, teachers and guardians. Metro’s north-south corridor clocked 3,34,345 passengers on Tuesday. The carrier had already advanced its starting time by half-an-hour from Monday and added six trains, running just 16 short of its pre-pandemic fleet of 288. Even as Metro had breached the 3.5lakh ridership on Sashthi (October 11) with 3,77,761 riders, daily passenger count has hovered around 3lakh over the past few weeks. On Monday, despite extended operational hours and added services, footfall on the Kavi Subhas-Dakshineswar stretch was around 2,97,000. On Tuesday, the count shot to 3,34,345 overnight. On Tuesday Metro sold 9,568 smartcards against Monday’s 8,764. Till 2pm on Wednesday, 5,300 new smartcards were issued. However, authorities are worried as around 4,000 commuters are returning smartcards daily. “People must understand that smartcards are the safest and most useful means of ticketing,”said Metro’s DGM Protyush Ghosh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/campus-reopening-pushes-up-metro-passenger-count/articleshow/87766517.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Bareilly||Uttar Pradesh: Man held for picking up destitute kids from Moradabad railway station||BAREILLY: A man claiming to be the "driver" of a city-based exporter has been arrested after he was spotted driving around suspiciously with four poor children, three girls and a boy, near the Moradabad railway station. Three women who stopped the car discovered that the kids, all destitute, were alleged victims of sexual assault. Shocking revelations soon tumbled out. The children told the women that the man visited them often and gave them things to eat, sometimes sedatives, took them with him to various locations and showed them inappropriate videos, asking them to perform similar acts. The women lodged a complaint at the Kotwali police station but the man was interrogated and let off. It was only when the women put a video of the car's interception on social media triggering outrage that police swung into action. SSP Bablu Kumar took cognisance and registered an FIR under sections 376 (rape), 294 (obscene acts and songs), 328 (causing hurt by means of poison), and 363 (kidnapping) of the IPC, along with sections 3,4,11 and 12 of Pocso (Prevention of Children from Sexual Offenses) Act. Police have formed four teams to identify other victims and are trying to trace the car's owner. Mahanagar general secretary of BJP, Hema Khatri, who was one of the three women who stopped the car with the children, said, “We had immediately called up the police and informed them about the incident. According to information from locals, the man used to frequently visit and take the kids along with him. Nobody reported it. Perhaps they were afraid.” Several such incidents in UP have come to light in the past. Twenty-four girls were rescued from the Maa Vindhyavasini Mahila and Balika Sanrakshan Griha shelter home in Deoria amid allegations of sexual exploitation. The issue had come to light after an 11-year-old girl fled from the home. During the investigation, it was discovered that the girls were drugged and made to entertain "powerful guests" in exchange for money. The CBI eventually took over the case in which an NGO was running the shelter home. In a similar incident, the CBI had arrested an official in the UP irrigation department in November 2020 for allegedly sexually exploiting children and peddling their videos and photographs on the dark web. The accused, Ram Bhawan, had allegedly exploited at least 50 children in the 15-16 year age group over the past 10 years in Chitrakoot, Banda, and Hamirpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-arrested-for-picking-up-destitute-kids-from-up-rly-stn-raping-them/articleshow/87766499.cms||Maria Khan
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘Keep testing even in areas with zero, low positivity’||Pune: Local authorities have been directed to maintain the Covid testing momentum in areas with zero weekly positivity or that below the state average of 1.35% to keep the infection’s spread at its lowest. Last week, Gondia and Nandurbar registered a zero positivity rate while 22 other districts across the state recorded less than 100 cases. “The number of active cases has been in the range of 800-1,000 over the past fortnight. Many districts need to scale up testing too,” said a state health department official. During the Diwali week, weekly testing numbers had halved to about 5.5 lakh as against 10-11 lakh tests as usually done. State task force members said even as the numbers were going down, it was necessary for these districts to prevent any new cases. “While cases are down, there should be no laxity in testing. There is a need to scale up testing in all these districts,” said task force member Dr Rahul Pandit. Dharavi has seen 37 days of zero infections since the second wave. However, that does not mean that such pockets should be ignored, said doctors. “Continuous testing is the only way to avoid any sudden rise in cases,” said a health official from Mumbai. In the cabinet note last week, nearly 22 districts registered less than 100 active cases, with the lowest numbers recorded from Nandurbar and Washim. However, it was found that the weekly testing in these districts too has become dismal. “In the Diwali week, weekly testing was less than 500 for Nandurbar and it was just 528 for Washim. Nearly seven districts registered weekly testing below 1,000,” said another health official. Public health expert and former state health director Dr P P Doke told TOI the state is in a crucial phase as there is barely any rise in cases despite restrictions being lifted around Diwali. Dr Doke, though, cautioned against letting down one’s guard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-keep-testing-even-in-areas-with-zero-low-positivity/articleshow/87767387.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Also, the fair has gradually turned into a market due to a venue change.As the devotees coming to the religious fair have to travel 2km to reach the new venue, Motisar Road, the cattle fair is being attended mostly by buyers and sellers, who are essentially farmers from Punjab, Haryana, and Gujarat.Satya Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Ludhiana, said there were no basic facilities for water and cleaning available in the new cattle fairground. Another farmer, Manjeet Singh from Punjab’s Hoshiarpur, said they were provided with the space, but no food or other amenities.The administration said they got the permission to organise the fair too late and were unable to prepare the new ground for the fair. The old fairground had turned into a private property and the administration decided to shift the fair to Motisar Road, they said.Camels are no longer the attraction of Pushkar cattle fair and horses are participating in large numbers. "Horses costing Rs 25 crore to Rs 90,000 are available in the fair, but the traders are from other states," said Suresh Kumawat, a camel-cart owner. Camels can be spotted as camel-carts had been brought for tourists. But this time, even the footfall of tourists is less. "Not even local tourists have come in. Those who come for the religious fair, reside in dharamshalas," said a hotel owner.The cattle fairground on Wednesday was like a cattle mart, where only trade and checking of animals were seen, "As the camel has been made the state anima, people fear to purchase camel. Also, there is fear of transporting camel outside the state," said a middleman of the cattle business.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/not-camels-horses-steal-show-at-pushkar-fair/articleshow/87768107.cms||---

Gehlot said on Tuesday that the cabinet reshuffle in the state will take place soon. Speaking to reporters in Bhilwara on Wednesday, Pilot said there are vacancies in the government as well as in the party organisation and we will have to move forward with a combination of experience and youth. Pilot said that youths and workers on the ground will have to be empowered. "When they realise that they have full participation in the government, then definitely we will be forming the government in 2023 again." Pilot, who was the Rajasthan Pradesh Congress Committee chief during the rule of the former BJP government led by Vasundhara Raje, said, “Time flies. During the previous BJP government's rule, we struggled on the road against the BJP government because there was no one in the government to hear us. That was the government of arrogance and we have to set an example contrary to it. We are working in that direction,” he said. The Congress leader said he is fighting for those who struggled for the party and its victory in the elections. "If we make them participate in the government, it will be good for the party and the state as well. Youths will have new energy. Everyone has accepted this and the result will be visible in the days to come,” he said. Asked about teachers telling the chief minister on Tuesday that money has to be given for transfers, Pilot said the CM has already promised that a transfer policy will be made. He said that transparency should be there in all departments, and not in just one. "When we were in opposition, we exposed the corruption of the BJP government. People trusted us and gave us votes." He also targeted the centre over issues of inflation and unemployment. Pilot said the Congress is the only alternative to BJP at the national level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pilot-bats-for-experience-youth-in-govt-and-party/articleshow/87768106.cms||---

Health officials said the doctor, who was on duty on November 11, had allegedly asked his colleague to perform the autopsy ‘due to his busy schedule’. The latter did conduct the autopsy but failed to hand the report to the family. When asked what led to the delay, CMO, Sambhal, Dr Ajay Kumar Saxena, said the doctor was contacted but he said he had not done the autopsy. Suspecting a foul play in the case, the CMO registered a complaint with Sambhal Police. Speaking to TOI, he said, “Dr Khilendra Saxena had performed the postmortem. Two other doctors, too, visited the mortuary the same night, as per the sweeper’s account. To corroborate the sweeper’s claim, Dr Khilendra Saxena was contacted but he, too, said he had not conducted the autopsy.” Following this, the CMO said that he was left with no option but to but initiate legal action as the delay in autopsy report was hampering police investigation too. “I have complained against all four people, including three doctors. We tried contacting Dr Khilendra Saxena but he is not resonding.” Inspector, Bahjoi police station, Sambhal, Ajay Singh, said, “An FIR under various IPC section,s including 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant, or agent) and 120B (punishment of criminal conspiracy) has been registered against Dr Khilendra Saxena, Dr Souvir Singh, Dr Raj Kishore and a sweeper.

That could have solved all the problems and also raised the revenues of the state government. We could have got back the business we are losing to Punjab and Haryana,” said Suneet Bagai, president of the association. He said the dealers are also taking huge losses because of the reduction on excise duty by the Centre and the VAT by the state. “We have written to the Union petroleum minister to give the dealers some relief,” added Bagai.If the state had brought down the rates at par with Punjab, it would have increased demand for diesel in the state and also brought down rates of several goods and services. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/despite-vat-cut-raj-will-still-lose-biz-to-neighbouring-states/articleshow/87768112.cms||---

While rejecting the apology, the top court has given all the office bearers, including the president and general secretary, time till November 26 to submit fresh affidavits and resolutions. The court also refused to grant exemption to office bearers from personal appearance.The association had given a call to boycott the judge on September 27 after he rejected demand of a lawyer to hear a case involving him at once. The association then passed a resolution to boycott the judge till his roster was changed. The Supreme Court, taking strong exemption in the case, said only by the actions of such lawyers, the legal profession had lost its respect.The court while hearing a suo motu petition on the matter said, “We have a dire need to improve the level of advocacy in the country. This is not the case of a one association. More or less the same is the case with the entire judicial system of the country,” observed Justice M R Shah and Justice Sanjiv Khanna during a long hearing of the case while rejecting the apology and the affidavit of the Bar association president Bhuvnesh Sharma and general secretary Giriraj Prasad Sharma. Justice Sanjiv Khanna observed that “this is a serious issue, showing its seriousness, all the Bar office bearers have to give an affidavit apologising separately for the mistake done at every level. Affidavits of president and secretary alone will not work.”The court added, “This court is also the guardian of all courts of the country. The seriousness of the case cannot be reduced by accepting an apology. This court has from time to time called strikes and boycotts as unconstitutional, but most of the Bar associations was making fun of our orders.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Why ban on thermal plants may not lead to power crisis||NEW DELHI: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) issued directions on Tuesday to shut down six of the 11 thermal power plants within a 300-km radius of Delhi. Even though the city depends heavily on thermal power, sources said the direction to temporarily close these power plants wouldn’t affect life because the demand currently was low and manageable. On Tuesday, CAQM said only five power plants would be allowed to operate and the rest would remain inoperative at least till November 30. Out of the five, three are located in Haryana’s Jhajjar and Panipat districts and two in Rajpura and Mansa in Punjab. “Secretary, ministry of power, informed that load requirements, if any, arising out of such closures shall be duly facilitated through power supply from other power plants located beyond 300-km radius of Delhi,” stated CAQM’s directions. Sources said that the need to source power from plants located further away might not arise at all. According to officials, the demand for electricity in Delhi at present is low, as is normal for the winter months. After a peak demand of more than 7,300MW at one point in the summer, the demand slid to around 4,562MW in October and is currently below the 4,000MW mark. Officials assured that even if the power demand in the city rose, it could be sourced from many different power plants across the country. While the power distribution companies buy electricity at Rs 5.5-6 per unit as part of long-term arrangements, they also buy from other sources when needed. While CAQM has directed the temporary closure of six of the 11 thermal power plants near Delhi in view of the air pollution crisis, Delhi’s power minister Satyendar Jain had written to Union power minister R K Singh in October last year, urging him to shut down the thermal power plants operating in the National Capital Region. Jain had argued that the biggest contributors to Delhi pollution were the thermal power plants around the city. He had pointed out that in a bid to bring down the pollution levels in the capital, Delhi government had shut down the Indraprastha power plant in 2009, Rajghat power plant in 2015 and the Badarpur power plant in 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-ban-may-not-lead-to-a-power-crisis/articleshow/87767402.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Delhi||Delhi: Stay on Janakpuri liquor shop following residents’ petition||NEW DELHI: A court has put an interim stay on opening a liquor shop in a residential area in Janakpuri. Civil Judge Vaishali Singh had on November 15 said prima facie a case was made out and directed not to open the shop at a flat till the next date of hearing. The company, which has been granted the licence to run the liquor shop in Janakpuri West, has obtained the flat of one Ajay Arora on lease, the suit filed by the residents welfare association stated. It claimed the news of the opening of a liquor shop had caused an alarm and a situation of fear and panic in the mind of residents. “The block A5B/A5C shares a common boundary with a huge public park (maintained by the DDA), which accommodates many budding sportspersons and athletes of the society and the nearby areas. Many young children and adolescents also regularly visit the park. It is worth mentioning here that the property mentioned above is likely to cause nuisance within the radius of less than 50 metres of the park,” the suit, moved through advocate Abhimanyu Lall and Mohit Rana, claimed. It further claimed that the property in question was at a critical location with more than three schools and various coaching institutions. “It is pertinent to mention here that the property in question and the schools share various public parks, which are used by the students of the schools and coaching institutions after study hours,” it stated. “The opening of the liquor shop may severely cause a very bad impact upon the mind of students as it is well established that wherever there is a liquor shop nearby some park or playground, there are higher chances that the people who purchases liquor tries to carve the opportunity to consume the alcoholic products at such places where they may not be suspected,” the RWA plea stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/stay-on-janakpuri-liquor-shop-following-residents-petition/articleshow/87767415.cms||---

The programme, organised by Pune’s Chest Research and Training Private Limited (CREST), screened 2,440 patients in the OPDs of the hospitals. CREST director Dr Sundeep Salvi told TOI, “Out of the 2,440 patients, 269 (11%) were found to have COPD, of which 201 were men and 67 were women. Nearly 161 of these were smokers, the findings revealed. In some medical colleges, one in every six patients screened had COPD and in others, every fourth patient had the disease.” In Jaipur, Rajasthan and Ujjain, every third patient visiting the OPD of the medical colleges as part of the study had COPD, he said. The screening programme was organised as part of the World COPD Day on November 17. During the five-day programme, every patient visiting the chest department was tested for COPD using a tool comprising a set of eight questions and a peak flow meter test. The ones who screened positive took a spirometry test that was performed by the Breathe Free educator team of Cipla. The treating doctor then examined those found positive on the spirometry. The final diagnosis of COPD was based on spirometry and by the treating doctor in the medical college. Colleges from Maharashtra where patients were screened were Pune-based Bharati Vidyapeeth and Kashibai Navale. Chest Research and Training Private Limited (CREST) director Dr Sundeep Salvi said COPD patients are likely to have very severe Covid-19 when they catch the infection. “COPD patients, thus, have to be protected from catching Covid-19 with stringent protocols such as hand hygiene, masking, social distancing being very important for such patients,” he said.  COPD is a chronic, progressive lung disease with intermittent periods of exacerbations, called lung attacks, that can often be fatal. “It is caused by long-term exposure to noxious pollutants that causes damage to the breathing tubes and the gas exchange portion of the lung. Tobacco smoking in any form, household air pollution from burning of biomass fuels for cooking purposes, burning of mosquito coils, long-term exposure to ambient air pollution from motor vehicular exhausts, industry smoke, road dust, and working in dusty workplaces for many years are the risk factors associated with COPD ,” he said. According to experts, COPD can be diagnosed with the help of a test called spirometry, yet many doctors or hospitals across India do not have this test. Thus, many COPD cases remain undiagnosed or wrongly diagnosed, leading to undertreatment and wrong treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/11-patients-screened-in-44-medical-college-hospitals-had-copd-study/articleshow/87767401.cms||---

A counsel appointed by the district legal service authority to represent the victims told the court that one of the two daughters of the migrant family, which was selling footwear in Kochi, informed this to him. Based on the submission, Justice Devan Ramachandran directed that this should also be investigated along with the other allegations against the police team involved in the case. The mother of the girl had earlier alleged that an ASI had demanded Rs 5 lakh to go to Delhi and trace the missing girl and had booked her two sons for raping their sister when the family couldn’t pay up. The missing girl had later informed the court through legal services authority that she was pressurized into giving statement against her brothers. The family had also alleged that they were forced to purchase flight tickets for the five-member police team. The court also pointed out that the police team could not have gone to Delhi without informing a controlling authority as per law and asked to explain, by December 2, how the controlling authority thought expenses for the Delhi trip would be met. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/missing-girl-case-hc-orders-probe-into-allegation-against-asi/articleshow/87767400.cms||---

The police, on the basis of forensic evidence, have also given a clean chit to the constable who was found sleeping next to the crime spot and was the prime suspect. Meerut senior superintendent of police (SSP) Prabhakar Chaudhary told TOI that the accused, Vishal Gupta, 22, is the son of the victim’s maternal aunt and they had known each other since childhood. “The accused had requested the girl to click a selfie with him, but she refused. He then asked her to meet him in private saying he wanted to discuss some important matter with her. He then took her to room number 2, which was vacant. Once inside, he initially tried to take a selfie with her but soon made advances to her and she kept on resisting him. The girl then told him that she needed to use the washroom, but before she could lock the door from inside, Vishal pushed the door open and attempted to molest her,” said the SSP. When the girl told Vishal that she would shout and tell the family about his acts, he tried to gag her with his hands. She soon fell unconscious and died, said the SSP. “The accused initially thought she is unconscious and tried to rape her by removing her clothes, only to find that she was menstruating,” the SSP added. Vishal then ran out of the room, and he was the first person to accuse the constable of murdering the girl and beat him up, said police. He was also among the people who took the body to hospital and remained with the family until the cremation. The girl, who was preparing for CA, was a bright student and had secured 85% in 12th board exam. Her father runs a grocery store, and her elder brother is pursuing MBA. SSP Chaudhary said the constable, who was found sleeping in the room adjacent to the toilet, is innocent and that he was an invitee. “He slept in the room and never went to the washroom where the body was found lying on the floor. We have all the evidence to prove that he is not guilty,” said the SSP.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Focus on Banabitan clean-up after Salt Lake dengue spike||KOLKATA: With the number of dengue cases on a rise in and around Salt Lake area, the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) has sent a letter to the Banabitan authorities in Salt Lake, asking them to clear the overgrown weeds inside the park and keep the premises clean to prevent mosquito breeding. Civic authorities said people, who regularly take their morning stroll inside the 70-acre green space, have complained of unkempt bushes and hyacinths in the waterbody. These are ideal breeding place for aedes aegypti mosquito, which transmits dengue. BMC authorities had recently inspected the Karunamoyee bus terminus complex located adjacent to Central Park where mosquito larvae was found. A Banabitan official, however, said that they have also sent a letter to the civic authorities, informing that rubbish from the adjacent fair ground is often dumped inside the Banabitan complex. “We regularly do cleaning work with help of the civic authorities but some rubbish often gets dumped inside Banabitan premises. Also hyacinths that can be seen are used for generating compost. Till now, there has been no report of any staff being affected by dengue,” said an official. Local residents said that the late surge of dengue in the township have been a cause of concern. “I have heard that quite a few people staying in and around Karunamoyee are getting infected by dengue. Being a regular morning walker and staying close to Central Park, the apprehension of being bitten by mosquito is always on my mind. It will be good if the area is cleaned,”said Surajit Maji, a school teacher and resident of FD block. “Regular vector control steps have been taken in the last two years due to stress on Covid management. Hopefully, the cleaning of Banabitan along with regular larvicide spraying will help prevent spike in dengue cases,” said Tamal Pal, a resident of HB block. BMC areas have seen a spike in cases in the last one and half months, with over 200 cases reported across Salt Lake and Rajarhat since October 1. The number of cases were very low till end of September this year when about 25 cases were reported. According to civic authorities, out of the fresh dengue cases, about 60% have been reported from Salt Lake and most of them live around Karunamoyee and Central Park area. A 33-year-old woman recently died of dengue in Baguiati area, becoming the first victim to fall prey in BMC area this year. “We will warn people if stagnant water and mosquito larvae is found in their premises. If they fail to comply, a notice will be put up at the house for neighbours to be aware,” said a BMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/focus-on-banabitan-clean-up-after-salt-lake-dengue-spike/articleshow/87766527.cms||Suman Chakraborti

On Tuesday, the Calcutta High Court asked the state government to ensure all Covid norms are followed during Christmas and New Year celebrations. Christmas celebrations at Bow Barracks, which continue for over a week with several functions and programmes, attract thousands of people from across the city. Last year, the association had barred entry of outsiders owing to the pandemic but still several people turned up on December 23, 24 and 25. “Normally, we firm up our Christmas plans by this time of the year, but we want to be sure of the Covid situation before taking a final decision. Covid has not gone and after every festival, we have witnessed a spike in the number of cases. The Christmas celebrations at Bow Barracks attract people from far and wide and we do not want to take any chances for the safety of the residents of Bow Barracks. There will definitely be Christmas celebrations but if it will be open to everybody or just for the residents will be decided depending on the Covid situation,” said Angela Govindraj, the secretary of the Bow Barracks Residents’ Welfare Association. Bow Barracks was built as Garrisons’ mess in 1918 for the accommodation of soldiers during World War I but they refused to move in. When Kolkata Improvement Trust was expanding Central Avenue and roads leading to it, several displaced Anglo-Indian families were rehabilitated in Bow Barracks. “Last year, we had limited the celebrations to local residents, but hundreds of people still came and it became difficult to control the crowd. So, we have decided to wait and watch before taking a final decision,” said a resident of Bow Barracks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bow-barracks-christmas-no-decision-on-visitors-yet/articleshow/87766528.cms||Zeeshan Javed

With this, the state has covered nearly 78% of its eligible population with a single dose. Maharashtra is second only to UP that has administered the highest single doses in the country (10.3crore). “Now, more than 7 crore people in Maharashtra have received at least one dose of Covid vaccine. Maharashtra crossed this milestone today at 4pm. The number of fully vaccinated persons is 3.5 crore,” said Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary (health). Of the state’s eligible population of 9.1 crore, 38% have got both shots and are fully vaccinated. While the state is positive about meeting its target of giving its entire adult population at least one dose by November 30 — a soft deadline set by CM Uddhav Thackeray, the daily vaccination turnout is not holding much promise. Vaccinating everyone would mean covering more than 2 crore people in the next 13 days. To achieve that, the state has to clock nearly 14 lakh vaccinations daily. However, the daily footfall in the vaccination centres is half of that, around 6.5-7 lakh. Further, more people are coming for their second doses than the first shot. Dr Sachin Desai, the state’s immunisation officer, said the numbers have jumped since the Diwali slump. “Even if we can push up to 10 lakh doses daily, we will be close to that goal,” he said. Mumbai is also witnessing a drop in vaccination. On Wednesday, 57,742 people got vaccinated at the civic centres. Of these, nearly 45,000 took the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-crosses-7cr-milestone-on-vax-drive-2nd-only-to-up/articleshow/87767436.cms||---

The police stall soon became a centre of attraction among devotees congregating at Bijnor’s ghats to partake in the holy dip. According to an official estimate, five lakh people are expected to assemble at the place. SP (Bijnor) Dharmveer Singh said, “We have taken a leaf out of the Indian Army’s book and organised this exhibition. The display of police weapons of this standard will not only increase confidence among the general masses but also instil a sense of fear among criminals.” On Wednesday, day one of the fair, hundreds of devotees visited the exhibition and tried their hands at various weapons. “They came to the weapons. Policemen here not only helped them understand the role of these arms in different operations, but also provided the visitors information about the initiatives taken by our department for their safety and security," the SP said. Eight-year-old Janis, a resident of Rambagh village, who visited the exhibition along with her father Rupesh Kumar, said, “Police said that the weapons are for our safety, and they are our friends.” Inaugurated on Tuesday evening, the four-day fair will culminate after the Ganga snan when the sun sets on November 19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/in-a-1st-up-police-displays-weapons-at-pilgrimage-site-says-to-instil-fear-in-criminals/articleshow/87766593.cms||Harveer Dabas

The bike was unveiled at the Shola Utsav, a workshop on conservation of Sholas of Karnataka, organised by KWD on Wednesday. The institute has collaborated with KWD to design the e-vehicle that will help forest personnel during patrolling or reach a spot quickly in case of an emergency. The total cost of the forest e-bike is around Rs 1.5 lakh and it is funded by NITK and alumni. Mass production could reduce the cost of the bike to Rs 1 lakh. “The objective of this particular association is to empower personnel with e-mobility to commute around the forest region,” said KV Gangadharan, coordinator, Centre for System Design (CSD), NITK Surathkal. He said the forest e-bike is powered by a BLDC motor of 2K Watt, 72 Volts 33Ah lithium-ion battery. The battery can also be charged using solar power. The solar charging set up includes two 400W mono-crystalline solar panels and 1.5KW UPS unit for charging. The charging time is typically 3-4 hours. Fast charging is possible in 10 amps. Pruthviraj U, assistant professor, who assisted the project along with others said VidYug 4.0 stays true to being renewable, green and sustainable and definitely lives up to the expectation of being a unique e-bike to be used in rough forest terrains. The solar charging station becomes a necessity deep inside the national park region near anti-poaching camps and watchtowers as there won’t be access to other sources of power to charge the battery. Unique features The bike comes with a removable headlight which doubles up as a torch. This headlight includes a built-in battery and a switch. The headlight will charge along with the vehicle battery. The bike’s front utility box can be used to store work accessories of forest officials like walkie-talkie and books. It also has charging docks to charge the walkie-talkie and mobile phone. There is also a provision to carry water into deep forest areas customized easily to unload jerry cans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/nitk-designs-forest-e-bike-for-kudremukh-national-park/articleshow/87765748.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

Hearing a matter relating to Ganga pollution, a three-judge bench comprising Justice Manoj Kumar Gupta, Justice Siddhartha Varma and Justice Ajit Kumar said, “We notice that different departments, nodal and executing agencies are represented through different counsels and amongst whom there is no coordination, resulting in a lot of confusion. If the additional advocate general is representing the state, we expect that he should have full instructions, at least in respect of all matters falling under the purview of state government or its instrumentalities.” Regarding purity of Ganga water, the court observed that “the report from IIT, Kanpur is still awaited and we have been informed that there is a request for some more time being granted to enable it to complete the tests and submit the desired report”. “We accept the request and permit submission of the report in sealed cover through the registrar general of this court by the next date,” the court added while fixing December 6, 2021 for further hearing of the matter. “The other two reports from Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board and IIT, BHU shall remain in sealed cover and shall be opened on the next date along with the report of IIT, Kanpur,” the court further added. The court was not satisfied with the approach of Nagar Nigam, Prayagraj regarding cremation on the bank of river Ganga and said, “We do not appreciate the mindset with which the Nagar Nigam is handling the issue. No doubt, on account of religious beliefs, few people avail the services of electric crematoriums, but we feel that if proper facilities are provided at the electric crematoriums and people are educated and made aware of the advantages and disadvantages of use of electric crematoriums, more and more people will be attracted to avail the facilities. It is high time when the Nagar Nigam, Prayagraj should give up its old mindset and take immediate steps for improving the infrastructure of the two electric crematoriums and launch campaign for spreading awareness amongst general public in respect of the advantages in availing the services of electric crematoriums.” In this backdrop, the court in its order dated November 12 directed the additional chief secretary, Nagar Vikas, UP to examine the matter and place before this court its plan in respect of improvement of the infrastructure of the two electric crematoriums and the time frame within which it will be implemented. On the question of ban on use of plastic the commissioner, Prayagraj division has filed his affidavit annexing therewith order dated November 8, 2021, whereby a committee comprising ADM city, Prayagraj, additional municipal commissioner, Nagar Nigam, Prayagraj and superintendent of police (City), Prayagraj has been formed to oversee the implementation of the ban on plastic carry bags in pursuance of government order (GO) dated July 15, 2018. BOX The Allahabad High Court has issued notices to Sri Kashi Vishwanath Special Area Development Authority and has asked the Authority to file its affidavit through its chief executive officer (CEO) giving details of the schemes and all constructions which are proposed or are underway in and around the river Gange in Varanasi district. The court passed this order after the vice-chairman, Varanasi Development Authority (VDA), filed an affidavit stating that the regulation of construction in or along the bed of the river Ganga in Varanasi district is now being regulated in accordance with the provisions of Sri Kashi Vishwanath Special Area Development Board Varanasi Act, 2018 and is outside the purview of the regulated area falling under the Urban Planning and Development Act, 1973.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/ganga-pollution-lack-of-coordination-between-govt-depts-causing-confusion-before-court-hc/articleshow/87766603.cms||---

There is a stampede-like situation in the Mulayam Singh Yadav’s family, while the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati is still in isolation,” she said, claiming that the time of SP, BSP and the Congress has already ended. “Chunav ke samay mai active ho jane se kuch nahin hota, aur apko panch-saat saal tap karna parta hai janata ke beech mai jakar (It doesn’t help when you get active during polls... you have to work hard five to seven years for the masses,” said Bharti, adding, “You have to work really hard to get your work noticed.” She said, “No party would be able to stand before the BJP in the forthcoming assembly polls. The opposition parties would not even touch double digit seat figure as the people of the state have already made up their mind to support the BJP, which would register an impressive triumph in the assembly polls.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/yogiji-is-my-refined-better-version-says-uma-bharti/articleshow/87766600.cms||Kapil Dixit
---||Mumbai||Wakf land compensation case: Official questioned in Mumbai||Mumbai: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) recorded the statement of a deputy collector of land acquisition, Pune, on Wednesday, in a money laundering case related to fraudulent claim of land compensation from the state government in the name of a trust registered with the Waqf Board. The deputy collector claimed that there was no money laundering since the money claimed fraudulently was returned to the trust’s account and frozen by the police. It is alleged that the deputy collector, Ajay Pawar, had conducted a meeting to examine the documents before clearing the compensation in the lieu of the trust land that the government had acquired for Rajiv Gandhi IT Park. The government had announced a Rs 8.76 crore compensation to the land owner, Tabut Inam Endowment Trust. There was a dispute after four persons claimed to be trustees and office-bearers of the trust. The accused even produced allegedly forged NOC of the Waqf Board stating that it had no objection on releasing the fund after which the amount was released. A case was registered at Bundgarden police station in Pune in this connection. –VijayV Singh||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/wakf-land-compensation-case-official-questioned-in-mumbai/articleshow/87768560.cms||---

The ruling that would speed up the process of obtaining divorce and getting it endorsed in a public record through a court was issued by a division bench of Justice A Muhamed Mustaque and Justice Kauser Edappagath. A petition filed by Asbi KN through advocate C Dilip was considered by the court. While a Muslim man divorcing his wife through out-of-court process is called a ‘talaq’, a Muslim woman doing so is called a ‘khula’. If divorce is through mutual consent, it is called ‘mubaarat’. It is a common practice to seek the court’s endorsement, under Section 7(d) of the Family Courts Act, 1984 so as to have a public record of the divorce. In the judgment, authored by Justice Kauser, the high court said, “The endorsement of extrajudicial divorce and consequential declaration of the status of the parties by the Family Court invoking S.7(d) of the Act is contemplated only to have a public record of the extrajudicial divorce. Hence, a detailed enquiry is neither essential nor desirable in a proceeding initiated by either of the parties to endorse an extrajudicial divorce and to declare the marital status. The Family Court has to simply ascertain whether a valid pronouncement/declaration of talaq or khula was made and it was preceded by effective attempt of conciliation.” No further enquiry as in the case of an adversarial litigation like chief examination and cross examination of the parties are not at all contemplated while endorsing extrajudicial divorce under Muslim personal law, the court said, adding that that the family court should endorse the plea if it is prima facie satisfied that a valid pronouncement of ‘talaq’, ‘khula’, or ‘mubaarat’ was made. The court also issued a seven-point guideline for family courts to deal with such cases. The judgment was delivered on October 12 but a copy became available only on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-only-short-hearing-needed-for-courts-nod/articleshow/87767460.cms||---

Sadly, only three were approved. According to education department officials, pandemic-induced crisis has forced parents to get their wards enrolled in village schools as they can no longer afford the hefty fee charged by private schools. Notably, this year witnessed an unprecedented rise in the number of admissions in these schools. Last year, there were 1,84,000 students in the district, which is now 2,09,000. On the rise in enrollment, district coordinator, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, Saleem Beg, said, "We had demanded 178 new classrooms but funds have been sanctioned for only three classrooms. Besides, there are 29 dilapidated buildings in the district. A proposal to renovate these was sent to authorities but the latter allocated budget for only five buildings. The number of students making a switch to government schools has been quite high,’gone up jumped up drastically.” Speaking to TOI, district president, parents’ association, Nrapendra Deshwal, said, "The facilities in primary and higher primary government schools are not as good as the private ones. But the fact remains that the number of students taking admission to government schools has gone up due to the profound impact of the pandemic.” Though private schools remained closed, parents were forced to deposit fee, the reason why parents opted for government schools. “Parents feel their wards are safe in schools that are nearby as private schools are far-off. But the problem is that the classrooms do not match the proportion of children in village schools,” added Deshwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/student-strength-up-in-govt-schools-edu-dept-seeks-178-new-classrooms-gets-nod-for-only-three/articleshow/87766612.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Navi-mumbai||Maharashtra: Give Covid-19 vaccine shot to high-risk parents’ wards after comorbid kids, says Experts||Children of comorbid parents should also be prioritised for Covid vaccination besides kids having comorbidities to prevent transmission of infection from children to their high-risk parents and grandparents at home, experts underlined. “It is true that when we vaccinate children of high-risk parents, it will prevent the transmission of infection from children to their high-risk parents/grandparents. Therefore, after vaccination of high-risk children, the next priority should be the immunisation of children of high-risk parents. The sdemand for the same is growing,” said senior paediatrician Pramod Jog, a member of the state’s paediatric Covid task force. The state’s paediatric task force last week submitted its recommendations to the state government to preferentially vaccinate children having underlying medical conditions like obesity, malnutrition, juvenile diabetes and nine others. The demand to vaccinate children of high-risk parents started after it. “After vaccination of children with high-risk conditions, next in priority should be adolescent children of high-risk parents,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India (HBI), Pune chapter. The two Covid vaccines — ZyCoV-D and Covaxin — meant for immunisation of children in the 2-18 years age bracket are likely to be introduced together under the country’s Covid immunisation programme by December-end. Covid immunisation of 472 million children under 18 years across the country involves logistic issues like the supply of vaccines. Prioritising the vaccination process holds the key. Current evidence suggests that children with medical complexity, with genetic, neurologic can be at an increased risk for severe illness from Covid-19. Like adults, children with obesity, diabetes, asthma or chronic lung disease can also be at an increased risk for severe illness from Covid-19. The Covid-19 vaccines would not be available to healthy children initially. About seven-eight months may be required for immunisation of all children. Hence, schooling should not be withheld for such a long period, experts stressed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-give-covid-shot-to-high-risk-parents-wards-after-comorbid-kids-says-experts/articleshow/87777745.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Even as this has remained only a proposal so far, Rajasthan government has reached out to industrialists here wooing them to set up units along the refinery coming up at Barmer in that state. A refinery, with an investment of Rs48,000 crore, is being built at Barmer. It is expected to be ready by 2023. The state is looking for industries that may work as ancillaries to the facility, or even use the upstream and downstream products as raw materials. The Rajasthan government is hoping to get investment to the tune of another Rs48,000 crore from the industries coming from different states near the refinery. A team of officials from Rajasthan Industrial and Investment Corporation (RIICO) was camping in Nagpur for the last three days. A meeting was held with officials of Laghu Udyog Bharti (LUB) on Wednesday. LUB is the industrial association affiliated to Sangh Parivar. As it is headquartered in Nagpur, the purpose was to get access to all the 28,000-odd members across the country, said officials. RIICO officials said the state government has come up with a concept of non-resident Rajasthani. This means they are targeting businessmen hailing from Rajasthan and now running successful business in other states. “Their forefathers may have needed to migrate years ago due to hardships those days. However, we are now trying to woo them back, saying the situation has changed, and attractive schemes are on the offer,” said Virender Surana, a senior DGM from RIICO. Among the big companies, Confidence Petroleum from Nagpur has shown interest in investing in Rajasthan. The company has plans to set up filling stations and a bottling plant for compressed natural gas (CNG). Nitin Khara, chairman of Confidence Petroleum, also confirmed the development. The company already has bottling plants at Udaipur, Jaipur and Pali in Rajasthan. There are plans to set up another, apart from having filling outlets in the sites offered by RIICO, he said. The Barmer refinery is a joint venture of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited and Rajasthan government. This was initiated after petroleum reserves were found in the area, though imported crude and transported through Kandla port in Gujarat will also be refined here, said the officials. The benefits include investment subsidy, employment generation subsidy and exemption from electricity duty. In A Nutshell Rajasthan government is offering subsidies on investment, employment generation and power duty exemption Targeting businessmen whose forefathers had migrated from Rajasthan Barmer refinery is expected to be ready by 2023||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/raj-govt-woos-businesses-over-refinery-project/articleshow/87767462.cms||Shishir Arya

Khurshid has been in the eye of a storm over parallels drawn between “Hindutva” and Islamic terrorist outfits in his recent book 'Sunrise Over Ayodhya: Nationhood in Our Time'. “The bullets were found embedded in the ceiling and walls. The forensic team has seized all the recovered material for further investigation,” DIG (Kumaon) Nilesh Anand Bharne told TOI. Bharne said prima facie "it appears that someone in the mob had opened fire". He added that a team headed by circle officer (CO) Bhowali is investigating the incident. Khurshid’s house, located in Satkhol area in Ramgarh block of Nainital district, was vandalised on Monday afternoon. No one was hurt in the house that is looked after by caretakers, one of whom had later said someone in the mob had pointed a gun at his family. Soon after the incident, in a Facebook post the former minister of external affairs, sharing pictures and videos of charred doors and other parts of his house, had written, “I hoped to open these doors to my friends who have left this calling card. Am I still wrong to say this cannot be Hinduism? ...So such is debate now. Shame is too ineffective a word. Besides, I still hope that we can reason together one day and agree to disagree if not more.” Police have booked 21 people in connection with the incident. “One accused, Rakesh Kapil, has been identified and is absconding, while 20 others are yet to be identified," the DIG said. The FIR has been lodged under sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 456 (trespass or house-breaking), 552 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint) and 504 (insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/live-cartridge-7-empty-shells-found-at-kurshids-vandalised-house/articleshow/87765773.cms||Gaurav Talwar

The immediate response to people’s problem in the remotest locations during the campaign has been appreciated by those who had been longing for a respite. The sanctioning of 160 land leases on a single day was one of the biggest achievements of the PGKS campaign in the district. According to BDO Praveen Kumar Gupta, despite scattered population, 160 land leases were handed over to people of Karakala village in Jhallara. People had been living in this village for more than 50 years but had never heard of a patta (land lease). “During the campaign, we provided land lease to 90 per cent of the village population,” said Gupta. During the camp, 20 birth certificates, 10 death certificates and 11 families under NREGA scheme were provided new job cards. Pension payment order letters were also distributed to 13 persons. The PGKS campaign was a pleasing experience for people in other villages too. For Ram Singh of Sakariakhedi village in Mavli, getting the land deed was not less than a miracle. Development officer Jitendra Singh Chundawat said Singh’s house was situated in the “abadi” land of gram panchayat but due to lack of lease, he was not getting bank loan and other benefits. When Singh brought his problem in the camp, the officer in-charge and the development officer got the lease issued on the spot. Singh also got the benefit of Swachh Bharat Mission wherein Rs 12,000 were transferred directly into his bank account. His family was felicitated with “Garvilo Pariwaar” title for use of toilet in Swachh Bharat Mission. Samri Devi, a state widow pension beneficiary of Balewadi village, was provided the much-needed relief as her monthly pension was increased to Rs 1,000 from Rs 500 after necessary corrections in the age certificate. For Ganga of Pipli Phala village, the PGKS camps were a boon when she benefited under the Palanhara scheme. Ganga's two daughters were not getting the benefit of foster care. In this camp, all the documents of Palanhar scheme were prepared and application was prepared on the spot with the help of Sarpanch and Village Development Office. Approval was issued on the spot after verifying the form online by e-mitra and the process of adoption was approved in just one day. In Gogunda’s Obra Kala Gram panchayat, land lease was distributed to 128 beneficiaries. This camp proved to be a windfall for Bhanwari Bai, who was deprived of food security benefits at the ration shop because of the finger print issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/prashashan-camps-boon-for-villagers-in-udaipur-district/articleshow/87768153.cms||---

---||India||GST intel busts laundering racket involving UP firm||NEW DELHI: In one of the biggest cases of money laundering unearthed in recent times, the Meerut zonal unit of the Directorate of GST Intelligence (DGGI) has initiated action in the alleged sale of Rs 5,000 crore worth of packaging materials by a little known Noida-based company, Montage Enterprises, to 228 companies, all of which have been found to exist only on paper. Five people have been arrested so far in the case, including two directors of Montage Enterprises who were remanded to 14 days of judicial custody on Tuesday by a chief judicial magistrate court in Meerut. According to DGGI, searches on transporters and certain pan masala/tobacco companies revealed the modus operandi where the Noida-based firm was found engaged in clandestine diversion of packaging materials against cash payments to some pan masala manufacturers. The probe has led to a few of the pan masala companies to acknowledge cash transactions worth Rs 1,100 crore. The firms have since deposited Rs 50 crore against duty evasion. The total cash generated in this racket is several times of Rs 5,000 crore of the packaging materials allegedly supplied, said a source. The seizure of unaccounted raw materials (bought in cash) and finished goods from one of the gutka manufacturers, which has two Bollywood superstars as its brand managers, has been estimated to be worth over Rs 800 crore. The firm, after arrest of a senior executive, has deposited Rs 20 crore against duty evasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gst-intel-busts-laundering-racket-involving-up-firm/articleshow/87768972.cms||Pradeep Thakur

However, University authorities said this particular rice variety, KAU Manu Varna, is recommended for the plains and not for hill ranges like Wayanad. “This was released for low lands of Kerala, especially for the Kole lands during Virippu and Mundakan seasons,” said Prof K Ajith Kumar, associate director of KAU’s regional agricultural research station at Ambalavayal in Wayanad. KAU Manu Varna is a rice variety released in December 2019 from KAU’s agricultural research station (ARS), Mannuthy, having 128-138 days duration, non-lodging and non-shattering and high tolerance to salinity. The variety also has other positive attributes like a higher number of productive tillers/plants, good milling and cooking qualities, tolerance to stem borer, leaf folder, gall midge, high amylose content, and is brown rice. However, its tolerance to blast disease is less compared to other similar varieties like KAU Manu Ratna. “The pathogen-climate-host interactions play a major role in the expression of pathogenicity of the causal organism. When a less tolerant variety developed for a different agro-climatic condition is introduced into an entirely different agro-climatic situation with inherent predisposing climatic factors favouring the disease, there is a high probability of severe disease incidence,” said Prof Kumar. However, farmers have alleged that University authorities have not told them in advance about the unsuitability of this variety for highlands like Wayanad. “We have purchased about 4,600kg of paddy seed from the ARS and cultivated it in about 250 acres of paddy field. We had told University authorities that we are from Wayanad. If they had shared even a hint of the unsuitability of this variety in highlands, we wouldn’t have purchased such a large quantity of seed,” P Rajeev Marar of Kaniyambetta, Wayanad, told TOI. Farmers are demanding that the government should compensate them for the crop loss.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/crop-damage-in-wayanad-not-due-to-seed-defects-claims-kau/articleshow/87767477.cms||T Ramavarman

The range offers sightings of elephants mostly but the track that takes them to such alluring sightings is in need of repairs. Incessant rainfall and then sudden October rain have left the track damaged. About 20km of the 36km track of Chilla range is broken, causing inconvenience to tourists having already paid for the trip. “It was a bad experience. They shouldn’t have given permission for the safari when they were not even ready with the tracks,” said one of the visitors of Chilla, who had to return midway on Tuesday. As per authorities, they had reconstructed a part of the road after the rains. But it got washed away due to unexpected October rains, pounding the entire state and leaving almost 70 people dead at various areas. “We had already opened the track for tourists in October after repairing it but incessant rainfall damaged it, making tourists suffer. Now again, we have tried to repair one of its patch so that tourists can move ahead and spot elephants and tigers,” said Anil Penuili, Ranger Officer, Chilla range, Rajaji Tiger Reserve. Citing fund crunch, forest officials claimed that the track was in such a state for lack of budget allocation. “With limited resources and funds, we try to do whatever we can do in our power to build the tracks. Once the budget is allocated, the track can be rebuilt,” added Penuili. The RTR has been visited by at least 100 tourists in the past three days, as per the officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/track-broken-wildlife-enthusiasts-turned-away-from-chilla-range-of-rajaji-tiger-reserve/articleshow/87765776.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Kolkata||After Covid hiatus, Kolkata-Singapore flights to take off again in November-end||KOLKATA: Singapore Airlines is all set to resume flights to Kolkata by the end of the month following the Singapore government decision to extend its vaccinated travel lane programme (VTL) to India. VTL allows quarantine-free travel for fully vaccinated individuals. Sources in the travel trade industry said the airline officials had indicated a November 29 date for the first flight between Singapore and Kolkata post Covid. Though there are flights between Singapore and India under the Vande Bharat programme, no flight to and from Kolkata has been operating. “Singapore Airlines will start flights from November 29, subject to the signing of bilateral agreement on bubble flights between the two countries,” said Travel Agents Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi. If the fight does go through, it will be the first direct link between Kolkata and Southeast Asia post pandemic. While the airline has not indicated the frequency, Travel Agents Association of India chairman (east) Manav Soni said he hoped there would be an Singapore Airlines flight on alternate days with Indian carriers — IndiGo or Vistara — operating on the other days to ensure a daily connection. “There is sizeable visiting friends and relatives traffic, besides that of students and tourists. There would be no problem in operating a daily flight with full load,” said Soni. The travel agent associations have also requested Indian carriers to start flights to Thailand, following Thai Airways’s decision to withdraw its six decade-old service from Kolkata. Thai Smile has hinted at operating flights from Kolkata in January with the Bird Group as its GSA. Sources in the travel trade industry said Air India had indicated its willingness to connect Kolkata with Bangkok and that SpiceJet was keen on a flight to Phuket. Prior to the pandemic, Thai Airways operated a daily flight to Kolkata. IndiGo flew twice daily to Bangkok, while SpiceJet and Air India also had connections. A couple of travel agents, including Gainwell Travel, have also announced chartered flights to Phuket on December 18, 22, 26 and 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-covid-hiatus-kol-singapore-flights-to-take-off-again-in-nov-end/articleshow/87767490.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The order also stipulated that cops must remove the “police logo,” from their private vehicles with immediate effect. The police also said that action will be taken against those who don’t follow the orders. Talking to TOI, a senior police official said that the police headquarters (PHQ) had recently made it very clear that rampant misuse of the police logos on private vehicles is a growing vehicle that warrants immediate action. “There is a risk of someone using police logo for illegal activities. Also, cops posted at a checkpoint are likely to shy away from stopping the vehicle, regardless of who is inside the vehicle,” the official claimed. The official said that besides the staff, CLG and police Mitra members will also be asked to remove police colours from their vehicles. “Only police vehicles authorised by the department are allowed to put the logo, the red and blue colours are meant to be used only after prior authorization,” the official said, adding that action will be taken against those who flouted the norms very soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cops-told-not-to-use-police-colours-on-pvt-vehicles/articleshow/87768158.cms||---

The doctor filed a police complaint against the patient’s kin at the Mangaluru East police station on Tuesday. Dr Mohammed Imdad, who had been working in the hospital since September 2019, said he was on night shift on Monday when he was attacked.

---||Dehradun||Police must show sensitivity in matters that could take communal turn: Uttarakhand HC||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC), in a matter that turned communal when police filed an FIR on the complaint of one community and ignored the other, said on Wednesday that there is a need for the police to show sensitivity in such issues. The court stressed on the importance of hearing both sides before lodging an FIR. The bench of Chief Justice R S Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma was on Wednesday hearing a petition filed by advocate Sana Hussain, who appeared on behalf of her family in a property dispute case in the Handi Bandi area of Mallital. She alleged that the police were pressurised by certain right-wing groups to arrest her brother, Saud Hussain, based on an FIR lodged by a man named Kuldeep Kumar. Alleging partisan behavior on the part of the police, Hussain alleged that when her family went to the police station to file a complaint based on which an FIR could be lodged, the police refused to take action. However, when Kuldeep Kumar went to the station along with members of some right-wing groups to register a complaint against her brother and some other family members the very next day, the police lodged an FIR. A case was registered against Saud Hussain under sections 354, 504, and 323 of the Indian Penal Code. Hussain alleged that members of the right-wing group, some of whom she says were BJP workers, started raising slogans demanding her brother's arrest while having a sit-in protest in the middle of the road in front of the police station. It was then, she says, that the police gave in and arrested her brother. The court asked the senior superintendent of police (SSP) Nainital to appear in court via teleconferencing. However, the bench was told that she was on leave. The court then asked the director general of police (DGP), Ashok Kumar, to appear in the matter. The DGP said that he has suspended the kotwal of Nainital, Pritam Singh, for taking action against only one party and not heeding the other in the case. He also said that disciplinary action has been taken against him. He added that security will be provided to the family of the advocate. The court thereafter disposed of the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/police-must-show-sensitivity-in-matters-that-could-take-communal-turn-ukhand-hc/articleshow/87765783.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Police yet to find evidence of firing at BJP MP’s house||Jaipur: Over a week after Bharatpur MP Ranjeeta Koli was allegedly attacked in Bayana town, police are yet to find any evidence of miscreants firing shots outside her house. A senior official told TOI that no shells were found after the incident, nor have any bullet marks been found on Koli’s house. “There are always some tell-tale signs of firing, but we have not stumbled upon anything which could confirm the allegations of firings yet,” said an official, adding that the inquiry is still underway. The alleged attack on Koli took place on November 10 when unidentified miscreants had put up a threatening poster with her photo crossed by a blue marker and two bullets on either side. The incidents led to a huge uproar and Rajasthan police constituted a special investigation team (SIT) to look into the case. So far, the investigation agencies have not been able to corroborate how many shots were fired, nor have they received any evidence which could point to the firing incident. A senior official claimed that locals in the area did not hear any gunshots. “We have not yet ruled out the firing yet, it is just that the incident has not yet been confirmed, neither in the preliminary probe nor by the locals,” the official said. The Rajasthan police said the SIT was also probing to see who went to Koli’s house in the middle of the night to put threatening posters and a letter. “We have been examining technical inputs to ascertain the movement of suspects around the MP’s house that night,” the official said, adding that the hunt for suspects continues but nothing substantial has come to their notice so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/police-yet-to-find-evidence-of-firing-at-bjp-mps-house/articleshow/87768176.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Dum Dum airport's domestic terminal to get liquor off-shop||KOLKATA: The Dum Dum airport, one of the oldest in Asia, will soon have its first liquor off-shop in the domestic terminal, like its counterpart in Delhi has for the past few years.  A source said talks were on with the Airports Authority of India and state excise department for an off-shop in the domestic terminal. “The off-shop will be managed by the state beverage corporation, Bevco. It (Bevco) has permission for retail trade as well but since its inception, the corporation has never tried its hand in retail. This will be the first retail venture for Bevco,” said the source. According to the official, one of the reasons behind setting up the off-shop could be that the prices of most bottled in origin (BIO) single malt, blended Scotch, vodka and gin and overseas spirits bottled in India (OSBI) in Bengal have become very competitive. “Prices of some single malt and blended Scotch whisky in the domestic terminal shop—same as that in Bengal—would be even cheaper than those available at the Delhi duty free shop in the international terminal. Lots of people used to buy expensive liquors (BIO) from outside as five litres per person is allowed in airlines but now, that will stop,” added sources. The excise department did not comment but later, excise commissioner Umasankar S said the recent slash in prices would help check smuggling and would not affect the revenue of the government. According to him, the excise department seized 1.6 lakh litres of non-duty paid IMFL in the fiscal from April to October 31 in Bengal. “The price slash would help restrict the entry of spurious and duplicate liquor from neighboring states and check smuggling of non-duty paid IMFL. The rationalization of the duty structure here would also help avoid public health hazards,” he added. According to Umasankar S, the new prices were lower than that in Jharkhand and Odisha. The excise commissioner also admitted there has been a fall in consumption in the last one year. There has been a hike in duty on IMFL twice in 2020. The revenue from excise in the first half of this fiscal (2021-22) was Rs 5,471 crore while it was Rs 4,328 crore in the same period last fiscal (2020-21). The total revenue from excise for the state was Rs 12,300 crore in 2020-21. Prices of IMFL, beer, bottled in origin liquor (BIO), overseas spirits bottled in India (OSBI) and wine has come came down by 20%-30%. For beer, the fall is marginal (5%-6%) but for some IMFL registered with excise, the price slash is by even 30%. According to the prices registered with excise so far, rates of some leading premium and semi-premium whisky brands have been slashed by 30% from Rs 1,350 for a 750ml-bottle to Rs 920. For deluxe whisky brands, the fall is 25%-26% from Rs 980 to Rs 710. For popular rum brands, the fall is 15%-18% from Rs 640-650 to Rs 540. Prices of some overseas spirits bottled in India has come down by over 30% from Rs 2,290 a bottle to Rs 1,640, while for some BIOs, the drop is by 35%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/domestic-terminal-to-get-liquor-off-shop/articleshow/87767530.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Former Olympian race walker and coach says Uttarakhand govt gave him half of promised prize money||DEHRADUN: Race walker Gurmeet Singh, who has participated in the 2012 and 2016 Olympics and was part of the recent Tokyo Olympics as a coach, has alleged that the Uttarakhand government has only given him half of the promised prize money for his achievements. Having coached race walking stars -- Priyanka Goswami and Sandeep Kumar -- and eventually booking their place in the Tokyo Olympics, the former Olympian said, “I should have got Rs 11 lakh by 2016-17 but the government hasn't given me the entire amount to date. I have only got half the amount.” The Bajpur resident claimed that according to the state’s sports policy framed in 2014, he should have got Rs 10 lakh for winning a gold medal in the 20km race walk event at the Asian Race Walking Championship held in March 2016 in Japan and another Rs 1 lakh for participating in the World Championship in May 2016 in Italy. “Government paid me as per the 2016 prize money policy, whereas I should have got the promised cash prize as per the 2014 policy,” Singh said, contending that since the new policy came into effect in December 2016, a few months after his wins, he should be given prize money as per the old policy. The new policy halved the entitlement of prize money laid down in the 2014 policy. Refuting the former Olympian’s accusations, a state government official cited a government order issued in December 2016 which said that ”all previous orders regarding the prize money amount are cancelled and the athletes who are yet to get any prize money, even for the events that took place before December 2016, will be paid as per the amount mentioned in the order issued in December 2016 for the implementation of the amended sports policy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/former-olympian-race-walker-and-coach-says-ukhand-govt-gave-him-half-of-promised-prize-money/articleshow/87765803.cms||Mohammad Anab

The dairy has a daily collection of 15.5 lakh litre of milk and supplies it to Mumbai and Pune. The dairy used to get complaints of milk adulteration. According to authorities, the common mode of adulteration was piercing the pouch and drawing the milk out using a syringe. The pouch is then filled up with water. Vishwas Patil, chairman of the dairy said, “With the new packaging, if the pouch is pierced a blue colour applied to one of the layers will spread automatically. It will impart a dark colour on the pouch which will be a sign for customers to understand that the milk is adulterated. Right now the packaging will be used for the milk sold in Mumbai and slowly it will be used for other places as well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-gokul-launches-5-layer-polyfilm-milk-packaging/articleshow/87767541.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Construction halted, but dust flies in face of ban||NEW DELHI: With the worsening air quality, the authorities have put a ban on construction activities and directed agencies to take adequate measures to prevent dust pollution. However, on-ground efforts seem to be inadequate. Though the municipal corporations and government agencies claim to have stepped up efforts and issued challans for not following the norms to control dust, TOI saw construction material and dug up soil lying in the open and dust flying when it visited a few sites. At the Pragati Maidan site near Bhairon Marg-Ring Road intersection, the Public Works Department (PWD) had covered the construction area at some points with green drapes, but most areas remained exposed. Dust was seen rising as no water was being sprinkled. Though PWD had installed an anti-smog gun, it was not functioning on Wednesday afternoon. A similar scene prevailed at the Barapullah Phase-III construction site on the Yamuna floodplain near Mayur Vihar-I. Dug-up soil was lying uncovered along with construction material and machinery. No green drapes were visible there. At a distance, smoke was seen billowing out, giving rise to speculation of garbage being burnt there. According to National Green Tribunal (NGT) guidelines, biomass burning is strictly prohibited. Since the Barapullah construction site is surrounded by crop fields, dust could be seen flying there. There were no preventive measures being taken, no anti-smog gun was there and the area was not covered. Commuters complained about dust pollution saying the ongoing construction was responsible for it. However, the situation was slightly better at Ring Road near Indraprastha Metro Station next to the headquarters of World Health Organisation. The construction agency had covered the area with blue plastic sheets and an anti-smog gun was deployed at the site. Construction material was also covered there. Iqbal Singh, a senior PWD official, said adequate precautions were being taken to tackle pollution at the construction sites. “There is a smog gun installed at Bhairon Marg-Ring Road junction. There are four more smog guns in different sectors, including Mathura Road. They are operated at an interval of a few hours. We are also taking additional pollution-control measures, like covering sites to ensure that dust doesn’t spread,” he added. Experts said dust pollution from C&D waste was one of the major contributing factors in the overall pollution levels of the city. “Solutions like anti-smog guns are limited to small areas as most of the big infrastructure is linear. There is a requirement of mobile sprinklers or smog guns instead of the fixed ones that are being used currently,” said Rajneesh Sareen from CSE. “Dust contributes to about 18% of total PM2.5 share of Delhi’s air. These fine particles go deep into the lungs and even the bloodstream and cause health problems,” said Shambhavi Shukla, assistant programme manager, air pollution, CSE.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/construction-halted-but-dust-flies-in-face-of-ban/articleshow/87767535.cms||Kushagra Dixit
---||Jaipur||Schools reopen with 100% capacity but Covid cases rising||Jaipur: The gradual rise in Covid cases at a time when the state has allowed schools to run with 100% capacity has left parents and the institutes in a fix. Rajasthan is among a few states that have reopened schools with 100% capacity. Maharashtra, Gujarat and Odisha have allowed just the senior classes to function. Officials said they were monitoring the Covid situation daily and if needed they would reconsider the decision or revert to 50% attendance. Reopening of schools from November 15 has divided the parents and schools over the safety and security of children. While officials said the decision was fully backed by a panel of experts, parents questioned who would monitor schools if they were following all protocols. “In the first three days, 33 out of 40 attended classes in my son’s class. I think the government should not have opened the classes for the remaining session,” said Nitesh Sharma, whose son studies in class VI. Jameel Khan, director of a group of schools, said they had been getting calls from parents demanding complete assurance. “In our schools, we have been taking utmost care by allowing only those staff who are fully vaccinated, but what if any child is infected from outside. It is a collective responsibility of schools, parents and the government to create a sustainable environment for offline classes,” said Khan. Defending the government’s move, RK Gupta, senior professor of paediatrics, Sawai Man Singh Medical College, said reopening of schools was in line with the global call by WHO and UNICEF to take necessary steps for starting offline classes. “The well-defined protocols have been in place of following social distancing, handwashing, no overcrowding, proper sanitation, compulsory face masks and no overcrowding with strict monitoring by sample test. The defined method is universally being followed to contain the spread,” said Gupta.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Alipore court holds actor Nusrat Jahan’s marriage with businessman Nikhil Jain ‘legally invalid’||KOLKATA: An Alipore civil court on Wednesday ruled actor-MP Nusrat Jahan’s wedding with businessman Nikhil Jain two years ago “legally not valid”. “It is declared that the alleged marriage held on 19/06/2019 at Bodrum, Turkey in between the plaintiff and the defendant is not legally valid,” read the order by the civil judge (senior division), second court in Alipore. “That marriage in question was never registered in Turkey…. That their alleged marriage did not take place following any religious practice and that inter-faith marriage between a Hindu and a Muslim has no legal sanctity under any personal law prevailed in India. That the parties to the suit never got married under the Special Marriage Act and so, their consensual union cannot be treated as a marriage,” the order read. TOI called and sent messages to Nusrat Jahan multiple times but there was no response from her.  Jain told TOI he was feeling relieved after the order and considered it the best gift on his birthday. “I had appealed for an annulment of marriage before the court in March this year after Nusrat walked out of the marriage and declared it didn’t mean anything to her. I am happy the court has ruled in my favour and has set both of us free from the complex relationship we were in,” said Jain. After winning the Lok Sabha elections in 2019 on a Trinamool ticket, Jahan hosted a wedding reception at a five-star hotel in Kolkata, which was attended by dignitaries. After that, Jain said, they lived together as husband and wife and introduced themselves as a married couple. But in the latter half of 2020, their relationship allegedly turned sour and Jahan left Jain’s flat in November. By June 2021, Jahan had started talking about her marriage having no legal sanctity. Since the birth of her son in August, she has been living with actor Yash Dasgupta, who is stated as the boy’s father in birth certificate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nusrat-marriage-legally-not-valid/articleshow/87767555.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Mumbai||Crime branch gets nod to declare ex-Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh absconder||MUMBAI: A magistrate’s court on Wednesday allowed a plea by crime branch to declare former city police chief Param Bir Singh and two others as absconding accused and issue a proclamation against them in an alleged extortion case where they threatened a businessman and hotelier and extorted money. Crime branch on Monday moved the plea against Param, Vinay Singh and Chhota Shakeel aide Riyaz Bhatti. A proclamation will now be issued in newspapers asking the accused to present themselves before the authorities within 30 days. It will also be pasted at their addresses. “If the accused fail to appear within this time, proceedings can commence for attachment of their properties,” special public prosecutor Shekhar Jagtap said. The plea said a non-bailable warrant was issued by court on October 30, but the trio was not available at their addresses. It alleged that they had gone into hiding after the case was registered. Under section 82 of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), which deals with “proclamation for person absconding”, if any court has reason to believe that a person against whom a warrant has been issued has absconded or is concealing himself so that the warrant cannot be executed, then it may publish a written proclamation requiring him to appear at a specified place. The plea invoked Section 83 of CrPC, through which an absconding accused’s properties can be attached. Last week, the magistrate court issued a non-bailable warrant against Param. This was the third such non-bailable warrant issued against him. Earlier, a Thane court and the 37th metropolitan court issued non-bailable warrants against Param in connection with two extortion cases registered against him and others. Crime branch said cops had gone to Param’s Malabar Hill home on November 10 but due to his absence, the warrant could not be served. The statements of a police guard stationed at the building and the cook were recorded. The guard told them that for three months, Param had not come to the building. He said Param’s family also did not live there, and he did not know their whereabouts. The cook said he had been living and working in the building for over a year. He too said that neither Param nor his family had been to the premises in three months. Vinay Singh’s wife told cops he had not been to their Kandivli apartment since the FIR was registered. She claimed that he had not been in touch with her. The woman said she was unaware about his current location. At Bhatti’s Versova home, his wife too gave a similar statement. Mumbai Police had formed a special investigation team to probe the extortion case against Param and a separate case of similar nature (not related to him), which was being handled by Unit IX of crime branch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-crime-branch-gets-nod-to-declare-param-absconder/articleshow/87767561.cms||Rebecca Samervel

According to a message circulated to parents by Jayshree Periwal International School authorities, a primary class student has been found infected with the virus. The message reads: “A child from grade ..., has tested COVID positive. The child was using personal transport and is a day scholar. We recommend that if your child shows any symptoms, they should be tested. In view of this, Grade ... will remain closed tomorrow (November 18) as we prepare for online classes. (sic).” TOI has withheld the grade of the student. As per the message, offline classes from pre-primary and primary will remain closed on Thursday. TOI repeatedly made phone calls and even sent text messages to the school principal for a statement, but there was no response. Sunil Yadav, president of All Rajasthan Parents Forum, said this is the second school where a child was found to be Covid positive. A day earlier, the SMS School confirmed that two of its students tested positive. “The government’s decision of reopening school with 100% capacity without giving an option of online classes is showing its impact now. Students are getting infected with Covid, risking the lives. Government should make schools provide options for online and offline classes to students. Or else schools will put our children in danger,” said Yadav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/another-student-of-a-pvt-school-tests-ve/articleshow/87768195.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Fadnavis became restless after losing power: Sharad Pawar||Nagpur: A day after opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis slammed Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) terming it as “most corrupt” in Maharashtra’s history, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar launched a counter attack against him at his home turf stating that he had become restless after losing power. In Nagpur for his three-day tour of Vidarbha, the MVA’s chief architect on Wednesday called on the former chief minister to accept the reality. “I can understand that BJP state president Chandrakant Patil is making such (inflammatory) statements (on Amravati riots), but I am surprised over Fadnavis making them. He shouldn’t stoop to this level.” The octogenarian, however, lauded Union minister Nitin Gadkari stating that he helped everyone irrespective of background or party. Refusing to comment on the riots and Shiv Sena’s demand to ban an organisation allegedly involved in fomenting the trouble, the NCP chief said whatever happened in Tripura, its repercussions should not have taken place in Maharashtra. “It’s a very sensitive issue where some people are trying to give it a communal colour for their obvious political benefits. Whosoever responsible for the riots must be brought to the books. I had asked home minister Dilip Walse Patil to visit Amravati to take stock of the situation,” he said. Defending his close aide and former home minister Anil Deshmukh, Pawar said injustice was meted out to him as the complainant (former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh) went missing and he himself had stated that he had no proof. “It started after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray received a complaint from Singh about instructions to police recover “hafta”. I also received the same complaint, but when I inquired, nothing was found out. Now, Singh may be declared absconder as he is not responding to the cops, but Deshmukh is in jail.” Speaking on MPCC president Nana Patole’s repeated jibes against NCP, the Maratha strongman said his party still followed Mahatma Gandhi and former prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s ideologies, even though they were not the part of Congress. “We are working together in the MVA government and we are more or less similar to Congress. A person, who won Lok Sabha and assembly polls on the BJP ticket, would have the same mentality.” Emphasizing on having a third front at the national level to fight the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led BJP in 2024 general elections, the former Union agriculture minister said he would be meeting Congress president Sonia Gandhi and West Bengal CM Mamta Banerjee during the forthcoming winter session of parliament. “It’s not important who will lead the front, its formation is necessary. We will take people’s help.” On why he supported BJP after 2014 assembly polls, Pawar said it was with a view to create a rift between saffron alliance partners in which they succeeded. On Bollywood star Kangana Ranaut’s controversial statement, the experienced politician said some individuals had a habit to issue such “irresponsible” statements and it would be better to neglect them. “The entire world respects Mahatma Gandhi.” On whether MVA constituents would jointly fight forthcoming civic polls in the state, the NCP chief said it was not yet decided as the elections were held at local level where every party wanted to field their activists. Earlier, Pawar called on the industries and trade bodies to form a state-level federation that would meet the government at regular intervals with their grievances. “There is a need for the government to formulate a policy to compensate small shopkeepers, who always suffer losses during riots. Until regional imbalances exist, the state economy cannot progress. The state leaders need to focus on this aspect. There is a need to strengthen industries like farming for boosting the GDP,” he added. PAWAR SPEAK No clarity on contesting civic polls jointly with Congress & Shiv Sena Need to have state-level federation for industries & trade bodies It should meet government at regular intervals with grievances Better to neglect Kangana Ranaut for her ‘irresponsible’ statements Third front needed to fight BJP’s might in 2024 general elections To meet Sonia Gandhi & Mamta Banerjee during Parliament session Fadnavis shouldn’t stoop too low in desperation after losing power Injustice meted out to former minister Anil Deshmukh, who’s in jail Complainant Singh went missing & has no proof against Deshmukh NCP still follows Mahatma Gandhi & Jawaharlal Nehru’s ideologies Tripura’s repercussions should not have been felt in the state||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fadnavis-became-restless-after-losing-power-sharad-pawar/articleshow/87767566.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Delhi||Enforcement Directorate conducts searches on 9 Supertech premises||NEW DELHI: An Enforcement Directorate team on Wednesday conducted searches on nine premises belonging to the Supertech Group and its promoter chairman R K Arora in connection with a money laundering case registered against the group. TOI had reported on September 5 that the ED had initiated the process of registering a money laundering investigation against Arora and his group entities. A look out notice was simultaneously issued by the agency to prevent the promoter of the company from leaving the country till pendency of the probe. The Supertech group is facing demolition of its 40-storey twin towers in Noida after the apex court upheld a 2014 judgment of the Allahabad high court ordering the demolition by November 30 this year as it was built violating existing laws in collusion with senior officials of the Noida Authority. All the permissions related to the constructions of the twin towers were granted between 2004 and 2012. However, the Supertech chairman had claimed that there was no illegality in the construction of the twin towers and that all bye laws were followed. In a related investigation, the ED had earlier questioned former chairman and CEO of Noida authority Mohinder Singh along with six other high-ranking former officials of Noida and Greater Noida Authorities for their alleged collusion with builders. Other former officials of the Noida and Greater Noida Authority under investigation of the ED include Manoj Rai and Yashpal Tyagi, both former OSD of Noida Authority, three general manager (GM) level officers of the Greater Noida Authority and one AGM rank officer of Noida Authority. Statements of some of them have already been recorded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ed-conducts-searches-on-9-supertech-premises/articleshow/87767587.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Western Railway to have 20 more fifteen-car services||MUMBAI: Overcrowding in trains will ease a bit as the Western Railway (WR) has decided to replace 20 12-car services with 15-car trains on the slow corridor between Andheri and Virar in December. The WR has been running 46 15-car services on the corridor since April 2021. “We are going to deploy two 15-car trains that will help us run 20 more services,” WR general manager Alok Kansal said, with this, the WR will be able to run 66 15-car slow services on this stretch. Officials said that the introduction of more 15-car rakes will reduce the commuter load in the Andheri-Virar belt and increase the carrying capacity by 25% per rake. The carrying capacity of a 15-car local is 3,000 as against 2,400 of the 12-car train. Running 15-car services on slow corridor became possible between Andheri and Virar after WR spent Rs 70 crore on extending the length of 27 platforms on 14 stations to accommodate longer trains. WR introduced 15-car services between Dadar and Virar in 2009. On January 28, 2011, it extended the services till Churchgate after extending platforms 3 and 4. The 15-car trains, however, do not halt between Dadar and Churchgate due to shorter length of platforms. Officials said it is not feasible to run 15-car rakes on the slow corridor from Andheri towards south Mumbai owing to lack of space at the stations to extend the platforms. And even if the WR runs 15-car rakes, it will have to provide double halts at stations, which is not operationally feasible as it affects train punctuality. Kansal further said, “We will also introduce eight more services of AC train in a couple of days. Thus, total number of AC services on WR will increase to 20.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-wr-to-have-20-more-fifteen-car-services/articleshow/87767574.cms||Manthank Mehta

Simultaneous raid was conducted at his university office in Bodh Gaya. This is perhaps the first such case of vigilance raid against a VC. SVU ADG Nayyar Hasnain Khan said besides corruption, the VC has also been found to be in possession of movable properties of at least Rs2 crore and immovable properties worth Rs1 crore disproportionate to his known sources of income.“We will rope in passport and customs officials for investigation as how he possessed foreign currencies like pound, Australian dollar and riyal and which countries he had travelled to,” Khan said. The ADG said five bank accounts of Prasad have been frozen. “We are also searching for his bank lockers,” he said. Armed with search warrants, the SVU sleuths conducted the raids after lodging an FIR on Tuesday against the VC, his PA-cum-assistant Subodh Kumar, Veer Kunwar Singh University (VKSU) financial officer Om Prakash, Patliputra University registrar Jitendra Kumar, two private firms named M/s Poorva Graphics and Offset Printers and M/s XLICT Software Private Limited, both registered at Tilak Marg, Dali Bagh in Lucknow, UP, and other unknown persons in a case of financial irregularities worth Rs30 crore in the name of getting answer booklets, books and other items printed without any demand or need at the university. Om and Jitendra were on deputation at the MU. The SVU, in its investigation carried out till now, has also found that the printing works were allotted to favourable persons instead of inviting any tender. The SVU sleuths have also found documentary evidences of massive irregularities in recruiting private guards for the university. It is suspected that the two private firms named in the FIR are actually shell firms and were paid on the directions of the VC. Sources said several files related to purchases and guards’ recruitment were recovered from the VC’s residence, which actually should have been in his Bodh Gaya office. The SVU sleuths also came to know from the files recovered that only 47 private guards were working in the university while salaries were being disbursed to 86 guards on paper. In addition, the SVU also seized documents reflecting that remunerations paid to the 47 guards were much less than the amount withdrawn in the name of their salaries. The SVU sources said the VC got MU registrar sacked and its financial advisor and officer transferred several months ago by using his influence in the power corridors when they refused to sign documents for clearing payments. It was after their removal that Om and Jitendra were posted at the MU on deputation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/svu-books-mu-vc-for-rs30cr-fraud/articleshow/87766717.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The 27ft-long ‘baghlah’ vessel being built by M/s Haji PI Ahamed Koya Boat Builders on order from Qatari authorities is a remarkable replica of a dhow from early times as it has been built the traditional way without using even a single nail or metal piece. Instead the teak planks of the dhow are fastened by coir ropes hand sewn through the planks. “The special dhow is an attempt to recreate the dhows used by Arabs and others to sail across the world in the olden times before nails were introduced as fasteners. Qatar government authorities want to showcase their seafaring culture, and this traditional dhow will be showcased at next year’s International Dhow Festival which will coincide with the World Cup. Having the dhow built here as an exhibit during the World Cup is a matter of recognition for our centuries-old shipbuilding tradition as well,” said P O Hashim, managing director of Haji P I Ahamed Koya Boat Builders. He said that while traditional dhow-making itself was a handcrafting exercise, the dhow which is being built using coir ropes for fastening was even more laborious and intricate. “Nilambur teak planks are held together using coir ropes by making 2,500 hand stitches and 5,000 holes on teak wood. Expert workers from Ponnani have been helping our traditional artisans in the traditional technique,” Hashim added. He said that the dhow which is six-ft deep and seven-ft wide will fit inside a 40-ft container and could be shipped anywhere. “I have orders for three more such dhows from Qatar for use in their beach houses, and enquiries from Europe and US. Though it is small, six persons can travel in it,” he said, adding that the dhow will be shipped to Qatar in another two months. Hashim’s family has been into dhow building since 1885 and the company has so far built over 200 dhows to a clientele including Arab rulers, royal family members, wealthy businessmen, companies and for the tourism industry. The dhow is being built by master craftsman Gokul Edathumpadikkal and a dozen other craftsmen. “The traditional dhow making using coir ropes is being attempted after a gap of over 500 years. It is more difficult to make than other traditional dhows,” Gokul said. Fish oil will be applied to the ropes to ensure that it retains the strength when it comes in contact with seawater, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/dhow-from-koz-to-be-showcased-in-qatar-during-fifa-world-cup/articleshow/87767581.cms||---

RVNL is implementing most of the city’s Metro projects, but Metro Railway is the umbrella organization which is responsible for operations and execution of the city’s rapid transit system. A 5km section between Hemanta Mukherjee station at Ruby crossing and the Kavi Subhas terminal at Sonarpur, of the 32km Metro project which will join Kavi Subhas with Airport via EM Bypass and New Town, is veering towards commissioning next year. Even as tracks have been laid along most of the 5km viaduct, and some stations like JN Nandi at Mukundapur on EM Bypass are getting finishing touches, there’s still a 120m gap at the Avishikta crossing that is now being filled up. Joshi and his team started at 10.30am, checking out the work progress of the Kavi Subhas terminal. He inspected the rake-reversal arrangements here and visited the passenger-interchanging points between the old and new Kavi Subhas Metro stations as well as New Garia station of Eastern Railway. Kavi Subhas will be a crucial terminal where the north-south line and the New Garia-Airport lines will meet. Joshi took stock of the progress of the construction of the double discharge platforms and the carshed next to the terminal. Later, he inspected the Satyajit Ray, JN Nandi, Hemanta Mukherjee, Kavi Sukanta, Beliaghata and Salt Lake Sector V stations. Joshi also discussed the action plan for completion of work at critical locations where discontinuities of viaduct are needed to be bridged. The GM reviewed the passenger interchanging arrangements at Salt Lake Sector V station with East-West Metro.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/metro-inspection-ajanta/articleshow/87766721.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

A total of five persons tested positive for Covid-19 in Jaipur on Wednesday. One case each was reported from Chandpole, Civil Lines, Govindgarh, Mansatovar and Vaishali Nagar. In the last six days, the city has reported 46 Covid-19 cases. The order was issued by health secretary Vaidhav Galriya and it asked officials to increase Covid-19 testing. Directions have also been issued to conduct contact tracing. Officials have been asked to take random samples from crowded places, schools and hospitals, where patients are coming in with influenza-like illnesses. "We are collecting samples daily in increased numbers. We have increased it to 3,000 and we will increase it to 5,000 in coming days. We are collecting samples from schools and crowded places and conducting contact tracing as well," said Dr Narrottam Sharma, chief medical health officer (Jaipur-I). Over the past few days, areas such as C-scheme, Raja Park, Bani Park, Vaishali Nagar have been witnessing Covid-19 cases. "We collected 14 samples from the school, where two children were found infected with the virus. No one has tested positive yet from the school," said Dr Sharma. In the state, 11 persons were found infected with Covid-19 on Wednesday taking its overall tally to 9,54,550. No death was reported. The state’s toll stands at 8,954.

---||Kolkata||Health experts stress need for Cov shot to kids at the earliest||Kolkata: Inoculation of children against Covid-19 should be started at the earliest, feel health experts, especially now that schools have reopened for in-person classes. One vaccine has already received emergency use authorisation (EUA) and another one is awaiting the approval, but the government is yet to announce the roll-out of an inoculation drive for children. But with schools re-opening their campuses in phases, doctors as well as parents want vaccine protection for the paediatric population. “Morbidity and mortality from the novel coronavirus is less among children and so, adults have been given the priority in the inoculation drive. But now that schools have started re-opening, children must be administered vaccine at the earliest,” said senior paediatrician Apurba Ghosh, director at Institute of Child Health (ICH) Kolkata. While Zydus Cadila’s three-dose ZyCov-D has received authorization for children between 12 and 18 years, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin has been recommended for EUA for children above 2 years by the subject expert committee. The vaccine is still awaiting the final nod from the drug regulator. “Re-opening of educational institutes was much needed. But even a single child contracting the novel coronavirus will lead to panic among parents and might again cause suspension of physical classes. We need to provide vaccine protection to children as fast as possible,” said IPGMER hepatolgy head Abhijit Chowdhury, also a member of Bengal’s Global Advisory Board for Covid-19 Response. Paediatricians and hospitals are already flooded with enquiries about vaccination for children. “Almost 100% parents are keen on their children getting the jab. Since the adults have received the shots, they are aware of the benefits. Being away from classrooms for a long period was causing chldren psychological issues. But as schools have started reopening in phases, it is high time children were administered the vaccine,” said ICH professor Jaydeep Choudhury, the co-investigator in the ZyCov-D clinical trial at ICH. Swasthya Bhawan official feel the health ministry may announce the roll-out of the paediatric inoculation drive only after Covaxin receives the sanction. State health officials said they were ready for the roll-out and were waiting for the guidelines. “In Bengal, about 2.45 crore children above 2 years will be eligible for th vaccine. Our infrastructure is ready. We only need the guideline on certain issues, like the type of vaccine and the procurement procedure,” said state family welfare officer Asim Das Malakar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/health-experts-stress-need-for-cov-shot-to-kids-at-the-earliest/articleshow/87767636.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

He is one among seven other speakers from the country which include Rajasthan’s C P Joshi, Meghalaya’s Metbah Lyngdoh, Girish Gautam of Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu’s M Appavu and Biswajit Daimary of Assam. Mahto addressed the 82nd conference in Shimla on Wednesday and highlighted some of the achievements of Jharkhand assembly besides proposing to host national youth parliament here. Excerpts from his statement. Our Founding Fathers of the nation gifted us an outstanding Constitution that paved the way for a democratic India. We must never forget that millions of brave men and women fought their way for our beloved nation’s independence. As an institution, legislatures have the utmost responsibility to uphold the democracy in our nation. We have witnessed a consistent trend over the years that the functioning period of legislatures has reduced considerably compared to the early decades of Indian independence. Legislatures are an important pillar of the nation’s foundation. The reduced functioning of the legislatures may not augur well for the overall stature and role that the legislative institutions are supposed to play in nation building. As elected representatives, our utmost responsibility is towards the people of the country who have sent us to the legislature to work towards ensuring the progress of our society and country. The Jharkhand legislative assembly, in the short span of 21 years, has put forth various examples of innovations in parliamentary practices. Chief Minister’s Question Hour is one such innovation where members can ask questions on policy matters directly to the chief minister. Untouched questions committee has been formed to take up the questions which could not be asked on the floor of the house due to the paucity of time. Provision for a government assurance committee is also made to look into the assurances made on the floor of the house. Benefits of these innovations are clearly felt by the members in raising questions of public importance and leading them up to a final conclusive culmination. As speaker, I had set out three priorities — to utilise the maximum time of the session, making it more efficient and productive. For this purpose, apart from other efforts, we are also trying to implement e-vidhan in our assembly as early as possible. Efforts are being made by my secretariat in this direction and we are getting required support from the central and state governments. I have also decided to bring the house proceedings and other activities of the assembly before the common people. Taking this objective into account, I have started Jharkhand Vidhan Sabha TV on YouTube and I am constantly trying to make it better and more beneficial to the people. I have also decided to make our younger generations more aware about our parliamentary procedures, so that on the one hand they will have greater faith in our democratic principles, and on the other, it will inculcate leadership qualities in them. Towards this goal we organised a Chhatra Sansad in our assembly in which actual house proceedings were conducted by the students. They ran question hour and a bill was introduced and passed by their assembly too. To signify the importance of environment, the theme of the event was ‘Youth for Green Jharkhand’ and the bill that was passed by this assembly was the Tree Conservation Bill. This house was also gender equal as more than 50% of participants were female. We have sent a proposal to organise an all-India event starting with 10 states in the first round. I hope we will get the Hon’ble Speaker’s consent for it.

The state department of forests, environment and wildlife has set rolling a plan to develop its sprawling 540 acre biodiversity park in Lalkhatanga on the outskirts of the state capital into an ecotourism site of international standards. Last month, the office of Ranchi divisional forest officer (DFO) floated an expression of interest (EoI) inviting consultancy firms across the country to chalk up a plan for developing the park. As per the department sources, a consultancy firm based in New Delhi has been shortlisted through a technical bidding process. Ranchi DFO Ashok Dubey said, “Since the vision is to develop the park into an ecotourism site of international standards, it needs technical expertise. A firm has been shortlisted and a proposal for appointing it has been sent to the government.” Forest officials said the planning for developing the park into an ecotourism site began after chief minister Hemant Soren visited the facility earlier this year. “After taking a tour of the park, the CM instructed the department officials to consider developing the park and its surrounding areas into an ecotourism site complete with adventure sports and tourism,” a senior department official said. The park, which is over a decade old, is home to several indigenous and medicinal plant varieties. Primarily maintained by the department for educational purposes, the park is a popular getaway destination for locals and tourists. “If it becomes an ecotourism centre, the park will become a popular attraction for tourists both from Jharkhand and other parts of the country. It will also contribute to the local economy and provide livelihood to those living in its vicinity,” Dubey said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/forest-dept-eyes-540-acre-ecotourism-site-in-ranchi/articleshow/87766214.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||Air quality of four Jharkhand cities categorised as ‘very unhealthy’||Ranchi: People in major cities of Jharkhand are suffering from allergies, runny nose and irritation of respiratory tract but are clueless about the reasons. Medical experts are also not in a position to officially link them with air pollution in the absence of scientific data. The air quality index (AQI) monitor near Van Bhavan in Ranchi recorded PM10 levels at 143.61 and PM2.5 at 84.84 on Wednesday around 4 pm. Under medical standards, AQI in the range of 100-149 is considered unhealthy while it is classified as extremely unhealthy in the range of 150-249 followed by “dangerous” in the range of 250 and above. In contrast to levels recorded at the AQI monitor of Jharkhand state pollution control board, private agencies monitoring the levels pegged all the parameters at a very high level. According to Accuweather which collects information from France-based plume labs, monitoring air quality on a regular basis, Ranchi recorded AQI 215 on Wednesday, categoried as “very unhealthy”. The PM2.5 at 191, was also poor while NoX (nitrogen oxides) and ground-level ozone were found to be in fair category in the range of 45 and 36 respectively. AQI in Jamshedpur was recorded at 207, while in Bokaro and Dhanbad it was 193 and 184 respectively. In all the four cities, particulate matters both in the PM10 and PM 2.5 category were at concerning levels while carbon monoxide levels were in “excellent” category. Ashish Sheetal, general secretary of Yugantar Bharti, an NGO working in the field of environment conservation, said the disparity in AQI levels is mainly due to unscientific installation of the monitoring equipment. “The AQI depends on which sample of air is being monitored. We recommend three monitors placed at triangle to monitor the air of a particular area so that a big sample of air is monitored instead of single monitor which can miss real sample if the wind direction is blowing away from the monitor,” he said. Asked what explains lower SOX, NOX and CO levels, mostly attributed to vehicular and industrial pollutants but higher range of PM10 and PM2.5 pollutants in the cities of Jharkhand, Sheetal said a lot comes from construction work and unpaved road sides adding to dust in the air. “Vehicular and industrial pollution also adds to PM2.5 and PM10 pollutants but coal mines and stone crushers are the major culprits,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/air-quality-of-four-jharkhand-cities-categorised-as-very-unhealthy/articleshow/87766186.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Ranchi||JMM protests outside Tata Factories in Jamshedpur||Jamshedpur: Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) workers staged a protest outside three Tata-owned units on Wednesday over a recent proposal of Tata Cummins to shift its tax jurisdiction to Pune in Maharashtra. JMM workers blocked the entrance gates of Tata Motors plant in Telco, Tata Steel plant in Bistupur, Tata Growth shop in Gamharia and Tata Steel Long Products Limited (TSPL) iron ore mines in Noamundi for 12 hours besides staging demonstrations outside Tata Cummins. The party workers were led by nine incumbent JMM legislators from Kolhan division. During the peaceful sit-in, JMM demanded that Tata Sons shift its corporate head offices to Jamshedpur from Mumbai. JMM lawmaker Ramdas Soren said: “Factories are operating here. So the headquarters should also be based here as it will fetch Jharkhand better revenues.” Baharagora MLA Sanjiv Sardar demanded that the conglomerate should fill up its vacancies by employing the adivasis and moolvasis of the state. Jugsalai MLA Mangal Kalindi said: “At present, Tata Motors and several other companies procure ancillary products from other states depriving work to the local ancillary units.” The party leadership also appealed to Tata Cummins not to shift its PAN (permanent account number) jurisdiction. JMM workers staged protest with bows, arrows and party banners and raised slogans. They were served khichdi and vegetables during lunch hours. The party had provisioned khichdi for 20,000 participants, a local worker said. The conglomerate did not issue any statement till evening. The East Singhbhum administration, however, had pressed in a large number of police personnel and riot-control vehicles at the protest sites. SSP M Tamil Vanan said that adequate security arrangements have been made for the gate jaam protest. While Tata Group remained silent, local entrepreneurs reacted sharply to Wednesday’s protests. “At a time when the state government is making renewed efforts to fetch big ticket investments in the state, the protests will not send a good signal to the prospective investors,” Adityapur Small Industries Association (ASIA) president Santosh Khetan said. The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) sought chief minister Hemant Soren’s intervention into the Tata Cummins issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jmm-protests-outside-tata-factories-in-jamshedpur/articleshow/87766278.cms||B Sridhar

The sexagenarian Maoist leader, who has been active in the ultra Left wing for more than three decades, suffered from convulsions soon after being detained by police. The couple was taken to Seraikela Sadar hospital for a medical check-up on November 14 before being produced in the sub-divisional judicial magistrate’s court. Doctors advised her to go for a thorough checkup and treatment at Rims. Public relations officer at Rims DK Sinha confirmed that Sheela had an epileptic episode following which she was brought to the hospital. “She has been admitted to the medicine ward and kept under police security. Some of the tests were conducted and further treatment would be decided by the doctors,” he said. Sheela, accused in more than a dozen criminal cases, has been booked under sections 420, 467,468 and 471 of the IPC along with section 17 of Criminal Law Amendment Act and sections 10 and 13 of Unlawful Activities Prevention Act in the recent case registered with Kandra police station. At present, she is in police remand of seven days.

At first, Ajay Parmar thought that it was a baby crocodile but soon he realised that it was something else. Parmar was thrilled as what he had spotted turned out to be an otter in the middle of the lake. “I have been visiting this wetland for the last two decades to watch and click birds. This is for the first time that an otter has been spotted at Wadhwana. It was a delight to watch a freshwater otter swim in the lake,” Parmar, who photographed the otter along with Ankit Shah, told TOI. “Otters have been spotted in Mahi and even Narmada but never has this mammal been spotted at this lake,” he said. Otters are carnivorous mammals that feed on fishes, crabs and frogs. Efficient hunters, freshwater otters have webbed feet and a long flat tail that helps it propel through the water. “Though I saw just one otter, I feel that it must be having its family around. Narmada is connected to Wadhwana so it is possible that the otter must have swam through the canal to this lake,” Parmar added. “The otter, even if a loner, may stay in the lake for a long time as the wetland is a good source of food. I managed to get a few clicks when the adult otter climbed on a little island for a while before slipping away in the waters,” he said. Avid bird watcher, Kartik Upadhyay said that he too never heard of an otter being seen at Wadhwana in all the years that he visited the wetland.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/freshwater-otter-clicked-at-wadhwana-birders-claim-first-sighting-at-wetland/articleshow/87766375.cms||Tushar Tere

In my opinion, the missionaries contribute as much as 50% to the state’s education system,” Soren said in his address as the chief guest at the 50th anniversary of Ranchi’s Gossner College. “I, along with my brothers (deceased former Jama legislator Durga Soren and incumbent Dumka MLA Basant Soren), studied for some time in a missionary school in Dumka during the 1980s. We stayed at the school hostel. Though I lived in cities like New Delhi, Bokaro, Ranchi and Patna, memories from the mission school days are still fresh in my mind,” Soren said. Gossner College, which is run by the Gossner Evalgelical Lutheran church, was founded in 1972. It currently has 27 departments. Together with Gossner school, it imparts education to roughly 9,000 students. Soren said: “Covid-19 has affected the education of the children. The world switched to online classes. During the pandemic, the missionaries went the extra mile to lend a helping hand to the tribal communities living in the hinterlands of the state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/missionaries-contribution-to-jharkhands-education-pivotal-hemant/articleshow/87766311.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||GTDC appoints new service provider for multimodal tours||Panaji: After a successful bidding process, Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC) has appointed M/s Prive Property Management Pvt Ltd, to conduct multimodal experiential tours in the state. These will include activities such as hop-on-hop-off buses and amphibious tour vehicles. While a hop-on-hop-off bus was operational until the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, GTDC’s plan to introduce amphibious vehicles, that operate on sea as well as land, was delayed owing to difficulties faced by the previous service provider in getting mandatory permissions. Now that a new service provider has been selected, GTDC expects to make both services operational during the current season. A tourism official said the hop-on-hop-off service had slowly become quite popular among domestic tourists. A significant number of foreign tourists, too, were seen using the service. A ride on the double decker bus, that offered an air conditioned and an open sky section, was a fun trip for many and a different experience from the coaches or buses that offer tours. “The beauty of this service is that passengers can decide their itinerary. The elements of flexibility and choice make a difference,” he said. Now with the tourism season looking promising, and with the overall pandemic situation largely under control, he said they are hoping to have the bus back on the road soon. The official said that had their plan for the amphibious bus service succeeded in 2016, Goa would have become the first state to have introduced it. However, even after having a trial, the service provider was unable to start the services due to problems in obtaining permissions from various authorities. “With it being a new kind of service in India then, government authorities were reluctant to give permission,” he said. Power Minister Nilesh Cabral, who was the GTDC chairperson then, had tried very hard to get the new service moving.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gtdc-appoints-new-service-provider-for-multimodal-tours/articleshow/87767661.cms||---
---||India||Supreme Court names retired judge of Punjab and Haryana HC to monitor Kheri probe||NEW DELHI: "To ensure transparency, fairness and absolute impartiality" in the investigations into the Lakhimpur Kheri incidents resulting in eight deaths, the Supreme Court on Wednesday appointed retired Punjab and Haryana HC judge Rakesh Kumar Jain to supervise the probe and reconstituted the Special Investigation Team (SIT) by inducting three senior IPS officers. A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli said, "While investigating such offences, justice must not only be done, but also be seen and perceived to be done. We, thus, deem it appropriate to reconstitute the SIT hereafter to preserve the faith and trust of people in the administration of the justice system." It appointed UP cadre IPS officer S B Shiradkar, who is a native of Nanded in Maharashtra, to head the SIT and drafted in two other UP-cadre IPS officers, also hailing from outside the state, to the probe team. "Further, to assure full and complete justice to the victims of crime, we are inclined to order that the ongoing investigation be monitored by a retired HC Judge, who too may not have his roots in Uttar Pradesh. We, therefore, appoint Justice (retd) Rakesh Kumar Jain of the P&H HC to monitor the ongoing investigation so as to ensure transparency, fairness and absolute impartiality in the outcome of the investigation into the Lakhimpur Kheri incident which is to be conducted in a time bound manner." The CJI-led bench said it would post the matter for further hearing after Justice Jain submits a status report subsequent to the SIT filing chargesheets in the three separate incidents on October 3, which the court described in this manner - "Several protesters had been blocking the road to restrict passage for the UP Deputy Chief Minister who was on his way to Banbirpur village. While standing and/or walking on the road, these protesters were rammed from behind by a Mahindra Thar SUV, and then run over by the same vehicle. Two other vehicles that were part of the same convoy also ran over those who had already been thrown to the ground and crushed by the first SUV. The incident resulted in eight deaths and several suffered injuries." Four farmers were mowed down by the vehicles leading to an angry mob lynching three accused persons. A journalist too was murdered. SC during the last hearing had expressed dissatisfaction over the composition of the SIT, which predominantly consisted of middle level/subordinate level police officers, and had sought names of directly recruited IPS officers of UP cadre who are not natives of the state. Apart from Shiradkar, the CJI-led bench inducted Padmaja Chauhan and Preetinder Singh in the SIT. The bench justified its decision to reconstitute the SIT by saying, "It appears to us that in spite of their (existing members of SIT) perceived commitment and sincerity in carrying out the investigation, there may still be a lurking suspicion in respect of the fairness and independence of such an investigation. We, therefore, deem it appropriate to direct re­constitution of the SIT infused with directly recruited IPS officers who do not hail from Uttar Pradesh, though are allocated to UP Cadre." "The newly constituted SIT shall be free to seek assistance from, and/or associate with or include the local police of Lakhimpur Kheri for taking the ongoing investigations to its logical conclusion under the continuous monitoring of Justice Jain. The SIT shall make all efforts to conclude the investigation expeditiously and file the charge­sheet... It goes without saying that the SIT shall utilize the latest forensic investigative methods to reach the truth," the bench ordered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-names-retired-judge-of-punjab-and-haryana-hc-to-monitor-kheri-probe/articleshow/87768991.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Councillors Archana Dangui and Jaya Sawant are in fray. A no-trust motion was moved against Dhavlikar by eight councillors of the 15-member body on October 11. However, the council had referred the decision to director of municipal administration (DMA) Gurudas Pilarnkar who termed the motion as defeated on October 13. In his order, Pilarnkar stated that since there were only seven councillors out of the 15-member council, the motion could not seek a majority. He said it was necessary that all eight members should have been present for the special meeting to vote on the motion. The BJP-led Ponda Nagrik Samiti had rewarded Virendra Dhavlikar with the post of PMC deputy chairperson on October 21, 2020. Orally it was decided that he would vacate the chair in six months and allow other colleagues an opportunity to become vice-chairperson. However, he did not vacate the chair for about a year, following which the motion was moved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ponda-council-to-elect-new-deputy-today/articleshow/87767798.cms||---

---||World||Pakistan parliament passes bill giving Kulbhushan Jadhav right to file review appeal against conviction||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s parliament passed a bill at a joint session on Wednesday providing Kulbhushan Jadhav, the Indian prisoner on death row, the right to file a review appeal against his conviction by a military court. The law brings into effect the 2019 judgment of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which asked Pakistan to give India consular access to Jadhav and also provide him right of review and reconsideration against his conviction and sentence. The ICJ gave its judgment on July 17, 2019. However, no progress has been made on the review issue as India refused to appoint a local lawyer while demanding Pakistan to let an Indian lawyer represent Jadhav in the court. Despite Pakistan’s parliament passing the bill, the issue is likely to remain deadlocked till Islamabad allows New Delhi to appoint a lawyer of its choice to represent Jadhav. Pakistan has been alleging that India is engaging in a campaign to obfuscate the issue of appointing a lawyer to represent Jadhav. The ICJ (Review and Re-consideration) Bill, 2020, was moved by Pakistan’s law minister Farogh Nasim and passed with a majority vote. The statement of objects and reasons of the bill stated that the government of India had initiated proceedings against Pakistan in the ICJ concerning alleged violations of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations in the matter of the detention and trial of Jadhav, who was sentenced to death in April 2017 for espionage. In order to give full effect to the said judgment, according to the bill, it is necessary that a mechanism for review and reconsideration of Pakistan’s own choice be provided. The bill providing Jadhav the right to appeal against his conviction was passed by the National Assembly in June this year. However, it failed to get the nod of the Senate. A joint session of the parliament is called when the differences between the two Houses are unbridgeable. While the ruling coalition led by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf has a majority in the National Assembly, it does not have the numbers in the Upper House. Jadhav, according to Pakistan, was arrested on March 3, 2016, from Balochistan’s Mashkhel area. New Delhi, however, claimed that he was a retired Indian Navy officer and was abducted by Pakistani operators from Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running his business. His appeals against his conviction had been rejected by the military’s court of appeal. On India’s appeal, the ICJ had stopped Pakistan from carrying out the capital punishment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistan-parliament-passes-bill-giving-jadhav-right-to-file-review-appeal-against-conviction/articleshow/87766847.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

---||World||Allegations that Mountbatten influenced India-Pakistan boundary at Partition raised in London tribunal||LONDON: A question mark has been raised at a tribunal in London over the impartiality of Lord Mountbatten and whether he sought to interfere with the boundary drawn between India and Pakistan at Partition. The allegations were made during a first-tier tribunal (information rights) hearing as to whether all the private diaries of and correspondence between Lord and Lady Mountbatten — held by the University of Southampton within the Broadlands archives — should be made public. Clara Hamer, representing British author Andrew Lownie, who has written a book on the Mountbattens and is seeking full disclosure of the Mountbatten papers, told the tribunal that Lord Mountbatten’s diary entry on July 12, 1947 reveals that he had dinner with British judge Sir Cyril Radcliffe, the chair of the Boundary Commission, and Christopher Beaumont, its secretary, but his diary entry from the day after has been redacted on the basis that it could prejudice the UK’s relations with India and Pakistan. Hamer said: "The issue of whether Mountbatten was impartial and the fact he met with Radcliffe and Beaumont on that date is a matter of importance as this was a time he was not supposed to be having contact with them and this could be evidence of a lack of impartiality by Lord Mountbatten. I would want to ask whether what is redacted on July 13, 1947 is linked to dinner the night before and is to do with drawing up of the boundary of Pakistan. And, if it is, there is a very strong public interest in full transparency on that issue." Hamer also questioned why Mountbatten’s diary entry from August 6, 1947 — one week before Independence — has been redacted. "This would be of particular public interest and importance for historians wishing to understand events at the time of independence," she said. She said Lownie had taken an educated guess that that was a meeting of the joint defence council, which Mountbatten would have attended. On Wednesday retired archivist and curator at the University of Southampton Library, Professor Chris Woolgar, defended his decision to alert the Cabinet Office to "highly sensitive" materials within the Mountbatten papers, which were about the royal family or were related to India and Pakistan, which he spotted after receiving them, which led to them being closed off. The tribunal heard that the Cabinet Office responded to his email within three hours agreeing certain files should be closed, saying, "The material relating to India and Pakistan is especially sensitive from this period." The Broadlands Archive, made up of 4,500 boxes, which include 47 volumes of Lord Mountbatten’s diaries and 36 volumes of Lady Mountbatten’s diaries, was held at Broadlands House, the Mountbatten family estate near Romsey, and was transferred to the university in more than eight lorries between the 1980s and 2010. In 2011, the university purchased the Broadlands Archive from the trustees using several million pounds of public money. Lownie is also seeking disclosure of correspondence between Lady Mountbatten and Jawaharlal Nehru, which is also in storage at Southampton, but Southampton says it does not own it and is simply storing it, even though it has an option to purchase them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/allegations-that-mountbatten-influenced-india-pakistan-boundary-at-partition-raised-in-london-tribunal/articleshow/87766899.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||India||Resignations in Jammu and Kashmir Congress over party unit chief||JAMMU/SRINAGAR: Four former ministers and three ex-legislators of Congress in Jammu and Kashmir were among several senior members to resign on Wednesday from party posts, alleging that their suggestions and opinion on party affairs were seldom sought or heard. They are said to be close to Ghulam Nabi Azad, the former leader of the opposition in Rajya Sabha, who is among 23 top Congress politicians to make similar allegations in a letter to the party leadership last year. They held Congress’s J&K unit chief GA Mir responsible for the crisis and wrote in their resignation letter that the 'hostile attitude' of the party leadership in the Union territory compelled them to step down from all party posts. For his part, Mir said he has not received any resignation and those members “are not holding any position in the party” other than being legislators in the past. He said they have never communicated their resentment, either to Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi when they met him in Jammu last month or to AICC’s state in-charge Rajni Patil. Mir called the latest political drama a conspiracy by “some top Delhi-based Congress leader” trying to blackmail the high command for an important position in the party. The prominent names from Wednesday’s resignations include GM Saroori, Jugal Kishore Sharma, Waqar Rasool, Dr Manohar Lal Sharma, Ghulam Nabi Monga, Naresh Gupta, Subash Gupta, Amin Bhat, Anwar Bhat and Inayat Ali. They said Congress high command was informed several times that Mir “doesn’t carry the desired respect and reputation for this coveted post”, but no action was taken. According to sources a request to remove him was presented to Rahul Gandhi during his Jammu visit, but it was not taken seriously. They said more than 200 top Congress members, including former ministers, MLAs, MLCs, PCC office bearers, district presidents and AICC functionaries, have quit and joined other parties over the past several months. Reacting to the mass resignation in Congress, former deputy chief minister Kavinder Gupta of BJP said the party in J&K will collapse because of infighting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/resignations-in-jammu-and-kashmir-congress-over-party-unit-chief/articleshow/87766957.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||World||Overseas Pakistanis get voting rights as Pakistan parliament passes new law||ISLAMABAD: Amid strong protests by the opposition, the Imran Khan-led coalition government in Pakistan managed to bulldoze amendments to the Elections Act, 2017 in the joint session of parliament on Wednesday, thereby allowing the use of electronic voting machines (EVMs) and granting voting rights to overseas Pakistanis. In protest, the opposition tore copies of the agenda and staged a walkout, chanting slogans against the PM and his government. The opposition and treasury members almost came to blows when the former tried to stop the proceedings of the joint session. Imran’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) is considered to be the sole beneficiary if overseas Pakistanis are able to vote through internet. There are approximately 9 million Pakistanis living outside the country and the incumbent prime minister is said to very popular among them. The voting turnout of overseas nationals is also believed to be much higher than in Pakistan. “The new laws were passed to steal the next elections,” Jamaat-i-Islami chief Sirajul Haq said. At the start of the parliament session, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) president and leader of the opposition in the National Assembly, Shehbaz Sharif, termed EVMs “evil and vicious machines” and accused the government of not being sincere in creating a consensus on electoral reforms. Sharif claimed that the “selected government” wanted to introduce EVMs because it can no longer ask the people for votes. “There are always allegations of rigging during the elections. This is the first time in history that there are allegations of rigging before the elections,” he said. Pakistan Peoples Party chief Bilwal Bhutto Zardari said it was the first time in the history of Pakistan that a government tried to bring “unilateral” electoral reforms. Speaking about the EVM, he said even the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has rejected it after raising serious objections over the machine. He said the PPP will challenge the new laws in the Supreme Court. The ECP had earlier referred to various issues linked with the use of EVM, including lack of ballot secrecy, lack of capacity at all levels and lack of ensuring security and chain of custody for the machines at rest and during transportation. It also pointed out that there would be no evidence available in case of election dispute. The ECP had noted that data integration and configuration issues may crop up due to court orders at the eleventh hour regarding a change in ballot paper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/overseas-pakistanis-get-voting-rights-as-pak-parliament-passes-new-law/articleshow/87767003.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

Farooq Abbullah said the impact of such killings and the subsequent "culture of impunity" would have a depressing impact on the public psyche. "The contrasting versions of the killings have sent a wave of fear across Kashmir. Varying versions have raised misgivings among the people, particularly the bereaved families," Farooq Abdullah told the LG. "Apprehensions have been raised by the victims’ families on the veracity of claims made by the police and its investigative agencies. It is, therefore, incumbent upon the J&K administration to ensure that there was no foul play involved and ensure that the bereaved families’ version is heard and respected," he said. PDP president Mehbooba Mufti said in Jammu on Wednesday that Kashmiris had never surrendered at gunpoint and would not do so now. "Kashmiris won’t surrender by committing atrocities on them. The only solution to this issue is a dialogue with Kashmiris. Their issues need to addressed constitutionally, and not through oppression," she said. Mehbooba claimed that nobody knew whether or not a militant was slain in Hyderpora but it was clear that three civilians had been killed in the encounter. "They were innocent people whose families are urging the authorities to return their bodies. Their little kids are waiting for their fathers to come. A helper, a doctor and a businessman were killed, and now the authorities are not even returning their bodies to their families," she said. Referring to IGP (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar’s claim that they had digital evidence against those killed, she said, "If they had prior evidence, why did the police not arrest them, as they have been doing on a daily basis?" She added: "Whenever someone gets killed in firing, the police label them as OGWs. All their claims are false. The forces didn’t have any explanation to these killings so now they are labelling them as OGWs or militant associates and hybrid militants. All three were innocent people…" she said. Mehbooba, a former J&K CM, said since the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, or AFSPA, has been in force, there has been no accountability for the killing of innocents. Earlier, in February 2018, Mehbooba Mufti had ruled out the revocation of AFSPA and had said the Indian Army was the most disciplined force in the world. "This cruel government is not even handing over the bodies after killing people. They want to convert this nation of Gandhi, Nehru, and Ambedkar into a country of Godse. What else can I say," the PDP chief said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/farooq-abdullah-demands-impartial-probe-into-hyderpora-civilian-killings-mehbooba-says-kashmiris-wont-surrender-to-oppression/articleshow/87767049.cms||M Saleem Pandit

IGP (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar said TRF district commander Afaq Sikander was among the five slain terrorists. Three terrorists were killed in Pombai and two in Gopalpora, he said, in operations that were based on tip-offs from informers. The encounters were triggered on Wednesday afternoon when joint teams comprising police and CRPF personnel launched cordon-and-search operations in the two areas and the militants fired at the forces when they started closing in. The Pombai gunfight began first and the terrorists killed there had not yet been identified. The TRF’s Afaq Sikander was among the two terrorists killed in the Gopalpura area, Kumar said. The police and CRPF, meanwhile, arrested two men linked to the Lashker-e-Taiba in south Kashmir's Pulwama district and recovered IEDs from them. A police statement said the two terrorist associates were identified as Amir Bashir Dar of Sirnoo, in Pulwama, and Mukhtar Ahmad Bhat of Matri Bugh, Shopian. In a third incident on Wednesday, two CRPF men and two civilians were injured when terrorists threw a hand grenade at Palhalan chowk, in north Kashmir's Baramulla district. All the injured were shifted to a nearby hospital for treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/five-terrorists-including-district-trf-commander-killed-in-twin-encounters-in-kulgam/articleshow/87767101.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Almost every Sunday a major tournament is held at the Jaipur Polo Grounds now, and the number of guests increases with each match. Last Sunday, the final of the MP Cup Polo Championship (Sir Pratap Singh Cup) 2021 was held at the ground, and it was hosted by Meenakshi Lekhi, Minister of State for External Affairs and Culture. Ritu Beri and Meenakshi Lekhi Sangeeta Saxena and Vinai Kumar Saxena, Chairman, KVIC, Sunjay Kapur and Priya Sachdev Kapur and Shivani Wazir PasrichRegulars are back at the polo ground:Returning to the polo ground was nostalgic for many guests, who were attending polo matches after almost two years. “It is nostalgic for me to be here after so many years. I am attending my first match of the season, and it is so good to see all this action here. There was a time when my Sundays were reserved to be spent at the polo ground, during the polo season,” said Shivani Wazir Pasrich, who had come to watch the match with her husband Amir Pasrich, who is also a polo player. Freddy Svane, Danish Ambassador, Mariana Pacheco, Colombian Ambassador, and Juan Angulo, Chilean Ambassador (L to R) Diplomats’ day out:The match was attended by many diplomats, too. Some of them shared how polo matches are the perfect place to meet their fellow diplomats and spend a leisurely Sunday. “I have been in India for nine months now, and this is the first time that I attended a polo match. I really liked it here. Usually, I spend my Sundays taking a walk in the beautiful parks here, exploring new restaurants, but attending this match was a great experience,” said Mariana Pacheco, Colombian Ambassador. Artistes from the North East performed after the match A special North Eastern act:The nail-biting match, where a player was even injured after falling off his pony, was followed by several cultural performances. “Very few would know that polo originated in India, and Manipur is the place, where it is said that it was first played. This is the reason why we had special performances by the artistes from the North East. We wanted to show our diversity and culture. This game showcases our sporting heritage,” said Lekhi.

---||India||Recurrent pollution crisis is due to inertia of officials: SC||NEW DELHI: In a severe indictment of the officialdom, the Supreme Court on Wednesday said the recurring problem of pollution in Delhi and NCR is mainly because bureaucracy has developed inertia, wanting the courts to douse farm fires and curb polluting industries, rather than take adequate measures round the year to rein in major sources of pollutants, such as industries, vehicles and dust. A bench of Chief Justice NV Ramana and Justices DY Chandrachud and Surya Kant ordered strict implementation of the slew of decisions taken on Tuesday at the court-ordered emergency meeting of the Commission on Air Quality Management in NCR and adjoining areas, involving senior officials of the Centre and governments of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. Recounting his two-decade-long experience with bureaucracy while functioning as a constitutional court judge, and previously as advocate general of Andhra Pradesh, CJI Ramana said, “In general, over a period of time, what I have observed is both at the Centre and in states, the bureaucracy has developed an inexplicable inertia and apathy. They don’t want to take any decision. (In the pollution case) they want the courts to pick up buckets of water and douse the farm fires. They want the courts to catch polluting vehicles and industries. All these things the courts have to do. This is the attitude developed by the executive.” When a reference to allegations of the Centre “misleading” the court on farm fires came up, the bench said it has stated all facts in its affidavit and did not misrepresent matters. The CJI said, “It is common sense that farm fires in two months every year increase pollution levels in Delhi and NCR. We understand the plight of the farmers and do not want to penalise them. Yet, we have asked the state governments concerned to persuade the farmers not to burn stubble for two weeks. There is no point in raising the issue of farm fires again and again.” The court wondered why the executive is waiting for a court order to call for the emergency meeting: “Why were these decisions not taken earlier by the executive? Why does the Supreme Court have to set an agenda, force officials of the Centre and states to meet, and take emergent steps to curb pollution? “On Tuesday, the meeting took place. Why can’t the officers summarise the minutes of the meeting and clearly inform the court — these are things which have been decided, these have been implemented, these are the other measures required to be taken and then specify what directions have been issued to achieve the target on the ground,” the CJI said. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said it is the solemn duty of the Centre and states and every official to earnestly take all steps to implement the decisions taken at the meeting of the Commission. When this failed to assuage the SC’s angst, Mehta attempted to lighten the mood by narrating a poignant yet humorous fictional account of how bureaucracy acts. But it was off-target. The CJI said, “It is unfortunate that the executive has come to this pass. The bureaucracy does not want to do anything. They do not want to pass any orders. All they want is — let the court prepare draft measures. Let the court pass orders. Once the Supreme Court passes an order, they will simply put their signature on executive order saying it is as per the directions of the SC.” The SG narrated another humorous story about bureaucracy and succeeded in stopping the torrent of caustic observations. He then detailed the decisions taken at the meeting before the bench. On Delhi, the bench questioned the AAP government on augmentation of road-sweeping machines. Senior advocate AM Singhvi said the municipal corporations have placed a requirement of 15 such machines and the Delhi government has agreed to release funds and procure these for municipal corporations immediately. “Delhi ticks 90% of the measures decided to be taken at the Tuesday meeting and is ready to do everything that is required for bringing down the pollution levels,” Singhvi said. The bench asked whether 15 more machines were enough to sweep 8,500km of roads in Delhi, which at present has 69 such machines. Singhvi said the government is ready to procure more machines as and when the demands are raised by civic bodies. However, he touched a raw nerve by blaming the farm fires while petitioner’s counsel Vikas Singh stressed that during the two winter months, farm fires contributed more than 40% towards the pollution in Delhi and accused the Centre of misleading the court by stating that it was only 4-10%. The solicitor general said he has stated all facts and mentioned farm fires contributing majorly during the two winter months but scientific studies indicate that on an annual basis, the contribution is 4%. Piggybacking on the SC’s “common sense” comment, the SG interjected in a lighter vein: “Common sense is like a deodorant. Those who do not use it, make others suffer.” The bench told the Delhi government and the petitioner, “If you persist with farm fires, it will force us to make comments and create a controversy which would completely derail the main issue — how to curb pollution from all major sources. What have you done to implement SC orders banning firecrackers? For the last 10 days, cracker bursting has been taking place in every area of Delhi and NCR. Can you say firecrackers do not cause pollution?” The SG said central government employees have not been asked to ‘work from home' as the number of vehicles used by them is minuscule. “Normalcy in work at central government offices has come back after a long hiatus caused by the pandemic. Asking employees to WFH would have a pan-India impact.” The Delhi government said it has adopted WFH policy for its employees. The bench suggested to the Centre that since there are a large number of colonies where most central government officials and personnel reside, the Centre could think of engaging buses to ferry them to and from office. The SG said the Centre would sincerely attempt to implement this suggestion of the court. The SG said that the Met department has predicted that the wind speed would pick up after November 21 and that pollution would get considerably reduced. The bench said, “When the executive and bureaucracy do not work, we have to depend on nature and God’s mercy.” It posted the matter for further hearing on November 24 for stock-taking of steps taken by the Centre and NCR states to bring down pollution levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/recurrent-pollution-crisis-is-due-to-inertia-of-officials-sc/articleshow/87767623.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||World||Steve Bannon pleads not guilty to Capitol riot probe charges||WASHINGTON: Former president Donald Trump advisor Steve Bannon entered a "not guilty" plea Wednesday after his arrest on charges of contempt of Congress for refusing to testify on the January 6 attack on the Capitol.  One day ahead of the first hearing scheduled in his case, Bannon entered the plea in a federal district court in Washington, without explaining the grounds for his plea.  In October Bannon rejected a subpoena to testify to the House special committee investigating the attack by hundreds of Trump supporters on the US legislature.  The House then referred the contempt charges to the Justice Department, where a grand jury reviewed the case and voted to indict him on two counts.  Investigators believe Bannon and other advisors to Trump could have information on links between the White House and the mob that invaded the Capitol, on the day it was due to certify Joe Biden as winner of the November 2020 presidential election.  Although he was not a White House employee or official Trump advisor, Bannon's attorneys said he was protected by presidential privilege and did not have to cooperate with the committee.  If convicted, each contempt charge could bring one month to one year in jail, and a fine of up to $100,000.  Bannon surrendered to the FBI on Monday and vowed to fight the case.  He accused President Joe Biden of having "ordered" the Justice Department to prosecute him.  "I'm never going to back down," he told reporters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/bannon-pleads-not-guilty-to-capitol-riot-probe-charges/articleshow/87767806.cms||---
---||India||Supreme Court relief for three booked under UAPA by Tripura||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday gave protection from arrest to a CPI(ML) member, a human rights activist and a journalist, who challenged slapping of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act charges against them for posting "Tripura is burning" and sought a restrictive meaning to "unlawful activities" under the act to curb its rampant misuse. Tripura Police had earlier said that action had been taken against various social media handles for falsely claiming that mosques have been burned down in the state when this was not the case. A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant issued notices to the Centre and the Tripura government on the joint petition filed by the three after hearing advocate Prashant Bhushan briefly. The bench said two others accused under UAPA have already been granted bail and ordered that "in the meantime, no coercive steps, including arrest, shall be taken against the petitioners". First petitioner Mukesh Kumar is an advocate registered with the Bar Council of Delhi and has been associated with the All-India Central Council of Trade Unions, Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) and People's Union for Civil Liberties. The second petitioner is Ansarul Haq Ansari, who said he is a human rights activist from Rajasthan, and the third petitioner is Shyam Meera Singh, a journalist with web portal Newclick who often highlights grievances of the marginalised and minority communities. The petitioners said their grievance is against "the targeted political violence against the Muslim minorities in Tripura during the second half of October 2021, and the subsequent efforts by the state to monopolise the flow of information and facts emanating from the affected areas by invoking provisions of the UAPA against members of civil society, including advocates and journalists who have made the effort to bring facts in relation to the targeted violence in the public domain". The UAPA was enacted in 1967 to counter the threat of left-wing extremism to India and its sovereignty. "If the state is allowed to criminalise the very act of fact-finding and reporting, and that too under the stringent provisions of the UAPA in which anticipatory bail is barred and the idea of bail is a remote possibility, the only facts that will come in the public domain are those that are convenient to the state due to the ‘chilling effect’ on the freedom of speech and expression of members of civil society. If the quest for truth and reporting thereof itself is criminalised then the victim in the process is the idea of justice," they said. The violence had erupted in the state after Durga Puja pandals were allegedly targeted in Bangladesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-relief-for-three-booked-under-uapa-by-tripura/articleshow/87767767.cms||---

Currently, over 80% of the adult population has received at least the first dose of the vaccine, whereas over 40% has got both doses.  The door-to-door vaccination campaign aims to ensure that the entire adult population of the country is covered with the first dose of Covid vaccine, while those who are due for the second dose are motivated to take it as per protocol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-eyes-first-dose-for-all-adults-by-first-week-of-december/articleshow/87767891.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram gurdwara association offers space for namaz||GURUGRAM: A local association of gurdwaras on Wednesday announced it would open its doors to allow namaz with the number of sites for Friday prayers having shrunk by almost half in the city because of protests by right-wing outfits and some local residents over the past few weeks. Gurdwara Singh Sabha Committee of Gurugram, which has five gurdwaras affiliated to it — at Sadar Bazar sabzi mandi, Sector 39 (near Medanta), Sector 46, Jacobpura and Model Town — said it will approach the administration to seek permission to allow Muslims to offer namaz in small groups without compromising on Covid protocols. “It was disturbing to learn about the opposition to namaz in open areas. The doors of our gurdwaras are always open to everyone. If Muslims are facing problems in finding a place for Friday prayers, they are welcome to offer namaz in gurdwaras,” said Harry Sindhu from the committee. He said that while each gurdwara has the capacity to accommodate thousands of people at a time, they have been allowing only small groups due to Covid norms. Sher Dil Singh, another member of the committee, said a gurdwara is “guru ka darbar” where anyone can come and pray. “If our Muslim brothers are facing issues, we will offer them our premises at gurdwaras and their halls,” Singh said, adding that they will welcome whoever wants to offer prayers, irrespective of their faith and beliefs. Last Friday, the number of open sites where namaz is offered in the city came down from 37 to 20, which effectively reduced to 19 after protests at Sirhaul against use of public places for prayers. Welcoming the initiative of the gurdwara association, Khurshid Rajaka, chairman of Muslim Rashtriya Manch, said it will help establish peace and harmony. “Everyone should take inspiration from the Sikh community and help people from other faiths conduct their religious activities without any animosity,” Rajaka said, adding that there have been instances in the past too where Muslims have offered namaz at religious places of other communities. Altaf Ahmad, co-founder of Gurugram Muslim Council and Gurugram Nagrik Ekta Manch, said he and other Muslims in the city appreciated the “gracious offer” from Gurdwara Singh Sabha Committee. “This is a true example of brotherhood where people from multiple faiths have come forward to defeat divisive forces who have been spreading hatred and communal disharmony in the city over the past two 2 months,” said Ahmad. A day earlier, a Hindu man had offered a small commercial space to the Muslim community for namaz. “I am confident that more and more people across communities will come forward to offer their private properties where Muslims can pray every Friday for 30 minutes,” said Ahmad, adding that he hoped the Haryana government will take cognisance and allocate land to Muslims at the earliest for mosques so they can “pray with dignity”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gurgaon-gurdwara-association-offers-space-for-namaz/articleshow/87767979.cms||Bagish Jha
---||World||US says Iran government behind ransomware attacks||WASHINGTON: Iran's government is backing a hacker group responsible for recent ransomware attacks on targets in the United States and Australia, the US cybersecurity agency said Wednesday.  "The Iranian government-sponsored APT actors are actively targeting a broad range of victims across multiple US critical infrastructure sectors, including the Transportation Sector and the Healthcare and Public Health Sector," the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said in an alert.  It said that experts in the FBI, the Australian Cyber Security Centre, and Britain's National Cyber Security Centre had jointly reached the conclusion on Tehran's support for the "APT" group, or "advanced persistent threat," a designation often given to state-backed hackers.  Since at least March 2021, the group has exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet software to hack into systems, including those of a city government and a children's hospital, CISA said.  "These Iranian government-sponsored APT actors can leverage this access for follow-on operations, such as data exfiltration or encryption, ransomware, and extortion," it said.  CISA did not identify any specific targets for the group in the United States or Australia, or say how succesful they have been.  The US Department of Homeland Security estimates that ransomware attackers extorted at leat $350 million from victims last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-says-iran-government-behind-ransomware-attacks/articleshow/87768054.cms||---
---||World||Canada sends military to flood-ravaged Pacific coast||OTTAWA: Canada is sending the military to help evacuate and support communities hit by "extreme flooding" after record rainfall on the Pacific coast, the government said Wednesday.  Downpours in British Columbia this week trapped motorists in mudslides that left at least one dead and two missing, forced thousands to flee their homes, and cut off Vancouver and its port.  "In response to extreme flooding across Southern BC, we have approved the deployment of @CanadianForces air support personnel to assist with evacuation efforts, support supply chain routes, and protect residents against floods and landslides," Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said on Twitter.  A spokesperson told AFP the military was still sorting out the details of the deployment.  In Washington, ahead of a meeting with his US and Mexican counterparts, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the rains caused "historical and terrible flooding that has disrupted the lives and taken lives of people across B.C."  He pledged federal support, saying: "We'll be there for the cleanup and the rebuilding after the impacts of these extreme weather events." Airlifted to safety The torrential rains had let up by Tuesday afternoon. An estimated 300 motorists trapped on highways by mudslides have been airlifted to safety and a few of a dozen evacuation orders have been rescinded.  Meanwhile, searches continue for more possible victims, after police announced late Tuesday the recovery of a woman's body from a mudslide near Lillooet, 250 km (155 miles) north of Vancouver.  Television images showed several towns east of the Vancouver covered in mud and partially inundated, with residents now scrambling for food, heat and water -- as the first snow flurries of the season started to fall.  On the outskirts of Vancouver, a large fire broke out at an RV dealership in the flooded Sumas Prairie, and farmers scrambled to pull livestock from the water.  Abbotsford Mayor Henry Braun and emergency officials told a news conference almost 200 people had been airlifted overnight to safety, after the city of 162,000 warned a pump station was at risk of being overwhelmed due to the Nooksack River carrying a surge of water north from the United States.  Most of the area is farmland created by draining Sumas Lake in the 1920s.  The pump station, Braun said, "was never intended or designed to take on water from another country."  Some highways, meanwhile, remain closed. As a result, motorists wanting to travel to or from Vancouver have to travel south to the United States and back up into Canada.  Landslides also cut off rail traffic to and from Vancouver -- one of Canada's busiest freight sea ports.  Across the province, people are reportedly finding grocery store shelves empty.  Environment Canada said up to 250 millimetres (almost 10 inches) of rain -- what the region normally gets in a month -- fell Sunday and Monday in and around Vancouver, which was also hit last week by a rare tornado.  The extreme weather comes after British Columbia suffered record-high temperatures over the summer that killed more than 500 people, as well as wildfires that destroyed a town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/canada-sends-military-to-flood-ravaged-pacific-coast/articleshow/87768068.cms||---

Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance will hold a press conference on Thursday to announce the exoneration of Muhammad A Aziz and Khalil Islam, his office said Wednesday.  Aziz, 83, was sentenced to life in prison in 1966 but was released in 1985. Also sentenced to life, Islam was released in 1987 and died in 2009.  "These men did not get the justice that they deserved," Vance said in an interview with The New York Times. "What we can do is acknowledge the error, the severity of the error."  The newspaper said that a 22-month investigation conducted jointly by the Manhattan district attorney's office and lawyers for the two men found that prosecutors, the FBI and the New York Police Department withheld evidence that would likely have led to the acquittal of the two men.  A third man, Mujahid Abdul Halim, 80, confessed to Malcolm X's murder and was released from prison in 2010. Halim claimed during their 1966 trial that Aziz and Islam were innocent.  All three were members of the Black nationalist group Nation of Islam, which Malcolm X had recently renounced.  Malcolm X was shot dead by three gunmen on February 21, 1965 as he prepared to deliver a speech in a Manhattan ballroom.  Halim was taken into custody at the scene with a bullet wound to the leg.  Aziz and Islam were arrested several days later. Both denied involvement in the assassination and provided alibis for where they were at the time of the shooting. Innocence Project According to the Manhattan district attorney's office, Thursday's press conference will also be attended by civil rights attorney David Shanies and Barry Scheck, co-director of the Innocence Project.  Shanies and the Innocence Project, a nonprofit which has secured the exoneration of hundreds of wrongfully convicted prisoners in the United States, collaborated with Vance's office in re-investigating the case.  The review of the case followed the release of a Netflix docuseries "Who Killed Malcolm X?"  The Times said the re-investigation did not identify "who prosecutors now believe really killed Malcolm X, and those who were previously implicated but never arrested are dead."  "Nor did it uncover a police or government conspiracy to murder him," the newspaper said. "It also left unanswered questions about how and why the police and the federal government failed to prevent the assassination."  Considered one of the most influential African Americans of the 20th century along with Martin Luther King Jr, Malcolm X was an outspoken advocate of Black rights.  Born Malcolm Little in 1925, he fell into petty crime as a young man and became a devout follower of Islam while in prison.  Upon his release, he changed his surname to "X" as a symbol of the original name of his family lost under slavery.  He rose to prominence as a minister and spokesman for the Nation of Islam, advocating Black self-dependence and esteem. He also did not shy away from the use of violence for self-protection.  Disillusioned with the Nation of Islam, Malcolm X broke away from the group in 1964 and formed the short-lived Organization of Afro-American Unity to continue the promotion of Black rights.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/two-men-found-guilty-of-malcolm-x-murder-to-be-exonerated/articleshow/87768074.cms||---

In her petition, Moitra argued that the central ordinances were contrary to the SC’s own judgments on this issue. Moitra tweeted: “My petition just filed in Supreme Court challenging Union Ordinances on extension to CBI & ED Director tenures being contrary to SC own judgments.” TMC has already moved on Monday statutory resolutions in the Rajya Sabha objecting to the ordinances and said it will raise the issue in Lok Sabha. Sources said Moitra argued that the SC had held that ED director’s tenure cannot be extended beyond his retirement except in “rare and exceptional cases” and only for a “short period”. She said the “one year at a time” extensions cannot be construed as “short”, given the total tenure of ED and CBI directors were for two years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tmcs-mahua-moitra-moves-sc-says-ordinances-on-ed-cbi-chiefs-tenure-against-courts-rulings/articleshow/87768086.cms||Saibal Sen
---||Guwahati||'There has to be a dialogue on the core issue': Assam CM on Ulfa talks||ClarificationA news report published in the Delhi edition of TOI on November 18 under the headline, "Himanta 1st Assam CM ready to discuss Ulfa(I)'s core demand of 'sovereignty'", has been denied in a tweet from the chief minister's official handle.The source of the report was a video clip of CM Sarma speaking in Assamese to TV news channels. Responding to Ulfa(I) extending its unilateral ceasefire by another three months, Sarma said, "I welcome this step by Ulfa ... I would say this is a positive sign. I think somewhere down the line, there has to be a dialogue on the core issue (raised by the outfit). Sometime or the other, there has to be mutual understanding in terms of constitutional boundaries and Ulfa's demand. (These) efforts will continue, but I think this is a long process."As can be seen, the CM did say that at some stage, a dialogue is required on Ulfa’s core issue. The outfit has repeatedly demanded sovereignty. However, the CM did not specifically say that he was himself willing to discuss the issue of sovereignty. TOI’s headline may have conveyed a misleading impression, for which we apologise.Here is the updated news report.GUWAHATI: In a first by any Assam CM, Himanta Biswa Sarma on Wednesday said Ulfa-I's core demand would have to be discussed somewhere in the peace process. It is for the first time since the birth of Ulfa in 1979 that a chief minister of the state has dared to discuss Ulfa’s core demand with positivity. Sarma’s predecessors had either opted for a military option or had shied away from addressing this issue. However, former PM Manmohan Singh in 2005 had announced that the Centre was ready to discuss all “core issues” of Ulfa. The peace process, however, did not take off. Sarma said one needs a “fresh approach” (to the Ulfa issue) and “an equilibrium has to be created between the perimeters of the Constitution and the outfit’s demand” for sovereignty. “I think their core issue will have to be discussed at some point of time,” he added. While to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India is one of the Fundamental Duties enshrined in the Constitution, Ulfa (I) is ready to have the peace dialogue only if its core demand is discussed. Sarma said Ulfa was born over four decades back “for a specific reason” but the situation in the state has completely transformed over the years. “During this long period, the situation of Assam has changed so much…the problems that existed in 1984-85 have now changed their characters completely. Assam’s demography, economy and social aspects are completely different for then and now. I think we have to respect the emotions of the people and realign with the situation of present day and for that if we can change our mindset and thought process, we can move forward with a new outlook.” Sarma also welcomed Ulfa’s (I) extension of unilateral ceasefire by another three months and termed it as a positive gesture. He had earlier said Ulfa (I) chief Paresh Baruah has been saying in the media that discussions must be held on sovereignty but on the other hand whether it is the PM or the CM or any minister, he or she has taken the solemn oath to protect India’s sovereignty and “under this situation, both sides are on opposite poles.” He had then suggested finding a middle path.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/there-has-to-be-a-dialogue-on-the-core-issue-assam-cm-on-ulfa-talks/articleshow/87768135.cms||Prabin Kalita

His campaign said the money came from more than 20,000 donations in the first 24 hours but did not immediately provide further details, including the number of large contributions or how many came from Texas residents.  But although the numbers showed an early burst of enthusiasm for O'Rourke, the former El Paso congressman still has a long way to catch or even approach Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who this summer reported having at least $55 million in campaign funds. Abbott, who is seeking a third term, is the most prolific fundraiser of any governor in the US and routinely collects six-figure donations in big money from Texas executives.  O'Rourke raised $80 million in his 2018 Senate campaign - at the time a record for that office - but his donors will not be confined this time by federal campaign finance laws, since Texas has no limits on individual contributions.  O'Rourke launched his campaign Monday and is spending the first days of the race campaigning along the Texas-Mexico border, where Democrats are on the defensive after unexpected GOP gains there in 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/orourke-raises-2m-in-first-day-of-texas-governor-campaign/articleshow/87768148.cms||---

The FBI, the Colorado Attorney General's office and local authorities conducted the searches, which were authorised by a federal court, on Tuesday in Mesa and neighboring Garfield counties, Mesa County district attorney Dan Rubinstein told Colorado Politics.  Rubinstein didn't disclose the locations that were searched, telling The Associated Press in an email that "all documents related to these operations are sealed" by court order.  But Tina Peters, the elections clerk for Mesa County, which includes the city of Grand Junction, said her home was searched, the Colorado Politics media outlet reported.  "The FBI raided my home at 6 a.m. this morning, accusing me of committing a crime," Peters said. "And they raided the homes of my friends, mostly older women. I was terrified."  The FBI office in Denver didn't immediately respond to an email requesting comment. Lawrence Pacheco, spokesman for Attorney General Phil Weiser, said the state is working with Mesa County on an investigation into the alleged election system breach but could not comment further on the continuing probe.  The searches came amid an ongoing dispute between Peters, who presided over elections in conservative Mesa County in 2020, and Griswold, a Democrat and vocal presence nationally for ensuring election integrity.  Peters has become an advocate for those who believe, without evidence, that the 2020 election was fraudulent - although she has said elections in Mesa County, which voted overwhelmingly for Trump, were secure and accurate. In contrast, Democrat Joe Biden handily defeated Trump in 2020, and Democrats control the governor's office, the state Legislature and all statewide offices.  Colorado Politics reported that Peters commented about the searches during an appearance on an online channel operated by Mike Lindell, the MyPillow CEO and a supporter of Peters and former President Donald Trump who has repeatedly made discredited claims that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.  Peters, a Republican, is being investigated by the FBI and by Colorado state officials state in an alleged breach of elections equipment in Mesa County in May. Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat, successfully sued to have Peters and a deputy, Belinda Knisley, prohibited by a judge from administering the November mid-term election. Peters has denied any wrongdoing.  Knisley was subsequently suspended and charged with felony second-degree burglary and a cybercrime misdemeanor count by Rubinstein's office. Knisley also has denied wrongdoing.  The Grand Junction Sentinel reported that an arrest warrant affidavit alleges Knisley entered a "building or structure with intent to commit a crime against another person or property."  Griswold sued to remove Peters as county clerk and recorder after Griswold said images of election equipment management software from Mesa County were obtained by elections conspiracy theorists and posted on far-right blogs.  Griswold's office has said one of the images was taken May 23 from inside a secure room in Mesa County where the voting equipment was stored and had been accessed that day by Peters, who allowed a non-employee into the room.  After Griswold filed the lawsuit, Peters was absent from Colorado for several weeks, only appearing publicly in broadcasts hosted by Lindell. Peters claimed that Griswold's investigation is an attempt to take over one of the few remaining conservative counties in Colorado.  Griswold's office has identified the person it says was allowed into the secure room but has refused to say anything more about who he is or why he was there. The Associated Press isn't naming him until more information becomes available. He has not been charged with a crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/cops-search-4-colorado-locations-in-election-security-probe/articleshow/87768203.cms||---

Skies were sunny Wednesday morning in the area around Sumas, Washington, where about 500 rescues and evacuations were reported.  "We're looking at going door-to-door, as waters go down in different parts of town," Sumas Mayor Kevin Christensen told The Seattle Times. "Half is on dry ground, half has water."  The soaking by a so-called atmospheric river that dumped torrents rain on the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia from Saturday through Monday reminded people of western Washington's record, severe flooding in November 1990 when two people died and there were more than 2,000 evacuations.  While the weather was improving, the situation remained dire in British Columbia, where the Canadian government was sending in the military to help out with floods and mudslides that destroyed parts of several major highways.  Immediately across the border from Sumas, residents of a low-lying area of Abbotsford, British Columbia, have been warned they face a significant risk to life and must evacuate to avoid rising water levels.  Mayor Henry Braun said Wednesday that conditions were bad overnight because a key pumping station was in danger of being overwhelmed. He said crews spent Tuesday night sandbagging around the station and things were "holding steady."  "I'm feeling much better today than last night," Braun said, although he cautioned the danger had not passed.  Fast-rising water levels on the Sumas River in Washington state on Tuesday overwhelmed rescuers in Abbotsford, where 1,100 homes were evacuated. Those residents joined thousands of others in the province who were forced from their homes by floods or landslides starting Sunday night.  Braun said Tuesday that impassable highways were creating havoc as authorities tried to get people to evacuation sites.  On Facebook, the City of Sumas said Wednesday that water levels were continuing to drop and it looked like the community wouldn't be affected by the situation in Abbotsford. It said crews were working hard to clear roads and return power to parts of town still without.  "These families and businesses need our prayers and support as we start the process of cleanup and rebuilding over the next few days," the city said in another Facebook post.  Across the border, the body of a woman was recovered from a landslide near the small community of Lillooet, British Columbia,. Royal Canadian Mounted Police said at least two other people were reported missing.  Southwest of Sumas, Washington, a 59-year-old man from Everson identified by police Tuesday as Jose Garcia remained missing after his truck was swept into a flooded field and he had been clinging to a tree.  In the city Ferndale, also southwest of Sumas, officials on Tuesday urged people in homes and businesses to evacuate in an area near the rising Nooksack River. Bystanders near the town's main street rescued a man Tuesday who mistakenly drove into floodwaters. The half-dozen people waded into waters up to their chests and pushed the floating car to drier ground.  The rains were caused by an atmospheric river - a huge plume of moisture extending over the Pacific and into Washington, Oregon and British Columbia.  About 5.57 inches (14.14 centimeters) of rain fell at Bellingham International Airport from Saturday through Monday, Nov. 15. The normal monthly rain total is 5.2 inches (13.2 centimeters) for November, according to National Weather Service data.  Washington Gov. Jay Inslee on Monday declared a severe weather state of emergency in 14 counties.  It was the second major widespread flood event in the northwest part of Washington state in less than two years, and climate change is fueling more powerful and frequent severe weather, Whatcom County officials told the Bellingham Herald.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-canada-border-towns-assess-damage-from-devastating-floods/articleshow/87768225.cms||---
---||World||Rittenhouse lawyers ask judge to declare mistrial over video||KENOSHA: Kyle Rittenhouse's attorneys asked the judge on Wednesday to declare a mistrial before the jury reaches a decision, saying the defence received an inferior copy of a key video from prosecutors.  Defense attorney Corey Chirafisi told Judge Bruce Schroeder that the defence would have approached things differently if it had received the higher quality video earlier.  He says the request would be made "without prejudice," meaning prosecutors could try Rittenhouse again if the judge were to grant the request.  Prosecutors countered that the jury saw the highest-quality version of the video during the trial and it was played without objection.  Schroeder did not immediately rule on the mistrial request.  THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.  KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) - The jury at Kyle Rittenhouse's murder trial will be allowed to review some of the video in the Kenosha shootings, after their request on the second day of deliberations Wednesday triggered debate between the judge and opposing attorneys over how to accommodate the request.  The judge, meanwhile, expressed irritation over the media's coverage and legal experts' commentary on some of his decisions, saying he would "think long and hard" about allowing televised trials in the future.  Jurors were weighing charges against Rittenhouse for a second day after they failed to reach a swift verdict Tuesday on whether he was the instigator of a night of bloodshed in Kenosha or a concerned citizen who came under attack while trying to protect property.  About two hours into deliberations Wednesday, jurors asked to view video shown earlier in the trial and Judge Bruce Schroeder said he would determine the procedures to allow that.  After getting the jury's request, the judge and the attorneys confronted a host of questions and, in some cases, sources of disagreement. Among them: Should the jurors watch the video in the courtroom or in the jury room? Who else can be present if it's done in the courtroom? And how many times should they be allowed to rewind and watch a piece of footage?  Prosecutor Thomas Binger said they should be able to view any video they wanted as many times as they wanted, and the judge seemed to agree.  "Sometimes there is one piece of evidence that is absolutely critical. ... To me, if they want to watch it 100 times, that's them," Schroeder said.  But defense attorneys said they would object to the jury viewing video taken by a drone that prosecutors said showed Rittenhouse pointing his gun at protesters before the shootings. The image prompted heated dispute earlier in the trial over technical questions about whether enlarging images notably changes them.  Both sides agreed with loading the videos that jurors wanted to see onto a computer for them to view in the jury room. The judge - who said he was "queasy" about allowing the drone video - said jurors hadn't asked to rewatch that video, only to have it ready to watch.  Earlier Wednesday, Schroeder took exception to news stories about his decisions to not allow the men Rittenhouse shot to be called victims and to allow Rittenhouse to play a minor role in determining which jurors were alternates, and the fact that he had not yet ruled on a defense motion for a mistrial.  Schroeder said he hasn't read the motion because he just received it on Tuesday.  "It's just a shame that irresponsible statements are being made," Schroeder said of comments in a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story from law school professors about him not ruling on the mistrial motion.  The case went to the anonymous jury after Schroeder allowed Rittenhouse to reach into a raffle drum and draw numbered slips that determined which of the 18 jurors who sat through the case would deliberate and which ones would be dismissed as alternates.  That task is usually performed by a court clerk, not the defendant. Schroeder has said he has been having defendants do it for at least 20 years.  "I would admit that there are not a large number of courts that do that, maybe not any," Schroeder said Wednesday.  The jury of 12 deliberated for a full day Tuesday without reaching a decision.  Rittenhouse, 18, faces life in prison if convicted on the most serious charge for using an AR-style semi-automatic rifle to kill two men and wound a third during a night of protests against racial injustice in Kenosha in the summer of 2020. The former police youth cadet is white, as were those he shot.  Rittenhouse testified that he acted in self-defense, while prosecutors argued that he provoked the violence. The case has become a flashpoint in the U.S. debate over guns, racial-justice protests, vigilantism, and law and order.  The jury appeared to be overwhelmingly white. Prospective jurors were not asked to identify their race during the selection process, and the court did not provide a racial breakdown.  Though protests have been generally muted around the courthouse during the trial, on Wednesday a man arrived carrying a long rifle and wearing what appeared to be body armor. After being approached by police, he left and returned a short time later without the gun. The man had spent Tuesday shouting anti-Black Lives Matter statements through a megaphone and was involved in a confrontation that day with another protester.  Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, who faced criticism over his response to the Kenosha protests in 2020, urged calm as the jury deliberated. He announced last week that 500 members of the National Guard would stand ready for duty in Kenosha if needed.  Rittenhouse was 17 when he went to Kenosha from his home in Antioch, Illinois, in what he said was an effort to protect property from rioters in the days after a Black man, Jacob Blake, was shot by a white Kenosha police officer.  In a fast-moving series of clashes in the streets, Rittenhouse shot and killed Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and wounded Gaige Grosskreutz, now 28.  During closing arguments Monday, prosecutor Thomas Binger said that Rittenhouse was a "wannabe soldier" who set the deadly chain of events in motion by bringing a rifle to a protest and pointing it at protesters just before he was chased.  But Rittenhouse lawyer Mark Richards countered that Rittenhouse was ambushed by a "crazy person" - Rosenbaum.  Rittenhouse testified that Rosenbaum chased him down and made a grab for his rifle, causing him to fear the weapon was going to be used against him. His account of Rosenbaum's behavior was largely corroborated by video and some of the prosecution's own witnesses.  As for Huber, he was gunned down after he was seen on video hitting Rittenhouse with a skateboard. And Grosskreutz admitted he had his own gun pointed at Rittenhouse when he was shot.  In his instructions to the jury, Schroeder said that to accept Rittenhouse's claim of self-defense, the jurors must find that he believed there was an unlawful threat to him and that the amount of force he used was reasonable and necessary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/rittenhouse-lawyers-ask-judge-to-declare-mistrial-over-video/articleshow/87768281.cms||---

Information and Broadcasting Minister Anurag Thakur said these uncovered villages of 44 aspirational districts across five states of Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Odisha will get 4G-based mobile services. "So, a total 7,287 uncovered villages will get telecom towers and services, and lakhs of people will get connectivity," Thakur said. The estimated cost of implementation of Rs 6,466 crore includes operational expenses for five years. The project would be funded by the USOF, and would be completed within 18 months of signing of the agreement, a statement said. The work related to provision of 4G mobile services in identified uncovered villages would be awarded through an open competitive bidding process as per extant USOF procedures. “The present proposal for provisioning of mobile services in the remote and difficult uncovered areas of aspirational districts across five states of Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Odisha will enhance digital connectivity useful for self-reliance, facilitate learning, dissemination of information and knowledge, skill upgradation and development, disaster management, e-Governance initiatives...,” the release said. The move would also enable establishment of enterprises and e-commerce facilities, provision of adequate support to educational institutes for knowledge sharing and availability of job opportunity, while fulfilling the vision of Digital India. USO Fund is meant to help provide telecom access in the remotest parts of the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mobile-links-in-7-3k-uncovered-villages-get-cabinet-nod/articleshow/87768367.cms||---
---||India||Coal ‘phase down’ taken from US-China COP26 statement, criticism of India unfair, say officials||NEW DELHI: Seeking to counter criticism from developed countries about India being the last-minute spoiler at the recent COP26 with regard to coal, senior officials pushed back saying such commentary is ill-informed and unfair. The term “phase down” which replaced “phase out” of coal emissions was taken from the US-China statement of the day before. Officials said India objected to the fact that only coal was mentioned and not oil and gas, which is primarily used by the developed countries. That puts countries like India and China in the dock while providing a loophole for western countries. Officials also said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remarks on net-zero and other climate pledges should not be confused with India’s NDCs — the PM was setting out “national goals” while the revised NDC is a technical document. The PM, sources said, made an “ambitious statement.” “It took many by surprise. PM said if you want higher ambition in mitigation, there should be more ambition in financing and adaptation. Ambition cannot be one-sided.” Brandon Wu, policy head of ActionAid US summarised the core "injustice" in a Twitter thread, where he described western actions as “climate colonialism.” “The text targets "unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies" which leaves GIANT loopholes for CCS (and "efficient" FF subsidies) as well as leaving out oil & gas entirely. India earlier suggested that it address ALL fossil fuels in an equitable manner. But an equitable fossil fuel phaseout would place most of the burden squarely on the US and rich countries… Instead, the #COP26 existing language has heavy implications for developing countries like India and tons of loopholes for the continuation of US fossil fuel activities.” India and China worked together on the coal language officials said, but unfortunately, India was in the spotlight as its environment minister was asked to read out the final outcome. Critics have pointed to India’s “naïveté” through which China was let off the hook while India took the brickbats, despite showing the biggest commitment to climate mitigation goals at the summit. “We objected to the over-emphasis on mitigation versus finance and adaptation”, sources said, adding India had consistently objected to the targeting of coal subsidies. There is, however, another view that if India had not asserted itself, the government would well have faced criticism for not being vigilant about the country's interests. The view in government is that the goals set out by the PM for 2030 are a strong goad for western nations to fulfill their side of the deal. The BASIC statement, officials said, made it clear India would not agree to phase out of coal subsidies — India was joined by South Africa, Australia, Indonesia, Venezuelan, Nigeria, China among others. A compromise was worked out bringing the language close to the G-20 statement, they added, “with national safeguards and adequate protection for poor and vulnerable countries.” Ultimately, “we tried to find consensus.” The final document brought back “phase-out” of coal subsidies on the request of small island countries, and kept “phase down” for coal. Sources said India has been consistently pushing for enhanced commitment in financing. “Neither finance nor technology transfers have been adequate by any means.” Officials also added that India was aiming to be a voice for other developing countries. “That’s our ethos,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/coal-phase-down-taken-from-us-china-cop26-statement-criticism-of-india-unfair-say-officials/articleshow/87768457.cms||Indrani Bagchi

The exit of Narendra Bhati, CP Chand, Ravi Shankar Singh and Rama Niranjan came amid speculation about a coup by BJP to put SP on the back foot even before the battle begins. The term of all four MLCs in the upper house runs till March 7. “Akhilesh won’t be able to sleep tonight,” said UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh after inducting the four MLCs into the party at its state headquarters here. He urged all four to ensure their supporters joined BJP en masse at the booth and sector levels. Bhati had grabbed eyeballs for going against IAS officer Durga Sakhti Nagpal when the latter launched a crackdown on the sand mining mafia during SP’s last stint in government. He represents the politically influential Gurjar community in west UP. CP Chand is a Dalit from CM Yogi Adityanath’s backyard Gorakhpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-boost-to-bjp-before-up-polls-4-sp-mlcs-join-saffron-party/articleshow/87768581.cms||Pankaj Shah

"Bengaluru is the world's fastest-growing technology hub – of course, we want to be part of it. It is home to a third of India's unicorn companies. Australia's new mission in Bengaluru would expand our diplomatic presence in India to five posts," he said at the inaugural session of the Bengaluru Tech Summit. Australian foreign affairs minister Marise Payne said in a release that the new consulate-general will focus on "deepening Australia's ties to India's vibrant innovators, technologists and entrepreneurs". ‘This is about four like-minded democracies coming together’Australian foreign affairs minister Marise Payne said it will support Australian businesses in one of the world’s most important commercial centres. "Half of the next billion internet users are projected to be in India, and India’s digital economy, centred on Bengaluru, is set to grow to US$1 trillion by 2025,” Marise Payne said. Morrison referred to India and Australia’s friendship and said the countries are also working with the United States and Japan through the Quad Leaders Dialogue. ‘A positive partnership’"This is about four like-minded democracies coming together, from our region, to show we can make a positive difference in addressing our region's biggest challenges. It's a very practical and positive partnership – fostering an open, accessible, and secure technology ecosystem – that's a big focus of ours," he said. He announced the setting up in India of a new Australia-India Centre of Excellence for Critical and Emerging Technology Policy. He said it will bring together Australian and Indian technologists, policy practitioners, academics, researchers and thought leaders. He said it will help the two countries shape technology governance so it "aligns with our values and supports an open, inclusive and resilient Indo-Pacific region".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bluru-top-it-hub-well-set-up-consulate-oz-pm/articleshow/87768640.cms||---
---||World||US drug overdoses top 100,000 in pandemic year||WASHINGTON: US annual drug overdose deaths surged to more than 100,000 for the first time during the Covid-19 pandemic, a crisis driven mainly by fentanyl and exacerbated by a flood of fake online pills, officials said Wednesday.  Experts say people with substance use disorders have been hit hard by daily life disruptions, while authorities are seizing record numbers of counterfeit and sometimes deadly medicines from Mexico.  "As we continue to make strides to defeat the Covid-19 pandemic, we cannot overlook this epidemic of loss, which has touched families and communities across the country," President Joe Biden said in a statement.  Between April 2020 and April 2021, the country saw 100,306 fatal overdoses, an increase of 28.5 percent compared to the same period the previous year -- equal to one death every five minutes.  Overall, opioids accounted for 75,673 of the 100,306 fatalities, with the vast majority from synthetic opioids, primarily fentanyl.  "It's time to face the fact that this crisis seems to be getting worse. We need all hands on deck," health secretary Xavier Becerra said in a call with reporters.  "We see it in the faces of grieving families and all those overworked caregivers. You hear it every time you get that panic 911 phone call.  "You read it in obituaries of sons and daughters, who left us way too soon... and since Covid-19 hit, it's gotten worse."  Deaths from psychostimulants like methamphetamine, as well as from natural and semi-synthetic opioids, such as prescription pain medication, and cocaine were also up.  Covid-19 killed around 508,000 people in the same time frame, according to Our World in Data.  "Many of the challenges left behind by the pandemic will actually make people more vulnerable to mental illness and substance use disorders," Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse said in the briefing.  At the same time, the US Drug Enforcement Administration has warned Americans about prescription pills available online that are made to look like real Oxycontin, Vicodin, Xanax or Adderall, but contain lethal doses of fentanyl and methamphetamine.  The DEA has seized more than 14 million pills this year, with the vast majority produced in Mexico from chemicals supplied by China.  The fake pills are widely available on social media and e-commerce platforms.  In 2019, the latest year for which national data was available, heart disease was the leading cause of death, with some 660,000 fatalities, followed by cancer, with around 600,000 deaths, and unintentional injuries, at 175,000.  - Life-saving nasal spray - Biden's administration meanwhile announced the release of a "model law" it wants states to adopt that would widen access to naloxone, a life-saving nasal spray that reverses overdoses.  "I believe that no one should die of an overdose simply because they didn't have access to naloxone," said Rahul Gupta, director of national drug control policy.  "Sadly, today that is happening across the country."  The act includes provisions that would grant immunity to individuals who administer naloxone, require physicians to co-prescribe it when prescribing opioids, ensure health insurance covers the medicine, and seek to educate more people about the benefits.  Tom Wolf, the governor of Pennsylvania, said Wednesday his administration wanted ordinary citizens to carry the medicine, which is available to the public throughout the state's pharmacies.  In his statement, Biden touted a stimulus package that passed in March and delivered $4 billion to expand services for substance abuse and mental health.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-drug-overdoses-top-100000-in-pandemic-year/articleshow/87768662.cms||---

According to the report, 10.7% of the children enrolled in schools were taking private tuitions in 2018. The figure dipped to 8.4% in 2020, possibly due to the lockdown. However, ASER 2021 shows that the number is at 20.5% now, a growth of around 10 percentage points. ASER 2021 was conducted in September-October 2021 when schools were starting to reopen and among 1.9 lakh households and 11,545 schools through phone calls. Nationally, the report noted that tuition classes were more common among children whose schools were still closed at the time of the survey. Across India, children taking tuitions in classes 1-5 has increased from 24% to 37%. In classes 3-5, it is 39% and classes 6-8, it is 39% and others is at 41%. Around 40% of government school children and 38% of private school children take tuitions.  In South India, the prevalence of tuitions was mostly in Kerala at 28%, which dropped to 19%. Tuition creates unnecessary competition, says expertTamil Nadu was 14% (now 17%), Maharashtra 14% (now 20%), Telangana 6% (now 10%) and Andhra Pradesh 15% (now 23%). Except in Kerala, tuitions have grown across all states, which the report said is a natural response to prolonged school closure. "It is curious that while economic disruptions may have moved children out of private schools, parents were still able to access tuitions where they had to pay fees. This may be due to the fact that tuition classes are a local phenomenon where payment may adjust flexibly and quickly based on demand and supply negotiated between the tutor and the family... The decisions to open or shut government schools are taken by authorities at district or state level with school teachers having no say in when or how school reopening can happen. But for the tuition sector, all decisions are local, flexible and can be immediate; these classes open or shut easily responding instantly to local conditions with different waves of the pandemic," said the report. Across the country, there is a 11-percentage-point growth in children taking tuitions. Among the southern states, Karnataka had the highest growth in this section and stood 11th overall. Educationists in the state echoed the reasons stated by the report. "Left with no choice, parents had to choose tuitions so that children do not lose out on studies. However, tuitions are not a healthy trend. It puts the focus only on exams and defeats the purpose of education as a goal. It creates unnecessary competition, while the important goals of schooling like socialisation are forgotten," said VP Niranjanaradhya, educationist. Trend across statesThe report indicates that in states like Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, tuition-taking was low in the past. In contrast, in the eastern states like West Bengal, Bihar and Odisha, going to tuition was common even in lower grades.

PhonePe had crossed the 1-billion mark in February. The next billion came in just 8 months. The growth comes on the back of rapid traction across tier -2 and -3 cities, and beyond. It has seen over 145 million monthly active users, $600-billion annualised total payments value (TPV), and digital transactions from over 19,000 pincodes, constituting more than 99% of the country. PhonePe founder & CEO Sameer Nigam said, “Last month was phenomenal for PhonePe, as we processed our highest ever transactions till date, cementing our position as India’s leading payments platform. The fact that 80% of our transactions come from tier-2, -3 cities and beyond shows that digital payments have truly penetrated across the length and breadth of the country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/processed-2bn-transactions-in-oct-phonepe/articleshow/87768664.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Venkaiah Naidu says tech must focus on agriculture||Bengaluru: Vice President Venkaiah Naidu said the Bengaluru Tech Summit should focus on technology that can be implemented in agriculture, which continues to be the source of livelihood for millions of Indians.“The sector is facing turbulence,” he said, while speaking at the opening ceremony of the 3-day event. “There are challenges, and a lot of changes are happening because of climate change.” A 1-2 degrees celsius rise in temperature is likely to decrease rice production by about 0.75 tonnes per hectare in inland zones and 0.06 tonnes per hectare in coastal regions. Agriculture in the country is largely dependent on the four-month monsoon season, which has become erratic over the last few years. The increasing variability in precipitation has resulted in prolonged dry spells followed by heavy downpour resulting in flooding.Naidu said the Prime Minister is focused on transforming the entire system using technology. “Our country is going through the digital India programme. We have made remarkable progress in Aadhaar transformation, DBT (direct benefit transfer) and availability of various government services to the people. We must take advantage of tech advancement to accelerate digital transformation that will create real transformation. The PM’s mantra is reform, perform and transform,” he added.The theme for the 24th edition of the summit is `Driving the Next,’ highlighting the role of digital and technological innovations in driving growth of multiple sectors. Representatives from some 30 countries are participating, as are thousands of local tech leaders, technologists, and entrepreneurs, and more than 300 exhibitors.Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said he wants more accountability from the summit in terms of taking technology forward and having an impact on every human life.“Innovation is Saraswati (goddess of learning) and her vahana is hansa, that flies to the highest levels. Even in Kailash Manasarovara, you will have hansas and no eagles, and Benglauru is like hansa, a vehicle of Goddess Saraswati and we have to take it to the heights of Kailash Manasarovara. The best of talent is in Karnataka and I am sitting in a spaceship of the future,” he said.Biocon chief Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said the pandemic has brought the spotlight on technology with irreversible disruptions in the way people work. “Vaccines are being developed in less than a year, technology startups are booming, VC money is flowing in, and India is at the epicentre with its large talent pool of engineers and bioscientists,” she said.Ashwath Narayan, minister for IT & BT, and higher education, said the focus of technology has to be on impacting lives. “We all know about artificial intelligence – but how can farmers benefit from this through improved crop yield predictions? We know about the massive advancements in space and drone technology, but can it help in improved flood management and disaster relief?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/venkaiah-naidu-says-tech-must-focus-on-agriculture/articleshow/87768665.cms||---

The task group will work towards creating a projected roadmap for the growth of the industry, identifying the opportunities and challenges faced by the fintech ecosystem, and leveraging the partnering institutions and government to solve for them.B V Naidu, chairman, KDEM said, “India has emerged as one of the world’s fastest-growing tech innovation hubs in the world, with fintech leading the charge as the industry has raised close to $10 billion in investment. India’s financial inclusion and digitisation success story has been made possible by the combined efforts of the government as well as tech innovations, fundamentally disrupting the way masses access financial services. Taking a cue from this, KDEM launched the first Karnataka Fintech Task group, bringing together industry leaders to further pave the way for future innovations, founders, and citizens to participate in India’s fintech success story.”Reports by FICCI and BCG (Boston Consulting Group) suggest that the Indian fintech sector will attain a valuation of $150-$160 billion by 2025. Karnataka is home to India’s leading fintech companies like Razorpay, Zerodha, Khatabook, and Cred. These companies are tackling issues ranging from digital payments adoption to offering efficient neo-banking solutions, investment avenues, access to easy credit. Apart from Mathur, the task group comprises Timmanna Gouda of Whatsloan, Miten Sampat of Cred and Nithin Kamath of Zerodha, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-sets-up-task-group-for-fintech-growth/articleshow/87768666.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: KSRTC women who adopt to get 180 days’ maternity leave||BENGALURU: The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC), among the very few state-run transport corporations in the country, will provide 180 days leave, on the lines of maternity leave, to women employees who adopt children. However, if she has two surviving children, she cannot avail this benefit. KSRTC managing director Shivayogi C Kalasad on Wednesday issued a notification allowing its employees who adopt children to avail maternity leave on par with biological parents. At present, adoptive parents had to take their own leave. The 180 days’ leave can be availed within the first year of adoption or before the child is one year old, whichever happens first. “We’re following the state government’s order to treat adoptive parents on par with biological parents,” said a KSRTC official. In February 2020, the state government had issued an order permitting women employees to take 180 days of maternity leave and 15 days of paternity leave for fathers. The KSRTC order, however, has no mention of paternity leave for adoptive fathers. Many KSRTC employees welcomed the move. “Being a transport employee is a stressful life. It’s a good move and benefits several women. Paternity leave should also be provided to male employees,” said a woman employee of KSRTC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ksrtc-women-who-adopt-to-get-180-days-maternity-leave/articleshow/87768668.cms||---

The accused, Zuhab Hameed Shakeel Manna alias Zohaib Manna, had been elusive for long. NIA had registered a case against him and three associates in September 2020. The three were arrested earlier. “Accused Manna and aide Mohhammed Tauqir were the key conspirators, who in association with other co-accused, raised funds, radicalized gullible youth and recruited them to join IS,” NIA sleuths said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bizman-held-for-is-links/articleshow/87768669.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Canal froths, raises spectre of another Bellandur lake||BENGALURU: Huge chunks of foam were found floating on Wednesday morning in Belathur canal, off K R Puram, causing concern that the city may see a repeat of what happened in Bellandur lake, which began frothing owing to unbridled pollution a few years ago. Citizens residing near Belathur canal woke up to a shock when they noticed the chunks. Sudhakar Amirapu, a resident of Belathur, said in over 11 years he has never seen the canal foaming. “The residents of our apartment used to be happy to wake up to a clean canal, but the appearance of the foam on Wednesday was disturbing,” Sudhakar told TOI. Belathur canal, according to lake activists of Bengaluru and civic officials, is the remnant of Dakshina Pinakini river that once originated in Nandi Hills and flowed through Chikkaballapur, Bengaluru Rural, Bengaluru Urban and Kolar districts, before entering Tamil Nadu in Hosur. The canal carries water from Yelo Mallappa Shetty lake towards Kadugodi and Channasandra before entering TN. There are over 15 apartments with 500 flats on Belathur’s 3rd Main near where the canal flows. Residents alleged the stream is polluted due to release of industrial effluents into it. Tinu Cherian Abraham, a resident of Surakshaa Fariview Apartment, said it appeared that the infamous ‘snow from Bellandur’ was now descending on Belathur. “All these years, we never complained about the canal, but we are worried it may turn into another Bellandur or Varthur lake,” Cherian said. With the area near Belathur canal not getting Cauvery water supply and residents dependent on borewells, they are worried that the frothing could be a sign of high pollution that may affect the groundwater level. “As many of us depend on groundwater, our health is at stake with industrial effluents being released into the canal,” Cherian added. Priya M, another resident who recently shifted to Belathur, said she is concerned about her children and parents. “This industrial waste can be toxic. If another Bellandur happens, it might catch fire spreading toxicity in the air,” she said. In 2019, a proposal to revive Dakshina Pinakini hit a roadblock, with the government showing little or no interest in raising corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds to rejuvenate the river. ‘Govt doesn’t understand value of waterbodies’A veteran activist said several lake groups and environmentalists were keen on reviving lakes and kalyanis along Dakshina Pinakini. “If the government had made the decision to revive the lakes, there wouldn’t be froth in this canal today. The government does not understand the importance of waterbodies,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/canal-froths-raises-spectre-of-another-bellandur-lake/articleshow/87768670.cms||Nithya Mandyam
---||Bengaluru||‘Anywhere registration’ policy could see revival in Karnataka||BENGALURU: The government is looking at reintroducing the ‘anywhere property registration’ policy, after nearly a two-year hiatus, for the convenience of people. But with legal impediments to the policy (a related petition is pending before the high court), the government is being cautious in its approach towards bringing it back. First introduced in 2013, the policy has been propagated by successive governments as a move to ease property registration pangs of house owners. For instance, in Bengaluru Urban, there are five registrar districts — Shivajinagar, Basavanagudi, Gandhinagar, Jayanagar and Rajajinagar — with 42 sub-registrar offices under them. As per the present policy, any property registration in Bengaluru has to be done under the specific district registrar office. However, if the ‘anywhere registration’ policy is enforced, then a building/house owner can register his/her property anywhere in Bengaluru district. “We are in the process of reintroducing the policy, but need to look into the pros and cons of it. In the presence of an ‘anywhere registration’ facility, citizens needn’t go to the specific sub-registrar office under a specific district registrar jurisdiction for the purpose of registration,” said revenue principal secretary Tushar Giri Nath. Nath said the government is now seeking opinions from across the state and may even expand the policy to the bigger municipal jurisdictions in Karnataka. “While Bengaluru will be our focus, we are also collecting inputs on whether bigger municipal areas like Belagavi, Mysuru, Mangaluru and Hubballi-Dharwad can also be provided with the ‘anywhere registration’ policy,” said Nath, adding that the final decision will be taken by the revenue minister and tabled before the cabinet. There are 242 sub-registrar offices across the state under 34 district registrars. Inspector general of stamps and registration PN Ravindra told TOI t he has already sought the opinion of district registrars on whether the policy will assist the government or be detrimental to revenue collection. “But we cannot proceed without taking the judiciary into confidence. We are planning to prepare detailed reports on the matter, one from the IGR office and another from our legal team, to place before the HC for its approval of the policy,” said Ravindra. The court had in 2019 said that the decision was well-intended, but there were concerns shown by the petitioners that the policy could lead to multiple registrations of the same property and duplication issues. The court had asked the government to look into the matter and submit its response in three months. “Hopefully, by the end of this calendar year, the response will be ready for submission before the HC,” he said, adding that the delay was on account of Covid-19 pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/anywhere-registration-policy-could-see-revival/articleshow/87768672.cms||Sandeep Moudgal
---||Bengaluru||Researchers develop compound for autism treatment||Bengaluru: A group of researchers from Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR) in Bengaluru has developed a compound called 6BIO that can provide a better method to treat Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The team has already determined the potency of the compound in a preclinical mice model. It says this is the first compound that has been proved in preclinical evaluation to have the potential for improving efficiency of daily activities like learning and recollecting new tasks in patients with ASD/intellectual disability (ID).The research — carried out by Vijaya Verma, MJ Vijay Kumar, Kavita Sharma, Sridhar Rajaram, Ravi Muddashetty, Ravi Manjithaya, Thomas Behnisch and James P Clement from JNCASR — has been published in Experimental Brain Research.“Previous studies have attributed disruption in optimal brain development, mainly neuronal connections, during the early stage of development (babies/childhood) as one of the causes of ASD/ID. Due to altered brain development, information processing becomes aberrant and understanding simple tasks becomes exceptionally challenging for patients with ASD/ID,” the researchers said.Pointing out that current therapeutics to treat ASD aim to alleviate symptoms such as epileptic seizures or sleep issues but not to treat the multiple problems of ASD/ID, they said a major challenge in finding better therapeutics is the potency of the drug to help patients perform daily activities with efficiency close to that of a healthy person. Achieving this is particularly difficult after a certain age, especially from the mid-childhood stages, they said, adding that ASD patients still struggle to perform everyday activities without assistance from others as they are unable to learn and recollect new tasks. “Data from the current study indicates that 6BIO — synthesised in JNCASR — can help such children learn and recall, be social, and alleviate other symptoms such as seizures or sleep issues. Thus, 6BIO, can be a better therapeutics option to treat ASD,” they said. Using electrophysiology, which helps understand how neurons communicate, and behaviour experiments, which indicate the overall brain function, the team has shown that 6BIO can restore the information processing in the preclinical mouse model. Therefore, the compound, they said, had a strong potential for therapeutics to treat ASD/ID. ‘Restored neural functions after mid-childhood too’All the behaviour and electrophysiology work was performed in Dr James Clement’s lab at JNCASR, the authors said, adding that another novelty of this study was that 6BIO restored the neural functions not only when administered during development (1-2 years) and childhood stages (3-6 years) but also after mid-childhood (7-11 years) when most of the brain regions are considered to have formed properly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/researchers-develop-compound-for-autism-treatment/articleshow/87768674.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Passengers want 1suburban train toKIA every 30 mins||Bengaluru: Passengers travelling to and from Kempegowda International Airport are relieved with the opening of KIA halt station. However, they say due to poor frequency and unpunctuality of trains, benefits of the facility aren’t being completely realised.South Western Railway (SWR) operated 10 trains a day to and from the halt station when it was inaugurated on January 4, 2021. However, services were suspended from April-end to November first week. At present, only two-pairs of trains (06387/06388 Bengaluru-Kolar-Bengaluru and 06383/06384 Channapatna-Kolar-Channapatna) are operational. A TOI team on Wednesday boarded 06387 KSR Bengaluru-Kolar from Byappanahalli railway station for a reality check of airport services. However, the train which was scheduled to reach Byappanahalli at 8.59am arrived only at 9.47am, a delay of 48 minutes. In fact, when asked for a ticket to the halt station, a railway official said he will not be responsible if there is any delay. The train reached KIA halt at 10.34am (47 minutes); the ticket fare from Byappanahalli is Rs 10. Bangalore International Airport Limited, which operates KIA, has arranged free shuttle bus services from KIA halt to the airport terminal. The TOI team reached the terminal at 10.46am. However, there were only two-three passengers in the bus. One of them remarked: “This is an awesome facility. It’s cheaper and faster and also provides a view of greenery along the tracks. It’s a different feeling as there are no traffic jams. But they (authorities) should operate at least one train every 30 minutes. People may miss their flights if SWR doesn’t provide reliable service. As of now, it’s suitable only for airport staff.” KN Krishna Prasad, railway activist and member of Karnataka Railway Vedike, said: “SWR could operate one train each per hour via Yeshwantpur and Channasandra so there will be a train via KSR Bengaluru City station every 30 minutes.”He said Yelahanka-Devanahalli is a single track. “SWR could double the section between the two locations and also upgrade Bettahalasur and Chikkajala/Doddajala to crossing stations. This will help it run more trains to and from KIA halt station,” Prasad added.It usually takes more than one hour by road to reach the airport from Byappanahalli. BMTC Vayu Vajra fare is Rs 230, and the trip costs around nearly Rs 1,000 if one uses an app-based cab. The halt station was built by BIAL at a cost of around Rs 3 crore and aimed at benefiting 28,000 airport employees as well as passengers. SWR officials said only 2,098 passengers travelled between January and April and it earned a ticketing revenue of Rs 20,830. AN Krishna Reddy, senior divisional commercial manager, Bengaluru division, was unavailable for comments.Full report toi.in||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/passengers-want-1suburban-train-tokia-every-30-mins/articleshow/87768675.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||... while women eye final berth||Bengaluru: It won’t be out of place to say that this is a coming-of-age season for the Karnataka women’s cricket team. The Veda Krishnamurthy-led side has been dominant in the BCCI women’s One-Day Trophy. They have been ticking the boxes with firebrand performance from the top-order batters, disciplined bowling and marked improvement in fielding.Karnataka will start favourites against Punjab when the two sides meet in the semifinals at the Alur cricket ground on Thursday. On a six-match winning streak, the Mamatha Maben-coached side will look to go the distance in the competition, having exited in the quarterfinals in the previous season. Attributing the success to teamwork, former India skipper Mamatha pointed out, “The team is a mix of youth and experience and everyone has been contributing. Veda has played a huge role in moulding this team. The team has been good over the past couple of seasons, but Veda has taken them up by a few notches with her leadership skills and ability to read the opposition well. Also, the support we have got from the KSCA, especially in these testing circumstances, has been unconditional.”On the performance of the top-order comprising S Shubha, D Vrinda and G Divya, Mamatha said, “They have been brilliant. In my five-year stint as Karnataka coach, this season has been the most satisfying because they have played to their potential.”Mamatha also praised the bowlers and the bench strength, which has been tested in every match as the starting XI has been different in all six matches. On playing Punjab, Mamatha stated, “We see it as another match. Although the goal is to finish on top, we are taking one match at a time. The team which performs better on the day will have the upper hand. So, we will focus on our strengths and play to our potential.”Both the teams will have an eye on the weather with rain predicted for Thursday as well. In the event of a washout, Karnataka will enter the final on the strength of the outright wins.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/-while-women-eye-final-berth/articleshow/87768677.cms||---

This discovery work has been published in the refereed journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, titled “Discovery of an inflated hot Jupiter around a slightly evolved star TOI-1789”.“This discovery was made using PRL Advanced Radial-velocity Abu-sky Search (PARAS) optical fiber-fed spectrograph, the first of its kind in India, on the 1.2 metre Telescope of PRL at its Mt. Abu Observatory. Using PARAS, which has the capability to measure mass of an exoplanet, the exoplanet’s mass is found to be 70% and size about 1.4 times that of Jupiter,” Isro said.While these measurements were carried out between December 2020 and March 2021, further follow-up measurements were obtained from TCES spectrograph from Germany in April 2021, and also independent photometric observations from the PRL’s 43-cm telescope at Mt. Abu. “The star is known as HD 82139 as per the Henry Draper catalogue and TOI 1789 as per the TESS catalogue. Hence, the planet is known as TOI 1789b or HD 82139b as per the IAU (International Astronomical Union) nomenclature,” the researchers said.This newly discovered star-planet system is very unique — the planet orbits the host star in just 3.2 days, thus placing it very-very close to the star at a distance of 0.05 AU (roughly one tenth the distance between Sun and Mercury).“There are less than 10 such close-in systems known among the zoo of exoplanets known so far. Because of the close proximity of the planet to its host star, it is extremely heated with a surface temperature reaching up to 2000 K, and hence an inflated radius, making it one of the lowest density planets known (density of 0.31 gram per cc),” an Isro statement read.Such close-in exoplanets around stars (with distance less than 0.1 AU) with masses between 0.25 to a few Jupiter masses are called “Hot-Jupiters”, the researchers said. “The detection of such a system enhances our understanding of various mechanisms responsible for inflation in hot-Jupiters and the formation and evolution of planetary systems around evolving and aging stars,” they added.This is the second exoplanet discovered by PRL scientists using PARAS at 1.2 m Mt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/inflated-hot-jupiter-around-a-sub-giant-star-discovered/articleshow/87768678.cms||---

Police said the gang recorded his dance and shared the video on two WhatsApp groups, where the main accused and the victim are members. KR Puram police have taken up a criminal case based on a complaint filed by Sujatha, wife of victim Sathish, against the gang. However, the main suspect, Dayal Manju aka Puli Manju, left for the US a day after a case was registered against him. D Devaraj, deputy commissioner of police (Whitefield), said the case was registered on Monday and police learnt that the main suspect went to the US via Delhi on Tuesday. Investigation is on to trace and nab the other suspects. According to preliminary probe, Manju and Sathish belong to the same community. A few months ago, Manju, a soothsayer, had given Sathish Rs 2 lakh. Later, Manju complained to his community leaders, saying Sathish hadn’t returned the money. On Saturday, Manju allegedly abducted Sathish in a car and took him near Mulbagal in Kolar district. The gang forced him to remove his clothes and made him perform snake dance. They recorded it and shared it on two WhatsApp groups of their community. The gang freed him later. The incident came to light on Monday, when Sathish’s sister saw the video on the WhatsApp group and informed his wife Sujatha. Sujatha rushed to KR Puram police station and filed a complaint against Manju and other unknown persons. Police registered a case under IPC sections 364a (kidnapping for ransom), 368 (wrongfully concealing or keeping in confinement, kidnapped or abducted person), 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) and section 66E of IT Act (punishment for violation of privacy) against the gang.

---||Bengaluru||Youth vanishes with Rs 3.5 lakh bike in Bengaluru, returns after police complaint||BENGALURU: A 20-year-old youth who had taken a Royal Enfield bike for a test ride from a showroom in Rajajinagar on Monday afternoon remained incommunicado for a few hours, prompting the staff to lodge a police complaint. While cops began efforts to get in touch with the youth, the bike was parked in front of the showroom later in the night. The showroom is located on Dr Rajkumar Road in Rajajinagar D Block. Around 1.30pm, the youth, identifying himself as Varun, dropped in and wished to take a test ride on a Royal Enfield Continental GT 650 bike. The showroom had a four-year-old bike for test rides. Varun handed over a photocopy of his driving licence and provided two of his mobile numbers. Showroom staff gave him the keys at 2pm and Varun, who was alone, rode away. When Varun failed to return, the staff grew anxious. “Usually, test rides last one or two hours at the most. We waited till 6.45pm in vain. We tried to reach him on his mobile numbers but they were switched off. Finally, the same night, we lodged a complaint with Rajajinagar police,” a showroom staffer told TOI. The FIR put the value of the bike at Rs 3.5 lakh. Cops booked Varun under IPC sections 379 (vehicle theft) and 420 (cheating). An investigating officer tried to contact him on his mobile, which was not reachable at that point of time. By 9pm, the bike was seen parked outside the showroom. The rider left the keys in the pouch of the bike and vanished before security personnel could question him, police said. “We will summon Varun, seek an explanation for the delay and parking it outside the showroom without communicating with the staff. As police station staff tried calling him on his mobile, he must have got to know of the complaint. Things will become clear only after we question him,” police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/youth-vanishes-with-3-5l-bike-returns-after-police-plaint/articleshow/87768685.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||BFC coach hopes for better show||Bengaluru: Looking to resurrect the team's fortunes, after the former champions settled for a disappointing seventh place last season, coach Marco Pezzaiuoli expects Bengaluru FC to put in a much-improved performance in the new season of Indian Super League beginning in Goa on Friday.The coach, who took over from Spaniard Carles Cuadrat, was not ready to read too much into the lack of experience in the absence of mainstays including Juanan, Dimas Delgado and Eric Paartalu and said his side has a good mix of experience and young talent. "The important part is the quality and mindset of the players. I'm not afraid that they (new players) don't know about the league. It's a new step as we lost Dimas, Eric and Juanan – crucial players of the BFC team. But we want to become younger," he said. "We have prepared well for the last two months. I think we want to be better than the last season. We will see a Bengaluru FC team that will try to reach the playoffs and we are working very hard for this."RELIANCE ON TRIOAsked about the Blues continued reliance on the trio of skipper Sunil Chhetri, Cleiton Silva and Udanta Singh for goals, the coach said: "It doesn't matter who scores and it's not like before when the striker doesn't defend. It's also about not conceding many goals (last season BFC scored 26 and conceded 28). In the end, I don't care who score the goals – defender, medio or striker. We also have many offensive midfield players."BATS FOR MORE GAMESThe highly rated Pezzaiuoli, who had stints in South Korea, Japan and China, also wanted more matches for the youngsters. "Twenty games in a season are not enough. You have five-six months of holiday only for preparation and you cannot develop a player. There needs to be a change if India wants to take the next step. “We need to change the league system and the youth system to give more matches to the youth players. (Maybe) we should start in the beginning of October to the beginning of May. You need to get up to 50 games a year to develop," said the coach.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bfc-coach-hopes-for-better-show/articleshow/87768721.cms||---

Facing more than 22 criminal cases, including three murders, Palani was recently booked in the murder case of Munnakumar, 35, reported in Bellandur on November 10. Munnakumar, a resident of Kasavanahalli slum quarters, was walking towards a shop at 8pm when a gang of four miscreants led by Palani stabbed him to death. Police claimed Munnakumar was innocent and had no criminal antecedents. Palani objected to Munnakumar walking freely at night and that led to an altercation, police said. Palani, who once sold kerchiefs for a livelihood, had attacked police twice earlier. Sleuths from the Organised Crime Wing-2 traced him near the cemetery at 11pm. A team headed by HS Parmeshwar rushed to the spot. “Palani resisted arrest, assaulted inspector Harish Kumar with a dagger and injured him on his left elbow. The ACP fired at his left leg. He has been admitted to Bowring hospital,” Sandeep Patil, joint commissioner of police (crime), said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/rowdy-attacks-cop-shot-at/articleshow/87768722.cms||---

The state government on Wednesday appointed him as the additional chief secretary of the department. Pathak, a 1990 batch Bihar cadre officer, was waiting for posting after returning from central deputation. Additional chief secretary (home) Chaitanya Prasad has been relieved of the additional charge of the department. It is the second time that Pathak has been given this department since CM Nitish Kumar enforced prohibition law in the state on April 5, 2016. Known for his strictness and honesty, Pathak has been entrusted with the responsibility of handling the department just a day after Nitish held a marathon meeting with his ministers and officers to review the loopholes in the implementation of prohibition law following a series of hooch incidents in the state claiming more than 50 lives in the last two months. The meeting concluded with Nitish’s message that prohibition must be enforced with an iron hand. Before he went on central deputation, Pathak was given the responsibility of mines and geology department when the government was facing illegal mining problems in the state and corruption issues in the department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/kk-pathak-back-in-prohibition-dept/articleshow/87766607.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Ahmedabad||Bopal, Vatva sinking along with groundwater levels in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: Amdavadis are pumping so much water from the ground that parts of the city are sinking. A recent study by the Institute of Seismological Research has found a strong correlation between land subsidence (sinking) and depletion of groundwater. Areas surrounding Bopal-Ghuma in the west and the industrial area of Vatva in the east are sinking 25 mm per year. “The water wells of Bopal, Arbudanagar, Hazipur garden and Ghuma indicate subsidence of about 2.0 mm/yr. Large ground subsidence of 9.8 mm/year is also estimated at Sola well, followed by a subsidence rate of 8.2 mm/year at Shilaj,” stated the study published in the Geocarto International journal, a reputed scientific journal published by Taylor & Francis. Experts say land subsidence is a cause of concern as it leads to micro-level topographic changes, cracks and fissures in the surface and ultimately causes heavy damage to city infrastructure like newly laid underground civic lines and even concrete structures on the surface. “The south-eastern part of the city and parts of neighbouring rural areas experienced high levels of subsidence. The west-central and east-central parts of the city reveal moderate and low subsidence, respectively,” claimed the study by ISR researchers Rakesh Dumka, Sandip Prajapati and D Suribabu. “Spontaneous water removal leads to vertical compression of aquifer sediments by reducing pore pressure and soil compaction resulting in land subsidence. Land sinking promotes micro-level topographic changes, cracks and fissures in the surface, ultimately causing heavy damage to city infrastructure,” says Dumka. “The Vatva well indicates a subsidence rate of 8.1 mm/year. Significant sinking of up to level of 3.0 mm/year is also estimated in the central part of the city,” states the study. The scientists had relied on groundwater level data from the central groundwater board between 1996 and 2020. They painstakingly used Sentinel satellite’s Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar data between 2017 and 2020, which measures ground deformation with an accuracy of sub-centimetre level, and the latest Global Navigation Satellite System-based precise technique to measure land subsidence. The scientists have appealed for greater public participation to arrest this phenomenon, including implementation of groundwater recharge in town planning schemes and its insistence in municipal governance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bopal-vatva-sinking-along-with-groundwater-levels-in-abad/articleshow/87766940.cms||Paul John

They alleged that the timing was changed without informing them beforehand. Bhupesh C H Negi, the director of the city airport, told mediapersons that SpiceJet’s Patna-Mumbai flight (SG-392) was rescheduled due to some technical problems. “All the passengers are being taken care of by the airline,” he added. According to sources, SG-392 was supposed to leave Patna at 11.30am and reach Mumbai at 2.15pm on Wednesday. It eventually took off at 9.50pm without any passenger. Asked about the “technical problem”, an official of the Central Industrial Security Force deployed at the city airport replied, “SpiceJet’s Ahmedabad-Patna flight (SG-391) landed at the airport on its scheduled time at 11am, but the airline detected some technical fault in the aircraft after which it did not fly to Mumbai.” On the other hand, Ritik Kumar, a passenger travelling by the Ahmedabad-Patna flight (SG-391), alleged that the oxygen level in the cabin air fell suddenly due to which many flyers fell unconscious. He tweeted, “Please take some action regarding today’s incident happened in Ahmedabad to Patna SpiceJet flight (SG-391). During flight oxygen level gone down for 15-20 minutes and oxygen bag was also empty of majority passengers. Due to which many passengers got unconscious (sic).” TOI, however, could not get in touch with any passenger of the Ahmedabad-Patna flight to verify the incident. Meanwhile, the passengers waiting for their flight at the Patna airport condemned the alleged apathetic attitude of SpiceJet towards them. Nandan Shandaliya, one of the passengers, tweeted, “Pathetic service at Patna airport as flight SG-392 was rescheduled at boarding time and no intimation was given beforehand. The airlines has no commitment towards its passengers. Not a single responsible person is available (sic).” Another flyer, Kshitiz Anand, rued, “This happens regularly at the Patna airport. Kids are crying and critical patients are desperate to reach Mumbai, but the airline does not care.” Niraj Kumar, who was also waiting to fly to Mumbai, said, “Since our flight was delayed, we were told we would get breakfast and lunch. We have, however, not received anything yet. The security hold area is crowded and there is no space to sit.” A SpiceJet employee, however, claimed, “Our ground staff assisted all the passengers.” As many as 160 flyers finally left for Mumbai by a special aircraft after 6pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/passengers-raise-ruckus-at-airport-over-7-hour-delay-in-spicejet-flight/articleshow/87765931.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Divyangi gives wolf-breeding a leg-up||AHMEDABAD: Divyangi, a disabled female wolf, has enabled Gujarat to launch one of India’s most ambitious wildlife breeding programmes, which involved a royal exchange — the state traded three lions to find partners for Divyangi and her sisters. The state, at that stage in 2016, had no male wolf. Now, Divyangi has birthed an initiative under which 30-zoo bred Indian wolves will be released into the wild in Banaskantha in December. A senior officer of the Gujarat forest department in Gandhinagar said that the programme began with Divyangi. She was brought to the Sakkarbaug zoo in 2010 with a severe impairment in one of her forelegs. Her treatment and rehabilitation protocol continued till 2016. Just five years later, she is being hailed as the heroine of the success story with a happy beginning: an extended family of 39 wolves. “Though Sakkarbaug is the leading zoo for Indian wolves, it had only three females and Divyangi had a disability,” the officer said. “The department, however, did not lose heart and gave an Asiatic lion each to Mysore, Jodhpur, and Jaipur zoos in 2016 and received one male wolf from each of them.” Divyangi found the Mysore male to be the lupine equivalent of Mr Right. In 2017, she gave birth to one pup. The next year, she delivered four more pups and the breeding programme was howling with triumph. Divyangi passed away in 2018, but her legacy will stride with packs spanning generations in Gujarat. The Gujarat forest department has received the approval from the Central Zoo Authority of India to liberate the 30 wolves into the wild in Banaskantha. The government issued a circular last week permitting the release of these wolves to control the nilgai population in the region. The circular notes that Sakkarbaug was made the key breeding centre for wolf conservation. Forest department officials said that the government has formed an eight-member committee headed by the principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) to oversee the release. A veterinarian from Junagadh and the Sakkarbaug zoo director are among the committee’s members The officer said that the committee has been asked to prepare an enclosure with a prey base within two weeks and then begin a soft release of the wolves. The officials said that the team has been asked to talk to the farmers in the area to avert human-wolf conflicts. The farmers will be made aware that the wolves will help control nilgai and wild boar populations that damage crops. The officials said that they had been awaiting the nod to release the wolves since April 2020. The officials said that Divyangi will be made the mascot of the programme. The first pup of Divyangi, Deepak, is now the male spearheading the breeding drive. Another senior officer associated with the programme said that in the past wolves were found in the thousands in Gujarat. But according to a recent estimate, there are now fewer than 400 in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/disabled-divyangi-gives-wolf-breeding-a-leg-up/articleshow/87766977.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

However, the Karnataka bench of the GST Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) may have put an end to the debate on whether or not eggs are an agricultural produce. The AAR was approached by SAS Cargo, which transports consignments across India using leased railway containers. It sought clarity on applicability of goods and services tax (GST) on transportation of eggs. The AAR said, in view of the notification No. 12/2017 dated June 28, 2017, eggs are indeed an agricultural produce. Thus, transportation of eggs will not attract GST. According to this notification, agricultural produce means any produce out of cultivation of plants and rearing of all life forms (except rearing of horses), for food, fibre, fuel, raw material or other similar products. The notification also requires that no further processing should be done on such items. Or, processing done by the cultivator or producer should be such that it does not alter the essential characteristics of the produce but makes it more marketable for the primary market. The GST commissioner whose comments were sought by the AAR was of the view that the intention of the notification appears to be to give relief to farmers who, in addition to cultivation, may undertake certain agro-based activities like animal husbandry, sericulture, etc. Whereas operating a hatchery and production of eggs is a commercial activity. However, the AAR held that ‘fresh eggs in shell’, on which no further processing is done, are covered under the definition of agricultural produce. Thus, transportation of eggs by rail from one place in India to another would be exempt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/aar-eggs-an-agri-produce-transport-not-to-incur-gst/articleshow/87767656.cms||Lubna Kably
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Success of Covid-19 vaccination drive hides inequality across districts||VISAKHAPATNAM: The first dose Covid-19 vaccine coverage has exceeded 85% in Andhra Pradesh. About 57% of the total eligible beneficiaries have been fully immunised with two doses. Andhra Pradesh is one of the few states in the country to achieve more than 85% first dose coverage. But there is a variation among districts in terms of the extent of the public that has received the inoculations. Vizianagaram and Srikakulam are lagging behind with about 76% first dose coverage, while some districts like Prakasam and Nellore have already achieved more than 90% coverage. Apart from vaccine hesitancy or complacency, the state health officials attribute the trend to migrations from these backward north coastal Andhra Pradesh districts. Srikakulam and Vizianagaram are the only two districts that are yet to cross the 80% coverage milestone in the state. Corresponding with their first dose numbers, Prakasam, Nellore and Kadapa have already administered the second dose to more than 60% of the eligible population in their respective districts. The number of eligible beneficiaries for Covid-19 vaccine in Andhra Pradesh has been revised to 3.95 crore. The health department had earlier estimated it at 3.47 crore people. As per the Union government’s communique, East Godavari, the most populous district of the state, has about 42 lakh beneficiaries. Officials have to give jabs to nearly 19 lakh people in Vizianagaram, the lowest number for any district in the state. The Union government sent 1.15 crore doses to Andhra Pradesh as its October allocation, the highest-ever doses given to the state in any single month, after it allocated 1.05 crore doses in September. The state will get 86.8 lakh doses in November, including 68.9 lakh Covishield doses and 17.9 lakh Covaxin doses. The state has so far received 5.4 crore vaccine doses from the Union government, while it has procured 21 lakh doses on its own. The first dose vaccine coverage among the 18-44 age group has touched the 72% mark. The health department has identified nearly two crore eligible beneficiaries in the 18-44 age bracket.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/success-of-vax-drive-hides-inequality-across-districts/articleshow/87766387.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The court will hear the case again on Thursday. Justice Abhijit Gangopadhyay declined to give more time to the School Service Commission (SSC) for inquiry after it unfolded that “no such recommendation letters” were issued by the four regions of SSC though copies of the letters were produced in court earlier. “It appears that some foul play has been committed in giving appointment on the basis of some recommendation letters which were not issued by the appropriate authority,” the court observed. Earlier in the day, the West Bengal Central School Service Commission secretary came under fire for being unable to come up with a response to the alleged foul play. The “foul play” came to light on Wednesday when SSC counsel Kishore Dutta submitted that the SSC Northern Region intimated the commission that it had not issued the recommendations. Dutta sought more time for investigation, pleading that the Commission had no intention to protect anyone. Justice Gangopadhyay declined the SSC prayer on grounds that the entire database in SSC computers “could be changed by a click of a button”. The court observed that it could order a CBI probe, if necessary. The judge asked the SSC counsel to come up with the response of the other three regions by 3pm. State counsel Samrat Sen submitted that “the matter really requires some enquiry” and proposed an investigation under a retired HC judge. The court before considering the SSC proposal directed the SSC to file an affidavit by 2pm on Thursday stating clearly that no SSC region, including the South-Eastern Region that was named earlier, issued any recommendation letters. The court also ordered the 25 people whose appointment letters were filed on Thursday as supplementary affidavits should be made parties to the case. The court also directed the district inspector of schools to stop their salary forthwith. Counsel for petitioners Bikash Bhattacharya drew the court’s attention to 500 such appointment letters that were issued in the meantime. “Appropriate order in this respect will be passed at any subsequent stage,” the court held.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/high-court-rap-for-ssc-foul-play/articleshow/87767449.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Women used as cover for cannabis transport||VISAKHAPATNAM: Posing as tourists, some drug peddlers, including women from parts of Andhra Pradesh, southern Odisha, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Telangana visit the tribal pockets in Vizag Agency and Andhra Odisha Border (AOB) areas and smuggle cannabis in cars to various destinations. The lure of easy money draws these women into the illegal business. Gangs deploy women to pose as tourists and facilitate the trade. With demand for cannabis increasing among students and youngsters in metros and cities, the gangs have been adopting innovative and sophisticated ways to transport the green drug from Vizag Agency and AOB. The interstate ganja smugglers use women from financially backward sections to transport the contraband in cars. “We have observed that some people in the guise of tourists visit tourist locations in Vizag Agency and procure the weed. They then transport it (between two to five kilos) in cars. During routine vehicle checks, some people posing as tourists were caught with weed. However, it is not possible to suspect every tourist to be a drug peddler and check their baggage,” said Narsipatnam ASP, V Manikanta. “We would intercept vehicles and examine the luggage only if we get credible information about the transportation of weed,” he added. Of the 1,188 prisoners in Vizag Central Prison who have been booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 28 male prisoners are serving sentences between one to 10 years. Of the 1,160 remand prisoners, 75 are females while some prisoners held for ganja smuggling are from other states, such as Tamil Nadu. Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, and Kerala. While the law is the same for every motorist, women motorists are often spared from baggage checks. Taking advantage of this practice, some gangs are roping in women to dodge the enforcement officials and transport the weed. Women smugglers earn anywhere between Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 per trip. Interestingly, women in the trade do not procure the contraband in bulk, fearing they may land in trouble. While transporting the weed, they use expensive cars to give the impression of visiting Vizag Agency as part of a trip. Meanwhile, in Vizag city, some women also supply weed to students and youngsters. “Though we arrested some peddlers, there are more out there supplying the contraband,” a senior police officer said.

The number of children enrolled in government schools increased from 76.9% in 2020 to 80.5% in 2021, compared to 2.8% rise in the last three years since 2018. The report also revealed that more children from the rural background took admission in the government schools, compared to private schools, between 2018 and 2021. The report was based on a survey conducted in the rural areas of 581 districts across 25 states and 3 union territories between September and October this year. It covered 76,706 households, 75,234 children in 5-16 age group besides teachers and staff of 7,300 government schools. Significantly, the proportion of both boys and girls enrolled in government schools across all grades increased from 2020 to 2021. The percentage of girls enrolled went up from 80.9% in 2020 to 82.9% in 2021 while the boys’ enrolment increased from 73.2% in 2020 to 78.2% this year.  The state education department launched ‘Praveshotsav’ campaign to enrol students in schools, especially from classes I to IX. Education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary said the department conducted a special campaign to ensure 100% enrolment of kids, who attain the age of schooling. “The education officials, teachers, NGOs, leaders at all level (including panchayats) and intellectual society were asked to admit the kids who were out of school. Now, we have the positive results of the campaign,” he told this newspaper. As per the report, the availability of smartphones to the enrolled kids also increased from 27.2% in 2018 to 54.4% in 2021. However, only 11.8% kids have access to studies all the time while 34.4% used the device for limited periods for education purpose. A large section of almost 53.8% enrolled kids still have no electronic devices for studies. Choudhary said the department was aware that maximum kids do not have access to electronic devices and internet facility for online studies. “Digital education has its own limitation in the state. It cannot replace the classroom education because of several challenges. Digital devices may lead to learning divide. The department has sent a proposal to the project approval board of the centrally sponsored Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan to provide electronic learning devices to kids studying in elementary schools,” the minister said. He added: “So far the financial involvement is concerned, states like Bihar cannot bear the cost. So, we have requested the Centre to provide electronic devices to kids for learning purpose.” The report highlighted that 73.5% of the school-going children took tuitions when schools were shut due to the pandemic, while 63.8% took help from family members while studying at home. Such children included 62% of government schools and 76% from private schools. Almost 89.4% kids received textbooks for their current grade compared to 75.8% in 2020, the report stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/enrolment-in-govt-schools-up-by-3-6-in-state-aser/articleshow/87765950.cms||Faryal Rumi

The ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ campaign, which kick-started on Tuesday, will continue till November 27, barring Sunday. Two days will also be utilized for routine immunization along with the Covid-19 vaccination. “It will be like a pulse polio campaign. So, the teams have been formed in such a way that there is one ANM in each team,” said state health department special secretary Sanjay Kumar, who also holds the charge of state society executive director. Apart from one ANM who will work as a vaccinator, there will be one verifier in each team. Three such teams will be headed by a supervisor. Sanjay said each team is to cover 125 houses in a day and all the 18,000 teams nearly 22.50 lakh households every day. As per the data with the department, 7 crore beneficiaries are supposed to take Covid-19 vaccines, but many of them are staying outside the state. “Hence, we expect less than six crore beneficiaries. It may stop by the time we reach 5.50 or 5.60 crore,” said an official. As per the data on CoWIN portal till Wednesday afternoon, over 5.16 crore people had taken first dose and over 2.13 crore their second dose. Majority of the beneficiaries who have not taken the shots are pregnant women. Though doctors said the vaccine was safe for them and the Union government has given its nod, the health department official said they will not force this group for vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/18000-teams-formed-for-door-to-door-vax-drive/articleshow/87765899.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The 33 cells were last reconstituted in March and April this year at the directive of the party’s the then national president Ram Chandra Prasad Singh, commonly known as RCP. Thus, in one stroke thousands of office-bearers, who were believed to be the supporters of RCP, were made designation-less. Moreover, the party removed all the 40 Lok Sabha and 243 Vidhan Sabha kshetra prabharis in the state. All these ‘prabharis’ (in-charge) were appointed on the advice of RCP when he used to control the organization as its national president. “JD(U) state president Umesh Singh Kushwaha has terminated the party’s cells and units as well as the appointment of all Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha kshetra prabharis with immediate effect,” party’s state general secretary (headquarters) Mrityunjay Kumar Singh announced. Although the termination order was officially issued by Kushwaha, insiders said it was done at the directive of the party’s new national president Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh. Lalan became the JD(U)’s national president on July 31, replacing RCP. Soon after taking the command of the party, Lalan expressed his concern over the constitution of “too many” cells. Lalan was of the view that these cells were running parallel units in the districts, leading to confusion among the supporters. Soon after taking over the party’s charge, Lalan had terminated the appointment of Vidhan Sabha prabharis of different cells. He had also put a break on further expansion of different cells in the state. JD(U) state general secretary Mrityunjay Singh told TOI that the cells and their units were terminated after a thorough discussion with the top leaders of the party. He added, “The party has decided to reduce the number of cells. Some of these, which have no political utility, will be closed. Fresh committees will be announced in future.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-terminates-all-its-33-cells-units/articleshow/87766061.cms||Madan Kumar

The park is adjacent to the world heritage Mahabodhi Mahavihara. When contacted, principal secretary of forest department, Dipak Kumar Singh, said, “It is a good initiative of Gaya division. We are also planning such initiative in Patna and other district headquarters. The plan would be executed in the Eco Park at Patna besides some other parks having big areas in Araria, Jamui and other districts.” Gaya divisional forest officer (DFO) Abhishek Kumar said the park will have a managed habitat for butterflies with ample amount of resources for adults and early stages. “It will be additionally supported with an open air interpretation centre to spread awareness among the locals as well as foreign visitors about the conservation of butterflies. The interpretation centre will have interactive information boards having contents on butterfly diversity in Bodh Gaya and ecological importance of butterflies. “The habitat will have designated plots for establishment and maintenance of the resources required for butterflies. Altogether 18,327 square feet area has been selected for intense plantation and remaining part of the park is to be used for isolated and sporadic strategic plantation. More than 4,000 plants of 55 species will be used to set up the habitat in and around the park throughout the year,” the DFO said. Butterflies will breed in the wild and lay eggs in the host resources. A percentage of larvae hatching from those eggs will be collected inside the laboratory. Regular rearing of butterflies will be carried out and freshly enclosed butterflies will be used to conduct butterfly release event. Temperature inside the rearing room will be controlled by airconditioner. The rearing centre will help enhance the number of butterflies in and around. The centre will felicitate the breeding of prominent species of butterfly, including lemon emigrant, common jay, Indian jezebel, blue mormon, common rose, plain tier, blue tiger, plains cupid, psyche, common crow, common leopard, striped tiger, common ciliate blue, commander and grass demon. In the Buddhist texts, the Bodhi tree is known as the tree of awakening under which Lord Buddha attained enlightenment. The tree is scientifically known as ‘Ficus religiasa’, which has an ancient connection with butterflies. Common crow, which is a regular visitor to Jai Prakash Udyan, uses the sacred tree to complete its life cycle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/butterfly-rearing-centre-developed-at-bodh-gaya/articleshow/87765885.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||'Andhra Pradesh can achieve decentralised development through less invasive ways’||VIJAYAWADA: Senior counsel Shyam Diwan appearing for Amaravati farmers on Wednesday concluded his marathon arguments explaining why, according to the petitioners, the legislations on three capital cities are illegal, arbitrary, violative of statutory rights of the farmers and against the doctrine of proportionality. Shyam Diwan submitted various judgements of the Supreme Court in support of his arguments on each ground he raised against the twin legislations. On the third day of arguments, Shyam Diwan said the issue of the capital Amaravati has to be looked at from a national perspective as the Union government provided funds for the development of essential infrastructure in the capital in pursuant to the State Reorganisation Act. After notifying the capital, preparation of master plan, grounding of works and contracts awarded, the state government cannot take a U-turn and stall the project. If laws like this are allowed to continue, no project will be possible as the reputation of the state is at stake. People will not believe any government to pool lands for any developmental works, he said. Arguing how the twin legislations are against the doctrine of proportionality, Shyam Diwan said the state government had already resolved to decentralise the development in 2014 in the assembly by developing three mega cities, including Amaravati as capital and 14 smart cities. Decentralised development can be achieved through less invasive methods without abandoning the existing and ongoing developmental works. The state government cannot destroy the value of the property and take away the right to property of the farmers, he said. Asserting that the twin legislations are manifestly arbitrary, Shyam Diwan said the state government cannot destroy the market that it has created. He said wilful non-adherence to priorities under the master plan in force which are to be completed in a time bound manner is nothing but arbitrary and cannot be allowed. He said the apex court categorically held that a change of policy after change in government cannot be allowed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/state-can-achieve-decentralised-devpt-through-less-invasive-ways/articleshow/87766434.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Subhash Trivedi, in-charge IGP of railways, told media on Wednesday that the procedure to register a case of abetment of suicide with the Valsad railway police station is underway and rape charges will be added after scientific report is available. Generally, a DNA report is made available in around 15 days. After a specific request from the cops in this case, the report is expected to come within three days. The cops are waiting for scientific reports before registering the rape offence so that the accused don’t get any escape window during the legal process, sources said. Currently registration of FIR of abetment of suicide against unidentified is under process. Sources said that police have also found witnesses who saw the girl sitting alone in a coach of the Gujarat Queen Express after it reached Valsad railway station. Giving details of the investigation, Trivedi said that the cops have also questioned accused who had committed sex-related crimes in Vadodara in the past, drug addicts, autorickshaw drivers and other suspicious persons. A few of them have been detained for further questioning, Trivedi added. Trivedi further said that since the case has links with different cities like Vadodara, Navsari, Surat and Valsad, police have collected CCTV footage from different parts of these cities including ST bus stand, railway stations. Sources said that around 35 autorickshaw drivers who operate around Chakli circle, Vaccine Institute ground and near the girl’s residence were questioned so far. Police had also questioned around 55 people including NGO staff, neighbours, security guards, the victim’s friends and others who were in regular touch with the girl. The bicycle which the victim was riding at the time of alleged kidnapping hasn’t been found yet. The girl was on her bicycle near the Vaccine Institute Campus in Vadodara before being allegedly kidnapped and raped by two unidentified persons in Vadodara on October 28. Two days later she arrived at her home in Navsari and during early hours on November 4 she was found hanging in Gujarat Queen Express.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/cops-groping-in-the-dark-about-rape-accused/articleshow/87766203.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Five puppies poisoned to death in north Kolkata locality||KOLKATA: Five puppies were found poisoned to death on Ramdhan Khan Lane in Sovabazar on Wednesday. The carcasses of the puppies, which were around a month old, were discovered by locals early in the morning. The sixth puppy survived the murder attempt and was sent to a pet clinic for treatment. Jorabagan cops said they have received a complaint that all the puppies were poisoned and Kolkata Police has launched a probe into the incident. “We have sent the carcasses for post-mortem and have registered a case under IPC sections 428 and 429 (mischief by killing or maiming animal) that carry a maximum punishment of five years. We have begun studying the CCTV footage of the area. We have tried to link a few locals who were found not in favour of these dogs and have identified a few suspects,” said an officer. Ayushi Dey, an activist who first got to know about the plight of the puppies, rushed to the spot and found five of them dead and one gasping for breath. After making arrangements for urgent treatment, Dey visited Jorabagan police station and lodged an FIR against unknown miscreants. “It is an unpardonable offence and the criminals should not be spared. It was one of the most gruesome killings of puppies I have ever encountered,” Dey told TOI. Jorabagan cops said they will carry out a post-mortem at the state forensic lab to ascertain the exact cause of death. The carcasses have also been preserved for viscera test as advised by a veterinary surgeon who initially examined them. According to a preliminary report, the dogs died of poison in food offered by “unknown persons”. Locals claimed several crows also died after eating the same food. Less than two weeks ago, another dog had died mysteriously in the area. Police said they suspect the stray was killed by a group of people from the nearby slums. “We will intensify our vigil to prevent such incidents,” said an officer. Dog lovers in the area, however, do not feel assured. They said someone who knew the movement of these dogs is involved in the killing. A section of locals blamed the dog lovers’ refusal to allow the relocation of dogs for the present incident. “There are dozens of dogs in the area which are fed by local dog lovers. After dark, these dogs become a nuisance, especially for kids. We have complained to KMC and police about this. Though no one has the right to kill animals, things wouldn’t have reached this point had the dog lovers cooperated with us,” said a local. Animal activists demanded stern action against the culprits. According to a KMC health department official, prevention of cruelty to animals should undergo a major change to book culprits who often don’t think twice before harming a stray dog.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/five-puppies-poisoned-to-death-in-n-kolkata-locality/articleshow/87767287.cms||Saikat Ray

It’s not longer just seasoned corporate executives or wealthy business owners but also mid-level professionals, techies in their thirties flush with hefty salaries and vested ESOPs, and conventional stock market investors joining angel networks and writing cheques to get in early on the action. Angel investment firms told TOI that inquiries and new members have risen by almost 5x in 2021 leading them to conduct more awareness creation for the new kinds of investors and ticket sizes of angel investments too have thus fallen from an average Rs 10-15 lakh to Rs 3-5 lakh. Zomato’s listing appears to be the inflection point for angel investing. “From young techies to senior executives, we are seeing investors who want to write the cheques and get their hands dirty and help startups grow in their early stages,” Padmaja Ruparel, co-founder, Indian Angel Network, said. More women, especially Bollywood actors, are also turning angel investors, she added. Indian Angel Network has over 500 members currently. “People from all walks of life are turning angels today and are part of multiple networks to get access to the deals and invest as well,” Pooja Mehta , CIO, JITO Angel Network, said. JITO has investors from Mysore, Erode, Guntur, Belgaum and Bhilwara, along with metros, she adds, noting that people from tier-5 and -6 have been some of the most active and smart investors. Mumbai Angels has seen inquiries and membership grow from mid- to senior level corporate executives wishing to dabble in this asset class and notes family offices are playing a more hands-on role in their portfolio startups by turning angels besides being LPs to large funds. “While 2020 was our best year ever with 35 deals and 36 exits, we have already surpassed these in 2021,” Nandini Mansinghka, co-founder, Mumbai Angels, said, adding that membership has grown from 500 to 650 in the last two years. Vinay Bansal, founder and CEO, Inflection Point Ventures, says that the firm has seen a 10x growth in member base in the last two years at around 5,500 now with many of them earlier having a 100% allocation to listed markets and now wanting to diversify. Early-stage investment firm LetsVenture says around 150 people used to join the network on a monthly basis earlier and this is up to 450-500 now. The activation rate — the rate at which the new investors make their first bet in the first week — has almost doubled, Nakul Saxena, head — fund strategy & investor relations, LetsVenture, said. “The euphoria of investing has also moved to smaller towns and we are thus increasing our efforts at educating and sensitising the first-time investors of the risks,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/more-indians-turn-angels-in-startup-funding-boom/articleshow/87767006.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

Skyrocketing prices of LPG and raw materials has forced hoteliers in Hubballi to hike prices from 5 to 10 percent. Hoteliers are finding it difficult to raise the prices, fearing low footfalls. After the lockdown was eased, hotels are receiving customers, and now hoteliers are expecting good business in the marriage season. In some hotels prices were hiked while some have hiked prices of premium items like dosa and puris, which require gas and edible oil in larger amounts than other dishes. Hubballi Hotel Association general secretary Ravi Gaitonde said, “Customer flow has still not improved in many areas. Because of rise in prices, the hotel industry was in trouble. There is no option left for hoteliers apart from hiking prices.” “Normally Hubballi Hotel Association will not take any stand on hiking prices. It is left to the hoteliers to take a call based on the circumstances in their area, and some have increased prices by up to 10%,” he said. If hoteliers decide to hike prices, they will calculate their expenses for gas, groceries, power, water, staff salary, building rent and others. Hoteliers will have to increase prices of all items and not just a select few, added Gaitonde. The unhealthy competition, mainly by street vendors and hotels that haven’t taken any license, is also forcing hoteliers to think before hiking prices. Krishnamurthy Uchilla, of Hotel Sri Krishna Bhavan, said they are still working out the prices of dishes. “With Covid-19, the hotel industry was completely hit. Still, we are struggling to stabilize the business. Amidst this, if we hike prices there is fear of losing business,” he said. Ramachandra, a hotel customer said some hotels have already hiked the price of tea to Rs 16 a cup. “One plate of idli is now Rs 35, from Rs 32 earlier. Dosa and poori now cost Rs 50 from the earlier Rs 45. If this situation continues, we will be forced to stop coming to hotels,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/hit-by-inflation-hoteliers-in-twin-cities-unsure-about-revising-prices/articleshow/87765392.cms||J Abbas Mulla

The stretch between the Mumbai-Agra highway near Dahava Mail to Nashik Airport near Janori had developed several potholes. The stretch has got a facelift as a four-lane road has been developed in this stretch. “We have approached district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal, who had instructed the officials to undertake development of the roads towards Airport. There is a need to put up streetlights and signboards along the roads to facilitate air travellers,” said Manish Rawal, chairman, aviation committee, Ambad Industries & Manufacturers’ Association. The industrialists said that the condition of the road has improved, it needs proper signboards and streetlights. When contacted, PWD officials said they will soon take a call on both electric lights and signboards.

The association has urged the high court to declare the provision under sub-section 9(b) in Section 125 of the Act as ultra vires. There are more than 6200 members of the association in Bihar. While hearing the writ petition on Wednesday, the division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar directed the state government to file its reply on the matter within four weeks’ time and fixed December 22 for hearing the matter again. The bench also directed the Election Commission of India (ECI) and State Election Commission (SEC) to file their separate replies within the same time period. The association has also prayed that the all requisition orders for deployment of its members in the ongoing panchayat poll be stayed during the pendency of the petition. Senior counsel Amit Srivastava, who appeared for the SEC with Girish Pandey and Sanjeev Nikesh in the matter, countered the association’s plea on the grounds that it was questioning the provision after a gap of 12 years since the amendment came into effect in 2009. He also apprised the court that seven out of the 12 phases of state panchayat elections had already been completed. Srivastava also submitted that the SEC acts as per the law, which has been enacted by the state legislature and the commission has no role in forming or amending it. The association was represented by Apurv Harsh, Manu Tripurari, Sujit Kumar and Prashant Bhordwaj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sbi-officers-body-challenges-deployment-in-rural-elections/articleshow/87765834.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The district recorded 49 cases per day on average between November 1 and 15 as compared to 78 cases in October. While the number of active cases has reduced from 618 on October 31 to 425 at present. Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the medical superintendent of Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), said the immunity in individuals coupled with vaccination has helped in preventing the rise of cases post-Diwali. The infectivity of the coronavirus has reduced and the Covid positivity rate has also dropped below 0.5%. Moreover, around 81% of the beneficiaries in Nashik city have been vaccinated partially or fully, he said. The infection is still there and everyone must continue to wear masks and maintain social distancing, he said.

Dr Raj Nagarkar, the vice-president of the Private Hospital Owners Association in Nashik, has expressed similar views. According to NMC hospital officials, the bulk of the fresh Covid patients are those who are not vaccinated. Meanwhile, the daily cases of Covid in the city have reduced to 24 cases per day on an average between November 1 and 16, against 28 cases per day in October.

---||Patna||HC seeks govt’s reply on criteria to appoint HMs||PATNA: The Patna high court on Wednesday sought the state government’s reply on its eligibility criteria for appointment of a teacher as headmaster (HM) in nationalised senior secondary schools. The division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar, while hearing a writ petition filed by TET-STET Uttirn Niyojit Shikshak Sangh challenging the validity of various provisions in the Bihar State Senior Secondary School Headmaster (Appointment, Transfer, Disciplinary, Proceeding and Service Condition) Rules, 2021, directed the state government to reply on the issues raised in the petition within four weeks’ time. It also directed the petitioner to file rejoinder, if any, within the same time frame and fixed January 19 as the next date of hearing. The petitioner has challenged the condition of eight years’ experience of a teacher for appointment as headmaster in the senior secondary section on the grounds that the government has appointed aspiring TET qualified candidates since 2014 and in no situation they will have the required tenure of experience. In addition to this, the association has also challenged the provision of no requirement of TET qualification for those candidates who have been appointed as teachers before 2012. It has also apprised the court that such classification is unreasonable and will lead to a situation that none of the headmasters getting appointed for nationalised schools will be TET or STET qualified. The petitioner has also cited the National Education Policy, 2020, in which TET qualification is a must for teachers’ appointment. The teachers’ association has termed these provisions for recruitment as a poor attempt to lower the quality of education in the state. The court didn’t bar the state government from initiating recruitment process, but observed that the final appointments of candidates as headmasters in senior secondary schools would depend on the decision in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-seeks-govts-reply-on-criteria-to-appoint-hms/articleshow/87765912.cms||Debashish Karmakar

While participating in a protest march as part of the ‘Jan Jagran Abhiyan’ of the Congress at Darbhanga, Jha said, “Everything has become so expensive that it is out of the reach of common people. Instead of making things easier for them, this government has made their lives difficult.” A 15-day nationwide ‘Jan Jagran Abhiyan’ has been launched by the Congress to highlight the issues of inflation and price rise. It will continue till November 29. Jha further said, “Similar protests will be carried out across Bihar.” Meanwhile, state Congress spokesperson Asit Nath Tiwari criticized the review meeting on prohibition conducted by chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday. He alleged that a large number of people who had been put behind bars in alcohol-related cases were those who had raised their voices against the illegal liquor trade in Bihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/congress-govt-has-made-peoples-lives-difficult/articleshow/87766024.cms||---

IMA secretary Dr Sunil Kumar told this newspaper that more than 200 doctors in the state had died during the pandemic and their family members were entitled to get a sum of Rs 50 lakh from the “Insurance scheme for health workers fighting Covid-19” under the Prime Minister’s Poor Welfare Package. “However, hardly 20% of the families of the deceased have been paid the money till date,” Kumar said. Earlier, BSHRC chairman justice (retired) Vinod Kumar Sinha had on October 7 last ordered that the doctors and other staff of both government and private hospitals who lost their lives during the pandemic would get full payment of insurance money of Rs 50 lakh each from the insurance scheme meant for the purpose. Justice Sinha observed that the reports received from the director-in-chief of the state health services and the additional secretary of the state health department confirmed that the families all types of doctors and other staff would be entitled to get Rs 50 lakh in case of death. The IMA also pointed that all the government and private hospitals were directed to keep their OPDs and emergency units open to fulfil the urgent medical needs of the ailing patients during the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ima-hails-bshrc-order/articleshow/87766037.cms||B K Mishra

---||Patna||RJD mocks state prohibition policy||PATNA: One day after review of the implementation of the state’s prohibition policy done by CM Nitish Kumar, the RJD brass led by leader of opposition in the state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Wednesday mocked the exercise and the decisions taken. They even fell short of demanding that the prohibition policy be revoked. While the hooch has claimed over 65 lives this month, the mafia elements run a liquor smuggling network, which has spread down to the village level. To short-circuit the import, distribution and consumption of the illegally procured liquor, a slew of decisions was taken at the Tuesday’s meeting while activating the village-level chowkidars to pass on the information about liquor availability and consumption in their villages concerned. Calling the review meeting as “so-called,” Tejashwi, who had raised 15 questions on Tuesday, tweeted on Wednesday: “If he (read CM) is serious about prohibition, then he should not have feared the real questions that reflect the ground reality, nor should he shy away from them.” Unlike Tejashwi, senior RJD functionary and former Rajya Sabha member Shivanand Tiwary mocked at not only the prohibition policy, but also called it impractical and shorn of any proper assessment of the ground situation. “If a leader is strong, he will get the proper impact assessment of his policy done. If the impact is negative, he withdraws the policy. Unlike that, a weak leader, fearing the likely dent in his image and authority, becomes adamant on continuing the policy even if it is flawed,” Tiwary said, falling short of saying that the prohibition policy should be withdrawn. He suggested that the Nitish government had failed in the implementation of the prohibition policy and, in fact, the policy is flawed and has failed in preventing the consumption of liquor in the state. In contrast, road construction department minister Nitin Navin said the CM’s review meeting was aimed at toning up the police force and the administration, as laxity in implementing the prohibition will not be tolerated. “Our government is transparent. Mass awareness campaign will also be conducted,” Navin said, and upbraided Tejashwi saying that “only those who indulge in wrongdoing will say that the prohibition policy has failed.” But, citing the National Family Health Survey report, Tiwary said more liquor is consumed in Bihar than in Maharashtra, which is not a dry state. “Between 2005 and 2016, the Nitish government first made the Biharis habitual liquor consumer, and then imposed the prohibition policy,” Tiwary said, adding that the CM should explain the number of outlets which were selling foreign and country liquor in the state before the imposition of the prohibition policy and also the quantum of revenue loss that the government has suffered. While around 3 lakh poor and Dalits have been put behind bars, it has also put an additional burden on the police force that has neglected the basic policing duty regarding crime control and police investigation, as also on the courts and the state’s prisons, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-mocks-state-prohibition-policy/articleshow/87765989.cms||Abhay Singh

The need for another bus terminal is felt to decongest the Patliputra Bus Terminal located at Mauza Pahadi on the Patna-Gaya road. The buses will be geographically divided between the existing bus terminal and the proposed one. During the inspection, the CM had discussions about decongesting the city roads and streamline interstate and intercity bus routes. Focusing on Patna’s future plan, the officials believed that another bus terminal at Bihta will be more feasible as the alignment of six-lane ring road will touch the location. Besides, an elevated road is under construction at Bihta where the second airport is also proposed. The operation of buses coming from northwest Bihar, Rohtas, Kaimur, Buxar, Bhojpur, Ara, Chappra and adjoining Uttar Pradesh and few city buses from there will be more feasible with the propects of developing the greater Patna. However, the CM will take the final call on this matter. The land requirement for the second bus terminal will be finalized by the district administration and the urban development and housing department. The area will be selected after considering different aspects to provide better transportation facilities to the commuters. The state transport department will prepare the transport mobility plan with all the stakeholders for the new bus terminal. According to sources, over 3,000 buses operate in Patna per day and more than 1,800 buses ply from the Patliputra Bus Terminal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-inspects-sites-for-another-bus-terminal/articleshow/87766006.cms||Faryal Rumi

It will not be a call from the senior officials of the police department, but from an accused of a cheating case. Strange, it may sound but the accused, a realtor from Anand, has been ordered to mark his presence before police through online means as the court allowed him to travel to Dubai for business purposes for one year. The accused Sanjay Shah, who is accused of cheating several people in a housing scheme in Waghodiya, was allowed conditional bail in February. He was asked to deposit his passport with the court, mark his presence every Monday and Thursday at Waghodiya police station and not leave India. But last month, Shah approached the court again to modify his bail conditions as he planned to travel to Dubai for business purpose. He told the court that he holds license in Dubai to carry out commercial business there so his condition of depositing passport with court and not travelling outside India be deleted or modified for a period of five years. The court of additional sessions judge A J Kanani allowed his application and modified the condition for a period of one year against a deposit of Rs 1 lakh before the trial court. Shah was, however, not allowed to not mark his police presence so the court asked him to make WhatsApp call on Monday and Thursday at 11 am to the sub-inspector and also share his Google location with the cop. The sub-inspector has also been asked to report the court about this exercise at the end of every month until Shah returns to India and deposits his passport back. Shah has also been asked to keep his mobile phone switched on all the time and also share landline numbers and two mobile phone numbers of his Dubai office manager or office staff to the cop and court before travelling to Dubai. The sub-inspector has been asked to provide a copy of the order to the Indian Embassy in Dubai for their information.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/mark-presence-with-police-via-video-call-from-dubai/articleshow/87766295.cms||Jay Pachchigar

Students from these schools will appear for the CBSE exam for Class X in the 2024-25 academic year. After the state government introduced the new education system as part of the New Education Policy, the state reorganised the school structure and introduced CBSE and English medium. Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy reviewed the education department with officials at his Tadepalli camp office on Wednesday, where officials said the new education system would be implemented in three phases from 2021 to 2024. They further said 25,396 primary schools will be merged with upper primary and high schools. In the first phase, 2,663 schools have been merged this year and the new education system introduced. The chief minister instructed officials to set up a special number to be prominently displayed at schools, for parents and guardians to report any issues that they face, and receive relevant updates/solutions. All issues logged through this number will be reviewed, and wherever necessary, officials will take action. The chief minister instructed officials to pay special attention to English, specifically aspects like pronunciation, diction, grammar, and accent. As dictionaries have been provided to all students, the chief minister said all students should learn three new words a day and how to use those words while speaking/writing. Speaking on aided schools, the chief minister stated that the handing over of aided schools to the government is completely voluntary. The government is providing an opportunity to entities that are not able to run their school to merge with government schools, and the aim is to ensure that children are provided with good education and quality facilities. The chief minister clarified that there is no compulsion for aided schools to merge and that it was inappropriate to bring politics into this.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cbse-gives-affiliation-to-1092-govt-schools/articleshow/87766450.cms||Gopi Dara

---||Kolkata||Covid jab camp at Eco Park for unvaccinated visitors||Kolkata: The New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) has started a Covid vaccination camp at the Eco Park dispensary in New Town, primarily for visitors who will arrive at the gates without vaccination. Hidco officials said that since Eco Park was reopened, it has been noticed that there have been many unvaccinated visitors. Looking into this, Hidco discussed with NKDA if spot vaccination could be done for such visitors before entering Eco Park. “The modalities were sorted out and the spot vaccination camp has started at the Eco Park dispensary. Five such visitors were vaccinated on Tuesday and this will now continue,” said an official. However, since 10 persons can be vaccinated from one vial, at least eight to 10 unvaccinated visitors would need to be there, officials said. “The visitors will have to wait till at least eight to 10 of them come,” said an official. NKDA have also started doorstep vaccination for the elderly and senior citizens in New Town following several requests from those who cannot step out of their houses to get their dose due to their old age or other health issues. A total of 27 such residents have been vaccinated at home in New Town till Tuesday. Family members of those who are getting vaccinated at home are happy over the arrangements. “My maternal grandfather is 88 years old and has multiple health issues. We were apprehensive that taking him out for vaccination may result in some other repercussions. He is also unable to move around much. So we were waiting for such a doorstep vaccination initiative. It was a very seamless process from sending a mail to NKDA to finally getting vaccinated. The entire process was completed within two to three days,” said Arijit Samaddar, whose grandfather Haripada Saha got the jab at his home in New Town. NKDA earlier conducted off-site vaccination camps at a few gated communities in the township and also conducted a vaccination on wheels drive to inoculate hawkers and street vendors. In adjacent Salt Lake, the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) has already inoculated over 95% of people with their first dose and is also trying to take up doorstep vaccination for those who cannot step out of their houses. BMC ward 31 authorities recently inoculated a few such elderly persons at their home. “My father, who is 84 years old, has suffered from a stroke and is bed ridden. He is also a two-time Covid survivor. Due to his immobile condition we could not take him anywhere to give him the jab. He will be benefited if such doorstep vaccination could be conducted,” said Sankha Subhra Chowdhury, a resident of Salt Lake IA block. Award for BMC The BMC on Tuesday received the Gold Skoch Award for municipal governance for Covid management. Dedicating the award to the citizens of Bidhannagar, BMC board of administrators’ chairperson Krishna Chakraborty said it was a joint effort and dedicated work of all the civic officials towards achieving the recognition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covid-jab-camp-at-eco-park-for-unvaccinated-visitors/articleshow/87766763.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The project is initiated as part of the Haritha Jeevanam scheme. The mission is to convert the university grounds into a fully carbon free campus. The programme aims at reducing the carbon content in the atmosphere by not letting the vehicles go inside the campus. For that, electric buggy cars, electric scooters and bicycles will be available in the campus. The people coming to the campus, including the students and faculties, must park their vehicles on the space allocated and have to take this electronic vehicle to travel to their respective departments. These vehicles will be available at the campus entrance itself. The service will be free of cost. Currently, there is one electric buggy car, two electric scooters and 75 bicycles. The electric buggy car can accommodate 11 passengers at a time. The authorities are planning to launch two more electric buggy cars and a few more bicycles in the campus grounds as part of the initiative. The new electric vehicles were purchased by using the university fund. They have also got donations from the alumni of the school of distance education. “The carbon free campus is for our upcoming generations. Our mission is to make the university grounds totally carbon free. “The campus is changing to a platform for the students to keep themselves happy. It is making facilities for the students to get a better atmosphere to study. This is the first stage of the project. We will include more electric vehicles and bicycles for the students, faculties and other people in the next stage,” said S Nazeeb, project coordinator. “Kerala University is setting an example by promoting this idea. Air pollution is one of the major issues we face at this juncture and I am happy to know as an alumnus that this wonderful initiative was put forward by the college which I had studied,” said Antony Raju, transport minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kerala-varsity-campus-on-carbon-free-path/articleshow/87766737.cms||---

With an existing centre in Madurai’s ELCOT region of 1,000 seats, Neeyamo’s second office is set to have an additional capacity of 1,600 seats at an additional 65,000 square feet in size. The company did not disclose the investment in the expansion. Neeyamo looks to ramp up its headcount in the Madurai region by around 1,200 persons in the year ahead, it said. The Madurai centre will focus on all of Neeyamo’s key lines of business including global payroll transformation, and the company said the talent there would be involved in the same work being done in Chennai , the US and other locations in “building cutting-edge global payroll products.” Neeyamo’s team in Madurai comprises technology specialists, implementation experts, compliance experts and customer support executives to support global clients. “We believe companies should create jobs where the talent is located rather than bringing the talent to the cities. We’ve identified around 20 cities to be remote delivery centres including cities in the Northeast, and we will look to expand in these locations in the next 12 months,” Rangarajan Seshadri, CEO of Neeyamo, told TOI.“When we started our first Madurai centre, we realised that there weren’t many companies based out of Madurai. We had a good number of people working in our Chennai centre that came from Madurai and neighbouring towns/cities that made us realise the uncaptured talent that Madurai had to offer. We are very pleased with the talent in Madurai. Culturally, people are very humble and grounded. The energy levels in our Madurai centre inspires all of us at Neeyamo,” he added. Neeyamo has around 3,000 employees covering more than 190 countries. It serves more than 350 customers worldwide. The company has increased its employee count from 1,500 to 3,000 in the pandemic year, it said, adding that 80% of this is in smaller cities including Madurai, Thanjavur, Nagpur, Belgaum and Aurangabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hr-tech-firm-neeyamo-expands-to-madurai/articleshow/87767027.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

The Bihar resident — Manoj Paswan — was handed over to his relatives by the members of the Missionaries of Charity Nabajiban Mother Teresa Home in Howrah. Paswan’s life is almost like a work of fiction. He allegedly faced near-death situations on a number of occasions. “While in his mother’s womb, his life was in danger and the doctors were worried. His mother decided to perform Chhath Puja despite warnings from the doctors. After the puja, she went into labour,” said Ambarish Nag Biswas of West Bengal Radio Club. The club was instrumental in tracing Paswan’s relatives to Rajouli village in Banka district of Bihar. As Paswan grew up, he started showing symptoms of an unbalanced mind. A few years ago, he went missing. Two years ago, he was spotted by the sisters at the Missionaries of Charity in Kolkata. “He was lying on the pavement in a senseless state. He was on the verge of dying when we rescued him,” recounted brother Sajan Joseph of the Nabajiban Home. Over the next few months, Paswan underwent treatment, including psychological therapy. “Gradually we began to see signs of recovery in him. We decided to get him engaged in feeding other patients. Later, he started assisting in the kitchen. A few months ago, we felt that he had recovered a lot and could now stay with his family,” Joseph said. Joseph contacted the Radio Club and sought their help. The members of the club shared Paswan’s photograph over a network and his family was found. Paswan’s family members, who had lost hope of getting him back, broke into tears when they received the call. On Chhath day, they arrived in Kolkata and a healthy Paswan welcomed them with a smile at the Howrah Home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bihar-man-nursed-back-to-health-reunited-with-family-on-chhath/articleshow/87767452.cms||Rohit Khanna

The fund house cited recent meetings between lawmakers and participants in the country’s ‘digital assets industry’. Invesco had announced the scheme where the underlying fund invests in listed equities of companies in developed and emerging markets that participate in the blockchain ecosystem. According to Invesco, the government meetings are likely to culminate in a new legislative framework being formulated. “In light of the above, we believe it is important for investors to fully understand all aspects before making long-term investment decisions,” a statement issued by the fund said. It added that new launch dates would be announced later. Invesco Asset Management (India) manages over Rs 53,747 crore across mutual funds, portfolio management services and offshore advisory schemes. It is an arm of the Atlanta-headquartered Invesco Group. Sebi had this week cleared the CoinShares Global Blockchain ETF FoF — the first such investment vehicle from India. CoinShares Group promotes digital asset investing and was the first to launch a regulated bitcoin investment fund in 2014. It also offered the world’s first bitcoin-based securities on a regulated exchange in 2015. The objective of the FoF was to invest in Ireland-based Invesco CoinShares Global Blockchain UCITS ETF. The joint venture fund holds a stake in bitcoin mining companies and crypto exchanges. This week, representatives of the industry dealing with cryptocurrencies met a Parliamentary standing committee on finance headed by BJP MP Jayant Sinha and called for regulating the cryptocurrencies as a ban could not be implemented. While the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has taken the stand that cryptocurrencies are a serious threat to financial stability, it has not been able to ban them after the Supreme Court overturned the central bank’s decision prohibiting banks from dealing with crypto exchanges. Reports that India has over 10 crore crypto owners had raised an alarm, although RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said that the numbers appeared to be exaggerated and that a majority of investors have bought only small amounts. He said that there was an attempt to establish that investment in crypto assets was widespread, which was not the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/invesco-puts-off-blockchain-fund-plan-over-regulatory-flux/articleshow/87767671.cms||---

Cricket fans began gathering outside the stadium’s gates by 3 pm, leading to snarls on Janpath, Lal Kothi, and Rambagh. Police chetaks and PCR vans, with loudspeakers, kept reminding fans to move away from the middle of the road outside the stadium as it was hindering the vehicular movement. As fans kept pouring in from all directions, traffic had slowed to a crawl by 4pm along major roads leading to the stadium, especially on Hawa Sadak and Sodala. Besides long snarls on Tonk Road and Rambagh circle, traffic moved bumper-to-bumper on Bhagwan Das Road on Sahakar Marg as evening peak hour traffic coincided with supporters heading for the sporting event. As the stadium began to fill in with fans, police had set up barricades to enforce one-way movement on Pankaj Singhvi Marg Road behind the stadium. The traffic situation had improved by 8.30 pm as many spectators had already entered the stadium, while evening congestion saw some respite on Rambagh Circle and Lal Kothi. Over 2,000 cops were drawn from different units to help maintain traffic and law-and-order during the match.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/residents-throng-sms-stadium-for-india-new-zealand-t-20-match/articleshow/87768213.cms||---

The company, which has four crore customers and has been digitally transferring over Rs 22,000 crore annually, has applied to set up a non-banking finance company (NBFC) to grow its lending business. Seema Prem, co-founder and CEO, FIA Global told TOI that the company has been able to leverage the small transaction data using artificial intelligence (AI) to optimise operations, enhance customer service and detect fraud. It employs cognitive AI, facial recognition & imaging and natural language processing to deliver financial products at scale to promote inclusion. The technology helps the company to predict the needs in a particular area, the cash requirement after netting deposits and advances, do cashless loan collections and also deliver investment and insurance services. However, unlike most fintechs the company will depend on feet on the street and partners to provide assisted digital banking services. The business correspondent aims to handhold the underprivileged customer to do every transaction offline that can be done through digital banking. “Although we are a late entrant having started operations in 2012, we are present in 700 districts and have over 350 community partners and over 25,000 banking outlets,” said Prem. It is also the largest non-bank facilitator of cross-border monetary transfer from India to Nepal. The game-changer has been the PM Jan Dhan Yojana, which gave a lot of visibility to the rural business thanks to the publicity given by the government. Demonetisation in 2016 gave a boost to digital and financial inclusion. She added that the pandemic has increased the focus on social security through a push for government schemes. According to Prem, FIA Global operates in areas where banks are not able to due to remoteness. Also, these areas are not serviced by ATMs as servicing of the machines is not feasible in these areas. Given that the business correspondent channel is cheaper than ATMs and can now extend services to new areas. Nine of the 12 public sectors have already partnered with IFA Global in addition to a few in the private sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/business-correspondent-fia-global-aims-to-be-a-neobank-for-inclusion/articleshow/87767772.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Business||Agarwal to split metals, oil biz from Vedanta||Mumbai: Metals tycoon Anil Agarwal plans to separate the aluminium, oil & gas and iron & steel businesses from Vedanta to form three separate entities as he reviews the flagship’s corporate structure. The Rs 86,863-crore Vedanta has a play in more than half a dozen segments including zinc, lead & silver, copper, and power. The biggest revenue contributor to Vedanta in fiscal 2021 was aluminium followed by zinc, lead & silver, and copper. Agarwal has appointed a group of Vedanta directors and external advisers to evaluate the spin-off proposal in order to unlock value within the commodity behemoth’s corporate structure. This, according to Agarwal, will create three independent companies, each benefiting from greater focus, tailored capital allocation based on business-specific dynamics, and strategic flexibility to drive long-term growth and value for all stakeholders. Agarwal’s latest plan comes a year after his move to delist Vedanta failed. A tighter grip over the cash-rich Indian commodity giant will help Agarwal reduce liabilities at his holding company. The metals tycoon didn’t specify a timeline for the proposed demerger. The move, said Vedanta, will also accelerate its plans to cut carbon emissions. “Many funds may not like to invest in Vedanta because the aluminium business’s carbon footprint is higher. Having separate entities may attract a broader and wider range of investors in their other businesses,” Dolat Capital Market analyst Prashanth Kumar told Bloomberg News. Vedanta has targeted to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and has pledged $5 billion over the next 10 years to accelerate this transition. The company’s shares more than trebled over the past year, from Rs 108 to Rs 338 now, as commodity prices rallied and demand for alloys boomed globally. Its market capitalisation on the BSE grew to nearly Rs 1.3 lakh crore from Rs 39,904 crore in a year. On Wednesday, the Vedanta stock closed 1.8% higher by end of trade on the BSE.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/agarwal-to-split-metals-oil-biz-from-vedanta/articleshow/87767688.cms||Reeba Zachariah

As per IMD records, this was only the second time in a decade that the city recorded such high minimum temperature for November. The last time minimum temperature scaled this high for the month was in the year 2018, when it touched 27.4 degrees. Wednesday’s minimum temperature recorded by the IMD Santacruz observatory was 5.5 degrees above normal. The IMD Colaba observatory recorded a minimum temperatures of 26 degrees which was 3.3 degrees above normal. Apart from the high minimum temperatures, the high humidity levels also added to the discomfort. The relative humidity recorded by the IMD Colaba and Santacruz observatory was 92% and 85%, respectively. This was higher as compared to a day ago when the IMD Colaba and Santacruz observatory recorded humidity of 84% and 65%, respectively. While the rest of the day continued to stay overcast, by evening a slight drizzle was recorded in most parts of the city such as Dadar, Goregaon, Ghatkopar, Andheri, Lower Parel and Malad. Citizens said the unseasonal rains took them by surprise. In the 12 hours ending 8.30pm on Wednesday, IMD Colaba observatory recorded 3mm rain, while the Santacruz observatory recorded 1.2mm. The highest 24-hour rain recorded in the month of November was 46.3mm in the year 2019. “Despite November rain, the weather is hot and uncomfortable. Hoping to get some relief from the sultry weather,” said a resident. As per IMD forecast, light rain and thundershower activity will continue till Thursday, but the weekend is likely to see dry weather conditions again. IMD said the drizzle was due to a low pressure area over east central Arabian sea off Goa and Karnataka coast. Meanwhile, the maximum temperatures recorded by the IMD Colaba and Santacruz observatory was 31.5 degree and 34.5 degree Celsius, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/whims-of-weather-mumbai-goes-from-being-hot-to-cold-to-hot-again/articleshow/87767641.cms||Richa Pinto

Track the pollution level in your citySeveral districts in the state are having ‘poor’ or ‘very poor’ air quality despite being far off from Delhi and Punjab where vehicular movement and stubble burning are some of the major reasons for smog. Jodhpur, which is quite far from Delhi, is also witnessing a deterioration in air quality. On Wednesday, Jodhpur’s AQI was 274, which is categorised as ‘poor’, in comparison with Jaipur’s 301, which is categorised as ‘very poor.’ The AQI in Udaipur was 286, Kota (334), Bhiwadi (356) and Alwar (141). Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board officials have attributed the deteriorating air quality to weather conditions. “Adverse weather conditions is a major reason for deteriorating air quality. Jodhpur’s air is sometimes poor and sometimes very poor and it is happening because pollutants in the air are not dispersing due to adverse weather conditions. Once weather improves, pollutants will disperse easily and the air quality will improve,” said Amit Sharma, regional officer (Jodhpur). In Jaipur, officials claimed that with the onset of winter, it becomes difficult for pollutants to disperse. Places where pollution is continuously adding up due to vehicular movement, dust, industrial pollution, construction activities and other such activities due to adverse weather, it does not disperse. Daily generation of pollutants in a weather condition in which dispersion is difficult makes situation worse. The members of Commission for Air Quality Management(CAQM)in National Capital Region and adjoining Areas have suggested measures control of paddy stubble burning incidences, control of dust from Construction and Demolition (C&D) activities, control of dust from roads and open areas and controlling vehicular and industrial pollution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/air-quality-deteriorating-due-to-weather-conditions-says-pollution-board/articleshow/87768222.cms||---

Only the ophthalmology and dental OPs were having doctors when the minister reached there at 8.20 am. Even though there was a long queue of patients at medicine OP there was not even a single doctor to attend them. Interestingly the board outside the gynaecology OP read ‘no OP today’. The minister later found that the hospital has seven doctors in the gynaecology department of this hospital, but none were present at OP. The hospital authorities were taken by surprise when the minister reached the hospital in the car of the director of health services. The authorities informed the minister that all the doctors were doing the rounds in the wards and hence they have not reached the OPs. The minister soon went to the wards with the hospital heads and found out that no doctors were present there. Till 9 am no doctors reported for duties at the OP wings even though the OP starts at 8 am in the government hospitals. The minister who verified the case sheets of the wards also found that the doctors are not having rounds in the wards regularly. The minister who fumed at the hospital heads urged the director of health services who had accompanied her to take strict actions against them. The minister also sought an immediate report from the DHS. The patients who have been waiting for the doctors raised several complaints to the minister and several of them spoke about the lack of government treatment benefits at this hospital. The minister who spent almost two hours in the hospital also noted that there was no ECG technician available at the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/health-min-makes-surprise-visit-to-district-hospital/articleshow/87766759.cms||---

Sonali Ambardekar said the attendant distracted her from noticing the meter reading which has to start from zero. “The attendant pretended my car fuel tank was not opening. He wasted 5-7 minutes on telling me to start the engine, shut and start again. I kept going in and out of my car. Suddenly, he shouted that the cap of the tank had opened and started filling up fuel,” she said. When she checked the meter, it was past Rs 500 so she complained to the attendant, who kept repeating how difficult it was to open the cap. Ambardekar then protested after which the attendant filled up fuel for up to Rs3,000 and went away. She complained to the supervisor who swiped her card for Rs2,500. “Did they know I was being fleeced? I want people arriving at pumps to be alert and ensure they are not cheated,” she said.

---||Kochi||Kochi: Biomining likely to start next month||KOCHI: After much discussions, controversies and delay, biomining of legacy waste on the solid waste treatment plant premises at Brahmapuram may be started next month.  Zonta Infratech, the private firm which is to carry out the biomining, has submitted the project implementation plan and social impact assessment (SIA) report to the state government, pollution control board (PCB) and Kochi corporation. Once these agencies and government give the nod, the work can be started within a few days, officials with the firm said. “We have submitted the project implementation plan and SIA report. Now, we are waiting for approval from PCB, Kochi corporation and the government. If everything goes as expected, the work can be started by mid-December,” an official with the private firm said. “The legacy waste is piled up in around 40 acres at Brahmapuram. As per our projection, around 32 acres can be freed and made usable for other purpose when we complete biomining,” the official said. The major advantage of clearing the garbage is that it will help reduce pollution of river Kadambrayar. As of now, leachate from the solid waste treatment plant and garbage stacked in the area is percolating into Kadambrayar which passes by. As per studies, around 5.5 lakh metric tonnes of legacy waste is there at Brahmapuram. The waste will be treated in a scientific manner so as to remove undigested organic matter. Then, the garbage will be screened or filtered. The plan is to use mobile screening machines — a system consisting of conveyors and screens or filters — for sorting out various types of waste. “If we use the conventional trommel machine, only around 10 tonnes of waste can be sorted a day. While using mobile screening machine, we will be able to sort at least 200 tonnes a day. We plan to use two mobile screening machines and expect to clear at least 50,000 tonnes of waste a month. If we can work extra hours, we will be able to clear around 70% of waste within five months of starting the work,” a source said. “We won’t be able to sort the garbage during rainy season. Clearing the remaining waste can be started only after the monsoon subsides in October-November, 2022. After June 22, we plan to focus on capping of non-reusable garbage,” he said. Around eight acres is required for capping non-biodegradable waste. Big pits will be dug up in the eight acres and polythene cover will be laid on the surface of the pit so that the waste won’t come into direct contact with the soil. A layer of soil or landfill waste will be laid over the non-biodegradable waste. Hazardous chemicals will be given to the hazardous waste treatment plant at Ambalamugal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/biomining-likely-to-start-next-month/articleshow/87766774.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Jaipur||Director of private firm nabbed in RSLDC racket||JAIPUR: Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) on Wednesday arrested a senior official of a private company in the Skill and Livelihoods Development Corporation (RSLDC) bribery racket. ACB officials said that one Abhinav Sisodiya was arrested for his alleged involvement in seeking a bribe from the complainant. “He is a director of a private company that oversees the operation of the corporation. Two representatives of the same company, Badri Nath Sunder and Akash Kirodi were arrested earlier because they had sought a bribe from the complainant by promising to remove the firm from the blacklist,” the official said. The ACB claimed that Sunder and Kirodi had made the WhatsApp call while Sisodiya was booked because he had provided the number of the complainant. “Sunder and Kirodi demanded a hefty bribe, but the complaint said he could only offer Rs 2.5 lakh, but the duo replied that it was a very small amount,” the official said. ACB had busted the bribery racket in September when sleuths arrested scheme coordinator Ashok Sangwan and an assistant lecturer who was on deputation as a manager of the corporation Rahul Kumar Garg. Both were arrested while taking a bribe of Rs 5 lakh. The agency had also seized the mobile phones of two IAS officers — chairman Neeraj K Pawan and MD Pradeep Gawande — to probe their role. Officials said besides the two officials, the probe is underway against several other persons for their alleged involvement in the racket. A charge sheet was recently filed before the court on November 10 in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/director-of-a-private-firm-nabbed-in-rsldc-racket/articleshow/87768226.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Air pollution major cause of COPD: Docs||Jaipur: Air pollution may lead to difficulty in breathing. On the World COPD Day (November 17), doctors claimed that air pollution was one of the major reasons for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Doctors say that COPD commonly occurs due to significant exposure to noxious particles or gases. It is being increasingly recognised that women who use chulha or biogas for cooking purposes (common in rural areas), are at a high risk of COPD. In addition to that, exposure to air pollution, occupational factors and repeated respiratory infections increase the risk of COPD. “Persistent exposure to the risk factors and repeated respiratory infections can aggravate the underlying COPD leading to a lung attack. The lack of awareness on COPD contributes significantly in preventing people from seeking help and reaching out to their doctors. Identifying the signs and symptoms of COPD and lung attack, and getting timely help from a physician is the best way to prevent further worsening of disease progression. If smokers and other people with risk factors understand that they can get a lung attack which requires urgent medical attention, they will seek help early. Timely diagnosis of the disease is important which can be done by regularly checking lung function in patients who are symptomatic and at risk of COPD,” said Dr Virendra Singh, pulmonologist and former superintendent, SMS Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/air-pollution-major-cause-of-copd-docs/articleshow/87768224.cms||---
---||Nashik||Nashik mayor gives nod to hire staff on honorarium||Nashik: After a marathon debate between the ruling BJP and the opposition, city mayor Satish Kulkarni gave his nod to hire temporary staff on honorarium basis on Wednesday. Mayor directed the civic administration to hire temporary staff in all the departments of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) as per the norms and at the earliest. Leaders of the BJP and the opposition, led by Shiv Sena, were engaged in a fierce verbal spat during the general body meeting on this issue. The opposition members vehemently opposed the proposal claiming that it was an agenda of the BJP in view of the upcoming civic elections. The Sena leaders said that the code of conduct for the civic election will come into effect by the year-end and it would not be possible to complete the recruitment formalities in this short span. The leader of the opposition from Shiv Sena, Ajay Boraste, said that recruitment has not taken place in the civic body during the last 20 years. “The BJP had brought proposals to recruit staff on honorarium basis four times during the last four years, but the civic administration ignored the proposals in this connection,” he said. NMC officials informed that there are 7,717 approved posts and 2,979 of these are vacant. The administrative cost of the civic body, which was 29.83% in 2019-20, has increased to 37.90% in 2020-21 and 38.29% in 2021-22 due to Covid pandemic and implementation of the seventh pay commission to the NMC employees. Congress’ senior corporator Hemlata Patil questioned the move when the administrative cost is over 35%. Sudhakar Badgujar of Shiv Sena said the civic administration will have to send the proposal to the state government for its approval. Mayor said the recruitment could not be done earlier as the priority was to save people from Covid. Finally, the general body gave its approval.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-mayor-gives-nod-to-hire-staff-on-honorarium/articleshow/87765189.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Delhi||BJP targets Delhi govt on handling of air pollution crisis||NEW DELHI: BJP on Wednesday hit out at chief minister Arvind Kejriwal over the Delhi government’s handling of the pollution crisis in the capital, alleging that it had spent more on promoting the bio-decomposer solution than it did on purchasing it. Citing an RTI reply and also an answer provided by the Delhi government in the assembly, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra claimed that the AAP government had spent Rs 40,000 on purchasing the decomposer from Pusa and 310 farmers in the capital had benefited from it. Patra said the Kejriwal government had spent a huge amount on "educating" farmers across the country about the product. He accused the Delhi CM of blaming other states for the problem while doing little himself. Patra said that if farmers of Punjab and Haryana were the responsible for the air pollution in Delhi, then these two states should also have been more polluted than the capital. He noted that the Supreme Court had also pulled up the city government for its attempt to blame municipal bodies, which are run by BJP. Delhi BJP president Adesh Kumar Gupta, who was also present at the press conference, accused Kejriwal of dealing with the crisis "casually" and noted that most of the promises he had made to tackle the issue remain unfulfilled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-targets-delhi-govt-on-handling-of-crisis/articleshow/87767677.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kochi corporation fails to use 110 acres productively||KOCHI: Despite owning around 110 acres at Brahmapuram, Kochi corporation authorities have failed to use the property in an effective and profitable manner. Ironically, the property has become a burden for the cash-strapped corporation. Of the total 110 acres, more than 65% of the land remains unused. At the same time, the local body has the huge responsibility of paying the additional compensation of around Rs 160 crore to land owners whose holdings were bought in 2009. Originally, the corporation had purchased around 35 acres at Brahmapuram for setting up a solid waste treatment plant during 2005-06 period. After starting the waste treatment plant on the said premises, local residents came up with protests demanding the government to take over their holdings also. The residents’ argument was that they are unable to live there due to the foul smell emanating from the garbage. Finally, government took over around 75 acres from the local residents. Though the government paid compensation to the land owners, they moved the court for additional compensation. Now, the corporation is paying instalments of Rs 5.5 crore each to pay the additional compensation of Rs 160 crore. The existing windrow compost plant, operating from a dilapidated building, is not functioning effectively. So, the authorities have decided to construct a waste-to-energy plant. As per the plan, it will require around 20 acres for constructing the waste-to-energy plant. The government has already allotted five acres to IMA to construct a biomedical waste treatment plant. Another five acres houses a sewage treatment plant. Barring these facilities, a vast area remains unused. If various plants are operated in a scientific and odour-free manner, the remaining land can be used for setting up other facilities. The corporation, for example, is on the lookout for three acres for constructing a modern slaughterhouse. The slaughterhouse at Kaloor, which lacks even the basic facilities, can be shifted to Brahmapuram. Then, the precious land at Kaloor can be used for more productive and beneficial projects.

Along with the CM, ministers, MLAs, MLCs, MPs and other elected representatives across the state will also take part in the ‘Maha Dharna’ at Indira Park. Though the TRS had held a few protests and dharna earlier, including during Bharat Bandh, CM KCR, who is also the TRS president, had never participated in any protests personally. KCR, who on Tuesday had announced that the party would hold dharna against the attitude of the Centre on paddy procurement policy, also wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday on the issue. Minister T Harish Rao and Talasani Srinivas Yadav visited Indira Park on Wednesday and reviewed the arrangements. Harish Rao later told reporters that the dharna was being held to press the BJP government at the Centre to spell out its stand as the saffron party’s local and central leadership was creating confusion among farmers. “TRS always fight for the people whether in power or not. We also protested transferring seven mandals to Andhra after formation of Telangana in 2014. Now, our demand is that the Centre should adopt same policy for all states. Our dharna is not aimed at showing of strength, but to press for our demand,” the minister said. He alleged that the Centre was trying to evade its responsibility in purchasing rice from the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-to-sit-on-dharna-for-1st-time-after-becoming-cm/articleshow/87767668.cms||---

Shaikh lodged a complaint against Babulal Saiyed, accusing him of an inappropriate post about him on social media. In 2019, the court issued a bailable warrant when the complainant failed to remain present in court. The warrant was cancelled later on the same day. According to the accused’s advocate, Imtiyaz Pathan, on Monday during the hearing, the MLA was absent again and this led the court to issue a bailable warrant against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/warrant-out-for-mla-over-court-absence/articleshow/87766781.cms||---

The vehicle has been registered in Maharashtra. The vehicle was seized from Irumbanam on Monday. A Kochi native, who brought the vehicle from Maharashtra, has been asked to pay Rs 25,000, tax of three months. The tax amount of the caravan is fixed based on the length of the vehicle. If the seized vehicle has to operate in the state for one year, tax of Rs 1 lakh will have to be remitted to the government. The vehicle has been currently parked at the workshop belonging to the department. It will be released when the tax amount is remitted. Recently, MVD officials seized three caravans, registered in other states, brought to Kerala as part of shooting at Munnar. It has also been noted that many vehicles which transport goods items operate in the state without paying road tax. “Delay in paying road tax or not paying tax is because of financial constraints caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. When we seize the vehicles, the owners pay tax,” said a MVD official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/caravan-seized-for-not-paying-road-tax/articleshow/87766792.cms||---

Hearing the writ petition filed by Congress corporators Varsha Jane and Trupti Lakhe on Wednesday, the bench headed by Justice M I Arun told the government to submit its statement on the issue by November 29. The petitioners claimed that MLCs Laxman Savadi, Tulasi Munirajugowda, Bharati Shetty, Pratap Simha Nayak, Leher Singh, Raghunath Malkapure and Dr Talwar Sabanna had filed online applications to include their names in the list in Kalaburagi city, on October 23. “They have violated the guidelines for voters' addition. They also made the council secretary to instruct the Kalaburagi DC to shift their nodal district to Kalaburagi,” they added. Former Congress corporator Huligeppa Kanakagiri alleged the BJP MLCs have created a rent agreement with their party workers to add their names to the voters’ list. “However, they have not deleted their names in the district, from where they were shifting to Kalaburagi. Legally, they may be right. But it shows that the BJP can go down to any extent to grab power. We will also file another petition against the regional commissioner who has postponed the mayoral polls, citing the reason of MLC elections,” said Kanakagiri. The Kalaburagi city corporation elections saw a fractured mandate, with neither of the three major political parties securing complete majority. The results were announced on September 6 along with two other corporations of Belagavi and Hubballi-Dharwad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/kalaburagi-corporation-row-hc-issues-notice-to-seven-mlcs/articleshow/87765559.cms||---

The GRMB through letters had asked the state government to share information about the projects to take over the projects as per the gazette notification issued by the Union ministry of water resources finalising the jurisdictions of both Krishna and Godavari boards in July this year. The jurisdiction came into effect on October 14. The board sought information like sanctioned posts, plants. machinery, equipment, office premises, furniture, vehicles, DPRs and records maintained since inception. The members raised the objections during the GRMB sub-committee meeting held on Wednesday. The officials protested against the preparation handing over note of Godavari Lift Irrigation Scheme (Devadula) intake pumphouse at Gangaram and Geesukonda cross regulator on Kakatiya Canal as GRMB team visited the sites without involving the sub-committee members. The officials said as there were no common projects, there was no necessity of deployment of Central Industrial Security Forces (CISF) which would be a burden on the state government. “As per clause 4 of Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal award, states can transfer part of their share to any basin. GLIS and Sriram Sagar project were sanctioned by AP. AP had no objection for transfer of water from Godavari basin to supply irrigation water to areas in Krishna basin. Now, post- bifurcation, AP is objecting to this transfer, which is not acceptable to Telangana and is against the GWDT award,” a senior official of Telangana said.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Devendra Fadnavis restless after losing power, shouldn’t stoop so low, says Sharad Pawar||NAGPUR: A day after opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis slammed the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition as the “most corrupt” in Maharashtra’s history, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar launched a counter attack on Fadnavis’s home turf saying he had become restless after losing power. In Nagpur for a three-day tour of Vidarbha, the MVA’s chief architect on Wednesday urged the former CM to accept the reality. “I can understand that BJP state president Chandrakant Patil is making such (inflammatory) statements (on Amravati riots), but I am surprised over Fadnavis making them. He shouldn’t stoop to this level.” The octogenarian, however, lauded Union minister Nitin Gadkari saying he helped everyone irrespective of background or party. Refusing to comment on the riots and Shiv Sena’s demand to ban an organisation allegedly involved in fomenting the trouble, the NCP chief said whatever happened in Tripura, its repercussions should not have been felt in Maharashtra. “It’s a very sensitive issue where some people are trying to give it a communal colour for their obvious political benefits. Whosoever is responsible for the riots must be brought to book. I had asked home minister Dilip Walse Patil to visit Amravati to take stock of the situation,” he said. Defending his close aide and former home minister Anil Deshmukh, Pawar said injustice was meted out to him as the complainant (former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh) has himself gone missing and had stated that he had no proof. “Now, Singh may be declared absconder as he is not responding to the cops, but Deshmukh is in jail.” Regarding MPCC president Nana Patole’s repeated jibes against NCP, the Maratha strongman said his party still followed Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru’s ideologies, even though they were not part of Congress. “We are working together in the MVA government and we are more or less similar to Congress. A person, who won Lok Sabha and assembly polls on the BJP ticket, would have this mentality.” Emphasizing on the need for a third front at the national level to fight the BJP in the 2024 general elections, the former Union agriculture minister said he would meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi and West Bengal CM Mamta Banerjee during the forthcoming winter session of parliament. “It’s not important who will lead the front, its formation is necessary. We will take people’s help.” On whether MVA constituents would jointly fight forthcoming civic polls in the state, the NCP chief said it was not yet decided as the elections were being held at the local level where every party wanted to field their own activists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-fadnavis-restless-after-losing-power-shouldnt-stoop-so-low/articleshow/87767715.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Hyderabad||Telangana BJP seeks clarity from own party on CM K Chandrasekhar Rao’s paddy claims||HYDERABAD: BJP state unit has urged the party brass in Delhi for clarity over chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s claims over paddy procurement blaming the Centre for uncertainty. After KCR addressed the media on Tuesday night and requested the Centre for clarity on procurement and remaining stock of paddy in the current season, the state party leadership and the national party had a frantic conversation over it. While the national party instructed them to wait three days, party leaders are expecting a more forceful response from any of senior cabinet member. “We hope that someone like Piyush Goyal responds strongly to the developments in the state,” a prominent leader stated. Following the CM’s address, top brass from Delhi enquired about the situation with state leaders. Union jal shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat responded to numerous queries posed by the CM over the water dispute with neighbouring Andhra Pradesh a few days ago. “Similarly, one of the ministers would respond to the current paddy situation,” a top source said. Union minister of tourism G Kishan Reddy had already responded to the TRS government claims about the paddy procurement. The BJP state unit informed the national party about chief minister KCR’s counter-allegations. “Over the following several days, many Union ministers are expected to respond to the CM’s claims; this is a right opportunity for us to attack the TRS government,” sources added. According to insiders, party chief Sanjay would also speak to national leadership in the coming days to seek a clarification on the procurement of remaining stock for this season. “Ever since the paddy issue became a hot topic, the party brass has taken a keen interest in the developments in the state and observed the TRS stand,” they claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-bjp-seeks-clarity-from-own-party-on-kcrs-paddy-claims/articleshow/87767708.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Waqf tribunal orders removal of Pir Mohammed Shah Dargah trustees||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat State Waqf Tribunal has ordered for removal of all 21 trustees of Pir Mohammed Shah Dargah Trust and appointment of a Class-1 Muslim officer as administrator, who will be tasked with managing the affairs of the trust having numerous properties and also to hold elections for new trustees and mutavallis (caretakers). Tribunal’s chairman A I Shaikh and member Rizwan Qadri were upset with the management of the trust and held the trustees and caretakers responsible for not putting in efforts to increase the rent income from as many as 320 properties spread over the commercial areas in the Walled City and in Kadi and Viramgam towns. The tribunal noticed that the present rent amounts range from Rs 50 to Rs 57,000, and if the rent is fixed according to the jantri rates, the trust’s income may increase significantly, and it can work for the welfare of the poor and needy. The tribunal also took notice of the fact that the trustees did not even bother to help the poor in the taxing Covid-19 times when the downtrodden required support from such charitable organisations. It said that the trust had Rs 2 crore in fund but did nothing to help people during the pandemic. Acting on an application seeking removal of the trustees including president Mohammed Shafi Maniar, the tribunal ordered the administrator on November 11 to initiate concrete actions to enhance rent of trust’s properties considering the provisions of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2013 and the Waqf Property Lease Rule, 2014. It has ordered the present trustees to hand over all documents related to trust’s accounts to the administrative officer. It has observed that despite an earlier order, the trustees did not undertake efforts to raise the rent income and if any losses were incurred to the trust due to mismanagement, the trust can recover the loss from their pockets. The tribunal was critical of the trustees’ inaction, who allegedly did not raise the rent amount fearing action from tenants. It said that such an excuse is shocking. It also said that meek persons are not fit to manage the trust who do not act on apprehension that it may bring infamy to the trust. The tribunal also said that despite earlier order not to repeat mutavallis and trustees for more than two terms, they have continued to be in the office for decades. The tribunal has no problem with long incumbency, but it is trustees’ responsibility to conserve the properties, raise rent income and to extend help to the poor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/waqf-tribunal-orders-removal-of-pir-mohammed-shah-dargah-trustees/articleshow/87766835.cms||---
---||Nashik||Unseasonal rain damages crop, tomatoes sell at Rs 80/kg in retail||Nashik: A drastic drop in the tomato supply in the biggest wholesale market in Nashik’s Pimplgaon Basawant has led to the prices going north in both wholesale and retail markets. While the average wholesale tomato prices have gone up marginally in a month, from Rs 24 per kg around a month back to Rs 35 a kg now. The retail prices of good quality tomatoes have doubled from Rs 40 a kg around a month back to Rs 80 a kg now. According to the agriculture market produce committee officials, tomato production has dropped due to prolonged unseasonal rains. The arrival of tomatoes declined from 34,000 quintals a day in October to around 14,600 quintals a day at present at that market. The tomatoes auctioned at the mandi are not only supplied to Nashik and parts of Maharashtra, but also to various states in the county. In August, the average wholesale tomato prices had crashed from Rs 20 a kg to Rs 2.5 a kg due to bumper arrivals of the crop. But the heavy rainfall in September damaged the tomato crop in the district to a large extent, resulting in a steady rise in tomato prices in October. On October 14, the average tomato price was Rs 24 a kg at Pimpalgaon APMC, while the prices had increased to Rs 40 a kg in retail markets of Nashik. In October, the daily supply was 34,000 quintals a day at Pimpalgaon. Deepak Gavli, who takes care of tomato auctions at Pimpalgaon APMC, said that the supply of tomatoes has drastically reduced due to damage to tomato crops due to heavy rain in September and October. “The average tomato prices had increased up to Rs 45 a kg on Tuesday, but reduced to Rs 35 a kg on Wednesday due to rise in supply in the local markets of UP and Bihar. The average wholesale tomato prices are expected to be the same for the next few days until the supply increases,” said Gavli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/unseasonal-rain-damages-crop-tomatoes-sell-at-rs-80/kg-in-retail/articleshow/87896138.cms||Tushar Pawar

In the meeting, which is also likely to be attended by bureaucrats of both states, the key agenda of asset distribution would be discussed. Sources said that the talks will mainly focus on properties in Haridwar, Udham Singh Nagar and Champawat districts. “Both sides aim to resolve the issue at the earliest. Some important decisions are likely,” a source told TOI while adding that the high-level meeting will commence at 11 am and is expected to go on for an hour. While Uttarakhand was carved out of Uttar Pradesh in November 2000, the neighbouring state continues to have ownership of several properties, including land and canals, which lie in the Himalayan state. However, there has been some progress on this front since 2017. Soon after assuming office, Uttar Pradesh (UP) chief minister Yogi Adityanath handed over the rights of 37 canals to the irrigation department of the Himalayan state. Later, the UP government also handed over the ownership of Alaknanda Hotel at Haridwar to Uttarakhand. The recent round of conversation is likely to benefit the irrigation department, power department and transport department of Uttarakhand. Several buildings — currently under the jurisdiction of Uttarakhand but controlled by UP’s irrigation department — are likely to be transferred to the Himalayan state after the meeting. Besides distribution of properties, several issues related to energy, transport, finance, awaas vikas, public works, animal husbandry, forest, rural development, education, social welfare, drinking water and sanitation departments are pending between the two neighbouring states. Further, the issue of UP allowing water sports at Upper Ganges Canal in Roorkee also remains pending.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/21-years-on-talks-between-up-ukhand-cms-still-on-over-division-of-properties/articleshow/87766001.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole urges CM Uddhav Thackeray to cut taxes on fuel||MUMBAI: State Congress president Nana Patole on Wednesday urged Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to forthwith reduce state taxes on petrol and diesel for providing relief to the common man, who is reeling under spiraling prices of petroleum products. “We must understand the plight of the common man. If Congress-ruled Punjab and Rajasthan can reduce the prices of petrol and diesel, then I think it should not be difficult for the chief minister to consider our proposal. I feel that the decision on reducing the prices of petroleum products should be taken on top priority,’’ Patole said. Patole alleged that ever since Narendra Modi took over the reins of the country seven years ago, the NDA government has been ‘looting’ people. The prices of petrol and diesel were marginally reduced only after the NDA suffered a debacle in the recent by-elections, but at the same time it continued to loot the people by imposing heavy cess on petroleum products. “From March 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021, the central government has usurped over Rs 30,000 crore from the state governments as revenue from excise duty. The NDA government is economically exploiting the poor people by increasing the cess on fuel,’’ the state Congress chief said. Patole said the NDA government is levying a central excise duty of Rs 27.9 on petrol and Rs 21.8 on diesel. As per rules, the state government is supposed to get Rs 11.16 on petrol and Rs 8.72 on diesel, while it is given only 56 paisa on petrol and 72 paisa on diesel. He demanded that petrol be priced at Rs 60 a litre in view of declining crude oil prices in the international market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-cong-chief-urges-cm-to-cut-taxes-on-fuel/articleshow/87767737.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Tipped off, the Satellite police arrested Ankit Parmar, a 24-year-old resident of Sanskar Tower on Science City Road, with 21 bottles of Indian Made Foreign Liquor. In his complaint, Ramesh Bhupat of the surveillance squad said that the team was on surveillance on Tuesday night when the cops received information that a grey car with Rajasthan registration plate was parked at Dev Arc Mall. The person was selling liquor from the car. The cops stated in the FIR that as they walked to the mall parking lot, they spotted the car and Parmar was in the driver’s seat. Cops checked the car and found two blue plastic bags on the rear seat. The bags contained 21 IMFL bottles. Parmar failed to produce the permit for it and was detained. He was later arrested and questioned about his source. An investigator said, “This is a new modus operandi where a person was selling alcohol illegally from the parking space in a mall. The person was sitting in his car and supplying it to his customers. “They pretended to be customers visiting shops in the mall and walked out with the liquor without undergoing any checks,” a cop said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-held-selling-imfl-in-sg-road-mall-parking-area/articleshow/87766859.cms||---

The announcement assumes significance since there is brewing discontent against the BJP in Char Dham towns, particularly Gangotri and Kedarnath, with the teerth purohit (priest) community strongly opposing the Char Dham Devasthanam Board Act -- which brings 50 temples under government control. Political observers believe that this discontent may benefit AAP in Gangotri. Interestingly, the political history of the Gangotri seat has built up a belief that the party which wins this seat goes on to form the government in Uttarakhand. Meanwhile, Sisodia also participated in a roadshow and addressed a public gathering at Ramleela Ground in Uttarkashi. Addressing the gathering, Sisodia said, “Colonel Kothiyal has stepped into politics for the development of Uttarakhand and he will definitely live up to the expectations of the people.” The senior AAP leader also slammed Congress and BJP for the poor condition of the Himalayan state. “The successive Congress and BJP governments in Uttarakhand have not delivered on their promises. Despite being a power-generating state, Uttarakhand has to pay heavy electricity bills,” Delhi deputy CM. Meanwhile, Colonel Kothiyal called Uttarkashi his karmbhoomi and said, “Earlier, I fought for the safety of the country and now I am fighting for the betterment of people.” Notably, Kothiyal has served as the principal of the Nehru Institute of Mountaineering (NIM) in Uttarkashi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/aap-cm-face-col-ajay-kothiyal-retd-to-contest-from-gangotri-seat/articleshow/87766017.cms||Gaurav Talwar

While the Apni Sarkar portal will provide state residents online access to 75 facilities of nine departments, the Unnati portal has been developed to help senior state officials keep an eye on the status of projects. “The portals would be used to dispose of the complaints in a time-bound manner. These facilities will help every citizen of the state,” he added. Ramesh Kumar Sudhanshu, principal secretary, information and science technology department, said that through the Apni Sarkar portal, people will be able to secure their character certificate, caste certificate, income certificate, birth and death certificate, employment registration, old age pension, widow pension and specially-abled pension while sitting at home. All certificates will be integrated and stored in Digital Locker, he added. Meanwhile, the project plans of all departments of the Uttarakhand government will be proposed through the Unnati portal, which has been developed to ensure inter-departmental coordination.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Pani-puri vendor gets 10-years rigorous imprisonment for sexual assault on 2-year-old girl||MUMBAI: Observing that there is no substance in the defence submission that removal of garments was essential to establish sexual intent, a special POCSO court convicted and sentenced a 31-year-old pani puri seller to 10 years rigorous imprisonment for sexually assaulting a 2-year-old girl in 2016. The conviction came in the absence of the child’s deposition in court. The court reasoned, “The child was of so tender age that she was incapable of understanding the nature of the act, and she was incapable of being examined in this court as a witness.” The accused used to sell pani puri in front of the child’s house. Among the dozen witnesses court also relied on the statements of the child’s aunt who found her crying with abrasions on her private parts and a neighbour who saw the accused taking the child and then returning with her bawling. A doctor said that sexual assault could not be ruled out. “All the star witnesses examined by the prosecution deposed naturally before this court, thereby inspiring the confidence of this court. Their testimonies could not be shattered on behalf of the accused. There was no reason at all for them to implicate the accused falsely,” the court said. The court said there is no substance in the defence submission that pointing a finger at a person does not reflect his culpability or that the name of the accused should have been stated by the child. “It is a matter of common prudence that a kid would continue to weep, if it is hurt by any person and would merely point its finger, instead of stating the name,” the court said. The court also observed that it is a matter of general child psychology that a child would point its finger at any person who hurts her. The accused was found guilty for the offence of aggravated penetrative sexual assault under the POCSO Act. While the court accepted that the crime was heinous, it said that it is also to be considered that no severe physical harm was caused by the accused. “The child was not carried to any unknown place or to any longer distance, to take more undue advantage. The minimum punishment provided for the offence of aggravated penetrative sexual assault would meet the ends of justice, considering the age of the accused and also, considering the above circumstances,” the court said. The child would stay with her aunt while her parents were away at work. It was alleged that on March 30, 2016, at around 4.45 pm, her aunt heard her crying. Until then, the child was playing in the verandah outside the house. The aunt found that the child was crying on the staircase outside the house and both her hands were on her private parts. It was submitted that when the aunt enquired with her, the child pointed her finger towards the accused. The aunt found fresh blood stains on the child’s undergarments and abrasions on her private parts.

---||Vijayawada||Student enrollment in AP govt schools jumps||Visakhapatnam: Andhra Pradesh is one of the few states that have witnessed an increase in the student enrollment in government schools over the years as per the sixteenth ‘Annual Status of Education Report (Rural) 2021’ released on Wednesday. For children in the age group of 6-14, enrollment in the government schools has increased to 71% in 2021 from 62% in 2018 in AP. This shift is seen in all grades and among both boys and girls. The maximum increase in government school enrollment is seen in Uttar Pradesh and Kerala. Other than Telangana, all southern states have witnessed an 8% increase in student enrollment in government schools between 2018 and 2021. If parental education is taken as a factor, only 56% of the highly educated parents are sending their wards to government schools in Andhra Pradesh. This is almost 91% for the parents in the ‘low’ education category. As per the ASER, the school education report facilitated by non-profit Pratham, the availability of smartphones in households has almost doubled since 2018. About 72% of the total pupils in Andhra Pradesh currently have smartphones available at homes compared to a mere 42% in 2018. However, 18% of them do not have access to these smartphones for their studies. This means only some 60% of students have full-time or partial access to smartphones for studies. The study identified digital divide among the students with children from families having low education and no resources like smartphones had less access to learning opportunities. There is evidence of effort even in these households. Parents have been purchasing smartphones specifically for their children’s education. In 2020, about 4% children had taken private tuition classes in Andhra Pradesh. This proportion jumped to almost 23% in 2021. About 96% of the enrolled children have textbooks of their current grade. ASER 2021 was conducted in 25 states and 3 Union Territories during September and October, 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/student-enrollment-in-ap-govt-schools-jumps/articleshow/87766032.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

---||Surat||Gujarat: Four arrested for religious conversions in Bharuch||SURAT: Four of the nine persons accused for forcible religious conversion in villages of Bharuch district were arrested late on Tuesday night. A complaint against the nine persons was lodged after a man who was converted with the lure of a good job filed a complaint with Amod police station. Preliminary investigation had revealed that around 100 people from some 35 families were converted with inducement of money. Investigation of the case was handed over to deputy superintendent of police MP Bhojani. Police arrested Abdul Aziz Patel alias Ajit Chaganbhai Vasava, Yusuf Jivanbhai Patel alias Mahendra Jivanbhai Vasava, Ayub Barkatbhai Patel alias Raman Barkatbhai Vasava and Ibrahim Punabhai Patel alias Jitu Punabhai Vasava, all natives of Kankaria village of Bharuch. Their interrogation revealed that they received money from other accused persons which they used in luring other villagers for conversion. Children of converted families also started their study in nearby Darul Uloom. Families were also taken to mass prayer on Friday, police officials said. Two accused - Salauddin Sheikh and Umar Gautam - against whom Vadodara special operation group (SOG) had registered case on August 24 will also be questioned if needed to ascertain if they were involved in Bharuch religious conversion racket. Gautam and Shaikh are currently lodged in the Vadodara jail. Police sources said the racket was operated in a very organised way and the accused had pre-planned sending money and facilities required to lure people for conversion. Police is also investigating the route through which funds were sent from abroad. Many people who converted are yet not ready to give a police statement. Arrested persons are those who are directly connected with people and played the main role in luring villagers. Vadodara SOG had informed Bharuch counterparts after they had registered a case against Salauddin, a managing trustee of Aafmi Charitable Trust and Mohammad Umar Gautam on August 24. Abdullah Fefdawala, a native of Nabipur village in Bharuch and resident of London in the UK, had allegedly sent Rs 80 crore to Salauddin via FCRA and hawala. Sheikh used this money to finance conversion, building a mosque in the target area and help the accused nabbed during a demonstration against CAA and NRC in Delhi get bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/four-arrested-for-religious-conversions-in-bharuch/articleshow/87766211.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Net issues force rural schools to restart classes||PANAJI: Even as the government still debates whether schools should reopen for students from Classes I to VIII, managements of some rural schools — impatient with poor internet connectivity and lack of devices — sought special permission from the government, got their parent teacher associations’ (PTA) nods, and got going with offline sessions for younger students. For some schools, the return to physical classes began as early as September. In Canacona, the Shree Nirakar Education Society runs five schools, with a combined strength of 1,000 students. Soon after the Ganesh Chaturthi vacation ended, the management started conducting physical classes for students from Class V to VIII on alternate days. “We will be opening our schools in Mashem and Gaondongri right from the primary section from November 22,” said the society’s head, Prashant Naik. “We have been running classes from Class V to VIII, and we have not had any problems. The positivity rate is presently down in the state. CM should now say ‘bivpachi garaz na’ and open schools.” In Bicholim, the Vidyavardhak Mandal Educational Society had similarly started conducting physical classes for students of Classes VII and VIII on alternate days from October. Society chairman Vijay Sardesai said that they are now looking to reopen schools right from Class I from Monday. “Some of our students did not have mobile phones, and we provided them with phones through sponsors. How many can we provide with devices? We have 4,300-4,500 students studying in our four institutions from Classes I to XII. A majority of them come from interior areas, and do not have internet connectivity to attend online classes,” said Sardesai. He said that the school is presently seeing attendance of 95%. Insistence and support from parents was a driving force for the schools. Even in the case of Classes X to XII, the society was the first to start physical sessions with special permission, even before the state could give its nod to all schools. “The parents told us that their children are facing difficulties. So we held a meeting, and parents gave us the green signal to start classes. We started by following all SOPs. Parents are very happy with the way we are conducting classes. We have formed a team to monitor students for symptoms,” said Sardesai. The management even saw a visit from the state task force to check the functioning of physical classes in its schools. “In Class XII itself, we have 700 students, so we sat them in classrooms at 50% capacity. We have the infrastructure for it. We have already started sanitising the premises to start classes from the primary level,” Sardesai said. Many low-enrolment schools in rural areas like Sarvan, Karapur, Pilgao, Maulinguem, Kuchirem in Bicholim taluka have also started conducting physical classes, to assist students dealing with poor connectivity. “The last academic year 2019-20 was lost due to Covid, and students were lagging behind,” said Tukaram Sawant from Sarvan, Bicholim, the parent of two children studying in Classes VII and VIII. “So the school authorities called a meeting of parents and it was discussed that if the schools have low enrolment, there should be no issue of social distancing. The decision turned out to be successful. It tremendously benefited the students, after such a prolonged break from school.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/net-issues-force-rural-schools-to-restart-classes/articleshow/87767775.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

---||Dehradun||Peyjal Nigam: Mussoorie residents face hardships due to dug up roads, 'sub-standard' work||MUSSOORIE: After weeks of monsoon rains and waterlogging, now frequent digging up of roads across Mussoorie by Peyjal Nigam for laying pipelines under the Yamuna-Mussoorie drinking water scheme is causing a lot of inconvenience to the local residents.  People have complained of "inefficient management, no prior notice as well as sub-standard work" during the pipe laying process. “Peyjal Nigam has dug up the road near our school without giving any notice. There is not even adequate space for residents and school students to walk on this narrow hill road while all vehicular traffic has been stalled. In case of an emergency in the school even the ambulance won't be able to reach the premises,” said Arackal Kurian, a teacher of Wynberg Allen School. Kurian added that proper notice must be given to residents before digging the roads while the work must be done in a manner so that sufficient space is there for pedestrians to walk. “While the entire town has been dug up, the repair of roads post digging is of extremely poor quality. The dug-up roads have deep potholes even after repair work, posing problems for pedestrians and motorists,” said Rajat Aggarwal, president of Mussoorie Traders' Association. When contacted, Vijay Chauhan, executive officer of Mussoorie Municipal Council (MMC), said that the work is being done by Peyjal Nigam and if the quality of road repair is poor he would issue notice to the concerned department. Speaking to TOI, Sujeet Kumar Vikash, executive engineer of Peyjal Nigam, assured that the potholes would be repaired and also adequate efforts would be made to timely notify the residents prior to digging up any road. “While this is an important project for the town, it is also desirable that the public should not face inconvenience due to this project and proper repair of roads is ensured after laying the pipelines,” urged Geeta Kumai, ward member of MMC. Mussoorie faces acute water scarcity during the summer months as the peak season water demand is around 14.5 million litres per day (MLD) while the availability of water is only around 7.67 MLD. Under this project, water from Yamuna river would be pumped up to Mussoorie to meet the drinking water requirements. The project has an outlay of Rs 124 crore and has a capacity to pump up to 12 million litres of water per day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/peyjal-nigam-residents-face-hardships-due-to-dug-up-roads-sub-standard-work/articleshow/87766052.cms||Anmol Jain

The realtor Paresh Akbari, his friend Vimal Bambhva and the three killers Mehul Pargi, Rajesh Parmar and Kishan Jethwa were arrested on Wednesday. The victim Manoj Vadher, who was unemployed, was killed as he used to get drunk and beat his wife Falguni. Falguni had asked Akbari, with whom she had extra-marital affair, to free her from her husband’s torture. Interestingly, it was the initial investigation done by Falguni and Vadher’s family members that led the cops to the killers. Vadher was found dead on the morning of October 28 near railway tracks with head injuries. Police had registered a case of accidental death and suspected that he may have been knocked down by a running train. Falguni and the victims’ family members, however, used to visit the spot where the body was found and speak to people living near the railway tracks. On November 4, she gave a complaint to police to lodge a murder case after a person told her that he had seen two men arguing over alcohol around 9pm on October 27 and later one of them hit the other on head with a stone. While investigating Falguni’s version of events, the crime branch received information that Parmar was with Vadher on the night the latter died. Parmar was picked up for questioning. Later, Parmar confessed that he and two others had taken a contract to kill Vadher. His two accomplices Pargi and Jethwa were also arrested and their statements led police to Akbari and Bambhva. Akbari told police that he had planned the murder to free Falguni from the torture of her husband. However, Falguni has maintained that she had no idea that her paramour had planned the murder. Police are questioning Falguni to know whether she had any involvement in the crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/unemployed-mans-death-on-tracks-turns-out-to-be-a-murder/articleshow/87766158.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The case has been handed over to the detection of crime branch (DCB) that is now trying to track down the parents who pushed their children into the drug trade. “Mohnisa Munshi and her brother Shaqib Munshi, who are well-educated, used to hang out near the educational institutes and colleges in the city. They used to gel with the youngsters and get them addicted to drugs. It was easy for them to find customers at such places,” said a crime branch official. They also used to target youngsters working at big firms in commercial complexes as well as those visiting beauty parlours. During their questioning, the brother-sister duo revealed that about 25 to 30 youngsters used to buy drugs from them regularly. Apart from Mohnisa and Shaqib, their friends Meet Thakkar and Nupur Sehgal, who works for a multinational company (MNC), too were arrested by the cops. All the four were remanded to police custody for one day on Wednesday. The cops are yet to arrest Abdullah Patel and his wife Zarina, parents of Mohsina and Shaqib. The police said that Mohsina had come in contact with Dilip, a resident of Anand, when she was studying there. Dilip told her about his drug trade following which Mohsina discussed it with Zarina. The entire family then decided to get into the drug trade for earning some quick money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/over-30-youngsters-were-their-regular-customers/articleshow/87766305.cms||---

And there is a possibility that a person or a group is behind this snooping of officials of the tax department, which is now trying to approach the company to seek its help to gather clues about the culprits behind it. Meanwhile, police have already started a probe in this case and a hunt is on to identify the person who bought the SIM cards recovered in the GPS devices. Additional deputy commissioner of police (investigation) Jagatpreet Singh said, “We have received a complaint from the office of mobile wing of the state taxation department, Ludhiana. They have handed over a SIM which was in the GPS device, and they have also shared important details about this case based upon which we are trying to zero in on the accused.” Sources said the state tax department officials are now trying to contact the company to know who bought these GPS devices and from which channel (e-commerce website or company dealer), date of activation and from which mobile number and IP address these were being monitored. Source said the senior officers of the state tax department have ruled out the role of an insider and the hand of some passers (members of organised gang comprising transporters and other persons involved in facilitating illegal movement of goods without paying tax) or transporters was being suspected. The case has left everyone, especially officials of other state and Central departments connected with investigative work, shocked. Some of the departmental heads have asked their officials and staff to remain vigilant and keep checking their vehicles for any such snooping device.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/snooping-case-all-gps-devices-in-taxmens-vehicles-of-same-firm/articleshow/87766049.cms||Mohit Behl

---||Goa||Property prices in Goa set to rise by 10-15%, says Credai||PANAJI: Alarmed by the sustained increase in prices of construction raw materials, including cement and steel, the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (Credai) on Wednesday urged the government to rein in the escalating prices. Credai-Goa said failure to tackle the skyrocketing prices will push the state’s real estate prices by at least 10-15% in the near term. Developers said that while construction costs increase, there is no provision in the Real Estate Regulatory Act and norms to revise and increase the cost of an apartment or home once the initial agreement has been signed. “We have been consistently witnessing sharp increase in the raw material prices over the past year and they don’t seem to be decreasing or stabilising in the near future,” said Credai-Goa president Nilesh Salkar. “The developers may not be able to absorb escalating costs and, unfortunately, will have to pass the burden to homebuyers,” Sale of residential properties saw a rebound during the festive period, but developers have also seen prices of almost all materials and commodities shoot up consistently since last January. “Add to this the delays in construction caused by lockdowns, curfews, and shortage of labour causing increased labour costs, led to a direct increase in construction cost anywhere between 10-15% in the past 18 months,” said Salkar. Credai has suggested that the Centre should permit escalation of prices by allowing a clause in the buyer-seller agreement. “The government may also consider either allowing input tax credit for real estate projects and rationalisation of GST on various construction raw materials from their current rates as this would bring down the prices of residential properties,” Salkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/property-prices-in-goa-set-to-rise-by-10-15-says-credai/articleshow/87767786.cms||Newton Sequeira

Of the 11 days, the AQI was poor on 10 days, with possible health impacts as “breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure”. On one day (November 9), the AQI was 306, which comes under very poor category, with possible health impacts as “respiratory illness on prolonged exposure”.This is for the first time after 2018 that the city’s air has remained poor for these many days in a row. In October 2017, the AQI was more than 200 for 16 days in a row. In the same year in November, AQI was above 200 for 14 consecutive days. In May 2018, the index was more than 200 on eight consecutive days, but had not crossed the mark in October and November.According to the CPCB data, in October and November 2019, the AQI was more than 200 on nine consecutive days and was poor to very poor on six consecutive days, respectively.In October and November 2020, the AQI crossed 200 mark on three and five consecutive days, respectively.Ludhiana witnessed 12 days of poor to very poor air quality in first half of November this year as well as in the corresponding period last year. In November 2019, such number of days was 11.Member secretary of PPCB Krunesh Garg said, “Drop in temperature and lower wind speed have affected the dispersal of pollutants, which is why the AQI is poor. As farm fires are going down, the AQI is expected to improve. Rains and winds can take away air pollutants, improving AQI.”A resident said, “First, because of bursting of crackers and then due to stubble burning the air quality has suffered. The authorities should act sternly to check pollution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/for-1st-time-in-4-yrs-poor-aqi-for-10-consecutive-days-in-a-month/articleshow/87766067.cms||Shariq Majeed

Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana on Tuesday held a crime review meeting with officers to discuss law and order arrangements and other aspects of policing at police headquarters. “The commissioner reiterated the need for optimal utilisation of manpower resources at police station level,” an officer said. While reviewing the merger and integration of PCR with police stations and separation of law and order and investigation duties at the police station level, CP Delhi said efforts put in by all officers have led to over 400 per cent reduction in response time towards distress calls on the 112 helpline. “Weekly offs should be provided to SHOs and other inspectors posted in police stations. For the first time, all police stations of Delhi have been provided with three inspector rank officers (SHO, inspector law and order and inspector investigation) for better supervision,” the commissioner said in the meeting. Senior officers were directed to ensure rigorous tenant verification so that no unverified person takes a house on rent. “There is an urgent need for more thorough impact assessment of crime prevention strategies to make systematic improvements for effective policing,” the police chief said. District DCPs were directed to review all pending crimes-against-women cases and ensure that chargesheets in these cases are filed within the mandated period. According to the police chief, while investigating cases of use of firearms in crime, the teams should also concentrate on getting to the source of ammunition to break the chain of the illicit arms trade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/response-time-to-distress-calls-down-by-400-cops/articleshow/87767808.cms||---

ATS sleuths also seized 24kg more of heroin, worth Rs 120 crore, from Navadra village in Jam-Kalyanpur taluka of Devbhoomi-Dwarka district, its officers said on Wednesday. The development came after ATS had on Sunday arrested three persons — Mukhtar Hussein alias Jabbar Jodiya, a resident of Jodia in Jamnagar, Ghulam Bhagad from Salaya in Devbhoomi-Dwarka, and Shamsuddin Husseinmiya Saiyyed alias Pirzada Bapu, a resident of Jinjuda village in Morbi — for possession of 120kg of heroin, worth Rs 600 crore. Hussein and Bhagad, at the instruction of Hussein’s brother Isa Rav, brought the drugs from a Pakistani drug racketeer, Zahid Bashir Baloch. During the investigation, it was revealed that the accused were active in states such as Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Punjab. Of the consignment of 132kg brought from Pakistan, 12kg was to be given to the aides of jailed sharpshooter Bharatbhusan Sharma alias Bhola Shooter — Ankit Jakhad and Arvind Yadav. The 12kg was to be delivered to the two by a Jamnagar resident, Iqbal Qadri. When Qadri went to deliver the drugs, a team of Gujarat ATS caught him, and Yadav, a resident of Sriganganagar in Rajasthan, from Sirohi district in Rajasthan, said an official statement of the ATS. During questioning, Yadav told cops that Sharma had been running the racket from Faridkot jail where he has been imprisoned in connection with cases of murder, attempted murder and extortion. Sharma’s aide, Jakhad, has been managing the illicit business at his behest, said an ATS officer, adding that both Sharma and Jakhad were close aides of another gangster, Lawrence Bishnoi. The ATS officer also said that they have also detained a wanted accused, Isa Rav’s son, Hussein Rav, in the case. On questioning Mukhtar Hussein, he told cops that one consignment, 24kg, was kept at the house of Anwar Patelia at Navadra village in Jam-Kalyanpur taluka of Devbhoomi-Dwarka district.

---||Goa||Make Goa fully cashless in 3-4 months: Minister Bhagwat Karad to bankers||PANAJI: Five years after former Union defence minister Manohar Parrikar called for Goa to be made the first cashless state in India, minister of state for finance Bhagwat Karad on Wednesday made a similar call, and gave bankers 3-4 months to completely eliminate cash, catching them by surprise. Karad, who chaired a special state-level bankers' committee (SLBC) meeting in Panaji, said that Goa’s robust banking network, high per capita income and high literacy could make the transition to a cashless economy faster. “Goa’s banking position is very good, now we must move ahead and declare Goa as a digital transaction state,” said Karad. “Cash transactions are primarily on petrol and diesel, these people at the pumps have to be trained first. Cash transactions are highest at the fuel pumps, then secondly at the kirana stores (and) vegetable vendors.” Citing his own experience of purchasing groundnuts from a street vendor in Delhi using a mobile payment app, Karad said that people should be able to pay for tea and daily groceries using a digital medium. State Bank of India general manager Sukhvinder Kaur informed Karad that 30% of all payments in Goa are done in cash. “From 30%, we must reduce it to 0%,” shot back Karad. “We have to make digital payments 100%. If we can make the two districts of Goa 100% digital transaction..., we can say that no cash is used in any village,” said Karad. India’s working poor rely almost exclusively on cash, and a majority of the country’s informal sector functions on off-the-books payments. According to data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) earlier this month, there has been a 64% increase in cash in circulation since demonetisation. Currency in circulation increased from Rs 17.7 lakh crore on November 4, 2016, to Rs 29.1 lakh crore on October 29 this year. Bankers also informed Karad that online financial frauds are a “by-product” of the push towards online banking, and that those not digitally savvy could fall prey to fraudulent transactions during the transition towards a cashless system. The doctor-turned-politician also met with chief minister Pramod Sawant, who agreed with the move to make Goa a 100% digital transaction state. Karad and Sawant also said that the state would work to ensure that every resident of the state is covered by the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana. Private and public sector bankers pointed out that poor cellular network penetration hinders digital payments in Goa’s hinterland. “I am from the Centre and here Puneet Kumar Goel (state finance secretary) is from the state government. Erect as many mobile towers as required,” said Karad. “The government must work to ensure that the internet reaches every part of the state.” Karad brought up the issues of internet penetration, digital banking, adoption of Central schemes and credit growth during an interaction with Sawant later in the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/make-goa-fully-cashless-in-3-4-months-jr-fin-min-to-bankers/articleshow/87767823.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand to come up with its own ‘Himalayan’ brand of spices and vegetables||DEHRADUN: While inaugurating the three-day International Spices and Vegetable fest in Rishikesh on Tuesday, agriculture minister Subodh Uniyal announced that Uttarakhand will be branding its own spices and vegetables. “We are pioneers in the cultivation of ginger, red chili, turmeric, cardamom, and garlic. Similarly, we are producing a huge amount of vegetables every year, which are sent out to other countries and states without our brand. We have therefore decided to use the ‘Himalayan’ prefix next to every product of ours. This will give an identity to our products and can also fetch us good prices at international markets,” Uniyal said. Notably, Uttarakhand is among the frontrunners in producing spices, with 6.62 metric tonnes of spices being produced across one hectare of land. Overall, the state produces 96,282 metric tonnes of spices across 14,536 hectares, according to the agriculture department’s 2019-2020 data. The hill state is among the leading producers of seven spices -- turmeric, garlic, chilly, coriander, fenugreek, ginger and black cardamom. HS Baweja, director, Uttarakhand horticulture department, said, “We will have a centre of excellence in Tehri for ginger, another one in Pithoragarh for turmeric, and one for chillies in Salt (Almora). In terms of productivity in spices, Uttarakhand is at the top position in the country. Now, we will help farmers sell their products in a way that gets them more profits.” The fest is being attended by stakeholders from several countries -- like Russia, Australia, America, Singapore and others. While some will attend the event virtually, others have come to Rishikesh for the fest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-to-come-up-with-its-own-himalayan-brand-of-spices-and-vegetables/articleshow/87766106.cms||Shivani Azad

The civic body has warned of punitive action against the dairy farms that violate the norm. Waste from these dairies flows into drains that end up polluting Ganga, according to civic officials. Meanwhile, the municipal corporation also levied penalties on nine dairy farms under the Cow Protection Act for keeping cattle in life-threatening conditions. Several of these establishments were issued a notice regarding poor sanitation earlier as well. At present, more than 50 dairy farms are operational in the jurisdictional limits of Haridwar Municipal Corporation. Dayanand Saraswati, Haridwar municipal commissioner, told TOI, “No dairy activities will be permitted without registration. During inspections on Wednesday, we found that several dairy businesses being run in the Jawalapur region do not keep cattle in hygienic conditions. Therefore, we imposed a penalty on nine dairies in the area and ordered officials to file a case against three dairy owners.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/no-dairy-activities-to-be-permitted-without-registration-of-animals-in-haridwar/articleshow/87766095.cms||MS Nawaz

The price slid by Rs 500 against Tuesday’s Rs 51,100 per 10 gram. According to analysts, gold prices showed a downward trend in the international market and hovered around the $1,860 per ounce mark according to the World Gold Council, after the dollar inched to a 16-month high. The gold price, however, is expected to increase in the days to come over concerns of rising global inflation, suggest industry players. “Gold is usually perceived as a hedge against inflation and amid concerns of global inflation coupled with a consistent depreciation of the Indian rupee against the US dollar, the yellow metal price in the Indian market is expected to go up,” said a city-based bullion trader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gold-price-falls-after-a-weeks-rally/articleshow/87766904.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Prince in a jam amid selfie-hunting horde||Ahmedabad: A viral photo shows a sub-adult lion trapped within a circle of jeeps loaded with people indiscriminatingly shooting photos. Experts have surmised that the picture is not recent as one of the guides spotted in it retired some time ago. However, wildlife activists are furious. They say the forest department claims it has installed GPS trackers in every jeep and has deputed a guide for each vehicle to ensure that the tourist rush doesn’t overwhelm the lions. The activists say if such measures are really in place, the sub-adult lion would not have been swamped by the selfie-crazed horde. Jaidev Dhadhal, a wildlife activist, has tweeted the picture and has written to the principal chief conservator of forests Shyamal Tikadar. Dhadhal wants action against the officers, drivers, and guides responsible for the situation in which the jungle royalty was cornered. Dhadhal stated in his email that it was the responsibility of the officials to ensure that the jeeps move on their allotted routes and avoid detours at all costs. But in this case it appears that many vehicles were on the same route. Bhushan Pandya, another activist, said: “Sukhabhai Dave is seen in the picture. He retired a few months ago.” However, Pandya said, initially only 90 vehicles per day were allowed on eight routes. Now, the vehicle numbers can reach up to 180 per day sometimes. “It seems that the arrangements have not been implemented properly,” said a senior forest department officer in Gandhinagar. “Even if the photograph is old, the fact remains that many vehicles were allowed to be bunched together.” This is sheer negligence on part of the beat guards and those monitoring the movement of vehicles, the officer said. He said the drivers may have also exposed tourists to some danger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/prince-in-a-jam-amid-selfie-hunting-horde/articleshow/87766900.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Covid distress forced Uttar Pradesh parents to shift kids from private to government schools: ASER||LUCKNOW: There has been a clear shift from private schools to government schools in the last three years, with Uttar Pradesh and Kerala reporting a maximum increase in government school enrolment, as per the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), 2021. Preference for government schools, researchers say, stemmed from the financial distress triggered by Covid-19 pandemic. In UP, enrolments in government schools rose by 13.2% percentage points in 2021 as compared to 2018, which was highest in the country, closely followed by Kerala that clocked an increase by 11.9 percentage points. Also, learning material availability to students rose apparently because schools remained shut and kids studied at home through online material. These assessments were released on Wednesday by ASER Centre — a non-profit organization that reports children's school and learning status from time to time. Director, ASER Centre, Wilima Wadhwa released the report online. The survey was conducted in over 76,706 households of 581 districts in 28 states of the country to know the impact of the pandemic and school closures on children’s access to learning opportunities. Around 8,808 households were surveyed in 70 districts of UP. While ASER-2020 was conducted in September 2020, six months into the pandemic, when schools were shut across the country, ASER 2021 was done in September-October, 2021, when schools were beginning to reopen, Wadhwa said. In UP, the study showed that in 2018, the total of 43.1% students (6-14 agegroup) were enrolled in government schools. The number rose to 49.7% in 2020 and 56.3% in 2021. This means, in two years of the Covid-19 pandemic, there was an increase of 13.2 percentage points in enrolment in government schools. "Parents shifted kids to government schools because of financial distress due to the pandemic as many affordable private schools had to be shut down. Besides, migrants moving back to their native places opted for government schools," said Wadhwa. At the same time, the survey found there was an increase in learning material available with students. In 2018, about 79.6% students of private and government schools in UP had textbooks of their respective grades. The number rose to 91.3% this year. More children taking private tuition:The survey also found a steady increase in children taking private tuition as parents wanted supplemental learning support for their wards during the pandemic. UP witnessed a rise of 19.1 percentage points in the number of students joining private tuitions or coaching in comparison to 2018. About 19.6% students were taking tuitions in 2018, which rose to 32.9% in 2020 and 38.7% in 2021. Arunachal Pradesh recorded the highest, 19.6 percentage points increase in students joining tuition/coaching in this period. 34.3% UP kids have no smartphone:The report also revealed that smartphone ownership in houses increased over time, but children's access was still an issue. As many as 34.3% UP students could not access smartphones for learning purpose, despite devices being available at their home due to various reasons. The state is in fourth place after Bihar, West Bengal and Jharkhand where 53.8%, 46.5% and 39.7% of students respectively are unable to use smartphones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/in-up-pandemic-distress-forced-parents-to-move-kids-from-private-to-govt-schools-aser-study/articleshow/87767837.cms||Mohita Tewari
---||Delhi||Dual blow: Sukesh Chandrasekhar’s target was duped by conman’s aides too||NEW DELHI: Not only conman Sukesh Chandrasekhar, but his partners also targeted his victim independently. It was a double whammy for Aditi Singh, the wife of former Ranbaxy promoter Shivinder Singh, sources said while elaborating on how Chandrasekhar’s aides duped her of Rs 7.2 crore on the pretext of transferring Rs 31.5 crore to Dubai. The accused allegedly transferred Rs 24 crore and pocketed the rest as they assumed that she would not approach police for help, the sources added. The chargesheet filed by Delhi Police’s Economic Offences Wing (EOW) in the Rs 200-crore extortion case reveals that Komal Poddar, branch head of RBL Bank at Baba Khadak Singh Marg, was allegedly tasked by Chandrasekhar to receive the money from Singh. Poddar used a web of 18 shell companies, nine of which had Delhi addresses. A probe has revealed that Poddar and two money exchangers — all three have been arrested — routed Rs 24 crore through a hawala agent, Jai Prakash alias Jaggi. Of this siphoned amount, Enforcement Directorate has recovered Rs 82 lakh in cash and gold worth Rs 95 lakh from Poddar’s house. The chargesheet also details the role of a Karol Bagh-based hawala dealer, Avtar Singh alias Dolly Kochar, who allegedly laundered Rs 120-130 crore between June 2020 and July 2021. Avtar was a contact of the Ramnani brothers who were reportedly handling the cash flow between the victim and Chandrasekhar. Avtar was funnelling the money to different cities in India and abroad for a 7% commission and is estimated to have earned Rs 8-10 crore, the chargesheet says. Delhi Police busted the racket in the first week of August and its Special Cell arrested Deepak Ramnani and his brother Pradeep, which led to a raid at Rohini jail and the arrest of Chandrasekhar. The case was then transferred to EOW. Subsequently, Chandrasekhar’s wife, Leena Maria Paul, seven jail officials and Avtar were also arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dual-blow-sukeshs-target-was-duped-by-conmans-aides-too/articleshow/87767843.cms||Raj Shekhar

Taking cognisance of the situation, higher education minister Dhan Singh Rawat has ordered officials to increase the number of seats in the colleges and make sure that no deserving student is left out. The minister asked the department to look into the possibility of holding evening classes to accommodate all students. Notably, exams were cancelled due to the pandemic and students were graded on internal assessment, resulting in more students scoring higher than usual. The pass percentage for Class XII (Uttarakhand Board of School Education) was 99.56% this year as against 80.26% last year.  Meanwhile, the department officials have also been asked to fill the vacant posts in the colleges and hold the convocation ceremonies of all state government-run universities by the end of the year. The department is also planning to provide DigiLocker services -- a cloud-based facility to store documents online -- to all college students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/with-students-having-scored-higher-than-usual-in-last-boards-ukhand-govt-degree-colleges-in-a-fix-over-offering-admissions/articleshow/87766121.cms||Mohammad Anab

---||Kolkata||Stop fighting over jurisdiction: West Bengal CM to cops||MADHYAMGRAM: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday asked Kolkata Police and Bidhannagar Police to stop fighting over jurisdiction and see that people don’t suffer. She said this in Madhyamgram while speaking about the spate of accidents at Chingrighata crossing on EM Bypass. “I have instances of some accidents that shouldn’t have happened. Kolkata Police keeps saying that the Chingrighata crossing does not fall under its jurisdiction. Bidhannagar Police, too, says the same. The bottom line is that people are suffering. We will be setting up a foot over bridge there but the problem has to be sorted out. I have been saying this since Gyanwant (Gyanwant Singh IPS) was the police commissioner,” the CM said at an administrative meeting in Madhyamgram. Banerjee also asked whether IPS officers, before handing over charge to their successors, were passing on “notes” to them so that the new officers can understand the problems and administrative plans in the area. Soon after the CM’s meeting, acting DGP Manoj Malviya visited Chingrighata crossing along with Bidhannagar Police commissioner Supratim Sarkar and Kolkata Police's joint CP (Traffic) Santosh Pandey. “It was decided that the deployment of cops would be increased. While Kolkata Police will increase the number of cops from 12 to 15 during peak hours, Bidhannagar Police will also double the number of cops on the Nicco Park stretch,” sources said. The entire stretch between Metropolitan and Hyatt has witnessed seven fatal accidents so far since 2019. The Bidhannagar stretch (up to Nicco Park) has witnessed three deaths in the same period. The CM also touched upon the issue of waterlogging in several pockets of Rajarjhat, Salt Lake and Dum Dum. The CM advised local MLAs and Bidhannagar mayor Krishna Chakraborty to take up the matter with the Airports Authority of India (AAI). “Water from the airport runway is flowing into the canals during heavy rain. You should take up the matter with the AAI and come up with a design to sort out the problem,” she said. The CM asked PWD (Roads) to take immediate steps and clear the soil dumped on the side of roads choking the flow of water in some Barrackpore wards. Trinamool Barrackpore MLA Raj Chakraborty told in the meeting that the problem was acute in Ghoshpara, Lalkuthi following the extension work of the Kalyani Expressway. “PWD to hele dule chole, or naam holo hel dol department,” the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/stop-fighting-over-jurisdiction-cm-to-cops/articleshow/87766915.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

As per data on CoWin portal, 4.04 crore people in the state have taken both doses, constituting over 26% of the total eligible population of 15.04 crore. UP now has maximum number of fully vaccinated people in the country. Also, every tenth person to be immunised against coronavirus in the country is from Uttar Pradesh. The total number of fully vaccinated people in the country is over 38 crore. Data from CoWin portal also shows that Maharashtra, despite being closest to UP in terms of vaccination, is behind UP by over 50 lakh in the count of fully vaccinated. Officials said UP is already number one in terms of total doses administered and partially vaccinated population. According to officials, the credit for steady rise in vaccination in UP goes to the hard work put in by field workers, effective strategy to cover every eligible person, mitigate myths, eliminate digital divide and powerful communication and reinforcement strategy. The government has also rolled out ‘Har Ghar Dastak Abhiyan’ in which those due for vaccine dose are being contacted individually. Health officials urged people to adhere to Covid-19 prevention protocol despite vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/every-10th-fully-vaccinatedperson-in-country-is-from-up/articleshow/87767840.cms||Shailvee Sharda

A delegation of Congress leaders, MLAs and workers met state DGP Ashish Bhatia and submitted a memorandum,which stated that installing a bust of the man who murdered Gandhi was an attempt to attack the country’s integrity and was like an act of terrorism. “In the interest of the country’s integrity, request you to take action against the people behind this under sedition law,” the memorandum read. A group of people from a right-wing outfit, Hindu Sena, had on Monday installed the bust, which some Congress members demolished on Tuesday. Police arrested seven persons from both sides on charges of promoting enmity. “It is a matter of shame that such a thing is happening in the Gujarat of Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel. Gandhi is celebrated for non-violence, and dedicated his entire life to fight for the country’s freedom,” Congress leader Bharatsinh Solanki told reporters after meeting the DGP. “People who are behind this despicable act of installing the bust of the murderer of Mahatma Gandhi should be booked under sedition law, because this is an anti-national act. This is what we have demanded from the DGP,” he said. Godse’s bust was installed by members of the Hindu Sena, a right-wing outfit led by Jamnagar-based lawyer Pratik Bhatt, in an open ground of a small temple-cum-ashram on Jamnagar city outskirts, said inspector of Jamnagar ‘A’ division police station, Mahavir Jalu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cong-wants-sedition-charges-for-godse-bust-installation/articleshow/87766917.cms||---

Officials have claimed that this move will help check suspicious activities as a lot of public dealings take place in the Zone A office. The MC has also decided to convert an abandoned area near the office into a green park, where benches could be installed for the benefit of the general public. The main building is also being revamped, with beautiful graffiti being painted on the walls.Officials say that the cameras will help keep an eye on the public movement as in the past, several complaints were received about touts asking for money from visitors. The control of cameras will remain in the office of zonal commissioner.An old fountain inside the complex will also be removed as it has became a breeding ground for mosquitoes, officials said. Meanwhile, Jasjit Singh, a visitor to zone A office, said, “The CCTVs are must these days as at least senior officials can check what the junior staff is doing. However, the rush at the Suvidha center and other issues must be resolved too.” He said that there is a need reform the MC office so that the public does not face any harassment. Zonal Commissioner JS Sekhon said, “The CCTVs are must, especially where there is public dealing. I can check from my office if any resident is troubled in the Suvidha centre or anywhere else in the building. The entire office is under renovation.” He said the MC is responsible for cleanliness in the city, but if its own office is dirty, then it sends out a wrong message.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/cctvs-installed-at-mc-office-to-keep-an-eye-on-touts/articleshow/87766133.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The notices have come as a shocker to the striking MSRTC workers who, however, said they will not give up their protest. Union sources indicated that the protest will continue at least till November 22, when the matter comes up for hearing in Bombay high court. In an incident near Pune, a fight between a conductor operating an MSRTC bus and a bus controller who was on strike turned ugly, with the latter getting injured in the eye and admitted to hospital on Wednesday. Sources said the conductor, attached to Satara bus depot, was in a Shivshahi bus to Pune when some workers on strike objected. The sources said that a bus controller, who was also on strike, argued with the conductor, which led to the fight and he got injured. A BJP delegation led by MLA Gopichand Padalkar met governor B S Koshyari seeking his intervention in the issue. Padalkar said, “As head of state we requested the governor to issue orders to the state government to take steps to end the impasse. The state government is not interested in talking to striking employees, they are only taking coercive action, threatening employees.” He claimed that so far 36 employees have died by suicide. “A case of culpable homicide should be registered against transport minister Anil Parab for deaths of ST employees,” said leader of the Opposition in the legislative council, Pravin Darekar who visited Azad Maidan on Wednesday. On Wednesday, despite the strike, the number of buses operated by MSRTC (during strike period) for the first time crossed the 100-mark. The bus corporation operated 103 buses on 21 routes and ferried 2,756 passengers, officials said. Of this, nearly 400 passengers were those availing of ST buses from Mumbai. Till Wednesday, 7,400 employees returned to work with an assurance from the transport minister and MSRTC chairman Anil Parab that they will get police protection; 84,866 workers continued the strike and union sources said the protest could continue at least till Monday, when the hearing will come up in Bombay high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-msrtc-to-terminate-more-than-2k-staff/articleshow/87768570.cms||Somit Sen

On October 30, the former Ayodhya SSP Ashish Tiwari, constable Anil Rawat and the banker’s former fiancé, Vivek Gupta, were booked for abetment to suicide. Now, the probe angle has turned on its head with police zeroing in on a Faizabad businessman, who had called or engineered calls to the woman banker impersonating as the IPS officer. The deceased banker’s scooter too was found parked in his business premises and police sources confirmed he drove her to her apartment on the night she committed suicide. Sources said, the deceased banker had good relations with businessman and his family and was a frequent visitor to their home. He could now be charged as the main accused, police sources said. Call detail records of Constable Anil Rawat were also found to be clean and the banker’s former fiancé, Vivek Gupta, also had not called her in a year. Gupta was scheduled to marry the banker, but the engagement was cancelled in April last year after she raised questions on his character. Shraddha Gupta, who was deputy branch manager of PNB’s Sahabganj branch in Faizabad, was found hanging from a noose in her rented apartment opposite the bank's branch. She hailed from Rajajipuram locality of Lucknow and her father, Rajkumar Gupta, had lodged an FIR at Faizabad Kotwali police station after she was found dead.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pnb-woman-bankers-suicide-cops-zero-in-on-bizman-who-impersonated-as-ips-officer-to-make-calls/articleshow/87767845.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

According to the businessmen, the rates of ingot have dipped by Rs 6,000 per tonne and that of pig iron by Rs 2,000 per tonne, but the rates of scrap, which is an essential raw material for ingot and in finished products like sewing machine and cycle parts, have not gone down. In another problem for them, the customers, whose orders were under process, have started asking for discounts, citing decrease in rates of raw material.Jagbir Singh Sokhi, president of Sewing Machine Technology Park Cluster, said, “During the past about four days, the rate of ingot crashed from Rs 49,000 to Rs 43,000 per tonne, but rate of scrap, which is linked to ingot rates and is about Rs 5,000 to Rs 6,000 per tonne cheaper than ingot, has not decreased. It is still quoted on the same scale as that of ingot. This situation has given a shock to local manufacturers of ingot because scrap is the main component for making it and when it is available at the same rate (as that of ingot), then why will manufacturers run their factories and incur losses.”According to Kulwant Singh, general secretary of the Sewing Machine Development Club, “There has been a decrease of Rs 2,000 per tonne in the rates of pig iron recently and it is now available for about Rs 42,000 per tonne. But the rate of scrap, which is an essential raw material for making sewing machine and bicycle parts and casting components of different types, has not dipped. Same is the case with the rates of chemicals and other metals and labour. We are in a fix due to this situation, as after coming to know about the decrease in rates of pig iron, our customers have started asking us to decrease the selling price of older orders that are under process.”According to Rajkumar Singla, president of Fasteners’ Suppliers’ Association of Ludhiana, “Earlier we were in trouble due to high rates of raw materials of different types, but now the decrease in prices of a few of them has increased our woes. So as of now we are neither purchasing any raw material nor taking any orders until rates of all the connected components also decrease.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/ingot-prices-down-no-change-in-scrap-rates-has-bizmen-in-a-fix/articleshow/87766141.cms||Mohit Behl

While the sky was partly cloudy because of moisture incursion following change in the wind pattern, the spike in air pollution led to the formation of haze. The maximum and minimum temperatures were 27.8 degrees Celsius and 12.5 degrees Celsius, respectively, both a degree below normal. The visibility dropped to below 500 metres in some parts of the city towards the evening as the density of the haze increased during the day. State Met director JP Gupta explained that a low pressure area has formed over the Arabian Sea. As a result, moisture laden easterly winds are dominating the state skies, he added. Possibility of rainfall is less, but similar conditions are expected to prevail till Friday, he said. Experts said that increase in the moisture content in the area made conditions conducive to formation of haze. It was helped by low wind speed as well. “Tiny particles combine with mini-air droplets and hang in the atmosphere for a longer period, resulting in haze. When wind speed is higher, it blows away the pollutants,” they added, while suggesting people take anti-air pollution measures. This is the second time this month, when the city was enveloped by the haze.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/haze-sheet-hangs-over-city-during-day/articleshow/87767847.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The VIP Road-bound flank of the flyover will remain open for motorists to move towards VIP Road from Bypass.

Sources said that the HRBC is likely to submit their final proposal in next 10 days while a final decision on the temporary shutdown of the flyovers — ranging from two days and a half to over a week — will be taken after November 27. Ahead of the Christmas season, Lalbazar has proposed to HRBC that no major flyover of the city be shut for the entire day. Cops have suggested that the key flyovers like the AJC Bose Road flyover can be shut for eight hours each night to allow HRBC to check their conditions. Sources said that the work on the AJC Bose Road flyover would be taken up last due to the complications. “It seems that either Park Street flyover or Kidderpore flyover will be shut first for two days and a half next month if Lalbazar gives the seal of approval on the proposal,” sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ultadanga-flyover-to-be-shut-for-4-days/articleshow/87766960.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||India||Violence plotted not just for one city but entire Maharashtra: Minister||AMRAVATI: The November 12-13 violence was planned in advance not just for Amravati city, but for entire Maharashtra, district guardian minister Yashomati Thakur claimed on Wednesday, as BJP MLC Pravin Pote and former minister Jagdish Gupta, accused in the violence case, surrendered before police. Citing a report by Maharashtra Cyber, the nodal agency for cyber security and investigation, Thakur said violence broke out in Amravati on last Friday and Saturday. During these two days, a large misinformation campaign was unleashed on social media using #AmravatiViolence. “This shows that hardline groups from both the sides were involved in fomenting trouble,” said Thakur. On November 12, stone-pelting was witnessed in Amravati, Nanded, Malegaon and some other cities in Maharashtra during rallies taken out by Muslim organisations in protest against purported communal violence in Tripura. On November 13, a mob hurled stones at shops in Amravati’s Rajkamal Chowk and Muslim-dominated Namuna area during a bandh called by BJP, prompting police to impose a four-day curfew. According to Maharashtra Cyber report, 4,000 tweets were posted in a matter of just a few minutes. Videos, photos and messages of purported violence were shared through social media, which led to a law and order problem, said Thakur, who is Congress minister for women and child development in the MVA government. “People know who benefits from the polarisation that occurs after this kind of riots. Seeing this opportunity, these people have done all this,” alleged Thakur. Meanwhile, Maharashtra Cyber has identified at least 25 objectionable posts on Twitter, six on Facebook and five on Instagram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/violence-plotted-not-just-for-one-city-but-entire-maharashtra-minister/articleshow/87768827.cms||---

Considering a petition by SJR Kumar against Travancore Devaswom Board, which manages the hilltop shrine, a division bench of Justice Anil K Narendran and Justice PG Ajith Kumar has sought a report from the Sabarimala special commissioner. As per the plea, the petitioner is the general convenor of Sabarimala Karma Samithi, an organization that aims to protect the customs and traditions of the temple. It is alleged by the petitioner that using ‘satwik’ or pure materials for preparing ‘Nivedyam’ is an age-old practice and is highly necessary to maintain the customary practices and beliefs at the temple. Further, the petitioner contends that use of spoiled materials would create health hazards to devotees. Also, using halal-certified jaggery that is prepared as per the religious practices of another religion at the temple and using it in the offering to the deity amounts to violation of religious customs and rituals of the temple. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-seeks-report-on-use-of-halal-jaggery/articleshow/87766992.cms||---

The chief minister urged the central government to formulate policies to strengthen the states. Gehlot was addressing a public assembly at Jorwarpura village in Pipalda of Kota on Wednesday. He was accompanied by PCC chief Govind Singh Dotasara. They inspected the “Prashshan Gaon Ke Sangh” camp held at the gram panchayat. At least 22 departments of state government set up their counters at the camp to sort out various revenue, land, pension, water, electricity connection-related issues of the people. The chief minister reviewed the work at every counter and interacted with people. The CM handed a wheelchair to a specially-abled woman, Manjubai, of Jorawarpura village, and explained to her the utility of the wheelchair. "Due to Centre’s faulty policies, the prices are rising and it has never happened earlier. Petrol and diesel prices continued to rise day-by-day and crossed the Rs-100 mark and are now at Rs 113 -115," Gehlot said. "When the Centre reduces the fuel prices, it affects the state’s revenue that automatically comes down," he pointed out. CM Gehlot termed the Prashashan Gaon Ke Sangh camp a great success in reliving public grievances. At least 5,941 camps have been organised so far in 352 panchayats and over 6.09 lakh cases of mutation, 5.60 lakh cases of record correction, over 4,900 cases of residential land allotment, 6.55 lakh cases of various certificates, 70,000 cases of social security pension and over 31,300 cases of dispute over ways have been sorted out in the ongoing camps, he claimed. Later in the day, Gehlot visited another Prashashan Gaon Ke Sang camp at Thikerda village of Hindoli Panchyat Samiti in Bundi district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/centres-faulty-policies-leading-to-price-hike-gehlot/articleshow/87767889.cms||---

Rukshar Jahan, a resident of Gopalganj in Bihar, was a BA student and lived in the university’s hostel. She was rushed to King George’s Medical University’s trauma centre by her classmates and a university’s pharmacist, where she was declared brought dead. The incident sent a wave of anger and sorrow in the campus. Scores of students took to streets and blocked the road outside the campus demanding justice for Jahan. Many among them, who were friends and classmates of Jahan, were in tears. Heavy police were rushed to the spot and senior officers tried to pacify students. Later, the university lodged an FIR against the driver. DSMNRU issued a university closure order for November 17 and 18 in view of the incident. An inconsolable Ananya (name changed), Jahan’s classmate and friend, who is speech and hearing impaired, narrated the entire incident through sign language before media persons. Ananya said that she and Jahan were waiting near the university’s limb centre to board the university bus for the main campus to submit their scholarship forms. The bus was parked at some distance and all of sudden the driver made it turn backward at high speed, crushing Jahan under the wheels, she added while requesting not to be named out of fear of disciplinary action. Similarly, another eyewitness, pleading anonymity, recalled that Jahan’s head was crushed and she started bleeding profusely. Though there was no movement in her body, students and university staff rushed her to the hospital where it was confirmed that she was no more with us, she added before breaking down. “Jahan was an intelligent student who had scored over 80 % in class X and 70 % in class XII. Her disability was never an obstacle, even in the first semester in the university where she performed well in all three subjects - Hindi, history and political science – of her course,” said a senior faculty member, who taught Jahan. She was among four siblings in the family and her father is a shopkeeper, she added. Students claimed that university authorities are also responsible because there were not adequate arrangements or facilities on the campus to deal with such emergency situations.

Sources said the Railway Board would issue an order soon in this regard. Currently, only tea or coffee, snacks and ready-to-eat packaged food, such as noodles, rajma-chawal and soup, are available on long-distance trains. By the end of this month, passengers are likely to be served their favourite dishes in trains like pre-Covid times. A railway official said, “Now that Covid cases are on the decline, there is a growing demand from passengers for regular meals.” Before Durga Puja, IRCTC had opened its food plazas at Howrah, Sealdah, Asansol, Durgapur and New Jalpaiguri stations. Asked whether the on-board catering services and other amenities for passengers are set to resume, officials in IRCTC, Eastern Zone, were tight-lipped. IRCTC (east) group general manager, Debashis Chandra, said, “As soon as we get the communication from the higher authorities, we shall make an announcement.” But sources said that IRCTC — the Indian Railways’ subsidiary that provides services like ticketing and tourism — has already started making preparations to restore its services, which were suspended due to the pandemic. The Railway Board is also likely to take a decision on providing bedrolls and blankets. Since March 2020, Railways had stopped the catering business due to the pandemic and incurred losses of more than Rs 1crore, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cooked-food-to-be-back-on-trains-by-end-of-month/articleshow/87766984.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

Covid cases show sharp spike in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: In the 24 hours ending at 5pm on Wednesday, Gujarat recorded 54 new positive cases – the highest in 131 days. The last time the state had seen the cases above 50 was on July 10 at 53. Moreover, with discharge of 16 patients, the state added 38 positive cases, a rise of 15% in a day which is one of the highest in the recent past for the state. Now the active cases stand at 291, the highest since July 27 or 114 days. The worrisome trend of Ahmedabad contributing half of the state’s daily positive cases continued with the city accounting for 28 or 51% of the cases. So how does the trend measure up to the post-Diwali first wave in 2020? The analysis reveals that after two weeks (14 days) of the Diwali day, last year the rise compared to Diwali day was 42% - from 1,124 to 1,598. In 2021, however, the number has shot up by 86% from 29 to 54. Another difference shown is the distribution of daily positive cases.

The last time the state had seen the cases above 50 was on July 10 at 53. Moreover, with discharge of 16 patients, the state added 38 positive cases, a rise of 15% in a day which is one of the highest in the recent past for the state. Now the active cases stand at 291, the highest since July 27 or 114 days. The worrisome trend of Ahmedabad contributing half of the state’s daily positive cases continued with the city accounting for 28 or 51% of the cases. So how does the trend measure up to the post-Diwali first wave in 2020? The analysis reveals that after two weeks (14 days) of the Diwali day, last year the rise compared to Diwali day was 42% - from 1,124 to 1,598. In 2021, however, the number has shot up by 86% from 29 to 54. Another difference shown is the distribution of daily positive cases.

The 53-year-old seer fell back on a chair with his voice fading, which shocked thousands of his followers who were witness to it. The incident occurred on November 6, but came to light later, after a video of the same started doing the rounds on social media. The event was organised to mark his birthday. He was talking about how birth is accidental and death is mandatory for every living creature in this universe, and how one can overcome mental stress through spirituality, and engaging in daily work with a pious attitude. He took charge of the mutt recently, after getting the blessings of his mentor Guru Mata Neelambika Mataji. He has been actively involved in social work since the age of 26. He had opened an ashram for practising yoga, and ran an orphanage for homeless children. Neelambika Mata said that she is yet to recover from the shock of his passing away in such a manner. “He was fit and had no ailments. However, he appeared a little tired after he took charge of the mutt,” she said. She said that he was loved by God, and hence passed away peacefully. His last rites were performed in the presence of thousands of his followers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/seer-suffers-cardiac-arrest-while-delivering-sermon-dies/articleshow/87765455.cms||---

Over 1.5 lakh students of Classes I- IV have not been attending schools physically since March last year. Senior officials from Nashik education department confirmed to TOI that the state education department is actively considering the idea of resuming physical classes for primary students. The department will approach chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to seek his nod. Ratan Luth, former president of Association of Nashik Schools, an organisation of English-medium schools, said, “Allowing physical classes for the primary section students would be a judicious decision by the state education department.” The zilla parishad and the Nashik Municipal Corporation authorities said that they would not face any issues to start the primary section. They said that ever since the physical classes for senior students began before Diwali there were no hiccups in conducting the sessions. Parents were also eagerly waiting for the schools to start. “It will take at least six months to cover the developmental lag in children with regards to education and psychological health,” said Shweta Gupta, whose child is in class III. The teachers have cautioned parents against jumping to conclusions in case of any case in the school. “After the schools reopened, there have been negligible Covid cases among the students or staff. Schools will follow all protocols and parents should not press the ‘panic’ button,” said Nandalal Dhande, the president of Headmasters’ Association of Private Schools. Nilufer Chavan, the headmistress of Wisdom High, said that the government should now do away with the online classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/demand-grows-for-physical-classes-for-primary-section/articleshow/87765382.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Anand rural police on Wednesday nabbed two for pelting stones on moving vehicles along the Anand stretch of the expressway on November 2. According to cops, the duo had pelted stones on vehicles when they were allegedly in an inebriated state. “It was drunken mischief. They had challenged each other but they had later got scared and ran away from the spot. Our teams nabbed them based on CCTV footage and tip from locals regarding their involvement,” said Anand district superintendent of police Ajit Rajian. The accused identified as Khapil Pasaya (36) and Sanjay Vasava (35) are both residents of Indiranagari near Gopi talkies area of Anand. The duo have told the cops that since they did not have work that day, they had got drunk and later pelted stones on vehicles that were passing by the expressway. The stone pelting had however left many passengers terrified as vehicle movement was at its peak during the festive season. The stone pelting had damaged the windshields of a couple of vehicles. Anand rural police had registered the complaint under section 308 of the IPC for pelting stones on four cars and three trucks near railway overbridge 18 near Samarkha crossroads on the expressway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/2-held-for-stoning-vehicles-on-fast-lane/articleshow/87766327.cms||---

They need not be fluent in European languages to study in Europe, particularly in France. Most of the programmes are taught in English. Studying in overseas countries is much easy with scholarship these days,” he said. “As many as 1,000 French companies are based in India and they look for Indian students who had an experience in France.”The centre, launched on the occasion of International Students' Day, will facilitate networking with overseas institutions to have collaborative students exchange programmes, a university representative said. It will create research opportunities for students and teachers, besides offering diplomas, certificates and short-term courses.ACIE will shine as a centre for students to develop their skills, adapting to multiculturalism and multiple languages and adding values in the direction of research & development and employment opportunities, said chief guest of the event Archana Thakur, joint secretary of the University Grants Commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/avinashilingam-centre-for-intl-edu-inaugurated/articleshow/87766994.cms||---

While chlorination kills most of the bacteria, the concentration should not be more than the permissible limit, as it may lead to other health issues,” he said.Though chlorine level of 3-4ppm is ensured in overhead tanks, by the time water reaches households, the level drops to 0.2ppm, an official of the Sirumugai town panchayat said. “Health inspectors will regularly check the ppm level to ensure that the supplied water is potable,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/superchlorination-drive-launched-by-local-bodies/articleshow/87766996.cms||---

Besides the bigger players like BJP, SP, Congress and BSP, some Nishad leaders have formed their own parties and are aiming to contest seats having a sizable share of Nishad votes. Nirbal Indian Shoshit Hamara Aam Dal (NISHAD) Party and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) are the prominent ones, while another outfit Rashtriya Mahan Gantantra Party (RAMGP) is also aiming to contest the upcoming elections. RAMGP has its presence largely in west UP, unlike the other Nishad-centric parties which are more active in Purvanchal. The party is targeting the votes of Kashyaps and Binds, which are Nishad sub-castes. Bareilly, Badaun, Amroha, Shahjahanpur, Moradabad, Aligarh, Etah, Mainpuri, Firozabad, Bijnor, Mathura, Agra, Pilibhit, Aligarh, Kanpur and Unnao have significant presence of ‘Kashyap’ voters. “There are around 50,000 to 60,000 Kashyap voters in some seats of these districts but we are seeking support of voters from all castes and sections,” said party office-bearer Nishad Veerpal Gehlot. Targeting Vikassheel Insaan Party, he said, “VIP could not get reservation for Nishads in Bihar where it is in power, so how will it do it in UP? Dr Sanjay Nishad got his son elected as BJP MP and is himself a BJP MLC, is there anything else to say?” “RAMGP was registered in 2011, and we contested the 2012 and 2017 assembly elections on our own. In 2017, our talks for alliance with BJP failed at the last moment,” he added. Our party also contested Bihar assembly elections last year and is looking for an alliance with BJP, Congress or SP in UP, if offered a respectable number of seats, or we will go alone, Gehlot said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/battle-for-nishad-votes-intensifiesanother-outfit-ramgp-enters-fray/articleshow/87767893.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Bullet train project: Additional 25% for all consenting land sellers||MUMBAI: With the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project facing resistance from tribals in Palghar district, the National High Speed Rail Corporation Ltd (NHSRCL) has now agreed to pay an additional bonus of 25% to consenting land sellers. So far, only 30 hectares of the 180-hectare private land in the district has been acquired by direct purchase. With most of the protests coming from tribals in Palghar, Dahanu and Talasari, the district administration has now decided to go in for compulsory land acquisition. If land is forcibly taken away, the owners get 25% less than what is fixed by the district committee acquiring land. Collector Dr Manik Gursal last month wrote to the NHSRCL, seeking a 25% consent bonus to consenting parties. “In direct acquisition, land owners got 125% of land cost. In compulsory acquisition, they will now lose 25%. NHSRCL has allowed us to acquire land and pay 100% of the cost,” said Gursal. The first commercial run of the train has been pushed to 2026, due to land acquisition delays. With 75% land acquired in Gujarat, the trial run on a 50km stretch is likely to happen from Surat to Bilimora. The deadline for the trial run was revised to 2023 In Maharashtra, only 33% land acquisition has taken place, and in Palghar district, 27% land has been acquired. The total stretch of the project is 508.17km, of which 155.76km is in Maharashtra. In Palghar district, most of the land spread over the 109.06km belongs to villages that come under the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) (PESA) Act. “As of now, only nine of the 22 villages under PESA are still not willing to give away their land,” said Gursal, adding that 15 hectares of the 20 hectares of government land has been acquired. Sameer Vartak, a Vasai-based activist, said, “The government is silent on the environment assessment report. People having land around the route will not get any compensation but will have to bear with the problems when a high speed train (350km per hour) passes by.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bullet-train-project-addl-25-for-all-consenting-land-sellers-in-mumbai/articleshow/87768587.cms||Sandhya Nair

Six houses with 20 residents in one of the blocks of a residential society at Shreyas Tekra in Navrangpura were brought under micro-containment. The second micro-containment zone consists of eight houses with 18 residents located at Polytechnic in Ambawadi. On November 12, the civic body had brought one block of a residential society in Motera locality of Chandkheda under micro-containment. The block had 20 houses with 76 residents. On November 11, six months after the civic body discontinued the practice of declaring micro-containment zones, AMC put a block of an apartment in Isanpur in micro-containment zone. AMC had discontinued the practice of putting buildings in micro-containment zones in the last week of May. However, the practice has been resumed as Gujarat and Ahmedabad marked an upward trend in Covid cases. House surveillance from today As cases rise, the civic body will begin house-to-house surveillance and screening to detect Covid cases starting from Thursday. “Our teams will visit houses located near where Covid cases have been reported and carry out screening to detect any symptoms of illness,” said a health department official.

Bhagyashree Banayat, SSST CEO said, the trust management has decided that offline darshan passes would be issued to additional 10,000 devotees that have been allowed by the district administration from Wednesday. Both paid and free darshan passes will be issued offline at the centres located outside the temple premises. Banayat, however, said, “I would like to appeal to the devotees visiting the temple from other parts of the state and country to book their darshan passes online so as to avoid inconvenience when they visit Shirdi.”. The SSST has also started allowing senior citizens and pregnant women to visit the temple four days back. “Senior citizens and pregnant women looking to visit the temple should be fully vaccinated and 14 days must have passed since their second shot,” SSST officials added. The SSST management has taken several measures to ensure that Covid appropriate behaviour is followed by the devotees once they enter the temple premises.

The fire and rescue services personnel have retrieved their bodies from the well after six hours of struggle.The Karimangalam police said the incident occurred when L Veeran, of Linga Nagar in Bengaluru, wife Umalakshmi and daughter Sushmitha, were returning home after staying with his sister at her house at Mettur in Salem for two days. Veeran, who was a manager with a private garment unit in Bengaluru, was at the wheel.

---||Coimbatore||DMK aims to capture Kongu land in urban local body polls||COIMBATORE: “Kongu la ini evanukkum illa pangu” (no more share in Kongu land for anyone), screams a wallposter by DMK men on Avinashi Road in the city. ‘Therikka vidalama, ullatchi therthalil’ (shall we rock in local body polls), reads another poster by the ruling partymen in the city. The posters are not the only signs that the DMK is gearing up for the urban local body polls in the state, particularly in the western districts. The party is in no mood to suffer another defeat in Coimbatore, where it lost all the 10 seats in the assembly elections. “We have to win all the 275 wards in the city corporation, municipalities and town panchayats in the district,” electricity minister V Senthil Balaji told the party workers at a meeting on Tuesday. The DMK has started receiving applications from the partymen to contest the polls in Coimbatore, much ahead of other districts. The DMK has been preparing the ground for the urban local body polls in the district for the past few days, debuting Senthil Balaji to hold ‘makkal sabha’ programmes. Balaji has visited 150 places across the district, including all the 100 wards in the city corporation limits, met residents and collected petitions from them. He has assured to meet all their demands. Chief minister M K Stalin is, meanwhile, all set arrive in the district coming Monday (Nov 22) on a two-day visit and unveil new projects. For now, the priority for the DMK clearly seems to be Coimbatore and Salem, the native of opposition leader Edappadi K Palaniswami. If Senthil Balaji has been made incharge of Coimbatore, municipal administration minister K N Nehru, another taskmaster, has been deputed to Salem. Nehru has launched a three-day grievance redressal meeting at places such as Attur, Mettur and VAzhapadi, which are headed for urban local body polls. “All the demands of the people will be fulfilled on a priority basis,’’ he said in Salem. A similar exercise has been launched by the DMK Kanyakumari west district secretary and IT minister T Mano Thangaraj. He has been organizing ‘Theervu Thalam’, an interactive platform, in town panchayats in the district. DMK men in Madurai and Trichy too have started preliminary work. “There is active lobbying for tickets,” said a DMK functionary in Madurai. The leaders are, meanwhile, utilising the rain situation to reach out to residents in urban areas. The ruling partymen in Trichy said the applications were likely to be received from the aspirants in a week. Action in the DMK rivals’ camps appears to be divided. While the BJP has begun poll work in the form of brainstorming sessions to work out a poll strategy, the AIADMK is yet to catch up. The BJP, in fact, was the first to ask cadres to submit applications from November 7, but it had to slow down because of the rain. The BJP has formed urban local body poll panels comprising leaders like Pon Radhakrishnan, L Murugan, C P Radhakrishnan, H Raja and Vanathi Srinivasan. AIADMK men agree that they need to quicken the process and gear up for the polls. The Tamil Nadu State Election Commission, meanwhile, held a meeting in Chennai on Wednesday and discussed preparations for the urban local body polls. At the meeting that was chaired by state election commissioner V Palanikumar, health secretary J Radhakrishnan spoke about Covid precautionary measures to be taken during the polls.

Gandhi, 51, sought quashing of a 2019 summons issued to him by the Girgaon Metropolitan Magistrate in Mumbai and a stay on the proceedings, in the interim. He said, “there is absolutely no truth to the complaint and due to his standing as an elected Member of Parliament, he is exposed to frivolous and vexatious litigations by his political adversaries.” His petition said, “ The instant complaint is a classic example of a frivolous and vexatious litigation, motivated by the sole purpose of furthering one’s own latent political agenda.’’ Justice S K Shinde on Wednesday adjourned it to November 22, at the request of Gandhi’s advocate Kushal Mor. In November 2018, Mahesh Shrishrimal purportedly a member of the BJP, filed a complaint under section 500 of the IPC, said Gandhi, and on July 21, 2021 he received summons dated July 12. He complied by appearing on July 26 through his advocate. Despite the 2019 order, no summons were received till July 2021 and hence was “not aware” of the complaint, the petition said adding, only an “aggrieved person” can set the criminal defamation law in motion and the complainant hasn’t shown he is aggrieved. The complaint is “misconceived, baseless and nothing but to …tarnish the public image of (Gandhi),” the petition said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rahul-gandhi-moves-hc-to-quash-2019-court-summons/articleshow/87768598.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: ‘Agri output dips 20% in 2021 compared to last year’||JAIPUR: A data released by the Rajasthan Khadya Padarth Vyapar Sangh states that there is a 20% fall in the production of agricultural commodities in Rajasthan compared to last year (2020). While there is a 20% fall in the production of bajra, there is a 35% decrease in the production of cotton and 30% in the production of moong. The data analysed by the sangh also states that with the fall in the production of agricultural produce, there will be a rise in the price of items in the market. “The production of bajra will go down from last year’s 39 lakh tonne to 34 lakh tonne this year. Of the total production of bajra, 70 per cent has been damaged this year due to rain. This has led to a difference of Rs 400 in the price of damaged and good quality bajra (Rs 1,600 per quintal for damaged bajra and to Rs 2,000 per quintal for good quality bajra). Compared to last year’s 17 lakh gaanth of cotton, only 13-14 lakh gaanth will be produced this year,” said Babulal Gupta, chairman, Rajasthan Khadya Padarth Vyapar Sangh. “Last year, the production of moong was 14-15 lakh tonne. This year, it will come down to 12 lakh tonne. The production of soyabean has gone down from 8 lakh tonne to 1 lakh tonne. The production has gone down due to heavy rainfall this year,” said Gupta. “The production of groundnuts has remained the same as last year, which is 20 lakh tonne.” “The mandi traders get a direction from this data about the course of doing business in future. The shortage in production will not just impact tax collection at the mandis, but also revenue of the government,” he added. “Moreover, in the Bharatpur belt, the sowing of bajra by the farmers was less compared to last year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/agri-output-dips-20-in-2021-compared-to-last-yr/articleshow/87767919.cms||---

In a memorandum submitted to the ZP administration, Maharashtra Rajya Prathamik Shikshak Sangh has pressed for restarting of schools up to class IV in both rural and urban areas. “While schools for students from class V and above started since October 20, there is a need to resume classroom teaching for students upto class IV. The Covid-19 cases are contained to a large extent and therefore, students from all primary sections should be allowed to attend the classes,” Rajesh Hiwale, spokesperson of the teachers’ association, said. Stating that the virtual learning was proving less effective among primary students, Hiwale said the closure of schools was also hampering their emotional and social growth. Kailwas Gaikwad, Aurangabad district general secretary of Prathamik Shikshak Sangh, another teachers’ body, said the classroom teaching for students upto class IV should begin after the Diwali vacations. “Schools from rural areas are slated to reopen from November 22 and we want the government to take a favourable decision in next few days,” he said. Authorities from the education department of Aurangabad ZP said the official decision on resuming classes upto class IV was expected shortly. “The government is expected to take another review of the Covid situation before taking a final call,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/teachers-bodies-want-primary-schools-to-reopen/articleshow/87765393.cms||---

The committee chairman Devang Dani clarified that the BJP party high command had asked them to completely distance themselves from the campaign in the wake of enrolment drive under the PM Street Vendor's Atma Nirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi) where vendors running egg eateries and many other food items are covered. Devang Dani, chairman of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s (AMC) town planning and estate management committee on Wednesday said that the civic body will only seize or evict those food vendors whose carts are causing major traffic obstructions. “We will only seize carts when it is an absolute necessity. Only those street vendors will be asked to vacate or relocate whose carts are causing major obstructions in traffic,” Dani said. On Monday, November 15, Dani had said, “The standing committee had passed a similar resolution to evict non-vegetarian food carts in 2015 or 2016. However, it was not implemented in spirit. We will begin a sustained operation Tuesday onwards.” A day after, on Tuesday, Dani had said, “The drive is not aimed at only non-vegetarian food carts. We are also evicting vegetarian food carts which are encroaching public roads and creating traffic obstruction. We are taking action under section 232 of GPMC Act 1949 which does not discriminate against vegetarian or non-vegetarian.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/drive-against-non-veg-vegetates/articleshow/87767026.cms||---

The phenomenal growth of the MSME sector has proved to be a game-changer for the state and will play an important role in the upcoming elections, he added. Comparing the loan disbursal to MSMEs during the previous Samajwadi Party government with the current regime, the spokesperson said, “In 2016-17, when SP was in power, 6,35,583 MSMEs were provided loans worth Rs 27,202 crore. In 2020-21, 34,80,596 MSME units have been dispensed loans worth Rs 63,038 crore, while Rs 16,002 crore have been provided to 1,25,408 new MSME units between April 1 and November 10 this year.” About 14% of all MSME units in the country are in UP, and more than 1.5 lakh new units were set up in the state even during Covid times, he added. “More than Rs 3 lakh crores have been invested in Noida and other districts. With the state’s policies generating interest in the MSME sector, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath approved the setting up of MSME parks to bring maximum investment in this sector. The state’s first MSME park is being set up in Sectors 29 and 32 of Yamuna Expressway Development Authority. MSME parks are also being built in Agra, Kanpur, Moradabad, Varanasi, Azamgarh and Gorakhpur,” he said. The MSME sector has been responsible for exports worth more than Rs 1.14 lakh crore for three consecutive years, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/msmes-given-rs-2-4l-cr-inloans-employed-2-cr-people/articleshow/87767917.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Resume in-person teaching for Classes 1-5: Stakeholders||Gandhinagar: School managements, teachers, and other stakeholders told the state government on Wednesday to begin in-person teaching at the earliest for Classes 1 to 5. The government had held a virtual meeting on Wednesday with the stakeholders to explore that possibility. The state education department is expected to take a decision soon on re-opening schools for Classes 1 to 5. Hundreds of students in this segment, especially in rural areas, have been completely cut off from all forms of education for almost two years now. Sources said that in-person schooling for Classes 1 to 5 could begin from the first week of December. “During the pandemic, online education replaced classroom education, but it is clear that 100% learning has not been possible in this format,” M I Joshi, director, primary education, told the meeting’s attendees. “Based on your feedback, we will prepare a report and hand it over to the education minister by Monday.” Narayan Charan Swami, who is connected with educational institutions run by the Swaminarayan sect, said there is a need to reduce the course content for Classes 1 to 5 students. “It is high time that in-person schooling for Classes 1 to 5 students resumes,” he said. “Emphasis should be on developing listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills.” Raja Pathak, a trustee of a private school, said: “Swimming cannot be learnt unless one enters water. Similarly, education cannot be complete without the physical presence of students.” He added: “Online education is here to stay though, and we should harness its potential.” Bhikhabhai Patel of the Shikshak Mahasangh said that the government must not include primary school teachers in non-teaching activities for the next few months. Digvijaysinh Jadeja, the president of Gujarat Rajya Prathmik Shikshak Samiti, said students of Classes 1 to 5 have benefitted the least from online education. “I feel it is high time that in-person education resumes for students of this segment,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/resume-in-person-teaching-for-classes-1-5-stakeholders/articleshow/87767022.cms||---

This comes after there were repeated complaints of faulty electricity billing resulting in consumer dissatisfaction and revenue loss to the UP Power Corporation Limited. UP energy minister Shrikant Sharma said that the audit will be done from divisional to state level. “Day to day monitoring of the billing process is a must for improving the revenue position of UPPCL,” he said. The development comes over a fortnight after the corporation roped in five new billing agencies across the state. Sharma said that the billing related complaints should be resolved within 24 hours. “There should be no laxity on billing related complaints. Under no circumstances will the mistakes made in the past be repeated. Correct bill should be made available every month to the consumers on time,” he said, stressing that accountability should be ensured from the billing agency to the MD of the distribution company concerned. Sharma added that the state government was receiving a large number of complaints about consumers not getting bills on time. As per the readings only 34% of the consumers have been billed. He also pressed on the need of taking maximum benefit of the one-time settlement scheme. The minister said that all the consumers should receive the bills by the 20th of every month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/energy-min-for-daily-audit-of-billing-agencies/articleshow/87767923.cms||---

The youth, Vasal Khan, succumbed to his injuries on Wednesday. After the incident, police lodged a case against five people under Sections 302, 147 and 148 of the Indian Penal Code and detained them for inquiry. Khans remains were handed over to his family after autopsy. Barmer SP Deepak Bhargava said three or four friends of Khan’s thrashed him and left him on the road thinking he was dead. When nearby villagers heard him scream, they informed his family, he said. On being informed, Chauhatan police station SHO Bhuttaram Vishnoi reached the spot and took him to the Barmer Hospital from where he was referred to Deesa, but he succumbed to his injuries during treatment. Chauhatan DSP Narayan Singh Rawlot said prima facie the entire matter was related to a love affair. Khan was in a relationship with a girl in Rabasar village, he said. "It is possible that the four youths, who were relatives of the girl and were also friends with Khan called him to a hamlet and beat him up brutally," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/22-year-old-barmer-youth-beaten-to-death-over-love-affair/articleshow/87767928.cms||---

The video shows Akhilesh standing atop his ‘rath’ and saying: “these people of one particular colour... these chillumjeevis cannot take UP forward.” While Yadav did not specify the colour, Singh said that the former CM’s reference was towards the “saffron color”. The “chillumjeevi” remark was interpreted by the UP BJP chief as being made towards the seers and saints. Singh said that the entire Opposition including SP, Congress and BSP has always insulted the “bhagwa color” and “seers and saints”. “In fact there have been instances of seers being arrested in the SP and Congress regime,” he said, asserting that the opposition leaders have been “disregarding Hindu religion” and “feeling ashamed of being called Hindus”. The state president said that the Opposition had even challenged the existence of Ram, which is why they have been decimated. “Rajnitik kshetra mein sanskaar dena chahiye... sanskaar lena chahiye,” he said. Without taking anyone’s name, Singh said that “the person” did not stand by his father, his uncle and even sidelined senior leaders who helped in the formation of his party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-chief-tweets-akhilesh-video-says-oppn-leaders-always-insulted-bhagwa/articleshow/87767918.cms||---

The woman had also attacked her mother with a stone, fracturing her both legs.An investigation officer identified the accused as S Jothimani, a resident of Vinayagapuram at Saravanampatti. “She had separated from her husband Sivakumar a few years ago and was living with her widowed 75-year-old mother Chinna Ramathal.”The officer said Ramathal had recently approached the revenue divisional officer (RDO) and lodged a complaint against Jothimani, stating her daughter had taken her property documents away forcefully and after that she was not taking care of her properly. “The RDO subsequently launched an inquiry into the issue. Ramathal has a house on a 1,200sqft plot at Neelambur in her name.”Infuriated, Jothimani decided to murder her mother. “She woke up Ramathal on the intervening night of November 12 and 13, and tried to murder her by smothering her with a pillow. Hearing her cry in distress, Jothimani’s daughter Saral and son David went to her rescue. Meanwhile, Jothimani grabbed a boulder from outside the house and put that on her mother’s legs. Saral and David, however, saved her from further attack and rushed her to a private hospital,” the officer said.Ramathal later lodged a complaint with the Saravanampatti police, who registered a case against Jothimani under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code and arrested her on Wednesday. “She was produced before a judicial magistrate the same day and lodged in prison under judicial custody,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/42-year-old-woman-arrested-for-trying-to-murder-septuagenarian-mother/articleshow/87767021.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: ‘Walled City least affected by sinking of land’||AHMEDABAD: The only place in the city which has experienced negligible land subsidence in the past many years is the 610-year-old Unesco world heritage zone of the Walled City.  In fact the Institute of Seismological Research (ISR) study suggests that there has been a rise of 75.59m in groundwater level in this area, thus preventing land subsidence in the zone. Overall, the study suggests that there has been a high subsidence in the southeast and western parts of the city. A moderate subsidence in east-central part and a low subsidence in the Central Zone. A senior Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) official of the engineering department told TOI that land subsidence was never examined during town planning and engineering plans. “It is a matter of research that the number of cave-ins that happen in certain zones may be due to cracks that develop in the civic lines due to gradual subsidence issue in those areas.” Each day, the AMC supplies 1,369 million litres of to roughly 72 lakh citizens. But daily, the municipal corporation receives 1,739 million litres of sewage. The difference indicates that Amdavadis draw 370 million litres of extra water from the ground every day. The ISR study claims that groundwater drawn for drinking purpose is not the only causes of ground subsidence. The land subsidence in southeastern parts of the city also includes a large portion of agricultural fields in Daskroi taluka, while in the adjacent western area near Bopal there are large agricultural fields that also pump water. Clearly, ground subsidence in Ahmedabad is the combined outcome of groundwater extraction for drinking, Industrial and agricultural purposes. “Long-term water uptake results in ground subsidence mainly due to pore pressure reduction in the aquifer system and further due to surface loading by the construction activities in urban areas,” claims the ISR study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/walled-city-least-affected-by-sinking-of-land/articleshow/87767081.cms||Paul John

Executed by Bharat Dynamics Ltd, the project entails setting up a plant to produce propulsion systems for Anti-Tank Guided Missiles in the Jhansi node of UPDIC. The development could potentially mark BJP’s nationalistic pitch in the run-up to state polls early next year. The Light Combat Helicopters that PM will hand over to the IAFThe LCH incorporates advanced technologies and stealth features for effective combat roles. To give a thrust to ‘Atma Nirbhar Bharat’ in the defence sector, the PM will formally hand over indigenously designed and developed equipment to armed forces service chiefs,” a statement from the PMO said. This includes handing over of HAL-designed and developed Light Combat Helicopter to Chief of the Air Staff; drones and UAVs designed and developed by Indian start-ups to Chief of the Army Staff; and DRDO-designed and Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) manufactured advanced electronic warfare suite for naval ships to the chief of naval staff. The LCH incorporates advanced technologies and stealth features for effective combat roles. The deployment of Indian UAVs by IAF is also proof of the growing maturity of the Indian drone industry ecosystem. The Advanced EW suite will be used in different naval ships, including destroyers and frigates. Around 5pm, PM Modi will dedicate multiple initiatives of the defence sector at ‘Rashtra Raksha Samparpan Parv’, which was flagged off by defence minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday. The event will continue till November18 as part of ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’ celebrations. Modi will also launch the NCC Alumni Association to provide a formal platform to enable NCC alumni to reconnect with NCC. A former NCC cadet, Modi will be enrolled as the first member of the association, which is touted to assist in “nationbuilding”. At the same time, Modi will flag off the national programme of simulation training for NCC cadets to scale up simulation training facilities for all the three wings of NCC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pm-to-lay-foundation-of-rs-400cr-defence-corridor-in-jhansi-with-atma-nirbhar-thrust/articleshow/87767938.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Akhilesh Yadav jolted before polls, four SP MLCs defect to BJP||LUCKNOW: Months ahead of assembly polls, BJP received a riveting shot in the arm on Wednesday when four sitting MLCs of the Akhilesh Yadav led Samajwadi Party defected to the saffron camp. The four lawmakers who joined BJP included Narendra Bhati, C P Chand, Ravi Shankar Singh and Rama Niranjan. The defections came amid speculations of a covert coup by BJP to unleash a stunning punch on SP, which has been positioning itself squarely against the ruling party in run-up to the assembly elections. Notably, all four MLCs have their tenure in the upper house till March 7. “Aaj Akhilesh Yadav ko neend nahi aayegi (SP chief Akhilesh Yadav will not be able to sleep today),” said UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh after inducting the four SP MLCs in the party at the state BJP headquarters in Lucknow. Claiming the four lawmakers will strengthen BJP, Singh categorically asked the newly inducted leaders to ensure their supporters at booth and sector levels also join BJP. Bhati, a native of Dadri in Gautam Buddh Nagar, had grabbed eyeballs for opening a front against IAS officer, Durga Sakhti Nagpal, who launched a massive crackdown on the sand mining mafia in GB Nagar during the SP regime. Hailing from the politically influential Gurjar community in west UP, Bhati was elected to the upper house from Bulandshahr local authority quota on a SP ticket in 2016. Nagpal, then SDM of Noida, was suspended by the SP government over an allegation of bulldozing a mosque wall in 2013. The officer, who is currently posted as a deputy secretary in the Union ministry of commerce, was then backed by BJP. The induction of Bhati in BJP gains pertinence in the backdrop of the farmers’ stir against three farm laws impacting parts of NCR and restive west UP. Likewise, CP Chand, is a Dalit from the political backyard of CM Yogi Adityanath, Gorakhpur. Elected from Gorakhpur-Maharajganj local authority quota in 2016, Chand contested 2012 state elections from Chillupar assembly seat on a SP ticket, but lost to Rajesh Tripathi of BSP. His father late Markandey Chand represented the erstwhile Duriapar assembly seat in Gorakhpur in 1980 as INC (U) candidate. In 1989 and 1991, he won as a Janata Dal candidate while in 1996 he won on a BSP ticket. Chand later switched to Lok Jan Shakti Party in 2002 and then to BJP in 2007, but lost on both occasions. Ravi Shankar Singh aka Pappu Bhaiyya, a Thakur, is a native of Ballia and a relative of former PM Chandra Shekhar, whose son Neeraj too had switched to BJP from SP in 2019 and was nominated to Rajya Sabha. Ravi’s defection to BJP gains significance amid hectic political activity in Poorvanchal region, which is being assiduously eyed by various political outfits. Similarly, Rama Niranjan, an OBC, hails from the Bundelkhand region and represents SP in the council from the Jhansi-Jalaun-Lalitpur local authority quota. Her husband, R P Niranjan, president of UP Polytechnic Lecturer Association, too joined BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhilesh-jolted-four-sp-mlcs-defect-to-bjp/articleshow/87767931.cms||Pankaj Shah

A source privy to the development also said that the new terminal will have an updated security in place along with modern equipment to supplement handling of large volumes of cargo more effectively. The terminal will be spread over 1,500 sq m land parcel at the SVPI airport campus. At present, all the international cargo is handled by the Ahmedabad Air Cargo Complex, which is managed by the Gujarat State Export Corporation (GSEC) Limited. Estimates suggest that the SVPI airport handled some 60,749 metric tonne cargo during the financial year 2020-21. Being a manufacturing-heavy state, a range of import-export shipments comprising raw materials to finished goods including pharmaceutical products, chemicals, textiles, agriculture produce, electronics, precious metals, medical devices and related equipment among others, are handled in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/svpi-cargo-terminal-to-start-working-next-week/articleshow/87767056.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Nawab Malik submits additional affidavit in defamation case by Sameer Wankhede’s father||MUMBAI: NCP minister Nawab Malik on Wednesday filed an additional affidavit before the Bombay high court in response to a Rs 1.25 crore defamation suit by Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) zonal director Sameer Wankhede’s father Dhyandev, for an injunction against the minister from posting defamatory statements against him and his family on social media. The matter will come for passing order on interim relief on Thursday. Malik’s latest affidavit includes Sameer’s school admission documents and primary school-leaving certificate, wh-ere he has been mentioned as ‘Muslim’. He also submitted that he has verified the documents with BMC records and the schools where Sameer has studied. Malik has alleged that despite being born a Muslim, Sameer secured a central government job claiming to be from the scheduled caste. Last week, the HC had asked Malik if he took due care while uploading Sameer’s birth certificate that showed interpolation on it. Justice Madhav Jamdar had said: “From day one I have been saying...is this the manner in which a BMC officer will write ‘SAMIR’ (in upper case).” He added that “there are also different handwritings” on the certificate. In his response, Malik had said that he had “reasonably verified” Sameer’s birth certificate and a ‘nikahnama’ of his first marriage. Dhyandev, a retired state excise officer, had told the HC that his son’s original birth certificate may have been submitted in school, and the one produced by Malik has the name Dawood rectified to Dhyandev. He said because of his son-in-law’s arrest, Malik, to hit back at Sameer, made allegations against his family without proof. Dhyandev had annexed 28 documents, including his caste certificate, to show he was always known as Dhyandev and never as Dawood. A statement of his late wife that she was Muslim, married a Hindu and converted was also annexed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-malik-submits-additional-affidavit-in-defamation-case-by-wankhedes-dad/articleshow/87768612.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar
---||Aurangabad||SCR: Special trains to run with regular numbers||Aurangabad: The South Central Railway (SCR) has announced that 76 trains — running as specials and holiday trains during the current pandemic — will be operated with regular numbers. The fares for these trains will now change as per the class of travel and type of train. Railway activists have welcomed the move that, according to them, would lead to marginal drop in fares. “The fares for special trains and holiday special trains were marginally higher. Hence, there was a demand for restoring the fare structure to pre-Covid times in the interest of passengers,” he said. While the SCR authorities did not have information about possible revised fares, railway activists said a drop between 5 and 10% was expected. The 76 trains, which will run with regular numbers, include major trains passing through Marathwada like Aurangabad-Nanded and Nanded-Amritsar. Meanwhile, in order to clear extra rush of passengers, the SCR will run daily special trains between Purna-Adilabad, Parli-Adilabad, Akola-Purna and Akola-Parli. The trains will be started in a phased manner from November 20 to November 23. “All special trains consist of general second class coaches and will have unreserved express fare,” said an official release. Amid relaxed Covid restrictions, there was a strong demand from the passenger community for starting trains on the lines of pre-Covid times.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/scr-special-trains-to-run-with-regular-numbers/articleshow/87765440.cms||---

To make future professionals aware about sustainable dyes, AMA Herbal Group of Companies recently conducted a five-training programme. Experts who delivered lectures in the programme included M Raza (technical director), Sadat Khan, Prabhat Singh, Rahul Ranjan and Mohd Zakir. Co-founder and CEO of AMA Herbal Group, Yawer Ali Shah, said, “The world of textile has shifted to chemical dyes in search of bright colors, low-cost dyeing, and fast production. However, manufacturers never think about the environment. Its continued use has made the textile industry the second largest pollutant in the world. Many efforts to make industry sustainable and eco-friendly are underway.” “Continuing the agenda of promoting and supporting sustainability, AMA Herbal initiated a natural dyeing certificate program. This was the first-of-its-kind programme where industry and university joined hands to teach students about eco-friendly natural dyes,” said vice-president, Sustainable Business Opportunities, Hamza Zaidi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/chemical-dyes-leave-adverseimpact-on-environment-health/articleshow/87767951.cms||---

This rate is more than double the national rate of crime against children in the last five years, which stands at 17%. The analysis is based on the findings of the latest Crime in India (2020) report by NCRB. The total number of crimes against children reported in 2016 in the state stood at 4,034. This increased to 6,580 in 2020. However, when compared to 2019, there's a drop of 10.9% in the total number of cases recorded. Despite strict restrictions during the pandemic, on an average, eight children were reported missing in the state daily. Shedding light on the status of missing children, Soha Moitra, regional director, CRY, said, “Despite stringent restrictions and surveillance to prevent any movement during the lockdown months last year, 3,179 children were reported to have gone missing in the state. More alarmingly, in 82% of such cases, the victims were girls. CRY, through its status report, 'Covid and Missing Childhood' released earlier this year, had raised concern over the grim issue of missing children in the state. The NCRB-2020 report has further substantiated the urgent need to look into the issue.” On an average eight children were reported kidnapped or abducted per day in 2020. According to NCRB data, 2,769 cases of kidnapping and abduction were reported in the state in 2020 and 2,835 children were kidnapped or abducted. However, the figure has decreased compared to the previous year.Also, the percentage of kidnappings and abductions were the highest among all types of crime against children. In all, 42% cases of overall crimes against children reported in 2020 were kidnapping and abduction. The state also reported the highest number of rapes of minors in the country in 2020 revealed the NCRB data. In all 1,279 cases of minor rapes were registered in the state last year, an average of four cases daily. This figure is 19% of the overall crime against children in the state. “The Crime in India report is of special significance since it provides glimpses of the situation of crimes in the country, including child protection during the Covid pandemic. School closures during Covid, mobility restrictions to contain the spread of the pandemic coupled with economic slowdown disproportionately impacted livelihoods and household economic and food security of marginalised families. Therefore, it was highly likely that it contributed to increasing vulnerabilities of children to child labour, marriage, trafficking as well as gender-based violence, especially in states like Rajasthan where crime against children are considerably high,” she said. “Child marriage and labour are issues that represent a complex interplay of socio-economic and cultural practices, and, therefore, despite having legislations against these practices, continue to be under reported. According to NCRB 2020 data, a total of 30 cases of child labour and only 3 of child marriage were reported in Rajasthan which is very less compared to the previous year. In 2019, this figure was 48 and 19, respectively. This may lead to possibilities of these cases being under-reported in the state,” Soha said. “The implementation of various schemes has definitely led to certain progress in addressing crime against children in the state. However, with the pandemic adding more challenges there is a need to adopt innovative strategies,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ajmer/in-5-years-39-increase-in-crime-against-children/articleshow/87769857.cms||---

---||Aurangabad||Marathwada’s active Covid cases drop to 314 in a month||Aurangabad: The number of active Covid-19 cases across eight districts of Marathwada has dropped from 809 to 314 over the past month, as per the official data. Although a declining trend has been observed even during the recent festive season, the health authorities have appealed to the public at large to not lower their guard against Covid-19 and undergo vaccination at the earliest, besides following Covid norms. The official data shows that at present, the Aurangabad district (including municipal limits) has the highest 95 cases, followed by Beed (55), Osmanabad (52), Jalna (36), Parbhani (32), Nanded (24), Latur (15) and Hingoli (5). Dr Pradeep Kulkarni, the Aurangabad district civil surgeon, on Wednesday said, people should realize that the Covid is still present even if the cases have declined. “Many foreign countries are already experiencing multiple waves of Covid-19 and therefore, it is wrong to assume that Covid-19 is over in India.” “The drop in cases can be linked with the vaccination and hence, we need to achieve 100% vaccination of the target population at the earliest,” he said. Kulkarni said parts of Marathwada bordering Ahmednagar are witnessing a relatively higher positivity rate. “Gangapur and Vaijapur talukas bordering with Ahmednagar district have higher positivity rate and aggressive testing is already underway,” he said. The progressive count of the Covid-19 patients in Marathwada since the outbreak in March last year has reached 6.29 lakh by Tuesday. It includes, 6.13 lakh recovered patients and 15,830 deaths. At 2.51%, the mortality rate in Marathwada is slightly higher than the state average of 2.12%. The region has a recovery rate of 97.36%, which is also marginally lower than the state average of 97.64%, according to the official data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/marathwadas-active-covid-cases-drop-to-314-in-a-month/articleshow/87765450.cms||---

Tassaduq has been asked to appear for questioning at the ED’s Delhi office on Thursday. He has been summoned related to some money received by him from a businessman under the scanner of the agency for laundering of ‘proceeds of crime’. His sister and former J&K CM Mehbooba Mufti has been questioned earlier in connection with J&K Bank scam. The ED had seized Rs 28 lakh ‘unexplained’ cash from the premises of a close aide of the former CM, Anjum Fazili. According to sources, the agency had seized evidence related to J&K Bank scam during searches at Fazili’s premises in Srinagar and Delhi in December last year. The probe into the bank revealed irregularities such as sanctioning of large loans without collaterals to entities that had defaulted, and their accounts turned into NPAs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ed-summons-mehboobas-brother-for-questioning-in-delhi-in-laundering-case/articleshow/87768863.cms||---
---||Nashik||Maharashtra govt revokes suspension of doctor held over Ahmednagar hospital fire||NASHIK: The state health department has revoked the suspension of Dr Vishaka Shinde who was arrested along with three staff nurses of the Ahmednagar civil hospital recently. Police had arrested the four after a fire broke out at the Covid-19 intensive care unit of the hospital on November 6, killing some patients admitted there. The acting civil surgeon of Ahmednagar civil hospital, Dr Bhusan Kumar Ramtakke, confirmed that the health department has revoked Dr Shinde’s suspension order. The health department had announced the doctor’s suspension two days after the incident as the officials thought her to be a medical officer working under the health department. But later it came to the fore that she is a postgraduate medical student doing her internship at that hospital. She was not a medical officer of the state health department. Speaking to TOI, Rajendra Shinde, the doctor’s father, who is a retired government school principal, said his daughter has been doing her internship at the civil hospital for the last one year. She is in judicial custody and lodged in prison at Rahuri taluka of Ahmednagar. “Vishaka is pursuing her post-graduation in orthopaedics from Mumbai-based College of Physicians and Surgeons. She cannot be held responsible for the outbreak of the fire. I met her in jail a couple of days back. She is shattered and frustrated by her arrest. She told me her arrest is a blot when she is about to start her medical professional career,” said the father. The father denied police claims that Dr Shinde was not present in the ICU when the fire happened. “My daughter was very much present in the hospital. At the time of the incident, she was in the orthopaedic ward examining patients. On that day, she was also told to examine Covid patients in the ICU. She would have gone to the ICU after the orthopaedic ward. How can my daughter be at two places at the same time?” he asked. Both the IMA and the medical fraternity of the Ahmednagar civil hospital are unhappy with the manner in which Dr Shinde and the three nurses have been arrested, allegedly without properly investigating the entire incident. District superintendent of police Manoj Patil could not be contacted as he is on leave. But senior district police officials reiterated that Dr Shinde and the three staff nurses were supposed to be on duty at the ICU. But they did not react even after the fire broke out to rescue Covid patients. “Our investigations in the case are on. It was the relatives of the patients, braving the thick smoke that had engulfed the ICU, who took the patients out,” claimed the police officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/state-revokes-suspension-of-doc-held-over-hosp-fire/articleshow/87765472.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Dissent brews in Kerala unit of LJD over cabinet berth||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) state unit, led by MV Shreyams Kumar, is heading for a split. A group in the party led by its general secretaries Sheikh P Harris and V Surendran Pillai convened a meeting in Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday and served an ultimatum that state president Shreyams Kumar should resign from the post before November 20. The dissent within the party, which is an ally of the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF), that was brewing since the state assembly elections, has now worsened with representatives of four districts demanding the resignation of its president. They have also claimed the support of its lone MLA KP Mohanan and national leader Varghese George. However, Shreyams Kumar, who is LJD’s lone MP in Rajya Sabha from the state, has refused to budge, claiming that the party will take a call on the dispute. “The rebels will have to face severe consequences. The party will not allow any kind of indiscipline. The rebels have no majority in the party. Out of the 76-member state committee, only nine members attended the rebel meeting,” he said. Shreyams Kumar has convened the party state committee meeting on Saturday in which action against the rebels is likely to be taken. However, the rebels headed by two general secretaries have alleged that it was due to Shreyams Kumar that the party did not get a cabinet berth when all the other constituents in LDF received it. Mohanan was also upset over the fact that the party did not exert pressure for a cabinet berth in the LDF meeting. The dissidents are also unhappy over the corporation and board president posts given to the party. The dissidents are of the view that Shreyams’s insistence on Kalpetta constituency had cost the party a seat in the assembly polls. LJD had contested from three seats — winning from Kuthuparamba, where Mohanan scored the solitary win, while it lost in Kalpetta and Vadakara. However, Shreyams said the party had claimed seven seats in the LDF meeting and Harris was also part of the seat-sharing discussions prior to the polls.  “At no point have I tried to create a rift. Last week, a meeting was held to resolve the issues. But Sheikh P Harris refused to come,” said Shreyams Kumar. The rebels are now planning to meet party supremo Sharad Yadav to demand Shreyams’s ouster from the president’s post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/dissent-brews-in-state-unit-of-ljd-over-cabinet-berth/articleshow/87767105.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Robbery behind Jangpura double murder, say cops||NEW DELHI: Days after two women domestic helpers, who were from Darjeeling, were found murdered in K-Block of Jangpura Extension, five people were arrested for the gruesome killings. Police claimed that dacoity was the main motive and the key conspirator was a former housemaid’s nephew. While cops had earlier said they had seized Rs 90 lakh, including foreign currency, from the accused, on Monday they said nothing had been taken from the house. DCP (Southeast) Esha Pandey said one of the victims, Meena Rai (35), was found lying dead on her bed on the first floor. Her hands and legs were tied with plastic rope. Her mouth was taped and froth was also seen coming out of her mouth. “The second housemaid, Sujaila Gurung (40), was found lying dead in the drawing room on the second floor,” she added. Two teams under the supervision of ACP (operations) Manoj Sinha and ACP (Lajpat Nagar) Jai Narayan led by Aishvir Singh (inspector special staff) and SHO (Hazrat Nizamuddin) Kishore Kumar were formed to probe the case. The cops searched footage of 100-150 CCTV cameras of surrounding areas and noticed the five suspects. Their second clue was another CCTV footage in which the suspects were seen on a motorcycle. After analysing yet another footage, they were able to identify the number of the vehicle, which was registered in the name of Sachit Saxena. Saxena was the nephew of a previous housemaid, who had worked for around two years at the house. He used to come to the house to pick and drop his aunt. He came to know that Rs 30-40 lakh were kept there. During interrogation, he told police that he along with Prashant Basista, Dhananjay, Ramesh and Aniket had committed the double murder and dacoity. The other four accused were nabbed from different parts of the city while trying to flee to other states. Four of them entered the house after scaling the front wall. They then went inside the house from the back door, which was open. After committing the crime, while three of them took an autorickshaw, two went on foot hiding their faces from CCTV cameras. They had parked their bike 2-3 kilometres away. The next day, they came to know that the two women had died, so they decided to leave Delhi for a month. “They had planned to open a business with the looted money,” an officer said. All the accused had studied up to Class XII and had no criminal antecedents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/robbery-behind-jangpura-double-murder-police/articleshow/87767988.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Jaipur gets a new lease of life hosting an international match||JAIPUR: A good vibe and loud cheers all around, and a memorable evening made special by India’s five-wicket win in the opening match of the T20I series against New Zealand at the Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Stadium on Wednesday. A lot of action and nervy moments in the final stages added to the extra spice, making the first-ever T20I to be played in Pink City a great watch. Chasing 165, captain Rohit Sharma's fearless approach at the start and Suryakumar Yadav’s boldness in the middle overs lit up the stadium and provided just the kind of entertainment the capacity crowd had come looking for. Pradeep Solanki, a fan who watched the live action from the south-east stand, came to see the genius of Rohit, but was also happy with the match-winning effort of Suryakumar. “In the middle overs, he ensured the run rate did not go down and was so easily tonking the Kiwi spinners. He made the run chase easy after Rohit gave a flying start to India,” he said. Sameer Sharma, who came to see the match from Udaipur, echoed the same emotions. “Suryakumar’s knock was simply outstanding. All credit to him for the win today,” he said. While most of the spectators could be heard talking about Suryakumar’s slam-bang knock, there were also those who gave credit to Ravichandran Ashwin and Deepak Chahar for playing an important role with the ball. “Offie Ashwin’s fourth over when he took two wickets, including that of Mark Chapman (63 off 50 balls), made a lot of difference. Also, though local boy Deepak proved to be expensive, his last over in which he took Martin Guptill’s (70 off 42 balls) scalp, ensured the visitors could not score in excess of 175,” pointed out Nikhil Purohit. Chapman’s wicket came in the 14th over while Guptill was sent packing in the 18th over. As the spectacular action unfurled, unlike their regular ‘Halla Bol’ chant for Rajasthan Royals, the fans in Jaipur were heard chanting ‘Jeetega bhai jeetega, India jeetega’ for a change. Meanwhile, the city got a new lease of life hosting an international match after eight years, while it was a good start for India as the Dravid-Rohit era kicked off on a winning note.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/at-1st-t20i-in-city-rohit-dravid-era-kicks-off-on-a-winning-note/articleshow/87767976.cms||Mandakini Shalya
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Pani puri seller gets 10 yrs for sexual assault on 2-year-old||Mumbai: Observing that there is no substance in the defence submission that removal of garments was essential to establish sexual intent, a special Pocso court convicted and sentenced a 31-year-old pani puri seller to 10 years rigorous imprisonment for sexual assault on a 2-year-old girl in 2016. The conviction came in the absence of the child’s deposition in court. The court reasoned, “The child was of such tender age that she was incapable of understanding the nature of the act, and she was incapable of being examined in this court as a witness.” The accused used to sell pani puri in front of the child’s house. Among a dozen witnesses, the court relied on statements of the child’s aunt who found her crying with abrasions on her private parts and a neighbour who saw the accused taking the child and returning with her bawling. A doctor said sexual assault could not be ruled out. “All star witnesses examined by prosecution deposed naturally before this court, thereby inspiring confidence of this court. Their testimonies could not be shattered on behalf of the accused. There was no reason at all for them to implicate the accused falsely,” the court said. The court said there is no substance in the defence submission that pointing a finger at a person does not show culpability or that the name of the accused should have been stated by the child. “...a kid would continue to weep, if it is hurt by any person and would merely point its finger, instead of stating the name,” the court said. The court also observed that it is a matter of general child psychology that a child would point its finger at any person who hurts the child. —Rebecca Samervel||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pani-puri-seller-gets-10-yrs-for-sexual-assault-on-2-year-old/articleshow/87768617.cms||---

Chandy raised issues concerning party revamp and the disciplinary action being taken against leaders in state. But, opposition leader VD Satheesan said party revamp cannot be stopped since AICC election process will take a year to complete. “Till then, party cannot be defunct and it needs office-bearers to move on,” he said. Chandy said in Delhi that he had discussions with AICC general secretaries Tariq Anwar and KC Venugopal and apprised them about the issues concerning the state. “I have specific opinion on party revamp, which has been communicated to them. But, I am not ready to disclose that to the media,” he said. Chandy is learnt to have complained that the present leadership is not having discussions on the decisions being taken in party forums. The political affairs committee (PAC), which is the highest decision making body of the party, is not meeting to take decisions. The new leadership has no trust on PAC and hence the high command should intervene in this matter. He alleged that disciplinary actions are being taken against leaders in the name of anti-party activities. He told the AICC president that all actions taken were unilateral and those who flayed the senior leaders in the party were punished. Chandy has urged the party high command to intervene in state’s issues. But, Satheesan made it clear that if senior leaders have grievances or issues, then party leadership is ready to have discussions. “Since we are the leadership, we are not hesitant in having discussions with them. We are ready to sort out issues,” he said. Meanwhile, Chandy said in New Delhi that Tariq Anwar will be reaching state to have more discussions with state leaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/chandy-meets-sonia-raises-party-revamp-state-leadership-issues/articleshow/87767132.cms||---

Chaudhary, who is also the Congress in-charge for Punjab, joined the meeting online as he was in Chandigarh. Dotasra alleged that the works in the revenue department related to the ‘Prashasan Gaon ke Sangh’ campaign were pending as the revenue minister was in Chandigarh. The post of tehsildars is vacant at many places and, during the campaign, the duties of tehsildar were delegated to naib tehsildars, but this has not been done this time, he complained. Chaudhary retorted saying, “If you tell me the work, I will do everything sitting in Chandigarh. Still, if it is necessary, I will come to Jaipur on a charter.” “Do not bully me with the charter,” Dotasra shot back. In the midst of this tussle, CM Ashok Gehlot had to intervene to settle the matter. Agriculture minister Lalchand Kataria and medical and health minister Raghu Sharma also raised the matter of pending works with the revenue department.Kataria said, “Pattas cannot be given in 'gramdani' villages as rules are coming in the way. People of 'gramdani' villages are upset over this issue. If this work is not done now, it will never happen. This bottleneck has not been removed yet though the campaign has started. The rules should have been changed before the campaign started,” he said. Raghu Sharma also joined the issue. He said despite the decision on people displaced by Bisalpur dam, no order has been issued so far. Playing down the incident, Chaudhary said the issues related to the revenue department raised by fellow ministers were valid and there were problems at many places. “It would not be correct to call the discussion a dispute. Only when there is a discussion on shortcomings, will they be corrected. All the pending issues related to revenue will be resolved,” he added. There was a similar clash between urban development and housing minister Shanti Dhariwal and Dotasra in a cabinet meeting in June this year. At that time, the issue was over the state not getting sufficient vaccines from the Centre and the PCC president's suggestion to all ministers to submit a memorandum to the President of India as part of an agitation. This was objected to by Dhariwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ministers-clash-at-cabinet-meeting-chaired-by-gehlot/articleshow/87767995.cms||Joychen Joseph

Winter is still far away for now.” Due to the rainfall, the minimum temperature has again gone up and doctors have advised people to take extra care. Dr Dileep Kanbargi, a general practitioner from Kolhapur, said, “The uneven rise and drop in mercury is making people ill.

Nanded range deputy inspector general of police Nisar Tamboli told TOI: “Three offences and multiple non-cognizable offences have been registered against people putting up posts aimed at spreading disharmony and hatred.” In the past five days, the cyber police of these four districts have got nearly two dozen posts deleted, and according to senior officers, the drive against such messages and posts will continue. As per the data obtained from the police, Nanded cyber police spotted 24 posts that posed a threat to harmony. In all, 22 suspects who had posted these messages were summoned by the cyber police and 17 of the posts were deleted. An official said all these suspects were summoned to the police station, but after it was found that many of them were students, they were made to give a written apology and were let go with a warning. Probe revealed that two posts were posted by a Pune resident and a communication along with the link of the post has been shared with Pune city cyber police for further action. While, Latur cyber police registered three cases at three different police stations against suspects for posting misleading messages. Superintendent of police Nikhil Pingale said, “Our teams are keeping round-the-clock watch on suspects trying to incite violence.” Hingoli superintendent of police Rakesh Kalasagar said two NCs were registered against three suspects. They were issued notices before being released and the posts were deleted. While Parbhani cyber police could trace only one objectionable post, which on the request of the state agencies, was deleted by the social media platform. The cyber police summoned suspect and served him a notice and even issued an ultimatum. In Nanded, four offences have been registered for Friday’s violence, and so far, 67 have been arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/nanded-range-cops-delete-social-media-posts-aimed-at-spreading-hatred/articleshow/87765492.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Pune||More students joined govt schools in Maharashtra, 9% rise since 2018: Survey||PUNE: Fuelled by the uncertainties during the Covid-19 pandemic and online schooling, more students have joined government schools in Maharashtra in three years since 2018. The Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2021, facilitated and released by NGO Pratham on Wednesday, put this rise at over 9%. The enrolment in government schools in rural India crossed 70%, even higher than pre-Covid days. Educators said since schools went online, parents have preferred to enrol their children at the entry-level in government schools closest to their homes which boosted the rise in enrolment. The increase in students turning to public education in rural India, while temporary, was driven by financial distress and migrations, the report said. The report also found that the percentage of students who took tuitions has increased from 2018 to 2021. Currently, almost 20% of enrolled students from all grades took paid tuitions. The percentage was 40% when compared to the all-India level. Opting for tuitions had increased across almost all the states, a natural response to the prolonged school closure, the report said. The study also pointed out that economic disruptions had moved children out of private schools to public schools, but parents accessed tuition classes where they had to pay fees. In three years, 9% rise in students in govt schoolsThe report explained, “This may be due to the fact that tuition classes were a local phenomenon where payment may adjust flexibly and quickly based on demand and supply negotiated between the tutor and the family.” Former director of education Vasant Kalpande said the rise in enrolment in government schools is an effect of Covid-19 and the trend absolutely does not translate into improvement in quality of education. “I do not think this will continue. The parents who migrated back to their native places during Covid-19 have decided to take admission in the nearest possible school which the survey reflects,” he said. On the increase in private tuitions, Kalpande said that Maharashtra’s average is much lower than many other states and the all-India figures. He said the state had always followed this trend in comparison with the other states. Founder and CEO of Leadership for Equity, Madhukar Banuri said the real challenge will also be to look into the absolute numbers once schools reopen completely and account for students too. “The effect of inter-district and inter-state migration will play a role, and there is a serious lack of tracking children once they move out of the school or village. All indicators are pointing to a greater number of children dropping out or being pushed into child marriages. Actual figures from schools will give us a better estimate of the damage caused by Covid-19, in terms of access and equity for learning and well-being of children,” Banuri said. Compared to the all-India numbers, children in tuitions could be lower in Maharashtra, but the increase is not surprising since many need support, especially those in secondary school leading to board examinations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mumbai-in-3-yrs-state-sees-9-rise-in-students-joining-govt-schools/articleshow/87768637.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Delhi||Delhi: DTC hasn’t purchased a new bus since 2010 CWG||NEW DELHI: As the national capital faces an air emergency, Delhi government is trying to hire 1,000 private buses to augment the public transport fleet, which is functioning with reduced capacity due to Covid-19 restrictions. However, the city was facing an acute shortage of buses even before the pandemic. While the city needs at least 11,000 buses according to Delhi government’s own estimate, the fleet of Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) has been depleting over the last decade. The last time large-scale procurement happened was during the 2010 Commonwealth Games when modern low-floor buses were added to DTC’s fleet. TimesViewThe DTC was once the city's spine. The rise and spread of the Metro notwithstanding, it is incredible that the corporation hasn't procured a single bus since 2010. Buses reach where the Metro cannot. The two modes complement each other. Public transport must be boosted in a city where pollution is killing. More CNG buses, both public and private, should be procured.From a high of 6,204 buses in 2010, DTC’s fleet has reduced to 3,762, out of which 2,644 buses were procured from Tata Motors between 2007 and 2010 and are nearing end of life. To tide over the shortage, DTC had to request the State Transport Authority to allow its buses to run for 15 years from the date of registration, instead of 12 years as per JNNURM procurement contract norms. While DTC has been unable to procure buses for nearly a decade primarily on the issue of annual maintenance contracts (AMC), the number engaged through private concessionaires under the Cluster Scheme has gone up. In 2016, when the first odd-even scheme was rolled out, DTC had 4,121 buses, while there were around 1,600 buses operating under the Cluster Scheme. The number of buses under the Cluster Scheme is 3,033 now, taking the total public transport fleet to 6,795, which is higher than the figure a decade ago. However, the population of the city and demand for public transport has also gone up since. “The procurement process of more buses is on track,” transport minister Kailash Gahlot told TOI. “Many depots are also coming up and I’m personally reviewing construction and electrification of depots. Without depots to park buses, the number of buses can’t go up and this has been a bottleneck for us in adding more buses. The government is also constructing multilevel bus depots to tide over the lack of space available to create new ones,” he added. Gahlot said, “The induction of buses and construction and electrification of depots is a priority for us. I’m reviewing the progress every week. A thousand buses would have come if the BJP had not alleged a scam in the procurement process.” LG Anil Baijal had constituted a three-member committee following a complaint by BJP, which examined the tendering process and didn’t find any irregularities. However, it recommended floating fresh tenders for AMCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dtc-hasnt-purchased-a-new-bus-since-2010-cwg/articleshow/87767151.cms||Sidharatha Roy

This, as a result of a representation by NGO Cantonment Vikas Manch following TOI’s campaign covering issues faced by Cantonment residents. “We have addressed the representation to the general secretary of Parliament and urged to add this issue in the agenda for discussion in the upcoming session,” Cantonment Vikas Manch general secretary, S Ravinder, told TOI. “On behalf of the four lakh Cantonment residents, we will mount pressure on MPs from Telangana to raise the issue,” he added. The Winter Session of Parliament is set to commence on November 29 with Lok Sabha MPs from the state expected to raise the issue during discussions. Earlier, Secunderabad Cantonment MLA G Sayanna had raised the issue during the state assembly with opposition Congress also in favour of a merger. According to Venkatesh Goud, member of an RWA in Bolarum, with Centre likely to pass Cantonment Bill, 2020 in the upcoming session, the time is right for Union ministry of defence to make certain modifications in the bills to help civil areas merge with local bodies in order to better avail benefits from central and state government schemes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/scb-merger-demand-may-echo-in-parliament-as-ngo-submits-plea/articleshow/87767766.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Hyderabad||For Pochampally weavers, it’s still a battle for survival||HYDERABAD: On Wednesday morning, it was business as usual at Pochampally village — roughly 45 km from Hyderabad. Though news of it being recognised as one of the best tourism villages by the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO), had trickled in by then, it didn’t seem to add any sense of euphoria among its Ikat sari weavers. Though glad about the honour, most were still, singlemindedly, pushing towards that one goal — to earn 10,000 - 15,000 from weaving seven saris. “Sadly, this award is not going to benefit us in any way. Our lives are not going to change,” said Lakshmi B, who has been taking home 10,000 from seven saris for the last 10 years. She said it takes her about 40 days to complete the work. “It is the dealers, middlemen and our bosses, who have 10 to 15 weavers working for them, who will make the money. We will still be paid part wages,” she said. Her husband, also a weaver, gets 15, 000 for the same job. While the pandemic had pulled down the price of these saris by 2,000 (approx), it has revived now and are being sold for no less than 7,500. Yet, weavers continue to get a paltry sum for their effort, irrespective of how many days they put in. Perhaps that explains their lack of optimism. “Even if this recognition draws more tourists to the village, small weavers like me will continue to get limited orders with very thin margins from shops,” said M Krishna Murthy who has been weaving saris for the past 25 years and has two machines. He added how the trend of duplicate saris — from Maharashtra, Gujarat etc — flooding the market is further denting their business. But not all hope is lost just yet. Some still believe that the newly attained tag will prove to be a blessing bringing new customers who have earlier never heard about Ikat saris. “We are hopeful that more people will come here after hearing about the international tag conferred to Pochampally and our sales will increase,” said Ramesh M, who has been selling Ikat saris, dresses and other items for five years. ‘Want our children to get jobs’Almost all weavers in Pochampally village who TOI met on Wednesday said they will not pass this skill on to their children. Instead, they want them to study and secure a more stable job. “The money earned through hours of weaving is sufficient only for food and clothing. There is no money left even to get our children educated,” said Bala Raju V, who has been weaving for the last seven years. He said he now plans to stop and instead start a grocery store or some other business. Weavers also appealed to the government to provide them with some assistance in return for all laurels their work has brought to the state. They called for subsidies and other benefits that can help them improve their standard of living.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/for-pochampally-weavers-its-still-a-battle-for-survival/articleshow/87767888.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

The Rajkot Information Technology Association (RITA) has moved a proposal to allot six lakh square feet of land for this park on the new ring road. The proposal is expected to get the government nod before the end of the current financial year. The park will be a big shot in the arm for Rajkot’s IT sector which has an annual turnover of Rs 4,000 crore and is growing at almost 30%. The industry had generated tremendous business during the lockdown, insiders informed. RITA has been demanding for the allotment of IT Park for a long time. But RITA officials were not able to move the proposal due to Covid-induced lockdown. Finally, around two months back, a proposal to allot the IT Park to Rajkot was moved to Gujarat informatics limited (GIL), the nodal agency of department of science and technology (DCT) around two months back. Jaydeep Nandani, chairman of RITA, said that all the relevant details have been submitted to the GIL. “Now, the proposal is pending with DCT. We are expecting to have a meeting with the top officials of DCT soon for the final nod,” Nandani said. “We have conducted a survey and our association members have expressed interest in the land around four lakh square metre. Once the Park gets the nod, the IT industry from the entire Saurashtra will move here. So, we have demanded six lakh square feet of land from the government,” Nandani added. RITA officials are around 3,000 units to come up at the park which will generate employment for nearly one lakh people. RITA has demanded a land parcel on the new ring road opposite the smart city of Vajdi Gadh village. The location has around three plots measuring six to eight and sources said that one of it may be allotted for the IT Park. Ronak Raiyani, president of RITA, said that they are in constant touch with government officials. “Looking at the progress, we are expecting the announcement of IT Park in Rajkot in the next three to four months. We have also planned to start a finishing school for new talent coming out from university and an incubation center for startups at the park,” Riyani said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/rajkot-it-park-to-be-a-reality/articleshow/87766180.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

---||Hyderabad||Opportunities galore in gaming, VFX industries||Hyderabad: With consumers displaying a growing appetite for high-definition visual experiences, career opportunities in the gaming, animation and VFX industries are rising at a rapid pace, said experts. Gautam Vohra, VP & business head, telecom & engineering staffing, TeamLease Digital, pointed out that cinema buffs, esports enthusiasts as well as gamers are demanding high-quality productions with engaging visual effects and realistic animation, which in turn are pushing studios to include more animation and VFX shots into films and games. “The demand for talent has increased in various jobs that are related to the gaming and VFX industry. In fact, we are seeing a trend of people considering gaming as a serious career option lately, especially in the area of VR and AI.” Vohra pointed out that the common thread running through VFX, gaming and esports is animation due to which the demand for roles such as 2D/3D animation artist and 3D modeller is on rise. “These industries are expected to witness a hiring growth of 18-22% in the coming months and the salary range for starters would be around Rs 3.5 lakh per year, which can go up to Rs 10 lakh per annum based on experience,” he said. Talking about salary trends in the gaming sector at IndiaJoy 2021, Joseph Cairns, founder and CEO of Adventure Recruitment, a hiring firm specialising in the gaming industry, said that the salary for game developers in the mid-senior or lead level would range from Rs 10-30 lakh per annum whereas the package for tech directors could range from Rs 40 lakh to Rs 1 crore per annum. “Designers are in high demand as there is a shortage in India and they would get paid around Rs 8-25 lakh per annum, whereas for design directors salaries are about Rs 20-50 lakh per year. When it comes to artists, there is a big demand but it is one of the less paid areas,” he said. Even Rajiv Chilaka, founder & MD, Green Gold Studios, makers of popular cartoon Chhota Bheem said, “The demand is high for people with drawing skills who can work on storyboards in the animation industry. So, storyboard artists and visual design artists are in high demand.” Chilaka pointed out that the trend of ‘work from home’ triggered by Covid-19 has opened up opportunities for artists from tier 2-3 centres. In fact, his company too has worked with 80 freelance artists last year. Biren Ghose, country head-Technicolor India pointed out that one of the plus points of VFX industry is that many youth, who have dropped out, can be skilled and brought into the mainstream.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/opportunities-galore-in-gaming-vfx-industries/articleshow/87767783.cms||Swati Rathor
---||Nagpur||On BJP leader’s demand, NMC running vax centre in his lawn’s storeroom||Nagpur: On the demand of BJP leader and former corporator Ramesh Chopde, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has been operating a Covid-19 vaccination centre from a storeroom in the marriage lawn owned by, and also named after, the politician at Awasthi Chowk in West Nagpur for last four months. The politician has displayed banners at the entrance announcing ‘free inoculation’, highlighting the BJP party symbol and pictures of himself and other leaders. This display also goes against the code of conduct in place in the district for MLC elections. Chopde is also sending messages in social media groups every morning for last two days. The messages say Covishield is available free of cost at New Chopde Lawns from 11am onwards and open for all. There is no mention about the NMC or government in the messages, though the centre is being operated by the civic body. Right from staff to doses, syringes, nurses, doctor, computers and all other required materials are facilitated by the NMC. There is no board or banner erected by NMC at the vaccination centre. The only banner is that of Chopde. The storeroom is a makeshift tin-shed facility for storing the materials. Huge quantity of materials used for decorating lawns and hosting functions is stored in the room from where the vaccination centre is operating. As per government’s guidelines, there should be a waiting hall, registration area, followed by another room for vaccination and third one for observation for 30 minutes at the centre after vaccination. None of these facilities are available at the centre. Confirming that the vaccination centre cannot be operated from a storeroom, NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI, “I am not aware of such problems at the centre. I will verify and do the needful.” NMC zonal medical officer Ateequr Raheman Khan said, “We used to run the centre at NMC’s school at Pension Nagar. Beneficiaries and staff faced inconvenience due to high temperature during summer. Corporator Archana Pathak (also from BJP) suggested the lawn. Chopde provided a nice hall with all facilities. Later, citing functions, he shifted the centre to another room.” Chopde said, “People were facing problems at earlier location. Therefore, I asked NMC officials to run the centre from my lawn. I am providing space and materials free of cost. Around 20,000 people benefited. I shifted the centre to another room as number of beneficiaries reduced. NMC can shift centre to another place if the wish to.” Congress corporator Nitish Gwalbanshi alleged, “NMC officials opened centre in BJP leader’s lawn to give him publicity. NMC has five schools nearby. Also, there are few halls and campus of police department, CID, passport office etc in the area. Still, the centre is being run in a storeroom. Chopde and other BJP leaders are publicising that they are running the centre free of cost for the people.” Gwalbanshi also said, “It is a major violation of code of conduct. Still, the collector office and police department are turning a blind eye. The lawn, banner highlighting names, symbol and pictures of BJP and its leaders are right on main road and easily visible to all.” Collector R Vimala said she would ask team of model code of conduct to check. The NMC runs vaccination centres from 10am to 5pm. But this centre starts at 11am and closes at 2pm. The storeroom to keep syringes, AEFI kit etc is open the entire day as workers store, bring outside and again keep back the materials. Another major violation is that Rs10 is being recovered to get print out of Covid-19 certificate at the centre. A poster informing about charges is also placed at the gate of the centre. NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said it was wrong if any charges are being recovered. “I will look into it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/on-bjp-leaders-demand-nmc-running-vax-centre-in-his-lawns-storeroom/articleshow/87767127.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Vadodara||New site to house 2,000 cattle impounded on roads||Vadodara: To make the roads free of cattle, the first site to relocate the bovine animals kept in the city will become functional later this month. Work on the site at Khatamba had started after the state government and BJP decided to ensure that cattle did not stray on city roads. The state government had identified four large tracts of grazing land to relocate the cattle being kept in the city. These were handed over to the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) that was to develop infrastructure there to keep cattle and also make arrangements for cattle herders. Sources in the VMC said that the work on the facility will be spread across one lakh square feet. It will be able to house 2,000 cattle. The facility will allow cattle owners to build their own shades. The VMC will shortly hold meetings with cattle owners in the city and ask them to shift when the facility is ready. After this strict action will be taken if cattle are found on the city roads. Meanwhile, the civic body is also looking to increase the intake capacity of its cattle ponds. The cattle ponds can presently keep around 500 cattle. VMC is looking to increase this to around 750. Sources said that the increase of intake at cattle ponds has been in the pipeline since quite some time now, but the work was not taken up due to Covid-19 and paucity of funds. Funds are now available for the project, sources said. The expansion of the cattle pond to keep impounded cattle will also take place at Khatamba.  It is the only pond where space is available for expansion. Besides the cattle pond, it also has a facility for animal birth control operations of stray dogs. VMC will also be extending the contract of the existing firms that are looking after the upkeep of cattle at three cattle ponds at Lalbaug, Khaswadi and Bhutdi Jhampa. This will be done as the bidding process to identify the new firms is still in process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/new-site-to-house-2000-cattle-impounded-on-roads/articleshow/87766340.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Three months after getting discharged from a hospital, K Gopal, a resident of Keesara developed a peculiar condition and was getting a wheezing sound each time he was breathing in, especially while sleeping.  This condition is generally caused due to cold, asthma, allergies, or more serious conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, most doctors would say, but in Gopal’s case there was something else. He had prolonged coronavirus infection, requiring hospitalisation in an intensive care unit. “When he came to us we carried out further investigations, which revealed that he had tracheal stenosis or narrowing, which required stenting in the region of blockage. The patient was discharged from the hospital and is now leading a normal life without any complication,” Dr Tapaswi Krishna, consultant pulmonologist, Gleneagles Global Hospital in Lakdi-ka-pul said. Experts across Hyderabad said that many recovered Covid-19 patients are developing increase in blood pressure and diabetes levels to obstructions in the respiratory trachea, while some are developing heart ailments. Doctors in both government and corporate sectors are seeing around 10 cases per day in OPD with post-viral hyper reactive airway disease, which presents as asthma with wheezing. “Patients with prolonged endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation support where there is an increased tendency to form tracheal stenosis which is nothing but tracheal narrowing. This is seen a lot more in the second wave as the virulence of the virus is more,” informed Dr R Adityavadan, consultant pulmonologist with SLG hospitals. An expert at the state-run Gandhi Hospital said that increase in hospitalisations and increased severity of the disease has led to prolonged mechanical ventilation and complications. “The treatment is usually more invasive with narrowing of the windpipe, stent placements or surgery,” he added.

They said Muslims account for 18 per cent of population in Telangana but they have a lone representative in the legislative council. “This puts a question mark on the 12 per cent reservations promised...,” said Moulana Sultan Ahmed Naqshbandi. TRS can still accommodate Muslim candidates, said Shabbir Ali and Salmeen bin Sayeed, both local leaders. The last date for finalising names of candidates is November 24.

As TOI toured the village and spoke to locals, it found there are several problems — bad roads and lack of hotels, among other things. Soon after getting off the national highway, one has to travel on a kaccha road for about 11 km to reach Pochampally village. “When one gets to know that a village has been selected as one of the best tourism villages, the least they expect is proper roads to reach the place. I was shocked to see the condition of the road,” said M Raju, a resident of Patancheru who visited Pochampally on Wednesday. He said that the state should immediately repair the roads and take measures to keep monkeys away from the main road. Often referred to as the Silk City of India for the exquisite saris woven through a unique style called Ikat, Pochampally will be given the award by UNWTO on December 2, 2021 in Madrid on the occasion of the 24th session of the UNWTO General Assembly. But even though people visiting the village to buy hand-woven saris, dresses, etc are happy with the quality and price of products, they have one complaint—the non-availability of a decent eatery in the locality. “I heard a lot about Pochampally dresses from my sister-in-law and have come to check out the dresses. I spent more than six hours in the village and was desperately looking for a hotel to eat something. Though I could find an eatery near the police station, the food served there was not good,” said A Alekhya, a resident of Uppal. Apart from Pochampally saris and Telangana tourism park, there are not many attractions in the village. The Vinobha Bhave Mandir, a place where Vinobha Bhave resided during his visit to the village in 1951 and commemorated the Bhoodan Movement, lies in a neglected state. The same is the case with the 101 Darwaja House (a heritage building). Though Ch Vijaya Lakshmi, chairperson, Pochampally village, told TOI that there is a plan to turn the lake opposite Vinobha Bhave Mandir into a mini-tank bund, nothing much has been done on that front so far. There are several temples, including Ayappa Temple, Markandeya Temple, among others, in the village that have potential to attract tourists. “Now that the village is conferred with an international tag, it will undergo a makeover soon — mostly in the next six months. Plans are being drafted to start a boating facility in the lake or mini tank-bund, increase number of guest houses in the tourism park, start a restaurant, and add other embellishments,” said Uppala Srinivas Gupta, chairman, Telangana Tourism adding that a detailed proposal will be sent to chief minister on plans to improve tourism in the village. He added that roads too will be repaired soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/best-tourism-village-still-lacks-roads-hotels/articleshow/87767892.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

The police officials said that the suspects have targeted only the farmers who has received crores as compensation against the acquisition of their lands for the Mumbai-Nagpur Samruddhi super expressway. Nimit Goyal, the superintendent of police said that there have been reports about this Ponzi scheme for quite a while, but a concrete complaint in this regard has recently reached the police. “We want all the victims to come forward and lodge complaints against the suspects running this Ponzi scheme,” said Goyal, while assuring an in-depth probe against the suspects. Santosh Mane, assistant inspector at Bidkin police station said that based on the complaint by a 30-year-old woman, who is victim famer’s wife, two suspects have been booked on the charges of cheating, criminal breach of trust and criminal intimidation. In addition to this, the sections of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (in financial establishments) Act, 1999 has also been invoked against the duo. API Mane said, as per the complaint, the farmer has been duped by the suspected duo to the tune of Rs 10 lakh, on the pretext of returning him Rs 15 lakh within two months. Under this scheme, the investor farmer had been assured a 30% return per month. The police said that the perpetrators of this scheme have targeted only the farmers who have received large sums in compensation against their lands acquired for Samruddhi super expressway. In most of the cases, suspects neither have any registration nor they have been given any receipt against the investments made in the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/cops-register-first-fir-in-30-30-ponzi-scheme/articleshow/87765518.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

His body was later dumped in Kali river and is yet to be traced. An FIR has been registered against the five arrested suspects, including two women, and efforts are on to locate the deceased’s body. Circle officer (Atrauli), SP Singh, told TOI that the incident took place on November 13 in Aligarh’s Kalyanpur village under Godha police jurisdiction according to the complaint lodged by Singh’s brother. He said the suspects have been booked under sections 147 (rioting), 364 (kidnapping) and 342 (wrongful confinement) IPC, adding that section 302 (murder) will be added after the recovery of the body. Talking to TOI, Singh’s elder brother Devendra Singh, said that his brother had left his house in Bulandshahr for Mathura on November 12 but his call details showed that he was in Aligarh. “We received his call the next day (on November 13) around 9pm and he told us that his brother-in-law, Hemant, had locked him inside a room and that he wanted help,” said Devendra, adding that after a few minutes, he again called up, saying that Hemant’s intentions were not good. After a while, his phone was switched off, said the victim’s brother. Police said during questioning, Hemant confessed to have strangled Mukesh to death and also revealed that he had thrown his body into the river.  Hemant told police that he got information that Mukesh had gone to his brother’s house, where his wife stays alone as her husband who works with the CrPF, is in Chhattisgarh. Devendra lost his cool and after seeing him inside the house, he allegedly killed him and sent his brother’s wife to her parent’s house in Madhya Pradesh’s Bhind.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/kin-aide-kill-man-over-suspicion-of-illicit-relationship-in-aligarh/articleshow/87766334.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Delhi||Delhi air pollution: In plans to fight fire with fire, hotspots under focus||NEW DELHI: After the Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and adjoining areas ordered a slew of measures to tackle air pollution, environment minister Gopal Rai on Wednesday said fire tenders would be deployed for sprinkling water at 13 hotspots across the city. The 13 hotspots include Rohini, Dwarka, Okhla Phase-II, Punjabi Bagh, Anand Vihar, Vivek Vihar, Wazirpur, Jahangirpuri, R K Puram, Bawana, Mundka, Narela and Mayapuri. “In addition to the current 372 water tankers operating across Delhi, the fire service’s tenders will be deployed to increase the spraying capacity at the 13 hotspots where the pollution levels are relatively higher,” said Rai. After holding a meeting with different departments, Rai said Delhi government had come up with a 10-point formula to fight pollution at a greater level. The environment department on Wednesday ordered all departments, organisations and corporations to implement the CAQM directions. “The heads of the departments or corporations concerned will closely monitor the whole situation personally on a daily basis and submit an action-taken report every day,” it said. “All Delhi government offices will have 100% work from home. Instructions have been given to police to form a special task force to monitor traffic congestion, curb pollution on the roads and ensure smoother travel. The transport department has provided a list of vehicles older than 10 years running on petrol and 15 years using diesel to Delhi Police to ensure they are kept off the roads,” said the minister. Checking of PUC certificates at petrol pumps would be reinforced to identify and deal with vehicles causing extra pollution. Special teams would act against industries flouting directions and causing pollution. Elaborating on other decisions, Rai said the ban on construction and demolition activities had been extended till November 21. “All schools, colleges, institutes, libraries and training centres will remain closed until further orders. To encourage public transport, 1,000 private CNG buses will be hired. This process will begin on Thursday. We have written to Delhi Disaster Management Authority to issue new directions to enhance the carrying capacity of buses and Delhi Metro trains by permitting standing passengers,” he added. The minister said the “Red Light On, Gaadi Off” campaign had been extended for another 15 days and its second phase would be launched on November 19. Meanwhile, transport minister Kailash Gahlot said that entry of trucks into Delhi, except those carrying essential commodities like raw vegetables, fruits, grains, milk, eggs, etc and tankers carrying petroleum products, was prohibited with immediate effect till November 21 or till further orders. The transport department’s pollution control division issued the order on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-plans-to-fight-fire-with-fire-hotspots-under-focus/articleshow/87767169.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Disha encounter case: Juvenile status of accused not verified, SC panel told||HYDERABAD: Continuing her arguments before the the SCappointed inquiry commission for the second consecutive day, advocate Vasudha Nagaraj has stated that the arrest of the Disha rape and murder case accused was illegal as the arrest memo was not executed in violation of Section 41-B of the CrPC and the juvenile status of three of the accused was not verified by neither police, who arrested them, nor the magistrate, who sent them in judicial remand. Vasudha, who represented independent journalist K Sajaya, referred to the deposition of the then Shadnagar SHO, Sridhar Kumar, before the commission. Sridhar Kumar had arrested the four accused from Jaklair and Gudigandla villages on November 29, 2019. Quoting from the SHO’s deposition, she said, “Sridhar Kumar had answered that he did not remember when he was asked by the commission’s advocate whether he enquired from the accused or their relatives their age?” He made no effort to ascertain the age of the accused. As per the family, the arrest was made between 3am and 5am on November 29, 2019. However, as per the IO, the arrest was made at 5pm on the same day at Shadnagar PS. In his affidavit too, there was no mention of ascertaining the age of the accused at the time of the arrest or of intimating the families. It was also pointed out that no arrest memo or panchnama was executed at the time of the arrest. “We seem to be above Section 41-B (Procedure of arrest and duties of officer making arrest) of the CrPC,” Vasudha stated. The advocate also argued that Farooqnagar tahsildar and executive magistrate J Pandu, who sent the accused in judicial remand, had also not ascertained their age and even additional judicial first class magistrate P Shyam Prasad did not verify the age of the accused, which was a violation of the Juvenile Justice (JJ) Act. While the advocate was referring to the deposition of circle inspector (CI) K Narasimha Reddy about his statement recorded by an NHRC team, commission chairman VS Sirpurkar commented, “The CI practically disowned entire NHRC statement, but he did not mention it in his affidavit when he had a chance and during the deposition before the commission, stated that his advocate said it was not necessary.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/juvenile-status-of-accused-not-verified-sc-panel-told/articleshow/87767164.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Mumbai||CBI questions Maharashtra's plea for SIT on cop postings||MUMBAI: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Wednesday argued that the Maharashtra government’s petition to replace it with a special investigation team (SIT) to probe allegations of deals in police postings and transfers since its former director general of police (DGP) was made director of the agency, is “misconceived” and “utter hypocrisy”. “It is but a guise to not let the investigation continue... and in some ways safeguarding an individual or averting scrutiny,” said Aman Lekhi, additional solicitor general (ASG), in detailed submissions before the Bombay high court to oppose the state’s petition, questioning its “conduct”. The CBI counsel said, “The writ is misconceived... This plea is not even raised by the parties but by the state” which has no right and cannot be entitled to the relief it seeks. The state’s special senior counsel Darius Khambata said the CBI probe is “seeking to demoralize and frighten each policeman”. The state had recently petitioned the HC to seek that a SIT replace CBI probe into an FIR against former home minister Anil Deshmukh and unknown others for allegations of corruption in police postings and transfers and to have a retired judge monitor the probe. The state filed the petition after CBI had issued summons to its chief secretary Sitaram Kunte who was earlier additional CS (home) and state DGP Sanjay Pandey in its probe. Subodh Jaiswal, the current CBI director, was the state DGP from 2019 to December 2020 and headed two police establishment boards that recommend and decide various police postings, Khambata had said, wondering how could the CBI then continue the investigation. Khambata said, “There is nothing that prevents the state from coming to court.” He invoked the principle of ‘parens patriae’ (a doctrine where the state has the standing to bring a suit on behalf of persons legally unable to act), saying every individual policeman cannot be expected to move court. At a hybrid hearing before a bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Sarang Kotwal, Lekhi said, “The state’s invocation of law and claim of interest in fair investigation is an instance of duplicity.” The state government was making a “clear attempt not to proceed with the matter... and deliberately avoiding criminal investigation,” he said, adding, “Responsible parenting means a parent has to pull up a ward...The state as a parent is not supposed to protect a wrongdoer.’’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cbi-questions-state-plea-for-sit-on-cop-postings/articleshow/87768639.cms||Swati Deshpande

On seeing a group of men take away the buffalo tied outside his uncle’s house in a field, Urvesh Singh immediately alerted villagers. This infuriated the accused, who shot dead Urvesh and fled. SP, Kasganj, Botre Rohan Pramod, said, “The body has been sent for post-mortem. Four teams, a surveillance unit and a special operation group led bya circle officer are on the lookout for the armed men.” A resident of Nagla Dumber, Maharaj Singh was sleeping outside his house while his nephew, Urvesh, was asleep in a hut nearby. Around midnight, villagers heard the youth crying for help. By the time they reached the house, the accused opened fire and a bullet hit Urvesh, whose cousin, Govind, said multiple shots were fired when Urvesh flashed the torch light into the accused’s face. Sikandarpur Vaish police station house officer, Jitendra Kumar, said, “On the complaint of the family members of the youth, an FIR has been registered. The accused have been booked under sections 382 (theft) and 302 (murder)” of the IPC.

We will complete it by extending it up to the Bihar border, creating mandis for the products of farmers of east UP to get the best price and generate employment.” ”People are all set to oust this government having faith in bull and bulldozer,” said Akhilesh, who was accompanied by former MLA Shibgatullah Ansari, the elder brother of jailed mafia don and MLA Mukhtar Ansari, on his home turf where many of his illegally earned properties have been bulldozed by the government in the past one and half years. “On the issue of stray cattle, especially bulls, he said, “Many problems for the farmers have remained unresolved as they faced a crisis of even fertilizers.” “By promising to enable people in ‘hawai chappals’ (slippers) to travel in airplanes, this government compelled them to discard their two-wheelers by raising the prices of petrol and diesel,” he said. He alleged, “The youths kept waiting for government jobs and other employment opportunities in the past five years, but this government did not fulfil its promises. All the sections of the society are ready for bringing a change in power in 2022.” Earlier, the chopper of SP chief, who was accompanied by alliance partner Om Prakash Rajbhar of Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) landed near the beginning point of the expressway at Pakhanpura. Amidst loud cheers and sloganeering by charged supporters, Akhilesh boarded his ‘Vijay Rath’ to begin its fourth phase by covering the area up to Lucknow. As a huge motorcade followed his ‘Vijay Rath’, SP supporters in large numbers welcomed the Yatra at various points, including Harikaranpur of Jungipur assembly area and Barachanvar in Jahurabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/akhileshs-vijay-yatra-rollsonto-purvanchal-expressway/articleshow/87766371.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

In two videos posted on social media platforms, the MP can be seen questioning the bank officials for allegedly forcing the farmers to spend money on health insurance. He can also be heard accusing the bank employees of throwing away a farmer’s loan application as he (the farmer) had refused to purchas the health insurance. Rajenimbalkar told TOI, “The farmers queuing up at the bank for crop loans are being forced to purchase health insurance. I have brought this to the notice of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray as well as our party leadership.” The MP has alleged that the officials of the public sector banks are doing these things to achieve the targets set by their bosses. He even demanded that an independent inquiry to ascertain the number of farmers who were forced to purchase the insurance cover. Vishal Pawar, a farmer from Dharur, too leveled allegations against the bank officials and said that he was poorly treated for refusing to buy the health insurance. He said his file was thrown at his father’s face. The allegations, however, have been refuted by the bank officials. They said no farmer was forced to buy the health insurance. When contacted, SBI branch deputy manager Vijaykumar Kamble said: “We never forced any farmer to purchase ‘Arogya Plus’ health insurance, which covers the insured person, the spouse and two children for up to Rs 3 lakh. In addition, the insurance also provides a cover of Rs 3 lakh in case of death.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/mp-pulls-up-bank-staff-for-forcing-farmers-to-buy-health-insurance/articleshow/87764768.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Overall, 108 such visitors have been prohibited from entering the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) so far since November 12, revealed the official data. “Four squads have been formed to check vaccination certificates of visitors before entering the AMC headquarters. Visitors who have not undergone vaccination have been asked to get immunised against Covid-19 first and then seek entry,” said an official release. Notably, the civic administration had earlier made Covid testing mandatory for visiting AMC premises, which saw large-scale screening of the visitors during the second wave of the pandemic. Located near the Town Hall within old city limits, the local civic body receives a large number of visitors every day. The civic authorities have already set November 30 as the deadline for getting at least one dose of Covid vaccine, failing which, curbs will be imposed on the sale of fuel and inter-district travel. Meanwhile, the ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ Covid-19 inoculation campaign to increase vaccination coverage has covered 61,780 homes within the municipal limits of Aurangabad so far.

As per the data, the percentage of children with at least one smartphone increased from 42.3% in 2018 to 85.5% in 2021. But, of the 85.5% of children, only 27% said that they had access to a smartphone every time they wanted to study. The remaining 62.7% reported that they got access sometimes while the remaining 10.3% said that they never got the smartphone to study. Somraj Giradkar, Maharashtra state head for Pratham that prepares the ASER report, said, “A rough estimate here is that one out of ten children purchased smartphones during the lockdown. In most households, if there is only one phone, it is with the father. Hence, the maximum students (62.7%) have fallen in the category which gets access sometimes. The 27% of children that always have access comprises mostly older children. Parents feel they cannot entrust young children with a cellphone of their own. However, compared to the national average, Maharashtra is doing well.” National statistics show that only 67.6% of students have at least one smartphone in their home of which 26.1% of students have no access to it for their studies. The survey covered 990 villages in 33 districts of the state covering 4,242 households with 4,023 children. A total of 70.4% of parents supported their wards while studying which is also coupled with the fact that study material availability among children has increased from 80.8% last year to 89.8% this year. Mahendra Ganpule, state spokesperson of Maharashtra Headmasters’ Association said that more parents have got involved with their ward’s education during the lockdown than was previously observed. “During the lockdown, many school-related activities required parental guidance. Hence, even if the parents were illiterate or school dropouts, they still were helping students with the activities or at least making them do their work which was previously taken as solely the teacher’s job. Secondly, many parents in the rural areas or low-income groups saw wage cuts but they still saved money for internet recharges and such just so that their children could study. Some even cut down on their other expenses to make this happen. Hence, the role of parents during the lockdown in rural areas is commendable. This was also helped by the timely distribution of books and other learning materials both online and offline by the state,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/more-smartphones-in-hand-but-access-elusive-for-pupils/articleshow/87767176.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Late at night, family members of Altaf Bhat were detained near Press Enclave in Srinagar by the police. Earlier in the day, kin of Altaf and another civilian Mudassir Gul, who was also killed in the encounter, held a daylong protest. PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti, who held a protest in Jammu in the morning and returned to Srinagar around 3 pm, was not allowed to go near Press Enclave by the authorities. Around midnight, Mehbooba tweeted from her official Twitter handle: “Instead of handing over mortal remains of the innocent civilians, police has arrested the family members for demanding the bodies of their loved ones. Unbelievably ruthless & insensitive. Least they can do is return the mortal remains immediately.” Earlier in the day, NC president and MP Farooq Abdullah telephoned J&K lieutenant-governor Manoj Sinha and demanded an impartial and time-bound inquiry into the encounter and the return of the bodies of the slain civilians to their kin. However, J&K police has been maintaining that Mudassir was an overground worker for terrorists while Altaf was owner of the building in which terrorists were hiding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/police-detain-slain-civilians-kin-seeking-return-of-body/articleshow/87768880.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Praveen said that the first interrogation by assistant IO, K Venkat Reddy was related to filling the details in interrogation forms and about the paragraph in the affidavit, where it was mentioned that “ACP V Surender interrogated the accused one after another in presence of panchas and drafted the confessional statements,” the word “got” should have preceded the word drafted. Chairman asked, in Disha rape and murder case, the articles were never recovered right? and Praveen said that yes, due to circumstances (referring to exchange of fire). The articles were recovered at 5.12 pm, about 12 hours after the incident by the IO of the alleged encounter case, J Surender Reddy. When advocate Praveen stated that the judicial first class magistrate K Asha Rani, who recorded the statement of his injured clients, did not check about their mental health condition before recording the statement, the chairman asked him why he did not cross-examine the magistrate when she deposed before the commission. When the advocate argued that there was no counter sign of the doctor on the statement recorded by the statement, the chairman said that they grant importance to the signature of the magistrate present on the statement. Chairman asked advocate if any of his clients mentioned in their affidavits that the driver of the bus drove at the instructions of the accused and advocate said that it is not mentioned in affidavits||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/panel-quizzes-copslawyer-on-evidence/articleshow/87767181.cms||---

---||Delhi||How Delhi govt is going extra mile to hire private buses for air emergency||NEW DELHI: The Delhi government is going the extra mile to ensure around 1,000 private buses are deployed to augment the city’s public transport fleet. After transport minister Kailash Gahlot said on Tuesday that the government would hire around 1,000 private buses, the transport department held a meeting with associations of all-India tourist permit, contract carriage and school bus owners and has promised to be flexible to accommodate their demands. Gahlot told TOI on Tuesday that this was being done as an emergency measure and the government was trying to engage 1,000 private buses, though during the implementation of the odd-even scheme in previous years, only around 650 buses could be arranged. During the first edition of the odd-even scheme in January 2016, around 2,900 private buses were deployed on Delhi’s streets under Paryavaran Sewa. At that time, schools were closed and that is why a large number of buses were available. During the second edition in April the same year, only 500 buses were available as school buses couldn’t be used. Shyam Lal Gola, president of All India Luxury Bus Union who attended the meeting on Tuesday, said the operators had agreed to provide buses as long as their genuine demands were met. “The prices of CNG have gone up and the rate per kilometre provided to us should reflect it to make the move viable for us. Also, we have demanded that the payments should be timely.” Gola added that the operators had demanded that the rates should be enough to cover a full day’s salary for the driver, even if the bus was not hired for the entire day as the overhead costs, including maintenance, remained the same. “The validity of documents like fitness certificates, permits etc are ending on November 30 and we have requested that these should be extended up to December 31. Since our buses would be deployed for a month, it would be difficult to get the documents renewed,” he said. “The government has agreed to almost all the demands and has assured that we would face no problem,” Gola added. Ashish Kundra, principal secretary-cum-transport commissioner, told TOI that the associations were receptive and though most had only 50 to 100 buses, they would add up to around 1,000. He said the department and Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) would be flexible with arrangements, such as allowing school buses after school hours, if needed. DTC is also chalking out the routes on which these vehicles will be deployed. The buses will have DTC’s signage and conductors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-delhi-govt-is-going-extra-mile-to-hire-private-buses-for-air-emergency/articleshow/87767184.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Delhi||Court upholds jail term for man over Diwali negligence||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has upheld an order by which a man was sentenced to a six-month jail term for negligently lighting a firecracker on Diwali in 2013, which hit a person’s eye and caused loss of his eyesight.  Additional Sessions Judge Pooran Chand noted that the injuries suffered by the complainant in his right eye were grievous in nature. A magistrate court had convicted and sentenced Naveen to six months in prison for the offences punishable under sections 286 (negligent conduct with respect to explosive substance) and 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the IPC. He was also directed to pay a compensation of Rs 60,000 to the complainant. As per the prosecution, on November 3, 2013, the complainant was standing outside and four-five houses ahead of his house, Naveen, in a rash and negligent manner, lit a Diwali rocket and kicked the bottle, as a result of which the rocket suddenly hit the complainant in his right eye. This injury caused permanent privation of the sight of right eye of the complainant. Initially, the complainant did not realise that it was a serious injury and hence did not file any complaint. However, later on, when the problem in his right eye aggravated, he filed the complaint on November 9, 2013. On his complaint, an FIR was registered and the accused was arrested. Naveen had challenged the magistrate court’s order, saying there was a delay of six days in registration of FIR and there were major contradictions in the testimony of the complainant and the IO. Regarding the delay in registration of FIR, the sessions court said in its order on November 16, that the complainant in his testimony has given a very reasonable explanation regarding the delay in registration of FIR, which is that he had not reported the matter as he had thought that it was just a simple injury, but it was not so later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-upholds-jail-term-for-man-over-diwali-negligence/articleshow/87768039.cms||---

---||Agra||Second time in 5 months, dead fish wash up on Yamuna shores in Agra||AGRA: Hundreds of dead fish once again washed ashore on the banks of Yamuna river, near Rambagh ghat in Agra, on Tuesday, possibly due to discharge of “highly polluted” industrial waste into the river between Mathura and Agra. This is the second such incident in the past five months. Though UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) officials claimed that the dissolved oxygen (DO) levels in the water were more than the permissible limits required for aquatic life, sources said that release of recycled waste water into river after treatment of Yamuna water with high content of chlorine could have been the cause of the death of fish. Besides, non-functional sewage treatment plants in the city could also have contributed to the incident. UPPCB regional officer Vishwanath Sharma said that the report of water samples taken from three different locations after the incident — Kailash ghat (upstream), water works and Dussehra ghat (down-stream) — were found adequate for aquatic life. “The DO level was 7.5mg/l at Kailash ghat, 6 at water works and 4.5 at Dussehra ghat,” he said, adding that aquatic animals require a DO of 4.5 or more. However, a biological oxygen demand (BOD) report is still awaited. Citing the reasons for the dead fish, Sharma said that when the flow of water at Gokul barrage in Mathura was resumed after being stopped for a certain period, mud at the bottom of the river dissolved in the water had depleted the oxygen levels, adversely affecting the aquatic life. However, Gokul barrage officials in Mathura refuted this claim and said that if this was true, then some fish should have also washed ashore there, too. Sources meanwhile told TOI that the sewage treatment plants at points where the Yamuna water enters Agra — Budi ka Nagla and Jaganpur — have been non-functional. Sewage pumping stations in Manoharpura, Balkeshwar, Rajwaha and Naraich are also not working properly, a source added. Four months back, on July 22, shoals of dead fish had washed ashore on the banks of the Yamuna in Agra. Environmentalists in Agra had then said that it is a matter of grave concern and authorities should take it seriously.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/second-time-in-5-months-dead-fish-wash-up-on-yamuna-shores-in-agra/articleshow/87766377.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The city has around 113 tar roads which are 12-metre-wide or above. Of them, 56 roads are in bad shape, according to a report compiled by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s public works department. Highest number of bad tar roads are situated under Lakadganj zone where 11 out of 9 roads are in bad condition and roads in Hanuman Nagar area are in the best condition with just one out of 11 are bad shape. The hotmix department claimed to have carried out patchwork on most of the roads in Lakadganj zone. In Gandhibagh zone, there are around 15 tar roads of 12-metre-wide or above. The department have repaired seven but nine roads are still in bad condition. In Mangalwari zone too eight of 10 roads are in bad condition. Though the department has carried out patchwork in almost all stretches but five are in worst condition and need complete renovation. Under Dharampeth zone, of the 27 different stretches, six roads are in worst condition. Sources in the NMC blamed the elected representatives for the worsening condition of roads in the city. “They only concentrate and ensure pothole-free roads in residential areas, while the major thoroughfares remain negligected,” sources said. A senior official from the NMC’s PWD said that the civic body has taken up the job of repairing potholes on war-footing basis. “Besides, this we have shortlisted 14 roads which will be renewed completely,” he said, while there are proposals to convert four tar roads into cement concretization. Similarly, Nagpur Improvement Trust and state’s public works department too will either renew the existing tar roads or may convert them into cement roads, the official said. The code of conduct imposed for MLC election has also affected the renewal of several roads in the city. The tender invitation process of many roads got stalled due to the model code of conduct came into force, admitted the official. To a query, the official said that in anticipation of the MLC polls, the NMC had completed the tender process of renovation of Civil Lines roads. Even the work is under progress, the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/around-50-of-12-metre-or-wider-roads-in-city-still-have-potholes/articleshow/87767204.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Widows of three manual scavengers to get Rs 26 lakh||MUMBAI: Following a Bombay high court order two months back, Maharashtra government on November 16 approved a one-time special compensation of over Rs 26 lakh to heirs of three manual scavengers who died while descending into a contaminated sewer in Govandi in December 2019.  The HC had on September 17 directed the district collector to pay Rs 10 lakh compensation to each within four weeks after terming the case as “eye-opening”. The workers died while cleaning a septic tank at Morya Housing Society. Isha Singh, counsel for the widows who approached the HC for compensation, argued that even though the deaths took place consequent to a housing society employing individuals as manual scavengers, the state had to compensate them. She said the state had a duty to eradicate manual scavenging under Article 17 of the Constitution (abolition of untouchability), hence the compensation be paid by the state for their loss. Government pleader Poornima Kantharia had said the state was willing to rehabilitate Bani Debnath, Neeta Kalshekar and Vimla Chorotiya by providing their children scholarships. A bench of Justices Ujjal Bhuyan and Madhav Jamdar had directed the compensation gave the state liberty to recover the amount from private employers. Last week the widows informed the HC that the state was yet to comply. The State sought time and attracted a wry observation from the holiday bench headed by Justice S J Kathawalla “red tapism is the cause of all problems''. The State then assured it would be done by November 18. The State government resolution (GR) on Tuesday to ensure the payment said the amount os Rs 26.5 lakh –Rs 8.75 lakh each to the three families--be made available immediately to the Collector, Mumbai Suburbs, and said it is necessary to recover the private builder. The State had paid Rs 1.25 lakh each earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-widows-of-3-manual-scavengers-to-get-rs-26l/articleshow/87768648.cms||Swati Deshpande

This posed challenges before the dairy that is planning to ramp up supply to the state capital. According to the daily authorities, the most common way of adulteration is piercing the pouch with a syringe and drawing the milk out. The pouch is then filled with the water. According to the authorities, hundreds of litres of milk were being adulterated. Vishwas Patil, the chairman of the dairy, said, “With the new packaging, if the pouch is pierced, a blue colour present in one of the layers will spread automatically. It will impart a dark colour to the pouch which, will be a sign for customers that the milk is adulterated. Right now, the new packaging will be used for the milk sold in Mumbai. Slowly it will be used for other places as well.” The new packaging is manufactured in the dairy’s Mumbai-based plant. The dairy sells around 12 lakh litres of milk in Mumbai. Patil said the dairy will gradually increase collection to 20 lakh litres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/gokul-introduces-5-layer-milk-pouches/articleshow/87764814.cms||---

Currently, as per Covid restrictions, swimming pools are open only for those swimmers who have participated at district, state and national levels above the age of 10. Most swimming pools in the city are run by the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation while some by private entities. Hundreds of people used to turn up for swimming at these pools before the pandemic started. Ramesh More, an activist from Kolhapur, said, “Most pools are deserted owing to the restrictions. We have written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray requesting him to open the pools not just in Kolhapur city but across the state. Let the government allow vaccinated citizens use the facility. Swimming is the best form of exercise and many prefer it over other exercises.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/activists-open-swimming-pools-for-all/articleshow/87765549.cms||---

---||Delhi||Don’t have PUC? A visit to petrol pump in Delhi could set you back by Rs 10,000||NEW DELHI: If you don’t have a valid Pollution Under Control Certificate (PUCC) for your vehicle, visiting a petrol pump will likely set you back by Rs 10,000. As part of its initiative to reduce vehicular pollution, Delhi government is deploying officials at filling stations to prosecute vehicles without PUCC. “The enforcement drive against polluting vehicles, which are either visibly polluting or don’t have a valid PUC Certificate, have been going on aggressively for nearly two months,” transport minister Kailash Gahlot told TOI. He added that the number of vehicles getting checked for pollution has gone up drastically in the last couple of months due to the stringent measure. “We have now gone a step ahead and deployed our teams at petrol pumps, where it wouldn’t be possible to refuel a vehicle without a PUCC. We have been advising vehicle owners to get PUC checks done for a long time,” Gahlot said. Civil Defence volunteers will also be deployed at filling stations to help pollution control officers. Mobile teams of the transport department’s enforcement wing would also be present at many places. “We have also deployed Civil Defence volunteers to assist the enforcement officials. Only the officials would issue the fine,” he said. On Tuesday, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) directions regarding vehicular pollution included that plying of visibly polluting vehicles and vehicles without PUC in NCR needs to be stopped. “Checks for PUC may be primarily carried out at the petrol pumps, to obviate congestion on free roads,” the directions stated. Transport department officials said that all 60 teams of the enforcement wing would be deployed at different locations every day and would aggressively carry out a drive against visibly polluting vehicles and vehicles without PUCC. “Apart from major intersections and other locations, teams would be deployed at petrol pumps too,” an official said. “While regular checks on polluting vehicles are carried out throughout the year, special drives happen during the winter months,” he said. The transport department had started gearing for the winter season from September itself to try and keep polluting vehicles off the roads of Delhi. The department has been issuing regular public notices to create awareness about the need to get pollution checks done, apart from reaching out to owners of vehicles with expired PUCC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dont-have-puc-a-visit-to-petrol-pump-could-set-you-back-by-rs-10000/articleshow/87767237.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Delhi||Delhi: Mercury under 10 degrees Celsius for the first time this season||NEW DELHI: The city recorded the lowest minimum temperature of the season at 9.6 degrees Celsius, three degrees below normal, at base station Safdarjung on Wednesday. The night temperature dropped below 10 degrees Celsius at three other stations too — Ayanagar (9.1 degrees Celsius), Lodhi Road (9.8) and Mungeshpur (9.4). A Met official said that since the wind direction was predicted to change to easterly, the minimum temperature was likely to rise marginally over the next three days. However, isolated cold wave conditions were seen in Delhi on Wednesday as cold wave was reported at Ayanagar, where the night temperature dipped five degrees below normal. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), the criteria for a cold wave is that the minimum temperature should be 4 or more degrees below normal or when the minimum temperature is less than 4 degrees Celsius. IMD data shows that the lowest minimum temperature recorded in November last year was 6.3 degrees Celsius. In 2019, the lowest minimum temperature was reported on November 20 at 11.4 degrees Celsius. IMD’s forecast says the minimum temperature is likely to hover around 11-12 degrees Celsius for the next few days. R K Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD, said, “A western disturbance is likely to impact Jammu and Kashmir on November 19-20 and under its influence, the easterly winds are expected to set in, causing rise in minimum temperature. As partial rain is expected over Rajasthan, it is likely to cause cloudiness over Delhi on November 19 night. Easterly winds are expected to add more moisture.” Though northeasterly or easterly winds blew for a few hours during the day, Met officials said more consolidated easterly winds were expected over the city on November 19. “As northwesterly winds are likely to return on November 21, the minimum temperature may again start dipping,” said Jenamani. He added that as relative strong winds were likely on November 21, it would help in cleaning Delhi’s air, causing dispersion of pollutants. According to IMD, the visibility improved on Wednesday as it was in the range of 1,500-2,100 metres at both Safdarjung and Palam, while it was below 1,200 metres two days ago. Mahesh Palawat of Skymet Weather, a private weather forecasting agency, said, “The night temperature dipped on Wednesday due to northwesterly winds, which are cold and dry, while easterly winds are warm and humid.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mercury-under-10c-for-the-first-time-this-season/articleshow/87767231.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Despite four patients dying in a major fire on April 12, and lack of various permissions and safety systems, the private hospital had resumed operations within a month. TOI had on November 13 highlighted the violations and inaction from CS even though Wadi Municipal Council had sent a letter asking to shut down the hospital. Paturkar told TOI, “I received detailed information from Wadi Municipal Council about violations at the hospital. I issued notice directing the hospital to stop medical practice with immediate effect a couple of days ago.” Asked about validity of permission given by him, Paturkar said, “Hospital did not comply with all permissions and safety measures required for operation. Therefore, I did not renew the registration a single time in my tenure.” An official from the office of CS said registration of the hospital lapsed on April 1, and is yet to be renewed. Paturkar also said his office sent a copy of notice issued to the hospital to concerned authorities for action. “Now it is the responsibility of concerned authorities to ensure closure of the hospital, as we did whatever is required from our side,” he said. On Wednesday, the hospital was still operational. Dr Rahul Thawre from the hospital said, “We did not receive any notice from CS directing to close down the hospital. I am out of city so will have to verify. We have not done any violations, so any question of action does not arise at all. Everything is in place at the hospital.” The hospital is operating on the second, third and fourth floor of a commercial building — Pooja Chambers. There are commercial shops on ground and first floor. As per notices of Wadi Municipal Council, the building lacks building plan sanction and fire NOC. Also, the building does not have parking. The hospital has placed oxygen cylinders in side margin of the building with oxygen supply system. Combustible materials are stored on staircase and generators operate below the staircase. The building also lacks a second staircase. Wadi police had booked Thawre in the death of four patients in the fire.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cs-directs-closure-of-well-treat-hospital-lacking-permissions-safety-systems/articleshow/87767232.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

As a part of the Congress’s ongoing campaign ‘Ladki hoon, lad sakti hoon’ slogan, Priyanka men women from all strata of the society, mainly for low-income groups, who listened attentively to the Congress leader’s programmes for women empowerment.  Interacting on a specially built stage over a boat, Priyanka sat with the women, who were mainly Anganwadi workers, ASHA workers, lawyers and members of self-help groups, and discussed their problems at home and at work. “Since ages women have to fight for their rights and have been suppressed. If you want your due right, then you will have to fight for it as you represent half of the population. Therefore, our party has thought of giving tickets to 40% women in the upcoming state elections because only a woman can understand the feelings of another woman and raise their problems in a proper manner,” said Priyanka, promising to give smart phones to girls if the party came to power in the state. She also announced that if Congress comes to power, the widow pension will be increased to Rs 1,000 and Aganwadi workers will be given a stipend of Rs 10,000 apart from scootys to those girl students who have to travel long distances for studies. She further said that the Congress has decided to open 75 schools on the lines of Kendriya Vidyalayas which will be only for girls in which it will be ensured that knowledge for skilled work is also imparted other than regular studies. She assured them that the party would stand by them and help them in every possible way to solve their problems. Recalling her visit to Lalitpur a few days ago, Priyanka said that farmers are dying while standing for hours in queues for procuring fertilisers. Moreover, the greatest problem for women is running their house with the skyrocketing price of LPG cylinders and edible oil. “The entire region is reeling under a water crisis with a number of families lining up in a single tap. It is so sad that buses are being lined up for ferrying people to attend the rally of the PM in Jhansi on November 19 while no bus was provided to the labourers during Covid-19 crisis,” she alleged. The Congress leader also offered prayers at the Matha Gajendranath Shiv temple and Kamatanath temple.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/fight-for-your-rights-priyankaexhorts-women-in-chitrakoot/articleshow/87766425.cms||---

MSEDCL Kolhapur staffer Amol Vilas Chavan in the police complaint stated that he found the power supply restored illegally at Ahuja's residence. “The power supply to Ahuja's residence was disconnected permanently in March for default in payment of dues. However, he restored the connection illegally with the help of an electrician. Since March, around 9,200 units of power worth Rs 2.28 lakh has been consumed by him.” “We suspect such illegal restoration of connection has been done by several other defaulters as well, which is causing loss to MSEDCL,” said Chavan. The MSEDCL has issued notices to the large defaulters and has started disconnecting the supply to the repeated defaulters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/fir-against-trader-for-power-theft/articleshow/87765568.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Both camps draw up plans to win Kolhapur MLC election||CLEARED SKHER Kolhapur: The action for the MLC election for Kolhapur local body constituency has started heating up as the candidates of the two major fronts — one led by Congress and the other by Bharatiya Janata Party — are finalised. Sitting MLC Satej Patil will be Congress candidate and former MLA Amal Mahadik will be BJP’s nominee. Since the election is going to be held by secret ballot voting, the candidates are being extra cautious. There are 416 members of local bodies, who are electors in this election. Satej had recently claimed that he has support of 253 electors, which more than sufficient number to win the election easily. Satej has deployed a team of close confidantes to win support from each local body. Sharangdhar Deshmukh, Congress leader and former corporator, said, “The teams are in touch with the electors. We have entrusted them with the task of developing bonding with the electors.” Mahadik team’s strategy is to meet electors individually. Also, they are trying to meet the leaders of the electors. For instance, the Mahadik camp claims that they have support of MLAs Vinay Kore and Prakash Awade, who have their supporters as members of local bodies. However, according to political experts, taking leaders on board does not make major difference since it is simply hard to know who has voted for whom. Political commentator Gurubal Mali said, “Getting leaders on board does not always work for the candidates. Many times, the electors think rationally. Sometimes personal bonding also works. The politics of taking electors to resorts till voting day works only if the electors have their allegiance with a party or a candidate.” The voting for the MLC election is on December 10. The candidates have a little more than three weeks to get the numbers on their side. The election is crucial for Satej Patil, if he wins, it will put a stamp on his leadership across the district and if Mahadik wins, then it would be a resurgence of the Mahadik group, which has faced successive electoral defeats since 2015 MLC election.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/both-camps-draw-up-plans-to-win-kolhapur-mlc-election/articleshow/87764827.cms||---

In his petition, he stated that the policy note of the HR and CE department for the year 2020-21, states that 34,102 temples in the state have an annual income of less than Rs 10,000. This is a matter of great concern. He stated that the present circumstances surrounding the temples may not be to the expected standards. It is necessary that the temples are maintained properly so that the spiritual process and the rituals are performed for the people to experience the purpose for which the temples were consecrated. He stated that an external audit of the nearly 44,000 temples was required to find out the status of temple structures, lands, immovable assets, possession and occupation of the temple properties, the rents received and the dues. That apart, status of other assets like temple chariots, form of rituals and spiritual practices associated with the individual temples, funds being received from the people and the fees and the state of these funds is also required to be ascertained. The external audit should be conducted by setting up a commission of eminent people. A division bench of justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P Velmurugan sought a response from the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/sadhguru-seeks-audit-of-hrce-temples/articleshow/87767225.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Maintain Covid testing momentum even if cases turn nil, local authorities told||PUNE: Local authorities have been directed to maintain the Covid testing momentum in areas with zero weekly positivity or that below the state average of 1.35% to keep the infection spread at its lowest. Last week, Gondia and Nandurbar registered zero positivity rates, while 22 other districts across the state recorded below 100 cases. “The number of active cases has been in the range of 800-1,000 over the last fortnight. Many districts need to scale up testing too,” a state health department official said. During the Diwali week, the weekly testing numbers had halved to about 5.5 lakh as against a normal of 10-11 lakh tests. State task force members said even as the numbers were going down, it was necessary for these districts to prevent any new cases. “While cases are down, there should be no laxity in testing. There is a need to scale up testing in all these districts,” task force member Dr Rahul Pandit said. Dharavi, one of the largest slums in Asia, has seen 37 days of zero infections since the second wave. However, that does not mean that such pockets should be ignored. “Continuous testing is the only way to avoid any sudden rise in cases,” a health official from Mumbai said. In the cabinet note last week, nearly 22 districts registered less than 100 active cases, with the lowest numbers being recorded from Nandurbar and Washim. However, it was found that the weekly testing in these districts too has become dismal. “In the Diwali week, the weekly testing was less than 500 for Nandurbar and it was just 528 for Washim. Nearly seven districts registered weekly testing below 1,000,” another health official said. Public health expert and former state health director Dr PP Doke told TOI that the state was at a very crucial phase as there were hardly any case rise despite restrictions being lifted during the Diwali period. “Two incubation periods (pre- and post-Diwali) have not shown a large variation and if there is no rise in cases in the coming weeks, we can safely state that Maharashtra has reached low endemic phase,” he said. Dr Doke, however, cautioned against letting the guard down and said people should continue following the Covid protocols and scale up testing as well as vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maintain-testing-momentum-even-if-cases-turn-nil-local-authorities-told/articleshow/87767228.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Delhi||Delhi: EDMC sprays insecticides using drones to curb mosquito menace||NEW DELHI: To control mosquito breeding on the banks of Yamuna, East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has started spraying insecticides using a drone. According to an official, as water levels recede post-monsoon, mosquito breeding increases near the river bank. Measures to control breeding in the border areas have also been intensified. “We have started spraying anti-larval medicine by a drone at spots that municipal employees can't access. Drones were used on a pilot basis for spraying anti-larva spray on the banks of river Yamuna and behind Yamuna Bank Metro Station. Chances of mosquito breeding are high in these locations,” said EDMC mayor Shyam Sundar Agarwal. “The civic body has hired only one drone for now, but if its results are good, then more drones will be hired under the anti-dengue program in the future,” said EDMC standing committee chairman Beer Singh Panwar. Each drone can carry 10-12 litres of anti-larva spray in containers fitted with the drone and cover a distance of three kilometres at a time, said an official. The civic bodies had used the drone to spray disinfectant at narrow lanes during the Covid pandemic in early 2020. The initiative aimed to cover a larger area in one day and minimise the chances of spreading infection in public spaces. The civic agencies have reported nine deaths and 5,277 cases due to dengue in the city till November 13. The numbers of cases are higher than the total cases reported till December end in the entire city since 2016. In 2016 dengue cases reported were 4,431; in 2017, it was 4,726, 2,798 reported in 2019 and 2,036 in 2019. In 2020, 1,072 total cases were reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-sprays-insecticides-using-drones-to-curb-mosquito-menace/articleshow/87767249.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana farmers at their wit’s end over alternative crop plan for paddy||HYDERABAD: Farmers in the state are at their wits’ end because the sowing season for alternate crops has already passed. The agriculture department devised a plan in which farmers are encouraged to cultivate sunflower, groundnut and red gram as alternative crops. Surprisingly, only 600 acres was under paddy, with the rest planted in food crops such as maize. Nagarkurnool district had the distinction of most farmland brought under cultivation (1.49 lakh acres). Farmers who want to cultivate other crops, on the other hand, are concerned because the sowing season for those crops is over. “We are also concerned that if we plant crops like groundnut, we will lose money because the price will not be viable,” KR Ramesh Reddy, a farmer, explained. In the last few days, the agriculture department has been distributing brochures on alternate crops. However, there was no clarification on how to shift to other crops in case of land parcels that have been under paddy cultivation for more than four to five years. The government has already divided districts into two categories based on the number of acres where paddy was planted in the previous season. The average paddy extent in the summer season was around 31 lakh acres, but this has already gone up to 60 lakh acres in the last season. All districts having more than 2 lakh acres have been designated as paddy priority districts where alternate crops must be grown. Suryapet had the highest paddy acreage at 4.50 lakh acres, followed by Nalgonda (4.56 lakh acres), Nizamabad (3.91 lakh acres), Siddipet (3.13 lakh acres), Khammam (2.95 lakh acres), Karimnagar (2.92 lakh acres), Kamareddy (2.76 lakh acres), Yadadri Bhuvnagiri (2.72 lakh acres), Medak (2.55 lakh acres) and Mahabubabad (2.13 lakh acres).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/farmers-at-their-wits-end-over-alternative-crop-plan-for-paddy/articleshow/87767223.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Local residents and commuters have said civic authorities and Metro officials should undertake cleaning drives and conduct checks to ensure Metro medians are not turned into waste dumping sites. Garbage and debris have been dumped at medians which are part of the Metro line along Karve Road, Paud Road and the area below a viaduct near the Vanaz depot. Jai Joshi, who regularly travels on Karve Road and Paud Road, said garbage dumping at Metro medians is rampant. “If not maintained properly, these medians may become garbage dumping spots,” Joshi said. The Metro viaduct passes through the middle of roads with medians below. Metro officials have planned to fill the medians with soil and plant trees. Ashutosh Rasne, who travels frequently on Paud Road, said that since the viaduct is ready and work is nearly complete, there should be focus on maintaining the infrastructure, “Dumping of garbage is one among many challenges MahaMetro and the municipal corporation will have to tackle. There will be encroachments and illegal use of space too. Authorities should deal with these issues promptly,” Rasne said. Ajay Shah, who owns a shop on Paud Road, said the municipal corporation should take the initiative in maintenance as the roads belong to the civic administration. “The responsibility of maintenance and cleaning should be assigned in advance,” he added. Hemant Sonawane, general manager (PR) at MahaMetro, said, “We will be jointly working with the civic body to clean garbage and will also come up with a plan for tree plantation and beautification.” Sonawane said the medians will be developed along the lines of traffic islands. The plan has not been taken up yet as Metro work is still under way at many stretches. “But we will come up with a plan with the PMC,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/garbage-debris-litter-medians-along-metro-residents-seek-action/articleshow/87767250.cms||Sarang Dastane

The apex body granted a ‘certificate of approval’ to the British-era club for two years from Tuesday till November 15, 2023. With this mandatory approval, the Maharashtra government run club can now admit students for training and award them Private Pilot License (PPL) and Commercial Private License (CPL) required for flying aircraft in India. TOI had been tracking the NFC’s development through a series of articles, ever since it was closed. “The certification means we can officially restart our operations. We can also purchase new planes and demand funds from the government for the purpose. The Mahajyoti had already granted us Rs2.5 crore funds for training OBC students here. We would soon be approaching the government tribal department to offer similar funds for training tribal students,” an elated divisional commissioner Parajakta Lavangare Varma, the ex-officio chairman, told TOI. She said she was also keen to take help from alumni in running the prestigious club that was once pride of the city and had churned out several pilots, some even served in the Indian Air Force (IAF), while others flew commercial planes in India as well as abroad. NFC’s maintenance cum accountable manager Pragnesh Sisodia said they would soon float an advertisement inviting applications from the aspirants. “The DGCA had already awarded air-worthiness certificates to our four aircraft. We would be initially admitting a batch of 40 students and then expand their number subsequently, once we commence our operations in a full-fledged mode. They would be selected through written-cum-verbal test. We have already appointed assistant flying instructors and other ground staff for running the club’s operations and training students.” The HC has a major role to play in its reopening as it had directed all concerned authorities to make efforts to restart the club. A PIL (No13/2016) was filed by late Flt Lt Shridhar Ghatate through counsel Shriniwas Deshpande and then pursued by his wife Sumedha, after the British-era club stopped operating on account of the government’s apathy. Since 2003, Deshpande, who is himself an NFC alumni, has been fighting for its revival without charging a penny. The HC had even asked the government to grant Rs1 lakh to Deshpande towards the cost of litigation for single-handedly pursuing the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/decks-cleared-for-nagpur-flying-clubs-take-off-after-dgca-approval/articleshow/87767263.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Kanpur||Minister expresses displeasure over construction of new terminal building at Chakeri airport||Done/ALVI Times News Network Kanpur: Minister for civil aviation, UP, Nand Gopal Gupta Nandi, visited the under-construction new terminal building of Chakeri airport on Wednesday and expressed his displeasure over slow pace of working. He said carelessness would not be tolerated. The government would not only lodge FIRs against the officials of UP Rajkiya Nirman Nigam, the construction agency but even send them to jail, he warned. The agency could even be blacklisted if it failed to complete the job in the stipulated time, he said, and added the construction work of the civil enclave of Chakeri airport must be completed by December 31. During the minister’s visit to the Chakeri airport on November 1, the people’s representatives and passengers had complained to him about delay in construction of the civil enclave. Witnessing an increase in the number of passengers at the airport and after receiving the inquiry report, he came to know that the construction agency was not serious in constructing the building in time. In view of the complaints, the aviation minister on Wednesday visited Kanpur and chaired the review meeting which was attended among others by regional executive director Airport Authority of India DK Kamra, district magistrate Kanpur Nagar, Vishak G Iyer, officer of UP Rajkiya Nirman Nigam Satyaveer, additional director, civil aviation department Vishwa Bhushan Mishra, nodal officer Moti Rai and director, Chakeri airport BK Jha. The officials informed the minister that construction work of the new civil enclave had started in October 2019, and only 60 percent work could be completed in the last two years. At this, the minister got furious and said that by December 2021 the construction of the new terminal must be completed by December this year. Any carelessness would not be tolerated, he warned. He specifically directed the officials to start within 15 days the construction work of a 2.7 km-long four laned approach which would connect the new terminal. At present only one flight can be operated from the Chakri airport because it has just one apron where aircrafts are parked. The new civil enclave, which will have three aprons, can bear the load of around 500 persons at a time and can also handle three flights at a time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/minister-expresses-displeasure-over-construction-of-new-terminal-building-at-chakeri-airport/articleshow/87766428.cms||अनंत नारायण

A division bench of justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P Velmurugan was hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by S Rajendran, a resident of Bibikulam in Madurai. In his petition, Rajendran stated that recently he came to know that the shops which are functioning at Pudhu Mandapam, a heritage structure are to be shifted to the nearby Kunnathur Chathiram complex. He stated that nearly 300 shops were functioning at the Pudhu Mandapam and 20 shops in the old Kunnathur Chathiram building which was demolished in 2006. He stated that the authorities had promised to accommodate all the 300 shops and the 20 shops in the Kunnathur Chathiram complex. However, the newly-constructed complex has only the capacity to house only 200 shops. The pathways and the stairs in the building were also very narrow. He stated that the new complex which is a three-storeyed building has only one entrance and exit in the ground floor. As per the rules, each floor should have a separate exit. He stated that the shopping complex also does not have any separate emergency exit due to which the people would face difficulties while evacuating the building in case of emergencies. He further stated that there is no sufficient parking facility and no proper drainage facility due to which there is a possibility of water stagnation during the rainy season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/ensure-compliance-of-norms-at-kunnathur-chathiram-plea-in-hc/articleshow/87767251.cms||---
---||Kanpur||Atmanirbhar Bharat also means aiming to ‘make for the world’, says Rajnath||Jhansi: Raising the pitch for a self-reliant India, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday asserted that “the country is heading towards a strong Atmanirbhar Bharat, which not only means eyeing for ‘made in India’ products, but also aiming to ‘make for the world”. The defence minister was speaking after inaugurating the three-day ‘Rashtraraksha Samarpan Parv Jalsa’ in Jhansi in the presence of UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath at Muktakashi Manch near the historic Jhansi Fort. The event will witness a number of events related to the country's march towards attaining self-reliance in defence manufacturing. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to attend the concluding day on November 19, which happens to be the 193rd birth anniversary of Rani Laxmibai, the Rani of Jhansi. Praising Yogi and his work, Rajnath said, “He is a perfect combination of ‘karmyogi’ and ‘bhaktyogi’, who with his charismatic work has earned praise in the entire country, specially for handling law and order situations. This is the charisma of the Yogi Government that mafia elements’ heartbeat increases by the very name of Yogi. This is new India and new UP, where planes land on expressways and can be used for air traffic also.” Rajnath further said, “Gandhi’s ideology of Swadeshi is similar to Atmanirbhar Bharat concept, which the BJP is committed to fulfil. After independence we were struggling to establish ourselves depending completely on foreign aid. But now the country is heading towards strategic freedom and in the coming decade, we will make all our weapons and defence-related spares in our own country.” He said, “The government has given a whopping Rs 50,000 crores worth orders for defence equipment to the Hindustan Aeronautical Limited (HAL), which has happened for the first time in the country’s history. He also said that 10,000 MSME units are directly attached to the defence sector and as many as 209 types of equipment will be produced indigenously. “There was a time when 65% of defence equipment used to be imported, but today we have decided to generate work worth 64% of the capital budget indigenously. Whatever challenge comes our way we will face it just like Rani Laxmibai did. We are blessed that this country has the largest number of youth population,” Singh said, signifying the fact that the country is facing both conventional and non-conventional threats, including cyber and space threats other than terrorism and border issues. Praising the achievements of the country, Singh said that the life expectancy was only 32 years just after the independence which has increased to 70 years at present. “Similarly, literacy has reached 80% from 12% and the government is targeting to further make it cent percent. Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, our country has attained the vaccination target of 111 crore which is remarkable”. Recalling Rani Laxmibai’s contribution in the country's independence, Singh said, “The women have played an important role in the history of the country during the freedom movement but their role became marginalised after independence. But, in the Modi administration women have been given due importance.” “When I was the home minister, I had issued an advisory to include 35% women in police services. Today, the defence services have also opened the doors for the women. They are being admitted in both Sainik Schools and NDA and are being given permanent commission. Two lakh women had written the last competitive exam of NDA,” he added. Singh also inaugurated a three-day army equipment display at the Hati Ground, where the army has displayed some of the latest equipment used in modern warfare with a separate stall of DRDO showcasing latest inventions in arms and armaments. In his brief speech, Yogi said that it is a matter of pride that the defence corridor project in UP is surging ahead in a speedy manner and two of its important nodes fall in Bundelkhand region, including Jhansi and Chitrakoot. The CM promised that the Bundelkhand region, known for drought, will witness piped drinking water in each house of each village under ‘Har Ghar Nal Jal’ scheme by March 2022. “The supreme sacrifice of Rani Laxmibai will always motivate each and every Indian to become patriotic. The Rani was instrumental in fighting the British forces. Fables have always stated the valour of Rani and that of people of this region. Her famous line ‘I will not give my Jhansi’, sends shivers down the spine of each Indian. There is no better time than this when we are celebrating the 193rd birth anniversary of Rani along with 75 years of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav,” Yogi said. Box Story CM takes stock of preparations ahead of PM’s visit UP CM Yogi Adityanath visited Jhansi on Wednesday to review the preparations ahead of the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi scheduled on November 19. He went to the venue where the PM will address a limited gathering and dedicate/lay the foundation of a number of projects, including laying of the foundation stone of a Rs 400 crore plant under Bharat Dynamics for making propulsion system for anti-tank guided missiles. The CM also visited the Jhansi Fort, which is also scheduled to be visited by the PM. The CM later shared the dais with the Defence Minister for the inaugural ceremony of the Jalsa Parv.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/atmanirbhar-bharat-also-means-aiming-to-make-for-the-world-says-rajnath/articleshow/87766427.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Lulu is now Corp’s biggest tax payer; Rs 3.5cr annually||Thiruvananthapuram: Lulu shopping mall at Akkulam with its sprawling dimensions is now the biggest source of property tax for the city corporation. The civic body received a whopping Rs 3.51 crores from Lulu mall as annual property tax for the ongoing fiscal the other day. It was a mammoth assessment exercise for the Kadakampally zone office revenue team and they finished the assessment of 293 units in three days which has also projected the city corporation’s business friendly image in the city. This is the biggest amount ever received as property tax by the city corporation in its history and probably the quickest assessment for an expansive commercial building. Lulu's tax is actually double the cumulative tax paid by top tax payers in the city; three other shopping malls. Corporation collects Rs 1.5 crore annually from three major shopping malls in the city The entire Lulu building was categorised under different occupancies like cinema, office and the mall inclusive of parking area and utility space. About 12 screens measuring 11,096.30 sq.m were assessed at the rate of Rs 60 per sq.m. The office space measuring 2,320.04 sq.m was assessed at Rs 80 per sq.m. The tax for mall area and the parking area together comprising 1.99 lakh sq.m was assessed at Rs 150 per sq.m. In portions where the dimensions were below 200 sq.m tax was calculated at Rs 90 per sq.m. About 1,685 parking units were assessed for tax and a multi-level car parking facility was also included in the tax assessment. The library cess and service cess together accounted for almost half a crore - Rs 45.7 lakhs. Sources said that calculating tax for 293 units was a herculean task. There had to be proportionate calculations based on type of flooring and availability of centralised air-conditioning facility which will account for 15% increase in tax. The corporation also may have grossed an additional Rs 75 lakhs if the zone of the mall was different. Since Kadakampally was earlier a panchayat area, it was included in the tertiary zone which resulted in 20% tax reduction. The engineering wing had undertaken a total station survey prior to issuance of completion certificate for the building; which again was a tedious task given the size and extent of the building. The corporation officials said that there could be more revenue flow from the mall in the form of trade licenses once the commercial building is open to business. Payment of Rs 3 crores comes at a time when the corporation is publishing a list of arrears in each ward which runs into lakhs. Owing to Covid, there has been a yawning gap in the revenue and expenditure of the city corporation for the past few months. As per the figures compiled by the corporation in August, the inflow of revenue was just Rs 16 crores while the expenses had ballooned to Rs 114 crores. The alarming disparity in income and expenditure had forced the corporation to go out on a tax collection drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/lulu-is-now-corps-biggest-tax-payer-rs-3-5cr-annually/articleshow/87744781.cms||Aswin J Kumar

We had demanded permission to organise a blood donation camp following the state government’s appeal about blood scarcity in the state. But, the state government didn't give permission for the camp. The police stopped us, but still we arranged blood donation camp in a nearby hall.” He added, “If suspension orders are issued for those participating in the strike then we will intensify our protest. The state government should not exploit us.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/msrtc-issues-notices-to-40-daily-wagers-in-kolhapur/articleshow/87764844.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Most Telangana students can access smartphones, says report||HYDERABAD: A significant number of students in Telangana have moved to government schools compared to other states as income levels fell due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but students in the state have more access to smartphones and textbooks. According to the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), 2021, there has been a clear shift from private schools to government schools in the last three years with 60% school-going children in the six to 14 age group in Telangana opting for government schools. About 57.6% boys and 62.9% girl enrolled in government schools in 2021, marking the 3.6% shift since 2018. In government schools across India, the average enrolment in 2018 was 64.3% which increased to 65.8% last year and 70.3% this year. Uttar Pradesh and Kerala reported the maximum increase in government school enrolment, with 13.2% and 11.9% respectively. Andhra Pradesh (8.4%) reported higher migration to state-run schools. Overall, at an all-India level, for children in the age group of six to 14, enrolment in private schools decreased from 32.5% in 2018 to 24.4% in 2021, the 16th ASER report stated. Families in Telangana and other states have not lost faith in education with almost 92% of children having textbooks of their own. About 87.6% kids in private and 93.2% kids in Telangana said they have access to textbooks, underscoring the government’s efforts to ensure books for all, especially in rural India. About 9.6% of the enrolled children in Telangana are taking private tuitions, marking a 3.7% increase since 2018. The largest increase has been among the most disadvantaged households, the report said. The usage of smartphones in Telangana have also increased to 79.3% compared to 45.8% in 2018, with more than 42.2% kids saying they have accessed classes with it. About 23.9% kids in Telangana said they could not access smartphones for studies at home, despite having one. The ASER is a household survey that provides nationally representative estimates of children's schooling status and their educational skills among the age group of 3-16 in all rural districts of India. “Last year, Covid-19 interrupted this trajectory, along with so much else. But with schools being closed since March 2020, understanding the effect of the pandemic on schools, families and children was crucial,” the report said. The report is based on a survey that was conducted in 25 states and three Union Territories. It covered a total of 76,706 households and 75,234 children in the age group of five to 16 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/most-t-students-can-access-smartphones/articleshow/87767254.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi's air quality a tad better but still in ‘very poor’ zone||NEW DELHI: Improvement might connote a wrong impression, but Delhi’s air quality did go from ‘severe’ on Tuesday to ‘very poor’ on Wednesday due to the easterly winds that barred the intrusion into the city of emission from stubble fires in the neighbouring states. A more sustained relief may only come three days later when the winds become stronger. On Wednesday, the air quality index (AQI) of Delhi logged 375 against 403 a day earlier. However, the PM2.5 level was over three times the safe limit of 60 micrograms per cubic metres at 195.7 to 218.8 micrograms per cubic metres. Even then, the capital was the third most polluted city in the country after Jind (382) and Faridabad (378). The easterly winds were not strong enough to transport the fire emissions and Delhi’s air quality was unlikely to worsen for the next two days. There won’t, however, be much improvement, with the air remaining in the higher to mid-range of the ‘very poor’ category. “Most of the winds during the day were south-easterly and easterly in direction, leading to a drop in the intrusion of excessive pollutants from stubble burning. That is perhaps the reason that city’s air came down from severe category. However the air is still very poor and will continue to be so for the next two days because the easterly and south-easterly winds will be slow and not capable of dispersing the pollutants,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, climate change and meteorology, Skymet. According to India Meteorological Department, the maximum wind speed on Wednesday was 8kmph. Met officials felt the quality could improve from November 21. “There is a possibility of a strong winds after November 20 with a very slight possibility of thunder showers in the region. This may improve the air quality,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, IMD The Union earth sciences ministry’s forecasting body, SAFAR, excepts the air to improve. “The AQI is likely to improve, but remain the same for the next two days. The local surface winds are low and the mixing layer height is about 1km, resulting in poor ventilation of near surface pollutants. From November 20 onward, the surface winds are likely to be strong, leading to effective dispersion of pollutants that improves air quality,” said SAFAR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/air-quality-a-tad-better-but-still-in-very-poor-zone/articleshow/87767267.cms||Kushagra Dixit

Of these, the average first dose vaccination in eight districts is below 60%. It is above 80% in 13 districts, including Mumbai, Pune, Bhandara, Sindhudurg and Gondia. The state’s average first dose vaccination coverage is 76.01% and it is 37.09% for the second dose, according to the November 15 report of the public health department. A total of 14 districts have registered first dose coverage between 61% and 76%. Eight districts — Hingoli, Nanded, Yavatmal, Akola, Aurangabad, Amravati, Beed and Nandurbar — were marked in red because their first dose beneficiaries ranged from 56% to 60%. Additional chief secretary, health, Dr Pradeep Vyas has directed all the collectors to draw up a plan to ensure 100% vaccination of first dose beneficiaries by November 30. “Now, we have started the Har Ghar Dastak campaign and proactively approaching those yet to get the first dose as well as the beneficiaries who have missed their second dose. We shall attempt to ensure that by November 30 all eligible population receive at least one shot of vaccination,” he told TOI. State public health officials stated that local authorities had been asked to draw up their plans in order to ensure that eligible people were vaccinated at the earliest. “The local authorities, while carrying out the door-to-door campaign, should ensure that all adult beneficiaries have taken the first dose and they should also check for the time of the second dose to ensure that they are vaccinated,” said a senior health official. As on Wednesday, a total of 3.46 crore people have been fully vaccinated in the state. “The low percentage of second dose coverage could be mainly because of the gap in Covishield doses or laxity in taking it. The officials have been asked to keep a track of the second dose beneficiaries and to find out the reason why those due for it have not taken it. They should be persuaded to get a shot and to go to the nearest vaccination centre,” said the official. The state task force members stressed on double vaccination to reduce the severity of the disease and deaths. “Double vaccination and proper ventilation is a mandate that should be followed,” said a task force member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covid-vaccination-rate-below-state-average-in-22-districts/articleshow/87767258.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Save Education Campaign Committee had said that there was an attempt at backdoor appointment in Kannur University and alleged that Varghese didn’t have the minimum eligibility for the post of associate professor being a research degree with eight years’ experience at the assistant professor level. The petition claimed that Priya joined as an assistant professor in Sri Kerala Varma College in 2012 and while working there she had availed three years’ leave under the FDP programme for completing her PhD. They had cited Clause 3.9 of UGC Regulations 2018 to claim that the time taken by candidates to acquire MPhil/PhD degree shall not be considered as teaching/research experience for appointment to the teaching position. Meanwhile, varsity authorities said that Varghese had requisite qualifications for the post. They said that she had conducted research under faculty improvement programme, which is envisaged to provide opportunity to teachers to pursue their academic/research activities and it cannot be considered as a service break. Now the programme has been rechristened as Faculty Development Programme. The varsity had invited applications for appointment for eight associate professor posts and two assistant professor posts on Sept 22 and the last date for submitting application online was Oct 30 and the last date for submitting hard copies was Nov 12. The screening committee meeting was held on Nov 13 and a shortlist of six candidates was prepared. The campaign committee had alleged that the screening procedure was carried out in haste to make the appointment before the end of tenure of the present vice-chancellor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/kannur-university-to-hold-interview-today/articleshow/87767273.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Tope tells collectors to make list of 1st & 2nd shot beneficiaries||Pune: Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday told TOI that all collectors in the state had been directed to check for the first and second dose of anti-Covid vaccine beneficiaries by referring to the election list and persuade citizens to get completely inoculated within the stipulated time. The state is trying to achieve cent-per-cent inoculation of the first dose beneficiaries by November 30. In the wake of the Aurangabad collector issuing strict orders to scale up vaccination and saying people without a single dose of the vaccine will not get petrol or gas, Tope told TOI that he had directed all the collectors to persuade citizens to scale up the inoculation drive through persuasive methods and the Har Ghar Dastak programme. A day after his interaction with Union health minister Mansukh Mandviya, Tope said the state wanted to speed up the vaccinations but the Centre was “not keen” on reducing the gap between the Covishield doses. “We had requested the Centre to reduce the gap to 28 days. But going by the scientific advice, they are not keen and said the current gap of 84 days is ideal,” the state health minister said. Tope said he had even told the government that since it allowed the second dose to be administered within a gap of 28 days to those going abroadf for studies or work, the same arrangement could have been made for all citizens. Tope said the Centre was keen on completing the existing adult vaccination programme first and then discuss the booster doses. The state has sought funds for additional manpower in case of a third wave of the pandemic and urged the Centre to re-start the National Health Mission Scheme. “The Union health minister is willing to discuss the issue,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tope-tells-collectors-to-make-list-of-1st-2nd-shot-beneficiaries/articleshow/87767280.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Delhi||Delhi: How states, NTPC failed to fulfil vows to tackle stubble||NEW DELHI: Neither public sector company NTPC’s plan to procure biomass pellets in adequate quantities, nor the northern states’ assurances to use bio-decomposer in identified areas to deal with paddy stubble could fully achieve their targets, leading to the air pollution crisis in the capital. Officials in the environment ministry who analysed what went wrong with the promises made to it in its September review meeting on the issue noted that the situation could have been much better if Punjab and Haryana and the National Thermal Power Corporation had worked as per their respective plans to deal with crop residue. “NTPC had promised us under their existing plan to use 20 million tonnes of stubble for four years. But it could manage only around 3.5 million tonnes. It’s a big let down. We were banking on the public sector entity to deal with the situation to an extent,” said an official. He said the states “told us that they, along with private companies, would help farmers use IARI’s Pusa bio-decomposer in over 16 lakh acres of paddy-grown areas free of cost. Even that could not happen. Only half of what they promised has been covered so far.” NTPC has, however, reasons for being short on targets as, officials said, the issue is on the supply side and not on the demand side. None of the stubble-burning states have invested in or incentivised setting up of units for making pellets from farm residue resulting in a dearth of pellets. Company executives said it has received only 58,000 tonnes of pellets against orders for 9.5 lakh tonnes of pellets. "NTPC has been running sustained ad campaigns in the catchment states to encourage and promote setting up of pellet-making units and their benefits to farmers but that hasn't improved supply. We are again launching a campaign to promote pellet-making," a senior company executive said. The policy of using farm residue pellets in NTPC's power plants was announced on November 16, 2017. An acre of cropping yields about two tonnes of stubble or straw. A tonne of stubble fetches Rs 5,500, which yields an additional income of about Rs 11,000 per acre for farmers. Ash generated from burning of agro residue-based fuel in power plants gets absorbed in electrostatic precipitators and does not cause air pollution. Also, the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide emitted from their combustion is absorbed in the next crop cycle by photosynthesis, which does not increase the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-states-ntpc-failed-to-fulfil-vows-to-tackle-stubble/articleshow/87767306.cms||Vishwa Mohan

Dr Pallavi said it has been observed that many children are deprived of mother's milk which is considered as elixir of life. Hence, the milk bank will be set up here. The total cost of the bank is $77,000 dollars of which $15,000 dollars is donated by the Karnataka Vikas Grameen Bank and the remaining amount is funded by Rotary Club Seven Hills and some clubs in USA. Pasteurization machines have been imported from Sweden as the milk donated by the lactating mothers should be stored in minus 30 degrees Celsius. SDM hospital has donated the space for setting up the milk bank and this will cater to the needs to both urban and rural babies requiring mother's milk. It has also been decided to open a satellite centre at Civil Hospital. Mother's milk will be offered free of cost to needy babies, Dr Pallavi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/sdm-hospital-in-dharwad-to-set-up-milk-bank-to-help-needy-babies/articleshow/87765528.cms||GURURAJ JAMKHANDI

The paddy ruin has adversely affected farmers in the seven villages of Vadgaon, Shahpur, Angol, Yellur, Dhamni, Halaga and Mahavapura. Besides the water damaging 50 per cent of the standing crop, half of the post-harvest paddy kept in the fields for threshing were washed away, dashing farmers’ hopes of earning from them, the agriculture department has said. The farmers have demanded compensation from the government. Farmer Raju M said the water from the Rajahansgad hillock area flows down into Ballari Nala (channel). However due to development activity like roads and buildings, the water entered arable land. On Tuesday, there was no clue about the heavy rainfall, otherwise the farmers would have made arrangements to protect their produce, he said. Raju further said that the Halaga-Macche bypass construction was a big blow to farmers as it obstructed the flow of water and this was inundating fields in surrounding areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/untimely-heavy-rain-destroys-paddy-in-seven-belagavi-villages/articleshow/87765498.cms||---

The authorities said that the project aims at documenting the species available there and also to provide information to the public regarding the plants available in the complex. The plants showcased in the assembly complex have been assigned a placard defining the plant. The placard also contains a QR code which can be scanned by the people to get all types of information regarding the plant featured in the website. The website features about 252 species from the assembly complex. Around 50 varieties are yet to be uploaded. The QR code was developed with the help of Dr A Ganga Prasad, head of the department of Botany, Karyavattom campus, and Akhilesh S P Nair, a botany research student. The IT department of the legislative assembly has identified the plants and gathered all the detailed information about each plant. Later the department uploaded the details of the plants, including the pictures. The budget for the program was around Rs 50,000. The assembly complex is also renowned for its organic farming. It also has a “thulaseevanam” (Tulsi garden) and “kadalivanam” (banana garden). The authorities are now planning to soon launch a butterfly garden. “The digital garden was launched to document the collection of flora in the assembly complex. As part of the documentation, we are also planning to publish a book which defines all the species available in the complex,” said S V Unnikrishnan Nair, secretary of legislative assembly complex.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/assembly-garden-gets-a-digital-version/articleshow/87744798.cms||---

Cyberabad police said that they arrested Rasheed Ali, Yasin Khan and Ifthekar Ahmed as they were supplying MDMA from Mumbai to Hyderabad. On November 12, police had arrested Mohammed bin Hassan, a realtor and a resident of Charminar, and K Rakesh, a software professional from Lakdikapul, at Madhapur as they were in possession of 3gm of MDMA. Based on their confession about the role of three persons, who supplied the drug to them, police tracked them and nabbed them at the Hitech City railway station. Police seized 45 gm of MDMA, four mobile phones, a car and ₹16,000 cash from their possession. One Raju Bhai of Mumbai had reportedly sent the drug to Hyderabad through Yasin Khan. “We found that Mohammed bin Hassan was addicted to drugs and he frequently visits Mumbai to purchase narcotic substance from Ifthekar,’‘ Cyberabad police commissioner Stephen Raveendra said. In February, Ifthekar and Salman were arrested by the Nampally police for violation of NDPS Act.

The interim order was given by a bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A Rajashekher Reddy while hearing separate petitions against these allotments. Appearing for the petitioners, senior counsel S Satyam Reddy accused the state of being whimsical and not following any procedure. “The state is not the owner. The state is only a trustee of these plots. People are real owners. State cannot dole it out to undeserving entities,” Satyam Reddy said, citing the case of two richest communities being given 5 acre plot each in the heart of Hi-Tec city. “If the state puts these plots for auction, it would get Rs 1,000 crore,” he said. Satyam Reddy pointed out that a rich businessman from one of the two communities even gave a blank cheque to raise a palace in the plot to serve as an association building. “This shows the economic status of the community and the state is doling out precious land for a pittance to such entities. There are 792 communities in the state, will the state give similar largesse to all of them?” he asked. State’s special counsel A Santhosh Kumar claimed that the state has a policy to allot plots to various communities who have begun constructions. The bench sought counters from the state. It however refused to stay the constructions. “All constructions will be subject to the judgment we deliver in the current pleas,” the bench said. case will come up again on January 3, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-to-decide-fateof-bldgs-on-landfor-caste-groups/articleshow/87767289.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

He also denied allegations by Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis that the rallies were carried out with the support of the state government. “These were self-declared rallies and protests in which people participated or were made to participate and different groups provoked each other,” Walse Patil told a television channel. He said that he did not agree with Fadnavis’s statement but adding that “if the Opposition has any information they want to give, we will examine it”. Walse Patil further said that this was not the time for anyone to make provocative statements. This week, the police arrested several BJP leaders, including former minister Anil Bonde, inconnection with the rioting in Amravati. When asked if the state government would actagainst political leaders even from the ruling party or the Raza Academy, if found guilty, Walse Patil said, “We will act against those found guilty even if they are leaders from political parties or from any organization.” When asked whether the state government had any idea about the whereabouts of former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh who has been declared absconding, the home minister said, “I can’t tell you anything at this time.” Walse Patil added that the fact that Singh has declared that he had no proof to back his allegations of corruption against former home minister Anil Deshmukh shows that he made the allegations only to defame the MVA government. When asked whether Mumbai Police would act against NCB zonal director Samir Wankhede who is under acloud after the arrest of actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan in the cruise drug bust case, he said, “The police are doing their work. It not be appropriate for me to comment.” Walse Patil said the Centre was using its agencies to create pressure on the MVA government, but it would remain strong and complete its term. “Central agencies are being used even in small cases. This is a little too much. The MVA government is strong and will complete its term. The three parties will remain together even in the future,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/protest-rallies-self-declared-no-state-support-in-mumbai-home-min/articleshow/87768393.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

The November chill, as a result, was likely to be missing from the city for another five to seven days, a senior official from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) told TOI on Wednesday. On Tuesday, November rain lashed several parts of the city, causing instances of power outage. The rain amounts were, however, in single digit in most places. Shivajinagar had received 7.4mm rain, Lohegaon 9.4mm, Pashan 9.2mm, Chinchwad 15mm, Lavale 4.5 mm and Magarpatta got 5mm. Senior IMD scientist K S Hosalikar, also head of surface instruments division at the Climate Research and Services, IMD, Pune, told TOI, “November rains are not unusual though unexpected as per long-term climatological data. Generally, the southwest monsoon withdraws from the country by mid-October. October is part of the post-monsoon season, which is also the cyclone season. It is thus a favorable period for the formation of low-pressure systems over the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal.” These low pressure systems could then intensify into more intense systems such as well-marked low pressure areas or depressions, he said. “If these systems over the oceans are closer to the land area, they give rain. With the northeast monsoon also being active, various systems can cause moisture incursion over parts of South peninsular India, as well as Maharashtra, aiding the rainfall,” said Hosalikar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rain-likely-to-continue-for-2-3-days-wait-for-november-chill-gets-longer/articleshow/87767290.cms||Neha Madaan

The CoWIN data revealed that the average daily vaccination for the second dose remained in the range of 25,000 to 28,000 from November 7 to November 17. Between 8,000 and 10,000 first doses were administered per day in the same duration. The data revealed that on November 13, around 37,507 beneficiaries were vaccinated with the second dose — the highest in the past 10 days. A total of 34,101 second doses were administered on November 15 and 31,198 doses on November 12. An official from the public health services, Pune circle, said around nine lakh beneficiaries were eligible for the second dose of Covishield and about one lakh were eligible for the second shot of Covaxin on November 1. As the vaccination centres were closed during the Diwali holidays, the second dose vaccination picked up the pace post-Diwali. The official said the record vaccination of Covishield in September would also result in an increased number of eligible beneficiaries for the second dose in November and December. The second dose of Covishield needs to be administered between the 12th and 16th week from the date of the first dose. The district health department officials stated that the vaccination in rural Pune, lagging in the district, would get the much necessary boost through the “Har Ghar Dastak” drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/second-dose-vax-picks-up-pace-post-diwali/articleshow/87767291.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The agency plans to take up the matter with social media websites and hosting platforms — widely used in this case to circulate the explicit materials — and examine their role and liability, an official said. Earlier, the agency had made arrests in the case following registration of 23 FIRs on November 14 and country-wide raids on Tuesday. The arrested men claimed that the obscene content was uploaded by them on certain websites and the URLs were then shared in chat groups. The hosts received payments on the basis of the number of views on the materials. Initial probe suggested that there are over 50 groups with over 5,000 offenders where child sexual abuse material are shared. These include foreign nationals from nearly 100 countries. The CBI has also zeroed in on around 31 suspects from Bangladesh, 28 from Nigeria, 30 from Sri Lanka, 27 from Azerbaijan and 24 from Yemen, said sources. “The CBI plans to coordinate with various foreign law enforcement agencies for further action...,” an agency spokesperson said. Investigators had earlier confirmed that some individuals were involved in trading child abuse material for monetary benefits. During searches of electronic gadgets like mobiles and laptops, it was revealed that several people were commercially disseminating explicit material by sharing links, videos, pictures, texts, posts and hosting such content on social media and third-party platforms, an official said. “Money trail is being followed to work out the linkages of the offenders,” said the source. The agency also plans to coordinate with the International Child Sexual Exploitation Database for comparing the child sexual abuse images and trace their origin. As per the Interpol, an estimated 2.4 million instances of online child sexual abuse were reported from India from 2017 to 2020, CBI sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/us-pakistan-residents-in-child-porn-racket/articleshow/87768902.cms||Raj Sekhar
---||Hyderabad||Shooters take aim at state forpoor infra at range in HCU||Hyderabad: Telangana Rifle Association (TRA) members cried foul over lack of facilities at the Sports Authority of Telangana State (SATS) shooting range on HCU campus in Gachibowli. Since the state government does not allot funds for maintenance of the range, members of TRA and the Indian Rifle Association have pooled money for essential works. Despite SATS claiming that electronic target systems have been installed at the shooting range, aspiring and renowned shooters allege that half of the range is still manual. Seniors mostly practise at trap and skeet ranges. Saber Ali Khan, a doctor and well-known shooter, said there was an urgent need for upgrading the facilities at the SATS shooting range as per the standards of International Shooting Sport Federation. “We are lagging behind states like Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat. There is a big disparity between funding they get and what we get here. There is zero money for the shooting range from the state,” he said. Shooter A Ansari, who is a member of TRA and NRA, said the government should step in and provide more support to the shooting range. “We have seen kids coming here and turning into Olympians. Quality infrastructure is the need of the hour,” he said. Shooters said there was no problem as far as licensing from police is concerned, but the renewals were taking six months. Saber Ali said it takes just one day for renewal in Delhi. “We import ammunition from abroad once in two years. Currently, we have two trap ranges and two skeet ranges for conducting nationals. We need at least five ranges.” Sports minister V Srinivas Goud promised to improve the facilities. “We have given half of the facility to shooter Gagan Narang. Rest of it is with us. We will make efforts to scale up the facilities,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/shooters-take-aim-at-state-forpoor-infra-at-range-in-hcu/articleshow/87767304.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

IFFK was held in four locations and the schedule was revised as a five day festival in five theatres in respective locations. Festival followers had regarded the decision as a move to take IFFK away from Trivandrum.

---||Delhi||New excise policy day 1: Many tipplers in Delhi left high and dry||NEW DELHI: It was largely a dry day in the city on Wednesday when it should have been a day of rejoicing with a plentiful of liquor brands available in spacious stores. But only a handful of private retailers began their new foray into alcohol retail after Delhi government quit the business and its 650 vends or so pulled down the shutters. Drink connoisseurs could be seen running around from one location to another searching for their preferred brand, but in vain. TimesViewThe new excise policy is forward-thinking. It will benefit customers and increase revenue collection. The money, in turn, should be used judiciously for public welfare projects.The new excise policy has put alcohol sales in the hands of private retailers who are required to arrange spacious liquor stores and stock an array of offerings. But on the first day of the policy implementation on Wednesday, many buyers, like Shekhar Ranjan, were left disappointed. “It feels like a dry day. I have checked a couple of liquor shops in Mayur Vihar but they didn’t have stocks,” said Ranjan outside a liquor store at a Mayur Vihar mall. A liquor store in Dwarka opened on Wednesday but the shelves in the swanky store were empty. “Many customers turned up but returned empty handed. We have placed orders for liquor, but they are yet to be delivered,” said the store manager. It was similar across the city. The authorities had promised a smooth transition from the old excise policy to the new to prevent an alcohol scarcity, but the first day of the new regime was marked by chaos. The tiny old vends are to give way to spacious stores stocking all brands in airconditioned environs. The new shops are unlikely to appear crowded because there is adequate space inside for the customers to amble around exploring what to buy. There will be 850 new showroom-like liquor stores across the city under the new excise policy. The policy has also divided Delhi into 32 liquor zones. Each zone comprising 8-10 municipal wards will have 27 liquor stores, ensuring equal distribution of alcohol retailers in the capital. Excise commissioner Arava Gopi Krishna did not reply to TOI’s messages seeking clarity on the prevailing situation. A government official disclosed that provisional licences have been given to over 350 shops, 206 brands have been registered and 10 wholesale licensees have begun procuring over 9 lakh litres of liquor of various brands. While industry watchers expect prices to go up by around 10%, the government has countered that with liquor shops permitted to offer discounts, any rise in prices would be neutralised by such rate markdowns. Liquor traders said that since many of the shops are just getting ready and are getting interiors designing and furniture work completed, it might take some days for the city’s tipplers to shout, “Cheers!”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/day-1-many-tipplers-left-high-and-dry/articleshow/87767325.cms||AlokKNMishra

In the rural parts of PMR, 78 recovered in the last 24 hours. The daily sample testing increased to 14,256 on Wednesday. More than 5,100 tests were conducted in the PMC limits, while more than 4,500 samples were checked each in the rural pockets and the PCMC areas. The region’s positivity rate stood at 1.8% on Wednesday. So far, more than 84 lakh tests have been conducted in the region. The region’s active caseload reached 2,099 on Wednesday evening. As many as 1,071 patients were in home isolation and remaining were being treated at hospitals. Health officials maintained that people needed to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour like wearing masks and maintaining social distance in spite of getting fully vaccinated. “Taking two doses of vaccine helps in checking infection and its severity. But, breakthrough infections do still occur. People need to exercise caution and abide by the Covid norms,”a health official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/257-test-ve-in-pmr-192-recover-four-more-dead/articleshow/87767315.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Chennai||Without witness protection, justice hangs in the balance||CHENNAI: The film ‘Jai Bhim’ on police atrocity on a tribal family has brought back the public gaze to custodial torture and violence and the mechanisms of the state enforcement machinery. The recent judgment of the special court, Cuddalore, in the murder of the inter-caste couple Kannagi and Murugesan, who were killed by the former's family because Murugesan was a dalit, recapitulates the workings of the police force. The court in this case convicted the 11 family members and two police personnel (then inspector and the sub-inspector) who were hand-in-glove with the perpetrators of the dual murders. Police were found to have fabricated documents, intimidated witnesses, tampered with evidence and foisted false cases against the innocent. Justice prevailed after 18 years due to the perseverance of human rights lawyers and activists, who supported victims and ensured their safety during the trial and thereafter. Witnesses and victims were not given protection by the state, resulting in 36 of the 81 prosecution witnesses turning ‘hostile’ during the trial. The state’s obligation to uphold human rights includes witness protection and assistance. The witness protection scheme adopted and declared to be the law by the Supreme Court on December 6, 2018, is the sole programme that governs the rights of a witness to provide testimony before investigative and enforcement agencies without reprisal. The Union government finalised the scheme in consultation with states and the National Legal Services Authority. The scheme has laudable objectives, but with fallacious procedures and substance, it fails to safeguard the witness and victim during investigation, trial and thereafter. The competent authority (comprising district judge, head of police and head of prosecution in the district) passes the witness protection order based on the threat analysis report (TAR) prepared by the head of the police of the police subdivision concerned. A maximum of three months of protection for the witness and absence of penalty for breach in confidentiality concerning witness details does not repose faith in the scheme. The nexus between police and high-profile offenders appears entrenched within the system, leaving the witness and the victim without a remedy. When impunity prevails the perpetrators become emboldened to threaten and inflict violence on victims and witnesses. The Supreme Court observed in a multitude of cases that "criminal case is built on the edifice of evidence and for that witness is required" and has rued about the absence of statutory protection for witnesses and victims of abuses and violence. In the case of Zahira Habibullah Sheikh vs State of Gujarat (2004), the top court called for "legislative measures to emphasise prohibition against tampering with witness, victim or informant". The Law Commission reports have been a useful resource in guiding the courts on witness protection, particularly the 172 Report (2000) on ‘Review of Rape Laws’ prepared on the direction of the Supreme Court in Sakshi vs Union of India (2004). The judgment in the case ensured that witnesses and victims of child sex abuse and rape are separated by a screen from the accused, for them to depose without fear. Lack of a legislative framework for maintaining anonymity of witnesses and for their protection has often led to witnesses turning ‘hostile’. The Constitution guarantees to the accused the fundamental right to a fair trial, but the right needs to strike a balance with the right of the victim and the witness for protection against recrimination. The Indian Evidence Act offers minimalist protection to victims and witnesses that confine them against being asked scandalous questions and the Indian Penal Code under a 2006 amendment penalises criminal intimidation of witnesses. Two bills on the protection of the identity of witnesses and witness protection were introduced in Parliament but they could not metamorphose into a statute. Witness protection is in the national limelight as the Supreme Court has directed the Uttar Pradesh government to grant protection to the witnesses of the Lakhimpur Kheri violence that claimed the lives of protesting farmers, after having been allegedly mowed down by a convoy of the son of a Union minister. The court expressed surprise at the restraint shown by witnesses to depose on the violence that had a gathering of hundreds of protesters, reinforcing that the witness protection scheme needs re-examination. Considering the recurrent phenomenon of witnesses fearing to provide testimony, the Union government should conduct an audit and revamp the scheme, until a comprehensive law is enacted. While doing so, both mechanisms of witness protection and witness assistance, which includes financial, medical, material, psychological and social support to victims and witnesses, need to be incorporated. Basic principles for a witness protection programme that include independence, neutrality and inclusivity should feature in the new scheme. The investigative machinery must be separate from protection mechanisms to avoid compromising sensitive information or using protection as leverage in exchange for information. The revamped scheme and the new law could draw from best practices from across the world, specifically the Philippines and South Africa that have placed witness protection and assistance in a centralised agency. Witnesses, after all, are "the eyes and ears of justice".

This is a question that Bordeaux-based artist Emmanuelle Leblanc examines and tries to answer through ‘Shine!’, a project that studies female presence through installation of large portraits at city’s public places. From November 18 to December 19, Leblanc’s work will be on display at the State Art Gallery, KBR Park and elsewhere in the city as part of Indian Photo Festival. Produced from digitally enhanced photographs, the larger-than-life portraits explore identities and span generations. The models are both Indian and European but are united in their embodiment of an independent, strong or resilient position. Leblanc’s work draws on Colour Field movement that uses expressive power of colour to make possible a new way to experience space. Leblanc’s project follows an experiment in 2014 in Vitry-sur-Seine in France as part of International Women’s Day. It is a development of work started by her during a residency in Hyderabad in 2019. Project is a collaboration between Alliance Francaise of Hyderabad, Bordeaux Metropole, French Institute in Paris and French Institute in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/artists-vision-places-women-at-centrestage-of-public-space/articleshow/87767311.cms||---

MSF state president PK Navas said in a news conference on Wednesday that the college principal made a second year degree student touch her feet thrice after summoning him to her office saying that she had received a complaint against him. He also showed a photograph of the student touching the feet of the principal. Meanwhile, the principal said that she had informed the police about the bid to attack her and the police had collected a fine from the student for not wearing a face mask and the police had told her that they would take action if she gave a written complaint. “When I came back to my office I had received a lot of phone calls saying that the student was ready to apologize and touch my feet and that I should forgive him.

---||Pune||Experts want wards of high-risk parents on priority list too||Pune: Children of comorbid parents should also be prioritised for Covid vaccination, besides kids having comorbidities, to prevent the transmission of infection from children to their high-risk parents or grandparents at home, experts underlined. “It is true that when we vaccinate children of high-risk parents, it will prevent the transmission of infection from children to their high-risk parents/grandparents. Therefore, after vaccination of high-risk children, the next priority should be the immunization of children of high-risk parents,” said senior paediatrician Pramod Jog, a member of the state’s paediatric Covid task force. The state’s paediatric task force last week submitted its views to the government to preferentially vaccinate children with underlying medical conditions like obesity and others. The demand to vaccinate children of high-risk parents started after it. “Vaccination of children of high-risk parents with underlying medical conditions would help prevention of transmission to older age groups and high-risk household members,” said Sanjay Patil, the chairman of the Indian Medical Association's Hospital Board of India (HBI), Pune chapter. The two Covid vaccines — ZyCoV-D and Covaxin — are to be introduced under the country’s Covid immunization programme by December-end. Evidence suggests that kids with medical complexity can be at an increased risk. Stress on school attendance The Covid vaccines would not be available to healthy kids initially. About seven-eight months may be needed for inoculation of all the children. Hence, schooling should not be withheld for such a long period, experts stressed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-want-wards-of-high-risk-parents-on-priority-list-too/articleshow/87767344.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The RHB not only developed permanent shops for Tibetans, but also earned a revenue of Rs 22 crore from the market, which was redundant. At the inauguration, urban development and housing (UDH) minister Shanti Dhariwal said, “The previous government developed this market without planning and it was not utilised. The RHB commissioner not only gave a fresh lease to the market, but also earned revenue for the board after 13 years.”RHB commissioner Pawan Arora said, “At the RHB board meeting, it was decided to allot 266 shops to Tibetan Refugee Hosiery Readymade Seller Union by lottery. These shops were allotted at the reserve price of 2014-15. While the ground floor shops have been allotted for Rs 8.60 lakh, the basement and first floors were given for Rs 5.57 lakh. The allottees can pay the amount in installments for 5 years.”In 2003, when Operation Pink was started by the state government, a survey was conducted by Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) for the construction of permanent shops to rehabilitate of makeshift shopowners. On the basis the survey report, the planning of Jhulelal Market was done for rehabilitation of these makeshift shopowners. In all, 355 eligible applicants registered to buy shops in this market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rhb-earns-rs-22cr-after-selling-266-shops-in-jhulelal-market/articleshow/87768080.cms||---
---||Nagpur||‘Nevale’s demise a big loss to Vid statehood movement’||Nagpur: One of the pioneers of Vidarbha statehood movement, Ram Nevale, breathed his last in the early hours of Wednesday. The 74-year-old was a stalwart in the pro-statehood agitations, with decades of grassroots connect and knowledge of what ails the Vidarbha farming community. Former state attorney general Shreehari Aney said, “I am saddened by this news. He was a great fighter and a genuine human being who loved Vidarbha passionately. He was one of those few leaders who knew Vidarbha’s grassroots. The loss is irreplaceable.” Starting off as a farmers’ leader in the 80s, Nevale was associated with late veteran Sharad Joshi and his Shetkari Sanghatna. As the years went by, Nevale got more and more involved with the separate Vidarbha cause as he felt that was the only way to bring the region out of its backwardness. His Vidarbha Rajya Andolan Samiti (VRAS) worked tirelessly to create awareness and even fight for justice for the region and its farmers. It was just over two months ago that Rambhau, as he was fondly called, threw his hat in the political ring by launching the Jai Vidarbha Party (JVP). Registering the party in September this year, Nevale’s plan was to field candidates for the upcoming municipal corporation polls. Sandesh Singalkar, a staunch Vidarbha statehood supporter, said, “Rambhau was a 24/7 Vidarbha statehood activist. He had dedicated his life completely to the movement. I spoke to him just last week and he was talking about some plans for the civic polls. It’s absolutely shocking that our generation won’t have his guidance anymore.” Nitin Ronghe, convener of Mahavidarbha Janjagaran, said, “It’s a big blow to the movement as he was a great support to all of us. We had different views with him regarding Vidarbha Statutory Development Board but we were on the same page that there is no alternative to separate Vidarbha state.” Tejinder Singh Renu, a statehood proponent, said, “It’s a loss because political pressure is very much needed when fighting for such a cause. And Rambhau was a stalwart whose presence espoused confidence in others who also believe in statehood.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nevales-demise-a-big-loss-to-vid-statehood-movement/articleshow/87767342.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

STR field director RN Meena said, “There are a total of 18 families in the village. The remaining will be shifted within two months.”The forest administration’s efforts to educate villagers in recent past have started yielding efforts as more villages are coming forward to move out of the forest. “Shifting of two more villages is in the pipeline. Recently, the head of forest forces (HoFF), DN Pandey, also inspected the areas, where villagers were shifted,” said an official.Most of the families that had shifted opted for land packages. The package includes 6 bighas of agricultural land, a 60 x 90 square-feet plot and an electric connection for agriculture. “The families of Sukola village will be rehabilitated in Tijara. The villagers, who moved out earlier have witnessed an increase in land value here,” said a district administration official.Once the village is entirely razed, the area can be occupied by the big cats, including male ST-13, tigresses ST-14 and ST- 17 and ST-20. As per records, there were 26 villages in the CTH proposed to be relocated which are said to be violating the tiger habitat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sariska-officials-to-relocate-4th-village-to-expand-tiger-habitat/articleshow/87768089.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Raut hits back at Fadnavis for barb against CM Thackeray||Mumbai: It is a good thing that all citizens in Maharashtra consider themselves to be the chief minister, unlike the ministers and MPs in the Modi governm-ent at the Centre, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said on Wednesday. Hitting back at the BJP and opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis’s comments that no one in the state was ready to accept Thackeray as CM and that the MVA government has no existence, Raut said. “Ever since Thackeray took over the reins of the state, 11 crore people think that they are the CM...This is a big thing in a democracy. No minister in the Modi government thinks he is a minister. I don’t think even MPs think that they are MPs.” Taking a dig at Fadnavis, who had said there was no rule of law in the state, he said, “Maharashtra used to be a state whi-ch used to ‘give’ to the ruling pa-rty. The rule of law came two years ago. I can understand the pain of those who are out of power and not getting anything now.” The Sena blamed ‘fake Hindutvawadis’ for the violence in Amravati, saying communal tensions were stoked for political mileage ahead of UP assembly polls. Raut said: “If you heard the CM’s Dussehra rally speech, he had made it clear that the real danger was from fake Hindutvawadis. They bring up Hindu-Muslim and India-Pakistan issues when polls are near...They intend communal tension...We all know who these people are.” —Chaitanya Marpakwar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-raut-hits-back-at-fadnavis-for-barb-against-cm-thackeray/articleshow/87768405.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Virus lingers on in ‘dead’ zones like basins, corners: IIT-Bombay study||MUMBAI: Infectious aerosols can linger in the air up to 10 times longer in “dead zones” in enclosed spaces. Slow air circulation in these dead zones —areas above washbasins in washrooms, behind doors, corners and around furniture— can be a potential source of Covid infection transmission, a team of researchers from IIT Bombay (IIT-B) has found. This finding holds more significance now as an increasing number of public places, including restaurants, theatres, malls, and schools and colleges, are being opened up. The team studied air flow in a public washroom to arrive at the conclusion. “Ideally, air in a room should be continuously replaced with fresh air for proper ventilation, but it gets trapped in areas behind the door, in corners, around furniture or behind some obstacle. While windows, fans, air conditioners and exhaust fans keep most parts of a room properly ventilated, in these dead zones, the air gets trapped and keeps going in a circular motion. Technically, these are called recirculation zones. These zones were identified using computer simulation for the study,” said professor Krishnendu Sinha from the department of aerospace engineering at IIT-B. The researchers were motivated to study how air flow could be managed better in closed rooms. Using computer simulation, the researchers have demonstrated the importance of proper ventilation in closed rooms to mitigate Covid transmission. For their study, they created a computer model of the washroom and found that the area above the washbasin was found to be a dead zone. “The ventilation systems are often designed keeping in mind the air changes per hour (ACH) value. This is assuming every corner is getting fresh air, but our simulations have shown us that some corners do not get fresh air as quickly as other open parts. If infected people are using it, then it is important to pump in fresh air swiftly in these zones,” said Sinha. Chances of infection are significantly higher in these dead zones as infectious aerosols (after the washroom is used by a Covid-infected person) can linger up to 10 times longer as compared to other well-ventilated parts of the room, the team found. The study titled ‘Effects of Recirculation Zones on the Ventilation of a Public Washroom’ co-authored by Sinha, Mani Shankar Yadav, Utkarsh Verma and Janani S Murallidharan from IIT-B and Vivek Kumar (from a Pune-based firm) was published in the journal Physics of Fluids on November 2. They have recommended using additional fans or ducts facing the dead zones to mitigate the spread of infection. Using fans can help ventilate dead zones. In their experiment, they found keeping a washroom door partially open, facing the basin, could be helpful too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/virus-lingers-on-in-dead-zones-like-basins-corners-iit-bombay-study/articleshow/87767359.cms||Yogita Rao

The police identified the accused as Anilkumar of Injavila near Thrikkaruva. He had allegedly caused critical injuries to his sister Anitha by stabbing her using a knife during a quarrel. The police said that the incident related to the case took place a day ago. Anilkumar had a personal dispute with Anitha's son. This dispute had caused a rift between the two siblings. On the day of the alleged crime, Anilkumar turned up at Anitha's residence and picked up a quarrel with her son. This spat soon intensified and both men broke into a fist fight. Anitha intervened to stop the fight. But, Anilkumar grabbed a knife he was carrying and stabbed her. She was first rushed to a private hospital nearby and then to Kollam district government hospital. From there, she was referred to the medical college hospital here. The accused was caught by a team led by Anchalummood station house officer inspector C Devarajan from a relative's house where he was hiding. Shortly after the arrest, the accused was produced before the court and remanded in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/man-held-for-stabbing-sister/articleshow/87744860.cms||---
---||Pune||Researchers identify novel mosquito repelling molecule||Pune: A team from the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research’s (CSIR) National Chemical Laboratory recently conducted a research on a novel mosquito repellent via the silicon switch approach, where 25 compounds were synthesized. It was found that one molecule offered longer protection time than DEET, considered a gold standard for insect repellent. The NCL researchers synthesised this novel molecule,which was found to be an effective repellent on the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which are causes of fatal diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika virus. The team found several compounds from this series appeared to possess good mosquito-repellent properties. Most notably, the mean protection time for the molecule NDS100100 was 756 minutes, which was higher than that of DEET (616 minutes). The team was led by Dr. D. S. Reddy, who is the director of CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu. The team included Akshay S. Kulkarni, Remya Ramesh, Safal Walia, Shahebaz I. Sayyad and Awvalokiteswar Sen. The research was published on November 12 in the journal — American Chemical Society Omega. Reddy said, “Mosquito control by personal protection is an efficient way of curtailing deadly diseases. DEET has been in use as a repellent for over 75 years and is a gold standard.” Sen said, “DEET is a viscous, oily substance . It is a skin irritant and can sometimes cause severe epidermal reactions. In view of these limitations, there is an urgent need to develop repellents that are safer and longer-lasting. Our studies indicated that NDS100100 appeared to possess the potential to be developed as an effective mosquito repellent.” “The molecule needs to undergo several studies before it reaches the market. Discussions are on with leading companies to take this forward for further studies towards commercialization,” Sen added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/researchers-identify-novel-mosquito-repelling-molecule/articleshow/87767354.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

There are hospitals, schools and religious institutions in the close range of the proposed store. We have written to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and health minister Satyendar Jain,” said Mahavir Singh Dahiya, president of Rohini B Block Residents Welfare Association that caters to around 300 families. The association had held a protest at the proposed site. According to Dahiya, the shop is being planned at a shopping centre in an area that has three private hospitals, which have also written to the government opposing the move. “Just across the road, we have a Shiv temple and Bhagwan Parshuram Bhawan where religious ceremonies take place,” he added. “Our society will not remain safe, we will have to deploy additional security guards.” Narayan Dutt Lakhera, president of the Sector 2 RWA, claimed that the shop would lead to drinking in nearby parks. “This is a residential area; I will fear sending my children out to play. There will also be a huge rush because of this liquor store,” he added. Manish Chaudhary, councillor of south corporation ward 26, said he had written to the excise department about the residents’ concerns. “We are with the residents. This is a residential area. If the government does not respond, we will sit on protest outside the proposed shop,” he added. “A liquor store should only be in commercial areas. This is a major flaw in the excise policy,” demanded Narendra Chawla, a councillor from Janakpuri that has also protested against the move.

The two havildars had taken the original call letter of a candidate, who cleared his Army Ordnance Corps’ examination for multi-tasking staff (MTS) post, on the pretext of early joining formalities and demanded Rs2.5 lakh from him. The CBI said in a release that the two havildars agreed to collect Rs50,000 as an initial payment and even received Rs30,000 through a UPI payment app. A CBI court on Wednesday remanded the two havildars in police custody for five days. The Army Southern Command later issued a press release through the defence PRO stating, “The Indian Army continues with its policy of zero tolerance for corruption. On a recent tip-off about likely malpractice in recruitment of Multi Tasking Assistance/Staff, the Indian Army in Southern Command and CBI in joint investigation are inquiring into the possible malpractices by lower level staff. The army has strict rules to deal with such malpractices and is enabling expeditious investigation to ensure punitive action against the culprits.” In the other case, a civilian gazetted officer of the IAF demanded Rs50,000 and was caught while accepting Rs4,000 from the complainant for considering his mutual transfer request to Dehu Road. He was remanded in two-day police custody. The arrested suspect was produced before the special CBI court, which ordered his remand in police custody for two days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cbi-traps-2-army-havildars-civilian-gazetted-officer/articleshow/87767350.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Jaipur||Enrolment of students in govt schools rose by 11% during pandemic: Report||JAIPUR: The pandemic has brought major gains for government schools in terms of enrolment. It has jumped from 56.7% in 2020 to 68.4% in 2021, says the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) tabled on Wednesday. The report indicates that the rise of 11% in enrolments was due to the shifting of students from private to government schools and the return of migrants. The rise also indicates that government schools have improved on two fronts: the quality of education and infrastructure. Over the years, the state had introduced several categories of specialised schools — Mahatma Gandhi English Medium Schools, Vivekanand Model School, Utkarsh, Adarsh and general schools. Girdhar Singh, principal of a government school in Malpura said, “My senior secondary school is running full capacity in the past four years. Every year, I can give admission to very selected few purely based on merit in all classes. Most of the transfers in my school are from private schools in some cases, students do come from middle-income level schools.” This school comes under the general category, not any specialised school. Like many others, this school was in a dilapidated condition with dwindling enrolments until a few years ago. The Bhamashah scheme (Donors) have changed the fate of many schools forever. The Malpura school saw a complete overhaul due to generous donations by locals, which have attracted the teachers to stay for long leading to students performing well. The astronomical rise of girl students in government schools, which is exclusive to a few states including Rajasthan, owes it to several reward/award-based schemes linked with it. Pratham NGO managing trustee KB Kothari said, “The cash reward schemes for meritorious students like Gargi Purushkar, financial incentive of Rs 51,000 for girls studying from class I till class 12 in government schools, scooty scheme along with construction of functional toilets in all schools has does the magic for government schools.” Figures say that 73.6% of girls have enrolled in government schools is the highest ever and it comes at a time when in a recent report women have recorded worst literacy rate in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/enrolment-of-students-in-govt-schools-rose-by-11-during-pandemic-report/articleshow/87768098.cms||Shoeb Khan
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Goon attacks elderly couple||Thiruvananthapuram: Kazhakootam police have registered a case and launched a hunt for a habitual offender who allegedly vandalised houses and vehicles of his neighbours at Ulloorkonam near Kazhakootam. The police identified the accused as Hashim, a habitual offender involved in around 20 criminal cases on various offences, including ganja peddling and causing hurt. The attack happened twice, around 9.30 pm on Monday and around 2 am on Tuesday. The main complainant, Shiraz, who is a DYFI activist, said that the accused turned up at his residence first around 9.30 pm and threatened to kill his parents Rashid and Ramla. He even grabbed Ramla by her hair and placed a knife on her throat. Shiraz was not at home at that time. Later, he returned again around 2 am and vandalised three houses in the locality, including that of Shiraz. He also vandalised four two wheelers. The complainant also accused Hashim of stealing cash worth around Rs 10,000 from their poultry shop located outside their residence. Shiraz said that though Hashim might have had the help of other criminals in vandalising the houses at the same time. But, they could only see Hashim in action. The police said Hashim suspected Shiraz of informing police about his activities related to ganja peddling and hence he held a grudge on the former. The police added that Hashim’s house and car also reportedly suffered damages. However, it is unclear whether the damages were caused during a counter attack or whether he caused it himself to file a counter case against the complainants. He is suspected to have fled the district after committing the vandalism.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/goon-attacks-elderly-couple/articleshow/87744869.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Day after: Schools tweak routine, rules for safety of kids, teachers||Kolkata: School authorities are thinking on their feet and tweaking schedules and making changes in their facilities to meet practical needs in the new normal. At Heritage School that has day-boarding, the school authorities have decided to operate the dining hall for students and teachers to have their meals. That is a departure from the practice at most of the other schools where canteens have been shut and parents have been told to pack food for students. While the state government had issued a notification for staggered timing, many schools have modified class timings keeping in mind its infrastructure constraints, student turnout and feedback from parents. At South Point, where more than 1,200 students of IX and XI turned up in two halves on Wednesday, theory and practical classes were held simultaneously. In government and government-aided schools where the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education and Higher Secondary Council had issued staggered timing notices, several schools like Hindu, Hare, Sanskrit Collegiate School, Sakhawat Memorial School and Jodhpur Park Boys School have tweaked the schedule as per their infrastructure, both in terms of classrooms and teachers. Sakhawat Memorial School headmistress Papia Nag said the schedule had announced schools on alternate days for students of classes IX-XII and for classes X-XII to ensure there was no infrastructure hurdle. Jodhpur Park Boys School has also prepared a modified routine comprising a three days a-week, alternate-day schedule for students of classes IX and X. In private English-medium schools in the city, attendance was high. At BDM International where CBSE XII term I board exams for financial marketing management was scheduled on Wednesday, attendance was cent percent as was at South City International and DPS New Town where board mock tests were held. At Heritage School, 90% students of Class IX came on Tuesday. On Wednesday, a similar number reported for Class XI. Students of classes X and XII will come on Thursday. In the international block, there was 100% attendance. At South City International School, there was 100% attendance in Class XII on Tuesday and Class X on Wednesday. Both batches appeared for their mock board exams in the school auditorium. Consent for IX and XI batches is at 70% at the moment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/day-after-schools-tweak-routine-rules-for-safety-of-kids-teachers/articleshow/87766486.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Chennai||Before photographs, these drawings served as visual records||Chennai: Social media is flooded with vintage pictures of temples of south India, but have you chanced upon pre-photography day drawings of these places of worship? A year from now, people may be able to view such unseen drawings on digital platforms, which are now not available in the public domain. It was an effort by the British to document the art and sculpture of temples in the Indian sub-continent more than 120 years ago. The drawings are the oldest image documents recorded during the colonial period, decades before temples were photographed by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), custodian of the centrally protected monuments for the purpose. Now, more than a century later, a proposal is in the works to make the images of the scale drawings public.K Amarnath Ramakrishna, ASI superintendent archaeologist, who heads the temple survey project, southern region, said approval has been sought for the digitisation process. "Plans are on to digitise the drawings. After the nod is given, it will take about a year to complete the whole process. We will be putting out these drawings on digital platforms," he told TOI.The treasure trove comprises popular temples in the south of Vindhyas from Maharashtra to Tamil Nadu. It includes Brihadeeswarar temple at Thanjavur, Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple in Madurai and the Pallava monuments in Mamallapuram. The temple survey project of the southern region, a wing of the ASI, based in Chennai is working on a proposal to conserve about 1,000 such scale drawings through digitisation. Each temple had been recreated in multiple dimensions by special draughtsmen using scale drawings, a few dating back to the 1880s. For instance, the Brihadeeshwarar temple at Thanjavur has at least 25 different drawings in various dimensions and angles, capturing almost every architectural detail of the structure.Similarly, several drawings of the Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple in Madurai give an almost-photographic impression of the structure. The wooden doors and sculptures in the Thousand Pillar mandapam from the temple are masterpieces of precision and intricacy.Some of these are big drawings measuring 84x118cm. The sketches are a record of every minute detail regarding the heritage structures including its height.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/before-photographs-these-drawings-served-as-visual-records/articleshow/87767355.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 5 of six vax laggard districts in state better dose coverage within 15 days||Mumbai: Five of the six districts that were pulled up for low first-dose coverage by the Centre have managed to better their performance in the past 15 days. Barring Nandurbar, five districts have managed to give first shots to 60% of their population. However, the single-dose coverage for all continues to be much below the state average (76.7%). The Centre had identified 48 districts in the country that had not vaccinated even 50% of their eligible population with a single shot till October end. Aurangabad (46.5%), Nandurbar (46.9%), Buldhana (47.6%), Hingoli (47.8%), Nanded (48.4%) and Akola (49.3%) had featured on the list. Later, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had met with the district collectors and told them to increase the pace of coverage. Latest data from CoWin showed that till Wednesday, Aurangabad has vaccinated 60.5% with a single shot, Buldhana 64.3%, Hingoli 61.8%, Nanded 61% and Akola 60.4%. Buldhana has been the swiftest, increasing its coverage by 17% in the past 15 days. A district official said that entire Vidarbha region, including Buldhana, has seen a jump in vaccinations due to a slew of measures including restricted entry to official premises, use of public transport, availing of government schemes for the unvaccinated. “Last week, we had vaccinated more than 40,000 on as single day,” the official said. Nandurbar, with a predominant tribal population, is the only district that hasn’t reached 60% first-dose coverage. Dr Sachin Desai, immunisation officer for Maharashtra, said that under the “har ghar dastak” campaign, smaller teams are now targeting every village. An official from Nandurbar said that they have drawn up lists of people from each village and are reaching them accordingly. “There will be camps at banks and market places. Health workers will also travel over Narmada river in boat ambulances to reach villages that are on the banks,” the official said, adding that they are encountering hesitancy among people. Dr Desai said that the state is watching the performance of all districts and not just these six. Apart from Nandurbar, Beed is another district that is lagging and has managed to give a single shot to only 58% people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-5-of-six-vax-laggard-districts-in-state-better-dose-coverage-within-15-days/articleshow/87767373.cms||---

At the same time, it also means 33% of students do not have phones for online classes. Also, just 21% have access to smartphones all the time, says the report, which roughly translates to 38 lakh considering the total enrolments of 1.79 crore. Educationists are crediting it to the sudden blast of online education in the pandemic year. Online education could have been imparted through laptops or tablets, which have been a privilege for a few, but the only resort for the masses is smartphones to access online education. “Online education has been the best available option in the unprecedented situation. It becomes very important to study the impact of screen time on students age-wise to fully understand its impact,” said Puneet Sharma, an expert on education based in Jaipur. The ASER has not come up with learning outcomes report, which could have given a better picture on how far the smartphones have faired in imparting education. Pranjal Singh, president of Abhyuthanam, working for the education of disadvantaged students said, “In all our inspections in low-income families, we could hardly find student learning through smartphones. The mismatch in the accessibility of smartphones has further divided the gap between the haves and have nots,” said Singh. Pointing out the ill effects of the increasing access to smartphones, RK Gupta, senior professor of paediatrics, Sawai Man Singh Medical College said, “Rising access to smartphones should be taken as an achievement. The uncontrolled use is actually having multiple effects—health, sociological and psychological on children.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/67-kids-have-smartphones-for-online-classes-in-state/articleshow/87768100.cms||---

The recent order of the Supreme Court had mandated the government to increase the period of LoI so that the successful bidders could get environment clearances in time and start mining. The state government issues LoIs to issue mining leases. Leases are granted and signed only after the lessee gets environment clearances. Mines minister Pramod Jain Bhaya said the department is taking all measures to stop illegal mining and allow legal activities to meet bajri requirements in the state. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-amends-rules-3-more-bajri-mines-set-to-start-mining/articleshow/87768102.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Delhi: How even young and healthy are falling prey to pollution||NEW DELHI: A 30-year-old man with no history of respiratory problems had to be admitted to the hospital last week after he complained about acute onset of breathlessness, wheezing and low oxygen levels. Doctors at Aakash Super-Specialty Hospital said tests confirmed that the patient, an IT professional, had eosinophilic asthma, marked by high levels of eosinophil cells. The man had no history of smoking or asthma, doctors said. Dr Akshay Budhraja, a consultant for the pulmonology department at the hospital, said that the poor air quality triggered his illness. “He had no fever or signs of any active infection and no other associated factor that could have caused such symptoms,” he added. Generally, Dr Budhraja said, asthma symptoms are caused by narrowing of the airways due to inflammation. Eosinophilic asthma causes inflammation of the entire respiratory system, from the nose down to the tiniest airway. This inflammation happens due to hyper-responsiveness of the airway due to inhaled allergens or pollutants, he added. The doctor explained that breathing may become more laboured in eosinophilic asthma, and wheezing may get louder. Proper and timely treatment is important to avoid the risk of permanent narrowing of the airways and damage to the lungs. “The patient came to the emergency wing of the hospital with difficulty in breathing about two and a half weeks ago. His blood levels showed eosinophilia, which suggests allergy that caused a flare-up of bronchial asthma due to poor air quality,” Dr Budhraja said, adding that the patient had to be given oxygen therapy, steroids and bronchodilators. A significantly raised eosinophil level, obstructive pattern in the pulmonary function test, raised exhaled nitric oxide level and clinical examination confirmed that the case was a flare-up of eosinophilic asthma. The patient has no history of smoking, asthma or infection, said the pulmonologist. Like this patient, many young persons and even children are being rushed to hospitals with respiratory complications. A senior doctor at Madhukar Rainbow Children’s Hospital said they were getting five to six admissions among children suffering from respiratory complications over the past few days. “Some people are also suffering from anxiety attacks. We have received at least two patients who came with complaints of chest congestion and uneasiness. Tests revealed nothing. Both had recovered from Covid last year,” doctors say.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-even-young-healthy-are-falling-prey-to-pollution/articleshow/87767363.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: BJP, Congress oppose excise policy, hold protests outside new stores||NEW DELHI: Even as restaurateurs and the industry have been rejoicing due to the new excise policy coming into effect, BJP and Congress have opposed the move and started protests outside the new liquor stores. Both parties have accused chief minister Arvind Kejriwal of prioritising alcohol sales over governance or fighting pollution. Adesh Gupta, Delhi BJP president, held a protest rally at Jantar Mantar on Wednesday and asserted that his party would oppose the new policy tooth and nail and not let even a single new liquor store open. “The AAP government has argued that the new excise policy will increase the revenue of the government, but there are several other ways to do it rather than promoting liquor consumption. Instead of ensuring that youths get employment, the CM is pushing them towards alcoholism,” claimed Gupta. Gupta, the councillor from West Patel Nagar, said the new policy had proposed three liquor stores in each ward. “These stores will be opened in residential colonies and neighbourhood markets and cause law and order problems. BJP will lead a jan andolan and oppose opening of every new liquor store,” he added. Leader of Opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said that AAP came to power promising to open new schools, colleges, hospitals, flyovers and water treatment plants, but was instead opening new liquor stores. “The new excise policy will make the atmosphere bad for women and girls and they will not feel safe,” he alleged. Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee (DPCC) president Anil Kumar Chaudhary and his party workers protested near Chawri Bazar Metro Station. “Delhi has a high unemployment rate. In such a situation, the AAP government has implemented the new excise policy to allow free flow of liquor that will ruin the life of youths. We will continue to protest against it,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-cong-oppose-excise-policy-hold-protests-outside-new-stores/articleshow/87767388.cms||Amin Ali

The police identified the accused as Ananthu, 22, of Kunnappuzha near Thirumala. The incident related to the case took place on October 18. A police team comprising members of Karamana police station and city anti-narcotic cell were attacked by the gang using crude explosives when the former raided a tourist home at Killipalam to catch the gang. The gang members were hiding in a room on the third floor of the tourist home. While the police managed to nab two, including a minor aged 17, from the spot. They also seized five kilograms of ganja, small quantity of synthetic drug MDMA and dangerous weapons such as three air pistols and two machetes from their room.

---||Kolkata||Stress on practical classes to plug gaps left behind by 20 months of online teaching||Kolkata: Though most schools taught students successfully in the online mode, there is a huge backlog as far as practical lab-based parts of the syllabus is concerned for classes XI and XII. Hence, schools are gearing up to address the issue now. Almost in all schools, Class XI students are being put through a regimen of laboratory sessions so that they get hands-on training in the experiments that they are supposed to perform. Learning gaps have also developed in subjects like geography, economics, accountancy and geometry and co-ordinate geometry, according to teachers. So, in-person classes will first address these portions of the syllabus. Map pointing, for example, is an area where teachers have tried their best to mark the maps and send pictures on WhatsApp groups for children to practice at home. But minute errors remain since teachers did not get a chance to look at kids’ work and correct them. “Now teachers will have an opportunity to help children individually in the class,” said Rupa Sanyal Bhattacharjee, principal of South Point High School. Geometry is one area where kids have been struggling to cope with concepts and schools felt that theorems and their logical applications on figures can never be fully explained in the online mode. “Construction and applications in geometry need a lot of hand-holding. So we kept geometry to be done in the end hoping that schools would re-open,” said a maths teacher. On Wednesday, as Class XI students of South Point High School came in, they went straight to the labs. At The Heritage School, too, Class XI students spent the day in the labs. “No online video can train children to identify colour change of chemicals they are experimenting with. They have to heat the chemicals and see the change and record it themselves. We are starting intense lab training now to fill the gap. In physics again, for example, how can you only theoretically teach parallax error, unless a child observes it in the lab?” reasoned principal Seema Sapru. At La Martiniere for Boys, the IX and XI science classes are happening in the labs so that teachers can club theory and practical teaching. “Class IX has come into school straight after Class VII, so for them the transition has been very big and hence the lab experience will help them understand concepts better,” said John Stephen, acting principal. Students of Class XI at South City International School will also be put through intense practical lab sessions from Monday. “Those in Class XII who will be writing their month-long ISC semester one exam from Monday. We will give them lab training immediately after the exams are over,” said principal John Bagul.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/stress-on-practical-classes-to-plug-gaps-left-behind-by-20-months-of-online-teaching/articleshow/87766496.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Kolkata||High turnout at colleges, but hybrid classes to continue||Kolkata: The high turnout in most colleges and universities to attend offline classes after the reopening on November 16 will not impact the hybrid class routine. Authorities have decided to call the students in a staggered manner, either prioritising them based on seniority or on lab-based subjects. Many colleges have divided the students in smaller groups and are calling them in different time slots to attend classes and use the labs. Those who are unable to come can attend the same classes online. Classrooms have been equipped with live-streaming facilities. At St Xavier’s College, most of the subjects have registered attendance of over 70%. “I spoke to the students personally and asked if they were comfortable coming to the campus and all of them said they were happy to be back. We are anyway continuing with hybrid and online classes for those who have not been called to the campus yet,” said Father Dominic Savio, principal of St Xavier’s College. “Mainly practical classes are taking place offline and students’ response is remarkably good. Other classes are taking place online. Students are free to visit campus as per their requirements,” said a professor of Presidency University. “On an average, we have registered 95%-97% attendance in different subjects in the last two days. Senior students have shown more enthusiasm in coming to the college. We have divided the students of each semester in smaller groups and provided different time slots,” said Krishna Roy, principal of Bethune College. At Maulana Azad College, too, students have shown enthusiasm in returning to the campus. Attendance in different subjects ranged from 70% to 90%, said principal Subhasis Dutta. “Few departments have started classes with limited students and the response is quite good. Research scholars are doing their lab works. Last-minute cleaning and repairing is going on in different labs because maximum departments are going to start from November 22 according to their schedules. The real picture will be available thereafter,” said Jadavpur University registrar Snehamanju Basu. At Seth Anandram Jaipuria College, the attendance has been above 80% in many subjects. “We have three shifts and the attendance in all the subjects has been good. We are calling students in a staggered manner,” said Asok Mukhopadhyay, principal of the college. Almost 100% students have turned up for practical classes at Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Centenary College, Rahara. “We have assigned one day each to students from each semester for practical classes. On Tuesday and Wednesday, almost everybody reported to college,” said principal Swami Kamalasthananda. “Student response is quite good, the first day attendance was 80-85%. “ said Calcutta University pro-VC Ashis Kr Chattopadhyay.

---||Vadodara||Tagged greylag goose draws many to protected wetland||Vadodara: While hundreds of greylag geese have descended on the Wadhwana wetlands in Dabhoi, one of them is drawing many bird lovers to the sprawling lake. A greylag goose with a satellite tag has been spotted in the lake that sees an influx of thousands of migratory birds in winter. “It was spotted first by a forest beat guard some days ago. The goose has a tag around its neck and as per the experts it seemed to be tagged in Mongolia. It is for the first time that a grey lag goose tagged in Mongolia has been spotted at Wadhwana,” said Kartik Upadhyay, an avid bird watcher, who photographed the goose along with Rahul Bhatt and Ravi Patel. “The bird flew over China and crossed north-east India and covered about 3,800km to reach Gujarat. It is the third time that a tagged greylag goose from Mongolia has been spotted in the state,” Upadhyay told TOI. In December last year, a tagged greylag goose was spotted at Nal Sarovar and in February this year, the same individual bird was seen at Navatalav wetland in Surendranagar. Ornithologist Devvratsinh Mori, who had photographed the bird in Surendranagar, had said that the goose was tagged in Mongolia. The Mongolia Conservation Centre that tags the geese keeps a tab on their movement and location. The Conservation Centre of Mongolia is involved with an international bird migration study. Upadhyay, however, said that it is difficult to ascertain if the goose seen at Wadhwana is the same that was spotted at Nal Sarovar and Surendranagar. When asked why these geese fly all the way from Mongolia to Gujarat, Upadhyay said, “The state has a good number of wetlands where these geese find an ideal habitat. Also, enough food is available for the migratory birds apart from safe environs here. It is good news that geese from Mongolia are now flying all the way to Wadhwana too,” Upadhyay added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/tagged-greylag-goose-draws-many-to-protected-wetland/articleshow/87766349.cms||Tushar Tere

More than Rs 100 crore is pending with various government departments and the public.Many water bills are pending for the last 10 years. During the campaign, people will be given an option to either pay the bills on the spot when officers go to collect it or their water connections will be cut within a few days. Manish Beniwal, additional chief engineer of PHED said, “During the campaign, we will visit people’s houses and give them notice. They have to pay on the spot or else a warning notice will be given to them. If they still do not abide, their connection will be cut a few days later.” Since the department is severely understaffed, a tender has been floated to hire contract workers to disconnect the waterlines. Contract workers along with PHED officials will visit each and every defaulter’s house to cut connections. For the last two years, there is a ban on disconnecting water connections of people who haven’t paid their bills.TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/phed-pay-water-bills-or-risk-losing-connection/articleshow/87768103.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Mandatory Marathi subject: Edu officials to compile Nagpur schools’ list||Nagpur: After the state government’s letter to fine schools that have not yet introduced Marathi as a mandatory subject, local education officials have started planning out their future course of action. Vaishali Jamdar, Nagpur division’s deputy director of education, told TOI that she has informed officers in all six districts under her purview to proceed as per provisions of the law. Last year, the state legislature passed the Maharashtra Compulsory Teaching and Learning of Marathi Language Act, which made binding on other board-affiliated schools to also introduce Marathi in their curriculum. Schools face a fine of Rs1 lakh if the subject has not been introduced. Jamdar said, “As soon as we received the letter from the state education director, district level officials were informed about the need to follow through with the action. Once their enquiry is complete, they will be sending me a report, based on which further action will be decided.” The introduction of Marathi subject is to be done in a phased manner till 2024. For the current session, Std I-II and Std VI-VII need to have Marathi as a mandatory subject. Sources in the district education office told TOI that as of now, information will have to come from schools on a ‘voluntary’ basis. “There is no way we can visit every single school when their Marathi class is on. In fact, it is not possible even if we had decided to visit institutions because across Maharashtra, Std I-II are closed. And Std VI-VII are open only in rural areas,” said an official. The education department is now going to resort to its preferred mode of communication, dispatching a notice or circular. “We will send these letters to all schools through our taluka level officials in which they shall be asked whether or not Marathi is a mandatory subject in these specific classes,” said the officer. Quite a few schools have not introduced the subject, but with information being sought on a voluntary basis, they may ‘misrepresent facts’ to escape action. The official, however, felt that no school would take such a risk. “They are committing to something in writing, and if it’s not the truth, they can be in serious trouble,” said the official. It’s expected that the entire information will be collected within two to three weeks and a report is sent to education department’s headquarters in Pune.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mandatory-marathi-subject-edu-officials-to-compile-nagpur-schools-list/articleshow/87767381.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The steep 36,000 rise in passenger count once again proved that Metro has become the primary means of commute for students, teachers and guardians. Metro’s north-south corridor clocked 3,34,345 passengers on Tuesday. The carrier had already advanced its starting time by half-an-hour from Monday and added six trains, running just 16 short of its pre-pandemic fleet of 288. Even as Metro had breached the 3.5lakh ridership on Sashthi (October 11) with 3,77,761 riders, daily passenger count has hovered around 3lakh over the past few weeks. On Monday, despite extended operational hours and added services, footfall on the Kavi Subhas-Dakshineswar stretch was around 2,97,000. On Tuesday, the count shot to 3,34,345 overnight. On Tuesday Metro sold 9,568 smartcards against Monday’s 8,764. Till 2pm on Wednesday, 5,300 new smartcards were issued. However, authorities are worried as around 4,000 commuters are returning smartcards daily. “People must understand that smartcards are the safest and most useful means of ticketing,”said Metro’s DGM Protyush Ghosh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/campus-reopening-pushes-up-metro-passenger-count/articleshow/87766517.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

Three women who stopped the car discovered that the kids, all destitute, were alleged victims of sexual assault. Shocking revelations soon tumbled out. The children told the women that the man visited them often and gave them things to eat, sometimes sedatives, took them with him to various locations and showed them inappropriate videos, asking them to perform similar acts. The women lodged a complaint at the Kotwali police station but the man was interrogated and let off. It was only when the women put a video of the car's interception on social media triggering outrage that police swung into action. SSP Bablu Kumar took cognisance and registered an FIR under sections 376 (rape), 294 (obscene acts and songs), 328 (causing hurt by means of poison), and 363 (kidnapping) of the IPC, along with sections 3,4,11 and 12 of Pocso (Prevention of Children from Sexual Offenses) Act. Police have formed four teams to identify other victims and are trying to trace the car's owner. Mahanagar general secretary of BJP, Hema Khatri, who was one of the three women who stopped the car with the children, said, “We had immediately called up the police and informed them about the incident. According to information from locals, the man used to frequently visit and take the kids along with him. Nobody reported it. Perhaps they were afraid.” Several such incidents in UP have come to light in the past. Twenty-four girls were rescued from the Maa Vindhyavasini Mahila and Balika Sanrakshan Griha shelter home in Deoria amid allegations of sexual exploitation. The issue had come to light after an 11-year-old girl fled from the home. During the investigation, it was discovered that the girls were drugged and made to entertain "powerful guests" in exchange for money. The CBI eventually took over the case in which an NGO was running the shelter home. In a similar incident, the CBI had arrested an official in the UP irrigation department in November 2020 for allegedly sexually exploiting children and peddling their videos and photographs on the dark web. The accused, Ram Bhawan, had allegedly exploited at least 50 children in the 15-16 year age group over the past 10 years in Chitrakoot, Banda, and Hamirpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-arrested-for-picking-up-destitute-kids-from-up-rly-stn-raping-them/articleshow/87766499.cms||Maria Khan
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘Keep testing even in areas with zero, low positivity’||Pune: Local authorities have been directed to maintain the Covid testing momentum in areas with zero weekly positivity or that below the state average of 1.35% to keep the infection’s spread at its lowest. Last week, Gondia and Nandurbar registered a zero positivity rate while 22 other districts across the state recorded less than 100 cases. “The number of active cases has been in the range of 800-1,000 over the past fortnight. Many districts need to scale up testing too,” said a state health department official. During the Diwali week, weekly testing numbers had halved to about 5.5 lakh as against 10-11 lakh tests as usually done. State task force members said even as the numbers were going down, it was necessary for these districts to prevent any new cases. “While cases are down, there should be no laxity in testing. There is a need to scale up testing in all these districts,” said task force member Dr Rahul Pandit. Dharavi has seen 37 days of zero infections since the second wave. However, that does not mean that such pockets should be ignored, said doctors. “Continuous testing is the only way to avoid any sudden rise in cases,” said a health official from Mumbai. In the cabinet note last week, nearly 22 districts registered less than 100 active cases, with the lowest numbers recorded from Nandurbar and Washim. However, it was found that the weekly testing in these districts too has become dismal. “In the Diwali week, weekly testing was less than 500 for Nandurbar and it was just 528 for Washim. Nearly seven districts registered weekly testing below 1,000,” said another health official. Public health expert and former state health director Dr P P Doke told TOI the state is in a crucial phase as there is barely any rise in cases despite restrictions being lifted around Diwali. Dr Doke, though, cautioned against letting down one’s guard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-keep-testing-even-in-areas-with-zero-low-positivity/articleshow/87767387.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Also, the fair has gradually turned into a market due to a venue change.As the devotees coming to the religious fair have to travel 2km to reach the new venue, Motisar Road, the cattle fair is being attended mostly by buyers and sellers, who are essentially farmers from Punjab, Haryana, and Gujarat.Satya Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Ludhiana, said there were no basic facilities for water and cleaning available in the new cattle fairground. Another farmer, Manjeet Singh from Punjab’s Hoshiarpur, said they were provided with the space, but no food or other amenities.The administration said they got the permission to organise the fair too late and were unable to prepare the new ground for the fair. The old fairground had turned into a private property and the administration decided to shift the fair to Motisar Road, they said.Camels are no longer the attraction of Pushkar cattle fair and horses are participating in large numbers. "Horses costing Rs 25 crore to Rs 90,000 are available in the fair, but the traders are from other states," said Suresh Kumawat, a camel-cart owner. Camels can be spotted as camel-carts had been brought for tourists. But this time, even the footfall of tourists is less. "Not even local tourists have come in. Those who come for the religious fair, reside in dharamshalas," said a hotel owner.The cattle fairground on Wednesday was like a cattle mart, where only trade and checking of animals were seen, "As the camel has been made the state anima, people fear to purchase camel. Also, there is fear of transporting camel outside the state," said a middleman of the cattle business.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/not-camels-horses-steal-show-at-pushkar-fair/articleshow/87768107.cms||---

Gehlot said on Tuesday that the cabinet reshuffle in the state will take place soon. Speaking to reporters in Bhilwara on Wednesday, Pilot said there are vacancies in the government as well as in the party organisation and we will have to move forward with a combination of experience and youth. Pilot said that youths and workers on the ground will have to be empowered. "When they realise that they have full participation in the government, then definitely we will be forming the government in 2023 again." Pilot, who was the Rajasthan Pradesh Congress Committee chief during the rule of the former BJP government led by Vasundhara Raje, said, “Time flies. During the previous BJP government's rule, we struggled on the road against the BJP government because there was no one in the government to hear us. That was the government of arrogance and we have to set an example contrary to it. We are working in that direction,” he said. The Congress leader said he is fighting for those who struggled for the party and its victory in the elections. "If we make them participate in the government, it will be good for the party and the state as well. Youths will have new energy. Everyone has accepted this and the result will be visible in the days to come,” he said. Asked about teachers telling the chief minister on Tuesday that money has to be given for transfers, Pilot said the CM has already promised that a transfer policy will be made. He said that transparency should be there in all departments, and not in just one. "When we were in opposition, we exposed the corruption of the BJP government. People trusted us and gave us votes." He also targeted the centre over issues of inflation and unemployment. Pilot said the Congress is the only alternative to BJP at the national level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pilot-bats-for-experience-youth-in-govt-and-party/articleshow/87768106.cms||---

Health officials said the doctor, who was on duty on November 11, had allegedly asked his colleague to perform the autopsy ‘due to his busy schedule’. The latter did conduct the autopsy but failed to hand the report to the family. When asked what led to the delay, CMO, Sambhal, Dr Ajay Kumar Saxena, said the doctor was contacted but he said he had not done the autopsy. Suspecting a foul play in the case, the CMO registered a complaint with Sambhal Police. Speaking to TOI, he said, “Dr Khilendra Saxena had performed the postmortem. Two other doctors, too, visited the mortuary the same night, as per the sweeper’s account. To corroborate the sweeper’s claim, Dr Khilendra Saxena was contacted but he, too, said he had not conducted the autopsy.” Following this, the CMO said that he was left with no option but to but initiate legal action as the delay in autopsy report was hampering police investigation too. “I have complained against all four people, including three doctors. We tried contacting Dr Khilendra Saxena but he is not resonding.” Inspector, Bahjoi police station, Sambhal, Ajay Singh, said, “An FIR under various IPC section,s including 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant, or agent) and 120B (punishment of criminal conspiracy) has been registered against Dr Khilendra Saxena, Dr Souvir Singh, Dr Raj Kishore and a sweeper. Role of mortuary caretaker, Hirdesh Kumar, is also under scanner.

That could have solved all the problems and also raised the revenues of the state government. We could have got back the business we are losing to Punjab and Haryana,” said Suneet Bagai, president of the association. He said the dealers are also taking huge losses because of the reduction on excise duty by the Centre and the VAT by the state. “We have written to the Union petroleum minister to give the dealers some relief,” added Bagai.If the state had brought down the rates at par with Punjab, it would have increased demand for diesel in the state and also brought down rates of several goods and services. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/despite-vat-cut-raj-will-still-lose-biz-to-neighbouring-states/articleshow/87768112.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Need affidavit from all HC Bar members: SC over judge boycott call||Jaipur: An unconditional apology by the president and general secretary of Rajasthan High Court Bar Association, Jaipur, for its decision to boycott justice Satish Kumar Sharma did not satisfy the Supreme Court. While rejecting the apology, the top court has given all the office bearers, including the president and general secretary, time till November 26 to submit fresh affidavits and resolutions. The court also refused to grant exemption to office bearers from personal appearance.The association had given a call to boycott the judge on September 27 after he rejected demand of a lawyer to hear a case involving him at once. The association then passed a resolution to boycott the judge till his roster was changed. The Supreme Court, taking strong exemption in the case, said only by the actions of such lawyers, the legal profession had lost its respect.The court while hearing a suo motu petition on the matter said, “We have a dire need to improve the level of advocacy in the country. This is not the case of a one association. More or less the same is the case with the entire judicial system of the country,” observed Justice M R Shah and Justice Sanjiv Khanna during a long hearing of the case while rejecting the apology and the affidavit of the Bar association president Bhuvnesh Sharma and general secretary Giriraj Prasad Sharma. Justice Sanjiv Khanna observed that “this is a serious issue, showing its seriousness, all the Bar office bearers have to give an affidavit apologising separately for the mistake done at every level. Affidavits of president and secretary alone will not work.”The court added, “This court is also the guardian of all courts of the country. The seriousness of the case cannot be reduced by accepting an apology. This court has from time to time called strikes and boycotts as unconstitutional, but most of the Bar associations was making fun of our orders. Rajasthan is at the forefront in this matter...”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/need-affidavit-from-all-hc-bar-members-sc-over-judge-boycott-call/articleshow/87768108.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Why ban on thermal plants may not lead to power crisis||NEW DELHI: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) issued directions on Tuesday to shut down six of the 11 thermal power plants within a 300-km radius of Delhi. Even though the city depends heavily on thermal power, sources said the direction to temporarily close these power plants wouldn’t affect life because the demand currently was low and manageable. On Tuesday, CAQM said only five power plants would be allowed to operate and the rest would remain inoperative at least till November 30. Out of the five, three are located in Haryana’s Jhajjar and Panipat districts and two in Rajpura and Mansa in Punjab. “Secretary, ministry of power, informed that load requirements, if any, arising out of such closures shall be duly facilitated through power supply from other power plants located beyond 300-km radius of Delhi,” stated CAQM’s directions. Sources said that the need to source power from plants located further away might not arise at all. According to officials, the demand for electricity in Delhi at present is low, as is normal for the winter months. After a peak demand of more than 7,300MW at one point in the summer, the demand slid to around 4,562MW in October and is currently below the 4,000MW mark. Officials assured that even if the power demand in the city rose, it could be sourced from many different power plants across the country. While the power distribution companies buy electricity at Rs 5.5-6 per unit as part of long-term arrangements, they also buy from other sources when needed. While CAQM has directed the temporary closure of six of the 11 thermal power plants near Delhi in view of the air pollution crisis, Delhi’s power minister Satyendar Jain had written to Union power minister R K Singh in October last year, urging him to shut down the thermal power plants operating in the National Capital Region. Jain had argued that the biggest contributors to Delhi pollution were the thermal power plants around the city. He had pointed out that in a bid to bring down the pollution levels in the capital, Delhi government had shut down the Indraprastha power plant in 2009, Rajghat power plant in 2015 and the Badarpur power plant in 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-ban-may-not-lead-to-a-power-crisis/articleshow/87767402.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Delhi||Delhi: Stay on Janakpuri liquor shop following residents’ petition||NEW DELHI: A court has put an interim stay on opening a liquor shop in a residential area in Janakpuri. Civil Judge Vaishali Singh had on November 15 said prima facie a case was made out and directed not to open the shop at a flat till the next date of hearing. The company, which has been granted the licence to run the liquor shop in Janakpuri West, has obtained the flat of one Ajay Arora on lease, the suit filed by the residents welfare association stated. It claimed the news of the opening of a liquor shop had caused an alarm and a situation of fear and panic in the mind of residents. “The block A5B/A5C shares a common boundary with a huge public park (maintained by the DDA), which accommodates many budding sportspersons and athletes of the society and the nearby areas. Many young children and adolescents also regularly visit the park. It is worth mentioning here that the property mentioned above is likely to cause nuisance within the radius of less than 50 metres of the park,” the suit, moved through advocate Abhimanyu Lall and Mohit Rana, claimed. It further claimed that the property in question was at a critical location with more than three schools and various coaching institutions. “It is pertinent to mention here that the property in question and the schools share various public parks, which are used by the students of the schools and coaching institutions after study hours,” it stated. “The opening of the liquor shop may severely cause a very bad impact upon the mind of students as it is well established that wherever there is a liquor shop nearby some park or playground, there are higher chances that the people who purchases liquor tries to carve the opportunity to consume the alcoholic products at such places where they may not be suspected,” the RWA plea stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/stay-on-janakpuri-liquor-shop-following-residents-petition/articleshow/87767415.cms||---
---||Pune||11% patients screened in 44 medical college hospitals had COPD: Study||PUNE: A week-long screening programme across 44 medical college hospitals in India has found that 11% of the patients studied had Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The programme, organised by Pune’s Chest Research and Training Private Limited (CREST), screened 2,440 patients in the OPDs of the hospitals. CREST director Dr Sundeep Salvi told TOI, “Out of the 2,440 patients, 269 (11%) were found to have COPD, of which 201 were men and 67 were women. Nearly 161 of these were smokers, the findings revealed. In some medical colleges, one in every six patients screened had COPD and in others, every fourth patient had the disease.” In Jaipur, Rajasthan and Ujjain, every third patient visiting the OPD of the medical colleges as part of the study had COPD, he said. The screening programme was organised as part of the World COPD Day on November 17. During the five-day programme, every patient visiting the chest department was tested for COPD using a tool comprising a set of eight questions and a peak flow meter test. The ones who screened positive took a spirometry test that was performed by the Breathe Free educator team of Cipla. The treating doctor then examined those found positive on the spirometry. The final diagnosis of COPD was based on spirometry and by the treating doctor in the medical college. Colleges from Maharashtra where patients were screened were Pune-based Bharati Vidyapeeth and Kashibai Navale. Chest Research and Training Private Limited (CREST) director Dr Sundeep Salvi said COPD patients are likely to have very severe Covid-19 when they catch the infection. “COPD patients, thus, have to be protected from catching Covid-19 with stringent protocols such as hand hygiene, masking, social distancing being very important for such patients,” he said.  COPD is a chronic, progressive lung disease with intermittent periods of exacerbations, called lung attacks, that can often be fatal. “It is caused by long-term exposure to noxious pollutants that causes damage to the breathing tubes and the gas exchange portion of the lung. Tobacco smoking in any form, household air pollution from burning of biomass fuels for cooking purposes, burning of mosquito coils, long-term exposure to ambient air pollution from motor vehicular exhausts, industry smoke, road dust, and working in dusty workplaces for many years are the risk factors associated with COPD ,” he said. According to experts, COPD can be diagnosed with the help of a test called spirometry, yet many doctors or hospitals across India do not have this test. Thus, many COPD cases remain undiagnosed or wrongly diagnosed, leading to undertreatment and wrong treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/11-patients-screened-in-44-medical-college-hospitals-had-copd-study/articleshow/87767401.cms||---

A counsel appointed by the district legal service authority to represent the victims told the court that one of the two daughters of the migrant family, which was selling footwear in Kochi, informed this to him. Based on the submission, Justice Devan Ramachandran directed that this should also be investigated along with the other allegations against the police team involved in the case. The mother of the girl had earlier alleged that an ASI had demanded Rs 5 lakh to go to Delhi and trace the missing girl and had booked her two sons for raping their sister when the family couldn’t pay up. The missing girl had later informed the court through legal services authority that she was pressurized into giving statement against her brothers. The family had also alleged that they were forced to purchase flight tickets for the five-member police team. The court also pointed out that the police team could not have gone to Delhi without informing a controlling authority as per law and asked to explain, by December 2, how the controlling authority thought expenses for the Delhi trip would be met. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/missing-girl-case-hc-orders-probe-into-allegation-against-asi/articleshow/87767400.cms||---

The police, on the basis of forensic evidence, have also given a clean chit to the constable who was found sleeping next to the crime spot and was the prime suspect. Meerut senior superintendent of police (SSP) Prabhakar Chaudhary told TOI that the accused, Vishal Gupta, 22, is the son of the victim’s maternal aunt and they had known each other since childhood. “The accused had requested the girl to click a selfie with him, but she refused. He then asked her to meet him in private saying he wanted to discuss some important matter with her. He then took her to room number 2, which was vacant. Once inside, he initially tried to take a selfie with her but soon made advances to her and she kept on resisting him. The girl then told him that she needed to use the washroom, but before she could lock the door from inside, Vishal pushed the door open and attempted to molest her,” said the SSP. When the girl told Vishal that she would shout and tell the family about his acts, he tried to gag her with his hands. She soon fell unconscious and died, said the SSP. “The accused initially thought she is unconscious and tried to rape her by removing her clothes, only to find that she was menstruating,” the SSP added. Vishal then ran out of the room, and he was the first person to accuse the constable of murdering the girl and beat him up, said police. He was also among the people who took the body to hospital and remained with the family until the cremation. The girl, who was preparing for CA, was a bright student and had secured 85% in 12th board exam. Her father runs a grocery store, and her elder brother is pursuing MBA. SSP Chaudhary said the constable, who was found sleeping in the room adjacent to the toilet, is innocent and that he was an invitee. “He slept in the room and never went to the washroom where the body was found lying on the floor. We have all the evidence to prove that he is not guilty,” said the SSP.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Focus on Banabitan clean-up after Salt Lake dengue spike||KOLKATA: With the number of dengue cases on a rise in and around Salt Lake area, the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) has sent a letter to the Banabitan authorities in Salt Lake, asking them to clear the overgrown weeds inside the park and keep the premises clean to prevent mosquito breeding. Civic authorities said people, who regularly take their morning stroll inside the 70-acre green space, have complained of unkempt bushes and hyacinths in the waterbody. These are ideal breeding place for aedes aegypti mosquito, which transmits dengue. BMC authorities had recently inspected the Karunamoyee bus terminus complex located adjacent to Central Park where mosquito larvae was found. A Banabitan official, however, said that they have also sent a letter to the civic authorities, informing that rubbish from the adjacent fair ground is often dumped inside the Banabitan complex. “We regularly do cleaning work with help of the civic authorities but some rubbish often gets dumped inside Banabitan premises. Also hyacinths that can be seen are used for generating compost. Till now, there has been no report of any staff being affected by dengue,” said an official. Local residents said that the late surge of dengue in the township have been a cause of concern. “I have heard that quite a few people staying in and around Karunamoyee are getting infected by dengue. Being a regular morning walker and staying close to Central Park, the apprehension of being bitten by mosquito is always on my mind. It will be good if the area is cleaned,”said Surajit Maji, a school teacher and resident of FD block. “Regular vector control steps have been taken in the last two years due to stress on Covid management. Hopefully, the cleaning of Banabitan along with regular larvicide spraying will help prevent spike in dengue cases,” said Tamal Pal, a resident of HB block. BMC areas have seen a spike in cases in the last one and half months, with over 200 cases reported across Salt Lake and Rajarhat since October 1. The number of cases were very low till end of September this year when about 25 cases were reported. According to civic authorities, out of the fresh dengue cases, about 60% have been reported from Salt Lake and most of them live around Karunamoyee and Central Park area. A 33-year-old woman recently died of dengue in Baguiati area, becoming the first victim to fall prey in BMC area this year. “We will warn people if stagnant water and mosquito larvae is found in their premises. If they fail to comply, a notice will be put up at the house for neighbours to be aware,” said a BMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/focus-on-banabitan-clean-up-after-salt-lake-dengue-spike/articleshow/87766527.cms||Suman Chakraborti

On Tuesday, the Calcutta High Court asked the state government to ensure all Covid norms are followed during Christmas and New Year celebrations. Christmas celebrations at Bow Barracks, which continue for over a week with several functions and programmes, attract thousands of people from across the city. Last year, the association had barred entry of outsiders owing to the pandemic but still several people turned up on December 23, 24 and 25. “Normally, we firm up our Christmas plans by this time of the year, but we want to be sure of the Covid situation before taking a final decision. Covid has not gone and after every festival, we have witnessed a spike in the number of cases. The Christmas celebrations at Bow Barracks attract people from far and wide and we do not want to take any chances for the safety of the residents of Bow Barracks. There will definitely be Christmas celebrations but if it will be open to everybody or just for the residents will be decided depending on the Covid situation,” said Angela Govindraj, the secretary of the Bow Barracks Residents’ Welfare Association. Bow Barracks was built as Garrisons’ mess in 1918 for the accommodation of soldiers during World War I but they refused to move in. When Kolkata Improvement Trust was expanding Central Avenue and roads leading to it, several displaced Anglo-Indian families were rehabilitated in Bow Barracks. “Last year, we had limited the celebrations to local residents, but hundreds of people still came and it became difficult to control the crowd. So, we have decided to wait and watch before taking a final decision,” said a resident of Bow Barracks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bow-barracks-christmas-no-decision-on-visitors-yet/articleshow/87766528.cms||Zeeshan Javed

With this, the state has covered nearly 78% of its eligible population with a single dose. Maharashtra is second only to UP that has administered the highest single doses in the country (10.3crore). “Now, more than 7 crore people in Maharashtra have received at least one dose of Covid vaccine. Maharashtra crossed this milestone today at 4pm. The number of fully vaccinated persons is 3.5 crore,” said Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary (health). Of the state’s eligible population of 9.1 crore, 38% have got both shots and are fully vaccinated. While the state is positive about meeting its target of giving its entire adult population at least one dose by November 30 — a soft deadline set by CM Uddhav Thackeray, the daily vaccination turnout is not holding much promise. Vaccinating everyone would mean covering more than 2 crore people in the next 13 days. To achieve that, the state has to clock nearly 14 lakh vaccinations daily. However, the daily footfall in the vaccination centres is half of that, around 6.5-7 lakh. Further, more people are coming for their second doses than the first shot. Dr Sachin Desai, the state’s immunisation officer, said the numbers have jumped since the Diwali slump. “Even if we can push up to 10 lakh doses daily, we will be close to that goal,” he said. Mumbai is also witnessing a drop in vaccination. On Wednesday, 57,742 people got vaccinated at the civic centres. Of these, nearly 45,000 took the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-crosses-7cr-milestone-on-vax-drive-2nd-only-to-up/articleshow/87767436.cms||---

The police stall soon became a centre of attraction among devotees congregating at Bijnor’s ghats to partake in the holy dip. According to an official estimate, five lakh people are expected to assemble at the place. SP (Bijnor) Dharmveer Singh said, “We have taken a leaf out of the Indian Army’s book and organised this exhibition. The display of police weapons of this standard will not only increase confidence among the general masses but also instil a sense of fear among criminals.” On Wednesday, day one of the fair, hundreds of devotees visited the exhibition and tried their hands at various weapons. “They came to the weapons. Policemen here not only helped them understand the role of these arms in different operations, but also provided the visitors information about the initiatives taken by our department for their safety and security," the SP said. Eight-year-old Janis, a resident of Rambagh village, who visited the exhibition along with her father Rupesh Kumar, said, “Police said that the weapons are for our safety, and they are our friends.” Inaugurated on Tuesday evening, the four-day fair will culminate after the Ganga snan when the sun sets on November 19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/in-a-1st-up-police-displays-weapons-at-pilgrimage-site-says-to-instil-fear-in-criminals/articleshow/87766593.cms||Harveer Dabas

The bike was unveiled at the Shola Utsav, a workshop on conservation of Sholas of Karnataka, organised by KWD on Wednesday. The institute has collaborated with KWD to design the e-vehicle that will help forest personnel during patrolling or reach a spot quickly in case of an emergency. The total cost of the forest e-bike is around Rs 1.5 lakh and it is funded by NITK and alumni. Mass production could reduce the cost of the bike to Rs 1 lakh. “The objective of this particular association is to empower personnel with e-mobility to commute around the forest region,” said KV Gangadharan, coordinator, Centre for System Design (CSD), NITK Surathkal. He said the forest e-bike is powered by a BLDC motor of 2K Watt, 72 Volts 33Ah lithium-ion battery. The battery can also be charged using solar power. The solar charging set up includes two 400W mono-crystalline solar panels and 1.5KW UPS unit for charging. The charging time is typically 3-4 hours. Fast charging is possible in 10 amps. Pruthviraj U, assistant professor, who assisted the project along with others said VidYug 4.0 stays true to being renewable, green and sustainable and definitely lives up to the expectation of being a unique e-bike to be used in rough forest terrains. The solar charging station becomes a necessity deep inside the national park region near anti-poaching camps and watchtowers as there won’t be access to other sources of power to charge the battery. Unique features The bike comes with a removable headlight which doubles up as a torch. This headlight includes a built-in battery and a switch. The headlight will charge along with the vehicle battery. The bike’s front utility box can be used to store work accessories of forest officials like walkie-talkie and books. It also has charging docks to charge the walkie-talkie and mobile phone. There is also a provision to carry water into deep forest areas customized easily to unload jerry cans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/nitk-designs-forest-e-bike-for-kudremukh-national-park/articleshow/87765748.cms||Kevin Mendonsa
---||Allahabad||Ganga pollution: Lack of coordination between Govt Depts causing confusion before court: HC||Box On KV Project added Prayagraj: Expressing concern over non-cooperation among different departments of the state in the matter of Ganga pollution, which is causing a lot of confusion before the court, a three-judge Bench of Allahabad High Court has asked the UP chief secretary to examine the said aspect and issue required directions to obviate the confusion and to have effective representation of the stand of the government before the court. Hearing a matter relating to Ganga pollution, a three-judge bench comprising Justice Manoj Kumar Gupta, Justice Siddhartha Varma and Justice Ajit Kumar said, “We notice that different departments, nodal and executing agencies are represented through different counsels and amongst whom there is no coordination, resulting in a lot of confusion. If the additional advocate general is representing the state, we expect that he should have full instructions, at least in respect of all matters falling under the purview of state government or its instrumentalities.” Regarding purity of Ganga water, the court observed that “the report from IIT, Kanpur is still awaited and we have been informed that there is a request for some more time being granted to enable it to complete the tests and submit the desired report”. “We accept the request and permit submission of the report in sealed cover through the registrar general of this court by the next date,” the court added while fixing December 6, 2021 for further hearing of the matter. “The other two reports from Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board and IIT, BHU shall remain in sealed cover and shall be opened on the next date along with the report of IIT, Kanpur,” the court further added. The court was not satisfied with the approach of Nagar Nigam, Prayagraj regarding cremation on the bank of river Ganga and said, “We do not appreciate the mindset with which the Nagar Nigam is handling the issue. No doubt, on account of religious beliefs, few people avail the services of electric crematoriums, but we feel that if proper facilities are provided at the electric crematoriums and people are educated and made aware of the advantages and disadvantages of use of electric crematoriums, more and more people will be attracted to avail the facilities. It is high time when the Nagar Nigam, Prayagraj should give up its old mindset and take immediate steps for improving the infrastructure of the two electric crematoriums and launch campaign for spreading awareness amongst general public in respect of the advantages in availing the services of electric crematoriums.” In this backdrop, the court in its order dated November 12 directed the additional chief secretary, Nagar Vikas, UP to examine the matter and place before this court its plan in respect of improvement of the infrastructure of the two electric crematoriums and the time frame within which it will be implemented. On the question of ban on use of plastic the commissioner, Prayagraj division has filed his affidavit annexing therewith order dated November 8, 2021, whereby a committee comprising ADM city, Prayagraj, additional municipal commissioner, Nagar Nigam, Prayagraj and superintendent of police (City), Prayagraj has been formed to oversee the implementation of the ban on plastic carry bags in pursuance of government order (GO) dated July 15, 2018. BOX The Allahabad High Court has issued notices to Sri Kashi Vishwanath Special Area Development Authority and has asked the Authority to file its affidavit through its chief executive officer (CEO) giving details of the schemes and all constructions which are proposed or are underway in and around the river Gange in Varanasi district. The court passed this order after the vice-chairman, Varanasi Development Authority (VDA), filed an affidavit stating that the regulation of construction in or along the bed of the river Ganga in Varanasi district is now being regulated in accordance with the provisions of Sri Kashi Vishwanath Special Area Development Board Varanasi Act, 2018 and is outside the purview of the regulated area falling under the Urban Planning and Development Act, 1973.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/ganga-pollution-lack-of-coordination-between-govt-depts-causing-confusion-before-court-hc/articleshow/87766603.cms||---

Anand Teltumbde is currently lodged in jail in connection with the Elgar Parishad case. Teltumbde’s plea said their mother is in a state of shock and bereavement after learning about the death of her son Milind. Allowing the plea, the court said that considering the fact that the mother is 90 years old and that the advocate submitted that only one opportunity to make phone call be given, it would be just to consider the submission. “Hence, the Superintendent Taloja Central Prison shall allow accused to make phone call to his mother for 5 minutes by keeping the phone on speaker mode,” the court said. It further held that the superintendent should get it confirmed that the person speaking from the other side is the mother. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-elgar-accused-teltumbde-allowed-5-mins-call-with-mom/articleshow/87767451.cms||---

The deputy collector claimed that there was no money laundering since the money claimed fraudulently was returned to the trust’s account and frozen by the police. It is alleged that the deputy collector, Ajay Pawar, had conducted a meeting to examine the documents before clearing the compensation in the lieu of the trust land that the government had acquired for Rajiv Gandhi IT Park. The government had announced a Rs 8.76 crore compensation to the land owner, Tabut Inam Endowment Trust. There was a dispute after four persons claimed to be trustees and office-bearers of the trust. The accused even produced allegedly forged NOC of the Waqf Board stating that it had no objection on releasing the fund after which the amount was released.

---||Kochi||Muslim divorce: Only short hearing needed for court’s nod, says Kerala HC||KOCHI: A family court considering a plea for endorsing out-of-court divorce, either unilateral or mutual, under Muslim personal law only need to conduct a summary hearing to allow it and need not conduct a detailed enquiry, the Kerala high court has held. The ruling that would speed up the process of obtaining divorce and getting it endorsed in a public record through a court was issued by a division bench of Justice A Muhamed Mustaque and Justice Kauser Edappagath. A petition filed by Asbi KN through advocate C Dilip was considered by the court. While a Muslim man divorcing his wife through out-of-court process is called a ‘talaq’, a Muslim woman doing so is called a ‘khula’. If divorce is through mutual consent, it is called ‘mubaarat’. It is a common practice to seek the court’s endorsement, under Section 7(d) of the Family Courts Act, 1984 so as to have a public record of the divorce. In the judgment, authored by Justice Kauser, the high court said, “The endorsement of extrajudicial divorce and consequential declaration of the status of the parties by the Family Court invoking S.7(d) of the Act is contemplated only to have a public record of the extrajudicial divorce. Hence, a detailed enquiry is neither essential nor desirable in a proceeding initiated by either of the parties to endorse an extrajudicial divorce and to declare the marital status. The Family Court has to simply ascertain whether a valid pronouncement/declaration of talaq or khula was made and it was preceded by effective attempt of conciliation.” No further enquiry as in the case of an adversarial litigation like chief examination and cross examination of the parties are not at all contemplated while endorsing extrajudicial divorce under Muslim personal law, the court said, adding that that the family court should endorse the plea if it is prima facie satisfied that a valid pronouncement of ‘talaq’, ‘khula’, or ‘mubaarat’ was made. The court also issued a seven-point guideline for family courts to deal with such cases. The judgment was delivered on October 12 but a copy became available only on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-only-short-hearing-needed-for-courts-nod/articleshow/87767460.cms||---

Sadly, only three were approved. According to education department officials, pandemic-induced crisis has forced parents to get their wards enrolled in village schools as they can no longer afford the hefty fee charged by private schools. Notably, this year witnessed an unprecedented rise in the number of admissions in these schools. Last year, there were 1,84,000 students in the district, which is now 2,09,000. On the rise in enrollment, district coordinator, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, Saleem Beg, said, "We had demanded 178 new classrooms but funds have been sanctioned for only three classrooms. Besides, there are 29 dilapidated buildings in the district. A proposal to renovate these was sent to authorities but the latter allocated budget for only five buildings. The number of students making a switch to government schools has been quite high,’gone up jumped up drastically.” Speaking to TOI, district president, parents’ association, Nrapendra Deshwal, said, "The facilities in primary and higher primary government schools are not as good as the private ones. But the fact remains that the number of students taking admission to government schools has gone up due to the profound impact of the pandemic.” Though private schools remained closed, parents were forced to deposit fee, the reason why parents opted for government schools. “Parents feel their wards are safe in schools that are nearby as private schools are far-off. But the problem is that the classrooms do not match the proportion of children in village schools,” added Deshwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/student-strength-up-in-govt-schools-edu-dept-seeks-178-new-classrooms-gets-nod-for-only-three/articleshow/87766612.cms||Harveer Dabas

Therefore, after vaccination of high-risk children, the next priority should be the immunisation of children of high-risk parents. The sdemand for the same is growing,” said senior paediatrician Pramod Jog, a member of the state’s paediatric Covid task force. The state’s paediatric task force last week submitted its recommendations to the state government to preferentially vaccinate children having underlying medical conditions like obesity, malnutrition, juvenile diabetes and nine others. The demand to vaccinate children of high-risk parents started after it. “After vaccination of children with high-risk conditions, next in priority should be adolescent children of high-risk parents,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India (HBI), Pune chapter. The two Covid vaccines — ZyCoV-D and Covaxin — meant for immunisation of children in the 2-18 years age bracket are likely to be introduced together under the country’s Covid immunisation programme by December-end. Covid immunisation of 472 million children under 18 years across the country involves logistic issues like the supply of vaccines. Prioritising the vaccination process holds the key. Current evidence suggests that children with medical complexity, with genetic, neurologic can be at an increased risk for severe illness from Covid-19. Like adults, children with obesity, diabetes, asthma or chronic lung disease can also be at an increased risk for severe illness from Covid-19. The Covid-19 vaccines would not be available to healthy children initially. About seven-eight months may be required for immunisation of all children.

Even as this has remained only a proposal so far, Rajasthan government has reached out to industrialists here wooing them to set up units along the refinery coming up at Barmer in that state. A refinery, with an investment of Rs48,000 crore, is being built at Barmer. It is expected to be ready by 2023. The state is looking for industries that may work as ancillaries to the facility, or even use the upstream and downstream products as raw materials. The Rajasthan government is hoping to get investment to the tune of another Rs48,000 crore from the industries coming from different states near the refinery. A team of officials from Rajasthan Industrial and Investment Corporation (RIICO) was camping in Nagpur for the last three days. A meeting was held with officials of Laghu Udyog Bharti (LUB) on Wednesday. LUB is the industrial association affiliated to Sangh Parivar. As it is headquartered in Nagpur, the purpose was to get access to all the 28,000-odd members across the country, said officials. RIICO officials said the state government has come up with a concept of non-resident Rajasthani. This means they are targeting businessmen hailing from Rajasthan and now running successful business in other states. “Their forefathers may have needed to migrate years ago due to hardships those days. However, we are now trying to woo them back, saying the situation has changed, and attractive schemes are on the offer,” said Virender Surana, a senior DGM from RIICO. Among the big companies, Confidence Petroleum from Nagpur has shown interest in investing in Rajasthan. The company has plans to set up filling stations and a bottling plant for compressed natural gas (CNG). Nitin Khara, chairman of Confidence Petroleum, also confirmed the development. The company already has bottling plants at Udaipur, Jaipur and Pali in Rajasthan. There are plans to set up another, apart from having filling outlets in the sites offered by RIICO, he said. The Barmer refinery is a joint venture of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited and Rajasthan government. This was initiated after petroleum reserves were found in the area, though imported crude and transported through Kandla port in Gujarat will also be refined here, said the officials. The benefits include investment subsidy, employment generation subsidy and exemption from electricity duty.

---||Dehradun||Nainital: Live cartridge, 7 empty shells found at Salman Kurshid’s vandalised house||DEHRADUN: Two days after senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid’s house was vandalised and shot at by a right-wing mob, Nainital police on Wednesday recovered seven empty shells and a live cartridge from the premises.  Khurshid has been in the eye of a storm over parallels drawn between “Hindutva” and Islamic terrorist outfits in his recent book 'Sunrise Over Ayodhya: Nationhood in Our Time'. “The bullets were found embedded in the ceiling and walls. The forensic team has seized all the recovered material for further investigation,” DIG (Kumaon) Nilesh Anand Bharne told TOI. Bharne said prima facie "it appears that someone in the mob had opened fire". He added that a team headed by circle officer (CO) Bhowali is investigating the incident. Khurshid’s house, located in Satkhol area in Ramgarh block of Nainital district, was vandalised on Monday afternoon. No one was hurt in the house that is looked after by caretakers, one of whom had later said someone in the mob had pointed a gun at his family. Soon after the incident, in a Facebook post the former minister of external affairs, sharing pictures and videos of charred doors and other parts of his house, had written, “I hoped to open these doors to my friends who have left this calling card. Am I still wrong to say this cannot be Hinduism? ...So such is debate now. Shame is too ineffective a word. Besides, I still hope that we can reason together one day and agree to disagree if not more.” Police have booked 21 people in connection with the incident. “One accused, Rakesh Kapil, has been identified and is absconding, while 20 others are yet to be identified," the DIG said. The FIR has been lodged under sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 456 (trespass or house-breaking), 552 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint) and 504 (insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/live-cartridge-7-empty-shells-found-at-kurshids-vandalised-house/articleshow/87765773.cms||Gaurav Talwar

The immediate response to people’s problem in the remotest locations during the campaign has been appreciated by those who had been longing for a respite. The sanctioning of 160 land leases on a single day was one of the biggest achievements of the PGKS campaign in the district. According to BDO Praveen Kumar Gupta, despite scattered population, 160 land leases were handed over to people of Karakala village in Jhallara. People had been living in this village for more than 50 years but had never heard of a patta (land lease). “During the campaign, we provided land lease to 90 per cent of the village population,” said Gupta. During the camp, 20 birth certificates, 10 death certificates and 11 families under NREGA scheme were provided new job cards. Pension payment order letters were also distributed to 13 persons. The PGKS campaign was a pleasing experience for people in other villages too. For Ram Singh of Sakariakhedi village in Mavli, getting the land deed was not less than a miracle. Development officer Jitendra Singh Chundawat said Singh’s house was situated in the “abadi” land of gram panchayat but due to lack of lease, he was not getting bank loan and other benefits. When Singh brought his problem in the camp, the officer in-charge and the development officer got the lease issued on the spot. Singh also got the benefit of Swachh Bharat Mission wherein Rs 12,000 were transferred directly into his bank account. His family was felicitated with “Garvilo Pariwaar” title for use of toilet in Swachh Bharat Mission. Samri Devi, a state widow pension beneficiary of Balewadi village, was provided the much-needed relief as her monthly pension was increased to Rs 1,000 from Rs 500 after necessary corrections in the age certificate. For Ganga of Pipli Phala village, the PGKS camps were a boon when she benefited under the Palanhara scheme. Ganga's two daughters were not getting the benefit of foster care. In this camp, all the documents of Palanhar scheme were prepared and application was prepared on the spot with the help of Sarpanch and Village Development Office. Approval was issued on the spot after verifying the form online by e-mitra and the process of adoption was approved in just one day. In Gogunda’s Obra Kala Gram panchayat, land lease was distributed to 128 beneficiaries. This camp proved to be a windfall for Bhanwari Bai, who was deprived of food security benefits at the ration shop because of the finger print issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/prashashan-camps-boon-for-villagers-in-udaipur-district/articleshow/87768153.cms||---

The state reported 1,003 cases and 32 deaths on Wednesday. In Mumbai, the count was 275 cases detected from 39,364 tests, which is higher than the usual 35,000 tests daily. Except for Wednesdays (Nov 3 and 10), the city’s tally has been under 300 cases since November 1. Daily fatalities in the city have been less than five for a week now, with only two deaths registered on Wednesday. Although the number of sealed buildings increased from 15 to 18 in a 24-hour period, civic doctors said hospitalisation hasn’t increased. Health minister Rajesh Tope clarified the government hasn’t decided on a blanket policy to deny services to unvaccinated citizens. “We do realise vaccination is voluntary, and the government is taking steps to clear misconceptions in the minds of people that are keeping them away from getting vaccinated. Some districts may have carried out some experiments to boost their vaccine numbers, but there is no uniform policy at the state level,” said Tope. State officials noted there have been no surges even over 10 days since Diwali, but warned against the drop in testing in many districts. “Some districts are doing just 30% of their total capacity, these districts have been asked to ramp up testing,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/mumbai-state-crosses-1000-cases-after-6-days-tope-clarifies-no-govt-policy-against-unvaxxed/articleshow/87777816.cms||---

---||India||GST intel busts laundering racket involving UP firm||NEW DELHI: In one of the biggest cases of money laundering unearthed in recent times, the Meerut zonal unit of the Directorate of GST Intelligence (DGGI) has initiated action in the alleged sale of Rs 5,000 crore worth of packaging materials by a little known Noida-based company, Montage Enterprises, to 228 companies, all of which have been found to exist only on paper. Five people have been arrested so far in the case, including two directors of Montage Enterprises who were remanded to 14 days of judicial custody on Tuesday by a chief judicial magistrate court in Meerut. According to DGGI, searches on transporters and certain pan masala/tobacco companies revealed the modus operandi where the Noida-based firm was found engaged in clandestine diversion of packaging materials against cash payments to some pan masala manufacturers. The probe has led to a few of the pan masala companies to acknowledge cash transactions worth Rs 1,100 crore. The firms have since deposited Rs 50 crore against duty evasion. The total cash generated in this racket is several times of Rs 5,000 crore of the packaging materials allegedly supplied, said a source. The seizure of unaccounted raw materials (bought in cash) and finished goods from one of the gutka manufacturers, which has two Bollywood superstars as its brand managers, has been estimated to be worth over Rs 800 crore. The firm, after arrest of a senior executive, has deposited Rs 20 crore against duty evasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gst-intel-busts-laundering-racket-involving-up-firm/articleshow/87768972.cms||Pradeep Thakur

However, University authorities said this particular rice variety, KAU Manu Varna, is recommended for the plains and not for hill ranges like Wayanad. “This was released for low lands of Kerala, especially for the Kole lands during Virippu and Mundakan seasons,” said Prof K Ajith Kumar, associate director of KAU’s regional agricultural research station at Ambalavayal in Wayanad. KAU Manu Varna is a rice variety released in December 2019 from KAU’s agricultural research station (ARS), Mannuthy, having 128-138 days duration, non-lodging and non-shattering and high tolerance to salinity. The variety also has other positive attributes like a higher number of productive tillers/plants, good milling and cooking qualities, tolerance to stem borer, leaf folder, gall midge, high amylose content, and is brown rice. However, its tolerance to blast disease is less compared to other similar varieties like KAU Manu Ratna. “The pathogen-climate-host interactions play a major role in the expression of pathogenicity of the causal organism. When a less tolerant variety developed for a different agro-climatic condition is introduced into an entirely different agro-climatic situation with inherent predisposing climatic factors favouring the disease, there is a high probability of severe disease incidence,” said Prof Kumar. However, farmers have alleged that University authorities have not told them in advance about the unsuitability of this variety for highlands like Wayanad. “We have purchased about 4,600kg of paddy seed from the ARS and cultivated it in about 250 acres of paddy field. We had told University authorities that we are from Wayanad. If they had shared even a hint of the unsuitability of this variety in highlands, we wouldn’t have purchased such a large quantity of seed,” P Rajeev Marar of Kaniyambetta, Wayanad, told TOI. Farmers are demanding that the government should compensate them for the crop loss.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/crop-damage-in-wayanad-not-due-to-seed-defects-claims-kau/articleshow/87767477.cms||T Ramavarman

The range offers sightings of elephants mostly but the track that takes them to such alluring sightings is in need of repairs. Incessant rainfall and then sudden October rain have left the track damaged. About 20km of the 36km track of Chilla range is broken, causing inconvenience to tourists having already paid for the trip. “It was a bad experience. They shouldn’t have given permission for the safari when they were not even ready with the tracks,” said one of the visitors of Chilla, who had to return midway on Tuesday. As per authorities, they had reconstructed a part of the road after the rains. But it got washed away due to unexpected October rains, pounding the entire state and leaving almost 70 people dead at various areas. “We had already opened the track for tourists in October after repairing it but incessant rainfall damaged it, making tourists suffer. Now again, we have tried to repair one of its patch so that tourists can move ahead and spot elephants and tigers,” said Anil Penuili, Ranger Officer, Chilla range, Rajaji Tiger Reserve. Citing fund crunch, forest officials claimed that the track was in such a state for lack of budget allocation. “With limited resources and funds, we try to do whatever we can do in our power to build the tracks. Once the budget is allocated, the track can be rebuilt,” added Penuili. The RTR has been visited by at least 100 tourists in the past three days, as per the officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/track-broken-wildlife-enthusiasts-turned-away-from-chilla-range-of-rajaji-tiger-reserve/articleshow/87765776.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Kolkata||After Covid hiatus, Kolkata-Singapore flights to take off again in November-end||KOLKATA: Singapore Airlines is all set to resume flights to Kolkata by the end of the month following the Singapore government decision to extend its vaccinated travel lane programme (VTL) to India. VTL allows quarantine-free travel for fully vaccinated individuals. Sources in the travel trade industry said the airline officials had indicated a November 29 date for the first flight between Singapore and Kolkata post Covid. Though there are flights between Singapore and India under the Vande Bharat programme, no flight to and from Kolkata has been operating. “Singapore Airlines will start flights from November 29, subject to the signing of bilateral agreement on bubble flights between the two countries,” said Travel Agents Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi. If the fight does go through, it will be the first direct link between Kolkata and Southeast Asia post pandemic. While the airline has not indicated the frequency, Travel Agents Association of India chairman (east) Manav Soni said he hoped there would be an Singapore Airlines flight on alternate days with Indian carriers — IndiGo or Vistara — operating on the other days to ensure a daily connection. “There is sizeable visiting friends and relatives traffic, besides that of students and tourists. There would be no problem in operating a daily flight with full load,” said Soni. The travel agent associations have also requested Indian carriers to start flights to Thailand, following Thai Airways’s decision to withdraw its six decade-old service from Kolkata. Thai Smile has hinted at operating flights from Kolkata in January with the Bird Group as its GSA. Sources in the travel trade industry said Air India had indicated its willingness to connect Kolkata with Bangkok and that SpiceJet was keen on a flight to Phuket. Prior to the pandemic, Thai Airways operated a daily flight to Kolkata. IndiGo flew twice daily to Bangkok, while SpiceJet and Air India also had connections. A couple of travel agents, including Gainwell Travel, have also announced chartered flights to Phuket on December 18, 22, 26 and 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-covid-hiatus-kol-singapore-flights-to-take-off-again-in-nov-end/articleshow/87767490.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The order also stipulated that cops must remove the “police logo,” from their private vehicles with immediate effect. The police also said that action will be taken against those who don’t follow the orders. Talking to TOI, a senior police official said that the police headquarters (PHQ) had recently made it very clear that rampant misuse of the police logos on private vehicles is a growing vehicle that warrants immediate action. “There is a risk of someone using police logo for illegal activities. Also, cops posted at a checkpoint are likely to shy away from stopping the vehicle, regardless of who is inside the vehicle,” the official claimed. The official said that besides the staff, CLG and police Mitra members will also be asked to remove police colours from their vehicles. “Only police vehicles authorised by the department are allowed to put the logo, the red and blue colours are meant to be used only after prior authorization,” the official said, adding that action will be taken against those who flouted the norms very soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cops-told-not-to-use-police-colours-on-pvt-vehicles/articleshow/87768158.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Police must show sensitivity in matters that could take communal turn: Uttarakhand HC||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC), in a matter that turned communal when police filed an FIR on the complaint of one community and ignored the other, said on Wednesday that there is a need for the police to show sensitivity in such issues. The court stressed on the importance of hearing both sides before lodging an FIR. The bench of Chief Justice R S Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma was on Wednesday hearing a petition filed by advocate Sana Hussain, who appeared on behalf of her family in a property dispute case in the Handi Bandi area of Mallital. She alleged that the police were pressurised by certain right-wing groups to arrest her brother, Saud Hussain, based on an FIR lodged by a man named Kuldeep Kumar. Alleging partisan behavior on the part of the police, Hussain alleged that when her family went to the police station to file a complaint based on which an FIR could be lodged, the police refused to take action. However, when Kuldeep Kumar went to the station along with members of some right-wing groups to register a complaint against her brother and some other family members the very next day, the police lodged an FIR. A case was registered against Saud Hussain under sections 354, 504, and 323 of the Indian Penal Code. Hussain alleged that members of the right-wing group, some of whom she says were BJP workers, started raising slogans demanding her brother's arrest while having a sit-in protest in the middle of the road in front of the police station. It was then, she says, that the police gave in and arrested her brother. The court asked the senior superintendent of police (SSP) Nainital to appear in court via teleconferencing. However, the bench was told that she was on leave. The court then asked the director general of police (DGP), Ashok Kumar, to appear in the matter. The DGP said that he has suspended the kotwal of Nainital, Pritam Singh, for taking action against only one party and not heeding the other in the case. He also said that disciplinary action has been taken against him. He added that security will be provided to the family of the advocate. The court thereafter disposed of the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/police-must-show-sensitivity-in-matters-that-could-take-communal-turn-ukhand-hc/articleshow/87765783.cms||---

A senior official told TOI that no shells were found after the incident, nor have any bullet marks been found on Koli’s house. “There are always some tell-tale signs of firing, but we have not stumbled upon anything which could confirm the allegations of firings yet,” said an official, adding that the inquiry is still underway. The alleged attack on Koli took place on November 10 when unidentified miscreants had put up a threatening poster with her photo crossed by a blue marker and two bullets on either side. The incidents led to a huge uproar and Rajasthan police constituted a special investigation team (SIT) to look into the case. So far, the investigation agencies have not been able to corroborate how many shots were fired, nor have they received any evidence which could point to the firing incident. A senior official claimed that locals in the area did not hear any gunshots. “We have not yet ruled out the firing yet, it is just that the incident has not yet been confirmed, neither in the preliminary probe nor by the locals,” the official said. The Rajasthan police said the SIT was also probing to see who went to Koli’s house in the middle of the night to put threatening posters and a letter. “We have been examining technical inputs to ascertain the movement of suspects around the MP’s house that night,” the official said, adding that the hunt for suspects continues but nothing substantial has come to their notice so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/police-yet-to-find-evidence-of-firing-at-bjp-mps-house/articleshow/87768176.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Dum Dum airport's domestic terminal to get liquor off-shop||KOLKATA: The Dum Dum airport, one of the oldest in Asia, will soon have its first liquor off-shop in the domestic terminal, like its counterpart in Delhi has for the past few years.  A source said talks were on with the Airports Authority of India and state excise department for an off-shop in the domestic terminal. “The off-shop will be managed by the state beverage corporation, Bevco. It (Bevco) has permission for retail trade as well but since its inception, the corporation has never tried its hand in retail. This will be the first retail venture for Bevco,” said the source. According to the official, one of the reasons behind setting up the off-shop could be that the prices of most bottled in origin (BIO) single malt, blended Scotch, vodka and gin and overseas spirits bottled in India (OSBI) in Bengal have become very competitive. “Prices of some single malt and blended Scotch whisky in the domestic terminal shop—same as that in Bengal—would be even cheaper than those available at the Delhi duty free shop in the international terminal. Lots of people used to buy expensive liquors (BIO) from outside as five litres per person is allowed in airlines but now, that will stop,” added sources. The excise department did not comment but later, excise commissioner Umasankar S said the recent slash in prices would help check smuggling and would not affect the revenue of the government. According to him, the excise department seized 1.6 lakh litres of non-duty paid IMFL in the fiscal from April to October 31 in Bengal. “The price slash would help restrict the entry of spurious and duplicate liquor from neighboring states and check smuggling of non-duty paid IMFL. The rationalization of the duty structure here would also help avoid public health hazards,” he added. According to Umasankar S, the new prices were lower than that in Jharkhand and Odisha. The excise commissioner also admitted there has been a fall in consumption in the last one year. There has been a hike in duty on IMFL twice in 2020. The revenue from excise in the first half of this fiscal (2021-22) was Rs 5,471 crore while it was Rs 4,328 crore in the same period last fiscal (2020-21). The total revenue from excise for the state was Rs 12,300 crore in 2020-21. Prices of IMFL, beer, bottled in origin liquor (BIO), overseas spirits bottled in India (OSBI) and wine has come came down by 20%-30%. For beer, the fall is marginal (5%-6%) but for some IMFL registered with excise, the price slash is by even 30%. According to the prices registered with excise so far, rates of some leading premium and semi-premium whisky brands have been slashed by 30% from Rs 1,350 for a 750ml-bottle to Rs 920. For deluxe whisky brands, the fall is 25%-26% from Rs 980 to Rs 710. For popular rum brands, the fall is 15%-18% from Rs 640-650 to Rs 540. Prices of some overseas spirits bottled in India has come down by over 30% from Rs 2,290 a bottle to Rs 1,640, while for some BIOs, the drop is by 35%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/domestic-terminal-to-get-liquor-off-shop/articleshow/87767530.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Former Olympian race walker and coach says Uttarakhand govt gave him half of promised prize money||DEHRADUN: Race walker Gurmeet Singh, who has participated in the 2012 and 2016 Olympics and was part of the recent Tokyo Olympics as a coach, has alleged that the Uttarakhand government has only given him half of the promised prize money for his achievements. Having coached race walking stars -- Priyanka Goswami and Sandeep Kumar -- and eventually booking their place in the Tokyo Olympics, the former Olympian said, “I should have got Rs 11 lakh by 2016-17 but the government hasn't given me the entire amount to date. I have only got half the amount.” The Bajpur resident claimed that according to the state’s sports policy framed in 2014, he should have got Rs 10 lakh for winning a gold medal in the 20km race walk event at the Asian Race Walking Championship held in March 2016 in Japan and another Rs 1 lakh for participating in the World Championship in May 2016 in Italy. “Government paid me as per the 2016 prize money policy, whereas I should have got the promised cash prize as per the 2014 policy,” Singh said, contending that since the new policy came into effect in December 2016, a few months after his wins, he should be given prize money as per the old policy. The new policy halved the entitlement of prize money laid down in the 2014 policy. Refuting the former Olympian’s accusations, a state government official cited a government order issued in December 2016 which said that ”all previous orders regarding the prize money amount are cancelled and the athletes who are yet to get any prize money, even for the events that took place before December 2016, will be paid as per the amount mentioned in the order issued in December 2016 for the implementation of the amended sports policy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/former-olympian-race-walker-and-coach-says-ukhand-govt-gave-him-half-of-promised-prize-money/articleshow/87765803.cms||Mohammad Anab

The dairy has a daily collection of 15.5 lakh litre of milk and supplies it to Mumbai and Pune. The dairy used to get complaints of milk adulteration. According to authorities, the common mode of adulteration was piercing the pouch and drawing the milk out using a syringe. The pouch is then filled up with water. Vishwas Patil, chairman of the dairy said, “With the new packaging, if the pouch is pierced a blue colour applied to one of the layers will spread automatically. It will impart a dark colour on the pouch which will be a sign for customers to understand that the milk is adulterated. Right now the packaging will be used for the milk sold in Mumbai and slowly it will be used for other places as well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-gokul-launches-5-layer-polyfilm-milk-packaging/articleshow/87767541.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Construction halted, but dust flies in face of ban||NEW DELHI: With the worsening air quality, the authorities have put a ban on construction activities and directed agencies to take adequate measures to prevent dust pollution. However, on-ground efforts seem to be inadequate. Though the municipal corporations and government agencies claim to have stepped up efforts and issued challans for not following the norms to control dust, TOI saw construction material and dug up soil lying in the open and dust flying when it visited a few sites. At the Pragati Maidan site near Bhairon Marg-Ring Road intersection, the Public Works Department (PWD) had covered the construction area at some points with green drapes, but most areas remained exposed. Dust was seen rising as no water was being sprinkled. Though PWD had installed an anti-smog gun, it was not functioning on Wednesday afternoon. A similar scene prevailed at the Barapullah Phase-III construction site on the Yamuna floodplain near Mayur Vihar-I. Dug-up soil was lying uncovered along with construction material and machinery. No green drapes were visible there. At a distance, smoke was seen billowing out, giving rise to speculation of garbage being burnt there. According to National Green Tribunal (NGT) guidelines, biomass burning is strictly prohibited. Since the Barapullah construction site is surrounded by crop fields, dust could be seen flying there. There were no preventive measures being taken, no anti-smog gun was there and the area was not covered. Commuters complained about dust pollution saying the ongoing construction was responsible for it. However, the situation was slightly better at Ring Road near Indraprastha Metro Station next to the headquarters of World Health Organisation. The construction agency had covered the area with blue plastic sheets and an anti-smog gun was deployed at the site. Construction material was also covered there. Iqbal Singh, a senior PWD official, said adequate precautions were being taken to tackle pollution at the construction sites. “There is a smog gun installed at Bhairon Marg-Ring Road junction. There are four more smog guns in different sectors, including Mathura Road. They are operated at an interval of a few hours. We are also taking additional pollution-control measures, like covering sites to ensure that dust doesn’t spread,” he added. Experts said dust pollution from C&D waste was one of the major contributing factors in the overall pollution levels of the city. “Solutions like anti-smog guns are limited to small areas as most of the big infrastructure is linear. There is a requirement of mobile sprinklers or smog guns instead of the fixed ones that are being used currently,” said Rajneesh Sareen from CSE. “Dust contributes to about 18% of total PM2.5 share of Delhi’s air. These fine particles go deep into the lungs and even the bloodstream and cause health problems,” said Shambhavi Shukla, assistant programme manager, air pollution, CSE.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/construction-halted-but-dust-flies-in-face-of-ban/articleshow/87767535.cms||Kushagra Dixit
---||Jaipur||Schools reopen with 100% capacity but Covid cases rising||Jaipur: The gradual rise in Covid cases at a time when the state has allowed schools to run with 100% capacity has left parents and the institutes in a fix. Rajasthan is among a few states that have reopened schools with 100% capacity. Maharashtra, Gujarat and Odisha have allowed just the senior classes to function. Officials said they were monitoring the Covid situation daily and if needed they would reconsider the decision or revert to 50% attendance. Reopening of schools from November 15 has divided the parents and schools over the safety and security of children. While officials said the decision was fully backed by a panel of experts, parents questioned who would monitor schools if they were following all protocols. “In the first three days, 33 out of 40 attended classes in my son’s class. I think the government should not have opened the classes for the remaining session,” said Nitesh Sharma, whose son studies in class VI. Jameel Khan, director of a group of schools, said they had been getting calls from parents demanding complete assurance. “In our schools, we have been taking utmost care by allowing only those staff who are fully vaccinated, but what if any child is infected from outside. It is a collective responsibility of schools, parents and the government to create a sustainable environment for offline classes,” said Khan. Defending the government’s move, RK Gupta, senior professor of paediatrics, Sawai Man Singh Medical College, said reopening of schools was in line with the global call by WHO and UNICEF to take necessary steps for starting offline classes. “The well-defined protocols have been in place of following social distancing, handwashing, no overcrowding, proper sanitation, compulsory face masks and no overcrowding with strict monitoring by sample test. The defined method is universally being followed to contain the spread,” said Gupta.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Alipore court holds actor Nusrat Jahan’s marriage with businessman Nikhil Jain ‘legally invalid’||KOLKATA: An Alipore civil court on Wednesday ruled actor-MP Nusrat Jahan’s wedding with businessman Nikhil Jain two years ago “legally not valid”. “It is declared that the alleged marriage held on 19/06/2019 at Bodrum, Turkey in between the plaintiff and the defendant is not legally valid,” read the order by the civil judge (senior division), second court in Alipore. “That marriage in question was never registered in Turkey…. That their alleged marriage did not take place following any religious practice and that inter-faith marriage between a Hindu and a Muslim has no legal sanctity under any personal law prevailed in India. That the parties to the suit never got married under the Special Marriage Act and so, their consensual union cannot be treated as a marriage,” the order read. TOI called and sent messages to Nusrat Jahan multiple times but there was no response from her.  Jain told TOI he was feeling relieved after the order and considered it the best gift on his birthday. “I had appealed for an annulment of marriage before the court in March this year after Nusrat walked out of the marriage and declared it didn’t mean anything to her. I am happy the court has ruled in my favour and has set both of us free from the complex relationship we were in,” said Jain. After winning the Lok Sabha elections in 2019 on a Trinamool ticket, Jahan hosted a wedding reception at a five-star hotel in Kolkata, which was attended by dignitaries. After that, Jain said, they lived together as husband and wife and introduced themselves as a married couple. But in the latter half of 2020, their relationship allegedly turned sour and Jahan left Jain’s flat in November. By June 2021, Jahan had started talking about her marriage having no legal sanctity. Since the birth of her son in August, she has been living with actor Yash Dasgupta, who is stated as the boy’s father in birth certificate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nusrat-marriage-legally-not-valid/articleshow/87767555.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Mumbai||Crime branch gets nod to declare ex-Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh absconder||MUMBAI: A magistrate’s court on Wednesday allowed a plea by crime branch to declare former city police chief Param Bir Singh and two others as absconding accused and issue a proclamation against them in an alleged extortion case where they threatened a businessman and hotelier and extorted money. Crime branch on Monday moved the plea against Param, Vinay Singh and Chhota Shakeel aide Riyaz Bhatti. A proclamation will now be issued in newspapers asking the accused to present themselves before the authorities within 30 days. It will also be pasted at their addresses. “If the accused fail to appear within this time, proceedings can commence for attachment of their properties,” special public prosecutor Shekhar Jagtap said. The plea said a non-bailable warrant was issued by court on October 30, but the trio was not available at their addresses. It alleged that they had gone into hiding after the case was registered. Under section 82 of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), which deals with “proclamation for person absconding”, if any court has reason to believe that a person against whom a warrant has been issued has absconded or is concealing himself so that the warrant cannot be executed, then it may publish a written proclamation requiring him to appear at a specified place. The plea invoked Section 83 of CrPC, through which an absconding accused’s properties can be attached. Last week, the magistrate court issued a non-bailable warrant against Param. This was the third such non-bailable warrant issued against him. Earlier, a Thane court and the 37th metropolitan court issued non-bailable warrants against Param in connection with two extortion cases registered against him and others. Crime branch said cops had gone to Param’s Malabar Hill home on November 10 but due to his absence, the warrant could not be served. The statements of a police guard stationed at the building and the cook were recorded. The guard told them that for three months, Param had not come to the building. He said Param’s family also did not live there, and he did not know their whereabouts. The cook said he had been living and working in the building for over a year. He too said that neither Param nor his family had been to the premises in three months. Vinay Singh’s wife told cops he had not been to their Kandivli apartment since the FIR was registered. She claimed that he had not been in touch with her. The woman said she was unaware about his current location. At Bhatti’s Versova home, his wife too gave a similar statement. Mumbai Police had formed a special investigation team to probe the extortion case against Param and a separate case of similar nature (not related to him), which was being handled by Unit IX of crime branch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-crime-branch-gets-nod-to-declare-param-absconder/articleshow/87767561.cms||Rebecca Samervel

According to a message circulated to parents by Jayshree Periwal International School authorities, a primary class student has been found infected with the virus. The message reads: “A child from grade ..., has tested COVID positive. The child was using personal transport and is a day scholar. We recommend that if your child shows any symptoms, they should be tested. In view of this, Grade ... will remain closed tomorrow (November 18) as we prepare for online classes. (sic).” TOI has withheld the grade of the student. As per the message, offline classes from pre-primary and primary will remain closed on Thursday. TOI repeatedly made phone calls and even sent text messages to the school principal for a statement, but there was no response. Sunil Yadav, president of All Rajasthan Parents Forum, said this is the second school where a child was found to be Covid positive. A day earlier, the SMS School confirmed that two of its students tested positive. “The government’s decision of reopening school with 100% capacity without giving an option of online classes is showing its impact now. Students are getting infected with Covid, risking the lives. Government should make schools provide options for online and offline classes to students. Or else schools will put our children in danger,” said Yadav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/another-student-of-a-pvt-school-tests-ve/articleshow/87768195.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Fadnavis became restless after losing power: Sharad Pawar||Nagpur: A day after opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis slammed Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) terming it as “most corrupt” in Maharashtra’s history, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar launched a counter attack against him at his home turf stating that he had become restless after losing power. In Nagpur for his three-day tour of Vidarbha, the MVA’s chief architect on Wednesday called on the former chief minister to accept the reality. “I can understand that BJP state president Chandrakant Patil is making such (inflammatory) statements (on Amravati riots), but I am surprised over Fadnavis making them. He shouldn’t stoop to this level.” The octogenarian, however, lauded Union minister Nitin Gadkari stating that he helped everyone irrespective of background or party. Refusing to comment on the riots and Shiv Sena’s demand to ban an organisation allegedly involved in fomenting the trouble, the NCP chief said whatever happened in Tripura, its repercussions should not have taken place in Maharashtra. “It’s a very sensitive issue where some people are trying to give it a communal colour for their obvious political benefits. Whosoever responsible for the riots must be brought to the books. I had asked home minister Dilip Walse Patil to visit Amravati to take stock of the situation,” he said. Defending his close aide and former home minister Anil Deshmukh, Pawar said injustice was meted out to him as the complainant (former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh) went missing and he himself had stated that he had no proof. “It started after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray received a complaint from Singh about instructions to police recover “hafta”. I also received the same complaint, but when I inquired, nothing was found out. Now, Singh may be declared absconder as he is not responding to the cops, but Deshmukh is in jail.” Speaking on MPCC president Nana Patole’s repeated jibes against NCP, the Maratha strongman said his party still followed Mahatma Gandhi and former prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s ideologies, even though they were not the part of Congress. “We are working together in the MVA government and we are more or less similar to Congress. A person, who won Lok Sabha and assembly polls on the BJP ticket, would have the same mentality.” Emphasizing on having a third front at the national level to fight the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led BJP in 2024 general elections, the former Union agriculture minister said he would be meeting Congress president Sonia Gandhi and West Bengal CM Mamta Banerjee during the forthcoming winter session of parliament. “It’s not important who will lead the front, its formation is necessary. We will take people’s help.” On why he supported BJP after 2014 assembly polls, Pawar said it was with a view to create a rift between saffron alliance partners in which they succeeded. On Bollywood star Kangana Ranaut’s controversial statement, the experienced politician said some individuals had a habit to issue such “irresponsible” statements and it would be better to neglect them. “The entire world respects Mahatma Gandhi.” On whether MVA constituents would jointly fight forthcoming civic polls in the state, the NCP chief said it was not yet decided as the elections were held at local level where every party wanted to field their activists. Earlier, Pawar called on the industries and trade bodies to form a state-level federation that would meet the government at regular intervals with their grievances. “There is a need for the government to formulate a policy to compensate small shopkeepers, who always suffer losses during riots. Until regional imbalances exist, the state economy cannot progress. The state leaders need to focus on this aspect. There is a need to strengthen industries like farming for boosting the GDP,” he added. PAWAR SPEAK No clarity on contesting civic polls jointly with Congress & Shiv Sena Need to have state-level federation for industries & trade bodies It should meet government at regular intervals with grievances Better to neglect Kangana Ranaut for her ‘irresponsible’ statements Third front needed to fight BJP’s might in 2024 general elections To meet Sonia Gandhi & Mamta Banerjee during Parliament session Fadnavis shouldn’t stoop too low in desperation after losing power Injustice meted out to former minister Anil Deshmukh, who’s in jail Complainant Singh went missing & has no proof against Deshmukh NCP still follows Mahatma Gandhi & Jawaharlal Nehru’s ideologies Tripura’s repercussions should not have been felt in the state||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fadnavis-became-restless-after-losing-power-sharad-pawar/articleshow/87767566.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

TOI had reported on September 5 that the ED had initiated the process of registering a money laundering investigation against Arora and his group entities. A look out notice was simultaneously issued by the agency to prevent the promoter of the company from leaving the country till pendency of the probe. The Supertech group is facing demolition of its 40-storey twin towers in Noida after the apex court upheld a 2014 judgment of the Allahabad high court ordering the demolition by November 30 this year as it was built violating existing laws in collusion with senior officials of the Noida Authority. All the permissions related to the constructions of the twin towers were granted between 2004 and 2012. However, the Supertech chairman had claimed that there was no illegality in the construction of the twin towers and that all bye laws were followed. In a related investigation, the ED had earlier questioned former chairman and CEO of Noida authority Mohinder Singh along with six other high-ranking former officials of Noida and Greater Noida Authorities for their alleged collusion with builders. Other former officials of the Noida and Greater Noida Authority under investigation of the ED include Manoj Rai and Yashpal Tyagi, both former OSD of Noida Authority, three general manager (GM) level officers of the Greater Noida Authority and one AGM rank officer of Noida Authority. Statements of some of them have already been recorded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ed-conducts-searches-on-9-supertech-premises/articleshow/87767587.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Western Railway to have 20 more fifteen-car services||MUMBAI: Overcrowding in trains will ease a bit as the Western Railway (WR) has decided to replace 20 12-car services with 15-car trains on the slow corridor between Andheri and Virar in December. The WR has been running 46 15-car services on the corridor since April 2021. “We are going to deploy two 15-car trains that will help us run 20 more services,” WR general manager Alok Kansal said, with this, the WR will be able to run 66 15-car slow services on this stretch. Officials said that the introduction of more 15-car rakes will reduce the commuter load in the Andheri-Virar belt and increase the carrying capacity by 25% per rake. The carrying capacity of a 15-car local is 3,000 as against 2,400 of the 12-car train. Running 15-car services on slow corridor became possible between Andheri and Virar after WR spent Rs 70 crore on extending the length of 27 platforms on 14 stations to accommodate longer trains. WR introduced 15-car services between Dadar and Virar in 2009. On January 28, 2011, it extended the services till Churchgate after extending platforms 3 and 4. The 15-car trains, however, do not halt between Dadar and Churchgate due to shorter length of platforms. Officials said it is not feasible to run 15-car rakes on the slow corridor from Andheri towards south Mumbai owing to lack of space at the stations to extend the platforms. And even if the WR runs 15-car rakes, it will have to provide double halts at stations, which is not operationally feasible as it affects train punctuality. Kansal further said, “We will also introduce eight more services of AC train in a couple of days. Thus, total number of AC services on WR will increase to 20.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-wr-to-have-20-more-fifteen-car-services/articleshow/87767574.cms||Manthank Mehta

Simultaneous raid was conducted at his university office in Bodh Gaya. This is perhaps the first such case of vigilance raid against a VC. SVU ADG Nayyar Hasnain Khan said besides corruption, the VC has also been found to be in possession of movable properties of at least Rs2 crore and immovable properties worth Rs1 crore disproportionate to his known sources of income.“We will rope in passport and customs officials for investigation as how he possessed foreign currencies like pound, Australian dollar and riyal and which countries he had travelled to,” Khan said. The ADG said five bank accounts of Prasad have been frozen. “We are also searching for his bank lockers,” he said. Armed with search warrants, the SVU sleuths conducted the raids after lodging an FIR on Tuesday against the VC, his PA-cum-assistant Subodh Kumar, Veer Kunwar Singh University (VKSU) financial officer Om Prakash, Patliputra University registrar Jitendra Kumar, two private firms named M/s Poorva Graphics and Offset Printers and M/s XLICT Software Private Limited, both registered at Tilak Marg, Dali Bagh in Lucknow, UP, and other unknown persons in a case of financial irregularities worth Rs30 crore in the name of getting answer booklets, books and other items printed without any demand or need at the university. Om and Jitendra were on deputation at the MU. The SVU, in its investigation carried out till now, has also found that the printing works were allotted to favourable persons instead of inviting any tender. The SVU sleuths have also found documentary evidences of massive irregularities in recruiting private guards for the university. It is suspected that the two private firms named in the FIR are actually shell firms and were paid on the directions of the VC. Sources said several files related to purchases and guards’ recruitment were recovered from the VC’s residence, which actually should have been in his Bodh Gaya office. The SVU sleuths also came to know from the files recovered that only 47 private guards were working in the university while salaries were being disbursed to 86 guards on paper. In addition, the SVU also seized documents reflecting that remunerations paid to the 47 guards were much less than the amount withdrawn in the name of their salaries. The SVU sources said the VC got MU registrar sacked and its financial advisor and officer transferred several months ago by using his influence in the power corridors when they refused to sign documents for clearing payments. It was after their removal that Om and Jitendra were posted at the MU on deputation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/svu-books-mu-vc-for-rs30cr-fraud/articleshow/87766717.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The 27ft-long ‘baghlah’ vessel being built by M/s Haji PI Ahamed Koya Boat Builders on order from Qatari authorities is a remarkable replica of a dhow from early times as it has been built the traditional way without using even a single nail or metal piece. Instead the teak planks of the dhow are fastened by coir ropes hand sewn through the planks. “The special dhow is an attempt to recreate the dhows used by Arabs and others to sail across the world in the olden times before nails were introduced as fasteners. Qatar government authorities want to showcase their seafaring culture, and this traditional dhow will be showcased at next year’s International Dhow Festival which will coincide with the World Cup. Having the dhow built here as an exhibit during the World Cup is a matter of recognition for our centuries-old shipbuilding tradition as well,” said P O Hashim, managing director of Haji P I Ahamed Koya Boat Builders. He said that while traditional dhow-making itself was a handcrafting exercise, the dhow which is being built using coir ropes for fastening was even more laborious and intricate. “Nilambur teak planks are held together using coir ropes by making 2,500 hand stitches and 5,000 holes on teak wood. Expert workers from Ponnani have been helping our traditional artisans in the traditional technique,” Hashim added. He said that the dhow which is six-ft deep and seven-ft wide will fit inside a 40-ft container and could be shipped anywhere. “I have orders for three more such dhows from Qatar for use in their beach houses, and enquiries from Europe and US. Though it is small, six persons can travel in it,” he said, adding that the dhow will be shipped to Qatar in another two months. Hashim’s family has been into dhow building since 1885 and the company has so far built over 200 dhows to a clientele including Arab rulers, royal family members, wealthy businessmen, companies and for the tourism industry. The dhow is being built by master craftsman Gokul Edathumpadikkal and a dozen other craftsmen. “The traditional dhow making using coir ropes is being attempted after a gap of over 500 years. It is more difficult to make than other traditional dhows,” Gokul said. Fish oil will be applied to the ropes to ensure that it retains the strength when it comes in contact with seawater, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/dhow-from-koz-to-be-showcased-in-qatar-during-fifa-world-cup/articleshow/87767581.cms||---

RVNL is implementing most of the city’s Metro projects, but Metro Railway is the umbrella organization which is responsible for operations and execution of the city’s rapid transit system. A 5km section between Hemanta Mukherjee station at Ruby crossing and the Kavi Subhas terminal at Sonarpur, of the 32km Metro project which will join Kavi Subhas with Airport via EM Bypass and New Town, is veering towards commissioning next year. Even as tracks have been laid along most of the 5km viaduct, and some stations like JN Nandi at Mukundapur on EM Bypass are getting finishing touches, there’s still a 120m gap at the Avishikta crossing that is now being filled up. Joshi and his team started at 10.30am, checking out the work progress of the Kavi Subhas terminal. He inspected the rake-reversal arrangements here and visited the passenger-interchanging points between the old and new Kavi Subhas Metro stations as well as New Garia station of Eastern Railway. Kavi Subhas will be a crucial terminal where the north-south line and the New Garia-Airport lines will meet. Joshi took stock of the progress of the construction of the double discharge platforms and the carshed next to the terminal. Later, he inspected the Satyajit Ray, JN Nandi, Hemanta Mukherjee, Kavi Sukanta, Beliaghata and Salt Lake Sector V stations. Joshi also discussed the action plan for completion of work at critical locations where discontinuities of viaduct are needed to be bridged. The GM reviewed the passenger interchanging arrangements at Salt Lake Sector V station with East-West Metro.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/metro-inspection-ajanta/articleshow/87766721.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

A total of five persons tested positive for Covid-19 in Jaipur on Wednesday. One case each was reported from Chandpole, Civil Lines, Govindgarh, Mansatovar and Vaishali Nagar. In the last six days, the city has reported 46 Covid-19 cases. The order was issued by health secretary Vaidhav Galriya and it asked officials to increase Covid-19 testing. Directions have also been issued to conduct contact tracing. Officials have been asked to take random samples from crowded places, schools and hospitals, where patients are coming in with influenza-like illnesses. "We are collecting samples daily in increased numbers. We have increased it to 3,000 and we will increase it to 5,000 in coming days. We are collecting samples from schools and crowded places and conducting contact tracing as well," said Dr Narrottam Sharma, chief medical health officer (Jaipur-I). Over the past few days, areas such as C-scheme, Raja Park, Bani Park, Vaishali Nagar have been witnessing Covid-19 cases. "We collected 14 samples from the school, where two children were found infected with the virus. No one has tested positive yet from the school," said Dr Sharma. In the state, 11 persons were found infected with Covid-19 on Wednesday taking its overall tally to 9,54,550. No death was reported. The state’s toll stands at 8,954. The health department is also focusing on increasing Covid-19 vaccination. Those who have not yet received their second doses and have become eligible to get it have been asked to get jabbed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-to-opt-for-five-fold-strategy-amid-marginal-rise-in-covid-cases/articleshow/87768202.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Health experts stress need for Cov shot to kids at the earliest||Kolkata: Inoculation of children against Covid-19 should be started at the earliest, feel health experts, especially now that schools have reopened for in-person classes. One vaccine has already received emergency use authorisation (EUA) and another one is awaiting the approval, but the government is yet to announce the roll-out of an inoculation drive for children. But with schools re-opening their campuses in phases, doctors as well as parents want vaccine protection for the paediatric population. “Morbidity and mortality from the novel coronavirus is less among children and so, adults have been given the priority in the inoculation drive. But now that schools have started re-opening, children must be administered vaccine at the earliest,” said senior paediatrician Apurba Ghosh, director at Institute of Child Health (ICH) Kolkata. While Zydus Cadila’s three-dose ZyCov-D has received authorization for children between 12 and 18 years, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin has been recommended for EUA for children above 2 years by the subject expert committee. The vaccine is still awaiting the final nod from the drug regulator. “Re-opening of educational institutes was much needed. But even a single child contracting the novel coronavirus will lead to panic among parents and might again cause suspension of physical classes. We need to provide vaccine protection to children as fast as possible,” said IPGMER hepatolgy head Abhijit Chowdhury, also a member of Bengal’s Global Advisory Board for Covid-19 Response. Paediatricians and hospitals are already flooded with enquiries about vaccination for children. “Almost 100% parents are keen on their children getting the jab. Since the adults have received the shots, they are aware of the benefits. Being away from classrooms for a long period was causing chldren psychological issues. But as schools have started reopening in phases, it is high time children were administered the vaccine,” said ICH professor Jaydeep Choudhury, the co-investigator in the ZyCov-D clinical trial at ICH. Swasthya Bhawan official feel the health ministry may announce the roll-out of the paediatric inoculation drive only after Covaxin receives the sanction. State health officials said they were ready for the roll-out and were waiting for the guidelines. “In Bengal, about 2.45 crore children above 2 years will be eligible for th vaccine. Our infrastructure is ready. We only need the guideline on certain issues, like the type of vaccine and the procurement procedure,” said state family welfare officer Asim Das Malakar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/health-experts-stress-need-for-cov-shot-to-kids-at-the-earliest/articleshow/87767636.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

A L Quadros, senior most leader from Mumbai Taximen's Union, said he will petition the government to give “subsidy” to cabbies to purchase new electric taxis at low rates and also strengthen the e-charging infrastructure across Mumbai so that they can recharge batteries or swap them at convenient locations across the island city and suburbs. At present, CNG rate has increased by around Rs 10 per kg, escalating the operational expenses for cab owners by 20% despite getting a fare hike, he said. In comparison, the operational and maintenance cost for electric cabs was very low -- at least 50% savings as compared to CNG fuel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-kaali-peeli-drivers-want-e-cabs-over-cng-says-union/articleshow/87767619.cms||Somit Sen

He is one among seven other speakers from the country which include Rajasthan’s C P Joshi, Meghalaya’s Metbah Lyngdoh, Girish Gautam of Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu’s M Appavu and Biswajit Daimary of Assam. Mahto addressed the 82nd conference in Shimla on Wednesday and highlighted some of the achievements of Jharkhand assembly besides proposing to host national youth parliament here. Excerpts from his statement. Our Founding Fathers of the nation gifted us an outstanding Constitution that paved the way for a democratic India. We must never forget that millions of brave men and women fought their way for our beloved nation’s independence. As an institution, legislatures have the utmost responsibility to uphold the democracy in our nation. We have witnessed a consistent trend over the years that the functioning period of legislatures has reduced considerably compared to the early decades of Indian independence. Legislatures are an important pillar of the nation’s foundation. The reduced functioning of the legislatures may not augur well for the overall stature and role that the legislative institutions are supposed to play in nation building. As elected representatives, our utmost responsibility is towards the people of the country who have sent us to the legislature to work towards ensuring the progress of our society and country. The Jharkhand legislative assembly, in the short span of 21 years, has put forth various examples of innovations in parliamentary practices. Chief Minister’s Question Hour is one such innovation where members can ask questions on policy matters directly to the chief minister. Untouched questions committee has been formed to take up the questions which could not be asked on the floor of the house due to the paucity of time. Provision for a government assurance committee is also made to look into the assurances made on the floor of the house. Benefits of these innovations are clearly felt by the members in raising questions of public importance and leading them up to a final conclusive culmination. As speaker, I had set out three priorities — to utilise the maximum time of the session, making it more efficient and productive. For this purpose, apart from other efforts, we are also trying to implement e-vidhan in our assembly as early as possible. Efforts are being made by my secretariat in this direction and we are getting required support from the central and state governments. I have also decided to bring the house proceedings and other activities of the assembly before the common people. Taking this objective into account, I have started Jharkhand Vidhan Sabha TV on YouTube and I am constantly trying to make it better and more beneficial to the people. I have also decided to make our younger generations more aware about our parliamentary procedures, so that on the one hand they will have greater faith in our democratic principles, and on the other, it will inculcate leadership qualities in them. Towards this goal we organised a Chhatra Sansad in our assembly in which actual house proceedings were conducted by the students. They ran question hour and a bill was introduced and passed by their assembly too. To signify the importance of environment, the theme of the event was ‘Youth for Green Jharkhand’ and the bill that was passed by this assembly was the Tree Conservation Bill. This house was also gender equal as more than 50% of participants were female. We have sent a proposal to organise an all-India event starting with 10 states in the first round. I hope we will get the Hon’ble Speaker’s consent for it.

The state department of forests, environment and wildlife has set rolling a plan to develop its sprawling 540 acre biodiversity park in Lalkhatanga on the outskirts of the state capital into an ecotourism site of international standards. Last month, the office of Ranchi divisional forest officer (DFO) floated an expression of interest (EoI) inviting consultancy firms across the country to chalk up a plan for developing the park. As per the department sources, a consultancy firm based in New Delhi has been shortlisted through a technical bidding process. Ranchi DFO Ashok Dubey said, “Since the vision is to develop the park into an ecotourism site of international standards, it needs technical expertise. A firm has been shortlisted and a proposal for appointing it has been sent to the government.” Forest officials said the planning for developing the park into an ecotourism site began after chief minister Hemant Soren visited the facility earlier this year. “After taking a tour of the park, the CM instructed the department officials to consider developing the park and its surrounding areas into an ecotourism site complete with adventure sports and tourism,” a senior department official said. The park, which is over a decade old, is home to several indigenous and medicinal plant varieties. Primarily maintained by the department for educational purposes, the park is a popular getaway destination for locals and tourists. “If it becomes an ecotourism centre, the park will become a popular attraction for tourists both from Jharkhand and other parts of the country. It will also contribute to the local economy and provide livelihood to those living in its vicinity,” Dubey said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/forest-dept-eyes-540-acre-ecotourism-site-in-ranchi/articleshow/87766214.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||Air quality of four Jharkhand cities categorised as ‘very unhealthy’||Ranchi: People in major cities of Jharkhand are suffering from allergies, runny nose and irritation of respiratory tract but are clueless about the reasons. Medical experts are also not in a position to officially link them with air pollution in the absence of scientific data. The air quality index (AQI) monitor near Van Bhavan in Ranchi recorded PM10 levels at 143.61 and PM2.5 at 84.84 on Wednesday around 4 pm. Under medical standards, AQI in the range of 100-149 is considered unhealthy while it is classified as extremely unhealthy in the range of 150-249 followed by “dangerous” in the range of 250 and above. In contrast to levels recorded at the AQI monitor of Jharkhand state pollution control board, private agencies monitoring the levels pegged all the parameters at a very high level. According to Accuweather which collects information from France-based plume labs, monitoring air quality on a regular basis, Ranchi recorded AQI 215 on Wednesday, categoried as “very unhealthy”. The PM2.5 at 191, was also poor while NoX (nitrogen oxides) and ground-level ozone were found to be in fair category in the range of 45 and 36 respectively. AQI in Jamshedpur was recorded at 207, while in Bokaro and Dhanbad it was 193 and 184 respectively. In all the four cities, particulate matters both in the PM10 and PM 2.5 category were at concerning levels while carbon monoxide levels were in “excellent” category. Ashish Sheetal, general secretary of Yugantar Bharti, an NGO working in the field of environment conservation, said the disparity in AQI levels is mainly due to unscientific installation of the monitoring equipment. “The AQI depends on which sample of air is being monitored. We recommend three monitors placed at triangle to monitor the air of a particular area so that a big sample of air is monitored instead of single monitor which can miss real sample if the wind direction is blowing away from the monitor,” he said. Asked what explains lower SOX, NOX and CO levels, mostly attributed to vehicular and industrial pollutants but higher range of PM10 and PM2.5 pollutants in the cities of Jharkhand, Sheetal said a lot comes from construction work and unpaved road sides adding to dust in the air. “Vehicular and industrial pollution also adds to PM2.5 and PM10 pollutants but coal mines and stone crushers are the major culprits,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/air-quality-of-four-jharkhand-cities-categorised-as-very-unhealthy/articleshow/87766186.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

JMM workers blocked the entrance gates of Tata Motors plant in Telco, Tata Steel plant in Bistupur, Tata Growth shop in Gamharia and Tata Steel Long Products Limited (TSPL) iron ore mines in Noamundi for 12 hours besides staging demonstrations outside Tata Cummins. The party workers were led by nine incumbent JMM legislators from Kolhan division. During the peaceful sit-in, JMM demanded that Tata Sons shift its corporate head offices to Jamshedpur from Mumbai. JMM lawmaker Ramdas Soren said: “Factories are operating here. So the headquarters should also be based here as it will fetch Jharkhand better revenues.” Baharagora MLA Sanjiv Sardar demanded that the conglomerate should fill up its vacancies by employing the adivasis and moolvasis of the state. Jugsalai MLA Mangal Kalindi said: “At present, Tata Motors and several other companies procure ancillary products from other states depriving work to the local ancillary units.” The party leadership also appealed to Tata Cummins not to shift its PAN (permanent account number) jurisdiction. JMM workers staged protest with bows, arrows and party banners and raised slogans. They were served khichdi and vegetables during lunch hours. The party had provisioned khichdi for 20,000 participants, a local worker said. The conglomerate did not issue any statement till evening. The East Singhbhum administration, however, had pressed in a large number of police personnel and riot-control vehicles at the protest sites. SSP M Tamil Vanan said that adequate security arrangements have been made for the gate jaam protest. While Tata Group remained silent, local entrepreneurs reacted sharply to Wednesday’s protests. “At a time when the state government is making renewed efforts to fetch big ticket investments in the state, the protests will not send a good signal to the prospective investors,” Adityapur Small Industries Association (ASIA) president Santosh Khetan said. The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) sought chief minister Hemant Soren’s intervention into the Tata Cummins issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jmm-protests-outside-tata-factories-in-jamshedpur/articleshow/87766278.cms||B Sridhar

The sexagenarian Maoist leader, who has been active in the ultra Left wing for more than three decades, suffered from convulsions soon after being detained by police. The couple was taken to Seraikela Sadar hospital for a medical check-up on November 14 before being produced in the sub-divisional judicial magistrate’s court. Doctors advised her to go for a thorough checkup and treatment at Rims. Public relations officer at Rims DK Sinha confirmed that Sheela had an epileptic episode following which she was brought to the hospital. “She has been admitted to the medicine ward and kept under police security. Some of the tests were conducted and further treatment would be decided by the doctors,” he said. Sheela, accused in more than a dozen criminal cases, has been booked under sections 420, 467,468 and 471 of the IPC along with section 17 of Criminal Law Amendment Act and sections 10 and 13 of Unlawful Activities Prevention Act in the recent case registered with Kandra police station.

At first, Ajay Parmar thought that it was a baby crocodile but soon he realised that it was something else. Parmar was thrilled as what he had spotted turned out to be an otter in the middle of the lake. “I have been visiting this wetland for the last two decades to watch and click birds. This is for the first time that an otter has been spotted at Wadhwana. It was a delight to watch a freshwater otter swim in the lake,” Parmar, who photographed the otter along with Ankit Shah, told TOI. “Otters have been spotted in Mahi and even Narmada but never has this mammal been spotted at this lake,” he said. Otters are carnivorous mammals that feed on fishes, crabs and frogs. Efficient hunters, freshwater otters have webbed feet and a long flat tail that helps it propel through the water. “Though I saw just one otter, I feel that it must be having its family around. Narmada is connected to Wadhwana so it is possible that the otter must have swam through the canal to this lake,” Parmar added. “The otter, even if a loner, may stay in the lake for a long time as the wetland is a good source of food. I managed to get a few clicks when the adult otter climbed on a little island for a while before slipping away in the waters,” he said. Avid bird watcher, Kartik Upadhyay said that he too never heard of an otter being seen at Wadhwana in all the years that he visited the wetland.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/freshwater-otter-clicked-at-wadhwana-birders-claim-first-sighting-at-wetland/articleshow/87766375.cms||Tushar Tere

In my opinion, the missionaries contribute as much as 50% to the state’s education system,” Soren said in his address as the chief guest at the 50th anniversary of Ranchi’s Gossner College. “I, along with my brothers (deceased former Jama legislator Durga Soren and incumbent Dumka MLA Basant Soren), studied for some time in a missionary school in Dumka during the 1980s. We stayed at the school hostel. Though I lived in cities like New Delhi, Bokaro, Ranchi and Patna, memories from the mission school days are still fresh in my mind,” Soren said. Gossner College, which is run by the Gossner Evalgelical Lutheran church, was founded in 1972. It currently has 27 departments. Together with Gossner school, it imparts education to roughly 9,000 students. Soren said: “Covid-19 has affected the education of the children. The world switched to online classes. During the pandemic, the missionaries went the extra mile to lend a helping hand to the tribal communities living in the hinterlands of the state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/missionaries-contribution-to-jharkhands-education-pivotal-hemant/articleshow/87766311.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

These will include activities such as hop-on-hop-off buses and amphibious tour vehicles. While a hop-on-hop-off bus was operational until the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, GTDC’s plan to introduce amphibious vehicles, that operate on sea as well as land, was delayed owing to difficulties faced by the previous service provider in getting mandatory permissions. Now that a new service provider has been selected, GTDC expects to make both services operational during the current season. A tourism official said the hop-on-hop-off service had slowly become quite popular among domestic tourists. A significant number of foreign tourists, too, were seen using the service. A ride on the double decker bus, that offered an air conditioned and an open sky section, was a fun trip for many and a different experience from the coaches or buses that offer tours. “The beauty of this service is that passengers can decide their itinerary. The elements of flexibility and choice make a difference,” he said. Now with the tourism season looking promising, and with the overall pandemic situation largely under control, he said they are hoping to have the bus back on the road soon. The official said that had their plan for the amphibious bus service succeeded in 2016, Goa would have become the first state to have introduced it. However, even after having a trial, the service provider was unable to start the services due to problems in obtaining permissions from various authorities. “With it being a new kind of service in India then, government authorities were reluctant to give permission,” he said. Power Minister Nilesh Cabral, who was the GTDC chairperson then, had tried very hard to get the new service moving.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gtdc-appoints-new-service-provider-for-multimodal-tours/articleshow/87767661.cms||---
---||India||Supreme Court names retired judge of Punjab and Haryana HC to monitor Kheri probe||NEW DELHI: "To ensure transparency, fairness and absolute impartiality" in the investigations into the Lakhimpur Kheri incidents resulting in eight deaths, the Supreme Court on Wednesday appointed retired Punjab and Haryana HC judge Rakesh Kumar Jain to supervise the probe and reconstituted the Special Investigation Team (SIT) by inducting three senior IPS officers. A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli said, "While investigating such offences, justice must not only be done, but also be seen and perceived to be done. We, thus, deem it appropriate to reconstitute the SIT hereafter to preserve the faith and trust of people in the administration of the justice system." It appointed UP cadre IPS officer S B Shiradkar, who is a native of Nanded in Maharashtra, to head the SIT and drafted in two other UP-cadre IPS officers, also hailing from outside the state, to the probe team. "Further, to assure full and complete justice to the victims of crime, we are inclined to order that the ongoing investigation be monitored by a retired HC Judge, who too may not have his roots in Uttar Pradesh. We, therefore, appoint Justice (retd) Rakesh Kumar Jain of the P&H HC to monitor the ongoing investigation so as to ensure transparency, fairness and absolute impartiality in the outcome of the investigation into the Lakhimpur Kheri incident which is to be conducted in a time bound manner." The CJI-led bench said it would post the matter for further hearing after Justice Jain submits a status report subsequent to the SIT filing chargesheets in the three separate incidents on October 3, which the court described in this manner - "Several protesters had been blocking the road to restrict passage for the UP Deputy Chief Minister who was on his way to Banbirpur village. While standing and/or walking on the road, these protesters were rammed from behind by a Mahindra Thar SUV, and then run over by the same vehicle. Two other vehicles that were part of the same convoy also ran over those who had already been thrown to the ground and crushed by the first SUV. The incident resulted in eight deaths and several suffered injuries." Four farmers were mowed down by the vehicles leading to an angry mob lynching three accused persons. A journalist too was murdered. SC during the last hearing had expressed dissatisfaction over the composition of the SIT, which predominantly consisted of middle level/subordinate level police officers, and had sought names of directly recruited IPS officers of UP cadre who are not natives of the state. Apart from Shiradkar, the CJI-led bench inducted Padmaja Chauhan and Preetinder Singh in the SIT. The bench justified its decision to reconstitute the SIT by saying, "It appears to us that in spite of their (existing members of SIT) perceived commitment and sincerity in carrying out the investigation, there may still be a lurking suspicion in respect of the fairness and independence of such an investigation. We, therefore, deem it appropriate to direct re­constitution of the SIT infused with directly recruited IPS officers who do not hail from Uttar Pradesh, though are allocated to UP Cadre." "The newly constituted SIT shall be free to seek assistance from, and/or associate with or include the local police of Lakhimpur Kheri for taking the ongoing investigations to its logical conclusion under the continuous monitoring of Justice Jain. The SIT shall make all efforts to conclude the investigation expeditiously and file the charge­sheet...

Councillors Archana Dangui and Jaya Sawant are in fray. A no-trust motion was moved against Dhavlikar by eight councillors of the 15-member body on October 11. However, the council had referred the decision to director of municipal administration (DMA) Gurudas Pilarnkar who termed the motion as defeated on October 13. In his order, Pilarnkar stated that since there were only seven councillors out of the 15-member council, the motion could not seek a majority. He said it was necessary that all eight members should have been present for the special meeting to vote on the motion. The BJP-led Ponda Nagrik Samiti had rewarded Virendra Dhavlikar with the post of PMC deputy chairperson on October 21, 2020. Orally it was decided that he would vacate the chair in six months and allow other colleagues an opportunity to become vice-chairperson. However, he did not vacate the chair for about a year, following which the motion was moved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ponda-council-to-elect-new-deputy-today/articleshow/87767798.cms||---
