Meanwhile, a little-known outfit Mujahideen Ghazwatul Hind, while claiming responsibility for an "attack", said three of its cadres have "attacked the CRPF camp". Earlier in the day, an encounter broke out in Kulgam district of south Kashmir. The officials said acting on specific inputs about the presence of militants in Chawalgam area of Kulgam, security forces launched a cordon and search operation there. As the forces were conducting the searches in the area, the militants fired upon them, they said. The forces retaliated leading to an encounter in which a militant was killed, the officials said.

There is no such decision of a general amnesty,” Yusuf said in a TV interview. At the same time, Yusuf’s statement during the interview that “no such decision has been taken yet” does not completely rule out such a possibility in future. The NSA defended his government’s position, saying that it was talking to the TTP from a position of strength. “The situation has changed in Afghanistan with the Taliban takeover. They are not as antagonistic towards Pakistan as the former president Ashraf Ghani’s government. Now the discussion has started as the support base provided to the TTP by Ghani’s government and India no longer exists,” he said. He alleged that the militant group had been receiving support from India and Afghan intelligence for the last 10-15 years. The talks with the terrorist organisation responsible for thousands of deaths across Pakistan, majority of them innocent civilians, including kids, women and members of minority communities, has created an uproar in Pakistan. The chief justice of Pakistan’s Supreme Court had summoned PM Imran Khan on Wednesday and gave him a tough time in a case related to TTP’s massacre of 132 children and 15 others inside a school in Peshawar in 2014. One of the judges had questioned Khan why “we are bringing them (TTP) back to the negotiating table instead of taking action against them”. The issue of amnesty to TTP members was first raised by President Dr Arif Alvi. Subsequently, foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi linked it with end to terrorist attacks and finally the PM mentioned it during an interview with a foreign TV station, asking the militants to shun militancy, return to the country and start living like normal human beings. Two Afghan figures familiar with the talks said that in return, the TTP have demanded from Pakistan release of their fighters and leaders, control over parts of the tribal regions and rule by their strict interpretation of Islamic Shariah law in those areas, as well as the right to keep their weapons. A conversation with senior defence officials revealed that the decision to ink an agreement with the militants was made after taking into consideration the evolving situation in Afghanistan following the exit of American forces and Taliban seizing the power. One of the officials said that Pakistan has no longer the support of US drones to target the top TTP leaders and fighters having sanctuaries in Afghanistan. The US had eliminated all TTP chiefs since the group’s formation in 2007 and had financially backed Pakistan’s military offensives against the Pakistani Taliban in the restive tribal districts and parts of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in the northwest. Since the group is currently stationed in Afghanistan’s border provinces with Pakistan, some senior defence officials believe, it seems unfeasible and almost impossible to move against it in another country. Despite failure of talks and agreements with terrorists in past, several security officials observed that dialogue was still a better option to address the issue due to lack of other options. Following the return of Taliban to power after 20 years, Islamabad’s foremost demand from the new Afghan rulers was to use their clout to stop the TTP from using their soil for terrorist attacks against Pakistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistans-nsa-denies-offering-amnesty-to-ttp-members/articleshow/87654519.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

On when vaccination for children could start as Zydus Cadila's Covid vaccine has been granted emergency use authorisation for those 12-year-old and above, he said children were not being inoculated against Covid-19 on a large scale anywhere in the world though it has been initiated in some countries in a limited manner. "We do not want to rush this thing. Since this is a matter related to children, the expert group is carrying out further studies," he said at the 'Times Now Summit 2021'. All the vaccines which have currently received emergency use authorisation will be granted full authorisation only after a detailed study and based on the data of four to five years, he said. "It is through data and experience we have learnt that even after vaccination Covid can happen. Then again, data emerged stating that after vaccination one does not get severe Covid. The first dose gives 96 per cent protection and both doses give 98.5 per cent protection. "About vaccinating the children, we will make a decision based on expert opinion. We have decided to think and evaluate before going ahead with vaccinating children as they are the future of our country and we need to tread with caution in this matter," the minister said. On the probability of administering a booster dose, he said adequate stocks are available and the aim is to complete the vaccination of the target population with two doses. After that, a decision on booster dose would be taken based on expert recommendation, Mandaviya said. "The government cannot take a direct decision in such a matter. When the Indian Council of Medical Research and expert team will say that a booster dose should be given, we will consider it then," he said, adding Prime Minister Narendra Modi has always depended on expert opinion, be it vaccine research, manufacturing or approval. Despite a large population and diverse challenges, nearly 80 per cent of India's adult population have taken at least the first dose. The country's vaccination performance has been remarkable, Mandaviya said. About Covaxin's approval by WHO, the minister said that he had discussed the matter with WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on more than a couple of occasions to understand the requirements a vaccine needed to fulfil to get the clearance. "It is a matter of great pride that a vaccine developed and manufactured in India has been given EUA status." Asked if the delay in getting the EUA was because Covaxin is an Indian vaccine and if there was there any discrimination against India, the Mandaviya replied, "I will not get into this matter." He informed that 97 countries have recognised Covishield and Covaxin. In the coming days, vaccines manufactured in India will be made available around the globe at affordable rates, Mandaviya said and stressed India will play a major role in global covid vaccination efforts. "We will get 31 crore doses in November with more due in December. Another five to six companies are set to come to India to manufacture vaccines here. We will help meet the world's requirement for Covid vaccines by providing $18 to 20 vaccines at $3 to 4. This is our commitment," he said. The minister said that 16 crore vaccine doses are lying with the states and Union Territories. Referring to the 'Har Ghar Dastak' vaccination at doorstep campaign, he said, "By December 31 we want to complete our target of vaccinating people aged 18 and above. It now depends on people's support." Asked about the possibility of a third wave, Mandaviya said, "Covid is not over. Cases are rising globally. In Russia, China, Hong Kong cases are rising again despite more than 80 per cent vaccination. Vaccination and Covid-appropriate behaviour have to go hand in hand." On preparations for a probable third wave, he said Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission has been launched and Rs 65,000 crore will be spent in the next five years to ramp up the health infrastructure across the country. The aim is to form such a level of preparedness that India is ready to fight a pandemic-like exigency if anything like it comes up in the next 50 years, the Union health minister said. "The second wave pointed out the shortages in health infrastructure. But, we don't believe in a blame game. PM Modi has linked health with development and the government under his leadership always made efforts to expand and strengthen health facilities," he said Discussing the Health Infrastructure Mission, Mandaviya said modern laboratories will be set up at the district level which will conduct 115 types of medical tests for the poor citizens free of cost. Critical care units will be set up at the district level equipped with a 100-bed facility that has oxygen and ventilators. Besides, a research centre at the regional level will be set up so that epidemics are recognised on time before they assume pandemic proportions, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/dont-want-to-rush-need-to-tread-with-caution-mandaviya-on-giving-covid-vaccine-to-children/articleshow/87654618.cms||---

He also emphasised the need for greater representation by them in the democratic and political arenas. Sawant, who was speaking at the National Youth Parliament, said the state government is committed to grooming the youth in the best possible way to lead the democracy. He made a case for the establishment of private universities in the state, such as design and skills universities, to offer young people a plethora of courses to choose from. Only the youth can achieve Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s goal pertaining to the New India Mission, Sawant said, and added that his government has been working tirelessly to provide the best possible facilities for the betterment of the youth, including a number of schemes that complement the growth and development of young people in Goa. There is special focus on upgrading technical education, the chief minister said, for which various youth-oriented courses have been introduced in schools and colleges to provide practical experiences that help them develop skills the industry requires.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-cm-calls-for-greater-involvement-of-young-people-in-politics/articleshow/87654555.cms||Murari Shetye

The order came on a day when two terrorists were killed in the valley in two separate encounters. One unidentified terrorist was killed in the first encounter between holed-up terrorists and security forces on Thursday morning at Chawalgam area of South Kashmir’s Kulgam district. Reports said a joint team of police and Army personnel launched a cordon-and-search operation in Chawalgam. As the team approached the spot, the hidden terrorists fired upon the forces, triggering off a gunfight. Another unidentified terrorist was killed in a brief encounter at Bemina area of Srinagar late on Thursday evening. Acting on a specific lead about the presence of terrorists near the Bemina police post, a brief shoot-out took place in which an unidentified terrorist was killed, a police official said. Sources said 50 security pickets were removed from various vulnerable areas across Kashmir valley in 2011, besides release of 600 stone pelters, by the then Omar Abdullah government in consultation with former Union home minister P Chidambaram. Authorities removed five such security pickets from various spots in Srinagar city in February this year in the run up to the visit of the European Union delegation. Two of them were removed from Lal Chowk area. Security agencies have even advised to set up security pickets removed between 2011 and 2014. This necessitated bringing in 5,500 more paramilitary personnel to Kashmir last week. The UPA government in 2010 had appointed a three-member interlocutor team, which recommended the removal of the security pickets. Now, with frequent attacks on civilians and members of minority community since October 2 this year, authorities recently re-built two pickets at Barzulla bridge on the way to the Bone and Joint Hospital in Srinagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/security-pickets-removed-by-upa-to-come-up-again-in-jk/articleshow/87654655.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Addressing the annual executive council meeting of NIM, Uttarkashi, via video conferencing, the union minister said the mountaineering expedition and allied activities do not just signify physical endurance but also mental determination and enthusiasm. "Earlier male dominance was observed in this field but now women participation can also be seen. Divyang friends also participate in mountaineering," he said and referred to Arunima Sinha, who is the world's first woman amputee to scale Mt Everest. "The ethics in mountaineering teach us how to protect nature," he said Singh extended his best wishes to NIM for its next expedition to Manaslu, the eighth-highest mountain in the world at 8,163 metres. "NIM, Uttarkashi was established in 1965. The institute is playing a great role in bringing laurels to the country in the field of mountaineering," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mountaineering-signifies-endurance-mental-determination-says-rajnath-singh/articleshow/87654763.cms||---
---||World||Covid-19 hot spots offer sign of what could be ahead for US||The contagious delta variant is driving up Covid-19 hospitalizations in the Mountain West and fueling disruptive outbreaks in the North, a worrisome sign of what could be ahead this winter in the US While trends are improving in Florida, Texas and other Southern states that bore the worst of the summer surge, it’s clear that delta isn’t done with the United States. Covid-19 is moving north and west for the winter as people head indoors, close their windows and breathe stagnant air. “We’re going to see a lot of outbreaks in unvaccinated people that will result in serious illness, and it will be tragic,” said Dr. Donald Milton of the University of Maryland School of Public Health. In recent days, a Vermont college suspended social gatherings after a spike in cases tied to Halloween parties. Boston officials shut down an elementary school to control an outbreak. Hospitals in New Mexico and Colorado are overwhelmed. In Michigan, the three-county metro Detroit area is again becoming a hot spot for transmissions, with nearly 400 Covid-19 patients in hospitals. Mask-wearing in Michigan has declined to about 25% of people, according to a combination of surveys tracked by an influential modeling group at the University of Washington. “Concern over Covid in general is pretty much gone, which is unfortunate,” said Dr. Jennifer Morse, medical director at health departments in 20 central and northern Michigan counties. “I feel strange going into a store masked. I’m a minority. It’s very different. It’s just a really unusual atmosphere right now.” New Mexico is running out of intensive care beds despite the state’s above-average vaccination rate. Waning immunity may be playing a role. People who were vaccinated early and have not yet received booster shots may be driving up infection numbers, even if they still have some protection from the most dire consequences of the virus. “Delta and waning immunity — the combination of these two have set us back,” said Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington. “This virus is going to stick with us for a long, long time.” The delta variant dominates infections across the US., accounting for more than 99% of the samples analyzed. No state has achieved a high enough vaccination rate, even when combined with infection-induced immunity, to avoid the type of outbreaks happening now, Mokdad said. In a deviation from national recommendations, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed an executive order Thursday that allows any resident 18 or older access to a Covid-19 booster shot, another step to prevent hospitals and health care workers from being overwhelmed by the state’s surge in delta infections. Progress on vaccination continues, yet nearly 60 million Americans age 12 and older remain unvaccinated. That’s an improvement since July, when 100 million were unvaccinated, said White House Covid-19 coordinator Jeff Zients. First shots are averaging about 300,000 per day, and the effort to vaccinate children ages 5 to 11 is off to a strong start, Zients said at a briefing Wednesday. Virginia Tech’s Linsey Marr, a leading researcher on the airborne spread of the coronavirus, predicted the northward spread of the virus in a Twitter post September 15. The virus spreads in the air and can build up in enclosed rooms with poor ventilation. Colder weather means more people are indoors breathing the same air, Marr said. Imagine that everyone you spend time with is a smoker and you want to breathe as little of their smoke as possible, she said. “The closer you are to a smoker the more exposure you have to that smoke,” Marr said. “And if you’re in a poorly ventilated room, the smoke builds up over time.” Marr said she and her vaccinated family will use rapid tests before gathering for Christmas to check for infection. “It’s hard to know what’s coming next with this virus,” Marr said. “We thought we knew, but delta really surprised us. We thought the vaccine would help end this, but things are still dragging on. It’s hard to know what’s going to happen next.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/covid-19-hot-spots-offer-sign-of-what-could-be-ahead-for-us/articleshow/87654812.cms||---

---||Delhi||Had a bad haircut, brow cut, wax burn? Delhiites say, ‘You are not alone’||How many times have you been on the verge of a meltdown after a trip to the salon or walked out less than pleased with the service? While most of us may choose to not react even when we want to scream in anger because the stylist has either cut our hair too short, or left a bald spot on our eyebrow, a salon was recently told to pay Rs 2 crore to a model as a punitive award for a haircut that allegedly wasn’t what she had hoped for. The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) awarded this sum to her for a wrong haircut at a salon in a five-star hotel in Delhi in April 2018. The order noted, “According to the complainant, she specifically instructed the hairdresser for long flicks/layers covering her face in the front and at the back and four-inch straight hair trim from the bottom.” The complainant was left in “utter shock and surprise”, when the hairdresser allegedly “chopped off her entire hair, leaving only four inches from the top”. While this may seem like a rare case when a client was awarded this sum for a service gone wrong, such salon experiences are quite common. ‘Such mishaps are common, irrespective of the gender’Parul Sharma, a psychology student, shares, “I went to a luxury salon where I had asked the hairdresser to give me light bangs but he kept on chopping my hair and the final outcome was nothing close to what I had wanted. It ended up looking like Sadhna cut. It was looking terrible and it was my cousin’s wedding. It was so traumatic, I don’t have a single picture from that wedding.” Sharing about her another experience when she went for hair smoothening, but got her hair burnt, Parul says, “The hairdresser used such harsh chemicals that it burnt my hair. He told me that it happened because my hair was already coloured. He even asked me to come for another treatment after three months. And to compensate for it, he offered to give me a hair spa.” Kaustubh Sankhyadhar, a resident of East of Kailash, shares, “I was going for my first international trip three years ago, so I went for a haircut. I wanted a hairstyle like Virat Kohli with three lines on one side, so the hairdresser ended up using the trimmer, and there was no hair left on that side. So, while one side had hair and the other was bald. I had thought of cancelling the trip because it was awful. I told them that it was not about money, it was about my hair. I had to go fully bald after that.” Salon-goers tell us that a good rappot with the hairdresser in important to prevent bad haircutsNot just hair mishaps, there are wax burns, eyebrow cuts, too!Sharing her experience of eyebrow mishap, Radhika Bajaj, a resident of Subhash Nagar, says, “I had recently gone to my cousin’s place in South Extension, and we decided to go out for dinner that night. There was no need for me to get my eyebrows done, still I thought that it would look clean if I could get some extra growth removed. I went to a salon nearby, where the beautician ended up making a cut right in the middle of it. When I saw myself in the mirror and asked her, all she said was that she did not realise that it would look that bad. She thought she was only removing the extras, but in reality, she ended up leaving a cut. I had to wait for weeks for that cut to get better. Now I don’t let anyone touch my eyebrows, except one expert who has been doing it for years now.” Ragini Bansal, a resident of Saket, adds, “I only trust salons with experienced staff. I remember about six years ago, I had gone to a salon and they told me that a new staff member would do my waxing. It was all fine till she waxed my arms. When she started waxing my left leg, she ended up burning it with hot wax. She wanted to spread it but she took it more than what was needed, and before she could do anything about it, it was all over me. There was a burn on my leg, which stayed for almost three weeks. I have stopped waxing my legs since then and have switched to shaving after that incident.” Salon-goers tell us that your rapport with your beautician or grooming expert is very important to avoid mishaps like wax burns ‘Asked for hair trimming, was left with no hair to even tie my hair in a ponytail’If you think going to a popular salon might save you from mishaps, you are mistaken. Devika Gupta, a resident of Patel Nagar, doesn’t let anyone touch her hair except her hairstylist. She says, “If he is not on duty when I want a trim or haircut, then I don’t get the services done on the same day.” Shibani Chand Sethi, a resident of Sector 65, Gurgaon, who also takes up modelling assignments part-time, adds that she was facing hair fall after suffering from COVID, so she only wanted to get her edges trimmed, but the hairdresser ended up giving her an uneven haircut instead. “I had mid-length hair and because of the hair fall, I only wanted to get the edges trimmed, but the hairstylist shortened it till my ear, and that too, unevenly. He messed it up totally. I walked out being disappointed, but I did not say anything to him. I read a poster that read, ‘Women are emotional about their hair but we react when something shocking and unexpected like this happens to us,’” she says. Shivani Kumar, a resident of Sector 6, Dwarka, who went to a popular salon to get her split ends fixed, shares, “I had told the hairdresser specifically that I only wanted to get my hair trimmed, but after he was done, I noticed that I had no hair left to even tie my hair properly in a ponytail. When I asked him about my length, he said, ‘Ma’am, aap ke saare baal damaged thay.”’ Read AlsoAs Delhi's air turns toxic, doctors say N95 better than cloth masks to combat pollution + COVIDDelhi’s air quality severely dipped post Diwali, with many areas in the city recording an Air Quality Index (AQI) over 500.

---||India||Covid-19: Policy on booster shot soon, says panel member||HYDERABAD: India will soon release a policy document on administering a booster dose (third dose) of Covid-19 vaccine, a key member of the country’s Covid task force said on Thursday. Dr NK Arora, co-chair of INSACOG, a 28-lab consortium set up to monitor genomic variations in SARS-CoV-2, urged people not to take a booster dose right now as it won’t be considered for any certification. “We have been working on the policy document for the past three weeks, and firming it up. It will be made public soon,” Arora said. At the TimesNow Summit in Delhi, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said that it is natural to discuss the need for booster shots but the government would take a decision based on expert opinion. “Our objective is to first administer both the first dose and second dose to the entire eligible population. I do not think that in such matters (booster dose), the government will take any direct decisions... we will depend on whatever recommendations are given by ICMR and expert teams. We will deliberate the issue only after expert suggestions are received,” Mandaviya said. He added that the country has adequate doses available and, therefore, any future requirement can be met. The document, which is likely to be out in another 10 days, will spell out the government’s plans on rolling out a third dose and those eligible to get it first. “We are manufacturing 30-35 crore doses every month. We don’t have any shortage of vaccines, but that doesn’t mean you administer them without reason. There is a lot of scientific thought going into the document,” Arora said. Warning people not to go in for a third dose as yet, he said all seropositive studies across the country have shown vaccines administered so far have worked well, and there are no major outbreaks that should prompt panic and a rush for a secret vaccination. “There will be no record of this third dose that people take secretly,” Arora told TOI.

Its efficacy data alsoArora’s comment comes at a time when various officials, including Telangana health authorities, have openly advocated a third dose, saying people low on immunity should take a booster shot. “There is no such arrangement in CoWin. And you will not get a certificate. Moreover, there is no outbreak, and there are no major concerns as cases are coming down. We are in a better situation than many other countries,” Arora said.

The number of people overdue for the second dose has risen as Dr V KSo far, seropositive studies across India have shown that the vaccination drive has had a positive impact, with at least 85% of India’s eligible beneficiaries receiving at least one dose. “In Delhi, 97% of the population is seropositive. In UP, the figure is 88% and in Telangana 85%. The vaccination drive is in full swing,” Arora said, adding that the vaccine tracker shows that even those who have got only the first dose are protected from death. He said India’s plan to bridge the gap between two doses of Covishield has gone a long way in ensuring protection. “We are now reaping the benefits. Antibody levels among Indians are higher than (in) others,” he said. After Dussehra, barring some cases in West Bengal, Assam and Himachal Pradesh, there has been no cause for concern. “Dussehra is celebrated everywhere. But look, we don’t have major worries so far,” he added.

Its efficacy data also demonstrates 70.8% protection against all variants of SARS-CoV-2. Covaxin’s efficacy was arrived at through the evaluation of 130 confirmed cases, of which 24 were observed in the vaccine group and 106 cases were in the placebo group. The two-dose inactivated virus vaccine was developed from scratch in India by Bharat Biotech along with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Institute of Virology (NIV) Pune. The efficacy analysis showed Covaxin (BBV152) is 93.4% effective against severe symptomatic Covid-19 and offers 63.6% protection against asymptomatic Covid-19. It is also 65.2% effective against the Delta variant, 90.1% effective against the Kappa variant, Lancet said. “BBV152 was well tolerated; the same proportion of participants reported adverse events in the vaccine group [1597 out of 12879 (12.4%)] and placebo group [1597 of 12874 (12.4%)] with no clinically significant differences in the distributions of solicited, unsolicited, or serious adverse events between the groups, and no cases of anaphylaxis or vaccine-related deaths,” the peer-reviewed journal observed. Covaxin safety analysis demonstrates that the adverse events reported were similar to placebo, with 12% of the subjects experiencing commonly known side effects and less than 0.5% of subjects experiencing serious adverse events, Bharat Biotech said, adding: “Covaxin was well tolerated and the Data Safety Monitoring Board has not reported any safety concerns related to the vaccine. The overall rate of adverse events observed in Covaxin was lower than that seen in Covid-19 vaccines. The safety profile of Covaxin is now well established”. In a separate comment in The Lancet, Chinese experts Jing-Xin Li and Feng-Cai Zhu of the Nanjing-based Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention pointed out that with the Delta variant outcompeting all SARS-CoV-2 variants as the most predominant variant of concern globally, with substantially higher transmissibility than other VOCs, the BBV152 Phase 3 results reported by Raches Ella and colleagues were a “welcome advance”. “…in a phase 3 trial of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BBV152) based on an Asp614Gly variant, the authors found a substantial reduction in symptomatic Covid-19... In the study by Ella and colleagues, in all the delta-positive cases, the viral load in vaccine recipients was significantly lower than in placebo recipients,” they said while pointing to the reduced vaccine effectiveness being reported in real-world studies of other vaccines like the ones developed by Pfizer and AstraZeneca. Though Li & Zhu observed that the BBV152 study cohort was less ethnically diverse as only Indian participants were involved, they said: “the study provides evidence of protection against asymptomatic infection that might be of public health significance, which has not been reported in previous trials of other SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.” “Generally, the apparent protection against severe Covid-19 is most crucial, but the capability of preventing asymptomatic infection would also protect against mild disease, transmission, and eventually might lead to a reduction in subsequent cases of severe Covid-19,” the Chinese experts said. Zhu and Li also said that the roll-out of the vaccine might ease the ultra-cold chain requirements of other SARS-CoV-2 vaccine platforms, increase the finite global manufacturing capacity, and improve the insufficient supply of vaccines which disproportionately affects low-income and middle-income countries. Meanwhile, Bharat Biotech said Lancet peer-review confirms the efficacy analysis that demonstrates Covaxin to be effective against Covid-19 and that Covaxin is the only Covid-19 vaccine to have demonstrated efficacy data from phase III clinical trials against the Delta variant at 65.2%. “The peer-review of Covaxin phase III clinical trial data in The Lancet, an authoritative voice in global medicine, validates our commitment to data transparency and meeting the stringent peer-review standards of world-leading medical journals,” said Bharat Biotech chairman & managing director Dr Krishna Ella. He said with this, data from Covaxin’s product development and clinical trials have been published in 10 peer-reviewed journals, making Covaxin one of the most highly published Covid-19 vaccines in the world. Terming the partnership between Bharat Biotech, ICMR and NIV as one of the most successful public-private partnerships, ICMR director-general Dr Balram Bhargava said the publication of the efficacy data in Lancet speaks highly about the strong position of Covaxin among the global front-runner Covid-19 vaccines. “The bench to bedside journey of Covaxin in less than 10 months showcases the immense strength of `Atmanirbhar Bharat’ along with the Indian academia and industry in fighting against the odds and carving a niche in the global community,” Bhargava said. The Phase III efficacy and safety study involved around 25,800 volunteers across 25 sites in India. So far, over 150 million doses of Covaxin have been manufactured and supplied and it is now being evaluated in controlled clinical trials in children aged 2-18 years. The company has submitted data of the children's trials to the Indian drug regulator and its partner Ocugen has applied to the US Food & Drug Administration (USFDA) for emergency use authorisation for paediatric use of Covaxin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covaxin-well-tolerated-phase-3-data-shows-77-8-efficacy-against-symptomatic-covid-lancet/articleshow/87655618.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

The Chinese are building these villages possibly for billeting and locating their civilians and soldiers in the future, particularly after the recent face-offs we have had,” he said. “But this present controversy that has erupted that Chinese have come across into our territory and built a new village is not true,” he added, speaking at the Times Now summit here. China is building border infrastructure and these so-called villages "well within their side" of the LAC. “They have not transgressed anywhere on our perception of the LAC. There are different perceptions. We are very clear where the LAC lines…The Chinese have a perception, which in some areas we know and in other areas we don’t. As far as we are concerned, there is no such village development that has taken place on our side of the LAC,” said Gen Rawat. As earlier reported by TOI, China has built the new large 100-home village on disputed territory in the Upper Subansiri district of Arunachal Pradesh in violation of bilateral agreements. While the area is claimed by India, it has been under China’s “adverse occupation” since 1959.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/china-villages-are-on-their-side-chief-of-defence-staff-general-bipin-rawat/articleshow/87655806.cms||---

Responding to questions about reports of construction of Chinese “dual-use” villages in the border areas, particularly in Arunachal Pradesh, MEA spokesperson, Arindam Bagchi told journalists on Thursday that India has “conveyed its strong protest to such activities through diplomatic means and will continue to do so in the future.” China, he said, has “undertaken construction activities in the past several years along the border areas, including in the areas that it has illegally occupied over the decades.

The Indian defence establishment has been trying to downplay the issue. In background responses to journalists, defence officials have said these villages have been under Chinese control since 1959. “The village has been built by China in an area that was occupied by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) after overrunning an Assam Rifles post in 1959, in an operation known as Longju incident along the frontier in Arunachal Pradesh,” they were quoted as saying.

The number of people overdue for the second dose has risen as Dr V K Paul, member health in Niti Aayog and a key expert in the vaccination programme, had on October 20 said that the number of persons who had overshot the date for the second dose stood at 10 crore. Read AlsoCovid-19: Policy on booster shot soon, says panel memberDr NK Arora, co-chair of INSACOG, a 28-lab consortium set up to monitor genomic variations in SARS-CoV-2, urged people not to take a booster dose right now as it won’t be considered for any certification. “We have been working on the policy document for the past three weeks, and firming it up. ItIn a meeting with state health ministers to push the door-to-door vaccination campaign, the Centre suggested several measures such as creation of multiple vaccination teams (50-100) to ensure 100% coverage in the targeted area in a time-bound manner; development of a ranking mechanism for identifying and felicitating the vaccination teams (district and block) which administer the maximum number of vaccine doses every 24 hours, and utilising local weekly bazaars and haats for spreading awareness. “Let us ensure collectively through collaborative and multi-stakeholder efforts that no eligible citizen is left without the vaccine’s ‘Suraksha Kawachh’. Let us reach each corner and household and motivate people to take both the doses,” Mandaviya said while interacting with health ministers of states and UTs.

Spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid also assured that as per the “policy of Islamic Emirates of Afghanistan”, its land will not be used against any country and that Taliban want mutual cooperation. “Though we are not present in this conference, we firmly believe that this conference is in the better interest of Afghanistan as the entire region is considerate of the current Afghan situation and the participating countries also must be thoughtful of improving and safeguarding the security situation in Afghanistan and helping the current government to ensure security in the country on its own,” said Mujahid, adding Taliban didn’t have any anxiety about India’s conference. He expressed hope the outcome will be “utilised and implemented”. A day after the conference, the Indian government said while it is committed to providing humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan, the situation on the ground remained difficult because of a lack of unimpeded access for aid to the country. India is still awaiting Pakistan's approval for transporting wheat to Afghanistan by road. “India’s support to the people of Afghanistan is very clear. We have been extending support over many years to all the people of Afghanistan. The situation on the ground has become very difficult over the last few months,” said MEA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/want-good-diplomatic-ties-with-india-taliban/articleshow/87655835.cms||---
---||India||Four years after crib deaths, UP sacks Kafeel for ‘laxity’||LUCKNOW: Suspended twice and arrested as many times on different charges, UP paediatrician Dr Kafeel Khan was dismissed from government service late Wednesday in the 2017 oxygen shortage case involving 63 infant deaths at Gorakhpur’s BRD Medical College and Hospital. “He (Dr Kafeel) has been dismissed after a probe found him guilty of laxity leading to the death of children in that hospital. Since the matter is sub judice, the detailed information about his dismissal will be given to the court,” principal secretary of medical education Alok Kumar said. Responding to the move on social media, Khan said he would challenge the order in the court once he received it. “Sixty-three kids died because the government did not pay Rs 68 lakh to the oxygen-supplying firm. Eight people were suspended in this case, seven of whom have been reinstated. I got a clean chit from inquiries conducted by different officials — from the DM to the principal secretary...Even the HC held that there was not a single piece of evidence against me to establish negligence or corruption. Still, I have been terminated.” Khan had been suspended over the crib deaths along with seven others on August 22, 2017. He was subsequently jailed for nine months on charges of medical negligence, corruption and dereliction of duty. While under suspension, Khan was attached to the office of the director general of medical education, but trouble continued to stalk him. On July 31, 2019, the government suspended the paediatrician again for allegedly treating patients forcibly at a hospital in Bahraich district the previous year. The doctor, who had by then moved the Allahabad HC against his first suspension, challenged this order, too, arguing that since he was already under suspension in the BRD case, there was no point in issuing a similar order. The HC stayed the government’s order to suspend Khan for the second time this September. An inquiry committee had absolved Khan of the charge of medical negligence leading to the 2017 crib deaths. Although the main charge was dismissed, the probe report held Khan guilty of private practice till August 2016. A disciplinary panel partially accepted the findings, but contested the probe report in respect of two charges against Khan. On February 24 last year, the panel asked for further inquiry into the case. Khan challenged this order, too, in the high court. In its order on July 29 this year, the court said, “The delay in taking further action on the part of the disciplinary authority is not explained. The respondents are also obliged to justify the continuance of the order of suspension which has continued for more than four years.” On August 6, the state government submitted in court that it was withdrawing the additional inquiry against Khan. Additional advocate general Manish Goyal also said “all endeavour would be made to conclude the disciplinary proceedings against Dr Kafeel Khan within a period of three months”. The medical education department issued the termination order just after the completion of the three-month period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/four-years-after-crib-deaths-up-sacks-kafeel-for-laxity/articleshow/87655986.cms||---

Telecom and IT minister Ashwani Vaishnaw said that while the auctions may be delayed by a few months against the originally-envisaged targets, the plan is to roll out an attractive policy that will see companies ride over the recent reform package and plan new investments after the spectrum sale. Speaking at the Times Now Summit 2021, the minister said that regulator Trai is undertaking consultations with regards to the upcoming auctions, including for 5G airwaves. “I think they will submit their report by February-mid, is what we are thinking, may be February-end, maximum to maximum March. Immediately after that, we will have the auctions.” On final timelines of the auctions, he said, “Today, our estimate is by April-May. I was earlier estimating March. But, I think it will take time… because consultations are complex, diverse opinions are coming.” The government feels that the bailout package given in March will enable companies to have greater cash in hand that will not only help them invest higher in networks, but also plan liberally for the auctions. The government relief package had included removal of non-telecom revenues from the AGR definition, increasing tenure of spectrum holdings from 20 years to 30 years, no spectrum usage charges for new auctions, 100% FDI through the automatic route.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/government-plans-5g-sale-in-early-next-fiscal/articleshow/87656031.cms||Pankaj Doval
---||India||India, 21 other nations protest against ‘carbon colonisation’||GLASGOW: With COP26 heading for final day without taking definite call on key issues including climate finance and market-based mechanism for carbon reduction (carbon market), a climate negotiation group of 22 countries including India and China - known as Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) - on Thursday called the Conference presidency not to adopt "mitigation centric approach" by keeping 1.5 degree Celsius goal alive as a "collective responsibility" of all nations in the Glasgow decision text, and requested him to "completely remove paragraph on mitigation" in the revised text. The paragraph on mitigation in the text, which is to be finalised only after consensus, includes language on collectively trying to limit global warming to 1.5 degree C above pre-industrial level (1850-1900), as opposed to the target under the Paris Agreement which put 2 degree C as upper limit while keeping 1.5 degree C as merely an aspirational goal. The text also asked for commitments from 196 countries to boost their climate targets by 2023 to keep the warming limit goal of 1.5 degree Celsius alive and to submit by next year their long term decarbonisation strategies to be on a promised net-zero trajectory. The LMDC group including India, China, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bolivia and Indonesia, however, strongly objected to it and termed the move as 'carbon colonialism'. "Developed countries are pushing this narrative of 1.5 degrees Celsius very hard. We know that this narrative will lead them to control the world once again. And those countries that are not able to achieve the net zero targets by 2050, they will be ethically and financially condemned. That is unfair. That is against climate justice," said Diego Pacheco, Bolivia's lead negotiator, who represents the LMDC group. Speaking on behalf of the group at a press conference, he said, "We request developed countries to achieve real reduction of emissions immediately and by 2030, within this decade. They cannot take targets very distant in the future...We as LMDC do not accept that this COP will be a scenario for transferring historical responsibility to the developing countries". The LMDC members also expressed the need for higher mobilisation of finance from the developed countries instead of trying to change the narrative towards mitigation and 2050 'net zero' goal which, the group thinks, is against the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibility (CBDR) and respective capabilities (RC) as enshrined in the UN Convention and the Paris Agreement. "We are not going to accept any changes in the principle of CBDR. There should be differentiation. There should be recognition for CBDR in the negotiation process. And there should also be recognition of the pre-2020 ambition gap. So, if we are going to accept net zero by 2050 for all countries then the developing countries would be trapped in a very unjust way of addressing climate change," said Pacheco. The group noted that if it accepts the text on mitigation in the current form, the developing countries will be trapped in that narrative because they will never be able to achieve the targets that the Presidency is setting for the entire world as the Glasgow decision. "We need to fight the developed world against this carbon colonialism. It is very risky for our countries and completely ignores that there are historical responsibilities," said the Bolivian negotiator. The LMDC, meanwhile, appreciated the US and China deal even if it may add a new dynamic into the talks, raising questions over China's role in the BASIC and LMDC alliances as many believe that Beijing extracted nothing for developing nations from the US unlike India which has consistently been raising the issue of climate finance for the entire developing world. Appreciating the US-China deal, Pacheco said the LMDC welcomed all the arrangements in order to improve national efforts to increase ambition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-21-other-nations-protest-against-carbon-colonisation/articleshow/87655949.cms||Vishwa Mohan

Speaking at the Times Now Summit 2021, he said that the government will provide infrastructure, manpower, laboratory facilities, and information needed by the committee to complete its probe. On social media regulations, the minister said that while internet giants have given people a chance to express themselves freely, at the same time, misuse of technology has placed “a huge burden of thinking” on where should the regulation be. The minister said that there has to a balance between privacy and social responsibility. “I would say, our policy will have to have our cultural roots, our needs, our realities in focus when we do the policy,” he said, adding that the element of “trust” has to come in social media. The government’s approach is not to censor but to enable self-regulation while empowering users of social media. “There has to be first, an element of self-regulation. Self-regulation is the first step, second is the users themselves come out and regulate. The third is the government should step in. So, the way we have structured our social media and intermediary rules, basically puts the consumer in the front,” he said. On the issue of alleged use of Israeli spyware Pegasus for targeted surveillance in India, Vaishnaw said the government “fully respects” the Supreme Court’s direction. The committee formed by the Supreme Court has “stellar technical experts”, he said, adding that the government will provide complete cooperation to this committee in terms of infrastructure, manpower, laboratory facilities, and in terms of information that is needed. “We are absolutely clean on this, so we don’t have to worry about what is going to come out of this report,” he said. To a question on whether no government agency ever bought Pegasus, Vaishnaw said, “I had very categorically said in Parliament that whatever we are doing, is exactly within the framework of the law. And the law of the land has been clearly laid down by SC guidelines. Absolutely, we are within those four walls of the law.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/were-absolutely-clean-on-pegasus-will-cooperate-with-sc-panel-it-and-communications-minister-ashwini-vaishnaw/articleshow/87656133.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: No end to slugfest over bitcoin scam||BENGALURU: The BJP and Congress continued to point fingers at each other in the bitcoin scam. Soon after chief minister Basavaraj Bommai met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi on Thursday, state Congress president DK Shivakumar wondered why Bommai wanted to brief the PM about it. Instead, he said, the chief minister should place before people all case facts including the money trail and whether there had been money laundering. He said the chief minister was trying to ruin the image of Congress leaders by making accusations. Shivakumar accused the CM and BJP leaders of trying to mislead people “We won’t allow them to succeed. We have certain information and will disclose it at an appropriate time,” he said. Former CM HD Kumaraswamy alleged that thousands of crores of rupees were withdrawn from Jan Dhan accounts by hackers which is why the PMO seems to have taken the bitcoin scam seriously. He also wanted to know how Srikrishna Ramesh alias Sriki, a hacker and alleged kingpin of the scam, got bail so easily and asked who had provided him surety. Sriki was arrested in a drug case. Home minister Araga Jnanendra asked Congress leaders to provide information and evidence to investigating authorities instead of indulging in “hit-and-run allegations”. Countering Congress MLA Priyank Kharge who had alleged that the scam would cost Bommai his job, Mysuru BJP MP Pratap Simha said the scam would engulf Congress leaders. “Investigation will prove who is involved. Already names of kith and kin of Congress leaders have surfaced and that’s why they’re attacking the BJP,” he said. The chief minister's office described the PM's response in the Thursday meeting as tacit endorsement of Bommai's leadership and the party’s backing. Bommai had earlier said he didn’t offer any explanation to home minister Amit Shah but discussed it with party national president JP Nadda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/no-end-to-slugfest-over-bitcoin-scam/articleshow/87656158.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||HC: Customer’s benefit can’t outweigh public trust in banks||Bengaluru: A customer’s individual benefit under the Credit Guarantee Scheme cannot outweigh the trust people have in banks and any argument to the contrary may imperil the interest of other valuable customers and is not desirable, the high court observed. It rejected a petition filed by Traegen Systems Private Limited, a Bengaluru-based MSME in the business of musical instruments, audio equipment and allied things.The petitioner had challenged the October 1, 2020 communication issued by South Indian Bank Limited, refusing its request for financial assistance under the Credit Guarantee Scheme for subordinate debt.Declining to interfere in the matter, Justice Krishna S Dixit pointed out though good bankers will not dodge their responsibility to lend to creditworthy regular customers, whether large or small, at the same time, banking needs to be run with great caution.“While adventure to a certain extent may be necessary for other kinds of business like industry and commerce, reckless speculation and greedy eyeing of profits by compromising safety of public funds are shunned by prudent bankers all over the world,” the judge said.“There is a kind of dynamic tension between the forces impelling the progressive activities of banks and the compelling need for prudent conduct of banking business. In considering the petitioner’s claim of the kind, the respondent-bank cannot be asked to keep its commercial prudence in cold storage; it is more so when the balance sheet of the borrower does not reflect a healthy picture,” the judge added. Recalling the slogan, “Husband your banking resources”, that American economist Robert C Holland had given to bankers, the judge said it becomes relevant nowadays when about two dozen public sector banks have been closed down or merged with other banks due to unscrupulous lending and other reasons.“A little less than a century ago, Bombay Provincial Banking Enquiry Committee (1929-30) had famously observed, ‘Banking is my brains and other people’s money’,” Justice Dixit noted. It has been pointed out in the order that the petitioner-company (sanction letters dated December 11, 2014 and October 7, 2016) had availed term loans of Rs 5 lakh and Rs 30 kakh, respectively; subsequently, it had taken a cash credit open loan of Rs 2 crore (sanction letter dated September 07, 2017.)In addition, the two guarantors who are co-petitioners, also availed a mortgage loan of Rs 97 lakh (sanction letter dated March 26, 2019) and the bank on January 31, 2020 classified all loan accounts as NPA and initiated proceedings for recovery of Rs 2.5 crore as on September 2, 2020. However, Justice Dixit said this judgment will not come in the way of the bank reconsidering its decision if the petitioners come forward with a viable proposal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-customers-benefit-cant-outweigh-public-trust-in-banks/articleshow/87656161.cms||Vasantha Kumar

Things came to a head on November 6 when six two-wheelers parked near Jain College area were loaded on to a towing truck in a jiffy in Jayanagar 9th Block. There was no board on the wide road announcing that it was a no-parking zone. The residents said the SoP stipulated that towing staff must turn on a siren before towing any vehicle in a signal to the owner. If there is no response, they can tow the vehicle and if the owner turns up, police can collect only the violation fee prescribed for parking the vehicle at the no-parking area. “How can women and senior citizens run behind these cops? If the rules are violated by us, late them take action. Why unnecessary trouble us?” said Lakshmi K, a resident of Jayanagar. Soon, a crowd gathered against the unauthorised towing. The assistant sub-inspector (ASI) of jurisdictional Mico Layout traffic police rushed to spot, faced a volley of questions from the angry residents, apologised and released the vehicles. A video of the residents arguing with police went viral on Tuesday. “Recently, home minister Araga Jnanendra too directed traffic police to strictly adhere to towing rules while lifting vehicles from no-parking areas in the city, giving no room for any complaint of harassment from the public. But what are these people doing?” said Subramanya, another resident. ‘Can’t take away vehicles in parking zones’“We have a proper SoP for towing vehicles and when it is violated, we will take necessary action against our officers. When a vehicle is in a parking zone, officers and towing staff cannot tow it,” said KM Shantaraju, DCP east (traffic).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/towing-of-vehicles-leaves-jayanagar-residents-fuming/articleshow/87656166.cms||---

Shivakumar recently assured Kambale that he would get him a government job if the latter arranges Rs 10 lakh. Kambale arranged the cash and came to Hoskote with his friend Mahesh on October 8, to give the money to Shivakumar. “I came to Hoskote and called Shivakumar. He asked me to meet his friend Mohan, who could take me to the office concerned. Mohan sent a car, which picked us up from near Hoskote government hospital, where I was told to wait. Two people wearing caps and wielding lathis and a walkie-talkie intercepted our car and boarded it. The driver told me they are policemen. Within a few minutes, the duo snatched my bag containing cash and dumped us near Devanagundi Cross before speeding away,” Kambale alleged. Hoskote police inspector SR Manjunath and his team launched a probe and traced Mohan and his gang members. Police arrested the six miscreants and recovered Rs 7 lakh, two cars, walkie-talkie, caps, lathis and six mobile phones from them. Efforts are on to nab main suspect Shivakumar. With these arrests, police also solved another cheating case registered in Sarjapur against the same gang on October 5. The gang lured Mysuru resident Naveen, a realtor, on the pretext of selling him land at a lower price in Sarjapur area. Naveen had visited Sarjapur to see the land when the gang robbed him of Rs 4 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/6-held-for-robbing-govt-job-aspirant-realtor/articleshow/87656172.cms||---

The short-term tenders were floated on October 29, 2021 and are estimated to be worth Rs 5.8 crore in total. There are 21 tenders in all, each for planting 2,500 to 3,500 saplings, covering the eight zones of BBMP. The technical bids will be opened on November 17 and financial on November 24. The tenders envisage planting mahogany, neem and Indian Beech (Honge) and some fruit trees. “These trees are not exotic and the cost of one sapling is in the range of Rs 3 to Rs 500 depending on its age and condition, at BBMP’s nurseries. The tender estimates are exorbitant,” Vijay Nishanth, a conservationist alleged. “They spend money on saplings but forget to maintain them. On many occasions, tree guards are stolen and the saplings die without proper manure and due to other reasons. This is unnecessary,” said Nishanth. Endorsing the conservationist’s view, a top forest department official said, “The tender price for the saplings is very high. If they are planting sandalwood, teak, rosewood or other expensive exotic plants, it is possible to incur such high costs but that is not the case here.” The official found the timing of the short-term tenders odd, pointing out that if the saplings are planted in December their survival chances are zero. “If the pits are dug in December and saplings planted, their chances of surviving the winter are very poor. If they are sowed towards the end of summer, their chances of surviving are very high as rain supports them,” the official explained. ‘Miscellaneous expenses’BBMP’s deputy conservator of forests (DCF), Govindaraju V, however, denied that the tenders are exorbitantly priced. “These tenders include maintenance of the saplings, watering them, constructing tree guards and other miscellaneous expenses,” he said, adding, however, that the saplings would be provided from the Palike’s nurseries. Sources privy to the developments in BBMP reveal that similar tenders floated earlier were scrapped due to paucity of funds. “These tenders were floated to favour certain contractors. Though that is the case with most BBMP tenders, the cost is just unacceptable,” they said. BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta said that contractors would be held responsible if the plantation drive fails.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/tenders-floated-for-62k-saplings-bbmp-ready-to-pay-930-for-each/articleshow/87656178.cms||Nithya Mandyam
---||India||Salman Khurshid’s comparison of Hindutva with jihadist Islam wrong, says Ghulam Nabi Azad||NEW DELHI: As BJP attacked Congress leader Salman Khurshid accusing him of comparing Hindutva with jihadi organisations, Congress veteran Ghulam Nabi Azad weighed in on the controversy by red-flagging colleague Khurshid for “factually wrong” comparison. Azad said, “We may not agree with Hindutva as a political ideology distinct from the composite culture of Hinduism, but comparing it with ISIS and jihadist Islam is factually wrong and exaggeration.” The alleged comparison is from the book by former law minister Khurshid “Sunrise over Ayodhya: Nationhood in our Times” which was released at a function on Wednesday. The book is about the Ayodhya judgement of the Supreme Court which Khurshid has lauded. Azad’s decision to distance himself from Khurshid is interesting given that both have been long-standing colleagues in the party as well as in the central governments. But it may also indicate the discomfort in certain ranks of the party given that such controversies feed the rival BJP’s campaign to paint Congress as “anti Hindu”. When asked about Azad’s statement, Khurshid said, “Azad is an experienced person. His statement is carefully noted.” He said there was not much difference between him and Azad in the stance they have taken. “He has also said that he disagrees with that ideology while I have explained why we disagree with it. That’s all,” Khurshid said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/salman-khurshids-comparison-of-hindutva-with-jihadist-islam-wrong-says-ghulam-nabi-azad/articleshow/87656179.cms||---

We do not want to rush in administering vaccines to children. Children are the future of our country. The government will take expert opinion and go by it,” Mandaviya said, underlining that other countries have also been careful in introducing the jabs for children even though emergency use authorisation has been granted. The minister’s remarks indicate that the decision on vaccination for children is not round the corner. Government has noted that the high prevalence of antibodies detected in adults in sero surveys conducted by the Centre and the states are also reflected in children who have not been vaccinated. This has encouraged officals to deliberate more on the decision on vaccinating children. Emphasising that India has adequate vaccines and has been forthcoming in supporting other countries with medical products and services, Mandaviya said India will be a major supplier of affordable Covid vaccines to the world in future. "We will provide vaccines to the world in future and that will be low-cost vaccine – not the one for $15-18 but for $3-4 – and people across the world will take it. We can help poor countries like that and this the Indian culture," Mandaviya said. A total of 31 crore doses of Covid-vaccines will be supplied in November and companies have been constantly increasing manufacturing capacity. More companies are going to start vaccine manufacturing in India and production will increase further in coming months to meet requirement worldwide, he added. At present, the government is focused on maximising coverage of first and second doses of vaccines. While 16 crore unutilised doses of Covid vaccine are available with states and UTs, 79% of eligible population has been covered with the first dose, whereas 38% have received both. Over 12 crore people are due for their second dose. While the Centre remains confident of meeting the December deadline for full coverage of the adult population, Mandaviya said it is pushing states to ensure the results at the earliest. The health minister also said that the government has used the opportunity to ramp up health infrastructure and facility across the country so that it is prepared to efficiently tackle any such future pandemic or health emergency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jabs-for-kids-centre-to-be-cautious-says-health-minister-mansukh-mandaviya/articleshow/87656115.cms||---

DCP (traffic-west) Kuldeep Kumar Jain said P Mativannan, a resident of Tiruppur in TN, was arrested by traffic police for mowing down a 25-year-old private company employee in October 2005. Mativannan worked with a travel agency in Tiruppur. “Mativannan drove to the city in his owner’s SUV to drop some passengers. On his way back, he rammed a biker near Marenahalli junction in Vijayanagar, killing the rider on the spot. Mativannan was arrested and chargesheeted under IPC section 304A (causing death due to negligence). Accordingly, a local court convicted him and sentenced him to one-year simple imprisonment and slapped a fine of Rs 3,000. He went elusive soon after,” said Jain. In July this year, the matter came up during a review meeting and a police team led by inspector GY Giriraj visited Tiruppur. However, cops returned empty handed as Mativannan, 48, had shifted his residence. “The team contacted his previous owner, with whom Mativannan worked. The owner told us that Mativannan had quit long ago. After much effort, we managed to get his mobile number and, finally, traced him to a different place in Tiruppur and arrested him on Wednesday,” added Jain. Mativannan was produced before the court which had convicted him and was sent to judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/convict-on-the-run-for-14-yrs-arrested/articleshow/87656171.cms||---

While the maximum temperature in the city dipped to as low as 19.8 degrees Celsius, the minimum was 18. Things are likely to remain this way for the next two days until the clouds clear out. For the next two days, Bengaluru can expect a generally cloudy sky along with moderate to heavy rain and light to moderate rain for two days thereafter. According to the Met department, districts in south interior Karnataka, including Bengaluru, will receive moderate to heavy showers at isolated places over the next 24 hours, whereas rain/ thundershowers are very likely at isolated places over coastal Karnataka and a few places over north interior Karnataka. Heavy to very heavy rain is likely to occur at isolated places over Bengaluru Urban, Bengaluru Rural, Chikkaballapur, Kolar, Chitradurga and Tumakuru districts of south interior Karnataka during the next 24 hours for which a yellow alert has been issued. The day-long drizzle though reduced traffic to a near crawl in several parts of Bengaluru, including Hebbal flyover, early in the morning and evening due to poor visibility. Commuters had to keep their vehicle headlights on for clear view. A tree each was uprooted on the road from Silk Board towards Marathahalli, in Malleswaram and in Shankar Math ward.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/nippy-wet-weather-makes-blureans-nostalgic/articleshow/87656175.cms||---

The parishe was a low-key affair last year due to Covid-19 curbs. It was restricted to Bull Temple premises and no stalls were seen in and around Basavanagudi Main Road. “We are in celebration mood now. After two years we want the parishe to get back its glory. Kadalekai Parishe is a heritage festival of Namma Bengaluru. We want this tradition to continue and the younger generation should know about...,” said Basavanagudi MLA Ravi Subramanya. Though the actual event is on November 29, it will begin two days earlier as it is weekend. As many as 1,000 groundnut farmers are expected to set up shop this parishe, a 480-year-old tradition that has been kept alive. “After the outbreak of Covid-19 last year, Kadalekai Parishe was called off. As the number of cases has dropped this time, there is no need to impose any prohibition. However, our officials had a preliminary meeting with the organisers. We plan to hold the fair by following Covid protocols,” said BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta. The fair draws around six lakh people every year. “This year the same footfall is expected,” added Subramanya. Years ago many villages stood where Basavnagudi is now and groundnut was a major crop in the region. Legend has it that a bull arrived every full moon night and grazed on the crop. Farmers pledged their first crop to Nandi (Lord Shiva’s vehicle) to ward off bull raids on their crop. Later, in the16th century, the Bull Temple was built and farmers from surrounding villages started coming each year to the temple to offer their annual produce.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/after-covid-lull-kadlekai-parishe-to-make-a-grand-comeback-from-nov-27/articleshow/87656163.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Another grandson of HD Deve Gowda may take the plunge into electoral politics||BENGALURU: The December 10 polls to 25 legislative council seats from local bodies may see the political debut of another scion of former prime minister HD Deve Gowda as Suraj Revanna, former minister HD Revanna’s first son, is seeking a ticket from Hassan district. If Suraj, 34, gets the nod to contest the MLC elections, he will become the eighth member of the Gowda clan to enter electoral politics and the third grandson of the patriarch to face an election on a JD(S) ticket. His younger brother Prajwal Revanna, Lok Sabha member from Hassan, and cousin Nikhil Kumaraswamy unsuccessfully contested parliamentary polls from Mandya in 2019. Apart from Gowda, who is a Rajya Sabha member, six of his family members are into active politics. Former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy and his elder brother Revanna have been contesting elections for more than 25 years, while Kumaraswamy’s wife Anitha Kumaraswamy is an MLA and Revanna’s wife Bhavani Revanna was a member of Hassan zilla panchayat till June when its term expired. “The party will finalise the candidate from Hassan on Friday at the meeting of district leaders convened by Deve Gowda,” said JD(S) state president HK Kumaraswamy. “Certain names, including Suraj Revanna’s, have cropped up and the selection will be made by the brass based on merit and consultation.” While 25 seats are going to polls, JD(S) has a fair chance of winning one from Hassan district, which has two corporations (Hassan and Arsikere), four city municipal councils (Holenarasipura, Channarayapattana, Beluru and Sakleshpur), two town panchayats (Alur and Arkalgud) and 250 gram panchayats. The confidence stems from the fact that the party enjoys a majority in all local bodies barring Belur CMC where Congress is the single largest party. Although JD(S) seems to have a clear edge over its rivals, the party does not want to take a chance going by the experience of 2015 when Gopal Swamy from Congress handed a shocking defeat to its candidate Patel Shivaram. A section of JD(S) functionaries is batting for Suraj, while some are backing his mother Bhavani as the second choice. “People of Hassan are in favour of Bhavani and they want to see her as their MLC. Suraj is also favourable as a young face,” said KS Lingesh, Belur MLA and Hassan district president, JD(S). Suraj, a medical doctor, already took a plunge into active politics as he was elected director to Hassan district cooperative bank last year and is now aspiring to be an MLC. However, sources said it won’t be easy for him or his mother as internal politics within the family may come in the way. “No decision on fielding Suraj Revanna or any other candidate has been taken yet. There are six MLAs and many senior leaders in Hassan. The candidate will be finalised based on their suggestions,” said HD Kumaraswamy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/another-grandson-of-deve-gowda-may-take-the-plunge-into-electoral-politics/articleshow/87656159.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

Up against the third seed, the 14-year-old Rujula, who was seeded sixth in the age group, prevailed in a tough first game before claiming the title 22-20, 21-12 in 40 minutes.The first game was a seesaw affair which both players dominated in turns. The second witnessed a resurgent Neysa leading 9-7 at one point and looking set to level the scores. But Rujula, an eighth standard student of Sophia High School, upped her game by a few notches, yielded just three more points to her opponent before sealing the match.Rujula’s triumphant run began in the morning when she, as the top seed, made a clean sweep of the U-15 girls titles. First, she eased past Mounitha AS to the U-15 singles crown 21-12, 21-13 before combining with Meghashree GS to put it across Jade Anil and Diya Bheemaiah 21-19, 21-18.“Full credit to her coach Mohan sir of Patel’s Inn. Rujula has been training under him right from the beginning. Her biggest achievement came in 2019 when she won all the seven state ranking tournaments in the U-13 category. She lost one full year in the U-15 section because of Covid in 2020. This year, she won both the tournaments that she has played in,” her father Ramu said.About Rujula’s favourite actor Puneeth, Ramu added: “We would take a detour and pass by the actor’s home every day on our way to her practice sessions hoping that Rujula would get to see him. But it never happened. Rujula felt dedicating the titles was the best way to pay tribute to him.”Fifth seed Satvik Shankar emerged champion among U-17 boys, beating third seed Nicholas Nathan Raj 21-16, 21-17.

"Installs had dipped between Q3 2020 and Q2 2021 following the removal of PUBG Mobile in India. The last quarter PUBG Mobile was the top game globally was Q4 2018," the Sensor Tower Q3 report said.Last year, the Indian government banned 118 Chinese apps and games, including PUBG Mobile. But it returned to India in June this year with the release of Battlegrounds Mobile India, which helped it achieve more than 200% growth quarter-on-quarter in Asia. More than 36 million of PUBG Mobile’s 45 million Google Play installs in Asia came from its version for India. Prior to its removal from Google Play in India, PUBG Mobile’s best quarter in the country was nearly 41 million installs back in Q3 2019. India was by far the largest market in Asia on Google Play with 52% of installs in the region. India reached 7 billion downloads for the fourth time in the past five quarters. Four publishers based in India ranked among the top 20, including Reliance Jio, MX Media, and Mohalla Tech. Sensor Tower's estimates include downloads for iPhone, iPad, and Google Play.

MLC and BJP city president Pravin Datke said the BJP-led central government had reduced Rs 5.8 and Rs 12 on petrol and diesel, respectively, but the MVA government was not concerned about the citizens. Pravin said, “Why is the so-called ‘janata raja’ of Maharashtra Sharad Pawar quiet now, and not taking the lead to ask chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and his government to reduce the VAT on petrol and diesel?” BJP leader Sanjay Bhende said the central government in one stroke reduced the rates of petrol and diesel and since then, Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and Congress — the three main components of MVA government in Maharashtra — are having sleepless nights as they used to blame Centre for high rates of fuel but now it’s their turn to show that they really care for citizens by reducing VAT on these items in Maharashtra. He added, “Nawab Malik has time to come in front of the media daily but doesn’t have time to talk on fuel prices. Nor is he concerned about the statewide strike of state transport employees, that is effecting the citizens.” BJP Hingna MLA Sameer Meghe said apart from the high petrol and diesel prices, citizens’ electric lines are also being cut by the MSEDCL staff. “This has created great anger amongst the citizens against the MVA government,” Meghe added. Members of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, led by Shivani Dani, Yash Satpute and others, burnt an effigy of MVA government with posters of Uddhav Thackeray, Ajit Pawar and Balasaheb Thorat, at Variety Square during the protest. BJP leaders like party general secretary Chandrashekhar Bawankule, MLAs Krishna Khopde and Vikas Kumbhare, MLC Girish Vyas, BJP Nagpur rural president Arvind Gajbhiye, Sanjay Bangale and members of Bharatiya Janata Mahila Aghadi were also part of the protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-stages-protest-against-mva-govt-for-not-reducing-vat-on-fuel-prices/articleshow/87670857.cms||Ranjit Deshmukh

According to Chadha, BoB is repositioning itself on the basis of how the world has changed with respect to technology. “Even if you are a universal bank, if you do not have an aggressive and effective digital strategy you will be left behind. That, I think, is the biggest challenge.” He added that the bank would create competitive advantages by building up capabilities for digital sourcing and delivery of business.At the same time, the bank would continue to rationalise costs in other areas. “We are looking at some global operations, which are either subscale or don’t have too much growth potential to see whether we can close them down. While the international book will grow, the footprint would be lighter,” said Chadha. He added that the international finance centre at GIFT City would become an important part of the bank’s international book.The bank has exited South Africa, Hong Kong, Trinidad & Tobago and Guyana and is now looking at Malaysia. Last year, the bank rationalised nearly 1,300 of its domestic branches following the amalgamation of Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank with itself. This has resulted in the bank’s rental expenses coming down by 5%. On credit growth, Chadha said that he expects fresh investments in steel and cement by existing players. “Because these are brownfield investments, the growth would be fairly quick compared to greenfield projects. Also, as these are existing strong players, the quality of credit will be good,” said Chadha.While an increase in interest rates would lead to treasury gains tapering off, Chadha said that this would be compensated by interest income as credit picks up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bob-plans-to-list-life-arm-next-fiscal/articleshow/87655073.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Business||Credit inquiries surge 54% YoY across Feb-Oct||Mumbai: A TransUnion Cibil study has said that India’s retail credit market is poised for strong growth supported by a significant resurgence in credit demand as well as supply, despite the second wave of the pandemic. The findings are based on inquiry volumes with the bureau, which increased by 54% between February and October this year, as economic activity gained momentum. Meanwhile, outstanding balances and credit-active consumers grew by 8% and 7% respectively in August 2021 over the previous year. TransUnion’s forecast is based on its credit market indicator (CMI), which factors in credit inquiries, actual lending, consumer behaviour and delinquencies. The CMI is highest for public sector banks at 97, followed by private banks at 91 and NBFCs lagging at 88. Although NBFCS saw less of a recovery after the first wave of the pandemic due to higher delinquencies, they have also seen a sharp recovery in credit health. “Lenders have adapted quickly to the shift in new credit originations via digital channels, which has become the new normal in the pandemic environment. They’ve managed to do this whilst adapting strategies to ensure risk stays within acceptable limits,” explained TransUnion Cibil MD and CEO Rajesh Kumar. State-wise, the CMI has improved most for Maharashtra followed by Gujarat, Delhi and West Bengal. It has deteriorated most for Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. According to the report, inquiry volumes have increased by 20% between February and August 2021 compared to a decline of 31% during the same months last year. The increased demand is driven by consumption products (personal loans, credit cards and consumer durable loans). Inquiries for consumption products have increased by 29% between February and August this year compared to a decline of 42% during the same months last year. Credit demand has further improved with the onset of the festive season. Inquiry volumes have increased by 54% between February and October this year from a 12% decline during same period in the previous year. While balances have increased 12.4% in August this year over August 2020, lenders have turned cautious and approval rates have dropped by 4% during the same period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/credit-inquiries-surge-54-yoy-across-feb-oct/articleshow/87655012.cms||---

According to RBI data, with increased awareness, digital penetration and financial inclusion, the number of complaints against various regulated entities more than doubled from 1.6 lakh in FY18 to 3.3 lakh FY20. The integrated ombudsman scheme will be launched by the Prime Minister on Friday along with the scheme for retail participation in the primary auction of government securities. Under the retail G-Secs scheme, individual investors can access the online portal to open a securities account with the RBI, bid in primary auctions and buy & sell securities in the market. No fee will be charged for any of the services provided under the scheme. The integrated scheme allows customers to file their complaints from anywhere at any time through portal/email, or through physical mode at one point of receipt, without the need to identify any specific ombudsman or scheme. It will do away with the jurisdictional limitations as well as limited grounds for complaints. The RBI will provide a single reference point for the customers to submit documents, track the status of complaints filed and provide feedback. The complaints that are not covered under the ombudsman scheme will continue to be attended to by the regional offices of the RBI. The integrated ombudsman scheme is based on a review of internal grievance redressal of banks and other regulated entities. Following the review, the RBI decided to merge the ombudsman scheme for banking, NBFCs and digital transactions. These schemes were administered through 22 offices of the RBI ombudsman and complaints falling outside their purview are attended to by the consumer education and protection cells at the 30 regional offices of the central bank. Based on the review, the RBI decided to integrate the three ombudsman schemes into one, and also extend it to cover all complaints involving deficiency in service and centralise the receipt and initial processing of complaints to enhance process efficiency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/digital-doubled-banking-plaints-in-2-yrs-rbi-data/articleshow/87655187.cms||---

This enables the merchants to become part equity owners of the company. BharatPe will create an equity pool structure worth up to $100 million for the MSP to be allotted to eligible merchants over the course of the next four years. “The company is aiming that the MSP pool will be worth close to $1 billion by the time it goes public,” Bharat Pe said in a statement. It expects the programme to drive better merchant stickiness and enhance loyalty among merchant partners. “While we as a startup community celebrate the coming of age with multi-billion dollar IPOs, there is resentment brewing elsewhere. Millions of consumers and merchants are feeling left out of the digital/startup value-creation in India,” said BharatPe co-founder and MD Ashneer Grover. “This reiterates the company’s commitment to positively impact the lives of all its merchant partners who have played a key role in the adoption of digital payments and the growth of the company.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bharatpe-will-offer-100mn-equity-to-retain-merchants/articleshow/87654787.cms||Mayur Shetty

It took 35 days for Rafi Kollam to reach Jaipur. He will reach Delhi by November 13 and meet Youth Congress national president Srinivas BV. He will also attend a parliament march to protest against the fuel price hike on November 20 before leaving for Kerala. Rafi, who had worked in Dubai as a human resource manager earlier, said he started the journey on cycle to connect with people and understand their point of view regarding the Congress and its prospects. According to his interaction with people from various walks of life on his way, in some states it is the caste factor playing against the Congress, while in states like Gujarat and Maharashtra, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had been using the police and state agencies against the Congress leaders. He said they have been switching sides fearing harassment. He claimed that the Congress had a strong base everywhere it was important to channelise the support, especially from the youth, for the benefit of the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/kerala-man-cycles-to-city-protesting-fuel-price-hike-meets-pilot/articleshow/87655151.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Civic bodies up the heat on non-veg street food vendors||Vadodara/Rajkot: Though they have always been an eyesore in the state, Rajkot and Vadodara municipal corporations have of late issued directives to ensure that non-vegetarian street food carts stay ‘invisible’ to public eye. The first to crack the whip was the ruling BJP in Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) which orally ordered officers to remove street vendors selling non-vegetarian food and egg dishes from the main roads. A drive in this regard started in the city for the past two days, albeit there is no notification or official order issued to this effect. Officials, however, maintain that they are not specifically targeting non-veg food vendors but are taking action anywhere they receive a complaint of encroachment. Rajkot mayor Pradeep Dav himself started the drive after he got several complaints. Dav held meetings with some non-vegetarian food vendors before Diwali and instructed them to shift from the main roads. Dav told TOI, “I have asked officials to shift non-veg and egg ‘larris’ (carts) from major crossroads and those that park themselves near the temples. A majority of people feel disgusted while passing by these carts because of its smell and many also hang chicken outside.” Municipal commissioner Amit Arora said, “There is no specific instruction to remove non-veg carts. We remove all kinds of encroachment specifically where we get complaints of encroachment.” RMC has seized six carts selling non-veg food items in the past two days. There was a suggestion to develop a hawker zone specially for non-veg street vendors but for that RMC has found no suitable place. Like Rajkot, orders in Vadodara too are oral and no notification has been brought out so far. In Vadodara, chairman of the standing committee of Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC), Dr Hitendra Patel gave instructions in this regard to officials at a meeting on Wednesday evening. Patel, however, assured that the vendors will not be ousted. “We are asking the vendors to ensure that they do not hang or display non-vegetarian food. They will have to keep it covered,” said Patel. The chairman said that this was done to ensure that hygiene is maintained and sentiments are not hurt. At the other end, the state president of National Association of Street Vendors of India, Arvind Sindha, who is from Vadodara claimed that non-vegetarian food vendors had been asked to move away from main roads. “They have been told to move away from 30m and 18m roads,” he said. Refuting this allegation, Patel, however, said that the carts were only being asked to ensure they do not hamper traffic movement. “At times there is heavy rush at such places and leads to traffic problems,” he said. Meanwhile, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation standing committee chairman said, “We had in fact begun a campaign against non-veg food stalls selling without licences in front or near religious places. The campaign is still on and I will take a review of this shortly.” ‘Why not cover veg food too?’ VMC standing committee chairman Dr Hitendra Patel sighted maintaining hygiene as one of the reasons behind the instructions to cover non-vegetarian food. In response, state president of the National Association of Street Vendors of India, Arvind Sindha, said that the same rule should be made applicable to all street food vendors. “Even carts selling vegetarian items too should made to cover properly,” Sindha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/civic-bodies-up-the-heat-on-non-veg-street-food-vendors/articleshow/87654611.cms||---
---||Goa||Low pain threshold, parents’ demands spiking Goa’s caesarean rate: Doctors||PANAJI: At 39%, Goa’s caesarean delivery (c-section) rate, which has been much higher than the national rate of 17.5%, will need long-term, definitive and sustained measures to drop. Although the high prevalence of c-sections is blamed on late marriages and the consequent delay in motherhood, other factors have also contributed to the high rate of the medical intervention in the state. Experts say a low pain threshold among mothers-to-be, a growing desire of parents to have a child born on a certain day or at a fixed time (muhurat), seeking that a child is born before December 31 so that a year is not wasted and admission to a desired school is assured upon six years of age, and increased incidence in assisted pregnancies have all led to a drastic rise in c-sections in India’s tiniest state. Interestingly, the trend of c-sections has grown despite the risks involved being much higher than a vaginal delivery. Goa records 17,000-18,000 live births annually. “Various factors are responsible, but caesarean deliveries on demand have become popular. In several cases, a woman and her family insist on it because she does not want to endure labour pains. If a doctor declines, there’s a chance that she will go to another hospital,” senior obstetrician and gynaecologist Dr Govind Kamat said. He said that a woman who has delivered her first child through c-section, is likely to undergo the procedure for subsequent births. “A doctor, too, will likely opt for a caesarean delivery to avoid the risk of rupture of the scalp while performing a vaginal delivery of the second child,” Kamat said. Diet, a woman’s age of attaining motherhood, and her threshold for pain are among the important factors that will decide if she will able to have a normal delivery. Conversely, a lack of awareness and fear of pain could also push her to make the wrong choice. “Sometimes, it’s the parents who plead for a caesarean delivery as they can’t bear to see their daughter in pain and distress. Unlike their predecessors, women today are not accustomed to hard labour,” another senior obstetrician and gynaecologist Dr Ajit Mopkar said. “At times, even women who favour vaginal births will demand a c-section once they go into labour and will not take no for an answer. In such situations, doctors are left with no option but to oblige.” Obstetrician and gynaecologist Dr Deepti Pinto Rosario said that efforts have to be made to avoid a first c-section in every expectant mother. “Even if a woman has had a prior caesarean delivery, she can assess her chances of having a vaginal delivery the second time around,” she said. A woman who has had her first child though c-section will have around 30 to 50% chances of a vaginal delivery subsequently, senior obstetrician and gynaecologist at the GMC Dr Ajit Nagarsenkar said. He said that the option could be explored if the woman does not have other obstetric and medical conditions and could be a way to curtail the rising rates of c-sections in the state. “We need to be very strict about primary (first) c-section of every mother to be,” he said. While unreasonable demands by families during childbirth are not uncommon, Mopkar said he doesn’t give in to such diktats. “A delivery through c-section will not be conducted before schedule if there is no strong medical ground to do so,” he said. Doctors also see a significant section of women becoming mothers late and contributing to the trend of c-section. After failing to conceive naturally, their only hope of giving a birth is through in-vitro fertilisation (IVF), with increased chances of a c-section to avoid complications during childbirth. The GMC, too, receives such cases of women becoming pregnant during their 40s through IVF and approaching the institute for delivery. “Normally, 10% of total deliveries in any set-up have to be through c-section due to various complications. The caesarean method was introduced for a safe delivery when vaginal births became difficult, but otherwise, the emphasis has to be on delivery normal process,” Nagarsenkar said. Rosario said education and dispelling fears around childbirth will go a long way in preparing a woman and her family for labour. While Goa’s c-section rate is close to 40%, Nagarsenkar said that there’s still scope to reduce it by at least 10%. The GMC sees about 4,000 deliveries a year, with 35% being c-sections. “Our c-section rate is about 35% because 25 to 30% of the cases that we see are complicated and referred by other hospitals,” he said. “Considering all factors, there will have to be awareness that a vaginal delivery is a safe delivery. After all, childbirth is a physiological process, a normal procedure, that has to be allowed without much interference provided there are no indications of complications to the mother and child,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/low-pain-threshold-parents-demands-spiking-goas-caesarean-rate-doctors/articleshow/87655406.cms||Bindiya Chari

He said the next generation should know about the works of Azad, who was the first education minister of the country. The CM felicitated retired paediatrician from Jamui, Dr Shankar Nath Jha, with Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Award for his work in the field of education. Dr Jha has been working diligently to impart education to the deprived sections of the society, especially from the Musahar community. He was awarded with a citation, cash prize of Rs2.5 lakh and a shawl. Dr Jha, also a social activist, prevented 450 child marriages and helped in admission of 950 child labourers in schools. He also kept 850 children suffering from malnutrition under his care and helped them regain health and pursue education. Due to his efforts, many Musahar community kids are pursuing higher studies after graduation. Addressing the media after the programme, Nitish said the state has been organizing the education day since 2007. “Later, I wrote a letter to the central government to organize education day at the national level also. The Centre accepted my proposal and this day has been organized at the national level as well from November 11, 2008,” he said. The CM said the Covid-19 situation has been improving in the state due to continuous testing and vaccination. “We believe that we will soon win the fight against the Covid-19,” he said and congratulated everyone for the peaceful Chhath Puja celebration. Additional chief secretary (education) Sanjay Kumar said education to all is the state government’s top priority. “Around 20% of the state budget is being spent on education sector. We have high schools in every panchayat. Now, every sub-division will have degree colleges. We are also making efforts to start postgraduate colleges in every district. Of the 38 districts, 29 have postgraduate colleges,” he said. Education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary, health minister Mangal Pandey, building construction minister Ashok Choudhary, CM’s principal secretaries Deepak Kumar and Chanchal Kumar, chief secretary Tripurari Sharan, development commissioner Amir Subhani, CM’s secretary Anupam Kumar, Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh and other dignitaries were present during the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-schoolchildren-to-learn-about-maulana-azads-works/articleshow/87652934.cms||Faryal Rumi

In a survey conducted in Bihar, nearly 10 lakh people were found to have refused jabs. At a meeting with state health ministers, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Thursday instructed them to strengthen the ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ campaign and ensure that every eligible beneficiary takes both the doses of Covid-19 vaccines. As per the state health department’s data, there are 7.43 crore beneficiaries in Bihar and 69.4% of them had taken the first dose and 39.4% both the doses till November 10. State Health Society additional executive director Animesh Kumar Parashar said they were already carrying out ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ campaign and 8200 mobile bikes were used in a special drive on November 7 to vaccinate the beneficiaries. Parashar said apart from the 10 lakh those who refused, nearly 30 lakh eligible beneficiaries were found pregnant women and many of them were also hesitant in taking vaccines. “We will focus on vaccinating pregnant women on November 13, as they will be coming to the health centres for antenatal check-up as a part of Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyaan. Healthcare workers will counsel such women and ensure that they take their doses,” said Parashar. He further said that the department was roping in various development partners like WHO and UNICEF to push such beneficiaries to take the vaccines. An official in the health department said several such beneficiaries were residing in one hamlet. “Few people also avoided vaccination because of the festivals. Now we expect them to take their shots,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/stress-on-giving-1st-jab-to-all-by-nov-30/articleshow/87652546.cms||Sheezan Nezami

---||Patna||Bihar: Sudha milk, dairy products become dearer||PATNA: The Bihar State Milk Cooperative Federation Limited (Comfed) has increased the prices of all varieties of milk and other dairy products by Rs2 to Rs4/litre under its brand Sudha from Thursday, inviting sharp criticism from the residents, who are already hard-pressed due to rising prices of other essential commodities. The Comfed officials attributed it to rise in fuel and fodder prices, input and operational cost. They said the rate of milk procurement from livestock owners has also been increased by Rs2.32/litre. Sudha Cow milk cost has been increased from Rs43 to Rs46/litre and of Sudha toned milk from Rs41 to Rs43/litre. Sudha double-toned milk has been priced at Rs40/litre, Sudha standard milk at Rs49/litre, tea special at Rs43 and full cream milk at Rs56/litre. The rates of paneer, milk cake, gulab jamun and balushashi have also been increased by Rs4. Nitin Choudhary of Ashiana Nagar said it was unfair to increase the milk prices. “We are already burdened with the rise in prices of household essentials,” he said. “The prices of milk products had been increased in February this year and again they have revised the rates. The household budget is already in a mess due to rise in fuel prices, foodgrains, vegetables and fruits. How will we increase our immunity, if we constantly cut the household budget,” said Dipti Sinha of Gardanibagh. Shanti Devi from Bhattacharyya Road area said all essential items of daily use have become costlier. “The government should think about common people,” she said. The state bakery association has recently increased the prices of different types of bread by Rs2 to Rs5 per packet. Sandwich bread of 175gm is now available at Rs15 per packet. Prices of multigrain and brown bread has increased from Rs35 to Rs40 per packet. Pav is now being sold at Rs22 and fruit bread at Rs20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sudha-milk-dairy-products-become-dearer/articleshow/87652512.cms||---
---||Mumbai||This is how you protect women? City police have no discipline: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Hearing a torture plea from an intercaste couple on Thursday, an HC bench noted that the senior inspector and the investigating officer (IO) were not in court. Prosecutor Shahaji Shinde said the IO is busy with Chhath puja bandobast. “This is how we are protecting our ladies (sic) in our city from goons who come from Gujarat and beat them and rape them. There is a serious complaint from a city girl,’’ said Justice S J Kathawalla. Peeved, they asked the police chief to appear through video-conferencing or remain present. Police chief Hemat Nagrale said a zero FIR would be filed and sent to Gujarat police for investigation. But advocate Pranav Badheka, appearing for the couple, objected, saying the conspiracy started in Mumbai. “She is a Maharashtra girl. She was abducted from here. Mumbai police should investigate it,’’ he added. The judges asked DCP (zone X) to “look into it”. “We’ll inquire into the lapses,” Nagrale told the judges, who said there is “no discipline”. The couple, who are residents of Mumbai, had moved court, saying they are facing torture from her family, the sarpanch and community members of their village in Gujarat. She was assaulted and married off forcibly to another man, who raped her. She fled to Mumbai in August and filed a detailed complaint. The judges heard that the Powai police did not act on it. In September, her father-in-law was assaulted at his residence by the man who forcibly married her in Gujarat. They said if the police had acted on her August complaint, the September attack could have been avoided. “Because police have not taken action, it emboldened this man,’’ Justice Kathawalla said. Nagrale said he was not aware of the details of the case but perhaps the IO felt there were too many issues involved such as her going to the village, second marriage and the husband’s complaint of Rs 7 lakh jewellery theft by her. “Is it not the IO’s duty to find out? Why is the police force so insensitive? In the city if such things happen, what will happen in the interiors of the state?” asked Justice Kathawalla. Advocate Murtaza Najmi, appearing for the woman’s father and brother, claimed they are also being oppressed by the community. “As a father, he should have stood by his daughter...You allowed your daughter to be raped. Credit should be given to the husband who stood by her despite what happened,’’ said Justice Kathawalla. When the brother said his wife and child were attacked, the judge said: “You are supporting the samaj. As you sow, so you reap.’’ The matter will be heard on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/this-is-how-you-protect-women-city-police-have-no-discipline-in-mumbai-hc/articleshow/87655646.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Ahmedabad||After Covid lull, Ahmedabad societies put redevelopment on fast track||AHMEDABAD: Cracked walls, fragile roofs, and leaking pipes – residents of old societies had to continue living with these problems when they were forced to put their redevelopment plans on the backburner due to Covid-19. However, things are finally looking up for them as Ahmedabad witnesses a flurry of proposals and consent for redevelopment of old and dilapidated residential buildings. Around 105 societies, mainly low-rises in posh western areas, have either agreed or are in the midst of signing MoUs with developers to raze and rebuild their houses. Of these, 55 societies gave their consent in 2021. In September 2018, the state government amended the Gujarat Ownership Flats Act (1972) to allow redevelopment of societies with consent of 75%, instead of 100%, members. “This gave a boost to redevelopment projects. However, the situation turned gloomy when Covid struck. People feared going for redevelopment as they did not want to move to rented houses or feared delay in project execution due to the pandemic. Since the beginning of 2020, however, around 105 societies have chosen to go for redevelopment. On an average, 3-4 societies have applied for redevelopment every month since January this year,” said an AMC official. In all, some 1,100 low-rise societies which are 25 years or older are eligible for redevelopment, reveals data from the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s town planning department. These 2- or 3-storeyed buildings are mainly concentrated in areas like Navrangpura, Paldi, Stadium, Vadaj, Vasna, Maninagar, parts of Chandkheda, parts of Naroda, and newly incorporated old AUDA areas in the western part of the city. “Developers are targeting low-rise societies in western areas so that they can exploit the underutilized Floor Space Index (FSI) of 3.6 and 2.7 to transform the space into a 14-storeyed apartment,” adds the AMC official. Jitendra Shah, founder of the recently formed 80-member urban redevelopment housing society welfare association (URHSWA), claims that his association members are in talks with 67 housing societies and 15 projects are currently underway. “The underutilized FSI of old low-rise societies works best for developers. For instance, in posh areas like Navrangpura, 60% of project benefits go to residents in terms of the apartment, transit fee, gift money or extra space as well as new amenities while 40% comes back to us as earnings.” He adds that most residents prefer to return to redeveloped flats due to their familiarity with the area and proximity to their relatives, provisions and neighbours. Confirming this, Hemant Zariwala, a resident of Vivekanand society in Jodhpur, says, "One of the major advantages of the redevelopment process is that we get an option of gift money compensation against the extra space. The developer will install furnishings in the area with that sum. Also, we do not have to leave our familiar neighbourhood for better housing options. We took seven months to finalise our redevelopment.” Chitrak Shah, the vice-president of CREDAI-Ahmedabad GIHED, a body of city-based real estate developers, says, “Redevelopment activity in Ahmedabad is gradually gaining traction. Previously, obtaining 100% consent was a challenge. However, with 75% norm coming in, redevelopment of old housing societies in the city has received a boost.” However, not many societies have been able to exact agreements from its members. Alpesh Patel, secretary of a society in Jodhpur, points out, “Having the agreement of 75% members may not work at all times. Ours is a 50-year-old dilapidated society where just two out of the 78 members have disagreed and stalled redevelopment. This was because we had protested when they were operating an office and godown from our residential society earlier. The government should include a mechanism in the GOF Act to mediate in such matters where the will of most is at stake.” “There are 6,714 societies in the city that are registered under the Co-Operative Societies Act, 1962. Most of these societies will be eligible for redevelopment in the next 3-7 years,” says a senior AMC official. Chitrak Shah, who is also managing director and co-founder of Shivalik Group which is already implementing two redevelopment projects in the city and has a few more in the pipeline, says, “Through redevelopment, societies that are 25 or 30 years old will get better facilities and amenities. Apart from profit, intention of redevelopment ur intention is also to provide a better skyline to Ahmedabad.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/after-covid-lull-abad-societies-put-redevelopment-on-fast-track/articleshow/87654576.cms||Paul John
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Schools conduct safety check ahead of NAS today||KOLKATA: Select schools have made arrangements for kids of classes III, V and VIII to take the National Achievement Survey on campus on Friday. The biggest rooms have been earmarked for the exam. On Thursday, these ‘survey rooms’ were sanitised after distanced seating arrangements were made. Reminders have been sent to parents so kids reach school between 7.30am and 8am. After attendance, lots will be drawn for 30 kids per class to be taken for the test. In West Bengal 3,165 schools have been chosen for NAS. The field investigators, who are officials of the education department, and the observers, who are teachers of CBSE schools, reported to the respective co-ordinators on Thursday and a final count was taken in the evening. Some observers collected the survey materials from the co-ordinators on Thursday evening while others will do so by 6am on Friday, before reaching schools by 8am. On Thursday, rosters were prepared by schools to send out teachers to other venues as observers. No teacher from the host school will be allowed to enter its survey room. “The rooms have been fumigated and sanitised, and hand sanitisers have been placed at vantage points. Covid-related signs were put up. A fully equipped isolation room with a nurse has been set up. Our teachers made the kids practice on OMR sheets so that they can familiarise themselves with the technique,” said Koeli Dey, principal of Sushila Birla Girls’ School. St Augustine’s Day School, Shyamnagar, has got its safety protocol assessed and certified by the Quality Council of India before NAS because only Class III children will be assessed here. “We reminded parents about the entry time and the items kids have to carry, like HB pencil, eraser, two masks, sanitiser, water bottle and a small packet of biscuits,” said principal Father Rodney Borneo. South Point High School has sanitised the building and conducted anti-viral treatment. “We have worked on routes kids can take so there is least cross-traffic,” said spokesperson Krishna Damani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/schools-conduct-safety-check-ahead-of-nas-today/articleshow/87654426.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Ahmedabad||Coming soon to Ahmedabad: Helicopter joyrides, air ambulance & seaplane||GANDHINAGAR: The government of Gujarat has set the bar high - quite literally as high as the sky - as it plans to roll out a slew of pre-Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit (VGGS) attractions that will unleash a flurry of activities in Gujarat’s skies. The state civil aviation department, in association with the tourism department, is in the final stages of planning to start helicopter joyrides in the sky over Ahmedabad city. The state has also committed to finally starting its own air ambulance service, providing helicopters on hire to persons to visit places of religious or tourist attraction and most importantly, restarting the Ahmedabad-Kevadiya seaplane service. Top sources in the state government said necessary approvals to operate these services have already been secured from the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and other central government agencies and these attractions will be rolled out before the 2022 edition of the VGGS slated to be held in January. In 2019, the state government purchased a swanky Bombardier Challenger 650 aircraft at the cost of Rs 191 crore. The Beechcraft Super King aircraft, which was being used for dignitaries for the past 20 years before the Bombardier aircraft was purchased, will be converted into an air ambulance. “All necessary approvals for this have been secured for converting the plane into an air ambulance,” officials told TOI. The much publicised seaplane service between Ahmedabad and the Statue of Unity at Kevadiya in Narmada district could not sustain for too long and was discontinued within weeks of being launched last October. Launched amid much fanfare, the sea plane service operated by a private aviation company, has been suspended multiple times since its launch in October 2020 and is not operational as of now. “This time, the state civil aviation department will operate the service between the Sabarmati Riverfront and Kevadiya,” sources said. In what will give a huge boost to recreational activities in Ahmedabad, the government will begin helicopter joyrides in Ahmedabad’s skies on weekends. “The helicopters are likely to take off and land from some point along the riverfront,” officials said. These same helicopters will be rented out to people during the weekdays, officials said. “There are many families who would be interested in visiting religious places like Ambaji or Dwarka or other places where there is no air connectivity as of now. Such persons will be able to hire these helicopters during the week,” said government officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/coming-soon-to-abad-helicopter-joyrides-air-ambulance-seaplane/articleshow/87654531.cms||Kapil Dave
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat’s ‘mad tree’ can be a good one too||RAJKOT: The much-maligned gando baval or prosopis juliflora (PJ) — the invasive ‘alien’ weed that ravaged large swathes of traditional grassland in Kutch decimating livelihood of Banni people — may have the last laugh if a scientific paper can save its existence. For years now, there has been a discussion to eradicate the weed to save the Banni grassland mostly under the demand of the locals. But, a paper recently published by GUIDE (Gujarat Institute of Desert Ecology), suggested making a separate management policy for PJ, as the weed has the capacity to generate lakhs of employment and can usher in major change in the entire ecosystem of Kutch’s Banni land. The paper suggests that PJ can be used in making bread, biscuit, syrup, coffee, cocktails and even brandy apart from its wood being used in making charcoal and generating electricity. It says that PJ’s multifarious usage is well known in various countries, though it has generated very little awareness about its full potential. The paper published in Global Journal of Science Frontier Research suggested better usage with a policy intervention to generate new industry and new employment. It, however, stated that this option is very expensive and practically not possible looking at the experience of other countries. Talking to TOI, one of the authors of this paper and director of GUIDE, V Vijay Kumar said, “We need to make a separate management policy for PJ. We have considered it an alien species but it has economic and environmental potential. We have to make a new management plan for PJ considering its positive and negative points.” Kumar further said that proper planning can help generate massive employment opportunities and usher in economic development to the arid land. Prosopis pods after removing the seeds are rich in protein and glucose. Pods could be useful for making cattle feed mixture, edible biscuits, energy tonic for old people and children, coffee, brandy, prosopis tree gum, but its products are not popular in India and for that spreading of awareness is necessary. In 2009, GUIDE published a research paper named “Prosposis: Ecological, economic significance and management challenges” in which they mentioned the potential capabilities of gando baval . According to the paper, this is an invasive alien species that spreads rapidly — the only negative point of the plant species — but that if this could be controlled, mankind can reap huge benefits from it. Its wood proved to be an important source of domestic fuel in rural households in the last century. The wood burns evenly and does not spark or smoke excessively and the calorific value of wood is quite high. The other use of gando baval wood is for charcoal and electricity generation. The biomass produced from it is used in electricity generation and can generate one MW electricity from 6,169 tonnes of fuel wood. The cost of power generation from PJ is also very cheap.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarats-mad-tree-can-be-a-good-one-too/articleshow/87654548.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

With this, they have become the first Indians to receive the honour. The younger sibling, Faizan, got the national award at a ceremony in Dallas on Tuesday. Speaking on the occasion, he said, “Since the future of a country is dependent on its kids, we began nurturing and mentoring schoolchildren so that they could identify real-world problems and come up with patentable solutions.” Hailing the work of the Mirza brothers, the Freedoms Foundation stated in its 2020-2021 awards booklet, “They are being recognised for their significant contribution to education. Rizwan developed a step-by-step process to help students think like scientists and innovators while Faizan founded the DiscoverSTEM in Plano as part of which kids solve real-world problems.” Rizwan, an alumnus of Indian Institute of Management-Bengaluru and HEC Paris, told TOI over the phone on Thursday that he conducted an intensive two-year research on STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), innovation, child psychology, and learning patterns. On the basis of his research, he prepared a module to mentor kids, make them think like innovators, identify problems, and create patentable solutions. In the process, he co-founded DiscoverSTEM in Texas in 2016. “Since children are out-of-the-box thinkers, they come up with very bright and promising ideas. However, they lack a structured thought process and do not know how to convert an idea into an innovation. That’s why I want to make a difference and give children the right platform to work on their ideas and come up with unique solutions,” Rizwan, who is in Bengaluru at present, said and added that 25 of their students had been awarded for their innovations by the NASA. Sharing a good news with the students here, Rizwan said the DiscoverSTEM Innovation Lab would become functional in India soon. “A large number of our students in the US belong to the Indian diaspora. Hence, we are in the process of launching the programme here as well,” he claimed. Speaking about Rizwan’s DiscoverSTEM programme, Charles A Rodenberger, a top NASA scientist, said, “As a scientist, I have been part of several intensive brainstorming and innovation sessions. I saw similar activities being conducted at DiscoverSTEM, one of the best STEM and Innovation programmes.” Hashima Hasan, another NASA scientist who holds a PhD in nuclear physics, pointed out, “A small mentoring programme, which began in 2016, has evolved so much that its students are winning awards and patenting their innovations.” The Freedoms Foundation was started by former US President Dwight D Eisenhower in 1949.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/in-a-first-2-brothers-from-patna-bag-us-award-for-making-kids-innovators/articleshow/87652304.cms||---

Similarly, a fuel station at Talapady on the border of Dakshina Kannada too has been witnessing an increase in sales considerably as the prices of petrol and diesel are cheaper than Kerala. Meanwhile, the tax cut in Karnataka has impacted a fuel station on the border near Kunjathur in Kerala very badly. The fuel station, which is located just 500 meters away from the DK border at Talapady, lost its large number of customer base after prices were reduced in Karnataka. In fact, the two fuel stations, one in Kerala and another in Karnataka, are less than 500 meters away from each other. Thajuddin, manager of Kerala Fuels at Kunjathur in Kerala, told TOI that the sale reduced by more than 50% after the tax cut in Karnataka. “The sale of petrol in our fuel station reduced drastically from an average of 6,000 litres to 2,000 litres per day. We have been expecting the Kerala government to follow the steps taken by Karnataka to reduce the price. Congress in Opposition in Kerala has been holding protests demanding cut in tax for fuel,” he said. Meanwhile, Galimukha Fuel station at Galimukha has put up banners announcing that petrol and diesel are cheaper by Rs 5 and Rs 8 respectively at their outlet in Karnataka. “Ours is a fuel station located very close to Mulleria town in Kasaragod of Kerala where prices of petrol and diesel costlier. The sale has increased by nearly 60% after the tax reduction by Karnataka. People from border areas of Kerala reach here to fill fuel. Private vehicles and public transportation vehicles from Kerala have been visiting our station to fill fuel. The price of petrol is Rs 100.46 per litre and it is Rs 84.87 for diesel in our station. The price is up by Rs 5 and Rs 8 respectively for petrol and diesel in Kerala,” said Mansukh M, manager of Galimukha Fuel Station. Hameed K, who commutes frequently between Kasaragod and Mangaluru, said, “I fill my car’s fuel tank from Talapady so that I need not pay more in Kerala.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/tax-cut-in-ktaka-sale-in-dk-border-fuel-station-up-by-60/articleshow/87653657.cms||---

Sawant, who was speaking at the National Youth Parliament, said the state is committed to grooming youth in the best possible way to lead democracy. He said if a common man like him could rise to be the chief minister of Goa then there should be no wrong perception that one has to belong to a dynasty to succeed in life. Sawant made a case for the establishment of private universities in the state, such as design and skills universities. There is special focus on upgrading technical education, the chief minister said, for which various youth-oriented courses have been introduced in schools and colleges to provide practical experiences that help them develop skills the industry requires. Only the youth can achieve Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s goal pertaining to the New India Mission, Sawant said, adding that his government has been working tirelessly to provide the best possible facilities for the youth. Speaker of the state legislative assembly, Rajesh Patnekar, who was also present, said, “Adaptation and evolution is the key to success for youth. The youth of today are blessed with technology, which they can tap for seamless e-governance to reshape and revamp this country. The very foundation of active youth participation will rest on knowledge-sharing and networking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-calls-for-more-young-people-in-politics/articleshow/87655170.cms||---

In a bid to get the arithmetic right ahead of the electoral fray, AAP has promised to appoint a chief minister from the Bhandari community if it wins the elections. With the party looking to make strong inroads into Salcete — a Catholic dominated taluka and Congress’ traditional turf, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said during a press conference that the deputy chief minister will be from the Christian community. But he stopped short of announcing any names. The party is yet to declare its candidates for the coming polls. Gomantak Bhandari Samaj’s Ashok Naik recently said that the organisation will support any national party that offers maximum seats to its members at the upcoming assembly elections. AAP national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal met Naik and members of the Bhandari community. “We want to give representation to the Bhandari community in the assembly,” Sisodia said, adding that the Christian community will also be given due importance in the cabinet He said that Congress and BJP have used the Bhandari community and the minorities for their own political gains, but never gave proper representation to the two communities which form a major chunk of Goa’s electorate. Sisodia, who is in Goa to review the preparations for the upcoming elections, said that all religious communities and castes will be given representation in the cabinet if AAP wins a majority in the elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-woos-bhandari-samaj-christians-promises-top-posts/articleshow/87655164.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

While many couples who tied the knot during the first and second iterations of the pandemic promoted awareness about Covid-19 safety norms, on Wednesday, 29-year-old Suchit, who holds an MTech degree, and engineering graduate Rajani, marked their special day here on Wednesday, requesting guests to pledge their eyes for their wedding present. As many as 200 guests to the event were inspired by the bride and groom, who had already pledged their eyes, to follow suit, and pledge their eyes to the SGM Eye Bank.The son of Lingaraj Angadi, former president of the Dharwad unit of the Kannada Sahitya Parishat, Suchit said that he had initially wanted to organise a voluntary blood donation camp at the wedding venue. “But I was informed about the logistical problems this entailed, and decided against it. But I was committed to making a difference to society on the day of my wedding, and that was when we came up with the idea of ‘eye donation pledge’ initiative at the venue,” Suchit told TOI.Generosity appears to the young man’s second nature, given that he has donated blood and platelets a staggering 58 times, besides starting a group called ‘SamVruksha’, the primary aim of which is to help arrange blood for patients in the event of an emergency. Suchit appears to have imbibed this streak to do better by others from his father Lingaraj, who has donated blood 38 times himself.After consultations with Suchit and Rajani, a dedicated counter where guests could fill up a form making a commitment to donate their eyes was set up at the wedding hall, said Dr Srinivas Joshi and Dr Aniket Shastri, SGM Eye Bank officebearers. “Since 2014, four couples who tied the knot in Hubballi have organised such an initiative to mark their wedding day. We observed that people from villages, who were among the guests at the wedding, too volunteered to donate their eyes. More than marking up the number of those who pledge their eyes, it is about raising awareness,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/couple-asks-guests-to-pledgetheir-eyes-as-wedding-gift/articleshow/87653669.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

Mahamandaleshwar Kakeshwari Nandgiri became the center of attraction when she started crawling to the ghat which is around 5 km away from her house. She is also observing 72 hours fast for the well being and prosperity of the nation and her Yajman (clients). “From last 12 years, I have been observing Chhath fast and celebrating the festival following all customs and traditions. Few years ago, I wished something from ‘Chhathi Maiyya’ and it came true, so I decided to crawl to the ghat to make the deity happy. I have been doing this for three years now, and will continue crawling to the ghat for Chhath puja for two more years,” Mahamandeleshwar said. “I also prayed and asked Chhathi Maiyya to keep us safe from the corona pandemic,” she added. Gorakhpur MP Ravi Kishan inspected various Chhath ghats and extended greetings to all on Wednesday. He also gave directions regarding preparation of Chhath puja at ghat. He reached Rajghat, Ramghat at Rapti ghat, Hanumangarhi, Suryakund dham, Mansarover temple and Bheem sarovar in Gorakhnath temple and took stock of preparations and also took blessings of Guru Gorakshnath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/chhath-puja-kinnar-akhara-mahamandaleshwar-crawls-5km-to-ghat/articleshow/87635381.cms||---
---||Jaipur||After 4 years, SC nod for sand mining from river beds in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: The Supreme Court on Thursday gave sanction to sand mining from river beds in the state and approved recommendations made by the central empowered committee (CEC) constituted to look into the matter. Sand mining from river beds has been allowed after almost four years and lease holders are expected to start operations over the next three months after getting environmental clearance (EC) from the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC). Additional chief secretary, mines and petroleum, Subodh Agarwal said, “With our chief minister's efforts, the long-pending issue of illegal bajri mining has been resolved in the state. This will benefit the public at large. At present, there are three large leases operational and five more are expected to start operations soon. More companies will start work as soon they receive EC.” The CEC, constituted by the apex court to look into the issue of illegal sand mining on December 23, 2020, had submitted its report after carrying out a physical inspection. “The recommendations made by the CEC, except recommendation ‘J’, are approved for implementation forthwith,” the court order says. An official with the mining department said the ‘J’ recommendation referred to levying a penalty of Rs 10 lakh per vehicle and Rs 5 lakh per cubic metre of sand seized. The CEC has recommended the MoEFCC to issue EC to all valid letter of intent (LoI) holders recommended by the expert appraisal committee (EAC) within a period of three months and without insisting on the submission of the scientific replenishment report as a pre-condition. The replenishment study will be undertaken during the course of mining. “Out of 82 large leases, the EAC has recommended 65. After the SC nod, they will receive EC within 3 months from the MoEFCC,” an official mining department source said. The SC had earlier restrained operations of large mining lease holders who did not have EC from the ministry. The ministry had later laid a condition for companies to carry out a scientific replenishment study. In its report, the CEC highlighted the delay in granting EC as the main reason for the widening gap between supply and demand, which resulted in the proliferation of illegal mining activities. Following the order, the state government is likely to earn an estimated revenue of Rs 400 crore per annum. A senior mining department official said, “The 65 large leases can mine an estimated 700 lakh tonne from their operations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/after-4-yrs-sc-nod-for-sandmining-from-river-beds-in-raj/articleshow/87655190.cms||Ajay Singh

Bangur Nagar police have registered an accidental death case.A team from Delhi police had approached the local police on Tuesday for help to nab David Roy, who was booked in a narcotics case in Delhi in 2017. Roy lived in Malad's Evershine Nagar with his family. A joint team reached Roy's apartment to look for him. The team took the housing society watchman along and knocked at Roy's door. But nobody opened the door. The police teams left thinking nobody was home after neighbours said they had not seen Roy for a few days. Later, he was found lying in the society compound and was rushed to the Babasaheb Ambedkar Hospital at Kandivali where doctors pronounced him dead.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-climbs-down-bldg-to-escape-falls-to-his-death/articleshow/87655653.cms||---

---||Pune||Baramati youth dies of dengue within five days of illness onset||Pune: Sixteen-year-old Subhash (name changed on request) from Baramati was admitted to Pune’s KEM hospital on the third day of dengue illness on November 8. The boy developed dengue shock syndrome on the fourth day and slipped into coma. His condition rapidly deteriorated and he died following multi-organ failure, the next day. Just like Subhash, dengue-infected young adults from Pune rural are showing severe symptoms of dengue with a steep drop in blood platelet counts on the third or fourth day of illness as against the slow platelet fall usually setting in from the fifth or sixth day onward. Some of these young adults are also showing well-defined build-up of water inside the lungs (pulmonary edema) at an early stage of dengue illness, doctors said. “In the last 15 days, we have seen more than 25 seriously-ill dengue patients from rural parts of Baramati, Phaltan, Daund and Shirur. In addition to showing a terrible drop in platelet count on the third or fourth day, some of them also show severe lung fluid, which is rarely seen at such an early stage,” KEM hospital’s senior physician Rajesh Gadia told TOI. Gadia has treated more than 10,000 dengue patients in the last 25 years. The patients’ platelet counts taking a nosedive in the first five days of dengue illness has left the doctors puzzled. “On the third or fourth day of the fever, patients are presenting with a platelet count of less than 20,000. This is very early and certainly not a good sign,” Gadia said. A normal person has a platelet count ranging between 1,50,000 and 4,50,000 per microlitre of blood. Usually, about 80-90% of patients with dengue have levels below 1,00,000, while just 10-20% see a critically low level of 20,000 or less. In normal scenarios, when platelets drop on the 5-7th day of illness, doctors monitor patients for a couple of days before taking a call on platelet transfusions. “With an early drop in platelet count, we have to monitor the patients for a prolonged period. Besides, these patients quite often require more platelet transfusions. This puts more load on the existing system and a longer hospital stay,” Gadia said. An early manifestation of complications like pulmonary edema is also adding to the patients’ long hospital stay. “This requires immediate ICU treatment,” Gadia said. This year’s most severe dengue cases, doctors said, were due to secondary dengue. “In secondary dengue, there is an antibody-dependent enhancement. So, platelets drop early with the more severe presentation,” said physician Abhijit Lodha. Usually, about 5% of dengue patients face complications, such as bleeding, which require platelet transfusions. “Platelet transfusion in the absence of bleeding does not prevent bleeding. Such a practice is associated with slower platelet recovery and increased length of hospitalization,” said Ruby Hall Clinic’s chief intensivist Kapil Zirpe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/baramati-youth-dies-of-dengue-within-five-days-of-illness-onset/articleshow/87654461.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The Delhi government came under a lot of fire recently on the toxic froth floating over the Yamuna. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is also going to hold a high-level meeting in this regard on Friday, where progress on key projects related to preventing water contamination will be discussed. Delhi Jal Board plans to replace the water network in contaminated areas. The execution of this work is targeted by January next year, informed a source. As part of this drain, two intervention plans of Najafgarh drain and Barapullah drain to improve the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) level will be discussed. BOD is the amount of oxygen level in the river, which indicates the amount of contamination. These interventions will be done so that the treatment plants and filters by the Delhi government do better. “All water pipelines must be monitored thoroughly so that leakage can be minimised and fixed accordingly. The officials should work to solve this problem on war footing,” said Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/expedite-work-on-sewer-lines-to-protect-yamuna/articleshow/87654464.cms||---

In a statement, Bidhuri said that he is happy that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has stated that it is Delhi government’s responsibility to clean Yamuna, instead of blaming the Centre. He said that the Central Government has always given all possible help to the Delhi Government for this work, including a fund of Rs 2,419 crore for cleaning the river. Delhi government didn’t respond to Bidhuri’s comments despite repeated attempts Bidhuri said that Delhi’s 18 big drains are pouring filth into the river Yamuna every day and alleged that while the state government is making announcements to set up sewage treatment plants, all its projects are far behind schedule. He said that for a positive discussion on this issue, an all-party meeting should be convened in which the opinion of all the elected representatives and experts should be taken. He said that there should be no politics in cleaning the river Yamuna. Bidhuri also asked the CM to give Delhiites relief from fuel prices by bringing down the VAT rates to lower than what they were in 2015 as he had allegedly promised earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/make-time-bound-plan-for-yamuna-cleanup-bidhuri-tells-delhi-govt/articleshow/87655655.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Kolkata||Kolkata citizens’ demand: Keep parks & lakes open for longer hours, give access to children||KOLKATA: Citizens are demanding parks and lakes — that currently have very restricted hours of operation — be kept open longer. While the elderly, who find it difficult to wake up early, and professionals, who leave for work early, have been calling for longer park timings for quite some time, even others are now clamouring for parks and lakes to be open all morning and afternoon now that winter is setting in and the early morning air will be laden with pollutants. Parents also want their children to be given access to parks. TimesViewNow that almost everything else is open, it makes no sense to keep parks functioning according to Covid-restricted timings. Winter mornings are often not the ideal time for outdoor exercise — because of heavy pollution and weather conditions — and keeping parks open throughout the day will actually contribute to a healthier city.“Across the city, life is getting back to normal. There is no restriction other than late at night. Malls, movie theatres and activities in other closed spaces have been permitted months earlier. Yet, entry to parks, where risk of transmission is very low, continues to be severely restricted, both in terms of access and timings,” said lawyer Ankit Agarwal, who has been trying to highlight the issue for several months. Those who frequent Rabindra Sarobar, too, want the time of operation to be extended from 6am to 9am and 4pm to 6pm at present to 6am-7pm operation hours so that people can walk in later in the morning, afternoon or evening. “I doubt if restricting entry to parks and lakes ever made sense, but even if it did, persisting with the restricted timings is absurd, particularly now that winter is around and doctors advise avoiding early-morning walks and going for exercise later in the day when the sun is up. I believe it is really a manpower issue rather than Covid that has prompted the authorities to continue with the shorter hours,” said S M Ghosh, a Lake regular. He also argued that while turnout at the Lake will increase when timings are relaxed, it will be spread out through the day and not lead to crowding in the morning. Joydeep Dutta Gupta, another regular at the Lake, has been unable to understand the logic behind the restricted timings and also of keeping children out of the only places they can safely play outdoors. “Lakes and parks should be open till at least 11am and then again from 2pm or 3pm,” he said. Parents and school principals are demanding that children be allowed to access parks and lakes that have been off-limits for over a year-and-a-half. “Children have suffered the most in the last year-and-a-half due to the pandemic — no schools, few engagements with friends and hardly any excursion. They really have no place to go as opposed to adults who may go to work and meet friends. Many children are beginning to have issues related to motor movements and confidence, resulting in therapy intervention,” said Kaavya Gupta, a parent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/citizens-demand-keep-parks-lakes-open-for-longer-hours-give-access-to-children/articleshow/87654459.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The police identified the accused as Akhil, 21, of Kadakampally and Sujith, 31, of Muttathara. Both accused are friends and daily wage labourers by profession. The police said that the two men were arrested after receiving a complaint from the mother of a 14-year-old school girl. The complainant stated in her petition that she had bought her daughter a smartphone for attending online classes. But the girl used the phone to create accounts in social media apps such as Whatsapp and Instagram. Akhil got acquainted with her through Instagram and he started sending lewd messages to her. When the mother found out about this, she seized the phone from the girl. But to her shock, Akhil and Sujith turned up at her home and threatened her. It was following this that she filed a complaint before the police. The accused went absconding after the police registered a case and launched the probe. They were held from a hideout in the city by a team led by Pettah station house officer Inspector Riyas Raja and sub inspector P Ratheesh. Besides charges under POCSO Act, the accused were also booked under sections related to house trespass and criminal intimidation. Following the arrest, the accused were produced before the court and remanded in judicial custody.

The state’s active cases per million population as on November 9 were 105, lower than Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Mizoram, Telangana, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur and Meghalaya, the data stated. Maharashtra’s additional chief secretary (health) Dr Pradeep Vyas said, “Though Maharashtra has the second highest active cases in India in terms of absolute numbers, its actual disease burden is much lower than several other states if the number of Covid-19 cases are calculated per million population.” A senior official with the state health department told TOI that calculating the number of Covid-19 cases per million population is the scientific way to compare state-wise burden of any disease, because different states have different population sizes. Maharashtra is the second-most populous state in India after Uttar Pradesh. “Absolute Covid-19 cases in various states cannot convey the real picture of the disease burden in a region. Hence the per million population method is used. For instance, if 50 are infected in a population of 100 people in a state, the attack rate is 50% there. Similarly, if 20 out of 100 are infected in another state, the attack rate is 20% there,” the official said. Health department data showed that Maharashtra’s active cases per million population have also dropped lower than the national average of 116. As on October 26, Maharashtra’s active cases per million residents was 181, which was higher than the national average 135. Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Telangana then had lower active cases per million population in comparison to Maharashtra. State Covid-19 Task Force member Dr Shashank Joshi told TOI, “In the past, Maharashtra did have the second highest active Covid-19 cases per million population among other states, but the situation improved with a consistent drop in new Covid-19 cases. However, a word of caution: states such as Maharashtra and Kerala should not reduce their testing. Testing has gone down in both the states, which should be addressed as soon as possible. We may see a post-festive spike, thus the state needs to be vigilant.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/active-cases/mn-population-in-maha-lower-than-8-states/articleshow/87657517.cms||Neha Madaan

The case against them is stayed by the HC. The survivor’s father told the court that the shop where the rape took place was close to his house. He said that while the main accused worked in the shop, the second accused and his brother ran the shop. The father further said that he had separated from the survivor’s mother in 2010. In 2013, his children went to a fair and met their mother. The mother called him and said that she had asked the girl why her stomach was bloated, but got no answer. Her mother then took her for a sonography that showed the minor was eight months pregnant. The survivor then alleged that the two men drugged and repeatedly raped her in 2012. They had also threatened to kill her father and brother if she told anyone what had happened. Special public prosecutor Geeta Sharma cited the evidence of 13 witnesses, including the survivor and her father, to seek the conviction of the first accused. The prosecution also submitted that DNA evidence showed he was the father of the child. Special Pocso judge Bharti Kale also fined him Rs 20,000. He has been in jail since his arrest in July 2014. His sentence will be set off against time spent in prison as an undertrial. The other parties in the case -- the brother of an accused and two locals were acquitted of charges of failing to report offences against a minor under the Pocso Act. They were also found not guilty for offences under the Child Marriage Restraint Act.

---||Hubballi||Couple asks guests to pledgetheir eyes as wedding gift||Hubballi: Educated youngsters eager to do their bit for a brighter tomorrow are turning their weddings into more than the routine assembly of family and friends. While many couples who tied the knot during the first and second iterations of the pandemic promoted awareness about Covid-19 safety norms, on Wednesday, 29-year-old Suchit, who holds an MTech degree, and engineering graduate Rajani, marked their special day here on Wednesday, requesting guests to pledge their eyes for their wedding present. As many as 200 guests to the event were inspired by the bride and groom, who had already pledged their eyes, to follow suit, and pledge their eyes to the SGM Eye Bank. The son of Lingaraj Angadi, former president of the Dharwad unit of the Kannada Sahitya Parishat, Suchit said that he had initially wanted to organise a voluntary blood donation camp at the wedding venue. “But I was informed about the logistical problems this entailed, and decided against it. But I was committed to making a difference to society on the day of my wedding, and that was when we came up with the idea of ‘eye donation pledge’ initiative at the venue,” Suchit told TOI. Generosity appears to the young man’s second nature, given that he has donated blood and platelets a staggering 58 times, besides starting a group called ‘SamVruksha’, the primary aim of which is to help arrange blood for patients in the event of an emergency. Suchit appears to have imbibed this streak to do better by others from his father Lingaraj, who has donated blood 38 times himself. After consultations with Suchit and Rajani, a dedicated counter where guests could fill up a form making a commitment to donate their eyes was set up at the wedding hall, said Dr Srinivas Joshi and Dr Aniket Shastri, SGM Eye Bank officebearers. “Since 2014, four couples who tied the knot in Hubballi have organised such an initiative to mark their wedding day. We observed that people from villages, who were among the guests at the wedding, too volunteered to donate their eyes. More than marking up the number of those who pledge their eyes, it is about raising awareness,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/couple-asks-guests-to-pledgetheir-eyes-as-wedding-gift/articleshow/87654490.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai
---||Nashik||Probe into baby’s death; parents say no help with delivery||Nashik: Dr Ashok Thorat, the Nashik civil surgeon, has ordered a probe into a newborn’s death at the hospital. Kira Gare, a tribal woman from the Peth taluka, had delivered a baby boy on Tuesday, November 9. The baby died in the morning on Thursday, November 11. For almost eight hours, the aggrieved parents refused to take the body. They relented and took their newborn’s body in the afternoon only after being assured of a proper investigation. The civil surgeon told TOI that he set up a committee after Kailas Gare, the father, made allegations. “I have directed the panel to submit a report within 24 hours. We will decide the course of action after the committee submits its report,” said Thorat. Gare said that his wife was admitted to the hospital early on November 9. “After her admission, when she was going to the toilet, a sweeper at the hospital misbehaved with her and even beat her up. Later, she went into labour and was taken to the delivery room. However, during her delivery, there was no doctor or nurse to help her,” he added. He also approached the Sarkarwada police with a complaint. Kira Gare had delivered the baby around 9 am on November 9. According to her, barring a female relative, there was no one else with her in the labour room. “When I was giving birth, there was no doctor or nurse to hold the baby as it came out. My baby fell into a small bed between my legs, and sustained head injuries,” she alleged. The hospital’s gynaecology department officials refuted the allegation. “Nurses were present during the delivery, which was guided by Dr Promod Chaudhari. It was a case of premature birth of a baby with extremely high blood pressure,” officials added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/probe-into-babys-death-parents-say-no-help-with-delivery/articleshow/87653030.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Delhi||Delhi: Vehicles biggest source of local pollution, says study||NEW DELHI: Vehicles have emerged as the biggest contributor to particulate pollution in Delhi. Their real-time share of vehicular emissions in air pollution has increased to over 50% in early winter (October 24-November 8) this year, says a new analysis released on Thursday by the Centre for Science and Environment. Track the pollution level in your cityCSE has analysed the real-time data on the comparative contributions of different sources to the pollutants in the city’s air compiled by Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology. CSE accessed data for every alternate hour for the October 24- November 8 period. The pollution sources include transport, industry, construction, waste burning, energy, residential sources, road dust and other groups of sources. Stubble burning and pollution across the National Capital Region were not considered. The analysis shows vehicular pollution at more than half of all sources, followed by household pollution between 12.5 and 13.5%. Industry contributed 9.9-13.7% of the pollutants, construction 6.7-7.9%, waste burning 4.6-4.9% and road dust, 3.6-4.1%. This indicative composition is based on the trend every alternate hour in each 24 hours of the study period. An additional CSE analysis of the traffic speed in the city — a measure of congestion — on 15 key stretches during the study period shows that traffic congestion is back to pre-pandemic levels and correlates with the pollution peaks. The traffic speed improved dramatically during the lockdown in 2020. The mean travel speed now is 26 kmph and in peak hours, 23 kmph. In off-peak hours, it is 32 kmph. The speed in the same period in 2019 was 23 kmph in the peak hour, showing traffic build-up has returned to pre-Covid levels, the report said. The CSE report added, “While Delhi needs to speed up action on all key sources of pollution, it requires urgent action to scale up integrated public transport systems, walking and cycling infrastructure, and city-wide parking area management plans to restrain vehicle use. In absence of this reform, Delhi is unable to enforce emergency action to control traffic volumes during smog episodes. Vehicle numbers are explosive at 1.3 crore.” Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), CSE, said, “After the closure of all coal-based power plants, expansion of natural gas usage in industry and controls on dirty fuels, vehicles have emerged as the biggest real-time contributor among the local sources of winter pollution in Delhi this year. Action on transportation has to gather strong momentum. At the same time, action on waste management, clean energy access in households and dust control must be speeded up.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vehicles-biggest-source-of-local-pollution-study/articleshow/87655681.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Pune||Covid tests in Maharashtra dip to 5.58 lakh during festive week||PUNE: Covid detection tests in Maharashtra came down to 5.58 lakh during the Diwali festivities in the November 3-9 week from an average of over 10-11 lakh during the seven-day period in September and October. The recent number of weekly tests in the state was the lowest in the past two months. Public health officials attributed the drop to the festivities and a consistent decline in Covid cases. The Maharashtra task force has now directed the government to scale up the testing, especially in districts with a higher weekly positivity than the state average (1.3%). Public health department registered 3,23,150 RT-PCR and 2,35,813 rapid antigen tests between November 3 and 9 with 17 districts conducting less than 5,000 tests during the period. The highest weekly tests were registered from Mumbai (2.05 lakh), followed by Thane (85,033), Pune (63,044) and Raigad (26,455). The lowest weekly tests were registered in Bhandara (370). “Ten districts continued to register a higher weekly positivity than the state’s average and the testing should be increased there. We cannot be complacent on testing,” task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said. State health minister Rajesh Tope had told TOI that November would be “a crucial month”, due to crowding during the recent festivities. With the state having a capacity to conduct 2-2.5 lakh tests, the districts have been told to not reduce testing. Tope said tests had dropped due to the low daily detections and fewer contacts to track. “We have told the districts to keep a close watch on the situation, especially after the festive season,” he said. From October 31, the daily testing had registered a drop from 1.03 lakh a day to 60,055 till November 8. State task force member Dr Rahul Pandit said the next two weeks were extremely important. He said, “Though most districts in the state are registering lower cases than in the past, testing cannot be reduced. It is crucial to detect the cases at the earliest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covid-tests-in-maharashtra-dip-to-5-58-lakh-during-festive-week/articleshow/87654470.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The cyber cell of Kolkata Police have now claimed to have busted a gang from Darbhanga in Bihar and Madhupur Jharkhand - with their operational base in Mumbai - that had set up a fake website in the name of one of the world’s leading logistics companyand offered to ship electronic items at huge discounted rates on the occasion of Independence Day last August. The accused asked customers - mainly traders from central Kolkata - to make payments in two separate accounts before receiving the goods. The communication was through a fake email ID. The cops found one of these accounts was being operated from Mumbai, the other from Thailand. The cops traced more than two dozen IMEI numbers and reached the accused at Darbhanga. The accused, Shibu Saryug Ray (34), was brought to Kolkata and produced at a local court where he has been sent to police custody till November 20. The FIR was lodged on August 20 this year. “The accused persons had entered into a criminal conspiracy and in pursuant to that dishonestly and fraudulently created one fake website and several fake and misleading mail IDs in the name of the reputed firm and its management. The complainant in this case had visited the website to order some articles required for his business and to ensure they are shipped quickly. Thereafter, the miscreants induced the complainant - by their false representation and assurance of delivery of product - and induced the complainant to pay Rs52 lakh as cost of material and shipment in multiple transactions. Three accounts were provided to him - that of a private sector bank in Mumbai and two foreign bank accounts based in Thailand,” said an investigating officer. “During the investigation we collected the account details, mobile numbers. e-mail address and IMPS details associated with the bank accounts. We also found that the accused persons used huge numbers of IMEI and SIM cards to carry out the fraud. After scrutinizing the IP addresses, IMEI and phone numbers, it was found that the accused person operated from Mumbai but had strong connections with Darbhanga and Madhupur. We constantly tried tracing the phones of the accused and found that he was in Darbhanga and was moving around in the area. A raid was conducted a couple of days ago at Darbhanga and the accused was finally arrested for his direct complicity in the case. A huge incriminating item has been seized from his possession,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cyber-fraud/articleshow/87654497.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Though hundreds of complaints have been filed by residents and councillors for cleaning dirty lanes that may become a breeding grounds for mosquitoes, the company responsible for lifting garbage has been working at a slow pace. There are more than 6,000 dirty lanes in Walled City. Dirty lane is a space given between houses in Walled City for ventilation. Over the years, these lanes have become a dumping ground for garbage. JMC-Heritage councillor Manak Sharma said his area has many kacchi-basti and dirty lanes. “I have written to the mayor, commissioner and deputy commissioner of the zone but nothing has been done. Residents are worried about the impact of dengue on them due to garbage,” said Sharma. When asked about cleaning the lanes, the health deputy commissioner at JMC-Heritage, Ashish Kumar said, “The BVG company has started the process of cleaning the lanes. We have made a WhatsApp group as well in which every complaint is lodged. All the wards will be covered as per plan although it will take some time as the resources for cleaning the lanes are limited.” Many councillors have used their own resources clean the lanes. Councillor Rahees Qureshi said since the number of dirty lanes in his ward was not very high, he was using his own resources to get the lanes cleaned. In Kishanpole, Ramganj and Hawa Mahal areas, there are hundreds of dirty lanes that are filled with garbage. Giriraj Natha, ward 69 councillor, said he cleaned more than 60 lanes in his area using his own resources. “There are around 350 dirty lanes in my area and despite repeated calls to JMC-Heritage, nothing has been done. We have complained many times, but want a final resolution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/amidst-dengue-spread-walled-city-residents-demand-cleaning-of-dirty-lanes/articleshow/87655193.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh adds married daughters in dependents’ list for government jobs||LUCKNOW: Married daughters of government officials, who die during their service period, would also be eligible to get a government job under deceased dependent quota. In a significant development, the state cabinet headed by CM Yogi Adityanath has green- flagged the proposal to include “married daughters” in the category of dependents of deceased government officials to be given a government job on compassionate grounds. The move could potentially lend a renewed traction to BJP's campaign vis-a-vis women empowerment ahead of the UP polls due early next year. The state cabinet cleared the proposal to this effect through a by-circulation late Wednesday night. Until now, only the wife, a married/unmarried son and unmarried daughter were bracketed as dependents of a deceased government official. The cabinet broadened the definition of "dependent daughters" to include the married ones also, officials said. A senior official, however, said that the married daughter will be lower down the order after the deceased's wife, married/unmarried son and unmarried daughter. "She may also get the job if other family members refuse to take up a government job," an official said. The proposal was moved as the 12th amendment in the deceased government servants rule 2021. Earlier this year, the Allahabad high court had maintained that excluding married daughters from the definition of “family” in the rules for appointment on compassionate grounds was “unconstitutional” and in violation of Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution. While hearing a petition in January, the high court held that a married daughter was “no less eligible” for government jobs on compassionate grounds than her married brother or unmarried sister. The court was hearing a petition by one Manjul Srivastava, who had challenged a June 2020 order of Prayagraj’s district basic education officer, rejecting her claim to the appointment on compassionate grounds following her father's death during his service to the state government. The state cabinet also approved the `Matrbhoomi Scheme’ allowing people, who have settled in bigger cities/abroad to contribute to the development of their native village. If a person is willing to bear 60% cost, government will contribute remaining 40%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-adds-married-daughters-in-dependents-list-for-govt-jobs/articleshow/87655663.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Comply with promotion norms or face fund cuts, UGC warns Rajasthan varsity||JAIPUR: Taking cognizance of a complaint by Rajasthan University syndicate member Ram Lakhan Meena regarding non-compliance with the University Grant Commission (UGC) norms during the promotion of faculty members, the Commission has issued a warning letter to the varsity. On Thursday, a letter was sent to the university vice-chancellor stating that the varsity should reply within 15 days informing whether any violation of norms had taken place, failing which UGC might withhold financial assistance to the varsity. According to the complaint, the university had given promotions to faculty members, who had retired between 2012 to 2020, which is against the UGC norms. Meena said the university administration had granted promotions in gross-negligence of the rules. "Despite raising objections, the university administration gave promotions to teachers retired between 2012-20. This is sheer violation of the norms. The UGC has written V-C many times before the promotions were granted. Now, if university grant is stopped, the administration will be responsible," said Meena. According to an estimate, Rajasthan University gets more than Rs 40 crore as financial aid from Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) every year. Higher education secretary Narain Lal Meena said he was not aware about the letter. "The letter wasn’t put up in front of me. I am aware of the earlier letter sent by the UGC to Rajasthan University, though. We had asked the university to follow the rules and regulations laid down. If this wasn’t done, we will look into it. However, I am yet to receive the latest letter," said Meena.

An official from the health department of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) said some of the vaccination sites were receiving a very low response. Such sites’ staffers would be diverted to door-to-door vaccination counselling and survey work. “In this process, some of the sites would be closed temporarily,” said the official. Suryakant Devkar, the chief immunization officer of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), told TOI that they had achieved 100% first dose vaccination, but they would make sure that the areas reporting low vaccination were surveyed because the “Har Ghar Dastak” drive was mandatory. “We shall not close a single vaccination site because at least 12 lakh beneficiaries would be eligible for the second dose in the last week of November and December. We shall, however, make sure that if any vaccination sites have extra staff members, they are allocated to the duty of ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ drive,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/staff-from-low-performing-vax-sites-in-har-ghar-dastak-drive/articleshow/87654506.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Sources in HAL said the work on the infrastructure required for immigration checkpoints started in November 2020, after a nod from the Union Home Ministry. The Bureau of Immigration, Mumbai, has guided HAL in setting up the facilities like separate sections for international arrivals and departures, customs office, immigration counters etc at the sensitive airport. HAL has segregated the domestic and international wings at the airport with separate entry/exit points at both wings. HAL sources added that the Bureau of Immigration will conduct a final inspection following which, the Union Home Ministry will formally announce making the immigration checkposts operational at the Nashik airport. This will pave way for the commencement of international flights directly from the airport. Airport officials said starting international flights from Nashik will ease the pressure on the Mumbai airport and would also benefit international passengers from north Maharashtra. There already is a seating capacity of 200 international passengers, and there is scope for further expansion at the terminal for international flights. The seating capacity will be increased as per the requirement. Local MP Hemant Godse said there is huge scope for direct Nashik to Jeddah flights for Haj pilgrims from Nashik and adjoining districts of north Maharashtra. At present, Haj pilgrims from Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon, Nandurbar and Ahmednagar have to travel to Mumbai to take flights to Jeddah. The Nashik airport has a 3.5km runway that can handle any large passenger or cargo aircraft. Nashik already has air connectivity to cities like New Delhi, Indore, Belagavi, Ahmedabad, Surat and Pune. Alliance Air, a subsidiary of Air India, and two other private airlines are operating flights from the airport. Manish Rawal, the chairperson of the aviation committee of the Ambad Industries and Manufacturers’ Association (AIMA), said this is a positive development. “The footfall of passengers for the domestic flights at the Nashik airport has increased. Making immigration facilities operational will boost international air connectivity as well,” said Rawal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-airport-prepares-infra-to-handle-international-flights/articleshow/87653068.cms||Tushar Pawar

Our teams arrested five accused and recovered one firearm from them,” she said. The crime branch identified the robbers as Navdeep Kumar (25), a resident of Hisar in Haryana, Naseeb (23), a native of Jhajjar in Haryana, Vivek Yadav (20) from Mahendragarh in Haryana, Amit Singh of Churu, Manjeet Singh (21) from Paniyala in Jaipur and Manjit Singh (25), a resident of Paniyala. According to Tomar, one Sunil Soni had plotted the entire conspiracy. He was rounded up and handed over to Vidhyadhar Nagar police station. Police claimed that Soni has several criminal cases against him and had gone to jail for the same. During his spell behind the bars, he struck a rapport with one Sandeep Jat. Sandeep asked Soni to enlist the help of another criminal, Manjit Singh. Together, they plotted a plan to loot and rob several jewellers of the city. Manjit then assembled a group of criminals and outlaws to stage raids on jewellers. Manjit rented a room in the Muhana area to shelter the accused. Crime branch officials claimed that Soni forged Aadhaar cards to procure a mobile SIM for the conspiracy. Prima facie investigation revealed that Soni knew Agarwal and had also taken Rs 50 lakh on loan from the latter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/six-held-for-looting-jeweller-in-vidhyadhar-nagar/articleshow/87655240.cms||---

More than a quarter of Delhi’s 403 petrol pumps located on or near the border in particular have seen a dramatic drop in sales as consumers were drawn to UP and Haryana where petrol became cheaper by more than Rs 8 a litre as the Arvind Kejriwal government is yet to reduce VAT. “About 115 petrol pumps in Delhi are near the border with UP and Haryana. These pumps have seen sales slide 50-60%. The pumps in areas such as trans-Yamuna are suffering more as UP is a bigger draw due to the wider gap with Delhi’s price and larger number of people driving into the city from townships near the capital,” All India Petroleum Dealers Association president Ajay Bansal told TOI. After the Centre cut excise duty on petrol by Rs 5 and diesel by Rs 10 per litre, the UP and Haryana governments reduced VAT to bring down the price of each fuel by Rs 12 a litre. Petrol in UP is now Rs 8.86 per litre cheaper than Delhi against Rs 3.36 a litre earlier. In Haryana, it costs Rs 8.22 a litre less than Delhi compared to Rs 2.43. Diesel, however, still remains cheaper by 8 paise a litre in Delhi than UP against 49 paise earlier; and 39 paise than Haryana compared to 8 paise before. Dealers said they have appealed to the Delhi chief minister to reduce VAT as the loss of sales will also reduce the state’s revenue collection. Sources said the CMO assured them that the government was examining the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vat-cut-on-fuel-in-up-haryana-hits-delhi-sales/articleshow/87654525.cms||Sanjay Dutta

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: All 9 add-on civic poll wards likely in suburbs||Mumbai: With the state government announcing that the number of electoral wards in the city will go up by 9, BMC officials have said that it is likely that the new wards will be added in the suburbs and the number of wards in the island city is unlikely to go up. According to officials, five wards may increase in the western suburbs and four in the eastern suburbs. Officials said that the population of the island city had not gone up while the population of the suburbs had seen a rise. There could however be a readjustment in ward boundaries and population in the island city. The last time that the number of electoral wards was increased in the city was in 2002, when the number of wards went up from 221 to 227. Mumbai is divided into two districts — city and suburban. “The average voters in each electoral ward is now around 54,000. Since the number of seats has increased by 9, the seats will go from 227 to 236. This means that the number of voters in each ward will be close to 51,000 and a 10% here and there. The population of Mumbai is around 1.24 crore. Once we get the orders from the state government, we will rework ward boundaries, keeping in mind the new average voters per ward and redraw the boundaries,” the official added. The total registered voters in Mumbai is 94.55 lakh as per the figures of 2019. Officials said that delimitation or redrawing of ward boundaries is done to balance voter population equally among wards. Officials said that as per the 2011 census, population growth in the suburbs and drop in the island city were taken into account while redrawing electoral wards. Each ward had a population of around 54,000. With a rise in nine seats, the average voting population in each ward will be around 50,000-51,000, according to officials. Election data analyst Hitesh Jain said that many wards in the island city had more than 60,000 population. “The average population should be around 50,000 but several electoral wards like 194, 199 and 198 in central Mumbai have over 60,000 population. There should be uniform population in all 236 wards. A 10% difference is fine but in some wards the population is 20% above or below average,” Jain said. Urban development minister Eknath Shinde had said that between the 2001 and 2011 census, population in BMC limits has increased by 3.87%. “We have begun the GIS mapping to ensure natural boundaries aren’t affected and will do a physical verification where required. This exercise may take around a fortnight,” said an official. Areas like Mulund, Bhandup, Powai, Vikhroli, Kanjurmarg, Andheri (west), Goregaon (west), Malad (west), Borivli-Dahisar are likely to see new wards due to rise in population. Officials said that the need for increase in the number of electoral wards may also be felt as some suburban wards have almost 18 corporators in one administrative ward. Despite the high number of corporators, the population in these wards has exponentially increased.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-all-9-add-on-civic-poll-wards-likely-in-suburbs/articleshow/87655703.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Though the renovation works started years ago are yet to be completed, the district administration decided to open the park so that the children in the city wouldn’t be deprived of recreation facilities any more. The park would be reopened in a simple function to be held on Sunday. “It is a happy news that the park would be opened. The authorities should take steps to reopen the renewable energy park attached to the children’s park,” said Renjith Thampi, an activist. “Earlier, there was a facility for imparting knowledge on traffic rules to the children. The authorities should resume that facility too,” he said. District collector Jafar Malik said that KEL, the contractor, has been asked to complete the renovation works at the earliest. “If we wait for completing the renovation works, children will lose the opportunity for recreation until then. That’s why we decided to reopen the park at the earliest. In the meantime, they can continue with the renovation works,” Malik said. Those associated with the park claim that the pandemic delayed the project. “Their claim is not true. The work should have been completed in May, 2019. It was months after the deadline for completion of the renovation works that the pandemic broke out,” said Ernakulam Vikasana Samithi president K S Dileep Kumar. “As the park remained closed for around four years, a generation of kids lost the opportunity to play in the park. Now, they all are teenagers and can’t use many of the facilities in the park anymore,” Kumar said. The renewable energy park adjacent to the children’s park is in a dilapidated condition. Undergrowth and rusting of toys have made the operations of the renewable energy park difficult. There are many flaws in the works which have already been completed as part of the renovation project of the children’s park. “We will give instructions for clearing the undergrowth in the renewable energy park by Sunday. We have asked the contractors to rectify the flaws in the already completed works,” Malik said. According to the officials with the park, delay in procuring toys from abroad and other parts of the country stands in the way of reopening of the renewable energy park. “The pandemic has caused difficulties in procuring toys. The companies which are to deliver such items face problems in manufacturing and transporting due to the issues stemming out of the Covid-19 pandemic. The train which is to replace the existing dilapidated one in the renewable energy park is expected to reach here within a week. Other items will also be delivered one after another,” an official with the children’s park said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/a-happy-childrens-day-awaits-city-kids/articleshow/87654535.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

The corporation has been conducting fever camps at the venues only after dengue fever clusters were reported. On November 1, Trichy district had reported seven dengue cases and 12 on November 10. Trichy city, Thiruverumbur, Manikandam and Manapparai have been identified as most vulnerable as per the report by the deputy director of health services office. “We are conducting fever camps in 36-38 locations per day in the city to identify cases. Penalties are being levied, the recent rains have aggravated the fever cases. The situation is under control,” a health official with the corporation said. There are 12 active fever clusters in wards 17, 19, 26 and 60 in Srirangam, Ariyamangalam and K Abishekapuram zones. The dengue fever caseload is 10-fold higher than the corresponding period last year, with 3-4 dengue cases being reported every day. Residents across Rockfort, Karumandapam, Palakkarai, Srirangam and Cantonment said that fogging mosquito repellent, an instant solution for mosquito menace, was missing in their respective vicinities even as the civic body promised the drive once in 15 days. “Already a couple of dengue fever cases were reported in our wards, but preventive measures are not visible,”said Vignesh Gunalan, a resident of Rockfort. As the penalisation drive against dengue sources found in houses and commercial places is not active, residents have been lackadaisical in even keeping their properties free from potential dengue source. In public places, coconut shells and plastic containers pose as dengue breeding sources as rainwater accumulates in them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/dengue-cases-on-the-rise-in-trichy-12-fever-clusters-in-city/articleshow/87655256.cms||Deepak Karthik

The inflow in the Koraiyar river has also come down, and the residential areas that were flooded by the river a few days ago expect the situation to improve further, provided there is no heavy rainfall on Friday. According to the PWD, the inflow in the Koraiyar as on Thursday night has come down to 2,000 cusecs. Till Thursday morning, the flow was gauged at 3,000 cusecs. Koraiyar collects surplus water from tanks in Pudukkottai district, and Manapparai, and carries rainwater from its catchment areas. It had flooded the residential neighbourhoods of Trichy city on November 8. Although rainfall is absent in the catchment area, the surplus tanks at Viralimalai and Keeranur are still discharging water into the Koraiyar, which runs towards Trichy city. Koraiyar ends its journey at the PWD aqueduct in Kuzhumayee Amman temple behind Trichy district collectorate. From there it starts its journey as the Kudamurutti river, which travels for six kilometres to merge with the Cauvery. “As there was no heavy rain in the city, the inundation has not worsened. We expect the water level to recede significantly by Friday evening,” a senior official with the PWD said. District collector S Sivarasu and Trichy Corporation officials inspected the inundated areas near Woraiyur. Drainage channels were repaired to discharge stagnant water to an extent in the city. Parts of Lingam Nagar, Kuzhumani, Ramalinga Nagar, Fathima Nagar and Karumandapam were still inundated with the surplus water from the Koraiyar and the Kudamurutti. At Mukkombu (upper anicut), the entire quantum of incoming water from Mettur dam was diverted to the Kollidam river. As the paddy fields in the delta were inundated, PWD said that further discharge of water in the Cauvery will be a disaster. Around 35,000 cusecs of water was discharged into Kollidam at Mukkombu barrage till Thursday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/rain-eases-in-trichy-floodwaters-recede-in-residential-areas/articleshow/87655258.cms||---

Police said that an FIR was registered in the case on Wednesday night after a team of the state child commission discovered the exploitation of young inmates by their seniors which included acts such as physical violence, sexual abuse and misconduct. As per the police, the commission found that as many as eight children had faced ordeal at the shelter. The complaint said that the children were subjected to sexual and physical violence by senior and former inmates. The FIR was filed under Section 377 (unnatural offences) of the IPC and other relevant sections under the protection of children from sexual offences (POCSO) act. “We are also investigating allegations of senior inmates drinking inside the shelter and abusing kids there,” said a senior official, adding that prima facie investigation pointed out gross misconduct inside the shelter. “It has to be probed how former inmates managed to frequently enter the shelter and if they were checked or not,” the official said, adding that more people are under the scanner in the case. Sources said that the commission’s team had also handed over videos saved in a pen drive to the police which purportedly showed ordeals faced by the kids. “The team of child commission had learned about major irregularities inside a private children shelter. They sent a team that discovered all these horrendous acts taking place there. Although the shelter is private, it is registered one and it appears that security was spotty,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sexual-abuse-at-shelter-home-two-minors-detained/articleshow/87655260.cms||---

Goa was earmarked two FTSCs, but the state gave its consent for just one. The consent of states is essential as FTSCs are part of a centrally sponsored scheme where both the Centre and the state chip in with funds. “As the pendency of such cases (that are to be tried in fast-track special courts) is not that much in Goa, the government decided to go in for just one fast-track special court,” Cabral told TOI. “The infrastructure for the court is ready. They now have to appoint a lady judge for the court as per the rules. We have already written to the high court for appointment of the judge.” After the passage of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act in 2018, the central government had decided to set up 1,023 fast track special courts (FTSCs), including 389 to deal exclusively with cases related to violation of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, in 31 states and Union territories. Against the total intended FTSCs, 674 including 367 Posco courts have been made operational in 27 states and UTs, and till August this year they have disposed of 56,267 cases despite the coronavirus-triggered lockdown. The Pocso Act, 2012 enacted by the government of India provides safeguards for children against sexual abuse. The Act provides for establishment of special courts for the purpose of ensuring speedy trial. Further, as per the Act, the evidence of the child shall be recorded within a period of thirty days of the special court taking cognisance of the offence and the special court shall complete the trial, as far as possible, within a period of one year from the date of taking cognisance of the offence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fast-track-court-for-hearing-pocso-cases-ready-cabral/articleshow/87654683.cms||---

A 24-year-old woman from LDA Colony (Kanpur Road) and a 32-year-old man from Phoolbagh in Hussainganj area, have tested positive for Zika. They were asymptomatic with no travel history prior to contracting the virus, which is spread by the dengue-causing Aedes Aegypti mosquito. Samples of four contact persons were taken by health department on Thursday night and anti-larval spray and fogging exercise conducted with the municipal corporation. Soon after Zika outbreak in Kanpur, chief medical officer's (CMO) team in Lucknow district had begun random sampling of fever patients coming to Lokbandhu Raj Narayan Combined Hospital, Balrampur Hospital and SPM Civil hospital. From November 3, more than 250 random samples were sent to King George's Medical University (KGMU) for tests. “Two patients tested positive, but they are asymptomatic. Their samples were collected at Lokbandhu hospital and Civil hospital between November 8 and 9, when they had mild fever,” said, district surveillance officer Dr Milind Vardhan. While the woman patient is in currently isolated in Lucknow, the male patient went to attend a wedding in Ambedkarnagar, before the test result was announced on Thursday. “The health team in Ambedkarnagar has been told to isolate the patient. It’s important to curb movements of Zika patients to avoid virus spread,” said Dr Vardhan. Since there is no specific treatment or vaccine available, only symptomatic treatment is administered, Dr Vardhan appealed to people to remove stagnant water that makes it conducive for mosquitoes to breed. “There is no need to panic since this is not a serious disease. Most are asymptomatic and very few symptomatic patients need hospitalisation. Mortality rate is almost negligible. But the virus is caused by the mosquito, which breeds in clear stagnant water mostly found around homes and gardens. People should regularly drain out stagnant water from coolers, from under the pots and tyres,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/zika-spreads-to-city-2-diagnosed-with-virus-isolated/articleshow/87655704.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Kochi||Ernakulam: The mantra of solving Rubik’s Cubes||KOCHI: If solving Rubik’s Cube was a passion for Sri Hamsika since the age of six, reciting Sanskrit slokas was part of her daily routine since a very young age. And these two habits of the seven-year-old girl from Ernakulam have won her a place in the Kalam Book of World Records and India Book of Records in 2021. The recognition was for performing dual activities simultaneously, as she has solved 15 Rubik’s Cubes while chanting 18 Sanskrit slokas in seven minutes and 12 seconds. Hamsika, who studies in Class II at Bhavan’s Adarsha Vidyalaya in Kakkanad, is the only child of Prince M D, a recruitment consultant in the city, and Radhika Ongole, a homemaker. Her parents said that her passion for slokas started with her listening to her grandmother Subhadra Ongole reciting them at the house. “She started learning the slokas from her grandmother and later studied new ones by watching TV. Rubik’s Cube was bought for her as a toy but slowly she started learning it with much passion. She researched in the internet about solving it and taught herself. Later on, she started studying the solving tricks of other variants of the cube and we bought them for her. Learning from YouTube videos, gradually she increased the speed of solving,” said Radhika. When the family noticed that she could solve the cubes even while chanting slokas, they decided to nurture her skills. Later they applied for the Kalam Book of World Records and India Book of Records and Hamsika set her records. The cubes she solved include, 3 by 3, 2 by 2, 4 by 4, pyramix, skewb, concave cube, rainbow ball, cylinder cube, clock, mirror cube, loppy cube, maple leaf and bead pyramix. “She solved each of the cubes at varying speed during the feat for the records. Now she is trying to improve her speed. She was felicitated at her school for the achievement,” Radhika said. Besides Hindi, English and Malayalam, Hamsika knows Telugu as her mother is a native of Andhra Pradesh. She is also good at drawing and painting and she had won several recognitions. Hamsika, who aims to become a paediatrician, is now working on a mosaic-portrait of former president late A P J Abdul Kalam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/the-mantra-of-solving-rubiks-cubes/articleshow/87654549.cms||---

Drenched in heavy rain, she was shivering when found. The court examined the evidence between October 26 to October 29. After vacation, the court resumed on November 10 and on Thursday, the judgement was announced. “The court took cognizance of the severity of the crime and continued hearing till October 29 midnight. Principal district judge VK Vyas and POCSO court judge PS Kala ensured that the judgement is announced at the earliest,” said Nayan Sukhadwala, district government pleader, Surat. “This is the fastest ever judgment in such a heinous case in the country,” Sukhadwala claimed.  Along with arresting the accused, collection of scientific and medical evidence and recording statements of the concerned persons, police ensured that the forensic investigation was completed in the shortest possible time. Senior police officials including city police police commissioner Ajay Tomar requested top officials of the directorate of forensic science in Gandhinagar to provide early results of various reports. Police got gait analysis and forensic reports of various samples within a short period. “Our team worked hard to ensure that we set an example to prevent such incidents. This is probably the fastest judgement in rape of minor in the country and we will take up each such case on priority,” said Tomar.

---||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: Five held for murder of CPI man at Needamangalam||TIRUVARUR: Special police teams on Thursday arrested five people in connection with the murder of CPI Needamangalam union secretary Nadesa Thamizharvan at Needamangalam town in Tiruvarur district. Thamizharvan, a resident of Olimathi village, was hacked to death by a gang on Wednesday evening, while he was stepping out of his car at Needamangalam bazaar. The arrest comes within 24 hours after the occurrence of the crime. Police identified the accused as R Rajkumar, 33, J Manoj, 23, both natives of Agrahara Poovanur, M Madhavan, 23, of Surakudi Street in Padagacheri, B Sena alias Senapathi, 25, and A Ezhilarasan, 22, both from Thenpathi Street in Araiyur. During the investigation, it came to light that previous enmity between Thamizharvan and prime suspect Rajkumar was the reason for the murder. Rajkumar, a rogue, has criminal cases pending against him at Needamangalam police station. He was in prison in connection with a case and has come out on bail recently, police said. Rajkumar had a scuffle with one of his close relatives of the same village recently. Thamizharvan intervened in the issue and had taken the matter to Needamangalam police in support of the former’s relative. Based on the complaint, police had arrested Rajkumar along with his brother. Angered by the incident, Rajkumar had warned Thamizharvan of dire consequences, police said. Rajkumar came out on bail recently and executed the crime along with his accomplices. Following the incident, relatives and supporters of Thamizharvan damaged the windshields of a government bus and vandalized a few two-wheelers parked at Needamangalam forcing the traders to shut their shops on Wednesday. To avert any untoward incidents, around 800 police personnel have been deployed in and around Needamangaam bazaar since Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/five-held-for-murder-of-cpi-man-at-needamangalam/articleshow/87655259.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Congress high command will decide on cabinet reshuffle: Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot||JAIPUR: Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday said that the Congress high command will decide on cabinet reshuffle in the state. He was responding to the media after the meeting with Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi at 10 Janpath in New Delhi on Thursday. The meeting lasted for almost an hour. A day earlier, Gehlot had met AICC leaders Priyanka Gandhi, KC Venugopal and Ajay Maken in Delhi. After meeting Sonia, Gehlot said, “I have briefed the party's high command about the current situation in Rajasthan. Ajay Maken (state in-charge) knows everything as he keeps coming to the state. Now, the further decision (on cabinet rejig) is left to the high command. Whatever the high command says will be acceptable to all of us. I just want good governance to continue in the state.” He added that Maken would talk to Rahul Gandhi and Congress president and a final decision would be taken by the party high command based on those discussions. The expected cabinet expansion and reshuffle will set the roadmap for 2023 assembly elections in the state. A long brainstorming session was held between Gehlot and the central leadership for two days in Delhi. According to sources, Wednesday’s meeting was regarding the long-pending cabinet reshuffle in the state. “I believe that a lot of confusion has now been cleared and a future roadmap is being prepared,” Maken said. On Thursday in Dausa, Sachin Pilot said the decisions regarding cabinet expansion and other political appointments would be taken soon. The former deputy chief minister said the AICC and the state government were in constant touch over it as the panel that was formed by the party president over a year ago had completed its work. “I met (KC) Venugopal a couple of days ago. We continuously held discussions and soon decisions will be taken with regard to the organisation and the government,” he told reporters in Dausa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cong-high-command-will-decideon-cabinet-reshuffle-cm-gehlot/articleshow/87655274.cms||---

The four fell for an online cheating scam operated by a gang from Alwar in Rajasthan. Rahul Parmar, a software engineer, told police that he got in touch with a woman through an online dating application. Parmar initiated conversation through WhatsApp, but it later turned out that the woman’s profile was a fake one and it was being operated by four men. After initial messages on WhatsApp, Parmar made a video call to the woman. During the video call the woman’s face was covered. Meanwhile, the person on the other side of the call took a screenshot of the video call. Later, Parmar’s face, recorded during the video call, was morphed and used in a pornographic video. The video was then sent to Parmar and he was asked to pay Rs 5,000 through a payment application. Initially, Parmar transferred Rs 2,000 and before he could send the remaining amount, the four accused were arrested by Rajasthan police. Cops identified the four as Farooq Mev, Nahid Mev, Rahis Mev and Samayuddin Mev. “Three other persons have also been cheated by these four accused and we have taken their complaints as well,” said inspector M C Vala of Cybercrime police station. The three other victims are Parimal Lathigra, Ishit Patni and Subhash Ghodasar. “The gang has around 60 members and they used to extort money from people living in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Telangana and Tamil Nadu,” Vala added. Rajkot police will soon be taking the custody of the four accused from Alwar police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/software-engineer-falls-prey-to-online-fraud/articleshow/87653795.cms||---

Among those suspended on Thursday are 15 employees from Aurangabad division, shows official data. Maharashtra transport minister Anil Parab said several MSRTC employees were willing to resume work. “It has come to our notice that a section of agitating employees are stopping the others from rejoining their duties. I have spoken with the top police officials and sought police protection for those, who are willing to resume their work,” he said. Parab once again appealed to the staff to call off the strike considering the larger public interest. The MSRTC employees have struck work since last month demanding merger of the transport utility into the state government among other demands. Meanwhile, local unit of MNS on Thursday held a demonstration in support of agitating MSRTC staff. Stating that stand taken by the government to suspend agitating employees was unjust, MNS leader Ashok Pawar said the ruling party leaders must hold talks with the staff. “Some MSRTC staff have ended their lives in recent past due to financially poor health of the state transportation. The suspension of staff is now rubbing salt on the wounds of affected employees,” he said. Gathered in large numbers in front of the office of Aurangabad collector, MNS workers shouted slogans against the government during their protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/over-2000-msrtc-employees-suspended/articleshow/87653084.cms||---

The gradient here is so steep that it is nothing short of a test especially during peak hours. Looking at the amount of traffic passing through the Naranpura-Chandlodia section, the Railways had proposed a flyover or an underpass at the crossing. However, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation turned down the proposal, claiming that utility lines passing through the area prevented them from doing so. The Ahmedabad-Botad line has been commission through this area, and is expected to be ready by March. AMC officials said, “Utility lines, including drainage pipes, have been laid at the spot which makes building either an underpass or flyover non-feasible. The lines were laid a little above ground level and since roads run parallel to the track, our only option was to build a steep gradient,” said AMC officials. Traffic expert, Amit Khatri, termed the gradient “unsafe”. “It will be tough for commuters when the crossing is closed. The cars will roll back when the driver tries to move ahead. This will increase chances of an accident. People on two-wheelers will also find it hard to balance themselves on such a slope as the vehicle will roll back when stationary. If the vehicle rolls down the slpt, it could hit another vehicle driving past on the parallel road.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/safety-of-commuters-goes-off-track-at-this-crossing/articleshow/87654589.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Nepal to conduct census in Kalapani, may stoke border dispute again||PITHORAGARH: In what may lead to fresh stoking of tensions between India and Nepal, the Nepalese government is gearing up to conduct a census in the Kalapani region of Pithoragarh district over a year after it endorsed a new map that included Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as part of its territory. Nepal’s current census exercise, its 12th, began on November 11 and will end on November 25. Sources told TOI that the census is sought to be conducted in Gunji, Nabi and Kuti villages of Kalapani. They added that Nepal's central bureau of statistics, which is assigned the task, is exploring multiple ways to count population figures since it will not be possible to send teams to visit the villages. “In all likelihood, it will be an indirect census, in which the number of households will be counted using satellite imagery and other technology,” said a source. Another option under consideration is estimating the current population based on India’s census report of 2011. Nepal has no existing census data of the Kalapani region, though the neighbouring country claims that it conducted a survey here in 1961. The India-Nepal border row had sparked off in May last year after Union defence minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated a 74-km road stretching from Ghatiyabagar to Lipulekh Pass. Nepal had lodged a protest, alleging that the road passed through its territory. Subsequently, Nepalese parliament unanimously voted to amend the Constitution to update the country’s map to include the Kalapani as part of its territory. Meanwhile, calling the census exercise in Kalapani region a ‘political gimmick’ by Nepal, Sanam Nabiyal, gram pradhan of Nabi village, said, “The people of Nabi, Gunji and Kuti are Indian citizens and the region is a part of Indian territory. Nepal has no business conducting a census in this area.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/nepal-exploring-ways-to-conduct-census-in-kalapani-region-of-india-may-stoke-border-dispute-again/articleshow/87654571.cms||Prem Punetha

---||Chandigarh||Pros turn cold greens red hot with low scoring at Jeev tourney||Vikram Jit Singh / TNN Chandigarh: The Tricity's golfing fans were expecting defending champion Karandeep S Kochhar to be right on top of the leaderboard but while he disappointed them with a 72 to lie tied-50th, the apex position remained a family reserve. His cousin and Chandigarh lad Abhijit S Chadha, who got married on Sunday to former golf professional and Hero Ladies Tour winner, Ankita Tiwana, shot a blistering 64 to emerge as the joint leader with six-time international winner, Shiv Kapur, after the first round of the Rs 1.5 crore Tata Steel-PGTI Jeev Milkha Invitational at the Chandigarh Golf Club on Thursday. The scoreboard was painted red all over: A record number of 49 players were under-par for the opening round. A 4-under-par 68 could only ensure a top-10 position. Hot on the heels of the joint leaders was another international winner, Rashid Khan, who shot a 65. Khan has won previously at the CGC and narrowly lost a playoff at the Jeev Invitational in 2019 after shooting a record 20-under-par for the CGC. Tournament host Jeev has his task cut out for him: he has to go low on Friday to make it to the money-making weekend rounds as he shot a 75 on Thursday, which included three bogeys from the middle of the fairway as his iron play was not sharp after his long lay-off from the sport. Jeev has been missing the cut consistently on his home greens and were he to make it this time, it would be nothing short of a championship win of sorts for the legendary player! While Kapur was immaculate in his tee-to-green game finding 17 greens in regulation, Chadha was real hot with the putter requiring just 27 putts for the round. These included two monster 30-footers drained on holes 5 and 7. Chadha eagled the par-5 second hole. With such a high-quality field in contention, it is a long road ahead to the final six holes on Sunday. Kapur had shot a 65 at the Jeev Invitational in 2018 during the opening round to hold the joint lead then, too, but did not finish well thereafter. Chadha is eager for a win and is hoping his luck changes with a lady in his life. The long-hitting Chadha last won a championship in 2015. “The challenge over the next three days is going to be reading the greens, which have some mixed grasses and different grains, some patches here and there. The greens were soft and receptive overall, and played to about 9-9.5 on the stimpmeter. I understand that it had been raining late in September and October so course conditions were bound to be affected. The morning conditions are going to be influenced by the cold and dew on the grasses and roughs, while swirling winds high above makes it difficult to read the direction and speed of the breeze correctly,” Kapur told the TOI. “Jeev is like an older brother to me, so I always try my best to play this event. The event means a lot to Jeev after the passing away of his parents earlier this year. We are all here to support him. This tournament would also not be possible without the support of TAKE Sports. They have stood by the professionals even in tough times of COVID and economic turmoil,” added Kapur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pros-turn-cold-greens-red-hot-with-low-scoring-at-jeev-tourney/articleshow/87654574.cms||---
---||Goa||Recruitment process for IPHB caretakers to continue: High court||Panaji: The high court of Bombay at Goa on Wednesday declined to halt the recruitment process of psychiatric patient caretakers at the Institute of Psychiatry and Human Behaviour (IPHB), Bambolim. Advocate general Devidas Pangam informed the high court that the written test is scheduled on November 14 and the petitioners are contract employees. “It will not be proper to halt the recruitment process itself. As such, the applications are liable to be rejected. It is made clear that further recruitment process will be subject to the outcome of the petitions,” the high court stated. Nine psychiatric patient care attendants went to high court seeking quashing of the recruitment rules brought into force on September 23, 2021 and reframing those for the post of psychiatric patient caretaker so that the petitioners are eligible for being considered for appointment. The petitioners stated that the new rules were framed to keep them out of recruitment. The contract employees appointed in 2013 have had their contract of appointments renewed periodically without any break in service. The last contract is renewed on November 11, 2020 and expired on October 31, 2021. There are 28 employees employed on a contract basis to the post of patient care attendants, whose duty includes ensuring safety of patients and staff, assisting in physically controlling the violent and restless patients, maintaining strict vigil on patients and working under direction/instructions of nursing and medical staff. The post of 30 attendants came to be created in 2013 and submitted that the new rules introduced in 2021 are designed to eliminate the petitioners and others similarly placed even from applying for the post of patient care attendants. Advocate Vijay Palekar, representing the petitioners, submitted to the high court that while the 2013 recruitment rules prescribe VIIth pass and knowledge of Konkani as essential and having a good physique as desirable, the 2021 recruitment rules make it essential for one to have passed SSC examination from a recognised board/ institution or successfully completed the course conducted by a recognised industrial training institute. Further, candidates must possess minimum physical standards - male candidates- minimum height of 157 cms, chest unexpanded 80 cms and expanded 85 cms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/recruitment-process-for-iphb-caretakers-to-continue-high-court/articleshow/87654693.cms||---
---||Mumbai||3 Ulhas officials in dock for okay to bldgs while civic boss was on leave in Maharashtra||Ulhasnagar: Three senior officials of Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation have been issued show-cause notices for allegedly granting permission to construct several multi-storey buildings, including a 36-floor high-rise, while the civic chief was on leave earlier this year. The chief has ordered an enquiry. One of the three officials, additional commissioner Karuna Juikar, had been tasked with additional duty of handling ‘important work’ while commissioner Raja Dayanidhi was on leave for nine days in March-April, said civic sources. The sources added that Juikar had given approval for new building projects and also issued a commencement certificate to a part of a multi-storeyed project. “Work for which the The sanctions were given is not classified as ‘urgent work’,” said a source. The action has come after Shiv Sena corporator Bhullar Maharaj and former Sena corporator Vandana Patil complained to the civic chief that Juikar had, in his absence, granted permission for some “non-urgent” work. The former corporator said that Juikar, former town planner Anil Gurgule and junior engineer Parmeshwar Budage had hurriedly sanctioned the plan for the 36-floor high-rise just a day before the civic boss was slated to resume duty. Patil alleged that the sanction was given despite several violations in the project. “For one, the builder had diverted the flow of a nullah and the developer had not submitted the final environment clearance certificate,” said Patil. Maharaj, the other complainant, alleged that the three officials granted permission to the developer to build extra 10 floors despite a high-rise committee’s recommendation for only 26 floors. Gurgule, who retired as town planner, and Budage had in 2010 spent 105 days in jail for granting permission for several buildings in violation of norms. A senior civic official said that Gurgule, in his reply to the show-cause notice, has stated that all permissions given were in keeping with the law and has also declared that there was no financial transaction between the builder and them. Juikar and Budage are still to reply. Juikar refused to comment, saying she is on leave. Dr Dayanidhi too was unavailable for comment. The civic body’s public relations officer, Yuvraj Bhadane, confirmed that the commissioner has issued show-cause notices to the three officers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/3-ulhas-officials-in-dock-for-okay-to-bldgs-while-civic-boss-was-on-leave-in-maharashtra/articleshow/87655755.cms||Pradeep Gupta

More than 2,000 MSRTC staffers have been suspended across the state for participating in the strike. On Thursday, 15 workers from Kolhapur region were suspended. They were posted with the Radhanagari, Chandgad, Gadhinglaj and Ajara depots. Private bus operators demanded that the regional transport office allow their buses to park and pick passengers from MSRTC bus stands. Regional transport officer Deepak Patil said, “The state government has allowed private operators to charge 1.5 times the cost of MSRTC bus ticket. If any operator charges a higher fare, contact regional transport office at 0231-2663131 or send an email to mh09@mahatranscom.in.” There is a heavy police presence at MSRTC bus stands to maintain order and prevent clashes between MSRTC workers and private bus operators. Police have asked the workers to shift their agitation to outside the MSRTC bus stand premises, which the protesters ignored. On Thursday, BJP and a private bus operators’ association from Kolhapur backed the strike. Satishchandra Kamble, head of a private bus operators’ association, said, "The state government is putting pressure on us to give our buses for public transport, but our decision is final – we won't give a single bus. We are in support of the strike. We have demanded to be allowed to enter the bus stand premises, the way it is allowed in Goa and Kerala.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/15-msrtc-staffers-in-kolhapur-suspended-as-stir-continues/articleshow/87653114.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

In Malegaon, over a dozen people were injured, including 10 policemen. Two of the police personnel have been admitted at the hospital for treatment but their condition is stable, said the local police. The police have detained four persons in connection with the incident so far. In Nanded, eight policemen, including an additional superintendent of police, an inspector and six constables were injured. In addition to this, at least three vehicles were damaged in the stone pelting, while a two-wheeler was set on fire. Malegaon police said a large number of bandh supporters were returning after submitting a memorandum to the local administration. When they reached the new bus stand area of the textile town, they saw some shops open and started throwing stones at those outlets. DIG of Nashik Range, BG Shekhar Patil, told TOI that the police had a tough time in bringing the situation under control as the group members had become violent and kept on throwing stones at the policemen. “The police had to resort to mild lathi charge to bring the situation under control. There was tension in the area for about an hour. The situation is now under control,” added Patil. Nashik SP Sachin Patil said the protesters pelted stones at a building with shops at the basement and a hospital on the first and second floor. The stone pelting left some of the window panes of the hospital shattered. The DIG and the SP are camping in Malegaon. Nanded superintendent of police Pramodkumar Shewale told TOI that after giving a memorandum to tehsildar around 3pm, the gathering was dispersing, when some members tried to head towards the district collector’s office by passing through mixed localities but were stopped by policemen and officers. As a result, they started pelting stones, leaving policemen injured. The suspects have been booked at Itwara police station on the charges of attempt to murder, using criminal force to deter government employee from performing official duty, rioting, unlawful assembly. In addition, the suspects have also been charged with sections under the Criminal Amendment Act and Damage to Public Property Act. The injured officers include additional superintendent of police Nilesh More and Itwara police station inspector Sahebrao Narwada, while one constable suffered a fracture in his leg. Additional superintendent of police Vijay Kabade said though none of the policemen suffered any serious injuries, one constable has a fracture in the leg.

Sanjiv More, the sub-divisional officer of Sillod taluka, said private bus operators have been asked to refrain from overcharging the tourists. “The tourists will have to pay the fares similar to MSRTC fares. Any complaint of overcharging will be dealt with strictness,” he said. The private vehicles will offer shuttle services on a 4 km route between Fardapur T-point and Ajanta Caves during the official visiting hours for the tourists. Moushami Kose, the regional manager of the MTDC said that the district administration is planning to operate 4 mini-buses at Ajanta Caves till the end of the MSRTC strike. These buses will replace the fleet of private vehicles pressed into services from Thursday. “Each mini-bus will have a seating capacity of 40 passengers. The arrangement has been discussed during a meeting with the Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan on Thursday,” she said. On Thursday, ToI carried a report highlighting hardships faced by scores of tourists at Ajanta Caves as the shuttle service continued to remain suspended due to the ongoing strike of MSRTC staffers. Listed as one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites, Ajanta Caves have witnessed the footfall of 9,748 tourists (9,675 Indian, 73 foreigners) during Diwali vacations between November 1 to November 8.

---||Goa||Four state hospitals get ‘LaQshya’ tag||Panaji: Goa Medical College & Hospital, Bambolim (GMC) along with Hospicio, Asilo and ID hospital, Ponda have obtained a certification under the Central scheme, Labour Room Quality Initiative (LaQshya) which aims to reduce Caesarean deliveries. A hospital with the certification is required to conduct an audit every month, and from here on every “non-normal” delivery has to be explained to the Union ministry of health and family welfare. The scheme targets to improve quality of care in labour rooms and maternity operation theatres across public health facilities. Also, GMC at regular intervals give updates to the Union ministry about the prevalent C-section rate. Associate professor, department of obstetrics and gynaecology Dr Ajit Nagarsenkar said that the emphasis has been on normal deliveries at GMC, however it is not always possible because it being a tertiary care hospital, it receives a lot of complicated cases referred by other hospitals. “Around 25 to 30% of our cases are referred by other hospitals. GMC’s C-section rate is 35% and it’s high because of difficult cases. However, every attempt is being made to reduce it.” “Obstetrics consultants from the department audit the C-section rate at regular intervals and suggest measures to reduce it. It is examined in which case Caesarean could have been avoided and what alternatives were available. It is not an exercise to penalise anybody, but to examine the options available so that the next time if a similar case is presented, an attempt can be made to avoid a C-section,” Nagarsenkar said. He said that the rate of C-sections began rising across the globe in 1996 and a peak was seen in 2011. Health authorities all over the world, but mainly from the US, intervened when the rate of C-sections started rising at an alarming rate. But reducing C-section will be a tough task as it entails requiring people to change their mindset, Nagarsenkar said. To make a delivery process a little bearable for mothers-to-be, in 2019, GMC introduced a new initiative, wherein a woman admitted to the hospital for a delivery is allowed one attendant in the labour room. The mother-to-be has to declare in advance who will be her attendant in the labour room. It could be her mother, a sister or a relative or any person who could be of help to her. The initiative was kept on hold due to the pandemic. Besides LaQshya, he said, “Suman is another scheme which aims to reduce maternal and infant mortality rates, and this will go a long way in helping bring down C-section rate if not directly, at least indirectly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/four-state-hospitals-get-laqshya-tag/articleshow/87654577.cms||---

In the video, which has gone viral, the man is heard purportedly saying that the family members were told that their patient was alive and put on a ventilator. However, one of them managed to get into the hospital ICU and found that the patient was lying dead with the machines shut. The clip also shows vacant chairs, indicating that no hospital staff was present in the area. Moradabad health department officials said the purported charges levelled in the video shall be probed. Authorities of Moradabad’s Bright Star Hospital have denied the allegations. Mukesh Kumar, chief operating officer (COO) of the private hospital, said, “Two critical patients, who were suffering from dengue, were admitted in the hospital with no pulse rate and no blood pressure. They were already critical and in such cases, survival is almost impossible. Thus, they succumbed to illness. We have been admitting around five to six critical dengue patients in the hospital every day.” The hospital was in the news a few months ago when 15 Covid patients had died within 24 hours, allegedly after the facility ran out of oxygen. Earlier on Tuesday, a ruckus was created at the hospital by the relatives of three dengue patients -- Indrapal (47) of Sambhal, Mini (22) of Katghar, Moradabad, and Usman (60) of Mundha Pandey -- who died within an hour. Their families had accused the hospital of medical negligence. At that time, the hospital authorities claimed that they were “critical”. A new twist was added to the issue when the video went viral on Thursday. Taking cognizance of the purported video, Dr M C Garg, chief medical officer (CMO), Moradabad, said, “The deputy CMO has been directed to take up an inquiry into the matter and provide an audit of the deaths.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/moradabads-pvt-hosp-accused-of-putting-dead-patient-on-ventilator-to-extort-money-from-family-probe-ordered/articleshow/87653805.cms||Maria Khan
---||Kolkata||Cracker ‘stock clearance’, loud music bring noise demon back||Kolkata: Chhath Puja became a Diwali firecracker stock clearance exercise on Thursday morning, defying the apex court order while the attempts of cops to rein in enthusiastic revellers ultimately proved inadequate. Apart from firecrackers, the use of blaring DJ music with every major Chhath procession left environmentalists peeved. The WBPCB officials admitted that crackers were burst indiscriminately across the city, more in south Kolkata and in the southern suburbs than in the north.  In all, 27.7kg banned crackers were seized since Wednesday and 153 people were prosecuted for trying to burst the illegal crackers. Though the apex court had fixed 6am to 8am window for the use of green fireworks on the occasion of Chhath, the bursting of banned chocolate bombs began around 4am. In most places, the crackers were burst in two phases — between 4am and 5.30am when the devotees made their way to the river and water bodies in processions to perform the rituals and again between 7.30am and 10am when the processions returned. The maximum violations were reported from the areas close to various water bodies across the city, both natural and artificial, where many devotees performed the rituals, instead of travelling to the river. Complaints poured in from the residents of Golf Garden, Tangra, Beliaghata, Kasba, Paddapukur, Ballygunge, Mukundapur, Survey Park and Burrabazar. “I had a tough time catching sleep last night. I tried to sandwich my ears with two pillows in vain. I was wondering about the relationship between Chhath and firecrackers. I was recollecting my childhood days when people used to worship the Sun God in a tranquil atmosphere,” said Subhas Datta, a green crusader. Datta observed that it was pointless to blame only the government and police. “Religious sentiments are tricky issues and community leaders must come forward to eliminate such excess from otherwise environment friendly rituals,” he added. Rajesh Sinha, a prominent leader of Bihari Samaj, said, “I have no information of bursting crackers during Chhath. I was there at the ghats of the Ganga and I found the most silent Chhath ever. But if Chhath revellers have burst crackers elsewhere in the city, I am condemning it. Those who burst firecrackers don't understand the significance of the festival. They are bringing a blot in the auspiciousness of Chhath by adding noise.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cracker-stock-clearance-loud-music-bring-noise-demon-back/articleshow/87654595.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Allahabad||Goods train derails in Jaunpur, traffic blocked on Lucknow-Varanasi rail route||Varanasi: At least 14 bogies of a goods train heading towards Varanasi from Lucknow derailed near Shri Krishna Nagar railway station in Jaunpur district at 7.57am on Thursday, blocking train traffic on the Lucknow-Varanasi route via Sultanpur. Hectic efforts were being made to repair the tracks, remove the damaged bodies and restore rail traffic, railway officials told TOI, adding that no injury or casualty was reported in the incident. Blocking of the route led to diversion of nine trains on up and down lines, while one train was short terminated and a passenger train was cancelled, said railway officials. “Following the derailment, several trains including Delhi-Varanasi Mahamana Express were stopped at different railway stations,” said additional divisional railway manager of Northern Railway (Varanasi) Ravi Chaturvedi on Thursday. He added, “DRM NR Lucknow Suresh Kumar Sapra and other senior officials had reached the incident site, where operations for clearing tracks for restoration of train movement had been started.” The goods trains with 59 empty bogies had left for Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Junction’s yard via Sultanpur, Jaunpur and Varanasi. While moving between Udpur Ghatampur and Shri Krishna Nagar railway station in Badlapur area of Jaunpur district, the derailment took place at 7.57am when it was changing track, said the officials, suspecting that the derailment occurred due to damage in railway track. The officials said that the actual cause of the derailment would become clear after proper investigation. As the bogies of this train started colliding with each other while derailing, hundreds of locals gathered near the incident site. The Shri Krishna Nagar station staff immediately alerted the neighbouring stations and senior officials about the incident, after which all trains moving on Lucknow-Sultanpur-Varanasi line were stopped at different railway stations. The Delhi-Varanasi Mahamana Express was also stopped near Sultanpur, the officials said, adding that its passengers were given snacks and the train was diverted on Pratapgarh route to reach Varanasi. Another train, 04264 Varanasi-Sultanpur, was shot terminated while 04263 SLN-BSB was short terminated, said officials adding, 02301 Shramjeevi Express and 045333 Barauni-Ambala Cantt Harihar Express, 04007 Raxaul-Anand Vihar Terminal and 02237 Begampura Express on up line were diverted on Pratapgarh route. Several trains on down line, including festival special trains, were also diverted on Pratapgarh route. Chaturvedi said that the process of removing the derailed bogies from the tracks and restoration of damaged tracks had been started. However, the officials could not confirm when the process of restoration of tracks would be completed to normalise the train movement on Varanasi-Sultan-Lucknow route.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/goods-train-derails-in-jaunpur-traffic-blocked-on-lucknow-varanasi-rail-route/articleshow/87654594.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Work on the Ahmedabad-Udaipur gauge conversion is also being run on war footing and expected to be complete soon. This will open up a new rail route to Delhi from Ahmedabad. Railway officials said that with some parts of the route to Delhi converted to double track the travel time by Ashram Express from Ahmedabad to Delhi has already been cut down by 2 hours and 10 minutes, from earlier 17 hours 30 minutes to the current 15 hours and 20 minutes. With the rest of the ongoing work completed, this time would drop to 14 hours and 30 minutes said a railways official. Currently, the Rajdhani takes 13 hours 35 minutes to reach Delhi from Ahmedabad. That time too will be shortened. Completion of electrification work will reduce the travel time further, said railway officials. “The track is likely to undergo inspection by March next year after which it will be commissioned for passenger traffic,” said a senior railways officer. He said the electrification being tested in Ajmer division will also be commissioned by the middle of next year. About the Ahmedabad-Udaipur-Delhi route, he said that travelling time to Udaipur, which is about 220-odd km will come down to four hours and then another 13 hours to go from Udaipur to Delhi via that route.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ahmedabad-delhi-rly-travel-to-be-much-quicker/articleshow/87654584.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Wake up kid! Play or lose life to obesity, says study||HYDERABAD: Being a couch potato was never good. It becomes decidedly problematic if you start early. That’s just what seems to be happening as a recent multi-city survey revealed that sedentary lifestyle was leading to obesity among children, with nearly 65% suffering from BMI (body mass index) issues. The medicine for these children of the digital age is a bitter one. No screen time for those below three years and only limited screen dose for those above three years is what experts recommend. Jack, surely, has to play, but not digitally. “About 8% girls and 9% boys were found to have high BP. And an average of 65% children have BMI-related issues,” says the study by a Hyderabadbased healthcare start-up ‘Healpha’. The survey screened 64,615 children from 3-18 years in Telangana, AP, TN, Karnataka and Maharashtra. While the study takes into account time before Covid, doctors say obesity and related issues spiked since pandemic. “There has been a rise in obesity cases in the last 18 months in children as young as 2-3 years old, particularly due to unhealthy eating and lack of physical activity. This has also increased diabetes among children aged 3-15. Hypertension seen in children is mostly secondary in nature, being related to renal, heart or hormonal issues,” said Dr Dinesh Kumar Chirla, director of intensive care services at Rainbow Children’s Hospitals. “Obesity is the main reason. Some between 10-15 years have BP of 170. In most cases, parents do not want medication at such a young age. Obesity is a vicious circle. The child often becomes aloof, gets depressed and gets even more hooked to junk food,” said Dr Manabendra Ghosh, a general physician from Tolichowki. Healpha founder Raj Janapareddy says, “Our tests showed that only 0.0018% children are in perfect health. This is alarming. It is a reality check for parents, teachers and government about the status of the future of India — our children.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/wake-up-kid-play-or-obesity-may-hound-your-future/articleshow/87654579.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Teakwood smugglers stab forest chowkidar to death in Sironcha||CHANDRAPUR/NAGPUR: Four bike-borne teakwood smugglers stabbed 47-year-old forest chowkidar, Samaiyya Gora, at Medigatta barrage check post in the early hours of Sunday in Sironcha taluka of Gadchiroli on Maharashtra-Telangana border. He was later declared dead at a hospital at Hyderabad. On the basis of a mobile phone handset seized from the spot, names of notorious teakwood smuggler Nandam Sevyam and his accomplices, Samaiyya Kalawa, Estari Ankayya Madem and Kishtiyya Venkaiyya Madem have come to fore. Forest officials have confirmed involvement of Nandam in teakwood smuggling. Police department has also claimed Nandam’s involvement in smuggling liquor which is banned in Gadchiroli. SP Ankit Goyal said that the police are trying to zero in on the assailants. Range forest officer (RFO), Sironcha, Shrinivas Katku said the Medigatta barrage check post was set up around a month ago to check movement of teakwood smugglers. “Earlier, the smugglers would ferry the woods across the river but they had shifted to surface transport after the Medigatta barrage road was opened,” said a source from Sironcha. There have been several skirmish between forest teams and teakwood smugglers at the state border in the past, but it is for the first time someone from the forest department has been killed. Around a couple of months ago, an officer of the ranks of assistant police inspector from Telangana, now working in state criminal investigation department (CID), was found allegedly involved in teakwood smuggling. It’s learnt , he had fled after threatening the forest guards with firearms. Gora had earned good reputation due to his work. The four assailants, identified as habitual teakwood smugglers, approached Gora while he was talking to someone over the cellphone. The assailants inquired whether he was Samaiyya. As soon as he replied in affirmative, one of the smugglers got down from the bike and stabbed him. Leaving a profusely bleeding Gora, the smugglers fled the spot. RFO Kaktu said Gora was rushed to Sironcha rural hospital from where he was referred to Hyderabad. “We have raised this check post couple of months ago to curb teakwood smuggling to neighbouring Telangana. The move blocked the key smuggling route of teakwood and fellers in the area are fuming over it,” said Katku. The RFO said the forest department has borne the expenses of treatment and have given ex-gratia aid to his family for funeral. “However, there is no provision of providing any kind of compensation to daily wage workers even if they died on duty,” said Katku. “We will try help his (Gora) family through personal contributions,” said the RFO. IFS officer Praveen Angusamy has tweeted about Sammaiya’s death giving a call for raising financial aid for his family through government or NGOs. While many vented their ire over norms that don’t provide for compensation to non-permanent staff, a few have offered to gather through crowdfunding. Meanwhile, Asaralli police have registered an offence of murder and launched a manhunt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/teakwood-smugglers-stab-forest-chowkidar-to-death-in-sironcha/articleshow/87655296.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

According to the copies of the minutes of the meeting accessed by TOI, the agenda of the meeting was to review the Parambikkulam-Aliyar agreement, Pandiyar-Punnapuzha scheme, Mullaperiyar dam and other allied interstate matters. In the meeting, responding to Tamil Nadu’s request for permission to cut the trees in the downstream of the baby dam, and repair the Ghat road, the principal secretary, forests and wildlife, Kerala informed him that the approvals are being processed. T K Jose, additional chief secretary, water resources department, expressed concern about the safety of the dam and stated that a new dam is the only solution to address the fears and concerns of the people living downstream of the existing dam. In response, the additional chief secretary, PWD, Tamil Nadu pointed out that the state is working within the ambit of the Supreme Court’s judgment and that the concerns of the people needs to be addressed. Besides, Jose, Rajesh Kumar Sinha, principal secretary forest and wildlife department, too had attended the meeting, along with other officials, conducted via video conference. In his letter, the chief wildlife warden has stated that the permission to cut the trees was issued after detailed discussions were held with the water resources department. "On 1-11-2021, principal secretary, F&WLD and wildlife warden met ACS, water resources department in his chamber and discussed the matter. ACS water resources department reiterated the necessity of granting tree felling permissions without any more delay, so that the present case in the SC could be defended properly,” said the letter. “...It is submitted that the permission for felling of 15 trees from approximately 40 cents of lease land area has been granted also based on the discussions at the level of ACS, water resources department and considering the stringent directions in the judgments of the SC and the ongoing hearings happening in the matter in the Supreme Court," said the letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/meeting-minutes-belie-govt-claim/articleshow/87654601.cms||Sandeep Thomas

Those privy to the action maintained that the premises belonging to a leading builder and others belonging to an industrialist in Aurangabad were searched. Sources said that the industrialist has multiple business interests ranging from construction, agriculture and sugar industry. The ED teams and the income tax department teams caught the staff at the locations by surprise. One of the staff member, who was allowed to step out of the office, said, “ED officials have seized mobile phones, laptops, computers and several files from the office and were screening them.” Sources have cited BJP’s Kirit Somaiya recent statement indicating about alleged money laundering in Marathwada region. Somaiya had also stated about lodging a complaint in this regard. Those privy to the searches claimed that it could be related to a Jalna sugar factory, which was purchased by the builder. The builder sold off his shares from the sugar factory to an industrialist. A complaint in this regard was lodged with the ED, which initiated a probe for money laundering and issued notices to the builder as well as the industrialist. “ED has been probing the two for money laundering for quite a while. On demand of ED, several sets of documents showing sugar factory related monetary transactions were submitted in the past few days,” said an employee of the builder. Along with this, separate ED teams were conducting searches in Maharashtra in connection with a money laundering case linked to alleged illegal sale of Waqf properties, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/ed-searches-at-multiple-locations-in-aurangabad/articleshow/87653138.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The panchayat has set December 31 at the deadline to make the panchayat clean and green, said sarpanch Girish Pillai. “Ours is second richest panchayat in the state, but the condition of the village is pathetic mainly because of garbage mismanagement. When I was the sarpanch previously, I had made attempts of solving the issue, but as the no-confidence was passed against me, and due to the pandemic, no work could be carried out.” After having meetings with villagers and environmental lovers, Pillai said that they learnt that garbage collection facility needs to improve as the contractor was not doing his job properly. Pillai requested the villagers to support the panchayat in its initiative and segregate the garbage at source before giving it to the garbage collectors. Pillai has asked the new contractor to clear the black spots in the panchayat jurisdiction. “The next big challenge is preventing people from dumping garbage and construction waste on the open. Such people will be dealt with strictly and action will be taken,” the sarpanch said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sancoale-panchayat-working-for-garbage-free-status-by-dec-31/articleshow/87654697.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A delegation from the National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) Goa, along with final year engineering students, met with the officiating registrar of the university, M Sreedharan, requesting that the pending results be declared by November 15. Questioning GU officials about the three month delay, NSUI-Goa president Naushad Chowdhari said students are left in a limbo due to it. “Engineering exams were concluded on August 16 and it has been almost three months, but the results are still pending.” Chowdhari said that as per rules and regulations of the university, results should be declared within eight weeks after the examinations. “Here the university is clearly violating its own rule of the ordinance which clearly indicates the pathetic situation GU is going through. It is sad that there is no one to address the students’ issue,” he said . NSUI further pointed out that the controller of examinations (CoE) is on leave, the registrar has not taken official charge yet and that there is no assistant registrar for professional courses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gu-must-pay-penalty-for-results-delay/articleshow/87654604.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Rs 35 lakh monthly bill for penguin exhibit upkeep||MUMBAI: With the BMC administration reviewing the Rs 15 crore tenders for maintenance of Byculla zoo’s penguin enclosure following sopposition from corporators, BMC has called for monthly tenders for penguin enclosure maintenance. It has floated a tender worth Rs 35 lakh to maintain the penguin enclosure for a month. Officials said the earlier maintenance contract had expired and BMC was awarding a monthly contract as the three-year tender was delayed after opposition corporators objected. The three-year tender is under administrative scrutiny. BMC will have to shell out around Rs 5 crore a year for three years to maintain the penguin enclosure. BMC had floated a tender of around Rs 15 crore for upkeep of penguins for three years. “The new tender is under process. The current contract for three years started in September 2018. This was a Rs 11.5 crore contract. The money will be spent on maintenance and air-conditioning of the penguin enclosure, life support and electrical system. It will also cover cost of veterinary staffers and supply of fish food for penguins,” the official said. The footfall of visitors at Byculla zoo rose around 30% after opening of penguin exhibit in March 2017 but income rose close to 500% as BMC hiked ticket prices that year. BMC claimed income at the zoo rose due to the penguins. BMC’s data stated there were 12.51 lakh visitors in 2015-16 and the zoo earned Rs 70.03 lakh in ticket sales. In 2017-2018, visitors were 17.57 lakh and income Rs 4.36 crore. In 2018-19, visitors fell to 12.70 lakh but income was Rs 5.42 crore. In 2019-20, there were 10.66 lakh visitors but the zoo earned Rs 4.57 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rs-35l-monthly-bill-for-penguin-exhibit-upkeep/articleshow/87655762.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

State’s special counsel A Santhosh Kumar conveyed this to a bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A Rajasheker Reddy which was hearing a PIL filed by Congress leader Dasoju Sravan Kumar. The petitioner alleged the state government had been suppressing Covid-19 death figures. “The real figures would be much more than figures being shown by state,” he said. He sought a direction to the state to form the deaths audit committee immediately. “The kin of the deceased would become eligible to receive ex gratia of Rs 50,000 if the death is declared as one connected to Covid-19 infection,” he said. The state counsel furnished to court two GOs issued by the state on November 8 and 9, 2021. “We have formed the audit committee and GO No. 151 (dated November 8) and GO No. 1 (dated Nov 9) were issued notifying the same,” Santhosh said. He sought four weeks to file a counter. However, the petitioner’s counsel said GOs were not in tune with Centre’s guidelines. The bench said it was giving time to state to file its counter. It posted case to January 31, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-deaths-audit-panel-formed-t-to-hc/articleshow/87654599.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Kolkata||Kolkata traffic police to use disposable straws in breathalyzers||KOLKATA: Concerned over possible objections raised by motorists to undergo drink-driving tests, the Kolkata traffic police have issued a standard operating procedure (SOP) to all 25 traffic guards with details on how to carry out these tests. At the same time, Lalbazar has clarified that breathalyzer tests will be conducted only on motorists. Cops have been instructed to seize the vehicles if drivers and bikers are found drunk. TOI had reported on Tuesday and Wednesday about the return of breathalyzers after similar decisions were taken in Delhi and Chennai. According to the latest NCRB report of 2020, Kolkata, Delhi and Chennai have witnessed the maximum number of drink-driving accidents in the country. “Please resume breathalyzer tests to detect drink-driving. Only disposable (sealed and packed) straws will be used for conducting the tests. These straws will be disposed of in closed containers while the breathalyzer machines will be washed with sanitisers after use. OCs and additional OCs will personally ensure compliance with the instructions,” stated the order issued by DC (traffic), Arijit Sinha. “We are concerned about the spurt in drink-driving cases this winter. We had recorded 230 cases between October 1 and November 7. In the last two days (there was no checking on the day of Chhath), we have come across 29 cases. However, we are taking all precautions to stem the spread of Covid-19 while carrying out the tests,” said an officer. A sergeant from the traffic guard of an added area said, “Earlier, anyone could be asked to blow through the breathalyzer on the basis of a suspicion. But now it has been verbally communicated across the traffic guards that only those, who appear to be intoxicated, should be subjected to the test so that the number of people using the machine will be less.” Cops usually carry multiple pipes that are changed every time a person is tested, but as the number of tests goes up on weekends, the pipes were often washed for re-use in the pre-Covid period. “This has been banned forever,” said an officer. A new device was introduced in the beginning of last year that allows one to blow from a distance of around 5cm, instead of getting a pipe inside the mouth of an offender, said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-to-use-disposable-straws-in-breathalyzers/articleshow/87654614.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Ahmedabad||Railway line may derail traffic in Ahmedabad’s west||AHMEDABAD: The metre gauge line connecting the city to Botad is likely to derail the schedule of commuters using roads in the western parts of Ahmedabad, such as Navrangpura, Vijay Crossroads, and Naranpura. The rail line cuts through the city’s west. The railways is conducting trial runs and plans to commission the track by March 2022. The AMC has not made any provision for underpasses or overbridges to mitigate the effects of the track. Hence, traffic snarls are expected at the crossroads near the Navrangpura police station and other sites. Divisional railway manager, Bhavnagar, Manoj Goyal said that the inspection of the Ahmedabad-Botad track has been completed and the division is waiting to run a goods train on this section first. After the successful operation of the goods trains for 1.5 months, the railways will operate passenger trains on this track. “We expect permission to run the goods train shortly,” Goyal said. The newly laid Ahmedabad-Botad line passes through Naranpura, Navrangpura, Paldi, and Sarkhej among other places. A senior officer in the traffic consultative committee said that there are about 10 major crossings between the Sabarmati junction and Sarkhej. The officer said that traffic jams are likely at these spots. Before commencing work on the line in 2018-19, the railways had informed the AMC. The intimation was given so that the civic body could create underpasses and overbridges to deal with the anticipated traffic problems. The Ahmedabad-Botad line is further connected to Bhavnagar via Dhola. At present, the Bhavnagar-Bandra train takes the Bhavnagar-Dhola-Botad-Limbdi-Ahmedabad route. The 298km distance between Bhavnagar and Ahmedabad was covered in 5 hours and 50 minutes on the old route. The new route will cut the distance by at least 35km. A senior railway officer said that at least five mail and express trains and an equal number of goods trains are likely to pass through the city using the new track. This will mean that each crossing will be closed for nearly 10 minutes. “There could be more traffic jams than before at the railway crossings in the city. In all, there are 32 level crossings, big and small, along the Ahmedabad-Sarkhej route with no fewer than 16 between Sabarmati and Gandhigram railway stations,” the officer said. “Increased activity on this track will necessitate the stoppage of the city’s vehicular traffic more frequently.” The officer added: “Earlier, when citizens raised their voice against traffic jams, it was decided to terminate all metre gauge trains at the Gandhigram station instead of the Kalupur station.” Officials said that, in fact, goods trains from Bhavnagar will also be diverted to this line, which might take the total number of trains passing on the Ahmedabad-Botad track up to 12. Rajesh Shah, a resident of Navrangpura, said major problems are afoot. He said that in his area, one lane comes in from Mithakhali and another from the Navrangpura bus stand, forming a T-junction which is a traffic bottleneck. Shah said that road dividers may alleviate the problem. Ankit Patel, an Amdavadi who frequently uses this stretch, said that vehicles coming from Mithakhali and heading to Ashram Road contribute to the snarls. He said a one-way road in this section could ease the jams. He said commuters could take the road to the Navrangpura bus station to reach the Navrangpura police station. This will help the AMC smoothen the traffic on this junction, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rly-line-may-derail-traffic-in-citys-west/articleshow/87654624.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

According to forest officials, Mangat Singh, son of a farmer, had moved closer to the herd while taking their pictures when a tusker attacked him, killing him on the spot in Dalrajpur village of Nighasan area. This is the second incident within a month when a human was killed by a wild elephant. On October 11, a wild elephant had killed a youth while he was attempting to take a selfie with pachyderms in the Mohammadi range of the DTR. Officials said the herd had been camping in Dalrajpur and its neighbouring village Taparpurva since Monday and had destroyed standing sugarcane crop and banana trees in several acres. Meanwhile, a video has surfaced, showing an unidentified person opened fire at a tusker that had a narrow escape. The jumbo, however, went berserk, uprooting an electric pole and destroying sugarcane crop. Officials claimed that the video was shot before the tusker killed the youth. Deputy director, DTR (buffer), Anil Patel told TOI that they had sent a team to the village to monitor the situation. “We are trying to shoo away the herd into the wild. Besides, we will also investigate whether the bullet was fired in the air or aimed at the elephant.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/boy-17-trampled-to-death-by-wild-elephant-while-taking-pics-of-herd-on-mobile-phone-near-dtr/articleshow/87653832.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Officials said they can directly check if a water bottle has a fake ISI mark or not. “In the recent case, an official casually checked licence number on the BISCare app to see if the bottle was genuine or not and found that no such number existed,” said KV Rao, scientist and head, BIS Hyderabad branch. Rao added, “While we usually get tips off about such illegal activity from competitors, in interior areas such plants might go unnoticed. We request people to use BISCare app. They should lodge complaints in case a fake ISI mark is being used. This will avert major healthcare threats.” Manufacture, sale, storage and exhibition of packaged drinking water without valid BIS licence, use of BIS mark (ISI) without a valid licence are punishable under BIS Act 2016. “BIS licence is given to the manufacturing units only after thorough scrutiny of their manufacturing and testing facilities, and also hygienic conditions to be followed during its manufacture. Since maintenance of cleanliness and other aspects is a costly affair, most of the spurious manufacturing units do not seek licence,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bis-officials-to-raid-more-bottling-plants-soon/articleshow/87654612.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Pricier construction material, labour may push up realty rates||KOLKATA: Prices of apartments in Kolkata may go up by Rs 350-Rs 400 per sq ft, real estate developers said on Thursday, citing a sharp rise in the cost of construction materials and labour in the past year that had eroded margins. “Construction cost has gone up by 12% in the past 12 months while labour cost has increased by nearly 12%. The increase in fuel price has added to the material transportation cost. This has impacted our profitability as there is no escalation clause in the sale agreements. There is a need to review our selling prices to ensure that the business remains viable and companies stay healthy,” said Credai West Bengal president Sushil Mohta. In the past six months, several developers have already increased prices by Rs 175- Rs 200 per sq ft. A further hike will see the price escalating by Rs 525-Rs 600 per sq ft in less than two years. Though developers have been grumbling about rising costs, they have not been able to increase prices, fearing a slackening of demand in a depressed market. It is only in the past four months that demand has picked up, driven largely by the budgetary incentive of 2% reduction in stamp duty and 10% slash in circle rates announced by the state government. This appears to have given developers the confidence to talk about increasing prices. Credai Bengal president Nandu Belani said the price hike would only provide a much-needed breather to developers who have been battling multiple issues for the past several years, including migration to GST and Covid. “Unless something is done to reduce the input costs, price rise is inevitable. Project launches have been delayed due to this as developers don't want to incur more losses. In major material costs, we’ve seen a 45% increase in reinforced steel and 12% increase in ready mix concrete (RMC). That translates into an impact of Rs 122.8per sq ft on account of steel and Rs 41.2on account of RMC,” said Belani.  “The price of PVC that is used for plumbing has increased by 30-40%. Then there is a 10% rise in the cost of other metals and a 60% rise in the cost of sand. In addition, there is a huge increase in transportation cost due to fuel price hike. While plumbing material comes from Delhi, tiles and floors come from Gujarat and Rajasthan,” Belani added. While the average price rise is expected to be in the range of 10-12%, the affordable housing category will take the worst hit as construction cost is the highest component in this category of apartments unlike the premium of luxury units where cost of land is more than construction. “Projects that are launched henceforth and units in existing projects that are unsold will see prices rise in 2022,” said Siddharth Pansari, executive committee member at Credai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pricier-construction-material-labour-may-push-up-realty-rates/articleshow/87654635.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The incident was recorded on a CCTV camera. The boy, whose right hand is amputated, sells fish with his father to support his family. He alleged that the two policemen asked him to do some “illegal” work but he refused, which is why he was thrashed. The constables have been identified as Satyendra Singh and Naveen Malik. The incident took place in Bareilly’s Bithri Chainpur area on Wednesday evening. His father is yet to lodge a complaint with police. In the video, the two policemen were seen stopping the boy and later, one of them began kicking him while the other started hitting him with a baton. The boy was subsequently admitted to a community health centre. He claimed that the policemen first approached him and said he was “illegally selling fish”. Then, they told him to do some “illegal work” for them, for which they offered him “a share”. “I don’t know what illegal work they were talking about but I immediately refused.” SSP Sajwan told TOI, “The two constables had an argument with the boy over some issue and later retaliated by thrashing him. We will take appropriate action as the circle officer will investigate the matter and find out what exactly happened on that day. The boy has been admitted to hospital and he doesn’t have any serious injury. His family is satisfied with our action.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/moradabad-boy-14-with-amputated-limb-refuses-to-do-illegal-work-for-cops-thrashed/articleshow/87653840.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Hyderabad||Stop taking beyond your share in APIDC, says Telangana high court to Andhra Pradesh||HYDERABAD: The Telangana HC has asked AP government not to withdraw money from joint account of Andhra Pradesh Industrial Development Corporation Limited (APIDC) beyond its entitlement. A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A Rajasheker Reddy said this while hearing a petition filed by Telangana State Industrial Development Corporation (TSIDC) charging AP with withdrawing more money than its entitlement. Telangana special counsel A Sanjiv Kumar said AP had taken advantage of the fact that the common accounts were still lying in the name of APIDC and had withdrawn Rs 70 crore so far. “This is Rs 6 crore more than its share,” he said. AP counsel informed the court that both states could withdraw money in the ratio of 58:42 from the common account. Both the advocates brought to the notice of the court the judgment delivered by the Supreme Court in the AP State Higher Education Council versus Union of India case wherein the apex court directed the twin states to share the common corpus fund in institutions that were not yet completely divided in the ratio of 58:42. AP claimed that it did not withdraw money beyond its share. Sanjiv charged AP with diverting fixed deposits money into the current account and withdrawing cash from there. “We have already lost more than Rs 6 crore from the common corpus fund of the corporation and any delay in restraining AP would result in more loss to us,” he said. AP advocate general S Sriram, however, denied this allegation and said that their withdrawal was very much within the share they were entitled to. The case was posted to January 3, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/stop-taking-beyond-yourshare-in-apidc-hc-to-ap/articleshow/87654640.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

Putting forward his case before Justice Shameem Akther, senior counsel T Niranjan Reddy said that Vadarevu and Nizampatnam Industrial Corridor Project is a viable project. It would have converted the region into an economic hub by now had the project been allowed to come up, he said. A PIL was filed against YS Jagan Mohan Reddy in the high court seeking a CBI probe against him and his assets. The high court had ordered a probe with a rider that none of the genuine investors should be harassed, the counsel said. But the CBI did precisely that and implicated Nimmagadda Prasad in the case without explaining why it chose to make him an accused ignoring the HC directive. “CBI charged us with conniving with bureaucrats and misleading the cabinet,” he said, adding that this was an irrational allegation because the project was planned as a government to government project and an MoU was signed between AP and Ras Al Khaima, one of the seven emirates of the UAE, he said. State did not suffer financial loss in case because it did not invest anything in project, he said. Hearing in the case would be resumed on November 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nimmagadda-seeks-relief-in-cbi-case/articleshow/87654659.cms||---

The villagers were crossing the river in a boat to harvest sugarcane. Several villagers who witnessed the scene and knew swimming, saved the villagers from drowning. Meanwhile, police teams also arrived and two people were taken to hospital. The injured were identified as Omprakash (50) from Rajarampur and Radha Kumari (18) from Daibalgarh. They are recovering and said to be out of danger. Anil Kumar from Chahadwala village, who was part of this risky journey, told TOI "We have to cross Ganga every day to fetch our crop and fodder for cattle. On Thursday morning, we were travelling in a boat. When we reached the middle of the river, swift water rocked our boat. The current was so swift, we almost started drowning. Some of us were good at swimming and villagers also reached the spot. All of us were rescued timely.” Talking to TOI, Bijnor superintendent of police Dharamveer Singh said, "All villagers were rescued. Fortunately, there was no casualty." According to villagers, after long agitation by villagers from 25 villages, a pontoon bridge was erected on Ganga for fetching crops across the river. It was opened by the irrigation department in monsoon season. Sugarcane crushing season is set in but a bridge has not been erected as of now. Villagers are compelled to take boats to haul their crop from khadar areas. Notably, on August 24, 2018, due to the lack of a bridge, a boat was submerged in the Ganges leading to the death of ten women. On being contacted, Bijnor Tahsildar said, "The bridge is erected here by the irrigation department. This time the bridge was not erected due to high-water level in Ganges following unseasonal rain in October. We are trying our best to resolve the problem."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/boat-capsizes-in-ganga-all-rescued/articleshow/87653857.cms||Harveer Dabas

Vyas’s body was never found. Both the accused, Khushi Sahjwani (46) and Siddesh Tamhankar (42), pleaded not guilty, paving the way for the trial to commence against them. The maximum punishment attracted in the case is the death sentence. Vyas, a resident of Grant Road who worked for BBlunt Salon in Andheri, went missing on March 16, 2018. The alleged couple was arrested in connection with the murder on May 5, 2018. A police inquiry unearthed that the duo allegedly dumped her body at Mahul. A prolonged search for the body did not yield results. While Sahjwani, mother to a teenage son, was granted bail by the Supreme Court on July 2 this year, Tamhankar is still in jail. His repeated pleas for bail have been rejected by the court. While granting Sahjwani bail, the apex court had said, “Considering the fact that the petitioner is a female undertrial prisoner, who has been in custody for more than three years...and considering the family situation of the petitioner, the petitioner is directed to be released on bail...” The court also noted the chargesheet was submitted in July 2018. During Thursday’s proceedings before the sessions court, the duo initially refused to sign their respective pleas. Later, Sahjwani filed an application through her advocate Wahab Khan stating she be permitted to sign the plea with an undertaking that she would cooperate for the smooth and day-to-day progress of the trial. The court allowed her plea. The court said since Tamhankar has been in jail for over three years, the prosecution should take every step to begin the trial and examine witnesses as early as possible. It adjourned the matter to Friday. The chargesheet said Vyas was killed as the duo feared she would blow the lid off their illicit relationship. It was further alleged Tamhankar, a Parel resident, was also afraid he would lose his job as Vyas had given him a memo and March 16, the day she went missing, was the last day of the notice. Cops submitted forensic reports and said circumstantial evidence supported their theory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-years-on-charges-framed-against-murdered-salon-execs-2-colleagues/articleshow/87655771.cms||Rebecca Samervel

A higher figure for second dose due indicates that more number of people have been partially vaccinated in that particular district. Amravati division has over 40 lakh unvaccinated eligible people as compared to Nagpur’s 17 lakh. Amravati district alone has 10 lakh eligible persons who are yet to take their first dose. At 5.83lakh, Nagpur district has highest number of beneficiaries who are due for second dose. Yavatmal district under Amravati division has the highest number of beneficiaries at 2.4 lakh who are yet to take their second dose. After the central and state governments pulled up local administrations, Amravati divisional commissioner Piyush Singh has instructed each district to achieve a daily target. Districts under Nagpur division have taken their own unique decisions to ramp up the figures. The measures have to a certain extent yielded good results with daily vaccination in Vidarbha crossing 1 lakh mark on Wednesday and Thursday. Ahead of Diwali festival, the daily vaccination had dropped to under 10,000 in the region. All districts have been asked to complete at least first dose of eligible person by November 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/23-57l-due-for-second-dose-in-vidarbha-may-take-40-days-to-be-jabbed/articleshow/87655335.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Coimbatore||Coir pith industries get pollutingtag, come under strict norms||Coimbatore: The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) has shifted coir pith units to orange from the white category, forcing the units to follow stricter pollution control norms to curb water and air pollution.Industries are colour-coded - red, orange, green and white - based on their pollution emission levels, with white being the least polluting category.The order to bring the units under orange category was issued on Wednesday. The units should use only closed shed and impervious platform to store, process and clean pith to avoid polluting groundwater. Sun drying cannot be done directly on land and instead, cement platforms should be used. Mechanical drying options should be explored. Wastewater generated from the units should be recycled using effluent treatment plants to meet the quality prescribed by the board. The treated water should be recycled. To mitigate dust emission, the unit should install windnet arrestors along the boundary. Green belt should be set up to control dust emission. The units should adhere to the ambient air quality/emission standards prescribed by the board.While environmentalists and farmers owning lands adjacent to coir pith units welcomed the decision, it did not go well with the owners of the units. “The decision will also affect coconut farmers, who get Rs 2 to Rs 2.50 for every coconut husk. If the industry doesn’t do well, the farmers stand losing the income,” owner of a unit said.Malaipalayam-based farmer A Thiyagarajan welcomed the order. “It was a long-pending demand. We thank the chief minister and environment minister who solved the issue for the benefit of farmers,” he said.Coir Board member S K Gowthaman said that coir pith industries cannot survive if strict regulations are implemented. He appealed to the CM not to implement the guidelines. “The regulations will affect industries in Tamil Nadu and benefit industries in neighbouring states,” he added.There are over 7,000 coir pith units in the state and 2,000 in Coimbatore, thanks to widespread coconut cultivation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/coir-pith-industries-get-pollutingtag-come-under-strict-norms/articleshow/87655330.cms||V Devanathan

For months they watched a popular TV serial on crime and rehearsed the jargon and body language of actors enacting the role of detectives. No wonder their 'raids' faced little resistance from an indefinite number of medical store owners they extorted in lieu of 'turning a blind eye.' But a raid on Baghpat based medical store proved to be their undoing when police were informed. All five in the age-group of 30-35 were arrested. Elaborating upon the modus operandi, investigation officer Yogesh Giri said, "Medical stores were an easy target for them. They would send a decoy customer who asked for a banned oxytocin injection illegally used to increase milk production among cattle. Any store that stocked it would be raided." "Ankush Singh and Anil Kumar from Ghaziabad, Yameen Khan from Delhi and two other women were part of the scam. We have recovered three CID IDs, Rs 35k and a walkie talkie from them. It has come to light they had been blackmailing medical owners in many districts of West UP", said Neeraj Jadaun SP Baghpat. Revealing further details investigation officer Giri said, "Some of the cases that have come to light are extortion of Rs 85k from a medical store in Shamli, Rs 2 lakh from Loni in Ghaziabad, Rs 50k from another store in Ghaziabad Rs 1 lakh from GTB Nagar in Delhi, Rs 2 lakh from Balaini in Baghpat and latest Rs 35k from a medical store in Khekhra whose owner informed the police." According to sources the five have been booked under IPC sections 420 (cheating), 471 (forgery), 384 (extortion), etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/five-cid-sleuths-extort-lakhs-from-medical-store-owners/articleshow/87653880.cms||Sandeep Rai

In her police complaint, Neha Prashar, chief manager, SBI, said that a person identified as Gulab Singh, who worked as clerk-cum-cashier at the treasury branch of Chandimandir bank branch, took a loan of Rs 1.50 lakh on March 21, 1996, of 240 installments of Rs 835 each. The bank official stated that Gulab Singh again applied for a bank loan of Rs 90,000 on July 9, 1996, which was to be paid in 180 installments of Rs 1,500 each. The loans were given by the bank on the 10 Marla land he owned. However, Gulab Singh did not pay installments regularly. Despite various notices, he failed to pay the loan amount.

Experts suggest that a system must be in place to limit paddy production to water-stagnant areas. There is no such data at the moment. However, it is believed that approximately 20 lakh acres is suitable only for paddy cultivation in the state. “It is not easy to start converting the land for cultivation of non-paddy crops where paddy has been grown for more than five to ten years,” Kanneganti Ravi of Rythu Swarajya Vedika said. It will take at least two or three years for land parcels to do better soil management which needs some investment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-system-tolimit-paddyproduction/articleshow/87654681.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Rathod was the handler of accused Jollu Naveen. When Rathod was asked who took the decision to not handcuff despite the accused being taken out of the guest house to an open field in pitch dark at 3.30am, the cop named investigating officer (IO) and Shadnagar ACP V Surender and said he did not give any order. Rathod said that the articles of Disha were under the soil, with a stone and stick placed on top. The constable also stated that none of the cops told Arif to dig after he pointed out the spot in the field at Chattanpally on December 6, 2019. The escape attempt was allegedly put in motion by Arif, who was the first to attack, according to cops. The constable further said that he was holding Jollu Naveen’s left hand and the accused threw soil with his right into his eyes. “Naveen also threw stones at me and I dodged them. One of them hit SI Venkateshwarulu. I rubbed the hand of the SI, who was bleeding from forehead, as that was the only first-aid I knew. I did not give any first-aid to the other injured cop, Aravindh Goud,” Rathod said. Quizzed about why his statement to the encounter case IO J Surender Reddy was silent on finding the articles on the fifth bund, while the same was mentioned in his affidavit furnished before the commission, Rathod said, “I had told him. He did not reduce my statement into writing in my presence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/accused-were-not-handcuffed-as-io-did-not-give-any-order-cop/articleshow/87654677.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Coimbatore||Kinathukadavu farmers upbeat as water released to Kothavadi lake||COIMBATORE: Farmers of Kothavadi in Kinathukadavu taluk and nearby villages are upbeat as water has been released to Kothavadi lake after three years. Water from Thirumoorthy hill used to feed the lake, which has shrunk and spreads across 150 acres. After several check dams were constructed in the stream, water rarely reached the lake. It has been more than 20 years since the lake reached its full capacity, locals said. A year ago, locals and activists joined hands to form Kothavadi lake restoration committee to restore the lake by strengthening its bunds. They started doing it manually on weekends with the help of a private firm that offered corporate social responsibility fund for the initiative. With the Thirumoorthy dam’s catchment areas receiving copious rain this year, villagers urged authorities to fill the lake using water from the Parambikulam-Aliyar Project channel. Pollachi MP K Shanmugasundaram took up the issue and got approval to release water to the water body. Water is expected to reach the lake on Friday, Kothavadi village panchayat president K R Rathinasamy said. “Officials concerned have promised to supply water till the lake is filled to the brim. It will benefit thousands of acres of land directly and indirectly,” he told TOI. S Sivaraja of Kousika Neerkarangal Team, which provided technical expertise for lake restoration, urged the government to issue an order to release water to the lake regularly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/kinathukadavu-farmers-upbeat-as-water-released-to-kothavadi-lake/articleshow/87655322.cms||---

The SP leader while addressing the people at the Kashyap Sammelan in Budhana, launched a scathing attack on CM Yogi Adityanath. Referring to the latter's recent poll speech in Kairana, Akhilesh said, "Recently, the chief minister came here and said exodus had taken place. But the reality is that had it not been Baba's exodus from Uttarakhand, UP's five years wouldn't be wasted." Speaking on three contentious farm laws and unemployment, he said, "The government has been repeatedly insulting the farmers. These laws will give a free hand to big businessmen to capture your farm land. They (government) do not talk about employment because it brings people together, while they are people who spread hate among the communities." Attacking the government on the state's health services, Akhilesh said, "We had launched '108' to call an ambulance at your doorstep and that service was being used during Covid-19 outbreak, but the government had failed to provide treatment during the pandemic. If oxygen had been provided properly, many lives could have been saved." Reminding Gorakhpur "encounter" incident, the SP chief said, "The state government has adopted a 'thoko' policy. Baba claims law and order are okay in the state, but he should tell us if there is any place in the country where cops commit murder."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/no-possibility-of-any-alliance-with-aimim-for-up-polls-says-akhilesh/articleshow/87653888.cms||Mohd Dilshad

A total of 86 farmers from Shiye village have given no objection certificate (NOC) to the district collector for land acquisition. Pandurang Patil, the head of Shiye Tantamukt Samiti said, “If the government gives five times the land acquisition cost, then the villagers from Shiye are ready to give the land. The decision was made in the meeting of the villagers and the no objection certificate has been given to district collector, guardian minister, member of parliament, MLA and road development authority. Tanaji Patil, the former sarpanch of Bhuyewadi, said, “Agricultural land from Bhuyewadi village will be acquired for the proposed construction of the Nagpur-Ratnagiri National Highway. Road development is also needed. Therefore, there is no objection for land acquisition from Gat no. 151 and 152 in Bhuyewadi. But the land acquisition charges set by the government vary as per the ready reckoner rates of the land, which is not feasible for all. Hence, the government should give us five times land cost for all the farmers whose land will be acquired. Also the highway authority should ensure that the farmers and villagers face minimum loss in land acquisition for the proposed highway".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/residents-of-2-villages-demand-5-times-land-acquisition-cost/articleshow/87653183.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

During his deposition for the second consecutive day, Janakiram on Thursday said that he did not state that he saw pistols in the hands of Arif and Chennakeshavulu after the exchange of fire at Chattanpally encounter site and his 161 CrPC statement, recorded by investigating officer (IO) J Surender Reddy, was wrong to that effect. Answering a question from the commission on why he did not tell IO about the pistols, Janakiram said that due to fear he did not inform the IO that his statement was incorrectly recorded. “I was scared to death by the incident because it was the first time such a thing occurred to me. I would have died in it,” he added. Janakiram also said that he had not recovered from the fear even 12 hours after the incident when the IO recorded the statement later that day. Janakiram stated that Arif picked up soil from the fifth bund and threw it in his eyes and when he tried to catch him, the accused pushed him away, subsequently throwing soil in the direction of CI K Narasimha Reddy and other members of the police party. When the commission’s advocate said that in his affidavit, filed before the commission, it was stated that Arif first pushed him and then picked up the soil, Janakiram replied, “I had told my advocate but he said that the order of the events did not matter.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/shooting-scared-me-to-death-constable/articleshow/87654685.cms||Mahesh Buddi

BJP has stayed out of the contest, while Congress too skipped as it didn’t have the numbers. Eighteen nominations — 11 TRS and & 7 AIMIM — were received for the 15-member committee, according to a release from the GHMC commissioner’s office. The election on November 20 may end up becoming a unanimous affair if the two friendly parties, TRS and AIMIM, come to an understanding. “In that case there would be 8 from TRS and 7 from AIMIM in the Standing Committee comprising 15 members,” an analyst said. The last date of withdrawal of nominations is November 15. Of the 150 GHMC wards, 56 are from TRS, 47 from BJP, 44 from AIMIM and 3 from Congress. With the BJP deciding not to make a contest out of the Standing Committee elections despite its stupendous show in the GHMC polls, its Malkajgiri ward corporator Vurapalli Sravan said that the party high command would clarify on the reasons in a couple of days. The political temperature in the city and the state has been high since the BJP’s bypoll win in Huzurabad.

Aged 11 and 12 years respectively, the duo will renounce the world in February 2022 and accept monkhood. Both underwent rigorous training of over two and half years and have walked for more than 700kms before they were chosen for diksha. Twelve-year-old Aanshi Shah, daughter of billionaire diamantaire in the city, had quit studies when she was eight only. The minor girl had developed interest in becoming a monk from a very tender age and started spending time with Jain monks at different places. Aanshi has also walked several kilometres with other monks and has also undergone the rigorous 30-day fast as well. “I have enjoyed life. But I find real happiness, peace and unity with the monks. Hence, I decided to join them for the rest of my life,” Aanshi told TOI. However, while she prepares to renounce the materialistic world, her father, Dipak Shah, wants to give his daughter the joys of the world before she accepts the colourless life. Shah will take Aanshi to Dubai. “I wish to take her once on a foreign trip. I feel proud that my daughter has been chosen to become a monk,” he said. Aanshi will take diksha under guidance of Gunratnasurishwarji Maharaj and Rashmiratnasurishwarji Maharaj. Meanwhile, her friend Viha Shah (11) was very categorical when she announced her decision to adopt monkhood to her her parents. She was clear that she will take diksha this year, though the parents persuaded her to delay it for a few years more till she grows older. Along with Viha, her father Shravak (45) and mother Sonal (43) too will renounce the world on the same day. “My son Kshama Shraman Vijayji Maharaj, now 18, took diksha when he was 13. He is an inspiration for all of us. We all have lived a materialistic life and wish to follow my son now,” said Sonal. Viha, who loves to click and post photos on Instagram, passed several tough tests before being approved for diksha. Shravak was working in a diamond unit but had to quit job to prepare for Diksha and started following strict routines as per the guidance of senior monks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/two-friends-set-to-take-diksha-in-surat/articleshow/87654169.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

Later, he agreed to perform the ‘nikah’ only after the groom’s family apologized for their conduct. The high-voltage drama lasted for nearly two hours. Marriage of the son of a businessman hailing from Talaq Mahal area was to be solemnised with a girl of Jajmau area on Tuesday. A band accompanied the marriage procession and there were fireworks too. “When the procession reached the marriage venue, the DJ -band started playing and there were fireworks which upset shahar qazi Maulana Mushtaq Mushahidi and he refused to conduct the marriage. The matter reached the senior members of the area, who made the groom’s family and guests, who danced to the DJ music, apologise,” said sources. The Qazi said, “Band-DJ and fireworks are un-Islamic, besides it’s also sheer wastage of money. After hours of apology, I agreed to conduct the nikah. Wherever such an instance will occur, I would not conduct marriage.” To recall, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board had released a new nikahnama for the Muslims in the country that banned series of ceremonies in March 2021. The 11-point nikahnama restricted the Muslim community from having ceremonies like ‘manjha’ (haldi ceremony) and other “un-Islamic” traditions like marriage procession, DJ, dancing, fireworks and dowry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/qazi-objects-to-dj-fireworks-refuses-to-conduct-nikah/articleshow/87654707.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

While Banupriya was residing at Virudhunagar, her husband Vignesh was residing in Madurai district. On August 20, at around 10.15pm Banupriya was found dead under suspicious circumstances.Based on the complaint given by Banupriya’s relative stating that she was strangulated to death using her uniform belt by Vignesh during a quarrel, the Soolakkarai police registered a case against him under Section 302 (murder) of the IPC.Banupriya’s father, R Chandrasekar, of Ramanathapuram district filed a petition before the HC Madurai bench seeking a CB-CID probe in this case. The counsel for the petitioner submitted that the investigation is not proceeding on the right lines and the police are yet to arrest Vignesh.Meanwhile, Vignesh had also filed a petition before the HC Madurai bench seeking to quash the criminal case registered against him. Vignesh’s counsel submitted that the case of suicide was converted to murder without any basis. He submitted that the postmortem report also indicates it as a suicide.The additional public prosecutor submitted that initial features on the deceased body indicates it was a suicide, however, they are awaiting the forensic reports.Taking cognizance of the submissions, justice G R Swaminathan observed that the deceased person in this case is a police woman and therefore the officials would take earnest steps to bring out the truth in this case. Since the father of the deceased has certain misgivings about the investigation, the judge directed the DSP concerned to monitor the investigation and disposed of the petition filed by Chandrasekar.The judge further observed that the prayer sought for by Vignesh to quash the criminal case cannot be accepted at this point of time. Though the additional public prosecutor has given a tentative opinion that it is a case of suicide, they are awaiting the final forensic opinion. Observing that it is too early to come to a conclusion for terminating the investigation, the judge dismissed the petition filed by Vignesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/monitor-probe-in-woman-cop-death-case-hc-to-dsp/articleshow/87654709.cms||---

The contraband was hidden inside 22 photo frames and booked at an international courier service centre at Begumpet. Hyderabad police, during a press conference, said that two parcels were interdicted at the courier agency in Begumpet on Tuesday. When the specific parcels were opened, based on information, the officials found photo frames, bangles and other articles. The photographs were of a Punjabi wedding. “When the boxes were opened as per procedure to check the item and its weight. It was then the parcel booking agent got suspicious since the weight of the frame was heavier than usual. On suspicion when they opened it, the neatly packed drug packets came to light,'' sources in Hyderabad police told TOI. “On careful examination, they discovered a plastic cover containing white powder-like substance sandwiched between the two layers of the frame,’‘ Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar said. When the seized substance was tested, it turned out to be pseudoephedrine. “Preliminary investigations revealed that the consignments were booked using fraudulent Aadhaar card having Hyderabad address by two persons, possibly from Tamil Nadu,” police said. The accused, who booked the parcel, has been captured in a CCTV footage and cops are looking for him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/14kg-banned-drug-bound-for-oz-seized/articleshow/87654711.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||AP: Covid cases account for 20% ‘108’ services||VIJAYAWADA: Owing to Covid-19, revamped ‘108’ ambulance services saw a 41% increase in medical emergency services between July 2020 and September 2021 compared to the corresponding period in previous year. According to the data from Aurobindo Emergency Medical Services (EMS) which operates ‘108’ and ‘104’ ambulances in the state, out of 12.9 lakh emergencies catered to during the period, a majority of them, accounting for 20%, happened to be Covid-related. Speaking to TOI, Suresh Kamle, operations head of ‘108’ EMS, prior to the pandemic, major emergencies included road accidents and pregnancies. With the inclusion of 432 ‘108’ ambulances, Kamle explains that there is a spike in number of emergencies that are attended to. After Covid, 18% of the emergencies relate to pregnancies. Due to lockdown during the second wave, the number of road accidents has dropped, accounting for only 10% of the total emergencies. Other major emergencies include breathing difficulties, kidney problems, loss of consciousness, poisoning and chest pain. Interestingly, snake bites rank 13th with 17,664 instances in AP. Officials said that during the peak of Covid-19, ‘108’ services faced oxygen shortage and had to rely on outside agencies apart from the regular vendors to cater to the high demand. Previously, average daily medical emergencies stood around 1,400 per day, now the number has touched 3,350. “In the revamped ‘108’ services, we have ensured that every mandal has at least one ambulance. Compared to past, we now have an ambulance for every 74,609 population. Previously, it used to be one ambulance for every 1.19 lakh people,” Kamle told TOI. Another advantage the new fleet has offered is the improved response time of the ambulances. “The time taken to attend to an emergency is between 15 to 20 minutes in urban areas and maximum 25 minutes in rural areas,” Kamle added. By next January, Kamle said, the government would be adding another 432 mobile medical units (MMUs) to the existing 656 MMUs of the ‘104’ emergency fleet. Based on mandals in districts, most MMUs are currently serving in Anantapur, Chittoor and East Godavari districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/covid-cases-account-for-20-108-services/articleshow/87653892.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Of the three, two are doing their BTech, while another is studying for BBA. The youngsters were sourcing the contraband through an app and police pegged its street value at about Rs 3 lakh. The accused claimed that they were buying the drugs from Goa, Asif Nagar police said. Police said that they nabbed Ajay Sai and R Ankith from Mehdipatnam and seized 50 pills of MDMA. Based on their confession, police seized another 60 pills from Dharawath Sai Charan, who appeared to be the one running the operations. Ajay and Charan are studying engineering, while Ankith is the BBA student. According to police, Sai Charan has been into the drug business for nearly a year and was purchasing it via the app. The suppliers either sent the drugs to the accused through their own delivery men or on some occasions utilised the services of courier agents. “Sai Charan was peddling the drugs through his associates Ankith and Ajay,” joint commissioner of police (West Zone) AR Srinivas told reporters. Police, who were in the process of taking the three into custody for further interrogation, said that they would be probing who was running the app. As of now, all the customers who were in touch with the peddlers were being treated as victims, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/btech-bba-students-held-for-selling-mdma-pills/articleshow/87654713.cms||---

Parents alleged that the school failed to take necessary precautions and added that many students are down with Covid-like symptoms. “I was forced to send my son to school as the schools stopped concentrating on children attending classes in online mode. Within two days, my son started developing Covid-19 symptoms. Today, I am taking the Covid-19 test as one of his classmates tested positive for the virus,” said a parent, whose son is studying in class 9. The parent said that despite requesting the school not to start offline classes, the management was adamant and parents had no choice. “I went to school personally and tried to convince the management not to start offline classes. My son hardly went to school for two days and he is already sick,” the parent added. The school, which has multiple branches in the city, resumed online classes on November 1. Hardly 10 days later, it was forced to shut down physical classes as a student tested positive for Covid-19. Parents said that they cannot take the risk of sending their children for physical classes unless the managements guarantee that all Covid-19 protocols are followed religiously. They said that it would be better if the management traces all the students who have come in contact with the student who tested positive for Covid-19 and inform the parents so that they would take necessary precautions. “The management should think twice before starting offline classes again. We can’t risk our children’s lives in the current situation where many children are testing positive for Covid-19,” said another parent. Parents said that there is a possibility that Covid-19 cases are being reported in several schools in the city and elsewhere in the state, but managements are hiding them and silently shifting back to online mode.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/school-shuts-after-kid-tests-veparents-slam-offline-class-move/articleshow/87654715.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

This extensive study will help in improving the quality of crop in the coming days by making it more resilient to climate change. As part of this study, an international team of researchers from 41 organisations led by ICRISAT has charted out chickpea’s pangenome by sequencing the genomes of 3,366 chickpea lines from 60 countries. It has done genome sequencing of 3,171 cultivated accessions and 195 wild accessions of chickpea that are conserved in multiple genebanks. The team has identified 29,870 genes that include 1,582 previously unreported novel genes. As part of the study, a comparison of the genetic variation in cultivated chickpea with that of its wild progenitor helped the researchers identify genes responsible for lowering crop performance. The study also identified blocks of genes (haplotypes) in domesticated varieties developed by farmers that can enhance performance of the crop. “We examined 129 varieties released in the past. Though a few superior haplotypes were detected in some of these varieties, we found that most varieties lacked many beneficial haplotypes. We have arrived at 56 promising lines that can bring these haplotypes into breeding programmes to develop enhanced varieties,” Dr Manish Roorkiwal, a senior scientist in genomics and molecular breeding at ICRISAT said. Dr Trilochan Mohapatra, director general, Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), and an author on the study, pointed out that the research can help countries like India boost crop production while making crops climate-resilient. Grown in more than 50 countries, chickpea is the world’s third-most cultivated legume. Dr Jacqueline Hughes, Director General, ICRISAT, said, “By developing many genomic resources for chickpea over the last decade, ICRISAT has helped the crop shed its ‘orphan’ tag. With our partners in agricultural research for development, we will continue to research chickpea and translate findings into crop varieties that benefit farmers, consumers and nations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/icrisat-led-study-conducts-largest-genome-sequencing-exercise-for-chickpea/articleshow/87654717.cms||---

Earlier, the student’s candidature was rejected during admissions under the third cutoff list. Kumar Ashutosh, the teacher-in-charge of the course, said, “In the fourth list, I saw that the particular student had paid the fees. I remember her admission was rejected earlier, and she had raised a grievance. The student had wrongly calculated the cutoff and the same was notified to the college admission committee as well. I was shocked to see that her candidature was accepted in the fourth list.” The matter was raised with the admission committee and it was discussed in a meeting on November 9. Ashutosh even wrote to the chairman of the governing body of the college. “It was decided in the meeting that the majority will decide if it is a case of illegal admission. There were some problems with her OBC certificate too,” claimed Ashutosh. On Thursday, CVS principal Inder Jeet Dagar wrote an email to the committee members that read, “As you are all aware that TIC tourism pointed out that the particular student was a case of the third list but has been inadvertently admitted in the fourth cutoff list. Therefore, her admission may be cancelled after informing the candidate.” Surinder Singh, the admission convenor in a text reply to the admission committee, however, said, “There has been no illegal admission in the college.” The principal did not respond to queries from TOI in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-teacher-objects-to-admission-of-student-who-wrongly-calculated-cutoff/articleshow/87655358.cms||Shradha Chettri

The manager of the hotel, John Kuria Kosh, will also be arrested after he returns from Ahmedabad, said cops who had arrested 10 people from inside the room on Wednesday. Police said that receptionist Priti Patel had provided the key to the room to the gamblers at the behest of Kosh even as the Aadhaar card the latter had emailed her for hotel records did not match with any of the occupants of the room. Cops also said that Kosh was the key person as he instructed Patel to provide the room after being approached by the main gambler Narendrasinh Jadeja. To facilitate entry records, Kosh had provided an Aadhaar card of one Sohil Kothiya, a Surendranagar resident in his absence, to Patel. During investigation, cops also came to know that the hotel room had been used for gambling activities for the past one month. Gamblers had come there for four times by paying the room tariff of Rs 15,000. For one game they used to shell out Rs 500 each. Cops had also seized Rs 10.2 lakh in cash, besides 13 mobile phones and two SUV cars from the gamblers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/hotel-receptionist-held-for-providing-room-to-gamblers/articleshow/87653935.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Increase in ethanol procurement price to help mills pay FRP: Experts||Kolhapur: The increase in the ethanol procurement price is likely to put the sugar mills in a better position to pay the fair and remunerative price (FRP) to sugar cane farmers, said industry experts. Farmers’ leaders said the mills should not have any problem now to pay even the additional money of up to Rs 50 per tonne of sugar cane to the farmers as they will benefit from the increase in procurement prices. The Centre has increased the procurement price of ethanol produced from B heavy type molasses by Rs 1.47 per litre. The mills with distilleries will, therefore, prefer to produce ethanol and the sugar production will come down by over 35 lakh tonne in the country. Since this quantum of sugar will not arrive in the market, the sugar prices in the open market will increase by Rs 1.5 to 2 per kg, which will also benefit the mills. Vijay Autade, a sugar cane industry expert said, “Production of more than 10 lakh tonne of sugar will not take place in Maharashtra in the upcoming season. The mills in Maharashtra suffer due to their distance from the non-sugar producing states. The mills have to spend more on transportation in comparison to the mills states like Uttar Pradesh, which are closer to the non-sugar producing states. Under such circumstances, increase in the ethanol price will put the mills in a better position to pay the amount to the sugar cane farmers.” Farmers’ leaders like Raju Shetti, of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, had sought an increase in the ethanol procurement price along the lines of the price rise in the international market. Shetti told TOI, “In the past two years, ethanol prices have increased by 60%. Therefore, we had demanded that the Centre increase the procurement price by Rs 10 per litre, which has not been done. Instead, prices have been increased by Rs 1.47 per litre. On the other hand, sugar is fetching around Rs 37 per kg in the open market. Therefore, both things have put the mills in a position to pay more than the FRP. We expect that the mills can easily pay Rs 50 per tonne in addition to the FRP, which we will insist on in the coming days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/increase-in-ethanol-procurement-price-to-help-mills-pay-frp-experts/articleshow/87653217.cms||---

Dhosi was also booked in two other murder cases and a dacoity case, but was acquitted in all three matters. A senior police officer said they have recorded the statements of Dhosi’s wife and son at Mumbra police station. The duo refused to speak to the media. The Dhosis reside in Mumbra’s Sri Lanka area. Gujarat police are expected to arrive in Mumbra in a day or two for further investigations. “Based on a tipoff, Gujarat police had nabbed Dhosi, a vegetable vendor, and Salim Kara and Ali Kara, both natives of the coastal Salaya town near Jamnagar, and found methamphetamine and heroin allegedly sourced from Pakistan,” said a police officer. “In 2008, Dhosi was arrested for murdering Pundalik Patil over a monetary dispute and chopping his body into three pieces. He was found convicted and sent to Kolhapur jail. He met Salim and Ali in jail and they may have hatched the conspiracy of pushing drugs,” the police officer added. According to police records, in 2007, Naupada police had booked Dhosi for allegedly kidnapping a man, Umesh Tanna, robbing his gold ornaments and chopping off his head. In 2005, Central police in Ulhasnagar had booked Dhosi for allegedly killing a bar girl Heena and the dacoity case had been registered at the Bazarpeth police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/guj-drug-haul-mumbra-man-was-on-parole-in-murder-case/articleshow/87655790.cms||Nishikant Karlikar

Agriculture and civil supplies department officials will visit paddy fields to buy crop based on e-crop enrolment. Government estimated that a yield of around 80 lakh metric tonnes is expected to be produced from about 40 lakh acres during current season and set a target of procuring around 50 lakh metric tonnes from farmers. The government procured a record volume of 47 lakh metric tonnes of stock during the last Kharif season by spending close to Rs 9000 crore. Interestingly, the state government had pressed Markfed into service to extend support to the civil supplies department. The civil supplies department had identified about 6,884 RBKs for procurement of paddy in different districts. Civil supplies minister Kodali Sri Venkateswara Rao and commissioner Girija Sankar took stock of the situation and directed joint collectors in all districts to get ready to launch procurement operations. Joint collectors were directed to coordinate with field-level teams in RBKs to provide best possible services to farmers. “No farmer should be denied opportunity to sell their stock. Every grain should be procured by the department without allowing millers or middlemen to enter the scene,” said civil supplies commissioner Girija Sankar. The government brought further amendments to the procurement policy to help farmers easily sell their stocks. The government is also readying plans to clear the paddy procurement dues within 21 days of purchase. The government announced a Minimum Support Price of Rs 1,960 per quintal for A grade and Rs 1,940 for common variety of paddy. The paddy procured would be shifted to the local rice mills for milling purpose. The millers had to return the rice under Custom Milling Rice system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/6884-rbks-to-buy-paddy-during-kharif/articleshow/87653943.cms||Samdani MN
---||Goa||Goa: 100-million-year-old Jurassic forests thrive in Sanguem||KERI: In Talauli, Bhati, inside the Netravali Wildlife Sanctuary, there stand patches of relic forests with the unique Myristica swamp ecosystem, which are over 100 million years old. These swamp forests are endemic to the Western Ghats and a smaller distribution exists in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The Myristica swamp ecosystem plays a crucial role in maintaining a perennial stream flow and has immense potential to store carbon, thus helping the globe in reducing carbon emissions. “In Bhati, there are already two places, Barazan and Suryagal, which have the Myristica swamp vegetation. As these areas are inside sanctuaries they have been protected and prove to be perennial sources of water for wildlife,” range forest officer of Netravali sanctuary, Bipin Faldesai, said. These freshwater swamps fall under the umbrella category of ecologically sensitive areas and Myristica swamps are classified as unique evergreen regions. In 1999, the area of the Myristica swamp in Talauli was included in the Netravali Wildlife Sanctuary. However, the Goa government allowed mining activities in nearby areas to continue, which meant the threat of destruction hung over these ancient forest patches. When on November 7, 2003, the Centrally Empowered Committee constituted by the Supreme Court directed the Goa government to stop even removal of grass from the sanctuaries, this helped protect the swamp vegetation legally. “There is urgent need to map and carry out further research on Myristica swamp across the Western Ghats by documenting genetic diversity and local threats,” wildlifer from Kasarpal in Bicholim, Subodh Naik, said. These trees help in retaining water during the monsoon and then gradually release it during lean seasons. Varied species of flora and fauna inhabit these enigmatic ecosystems. The forest has evolved to live in the waterlogged conditions of swamps with knee roots and stilt roots. Knee roots emerge from the ground and are used for exchanging gases, while stilt roots sprout from the main trunk and help support the trees mechanically in the soft and unstable soil. “The forest dwelling communities earlier residing in Talauli in Bhati were aware about the ecological importance of these evergreen patches of forests and hence they protected the area as sacred groves. However, for the last century or so these communities have gone into oblivion,” Gokuldas Babuso Gaonkar, 60, from Potre in Sanguem, said, highlighting the need for special conservation efforts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/100-million-yr-old-jurassic-forests-thrive-in-sanguem/articleshow/87654765.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar
---||Kolkata||At some CU colleges, student’s jab certificate will be entry pass||Kolkata: Students’ vaccination certificates may be treated as entry passes at a few colleges in the city when campuses reopen on November 16. Those institutes have asked the students to submit their vaccination certificates before going in for their on-campus classes. Calcutta University-affiliated colleges, such as Loreto, Maulana Azad, Asutosh and Scottish Church, are some of the institutes which have taken this step for “safety purpose”. Heads of the departments have been given the responsibility of circulating the message among their students. Loreto College has formed a Covid Care Committee and Covid Sanitization and Fumigation Committee to ensure safety measures are maintained. Third and fifth-semester undergraduate students and those in MA and BEd will attend on-campus classes from November 16. “Soft copies of Covid vaccination certificates of students arriving on the campus will be received by the HoDs. The college is taking all precautions to ensure a safe environment and will review the modalities 10 days later,” said principal Christine Coutinho. But New Alipore College will not ask students to show vaccination certificate immediately, but once they start attending classes, the authorities will collect their details and build a database. Principal Jaydeep Sarangi said, “Once we have details of their vaccination status, we can arrange for a vaccination camp for those who are yet to get their second dose or even the first.” Even Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira officials said they would help their students get their second doses. “Most of our students have received both the doses of vaccine, but some are yet to get their second ones. We will help students coming to the campus get their second doses, if required,” said Swami Mahaprajnanada, vice-principal at the college. When the higher education department had published a guideline on campus reopening, it had not mentioned anything about students’ vaccination. Some college authorities have decided not to call freshers to the campus immediately as many of them—close to 30% of them—might still be below 18 years and may not have received their vaccines yet. “If we call those unvaccinated youngsters to the campus, we will put them at risk. The government should have spelt out the norm on this issue,” said the principal of a south Kolkata college. Like at Loreto, heads of the departments at Scottish Church will collect the soft copies of vaccination certificates of UG third and fifth semesters who will go to college after November 16. At least one dose is a must for attending physical classes. “A vaccination camp was arranged. It is expected third and fifth-semester students would have at least one dose. Without it, no one will be allowed to attend on-campus classes,” said vice-principal Supratim Das. Asutosh College and Maulana Azad have taken a similar decision. “All classes have their WhatsApp groups. Over there, students have been told to show their vaccination certificates when they enter the college,” said an Asutosh College official. Maulana Azad principal Subhasis Dutta said, “Students have to submit vaccination certificates and consent letters from their parents before stepping into campuses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/at-some-cu-colleges-students-jab-certificate-will-be-entry-pass/articleshow/87654784.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Agra||AMU prof receives Rs 10 lakh ransom note with 3 empty cartridges||Agra: Aligarh police on Wednesday arrested three persons, including the nephew of a woman professor of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), for allegedly sending her a ransom letter, along with empty gun cartridges, demanding Rs 10 lakh from her. Police said five persons, including the prime accused, Danish Ali, who is a nephew of Dr Shagufta Moin, professor in department of biochemistry in AMU’s Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, had planned to extort money from her. While Danish and two of his friends — Anjeb Rehman and Deepak Tewari -- have been arrested, their accomplices Mohd Naved and Mohd Adnan are absconding. Deepak had managed to procure a SIM card using a fake ID proof to call the professor’s family, said police. During interrogation, Danish told police that he needed money to repay his debts. He claimed that he had earlier asked for Rs 1 lakh from Dr Moin for the treatment of his newborn child but she had refused and his baby had died. He said he wanted to take revenge on her, and thus planned to extort money by threatening her. An FIR was registered under section 387 (putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt, in order to commit extortion), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 120 B (criminal conspiracy) of IPC at Kawarsi police station on a basis of a complaint filed by Dr Moin’s husband, Naved Mukhtar, a businessman. Another FIR was lodged against the accused under section 3/25 of the Arms Act. In the FIR, Mukhtar, stated that his wife had received a call from a person who identified himself as Raju from Noida on Monday evening, asking her to pick up an envelope lying outside their house. “When I opened the envelope, which was placed on the hood of my car, I found three empty cartridges that had our names written on them, and a letter demanding a ransom of Rs 10 lakh,” the FIR reads. Circle officer (Civil Lines) Shwetabh Pandey told TOI that police have recovered a country-made pistol, along with a live cartridges from the accused. The SIM card that used to make the phone call was also recovered. He said the arrested accused have been remanded in judicial custody, and a manhunt has been launched to nab the other two accused. When contacted, Dr Moin refused to comment on the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/amu-prof-receives-rs-10-lakh-ransom-note-with-3-empty-cartridges/articleshow/87653958.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

District Judge Ramesh Kumar said since the directions passed by the magistrate court regarding the supply of a copy of the chargesheet has already been complied with, there was no requirement for any inquiry to be conducted by the Delhi Police commissioner. A magistrate court had on April 12 directed the investigating officer (IO) to supply a copy of the e-challan to the accused, but it was not supplied till September 25. The IO had sought an adjournment for compliance with the order, saying he was not aware of any such direction given by the court. The court had then allowed the request of adjournment but imposed a cost of Rs 5,000 to be deposited by Delhi Police in the Prime Minister Relief Fund and directed the commissioner of Delhi Police to conduct an inquiry to fix the responsibility and deduct the amount from the salary of the alleged erring official. Police had challenged the magistrate court order before the sessions court. The sessions court said in its order on November 2, “It is further pointed out that directions, regarding supply of e-challan, have already been complied with by the concerned police official. Since the directions passed by the trial court regarding supply of copy of challan have already been complied with, there is no requirement for any inquiry to be conducted by the police commissioner.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-sets-aside-rs-5k-cost-on-io-for-supplying-chargesheet-late/articleshow/87655364.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The forest department had set up a cage about eight days ago after the villagers complained about spotting the big cat in the area. Moreover, a leopard had also attacked a 58-year-old resident two days ago. The victim escaped with minor injuries. The officials of the forest department said a health check-up of the leopard was conducted and the health condition of the big cat is good. Meanwhile, there have been several incidents of leopard attacks in the last few months. So far, three have succumbed to leopard attacks in the district in the last one-and-a-half-month. A 5-year-old girl was killed in a leopard attack in Wadgaon village on September 30. On October 3, a 4-year-old girl was killed in a leopard attack in Duber village in Dindori taluka. An 11-year-old boy was attacked by a leopard on October 18 at Kaluste-Darewadi in Igatpuri taluka, leading to the death of the boy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/forest-dept-rescues-leopard-in-igatpuri/articleshow/87653235.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Probe if Aryan case witnesses have links with Guj seizures’||Mumbai: NCP minister Nawab Malik on Thursday asked the DG of Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to probe if key witnesses in the Aryan Khan case have links with the massive drug seizures in Gujarat, which appears to be the centre of contraband trading. On Wednesday, Gujarat police had seized drugs worth over Rs 300 crore from the coastal Devbhumi Dwarka district, while on September 21, 3,000kg of drugs worth Rs 21,000 crore had been recovered from Mundra port. Claiming that BJP activist Vilas Bhanushali, Sunil Patil and NCB witness Kiran Gosavi—all involved in the cruise drug bust case—frequently visited Gujarat and enjoyed five-star facilities, Malik said: “NCB and NIA must probe if the Bhanushalis, Patil and Gosavi have links with these drug seizures...I feel that drugs are distributed across the country from Gujarat.” Malik further said that “innocent film stars” were paraded before the NCB office for alleged possession of negligible quantity of drugs, but even after seizing drugs worth Rs 21,000 crore, there is no disclosure from the agency over its source. Endorsing Malik’s views, Congress national spokesperson Pawan Khera claimed that the NCB has blown the Aryan case out of proportion to divert attention from the major drug seizures from Gujarat. “It appears that there is lack of seriousness; the NCB is headless for more than 18 months,” he said. Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said that the seizure of drugs in Gujarat’s Dwarka was a very serious matter. “ ...Now (NCB zonal director Sameer) Wankhede should look there. NCB should look into whether the children of the rich in Gujarat and the people of the film world are into drugs.” He advised to stop the ongoing tussle between Malik and BJP leaders. “In Wednesday’s cabinet meeting, Malik was lauded and supported. CM Uddhav Thackeray also praised him and said ‘good going’. Therefore, Malik’s battle has gained a moral ground. In the end, truth will prevail and the truth is on our side,” he said. —Prafulla Marpakwar & Chaitanya Marpakwar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-probe-if-aryan-case-witnesses-have-links-with-guj-seizures/articleshow/87655805.cms||---

So, we requested them to drop the case. On October 8, 2020, he told us he was withdrawing the case in next few days but withdrew the case after eight months. We are not responsible for any delay here.” Shekhawat said the Centre was working hard to establish a new tribunal quickly and even sought advice of legal department. “How can KCR, who is in charge of a government, speak like that? This is undemocratic,” he said. He went on to say the SC had decided to dismiss the case and following it, the Centre began the process of establishing a new tribunal. “KCR made various claims against me recently. It is my job to clarify and I am providing clarity to people of both states and the country,” he said. Shekhawat said there has been no apex council meeting in seven years. “But, I made arrangements and an apex council meeting was held with CMs of both states. If there was any delay, it was due to their disagreements,” he said. The minister said unless purview of boards was decided, no action could be taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/shekhawat-wades-intorow-on-water-tribunals/articleshow/87654757.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Gurgaon||Air turned ‘severe’, but at DLF-2, noise levels moderated||Gurgaon: Though post-Diwali air quality in the city plummeted to its worst in six years this time, noise pollution saw a reduction this Diwali in the residential area that was sampled. According to data from two monitoring stations installed by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), DLF-2 (residential area) saw a 5.5% dip in decibel levels this Diwali, while at Sohna Road (commercial area), noise levels were almost on a par with the festival day last year. The two stations measured noise in decibels (A-weighted), the relative loudness of sounds in air as perceived by the human ear. This Diwali, the peak noise level was 65.3db(A) at the DLF-2 station. The average was 64.2dB(A), the lowest in four years. The average level was 71dB(A) on Diwali in 2018, 70dB(A) in 2019 and 68dB(A) last year. At the Sohna Road station, the peak was 81dB(A) this Diwali, while the average noise level was 70.1dB(A), a slight rise from last year’s 70dB(A). It was 71dB(A) on Diwali in 2018 and 69dB(A) in 2019. Noise pollution levels recorded over a six-hour period this Diwali were between 61dB(A) and 65.3 dB(A) in DLF-2 and between 68dB(A) and 81dB(A) at Sohna Road. “Though Diwali witnessed a spike in air pollution, there was less traffic volume on Sohna Road and crackers with low intensity were burst at DLF-2, resulting in a decline in noise levels,” said Ram Niwas, an HSPCB scientist. This year, like last year, HSPCB had installed noise meters at two locations. In comparison, the pollution control board had installed meters at four locations — DLF-2, Sohna Road, IMT Manesar and bus stand — in 2019 and 2018. The CPCB standard guidelines for noise pollution, which were notified in 2000, recommend not more than 55dB noise in residential areas, 65dB in commercial areas and 75dB in industrial areas during the daytime. At night, the corresponding upper limits are 45dB, 55dB and 70dB. Need for more noise monitoring stations With just two areas monitored for noise pollution on Diwali, the data isn’t indicative for the entire city, according to experts.  They suggested that several locations should be chosen for installing meters. “Ideally, more locations should be covered to study noise fluctuations before and on Diwali in the city,” said Sachin Panwar, an expert on air and noise pollution. “Simply putting a noise meter in an area at random won’t serve the purpose. The authorities should get in touch with RWAs across the city, and through them, educate residents about the impact of noise pollution. Moreover, Old Gurgaon and new areas in the city are not being represented in the current data. The monitoring stations are only at two locations, which isn’t giving a fair view of the situation,” Panwar added. A senior HSPCB official said they plan to set up a continuous, real-time noise measuring system with digital display boards and a centralised network at four locations. “We have a plan for installing permanent noise monitoring stations in Gurgaon soon. They will monitor noise levels continuously round the clock,” the official said, adding that HSPCB already has a network of air quality monitoring stations and is likely to install the noise monitoring stations in the same locations — Vikas Sadan, Teri Gram, Gwalpahari and Sector 51. Residents in areas like sectors 50, 57, 89, 90 and 92 that TOI spoke to said crackers hadn’t seemed muted in their neighbourhoods on Diwali evening. “Bursting of crackers started at 7pm on Diwali and continued till 11pm. We couldn’t sleep and my husband faced breathing difficulties due to pollution,” said Rekha Aggarwal, a resident of Sector 57. “There are no civic bodies to monitor newly-developed sectors. A few residents went on bursting crackers all night,” said Punit Kaushal, resident of Sector 89. In areas like DLF-2, MG Road and Sushant Lok, on the other hand, residents said instances of loud crackers going off were isolated ones. “I could hear faint sounds of crackers. Nothing very noisy,” said Tanvi Nayak, a resident of DLF-2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/air-turned-severe-but-at-dlf-2-noise-levels-moderated/articleshow/87649632.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Agra||UP custodial death: Hunt on for 'kidnapped' girl, magisterial probe on||AGRA: The Kasganj police have been unable to locate the 16-year-old Hindu girl that Mohammad Altaf, 22, who died in police custody on Tuesday, was accused of kidnapping. A special operation group (SOG) has now been asked to conduct a search. Earlier, the Kasganj police had claimed that Altaf strangled himself "using a drawstring in the hood of his jacket attached to a tap in the washroom." It was later revealed that Altaf was about 5.6 feet tall while the tap was less than three feet in height. This comes even as the FIR -- details of which tumbled out on Thursday -- filed against Altaf and an anonymous "friend" says that the girl left with the latter "taking her clothes and academic certificates to Delhi". The FIR was registered at the Sadar Kotwali police station under sections 363 and 366 (kidnapping and abduction) of the IPC. Altaf's family said events described in the FIR were "inaccurate". "Why would the girl remember to take her clothes and school certificates if she was being kidnapped, and why would any kidnapper allow that?" they questioned. His mother demanded a CBI probe over the alleged "murder" of her son in police custody. Superintendent of police, Kasganj, Botre Rohan Pramod said, “We are trying to find Altaf's friend who is involved in the kidnapping and abduction of the girl.” He added, “Primary investigation has revealed that Altaf and the girl had an affair but they eventually had a falling out. Altaf had confirmed during questioning that they had been in a relationship. We have the required evidence to prove this.” Police said that the two had met when the girl’s family carried out construction in their house five months ago and Altaf was hired as a labourer. A cousin of Altaf said, "Yes, Altaf knew the girl but he had nothing to do with her disappearance. It was not Altaf but his friend who had an affair with her. He used Altaf’s phone to call her. The police were informed about this after his arrest but they told us not to come to the station again. We were not even provided a copy of the FIR registered against him.” Family members said Altaf was picked up from home by the police on Monday at around 8 pm. They learned of his death in police custody through local reporters at roughly 6 pm on Tuesday. Altaf’s father Caahat Miyan said his son was not produced in front of a magistrate on Tuesday and they were not allowed to see the dead body before the post-mortem. Altaf’s mother Fatima said, “My husband was forced to sign a letter and record a statement confirming suicide in police custody. I have no trust in the local authorities. I want the death of my child to be investigated by the CBI.” District magistrate Harshita Mathur said, “A magisterial probe is being conducted. We have sent a proposal to the state government for monetary assistance to the family. We will also try to get a job for one of the family members.” Meanwhile, Opposition party leaders targeted the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government in UP over the state's law and order situation. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “Is there anything called human rights left in Uttar Pradesh?” Samajwadi Party leader and former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav also tweeted demanding a judicial inquiry. BSP president and former CM Mayawati called the incident "sad" and "shameful".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/hunt-on-for-kidnapped-girl-magisterial-probe-on/articleshow/87653980.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||India||Activists move Supreme Court challenging UAPA against lawyers by Tripura||NEW DELHI: A CPI(ML) member, a human rights activist and a web journalist moved the Supreme Court challenging the Tripura government's action of slapping the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act against lawyers who posted "Tripura is burning" and said the SC must give a restrictive meaning to "unlawful activities" under the UAPA to curb its rampant misuse. Tripura Police had earlier said that action had been taken against various social media handles for falsely claiming that mosques have been burned down in the state when this was not the case. A bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana initially asked petitioner's advocate, Prashant Bhushan, as to why they did not move the Tripura high court but agreed to fix a date for listing the petition for hearing. In general, the SC does not entertain petitions relating to state incidents and normally asks the petitioners to move the jurisdictional HC before approaching the apex court. First petitioner Mukesh Mukesh is an advocate registered with the Bar Council of Delhi and has been associated with the All-India Central Council of Trade Unions, the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) and the People's Union for Civil Liberties. The second petitioner is Ansarul Haq Ansari, who said he is a human rights activist from Rajasthan. And the third petitioner is Shyam Meera Singh, a journalist with web portal Newsclick who often highlights grievances of marginalised and minority communities. The petitioners said their grievance is against "the targeted political violence against the Muslim minorities in Tripura during the second half of October 2021, and the subsequent efforts by the state to monopolise the flow of information and facts emanating from the affected areas by invoking provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act against members of civil society including advocates and journalists who have made the effort to bring facts in relation to the targeted violence in the public domain". "If the state is allowed to criminalise the very act of fact-finding and reporting, and that too under the stringent provisions of the UAPA in which anticipatory bail is barred and the idea of bail is a remote possibility, then the only facts that will come in the public domain are those that are convenient to the state due to the ‘chilling effect’ on freedom of speech and expression of members of civil society. If the quest for truth and reporting thereof itself is criminalised then the victim in the process is the idea of justice," they said. The alleged communal violence had erupted in Tripura after Durga Puja pandals were targeted in Bangladesh. Two petitioners, Mukesh and Ansarul, had visited Tripura as members of a fact-finding team and had "put in the public domain a report titled 'Humanity Under Attack in Tripura', 'Muslim Lives Matter', published by Lawyers for Democracy, in a press release at the Press Club of India" leading to the invocation of UAPA against them by the Tripura government. Interestingly, the UAPA was enacted in 1967 to counter the threat of left-wing extremism to India and its sovereignty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/activists-move-supreme-court-challenging-uapa-against-lawyers-by-tripura/articleshow/87656367.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

According to police, Akash Ambasana (24), Ami Cholera (22) and Irfan Pattni (43) were found allegedly under influence of drugs from room 301 of a hotel on Racecourse road on October 22. The police also found three syringes — one empty, one partially used and the third was unused. The police had sent the syringes for forensic examination along with the blood samples of the trio. The forensic report confirmed that the syringes contained drug mephedrone and the same was found in the blood samples of the accused. Based on this report, Ambasana, Cholera and Pattani were booked under NDPS and Prohibition acts. Ambasana’s mother, Alka, on the night of October 21 had complained to police that her son had become a drug addict and was missing. The police found Akash with his ex-wife after searching throughout the night. The police later claimed that Cholera had decided to undergo a de-addiction programme and wanted to prepare for the police constable’s exam. The cops have also provided her with books and coaching to crack the exam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/struggling-cricketer-ex-wife-among-three-booked-under-ndps-act/articleshow/87654009.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||One-dose vax must for ration, LPG refill in Aurangabad, activists fume||Aurangabad: The Aurangabad district administration, after announcing that at least part vaccination is mandatory to avail of a series of services, has now extended the norm to getting rations through fair price shops and refilling LPG cylinders. Besides, part vaccination has also been made mandatory for farmers seeking returns after supplying their yield to the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC). The latest move has evoked sharp reactions from a section of civic activists, who say the administration should first spread awareness among the public to improve vaccine coverage. The administration has already made it compulsory for people to have taken at least one dose of the Covid vaccine to get petrol and diesel at fuel stations and to secure different documents from the RTO, Aurangabad. Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan has warned of action against those offering services to the unvaccinated under section 188 of the IPC (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), the Disaster Management Act 2005 and the Epidemic Diseases Act 1897. “Anticipating a possible third Covid wave, Aurangabad needs to considerably improve the vaccination coverage among the masses. With only 55% vaccination so far, Aurangabad has figured among districts with very poor vaccination coverage,” Chavan said. Civic activist Ram Baheti said it was inappropriate of the administration to deny rations and LPG refills to citizens if they were not vaccinated. “The district administration should first take awareness measures to increase the vaccination coverage. Only after such measures could any coercive action be contemplated,” he said. Another activist, Laxman Dhobale, said that farmers in the district were already badly affected by the recent heavy rains and the pandemic stretching for more than one-and-a-half years. “The authorities should first convince the public about the importance of vaccination. Any compelling action against farmers or the poor and needy for want for vaccination is highly undesirable,” he said. However, state food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal backed the order of the Aurangabad district administration. “Despite repeated appeals from PM Narendra Modi and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, a section of people is not serious about taking the vaccine. The Aurangabad administration has taken the right decision to deny rations to people who are not vaccinated. Such tough measures will help in increasing vaccine coverage,” he said. According to Bhujbal, people should remember that the last two waves of the pandemic had created havoc in the state and many had lost their lives. “Vaccination is needed to avoid any kind of severe wave that we have witnessed in the past,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/one-dose-vax-must-for-ration-lpg-refill-in-aurangabad-activists-fume/articleshow/87653268.cms||---
---||Delhi||City court slams filing of two separate chargesheets in minor’s rape-kidnap||New Delhi: A court has come down heavily on police for filing two separate chargesheets — one given to the court and the accused, and the other to the complainant and the public prosecutor — in a case of alleged kidnapping and rape of a 14-year-old girl, saying it is a classic case of abuse of power/authority. Additional sessions judge (ASJ) Gaurav Rao directed the commissioner of police to initiate appropriate inquiry/legal action and register a case under the appropriate provisions of IPC against the investigating officer/station house officer/assistant commissioner of police (IO/SHO/ACP) concerned for committing a fraud upon the court. The judge noted that material facts had been omitted in the chargesheet filed in the court and supplied to the accused as compared to those available with the additional public prosecutor representing police and the complainant. The court said both these chargesheets had the signatures of the IO/SHO/ACP concerned and were dated June 1, 2021. There cannot be any bigger fraud committed upon the court and there cannot be more prejudicial act than the one committed in the present case, the judge observed. “Filing of two distinct sets of chargesheet... amounts to perjury/fraud and cheating. It amounts to interference with the justice dispensation process… It is treachery of the highest order,” ASJ Rao said in the order on Monday. “The conduct/act of the IO/SHO/ACP is perfidious and reprehensible. Fraud has been played upon the court and this is a classic case of abuse of power/authority by police,” he added. The court further said the police officials had prejudiced the right of the accused to a fair trial. It added that there were other lapses in the present matter that were also grave and serious in nature and appeared to be “deliberate and intentional”. “To point the least, the statement of the counsellor and the house owner where the victim was allegedly kept had given a clean chit to the accused and pointed towards involvement of one Umer. The investigation is absolutely silent on this aspect,” ASJ Rao said. The court summoned the DCP, ACP/SHO Jamia Nagar and the investigating officer (IO) concerned to remain present on the next date of hearing. During the proceedings, additional public prosecutor Ashok Kumar also said he had brought several lapses to the notice of the CP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-court-slams-filing-of-two-separate-chargesheets-in-minors-rape-kidnap/articleshow/87655385.cms||Usha Das
---||Mumbai||Malik: ‘Reasonably verified’ docus about Wankhede in Mumbai||Mumbai: NCP minister Naw-ab Malik told Bombay high court that he “reasonably verified” NCB officer Sameer Wankhede’s birth certificate and nikahnama of his first marriage. He replied to the query from vacation judge Justice Madhav Jamdar on whether he verified documents before uploading them on social media. The HC heard a defamation suit filed by Wankhede’s father Dhyandev. Malik said the documents produced by him can be divided into two parts: Certificates issued by authorities, like Wankhede’s birth certificate and nikahnama of his first marriage with Dr Shabana Quraishi; and the tweets. “I have reasonably verified the documents contained in the first part.” He added that Wankhede’s birth certifica-te record is with E ward and there’s a register entry, while the nikahnama was given to him by “a relative of the first wife”. He said Wankhede, in his complaint, hasn’t said that the birth ce-rtificate or nikahnama are false and fabricated. Malik urged HC to dismiss Wankhede’s interim relief plea for an injunction against him. —Rosy Sequeira||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/malik-reasonably-verified-docus-about-wankhede-in-mumbai/articleshow/87655814.cms||Rosy Sequeira

---||Agra||Jail riots: Inmate died as cop’s gun went off after prisoners tried to snatch it, claim police||Agra: Days after riots broke out in Fatehgarh district jail, police claimed that a bullet -- which apparently killed an undertrial prisoner, Shivam Thakur, 26 -- was fired accidentally from the automatic weapon of a cop while inmates were making an attempt to snatch it from the policemen in a bid to take over the facility. Following these revelations, police have booked over 100 inmates on a complaint filed by circle officer (city) Pradeep Singh, alleging that the prisoners had attempted to snatch their weapons. “We had reached the jail after receiving information of riots and arson inside the facility and when we confronted the prisoners, they resorted to stone-pelting and attacked the police personnel,” Singh said in his complaint. The circle officer also alleged that some inmates surrounded him and tried to snatch his automatic gun, and during the scuffle the weapon accidentally went off. Though he didn’t say that the bullet hit anyone, the FIR states that he saw that one prisoner was subsequently taken to hospital with injuries. A second FIR against unidentified prisoners was registered under 15 sections of IPC, including 307 (attempt to murder), 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from doing his duty), 353 (whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person being a public servant ), 186 (whoever voluntarily obstructs any public servant in the discharge of his public functions), 506 (criminal intimidation), 336 (whoever does any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life or the personal safety of others), 398 (attempt to commit robbery or dacoity when armed with deadly weapon), 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house) and section 7 CLA at Fatehgarh Kotwali police station on Tuesday. The earlier FIR was lodged against 28 jail inmates under 16 sections of the IPC, including 307 (attempt to murder), 120 B (criminal conspiracy) along with Prevention of Damage of Public Property Act, 1884, on a complaint filed by jailor Akhilesh Kumar. Just before his death, Thakur, had told media persons that he had been shot by the jailor while he was closing the barrack gate during the clash. He had been in Fatehgarh jail since 2017. Official sources told TOI that the manner in which Thakur was injured -- his abdomen was completely ruptured -- and it was suspected that a bullet fired from an AK-47 rifle had hit him from a close range. The riots in the jail on Sunday morning were triggered after inmates learnt about the death of a convicted prisoner, Sandeep Yadav, 28, on November 6. Though police claimed that Yadav died due to dengue, the Saifai hospital administration where he was admitted for treatment, confirmed that his test report for the disease was found “negative”. Yadav, who had been in the district jail since 2012, was sentenced to life in prison in a dowry death case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/jail-riots-inmate-died-as-cops-gun-went-off-after-prisoners-tried-to-snatch-it-claim-police/articleshow/87654036.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Campuses rush to repair damaged devices, wiring||Kolkata: With only three days to go for campuses to reopen, colleges and universities are in a rush to repair electronic equipment and wiring, which have either developed snags or run out of batteries due to long months of disuse. Once the government announced that schools and colleges would reopen for physical classes on November 16, the authorities carried out an audit. With the institutes being shut for almost 20 months, the equipment in laboratories, gadgets in computer rooms and other devices and facilities were found to have broken down as those had not been used much during the campus shutdown. Even as the institutes got down to sanitizing the campuses, drawing up new rosters for in-person classes and checking students’ vaccination status, they drew up a list and started repairs and replacements.  “The UPS batteries died. We got those replaced last week,” said an official at Scottish Church College. “The audit showed all the 16 computers in our computer room required repairs because of lack of maintenance. The college has been shut since March 2020 and nobody has used them ever since,” said the principal of a north Kolkata college. At Asutosh College, too, the authorities have initiated the process to repair and replace broken-down wires and devices. “Yes, we found out that some electronic equipment were in need of repairs. But we are hopeful of completing the process before students come in for physical classes from November 16,” said an official. In the first phase of campus reopening, most colleges and universities in the city have decided to bring in only students pursuing lab-based subjects or those requiring work on computers. Among them, most students will be from older batches, who have not got any practice in practical classes. So, it is important for the colleges that these facilities were ready before the reopening, said an official. “Students with science subjects have missed out on all practical work. So, it is important that we let them come before the others so that they can catch up with the curriculum. Our teachers have finished a large part of theory-based subjects and the portions left would be taught online, as has been happening now. We have cleaned the labs and sanitized them. Repairs and replacements of equipment and instruments in the lab have also been done,” said Swami Kamalasthananda, principal at Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Centenary College, Rahara.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/campuses-rush-to-repair-damaged-devices-wiring/articleshow/87654775.cms||Zeeshan Javed

He said that beneficiaries should get clear title after registration. The chief minister reviewed the progress of Jagananna Sampoorna Gruha Hakku scheme to grant title to beneficiaries of housing schemes through One-Time Settlement (OTS). The state government announced a scheme to clear all dues owned by housing scheme beneficiaries with payment of nominal charges under OTS. During the review meeting held at camp office here on Thursday, the chief minister asked the senior officials to closely monitor the implementation of the scheme from the top. He said that all the applications received under the scheme should be thoroughly scrutinized before routing them for registration. He said that there should not be any legal complications after the registration and the beneficiaries should get clear title. He said that senior officials should verify every application to find out whether field teams scrutinizing the documents as required. “The field level teams roped into conduct the survey and inspection of the documents should have proper knowledge of the subject to clear the application for registration. The field teams could gain proper knowledge over the issue only when the senior officials regularly monitor the implementation of the programme,” said the chief minister. He said that field teams should create awareness among beneficiaries that the OTS will provide clear title to them. “The OTS is not aimed at mopping up revenues to the exchequer. It has been designed to provide clear title to the poor people over the assets which they accrued by securing loans under different government housing schemes,” said the chief minister. Municipal administration and urban development minister, Botcha Satyanarayana, chief secretary Dr. Sameer Sharma, and other officials were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ensure-housing-beneficiaries-get-clear-title-deeds-says-cm/articleshow/87654016.cms||Samdani MN

In a statement, police said that based on instructions from the Madurai district superintendent of police (SP), V Baskaran, the rural cyber crime police looked into cases of stolen/missing mobile phones filed at all police stations in October. A total of 111 stolen mobile phones, most of them smart phones, worth more than Rs 15 lakh were recovered and returned to their owners by Baskaran. Baskaran called for more awareness in reporting instances of lost or stolen mobile phones to the police. “Often, there is a misconception that we cannot find the mobile phones. We similarly recovered 150 mobile phones before. Following it, more people came forward to report to the police,” he said. So far, in 2021, as many as 511 stolen mobile phones worth more than Rs 64 lakh have been recovered by the rural cyber crime police.

---||Madurai||Traffic snarls in Madurai city as key routes shut due to surplus in Vaigai||MADURAI: Surplus water from Vaigai dam that was released on Tuesday night and increased to 3,000 cusecs on Wednesday morning entered Madurai city around 1pm on Thursday. By evening the flow in the river through the city increased to 4,000 cusecs. With the possibility of flooding in the low-lying areas of Madurai, the city police closed the Taraipalam at Simmakkal with barricades. Closure of the bridge to prevent anyone from crossing it resulted in closure of three routes connecting the north and south banks of the Vaigai river, which is integral for the flow of traffic in the city as the Kuruvikaran Salai Bridge and Obula Padithurai Bridge are under construction. This resulted in traffic jams in several areas, especially at Goripalayam junction on Thursday. Vehicles were getting piled up for the entire stretch between Goripalayam Junction and almost up to Yanaikkal bridge. “The nearest way to move back and forth from the south to the north bank now is Yanaikkal bridge and Albert Victor bridge,” said V Ramakrishnan, a resident of Kamarajar Salai. The volume of vehicles crossing Goripalayam is set to increase further due to closure of Taraipalam. “Since both Kuruvikaran Salai and Obula Padithurai are under construction, the Goripalayam Junction is inevitable as it is the easiest route from Anna Nagar. Now, the traffic has increased further and I had to wait for traffic to clear at Goripalayam junction for at least 15 minutes,” said K Darshini a regular commuter through Goripalayam. Police have erected barricades and warnings at many places to prevent people from entering the river. Meanwhile, the outflow from Vaigai dam that was 3,569 cusecs on Wednesday reduced to 3,465 cusecs on Thursday morning and to 3,069 cusecs on Thursday evening, as inflow to the dam reduced without rains in the catchment areas. The 3,069 cusecs include 2,000 cusecs that was let into the river, 1,000 for irrigation through the Mullaperiyar main canal ayacut and 69 cusecs for drinking water in Madurai and Theni. PWD officials said that water discharged from Periyar dam to Vaigai cam that was 1,875 cusecs over the last two days was reduced to 900 cusecs around 12 noon on Thursday. This is expected to influence inflow to Vaigai dam from Friday morning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/traffic-snarls-in-madurai-city-as-key-routes-shut-due-to-surplus-in-vaigai/articleshow/87654772.cms||---

Also, every district will have one Regional Transport Office (RTO) official, a police officer and an MSRTC representative monitoring the activities and helping private bus owners,” Parab said. The private bus operators in Pune on Thursday morning stopped all operations from MSRTC depots, citing security reasons. Private transporters also said while 2,000-odd buses had left various depots in Pune to many districts on Wednesday, 80% of them came back with little to no passengers. “In places such as Kolhapur, Solapur, Parbhani and Nanded, the MSRTC unions are strong. There have been cases in which windscreens of some buses were smashed. The MSRTC and the administration should ensure that such incidents do not occur,” said Baba Shinde, president of the Maharashtra State Goods and Passengers Transport Association. The issue of fares was also on the list. “We are being told to ply passengers for fares at par with MSRTC. But our buses are either luxury or semi-luxury ones and cannot match these fares. We had a meeting on many such issues with Pune RTO officials,” said Prasanna Patwardhan, president of the Bus and Car Operators Confederation of India and chairman-managing director of Prasanna Purple Mobility Solutions Limited. “We have been waiting at Swargate for a bus to Sawantwadi since 5am. The fare per person in private buses is Rs700 and we are eight people in all” said Shobha Giri, a commuter. Around 1:30pm, things began to improve as private buses made their way into MSRTC depots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/private-buses-can-charge-more-will-get-security/articleshow/87654778.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Delhi||No bail to help accused of abducting kid over wages||New Delhi: A Delhi court dismissed the bail plea of a domestic help accused of kidnapping a child to recover her wages from the child’s parents, saying it can, by no stretch of imagination, be a method for the same. Additional Sessions Judge Samar Vishal denied the relief, considering the seriousness of the offence and the fact that she may be a flight risk. “Even if she has kidnapped the child to recover her wages, it can, by no stretch of imagination, be a method for the same. Both sides have counterclaims about whether she demanded wages or more money, which shall be a matter of trial,” the court said in its order. “However, considering the seriousness of the offence, the fact that she may be a flight risk as having no permanent address in Delhi and also the fact that she left her parental house way back in the year 2018 as she did not want to live with her parents, she does not have a prima facie case of bail,” the court further said. As per police, the accused had allegedly fled to Rajasthan with the child after repeatedly demanding the parents pay her wages. Police further claimed that she had sent several messages threatening to kill the child if the parents did not pay the wages. The accused’s counsel had sought bail saying she was the poor and the only breadwinner of her family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-bail-to-help-accused-of-abducting-kid-over-wages/articleshow/87655387.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The Madurai district administration, police and fire and rescue services department officials have warned people against entering the Vaigai river for any purpose especially with the release of water from the Vaigai dam. In the first incident on November 6, V Rajasekar, 30, from Anaikarapatti was visiting his agricultural field and tried to cross the river.  Due to rains, the water flow in the river was around 7ft in depth. He was swept away in the water, following which fire and rescue services department officials carried out a search and recovered his body at Saptur Kanmai on November 7. In another incident, two people K Vishwanathan, 21, and S Vasanth, 20, who had gone to bathe in the Vaigai near Thuvariman bridge on November 6 were swept away in the current. Fire and rescue services personnel recovered their bodies on November 9. Vishwanathan’s body was recovered near Guru Theatre bridge in the city while Vasanth’s body was recovered near Kochadai. In another incident the same day, A Mustaffa, 20, from Virudhunagar who had gone to bathe near Saptur Keni Karai stream with his friends was swept away by flash flood.  The fire and rescue services department officials recovered the body the next day from the river near the same spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/four-drown-in-river-in-past-one-week/articleshow/87654776.cms||---
---||Kolkata||At some Calcutta University colleges, student’s jab certificate will be entry pass||KOLKATA: Students’ vaccination certificates may be treated as entry passes at a few colleges in the city when campuses reopen on November 16. Those institutes have asked the students to submit their vaccination certificates before going in for their on-campus classes. Calcutta University-affiliated colleges, such as Loreto, Maulana Azad, Asutosh and Scottish Church, are some of the institutes which have taken this step for “safety purpose”. Heads of the departments have been given the responsibility of circulating the message among their students. Loreto College has formed a Covid Care Committee and Covid Sanitization and Fumigation Committee to ensure safety measures are maintained. Third and fifth-semester undergraduate students and those in MA and BEd will attend on-campus classes from November 16. “Soft copies of Covid vaccination certificates of students arriving on the campus will be received by the HoDs. The college is taking all precautions to ensure a safe environment and will review the modalities 10 days later,” said principal Christine Coutinho. But New Alipore College will not ask students to show vaccination certificate immediately, but once they start attending classes, the authorities will collect their details and build a database. Principal Jaydeep Sarangi said, “Once we have details of their vaccination status, we can arrange for a vaccination camp for those who are yet to get their second dose or even the first.” Even Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira officials said they would help their students get their second doses. “Most of our students have received both the doses of vaccine, but some are yet to get their second ones. We will help students coming to the campus get their second doses, if required,” said Swami Mahaprajnanada, vice-principal at the college. When the higher education department had published a guideline on campus reopening, it had not mentioned anything about students’ vaccination. Some college authorities have decided not to call freshers to the campus immediately as many of them—close to 30% of them—might still be below 18 years and may not have received their vaccines yet. “If we call those unvaccinated youngsters to the campus, we will put them at risk. The government should have spelt out the norm on this issue,” said the principal of a south Kolkata college. Like at Loreto, heads of the departments at Scottish Church will collect the soft copies of vaccination certificates of UG third and fifth semesters who will go to college after November 16. At least one dose is a must for attending physical classes. “A vaccination camp was arranged. It is expected third and fifth-semester students would have at least one dose. Without it, no one will be allowed to attend on-campus classes,” said vice-principal Supratim Das. Asutosh College and Maulana Azad have taken a similar decision. “All classes have their WhatsApp groups. Over there, students have been told to show their vaccination certificates when they enter the college,” said an Asutosh College official. Maulana Azad principal Subhasis Dutta said, “Students have to submit vaccination certificates and consent letters from their parents before stepping into campuses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/at-some-cu-colleges-students-jab-certificate-will-be-entry-pass/articleshow/87654783.cms||Zeeshan Javed

In the meeting, UT adviser Dharam Pal and other senior officers will put up UT’s longpending issues, like conversion of properties from leasehold to freehold and building misuse charges. Sources said the minister will also review UT’s functioning and Central government schemes. The Chandigarh administration had recently written to the MHA for in-principle nod for conversion of leasehold properties to freehold in the commercial and Industrial Area, phases I and II. Thereafter, Dharam Pal had also met MHA officers and raised this demand. The UT administration had last converted leasehold plots into freehold in 1983 in the commercial category. The matter was also taken up by MP Kirron Kher with the MHA and the ministry of urban development (MoUD). It was the long-pending demand of the industrialists too. Recently, the UT administration had even conducted a survey in the Industrial Area for checking leasehold plots. The administration had set up phases I and II of the Industrial Area during the 1970s on 147 acres. The plots are governed by zoning and architectural control, prepared as per the conditions prevailing at that time. There are 1,884 plots in both phases, of which 700 are of one kanal and above, and 443 and 180 plots measuring 10 and 15 marlas, respectively. There are 381 plots of five marlas. If the MHA allowed conversion of plots, it will have an impact on around 1,200 units. The administration had recently sought a report of violations in industrial plots, including leasehold and freehold. The report was prepared by the estate office and put up before a committee formed by the UT administration to address the demands of the industrialists. Thereafter, certain needbased changes in the architectural controls, in accordance with modern day industrial requirements, were allowed. The UT had even allowed that cycle stand can be used for storage of raw material and other purposes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/citys-long-pending-issues-to-come-up-before-mha-today/articleshow/87654781.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

He also said that the ED was “most welcome to visit or raid” his home and that he was “not scared,” ED could “send him to jail.” Speaking to mediapersons, Mali said, “Reports saying ED raids Waqf Board offices and is all set to reach the residence of Malik are false and baseless. In the larger public interest, ED should issue a statement on the raids to halt kite-flying.” Malik said while he himself has taken a series of measures to clean up the Waqf Board, he would suggest to ED to initiate a probe into 30,000-odd trusts transferred to the Waqf Board by the state charity commissioner. “ED should join us in cleansing the Waqf Board and enhance steps taken by me,” Malik said. Malik said his information was that the ED had on Thursday raided the premises of the Pune-based Tabut Inam Endowment Trust in connection with a land deal. “The Waqf Board lodged a complaint with the Bund Garden police station. ED raided the trust’s office following the FIR lodged by the Waqf Board. So far, five persons have been arrested in the case. In addition, the Waqf Board has lodged criminal cases against seven trusts across the state,” he said. In the Tabut Inam Endowment Trust case, Malik said it was found that MIDC had acquired land worth Rs 9.64 crore on December 11, 2020. One Imtiaz Hussain and his colleagues secured compensation of Rs 7.76 crore for the land on the basis of a forged NOC. After the fraud was detected, the Waqf Board CEO cancelled the entire deal and a criminal case was filed with the police on August 13 this year. Along with the Tabut trust, offences have been registered against Jumma Masjid, Thane, Darga Masjid, Beed, Majeed Devi, Beed, Darga Burhan, Parbhani, Majjit Chhota, Jalna and Darga Nurul, Aurangabad, he said. Malik claimed ever since he took over reins of the minority affairs department, he has launched a clean-up operation. “Don’t be surprised if a top BJP leader is arrested for his alleged involvement in an illegal land deal,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-waqf-office-raided-but-am-not-scared-of-ed-says-malik/articleshow/87655827.cms||---

Taking a serious note of the circular issued by Palamaneru deputy superintendent of police (DSP), the high court observed that the notices issued by the DSP are reflecting the prevailing situation in the state. Palameru DSP stated in his notice that a prior permission from the police is required to campaign in Kuppam and failing which action will initiated under the Police Act. Challenging the notices issued by the Palamaneru DSP, two contesting candidates from TDP moved the high court with a lunch motion petition seeking urgent hearing. Arguing on behalf of the petitioners, advocates Ginjipalli Subba Rao and Posani Venkateswarlu told the high court that issuing such notices is illegal. Campaigning in elections is the right of any individual guaranteed by the Constitution. The counsels for the petitioners further argued that the police are allowing the ruling party functionaries to campaign without any restrictions and obstructing the opposition workers from campaigning. They have said that four TDP functionaries including former ministers were detained by the police for participating in election campaign. Considering the arguments of the petitioner counsels, Justice D Ramesh stayed the notice issued by the DSP. He observed that when the election commission itself has not imposed any restrictions on campaigning, how the police issued such notices. Justice Ramesh further said that now the police are asking to take permission for campaigning and in future they might ask for their permission to file nominations also. The high court directed the Chittoor district SP to seek an explanation from the DSP and submit a report to the court. The high court further directed not to obstruct anyone from participating in election campaign and posted the matter for further hearing on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-stays-dsp-diktat-against-tdp-hustings/articleshow/87654032.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The incident took place in Nainital’s Tok Nartola village on November 2 but came to light later. The fish-seller, Bhagwan Singh Padiyar, died on Wednesday after battling for life for eight days in a Haldwani hospital. The four accused have been arrested. The revenue police, which looks after law and order in hill villages, has registered a case of murder against Chanchal Singh, Khushal Singh, Sunil Joshi and Bhupal Singh on a complaint by Bhagwan Singh's uncle, Ganesh Singh. The case would be transferred to regular police after the revenue police concludes its probe, district magistrate Dhiraj Garbiyal told TOI. Padiyar used to run a fish shop in Tok Nartola village. His relatives said he was closing his shop on November 2 at about 7 pm, when the four local men came to buy fish but refused to pay for the same. An argument ensued as Bhagwan Singh refused to relent. They then allegedly attacked him with a rod and a sharp-edged weapon, gouging his eyes out, blinding him. They thereafter dragged him to the roof of a house, threw him down and fled. He was later taken to a private hospital in Haldwani, where he swung between life and death, finally succumbing to his injuries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/fish-sellers-eyes-gouged-out-pushed-from-two-storey-building-for-not-giving-free-fish-dies-after-battling-for-life-for-8-days-4-arrested/articleshow/87654035.cms||---

The field was moist and shone with a tinge of green. Up against the novices was Chandigarh, whose new-ball bowlers were expected to exploit the seam-friendly conditions. They did, and were off to a flying start with a wicket in the bag as the fourth ball swung in dangerously. Then Anju Tomar took guard. She hit 16 boundaries, scored a swashbuckling, unbeaten 124 and ran to hug her girls. The captain of the Uttarakhand team had steered the ship home and steadied the innings like she often does. Outside the arena, though, the tribal girl who lives in a leaky house with a tin shed on the margins of Dehradun -- pots and pans hold off water from flooding the house when it rains -- says she feels like she's losing control of her "shaky life".

---||Pune||Pune civic body to seek more water as consumption on the up||PUNE: The civic body will seek additional water from the state irrigation department on the grounds that the merger of 23 villages and an ease in Covid-19 restrictions have caused an increase in consumption. The Pune Municipal Corporation had asked for a total of 18.58 thousand million cubic feet (TMC) of water per year to meet the increasing needs of residents in its jurisdiction. Civic officials said the floating population has increased after the restrictions were eased, and that the needs of businesses and commercial establishments have increased as they have started functioning at full capacity. “We had raised the demand for more water in the past but did not get it. The administration will again urge the irrigation department for additional water, as the consumption has increased,” said Aniruddha Pawaskar, head of PMC’s water supply department. He said PMC will send a letter in this regard to irrigation department. “The merger process has been carried out; the population has increased and so has demand,” he said. “The consumption had gone down during the lockdown. Many citizens and students had gone to their native places due to closure of offices and educational institutes,” said a senior official of PMC. Now he said majority of this population has returned, adding to the demand. “Nearly 1 to 2 TMC more water is likely to be consumed in the civic areas, including in the merged villages. This demand should be considered, and more water should be given to PMC,” the official said. “PMC should make sure that it plans water supply. The distribution network should be strengthened so that water losses can be reduced. The water supplied to PMC from Khadakwasla dam should be used judiciously,” said a senior official from the state irrigation department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-to-seek-more-water-as-consumption-on-the-up/articleshow/87654796.cms||---

The electric buses initially will ply Sector 43-Sector17-PGI route. Recently, Purohit had asked the administration to ensure arrival of 40 electric buses by December-end. The directions were issued after the UT administrator’s advisory council’s sub-committee on transport issues submitted their action-taken report. A senior UT official said the remaining 28 electric buses are expected to reach Chandigarh by December. Recently, the Centre had sanctioned 40 additional electric buses for Chandigarh, which makes a total of 80 electric buses for the city. As per the earlier arrangement, the city was to receive a fleet of 19 electric buses on September 30 and remaining 20 by October-end, but the manufacturer expressed its inability to supply the buses by the scheduled date. The first electric bus had hit the UT roads on August 11. After completion of a month-long trial run, the transport department had asked the manufacturer to make some technical changes in the bus. Three companies had submitted bids to run 40 electric buses. The lowest bidder, Ashok Leyland, was awarded the contract to run the environment-friendly buses for 10 years on the basis of km scheme. As per the agreement, all maintenance expenditure, bus charging stations, suspension, HVAC system and major and minor repair of the buses during the contract period would be the responsibility of the successful bidder. The department will pay Rs 60 per km to the company. The fare collection will be done by the authority. After being charged, the bus will cover a distance of nearly 200-300 km and will take two to three hours to fully charge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/purohit-to-flag-off-first-batch-of-13-electric-buses-tomorrow/articleshow/87654801.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The bench of Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice AS Bopanna, while expressing serious concern about the alleged overcharging by hospitals, issued notices to all states and Union Territories as well. They, too, have been asked to respond within four weeks. The matter came up for hearing on November 8 and the order was made available on Thursday. Last month, as reported by TOI, the SC bench comprising Justices Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna had sought a reply from the Centre on this issue. Thapar had in October started a campaign to collect copies of hospital bills from families who had been charged excessively. “In 2020, the central government, in view of overcharging by private hospitals, had set a cap on charges for different medical facilities. For instance, a private facility could not charge a Covid-19 patient above Rs 10,000 per day for an oxygen bed. Similarly, the charges for ICU and ventilator beds were capped at Rs 15,000 and Rs 18,000 per day respectively,” he said. He added that “during the second wave, many people were admitted to private hospitals because of a lack of proper public health system and forced to pay exorbitant hospital bills...Many families exhausted almost all their financial resources to settle their bills. Our battle is to ensure that they get refunded.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/when-will-people-overcharged-by-hosps-for-covid-cure-get-refund-sc-asks-centre-issues-notices-to-states-uts/articleshow/87654059.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||State on high alert as heavy rains wreak havoc in south coastal dists||Guntur/Tirupati: The state government has put the district administrations in Prakasam, Nellore, Chittoor and Kadapa districts on high alert as heavy rains lashed parts of Rayalaseema and south coastal Andhra, affecting normal life and inundating low-lying areas. All streams and rivulets are overflowing even as the depression over the Bay of Bengal crossed the coast near Chennai on Thursday night. The Met department has forecast another low pressure area in the Bay of Bengal around November 17. Meanwhile, the northeast monsoon that brings in maximum rainfall in Rayalaseema and south coastal Andhra is still active. Power supply was hit at several places due to trees falling on power lines. Local authorities declared a holiday for educational institutions in the affected areas on Thursday. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, who took stock of the situation with district collectors of the affected districts through video conference, directed officials to be on high alert to tackle the situation. Asking the district administration to take the help of NDRF wherever their services are required, he asked them to set up relief camps to provide shelter and food to flood victims. He also announced an immediate relief of Rs 1,000 for each of them. “There should not be any laxity in providing relief. The collectors should take all required measures to handle the situation,” he said. He also asked officials to start a toll-free number to provide emergency assistance to affected people. “All departments should coordinate with each other to tackle the situation. Senior officials must monitor the situation 24x7 till the rain threat eases. Evacuate people from low-lying areas to safe zones and provide them proper shelter and food. Doctors and paramedical staff should be made available in PHCs, area and district hospitals. Joint collectors should monitor situation in hospitals,” he added. The CM also wanted generators to be kept ready in hospitals to handle emergencies in case of interruption to power supply. Chittoor district bore the brunt of the rain’s fury, triggering flood-like situation in Tirupati, Srikalahasti, Satyavedu, Varadaiahpalem, and Nagari-Puttur regions as most water bodies, lakes, streams and rivulets overflowed. As many as eight flights scheduled at Tirupati airport were cancelled. The temple city remained deserted as non-stop downpour since Wednesday morning brought life to a standstill. Waterlogging was reported in several low-lying areas of the city. All the reservoirs in Tirumala, including Papavinasanam, Gogarbham, Akasaganga and Kumaradhara-Pasupudhara dams reached full reservoir levels, forcing TTD officials to lift the crest gates of all the dams to release water downstream. Swarnamukhi, Bheema, Kushastali and other rivers in the district were in full spate due to heavy rains in the catchment areas. Vehicular traffic was also stalled at several places on the ghat road and in Tirumala due to landslides and uprooted trees falling on the roads. The hill town received 10cm rainfall in just a few hours. The AP southern power distribution company limited has set up control rooms across five districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/state-on-high-alert-as-heavy-rains-wreak-havoc-in-south-coastal-dists/articleshow/87654048.cms||Samdani MN

In her death too, Minakshi Rana gave a new lease of life to a few. The 41-year-old zari unit employee’s organs were harvested after she was declared brain-dead on Thursday. Rana succumbed to the head injuries she suffered in a road accident on November 9. Rana along with her husband Anil and son Krishna was going to a temple when their motorcycle met with an accident near Bardoli. Rana’s kidneys, liver and two eyes were harvested by doctors after she was declared brain-dead by the doctors at INS Hospital here. The kidneys and liver were transplanted to patients in Ahmedabad while Rana’s eyes were collected by a local eye bank. “The organs would have turned into ashes if not donated. Hence all our family members agreed on organ donation. A part of my wife will be alive in future too,” said Anil, also a zari unit employee. Donate Life, an NGO working for organ donation awareness, coordinated the donation and also convinced the family. “The family members were kind enough to agree and donate the organs of a young family member who died sudden death due to an unfortunate accident,” said Nilesh Mandlewala, president of Donate Life. The Rana family was travelling to Mahua to visit Vighneshwar Dada temple on the fateful day. “A woman was driving a moped just ahead of us. She was talking on her mobile phone while driving. Her moped slipped as there was paint spilled on the road in front of a shop on the Surat-Bardoli highway. As our bike was just behind her we too fell on the road,” Anil told TOI. Rana’s head banged on the road and she lost consciousness. She was initially admitted to a hospital in Bardoli and later shifted to Surat’s INS Hospital as her condition turned critical.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/zari-makers-organs-add-sparkle-to-many-lives/articleshow/87654194.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Charges framed against AAP legislator Prakash Jarwal in doctor suicide case||NEW DELHI: A court on Thursday framed charges of criminal conspiracy, abetment to suicide and criminal intimidation against AAP legislator Prakash Jarwal in connection with a case of alleged suicide of a doctor in south Delhi in April last year. Special judge Geetanjli Goel said prima facie it seemed the accused persons, Jarwal and Kapil Nagar, had created such circumstances that the deceased was left with no option but to die by suicide, more so as his source of livelihood was also affected. Dr Rajendra Singh (52) allegedly died by suicide in Durga Vihar on April 18, 2020. In his alleged suicide note, the doctor held MLA Jarwal responsible for his death. Like Jarwal, Singh was also involved in the business of water supply with Delhi Jal Board since 2007, and police alleged Jarwal and his associates were extorting money from other tanker owners, including the doctor. A case of alleged extortion and abetment to suicide was filed. The court said offences under IPC Section 120B (criminal conspiracy) read with sections 386 (extortion by putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt), 384 (punishment for extortion) and 506 (criminal intimidation), 306 (abetment to suicide), 34 (common intention) were prima facie made out against Jarwal and Nagar. It, however, only framed charges of criminal intimidation against Haris. “From the material on record, it can be said Prakash Jarwal and Kapil Nagar had hatched a conspiracy to extort the tanker owners and the deceased by threatening them to pay money if they wanted to ply their tankers with Delhi Jal Board and further demand was raised at the time of elections of Delhi Legislative Assembly in 2020... and the said accused persons also threatened to kill the deceased and his family members,” the court observed. The court further said sufficient material prima facie showed that Jarwal and Nagar had allegedly extorted the deceased and other tanker owners who, in their statements, had also stated about the extortion — Rs 15,000 for small tankers and Rs 20,000 for big tankers monthly. The accused reportedly demanded Rs 51,000 for small tankers and Rs 71,000 for big tankers at the time of the 2020 elections, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/charges-framed-against-jarwal-in-doc-suicide-case/articleshow/87655409.cms||Usha Das

Local residents said Pali also routinely hurled filthy abuses at the bovines, much to the discomfort of women in the neighbourhood. "He (Pali) uttered filthy language to the cows with sexual colour, especially when he saw women passing by," said a local resident. It's learnt some 32 families of Parvati Nagar have been fighting a grim battle to oust the cowshed, which has turned into a nuisance, from the locality. Despite approaching several agencies, including police, the residents could not find any solution for last several years. Recently, the residents, through an animal activist, handed over some CCTV footage of the cruelty by Pali towards the bovines to Ajni police, which booked the man. Residents claim Pali had been mercilessly thrashing the bovines. One of the CCTV cameras installed at a house in the vicinity of the cowshed had caught Pali raining blows on one of the bovines. In other footage, Pali can be seen pushing an injection into a calf, which became one of the grounds for the FIR lodged against him on the complaint of animal activist Anjali Vaidyar, committee member of Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA). Vaidyar said local residents were petrified to see heads and tails of calves hanging outside Pali's residence. "Some residents have observed that the cowshed owner would inject some materials into the calves, after which they would probably die," she said. "Even if it's a drug, only a veterenarian can administer such injections," she said. According to a local woman, Pali may also have butchered dead cows and calves for slaughterhouses. "He (Pali) keeps on torturing animals from 5am onwards till late evening," she said.

While the government ruled out any possibility of reducing the taxes citing that the state has not increased the taxes for the last five years and reducing the taxes now would mean that it will not be left with any revenue, the opposition demanded that the government should reduce a portion of taxes and provide fuel subsidy to autorickshaw, taxis, transport buses and fishermen so that they get more relief in addition to the reduction of fuel prices by the Centre. Before the commencement of Thursday’s assembly session, the opposition MLAs led by opposition leader V D Satheesan took out a bicycle rally to the assembly from the MLA quarters. “Though the Centre reduced only a meagre portion of the taxes that it has been increasing, the state also should reduce the taxes so as to provide more relief to the public as it had earned approximately Rs 5,000 crore through sale of petrol and diesel in the last five years. The Centre and the state government are practising tax terrorism over the public and the state government is rejoicing when the Centre is increasing the taxes on petrol and diesel,” he said. He said that former finance minister T M Thomas Isaac had said that the government will reduce the tax if the Centre reduces it. But when the Centre reduced it, the present state finance minister is making excuses by saying that the Congress governments in Rajasthan and Punjab have not reduced anything. Now that those governments also have reduced, the state should immediately reduce the taxes, he said. Finance minister K N Balagopal, however, said that the government has not only increased the taxes on petrol and diesel in the last six years, it had reduced the taxes three years ago. As 41% of the excise duty being collected has to be shared with the states, the Centre is collecting the major portion of the taxes as special excise duty and cess, which need not be shared with the states. The state had also not imposed any Covid-19 cess on fuels like many other states did during the pandemic, he said. Moreover, the state has not compromised on any of the social security commitments and welfare activities being undertaken by it. If the taxes are slashed further, the state will be hardly left with any revenue, he said. The opposition members then shouted slogans in front of the speaker’s dais, demanding that the government reduce the fuel taxes. The UDF members later boycotted the assembly protesting the government not heeding to their demands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/opposition-takes-out-cycle-rally-protest-over-fuel-tax/articleshow/87654084.cms||---

Since the engineering department of the civic body has to complete the process, it is checking the documents of the company and making a report to send to the higher authorities for allotment.Two companies had participated in the bid to run the C&D waste plant mechanically, out of which an Ahmedabad-based one quoted the lowest amount for this first-of-its-kind project. “Since we require some more details, documents of the company are being checked for the final allotment,” sources said.“UT adviser Dharam Pal will lay the stone of the project on Wednesday. We have planned things minutely and since the adviser is keeping an eye on this project, senior officers will monitor its working and progress,” a senior officer said.The draft rules of the construction and demolition waste policy were with the UT administration earlier, but now these are with the MC for some amendments aiming to reuse 100% waste. The charges, transportation modes—private or government—everything will be finalised after receiving objections and suggestions from the public. The authorities are aiming not only at the C&D waste of Chandigarh, but also of Panchkula and Mohali.After processing the raw material, the machines will produce recycled aggregates such as stones, gravel, and mix of debris to make concrete and related material. The recycled concrete can be used to make tiles, kerb channels, and paver blocks, which the MC uses in different works. Silt, which is one of the by-products, can be used as filler at construction sites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/guj-firm-offers-lowest-bid-to-mechanically-run-cd-waste-plant/articleshow/87654810.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Mumbai||Ex-Maharashtra CM Devendra's wife & mantri’s daughter in notice spat||MUMBAI: After NCP minister Nawab Malik and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis traded charges, a legal battle appears to have begun between the members of their families. The ex-CM’s wife, Amruta, on Thursday issued a legal notice to Malik for alleging they had links with drug peddlers, while Malik’s daughter Nilofer on Thursday served a notice to Fadnavis for stating Malik’s son-in-law Sameer Khan was found with drugs in his possession. On November 1, Malik had tweeted some photographs of Devendra and Amruta Fadnavis with Jaideep Rana and claimed Rana was a known drug peddler and currently in jail custody under the NDPS Act. Fadnavis had then stated that Malik’s son-in-law Sameer Khan was found with drugs in his possession. Amruta Fadnavis asked Malik to remove the “defamatory tweets” within 48 hours and tender an unconditional apology to her, also within 48 hours. Nilofer, on the other hand, asked Fadnavis to tender an unconditional apology for making “baseless allegations” against her husband and pay Rs 5 crore on account of the “mental torture, agony, financial loss and injury inflicted (sic) to his reputation within 15 days.” Fadnavis’s wife pointed out that Malik’s tweets were defamatory in nature. “My client is an Indian banker, singer and social activist having huge reputation in the field, and her husband is a leader of opposition and former Chief Minister, a philanthropist, who is actively involved in politics for the sole purpose of uplifting the downtrodden. The defamatory tweets have resulted in tarnishing the image of Amruta Fadnavis and her family at large,” her notice said. “Malik’s tweets suggest that my client has connection with the drug peddlers. Malik’s entire press conference was uploaded on his Twitter handle. Malik made baseless allegations, and it was done for cheap political mileage and with the sole intention to divert attention from misrule and failure of the MVA government. The photographs were clicked during an event organized for conservation of rivers. It was four years ago. Rana was hired by organizers of the event,” she said. Nilofer stated, “The allegations are baseless and without any merits. The chargesheet filed by the NCB does not support a single allegation levelled by Fadnavis. The panchanama dated January 14 clearly says the house was searched and no contraband/suspicious substance was found in my house or under his possession.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ex-cms-wife-mantris-daughter-in-notice-spat/articleshow/87655837.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Housing Board plans PPP mode for hospital at IT Park||CHANDIGARH: The Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) is planning to go for public private partnership (PPP) model for the auction of 8.23-acre site for a hospital at Rajiv Gandhi Chandigarh Technology Park (RGCTP). The board had recently written to the UT deputy commissioner’s office and sought clarification on collector rates of different categories, like residential, commercial, for the hospital site. Sources said CHB officials believed that private parties would not come forward for the auction of leasehold site and that too at higher rates. Therefore, the officials planned to go for PPP mode and the board has already studied the model of different states and union territories (UTs). The hospital site was put to auction with the reserve price of Rs 344 crore in September 2017, but despite many extensions, there was no response from bidders, as it was a leasehold property. In October 2006, the CHB had decided to develop residential and commercial properties on 123 acres at 20 sites and transferred the land to Parsvnath Developers at IT Park. However, the project could not materialise and applicants started demanding their money back. The builder had then approached the court. In January 2015, the arbitrator appointed by the apex court directed the board to refund Rs 567 crore to the builder, following which the land was transferred back to the CHB. The board then decided to construct around 1,000 flats on two sites itself, while the remaining 18 sites were to be auctioned to a builder or developer. The board had proposed to come up with a hospital on 8.23 acres, a school on 4.5 acres and residential plots on 4.55 acres. Both the school and the hospital sites are on leasehold, while residential site is on freehold. Poor response:In the recent auction, the board had witnessed poor response to its 163 leasehold properties, including commercial and residential, and 28 residential freehold properties. Out of 191 properties, CHB was able to auction only 32, including nine residential freehold, four residential leasehold and 19 commercial leasehold. Last time the board had even reduced the reserve price: commercial units on leasehold by 20% and residential units on leasehold by 10%. Nursing homes in residential areas:The UT administration’s health panel had recently submitted a report on opening of nursing homes in the residential areas to administrator Banwari Lal Purohit. Backed by MP Kirron Kher, the UT, in September, had unveiled the draft order for opening of nursing homes in residential areas and invited suggestions and objections. Sources said the administration has received around 10 objections and suggestions. E-auction of nursing homes’ sites:The UT finance department had recently given its clearance to the estate office for e-auction of six sites of nursing homes. Earlier, the UT estate office had written to the UT finance department to grant permission for eauction of these sites and to clarify terms and conditions for it. Sources in the UT estate office said the reserve price of these sites will be finalised as per collector rates of the area. They are targeting to complete the process within a month, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chb-plans-ppp-mode-for-hospital-at-it-park/articleshow/87654814.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Launched in October 2018, the Tamil Nadu System for Multi-Hazard Potential Impact Assessment, Alert, Emergency Response planning and tracking (TN-SMART) app would also help the disaster management authority to plan appropriate response measures to prevent loss of lives and damage to properties in each area based on the weather forecast. The app would also help generate a database of people who are ready to help government officials with rescue work during disasters. An official said, “There is an option on the app to enrol as volunteers. We need public co-operation during the cyclone, flood and other disasters for rescue work. We cannot identify the right people for rescue work during the emergency. So, we are requesting people to download the app and register their names, address and other details.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/officials-ask-public-to-use-tn-smart-app/articleshow/87655408.cms||---

ADR, an NGO which works in the area of electoral and political reforms, said the total income of the regional parties from unknown sources stood at Rs 446 crore, which is 55 per cent of their total income in 2019-20.

---||Vijayawada||HC allows convenor quota admissions||VIJAYAWADA: The AP high court on Thursday allowed the state government to complete degree admissions pertaining to the seats under convenor quota. The high court reserved the orders pertaining to the seats to be filled under management quota. The high court modified the earlier interim orders passed in the issue. Rayalaseema Degree Colleges Association and Mala Mahanadu moved the high court with separate petitions challenging the GO 55 issued by the state government to fill up the seats through web options for both convenor and management quota seats. Arguing on behalf of the petitioners, senior counsels P Veera Reddy and Vedula Venkata Ramana told the high court that taking control over management quota seats is against the rights of the college managements. They have said that the students will be at the receiving end as the state government is not willing to extend welfare schemes to those students who get seats in management quota because of which they will end up paying three times more fee. As the admission process was stalled because of the pending litigation, they sought urgent directions from the high court. The government pleader for higher education P Raghuveer argued that the state government has taken a policy decision to bring all colleges under a single window system. He said the decision was taken in the best interest of the students and the petitions are not maintainable. Considering the arguments on both sides, the high court bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra and Justice M Satyanarayana Murthy observed that the state government through a legislation is trying to take over aided educational institutions. While directing the government to continue online admissions for 70% of convenor quota seats as usual, the HC reserved orders pertaining to admissions for management quota seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-allows-convenor-quota-admissions/articleshow/87654088.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Masked man steals 2.25kg silver from Sector 23 temple||CHANDIGARH: A masked burglar stole 2.25kg silver from Pracheen Shiva Temple in Sector 23 early on Thursday. The temple president, Dinesh Sharma, said, “The incident came to light when priests Jagdish and Phool Badan went to open the temple and found the lock of Shivalaya broken around 4.30am. The priests informed the temple committee members about it. When they checked, they found a silver sheet weighing around 2.25kg missing from the Shivalaya. However, donation boxes and jewellery in other rooms were intact.” Two sewadars were sleeping in the temple at the time, but they did not hear anything. Police have recorded the statements of priests and members of the temple committee and collected fingerprints of the suspect and other evidence from the spot. There are eight CCTV cameras on the premises. The footage showed a masked man in his 40s entered the temple by scaling a boundary wall around 2.40am and broke the latch of the Shivalaya with an iron rod. He then turned a CCTV camera to the other side and fled after stealing the silver sheet at 3.15am. Sharma said it was the second theft in the temple in the past seven years. Sector 17 police have registered a case. On November 10, thieves had stolen cash and gold jewellery worth Rs 15 lakh from the house of a retired inspector of customs department after breaking the locks of the main door of his house in Sector 51.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/masked-man-steals-2-25kg-silver-from-sector-23-temple/articleshow/87654816.cms||---
---||Kochi||CAG report lays bare state’s lack of preparedness during floods||Thiruvananthapuram: A report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) on the ‘preparedness and response to floods in Kerala’ tabled in the assembly on Thursday, has found that the state’s water policy of 2008 has not been updated in accordance with the national water policy and it lacked provision for flood control and flood management. It also found that the flood plains of the state are yet to be demarcated and flood plain zoning legislation remains to be enacted. The report said that no large-scale flood hazard map is available in the state and the state’s disaster management plan includes flood susceptibility map not in conformation with the Central Water Commission (CWC) criteria for flood-prone area. Only six rain gauges against the requirement of 32 gauges (as per existing BIS norms) were available for rainfall estimation in Periyar basin. Also, the project for obtaining real time data on rainfall, streamflow, etc. did not deliver reliable data on real time basis even after a lapse of five years. In respect of reservoirs under the control of the water resources department, though siltation studies had revealed significant levels of siltation in Aruvikkara reservoir (43%), Mangalam reservoir (21.98%), Peppara reservoir (21.70%), desiltation activities were yet to take off other than in Mangalam reservoir, which commenced in December 2020. The land use and land cover analysis for the entire Periyar basin, including the test-checked districts of Idukki and Ernakulam, revealed an increase in the built-up area by nearly 450% during 1985-2015 and decrease in water bodies by nearly 17%. Continuing presence of encroachments on Cheruthoni river bed obstructed the free flow of the river resulting in damages during the 2018 floods, the report added. Despite passage of 20 years since the commissioning of the international airport at Kochi and instances of severe flooding in the area, the irrigation, revenue and disaster management wings, the local bodies concerned and the Cial have not been able to ensure a well-maintained diversion canal adequate to carry the Chengalthodu waters (in the event of heavy flooding) into the Periyar river to sustain the overall hydrology of the area and ward off the potential risks of riverine flooding to the resident population. Lower than targeted dredging to deepen and widen the leading channel of Thottapally spillway coupled with the presence of over 500 trees planted inside the spillway mouth resulted in reduction of spillway capacity, contributing to the flood situation in Alappuzha in August 2018, the report said. Though 7,124 works of immediate repair and restoration of damages in 2018 flood were approved for execution under the state disaster response fund, 18% of the works were yet to be completed even after a lapse of two years and eight months (till April 2021), the report found.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cag-report-lays-bare-states-lack-of-preparedness-during-floods/articleshow/87654095.cms||---

The state government has given a nod to use its land for construction of this route, which will also give relief to commuters from Sangamwadi to Tingrenagar road. Better management of traffic in the Vishrantwadi areas will be possible after this thoroughfare is completed. “It was a long-pending demand that this road should be built soon. The unavailability of land had created obstacles in starting the ground works for the road. But now, an important section will come up for construction,” Siddharth Dhende, a corporator of the area, told TOI. According to Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) data, the road patch pending completion is around 20 metres in length. Of this, some 5m goes falls under the Survey of India offices, while 15m goes from the Balgram children’s recreation centre. The land was under the possession of the district administration. This district collector’s office had sent a proposal in the matter to the state government for final approval earlier. Now, around 2,610sqm of land will be handed over to PMC. According to the state government’s notification, the land will be given to PMC, but any damages caused to compounds of institutions along the road will be compensated by the civic body as well. The reconstruction of the compound walls will also be done by PMC. The PMC standing committee has made a provision of funds for construction of this road in its municipal budget, keeping aside Rs 2 crore to complete the project at the earliest. “It is an important route for the Nagar road areas. This move will give major relief to traffic, including two-, three- and four-wheeler riders,” said Sunil Tingre, an MLA from the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-allows-use-of-land-for-pending-yerawada-road-work/articleshow/87654823.cms||---

In its chargesheet filed before Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Arun Kumar Garg on November 7, the police, however, stated investigation had established that accused Anil Sharma, Sandeep and Deepak Kashyap allegedly instigated the unlawful assembly to kill complainant Mohammad Salman and entered his house forcibly. In the FIR, six complaints were clubbed together into a single case. During investigation into the allegations by Salman, his and his family members’ statements were recorded. The chargesheet said, according to these witnesses, on February 25, 2020, they were present at their house when a mob of about 100-150 people, allegedly including the six accused people, had gathered near his house. It further stated that the witnesses alleged that Kashyap, Sandeep and Sharma exhorted and instigated the mob. “As a result of this instigation, 8-10 people, including the accused, forcibly entered his house. He (Salman) also alleged Sharma and Sandeep had set his bike on fire...,” it said. The police further said that investigation has established that all the accused people are residents of the same area. “It is also submitted that on the basis of observation by Vinod Kumar ASJ (Additional Sessions Judge) in his order dated 14. 07. 2021, sections 395 and 307 IPC were added in this case. In addition, in view of the facts that as per allegations accused people were also carrying deadly weapons, Section 397 IPC was also added in the case. However, during investigation, no evidence has come on record, which may substantiate commission of offence under these sections of law,” the chargesheet claimed. With respect to the other complaints that were clubbed, the police claimed that none of them was present when their respective properties were alleged to be damaged. “Despite efforts, no witness could be traced/identified who might have witnessed that incident reported by these people,” the chargesheet further claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/charge-of-attempt-to-murder-against-6-riot-accused-dropped/articleshow/87655414.cms||Usha Das

---||Hyderabad||Flying to the US? Get ready to pay a bomb||HYDERABAD: One-way flight ticket costs to various destinations in the US have skyrocketed to Rs 1.50 lakh ever since the country opened its borders for all vaccinated travellers. The Covid-19 pandemic had prompted the US government to close its borders to international travellers from many countries, including India and finally opened up on November 8. Now with relatives planning to reconnect with their loved ones after more than a year’s separation, airlines ticket prices have gone up. According to travel industry data, a return ticket to the US until October was between Rs 87,000 and Rs 1.02 lakh. A return ticket to places such as Chicago, New York and Washington have all doubled and the costs have skyrocketed to Rs 3 lakh. Business class tickets, which were available for Rs 3.97 lakh until a few days back, are now being sold at Rs 6 lakh. Airline sources said people are scrambling for seats with all flights going full. “With limited seats available, these are being now offered at premium prices. Earlier cancelled seats are now being sold at higher prices,” said a senior airline official operating flights to the US. Agrees Siraj Ansari, owner of Avion Holidays that the prices are exorbitantly higher this time around. “Considering many people are browsing for the same destinations and flights, the prices on the online portals have been jacked up. The airlines have got a hint of the high demand following which they have surged the prices,” he said. “Despite this, those who want to travel are still willing to pay the huge sum and board the next flight to the US,” he added. The rise in ticket prices is no deterrent for travellers from the city as travel agents have been flooded with phone calls since Monday evening, with requests for tickets. As demand soars, travel agents said they are finding it increasingly difficult to service the requests. “Currently, the capacity on flights is limited and the demand is very high. Connecting flights via Dubai are catering to not just passengers to US but also other countries and continents such as Canada, Europe among others,” said Samad Qureshi, head, Fly Creative Online Pvt Ltd. With US government reopening its borders, the minister counsellor for consular affairs Don Heflin held a Facebook live with all the visa applicants on November 10. “If you are fully vaccinated, you can travel to US. If you have completed two weeks after getting WHO-approved vaccinations you can travel,” said Heflin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/flying-to-the-us-get-ready-to-pay-a-bomb/articleshow/87655840.cms||Preeti Biswas

The complainant had married the woman in January this year, but she left him after staying at her marital home for three months, police said. “The woman and her so-called family took Rs8 lakh from the man for the marriage, and then fled with the amount and jewellery worth Rs1.60 lakh,” inspector (crime) Mangesh Jagtap of the Airport police told TOI, citing the complaint. Police said the complainant was working with the bank’s establishment in Pune at the time of his wedding and some months thereafter. He was staying at Vimannagar, which remains his permanent address. A few months ago, he was transferred to Mumbai, where he moved into bank quarters along with his parents. The police are searching for the mediator, the woman and the man who presented himself as her father. Jagtap said, “The Aadhaar card, PAN card and other identity documents of the woman and her family have been found to be bogus. The woman and her family claimed to be from Nashik, but their address was also fake. We summoned the mediator, who fixed the marriage, but he is not at his home in the city and has switched off his phone.” He added, “Initially, when the woman left the complainant, he thought his wife would return and even called her a few times. She responded to his phone calls and kept assuring him that she would return, but later on stopped taking calls and switched off her phone.” When the complainant started making his own enquiries, he realised he had been cheated. He also found the jewellery worth Rs1.60 lakh missing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cheated-by-wife-2-others-says-visually-impaired-man/articleshow/87654828.cms||Gitesh Shelke

CAG’s latest report on state finances, placed in the assembly on Thursday, said KIIFB and Kerala Social Security Pension Ltd (KSSPL) are indulging in off-budget borrowing and if unchecked, it could eventually lead the state into a ‘debt trap’ even without the knowledge of the assembly. “Off-budget borrowing refers to use of these financial resources by the government for meeting expenditure requirements in a particular year or years, which are not reflected in the budget for that year or those years, for seeking grant/appropriation,” CAG said. These off-budget borrowings remain outside legislative control. They are financed through government owned or controlled public sector enterprises through market borrowings on behalf of the government. But, government must repay and service the debt from its budget, it said. CAG noted instances where the government resorted to off-budget borrowing through statutory body/government firm (KIIFB and KSSPL) amounting to R 1, 930.04 crore and Rs 6, 843.65 crore for financing its capital and revenue spending during 2019-20. These two entities borrow funds for financing various government schemes and projects, the expenditure of which are not disclosed in the budget or finance accounts of the state. In terms of revenue spending, off-budget borrowing was used for financing social security pension schemes, including welfare pensions through borrowings by KSSPL. In terms of capital spending, off-budget borrowing was used for financing critical and large infra projects through KIIFB’s borrowings, the report said. The report added that KIIFB incurred an expenditure of Rs 5,014.17 crore for government-approved infra projects till 2019-20, which are not disclosed in the budget or the accounts of state. KIIFB borrowed/raised Rs 5,036.61 crore from financial institutions till 2019-20 and paid interest amounting to Rs 353.21 crore till 2019-20 on them. The repayment of liabilities is done by utilizing petroleum cess and share of motor vehicle tax received each year from the government. Though repayment of borrowed amounts and their interest are being financed through government revenue, government’s financial documents do not reflect the borrowings, CAG said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cag-off-budget-borrowings-can-lead-to-debt-trap/articleshow/87654119.cms||---

To conclude the meeting on a positive note and sensitise the police officers towards the issues, plights and challenges of the members of the deprived classes and underprivileged communities seeking legal remedies and justice, the movie ‘Jai Bhim’ was shown on a projector. Each month, the performance of every police station and respective sub-division, crime branch, cyber police, economic offences wing and special branch is reviewed by the unit commander. Police officers confided that ahead of the review meetings, the fear of failing to perform to expected level keeps them stressed. Goyal told TOI, “The ultimate intention was to have the crime review meeting in an environment friendly and non-stressful atmosphere so that there is assimilation and dissemination of ideas.” Terming the meeting fruitful, the young IPS officer said that there was a healthy exchange of ideas and ways of executing those ideas. The meeting started at 9 am in the pandal that was put up in the open space of a lush green farm till lunch break at 1.30 pm. This was followed by Goyal issuing a ‘to do list’ for all the police station chiefs as well as senior police officers. Paithan’s sub divisional police officer Rahul Nehul-Patil said that it was the first time such a crime review meeting was held. “Not only for me, but for all the other officers, it was for the first time that we attended it in the lap of nature.” Goyal said he had positive feedback from his subordinates and most of them had found the meeting to be ‘less stressful’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-rural-police-meet-in-orchard/articleshow/87653394.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The association said that the Town Vending Committees of Delhi do not have any provision of grievance redressal mechanism yet. “Even after the Act of 2014, Delhi, through all levels of its governance, has failed to provide vendors the security of legality. Delhi has deliberately delayed the implementation of the Street Vending Act and deprived the vendors of their fundamental rights,” said Arbind Singh, national coordinator of the association of vendors. Recently, Delhi High Court had issued various directives on the pleas filed by traders in different markets of the national capital. “The TVCs need to be empowered more. Our key demand is to complete the survey of street vendors soon. The high court is asking for removal of illegal vendors from major markets, but the committees have not completed the survey only, so it has led to harassment of hawkers,” added Singh. The association plans to hold a protest across the nation next month on December 10, World Human Rights Day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vendors-association-to-hold-protest-on-nov-24/articleshow/87655419.cms||---

The two-hour in-person exam will test the students for all subjects depending on the class from standard III to X. For lower classes the exam will be conducted for 90 minutes and for higher classes the exam will be held for 120 minutes in MCQ format. Diwali vacation of all state government schools was cut short by a week for this survey. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has developed the Assessment Framework for gauging the competencies attained by the students vis-a-vis learning outcomes. The survey goes beyond the scorecard and includes the background variables to correlate student’s performance in different learning outcomes vis-a-vis contextual variables. It will be conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) as Assessment Administrator for Stds III, V, VIII and X students of state government schools, aided schools, private unaided recognized schools and central government schools. Director of the Maharashtra State Council of Education Research and Training, M D Singh, said that, “The survey will be conducted in a monitored environment in the sampled schools. NAS findings would help diagnose learning gaps of students and determine interventions required in education policies, teaching practices and learning. Through its diagnostic report cards, NAS findings help in capacity building for teachers and officials involved in the delivery of education.” In Maharashtra, schools and the students have been selected to appear for NAS by the Union ministry based on random sampling method. The field investigators have to report to school by 7.30am on Friday whereas the observers will report at 8.30am. Singh said that all schools have been instructed to follow the Covid appropriate protocol, including usage of hand sanitisers, mask, social distancing among other during the exam. Selected schools have to gather 30 students for the survey per standard. For instance, a school selected to survey classes 5 and 10 will have to call all students. Among them, 30 each of the two classes will be randomly selected with chits. The survey, in the form of a written test in languages, maths and science, is for 39 lakh students from 1.25 lakh schools in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/23k-students-from-state-to-appear-for-nas-test-today/articleshow/87654850.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

According to police officials, conditional permission was granted for Maha Padayatra after the AP high court’s direction that not more than 50 persons should be present in the rally. However, local TDP leaders and a horde of party workers attempted to rendezvous with the rally in bid to express their solidarity.  Cops said that they had to resort to lathicharge after repeated warnings failed and resulted in a scuffle when workers attempted to join the protest which could cause a law-and-order issue. In this regard, TDP leaders criticized police action with supremo N Chandrababu Naidu tweeting, “The right to protest is a cornerstone of constitutional democracy. I strongly condemn the brutal violence unleashed by @APPOLICE100 against peacefully marching farmers in Prakasam district today. The TDP stands firmly with the farmers. #AmaravatiFarmersMarch.” The Padayatrawill end on December 15 in Tirupati.

---||Rajkot||Gujarat’s ‘mad tree’ can be a good one too||Rajkot: The much-maligned gando baval or prosopis juliflora (PJ) — the invasive ‘alien’ weed that ravaged large swathes of traditional grassland in Kutch decimating livelihood of Banni people — may have the last laugh if a scientific paper can save its existence. For years now, there has been a discussion to eradicate the weed to save the Banni grassland mostly under the demand of the locals. But, a paper recently published by GUIDE (Gujarat Institute of Desert Ecology), suggested making a separate management policy for PJ, as the weed has the capacity to generate lakhs of employment and can usher in major change in the entire ecosystem of Kutch’s Banni land. The paper suggests that PJ can be used in making bread, biscuit, syrup, coffee, cocktails and even brandy apart from its wood being used in making charcoal and generating electricity. It says that PJ’s multifarious usage is well known in various countries, though it has generated very little awareness about its full potential. The paper published in Global Journal of Science Frontier Research suggested better usage with a policy intervention to generate new industry and new employment. It, however, stated that this option is very expensive and practically not possible looking at the experience of other countries. Talking to TOI, one of the authors of this paper and director of GUIDE, V Vijay Kumar said, “We need to make a separate management policy for PJ. We have considered it an alien species but it has economic and environmental potential. We have to make a new management plan for PJ considering its positive and negative points.” Kumar further said that proper planning can help generate massive employment opportunities and usher in economic development to the arid land. Prosopis pods after removing the seeds are rich in protein and glucose. Pods could be useful for making cattle feed mixture, edible biscuits, energy tonic for old people and children, coffee, brandy, prosopis tree gum, but its products are not popular in India and for that spreading of awareness is necessary. In 2009, GUIDE published a research paper named “Prosposis: Ecological, economic significance and management challenges” in which they mentioned the potential capabilities of gando baval . According to the paper, this is an invasive alien species that spreads rapidly — the only negative point of the plant species — but that if this could be controlled, mankind can reap huge benefits from it. Its wood proved to be an important source of domestic fuel in rural households in the last century. The wood burns evenly and does not spark or smoke excessively and the calorific value of wood is quite high. The other use of gando baval wood is for charcoal and electricity generation. The biomass produced from it is used in electricity generation and can generate one MW electricity from 6,169 tonnes of fuel wood. The cost of power generation from PJ is also very cheap. How did it reach India? Gando baval first arrived in India in 1857 from Mexico. It reached Sindh, an arid region north of Banni (currently in south Pakistan) and then was also introduced to Andhra Pradesh by Jamaica in 1877. Later, PJ spread across many parts of the country from Mexico, Argentina and Uruguay and also introduced in Rajasthan’s Thar desert during 1930s to stabilize the sand dunes. This weed was introduced in Kutch in 1930s to fight desertification and by 2000, it covered 40 percent of India. With 43 million trees, PJ became the dominant tree species in Gujarat. Rich ‘alien’ food Pods of the tree are considered important human food item in Peru, Chile and Argentina. These have high calcium, thiamine and riboflavin content. Flour from PJ pods is used in preparation of sweet and syrup (thick, dark and similar to honey) and is widely used in north Peru to nourish children and the old and infirm. It’s also mixed with milk, fruit and corn flour for taste and flavour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/gujarats-mad-tree-can-be-a-good-one-too/articleshow/87654157.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

In a press statement issued on Thursday, the industry body has underlined the need for additional collateral-free credit to be extended under Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS). “Under the version of ECLGS 4.0, additional ECLGS assistance of up to 10% of the outstanding as of February 29, 2020, was provided to borrowers covered under ECLGS 1.0. However, the private sector banks are reluctant in disbursement of this additional amount due to which the MSME units are unable to take benefit of the scheme,” states the statement issued by GCCI. The industry body has also raised issues on insistence of banks on submission of original physical copy of expired bank guarantee. GCCI also sought RBI intervention in the matter to ensure that these rates are rationalized and a common minimum rate of stamp duty is made applicable uniformly pan-India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/credit-availability-gcci-raises-concerns/articleshow/87654161.cms||---
---||Pune||PCMC to set up animal dispensary, shelter home||Pune: The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation has decided to set up an animal dispensary and shelter home for cats, stray and pet dogs. The dispensary and shelter home would be run in association with non-government organisation (NGO) People for Animal. The facility would offer medical treatment to pet animals at nominal fees. According to the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) general body agenda, the case paper fee for a pet’s treatment would be Rs 20, while treatments such as anti-rabies vaccination would cost Rs 100. While X-ray of smaller-size animals would cost Rs 250, sonography would cost Rs 350. In case of hospitalisation, the per-day treatment charge would be Rs 300. Vasectomy of a dog would cost Rs 1,200, while that of a cat would be done for Rs 1,300. The agenda envisages that the NGO would appoint at least two veterinary surgeons at the shelter homes to take care of the animals, for which they have demanded an honorarium of Rs 50,000. Social activist Maruti Bhapkar said the twin towns have been through the stray dog menace and despite years of effort, the civic body couldn’t curb it. Residents, mostly who commute during the night, have met with accidents because of stray dogs coming in their ways or attacking them. He said, “Vasectomy of dogs and cats is the need of the hour. But if this is going on for the past 20 years, without any result then it is worrisome. We have to make sure there is transparency in running the dispensary . Only then the facility will prove helpful for the pets and strays.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-to-set-up-animal-dispensary-shelter-home/articleshow/87654865.cms||Piyush Bhusari

---||Mumbai||IIT-Bombay team wins Rs 1.85 crore prize for CO2 removal||MUMBAI: A four-member team of students from IIT-Bombay, mentored by their two professors, has found a novel method to capture carbon dioxide emission from industries, convert them into useful salts, thereby isolating the emitted CO2 gas permanently from the atmosphere. Their concept won them a prize of 250000 USD (or about Rs 1.85 crore) in a global competition, which saw participation from 195 teams. While two teams from the institute participated, the SASIITB was among the 23 student-led teams from 10 countries to win the carbon removal demonstration competition and the only single-institution awardee from India. IISc-Bengaluru which collaborated with other international institutes also won in the category. The winners were announced on Thursday at the Sustainable Innovation Forum at COP26 summit in Glasgow.Two Ph D students, Srinath Iyer and Anwesha Banerjee, an undergraduate student Srushti Bhamare, and a junior research fellow Shubham Kumar were part of the team to win the XPRIZE for Carbon Removal student competition, supported by the Elon Musk Foundation. Speaking to TOI, Bhamare said that being an energy science student, she was always passionate about the topic and when the competition was announced, they got together in a team to ideate on a concept and did their research based on available literature. Associate professor Vikram Vishal from earth sciences and interdisciplinary programme (IDP) in the climate studies department, also one of the mentors, said that the study basically focuses on developing a tri-modular system, wherein they would help capture the carbon dioxide (which is 15-20% of the flue gas) from large-point sources of emissions (such as power, biochemical, cement, fertiliser industries) and then convert them into stable mineral carbonates, which can be again used in the industry. “This way, permanent sequestration of carbon dioxide can happen from the atmosphere,” said the professor. The goal is to not attain net-zero emissions, but a net-negative emission, said Arnab Dutta, associate professor from chemistry department and IDP in climate studies, talking about the large amount of CO2 released in the atmosphere in the last 50-60 years. “Industries may be opposed to the idea of only capturing CO2 as it would increase their manufacturing cost, but what we are providing them is a new material that can be used in their industries, making it a cost-effective solution. For instance, we can convert CO2 into calcium carbonate that is an ingredient needed in the cement industry, or even other carbonates that will have some utility value," said Dutta. He added that the tri-modular system which will have the capturing unit, storage unit and the converting unit can work independent of each other. While the technology’s feasibility has been studied at lab level already, the economic feasibility is yet to be looked into. The prize money will be used to further the research and upscale it in the coming months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-iit-b-team-wins-rs-1-85cr-prize-for-co2-removal/articleshow/87655863.cms||Yogita Rao

---||Mumbai||Nearly 50% of Dharavi’s 4.5 lakh eligible population has got both jabs||MUMBAI: Close to half of the population of Mumbai’s large slum belt of Dharavi has received both the Covid-19 vaccination doses so far. Officials said they have reached this figure by taking into account vaccinations done in civic centres, by companies via corporate social responsilibity (CSR) in the area as well as camps held by local elected representatives. Ward level officials said the total population of Dharavi is around 7 lakh but the number of those eligible for caccination stands at 4.5 lakh (those aged above 18 years). Of these, around 2.1 lakh are estimated to have taken both the doses. The first vaccination centre within any slum cluster was set up in Dharavi where the BMC aimed to vaccinate the senior population and those with comorbidities at an urban health centre, popularly known as “Chota Sion Hospital”. Until then, anyone from Dharavi who wished to get vaccinated would mostly head to the Bandra-Kurla Complex jumbo facility. Assistant municipal commissioner Kiran Dighavkar said 47.4% off the total population of Dharavi has been vaccinated. “Apart from civic health centres, vaccinations were held through CSR initiatives too. The BMC has helped mobilize beneficiaries with the help of local NGOs in cases where corporates came forward to vaccinate free of cost,” said Dighavkar, adding now their focus will be on mobile vaccination to cover all those left out in any area. “Since the ward began the vaccine-on-wheels initiative with mobile vaccination, the response has been very good as we could target those who have not taken the second shot. We will soon begin a house-to-house survey as well. That apart, ward war rooms have already started making calls to those who have not taken the vaccine, requesting them to do so,” said Dighavkar. Covid had entered Dharavi on April 1 last year and there were days when it had reported more than 90 cases as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nearly-50-of-dharavis-4-5-lakh-eligible-popn-has-got-both-jabs/articleshow/87655442.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Hyderabad||Covaxin well tolerated, phase 3 data shows 77.8% efficacy against symptomatic Covid: Lancet||HYDERABAD: A week after the World Health Organisation (WHO) granted Emergency Use Listing (EUL) to Covaxin, prestigious medical journal Lancet has stated that the phase 3 data of India’s first indigenously developed vaccine demonstrates 77.8% efficacy against symptomatic Covid-19. Its efficacy data also demonstrates 70.8% protection against all variants of SARS-CoV-2. Covaxin’s efficacy was arrived at through the evaluation of 130 confirmed cases, of which 24 were observed in the vaccine group and 106 cases were in the placebo group. The two-dose inactivated virus vaccine was developed from scratch in India by Bharat Biotech along with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Institute of Virology (NIV) Pune. The efficacy analysis showed Covaxin (BBV152) is 93.4% effective against severe symptomatic Covid-19, and offers 63.6% protection against asymptomatic Covid-19. It is also 65.2% effective against the Delta variant, 90.1% effective against Kappa variant, Lancet said. “BBV152 was well tolerated; the same proportion of participants reported adverse events in the vaccine group [1597 out of 12879 (12.4%)] and placebo group [1597 of 12874 (12.4%)] with no clinically significant differences in the distributions of solicited, unsolicited, or serious adverse events between the groups, and no cases of anaphylaxis or vaccine-related deaths,” the peer-reviewed journal observed. Covaxin safety analysis demonstrates that the adverse events reported were similar to placebo, with 12% of the subjects experiencing commonly known side effects and less than 0.5% of subjects experiencing serious adverse events, Bharat Biotech said, adding: “Covaxin was well tolerated and the Data Safety Monitoring Board has not reported any safety concerns related to the vaccine. The overall rate of adverse events observed in Covaxin was lower than that seen in Covid-19 vaccines. The safety profile of Covaxin is now well established”. In a separate comment in The Lancet, Chinese experts Jing-Xin Li and Feng-Cai Zhu of the Nanjing-based Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention pointed out that with the Delta variant outcompeting all SARS-CoV-2 variants as the most predominant variant of concern globally, with substantially higher transmissibility than other VOCs, the BBV152 Phase 3 results reported by Raches Ella and colleagues were a “welcome advance”. “…in a phase 3 trial of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BBV152) based on an Asp614Gly variant, the authors found a substantial reduction in symptomatic Covid-19... In the study by Ella and colleagues, in all the delta-positive cases, the viral load in vaccine recipients was significantly lower than in placebo recipients,” they said while pointing to the reduced vaccine effectiveness being reported in real world studies of other vaccines like the ones developed by Pfizer and AstraZeneca. Though Li & Zhu observed that the BBV152 study cohort was less ethnically diverse as only Indian participants were involved, they said “the study provides evidence of protection against asymptomatic infection that might be of public health significance, which has not been reported in previous trials of other SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.” “Generally, the apparent protection against severe Covid-19 is most crucial, but the capability of preventing asymptomatic infection would also protect against mild disease, transmission, and eventually might lead to a reduction in subsequent cases of severe Covid-19,” the Chinese experts said. Zhu and Li also said that the roll-out of the vaccine might ease the ultra-cold chain requirements of other SARS-CoV-2 vaccine platforms, increase the finite global manufacturing capacity, and improve insufficient supply of vaccines which disproportionately affects low-income and middle-income countries. Meanwhile, Bharat Biotech said Lancet peer-review confirms the efficacy analysis that demonstrates Covaxin to be effective against Covid-19 and that Covaxin is the only Covid-19 vaccine to have demonstrated efficacy data from phase III clinical trials against the Delta variant at 65.2%. “The peer-review of Covaxin phase III clinical trial data in The Lancet, an authoritative voice in global medicine, validates our commitment to data transparency and meeting the stringent peer-review standards of world leading medical journals,” said Bharat Biotech chairman & managing director Dr Krishna Ella. He said with this, data from Covaxin’s product development and clinical trials have been published in 10 peer-reviewed journals, making Covaxin one of the most highly published Covid-19 vaccines in the world. Terming the partnership between Bharat Biotech, ICMR and NIV as one of the most successful public private partnerships, ICMR director general Dr Balram Bhargava said the publication of the efficacy data in Lancet speaks highly about the strong position of Covaxin among the global front-runner Covid-19 vaccines. “The bench to bedside journey of Covaxin in less than 10 months showcases the immense strength of `Atmanirbhar Bharat’ along with the Indian academia and industry in fighting against the odds and carving a niche in the global community,” Bhargava said. The Phase III efficacy and safety study involved around 25,800 volunteers across 25 sites in India. So far, over 150 million doses of Covaxin have been manufactured and supplied and it is now being evaluated in controlled clinical trials in children aged 2-18 years. The company has submitted data of the children's trials to the Indian drug regulator and its partner Ocugen has applied to US Food & Drug Administration (USFDA) for emergency use authorisation for paediatric use of Covaxin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covaxin-phase-3-data-shows-77-8-efficacy-against-symptomatic-covid-lancet/articleshow/87654875.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Delhi||Delhi HC seeks DDA reply on hawkers’ plea on 2021 master plan||NEW: Delhi High Court on Thursday sought a response from Delhi Development Authority on a plea by the National Hawkers’ Federation challenging the Master Plan of 2021. A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh issued notice to DDA on the petition, which claims that the Delhi Master Plan of 2021 failed to take into account the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014. The petitioner, which claims to be an association of street vendors and 1,188 unions in the country, has said that the overarching objective of the Street Vendors Act, 2014 is to provide for and promote a supportive environment for the urban street vendors to carry out their vocation while ensuring that vending activities do not lead to overcrowding and unsanitary conditions in public spaces and streets. However, the Master Plan 2021, which was approved in 2007, “wrongfully retains” provisions that do not reflect the criteria set out for street vendors under the Street Vendors Act, the petitioner said. It also stated that if DDA was not directed to take appropriate steps to implement the Street Vendors Act, urban street vendors would continue to suffer irreparable loss that would result in an absolute miscarriage of justice. The plea argues that the sections for “informal sector” under the Master Plan are “manifestly arbitrary” and make no mention of the Street Vendors Act, which provides for a plan for street vending and the formation of town vending committees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-seeks-dda-reply-on-hawkers-plea-on-2021-master-plan/articleshow/87655444.cms||---

The Niti Aayog CEO said this at the Indian Institute of Management – Ahmedabad (IIM-A) campus on Thursday while delivering the inaugural lecture for the series on ‘Public Policy Priorities for the Social Sector – Leaving No One Behind in New India.’ The lecture is part of the Public Talk Series titled ‘India 2031: The Decade of Transformation’ organised by JSW School of Public Policy (JSW-SPP) at the IIM-A.  Talking about the path that India must take to achieve public policy priorities that can result in holistic and inclusive growth, Kant talked about the role that digitization can play in building India as a future superpower. He added that massive benefit that can be achieved from tracking real time data and publishing it in the public domain to create transparency. Citing the example of the government’s ‘aspirational district programme’ where 115 of the country’s most backward districts were chosen for monitoring, Kant said that ranking them improved their performance to a great extent. “These districts were poor and backwards not because of lack or resources or lack of funds, but because of governance failure. The government started ranking them not on a monthly basis but on real time, minute to minute basis. We started putting the data out in the public domain. We started naming and shaming collectors (of districts that fared poorly) and started rewarding the better performing collectors,” said Kant. As a result, many of these districts are today faring better than the best performing districts of the country on many parameters, he further said. “I am great believer in good data, real time data,” said Kant. India is passing through a window of demographic transition that rarely happens through history and therefore this growth is critical. India has grown at this growth rate for short period of 5-6 years, but we need to sustain this over a few-decade period. Kant said that five key areas such as improving outcomes in education, health, and nutrition; promoting sunrise sectors of growth such as AI and data science, scientific urbanization, technological advancement and shifting to sustainable sources of energy such as green hydrogen can contribute significantly to India’s growth in the years to come. The country is poised to become a global leader for electrolyzer manufacturing and green hydrogen products. The government aims to bring down the cost of green hydrogen from USD 4 per kg presently to USD 1 per kg by 2030, Kant said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/digitization-key-to-indias-future-kant/articleshow/87654174.cms||---

In his complaint with Karanj police Rathod alleged breach of trust and cheating against an unidentified person. He stated that on November 6 he had scolded his son Satish, 18, who then consumed some poisonous substance. Satish was taken to the local hospital from where he was referred to Jivraj Mehta Hospital in Vejalpur. The complainant said that on Wednesday, when he along with his relatives were sitting in the compound of the hospital, an unidentified person came near them while talking on the phone. The person was telling someone on the phone that he had good contacts with leaders and can manage to get relief in the medical bill. Later the person asked Rathod who was admitted in the hospital, and the complainant narrated his story stating that his son had recovered, but the hospital asked for a bill of Rs 36,800 before giving him discharge. The accused then informed him that for the Devipujak community, Gujarat government gives Rs 1.5 lakh as subsidy and from that amount he could pay the hospital bill and keep the remaining amount with him. However, the person told him that he would be required to pay Rs 18,000 as GST cost for getting the subsidy. The complainant stated that he agreed. The man took his brother-in-law Jilabhai Rathod to Apna Bazaar in Lal Darwaja. He told Jila to stand outside the office while he got the documents signed from the officer. After this, he went inside with the money and never returned. Rathod then lodged a complaint with police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-cheated-with-lure-of-medical-bill-subsidy/articleshow/87654173.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Eyebrows raised over Kheda SP post||Ahmedabad: Government appointments are usually by the book and even when explicit rules are not framed, certain unwritten rules are followed. Needless to say, there is widespread speculation in police power corridors over the appointment of a junior deputy superintendent of police (DySP) as in-charge superintendent of police (SP) of Kheda district, giving her precedence over senior officers who are traditionally given charge when the regular SP is on leave. Arpita Patel, a 2011-batch direct DySP, currently posted as DySP of Kapadvanj division in Kheda district, has been holding charge as SP of the district since July 22, through an order of the IGP (administration). The appointment came after Divya Mishra, the then Kheda SP, went to deputation as additional deputy director in the central intelligence bureau (IB). After her appointment, charge was given to another officer, but the order was revoked within hours sparking speculation that it was done to protect senior politicians who may face action over large-scale illegal land deals in certain villages. “When the SP goes on leave for personal or official reasons, charge of the district is given to the seniormost of deputies for a limited period – 15 to 30 days,” said a senior police official on condition of anonymity. “But there are no written rules when it comes to the duration of holding charge or who to give charge to. It is understood that officers senior to the officer holding charge will not feel comfortable.” In the appointment of Patel, experts point out two anomalies. “Kheda and Anand are like twin districts. In the past, the SPs of either district often held charge of if the regular SP was unavailable. Instead, Patel has been holding charge for over three months now. This is unusual, if not rare. Secondly, Kalpesh Chawda, though Patel’s batchmate, is ahead on the seniority list. This decision could affect the functioning of the unit,” said the official, adding that two other DySPs in Kheda district are promotees from PI rank and are junior to Patel and Chawda. When the state government was apprised of the situation, on October 29, the undersecretary of the home department issued a notification, giving charge as Kheda SP to Vishal Vaghela, an IPS officer posted in the state CID (crime). Surprisingly, the order was revoked within hours, reinstating Patel as in-charge SP. The development set off speculation that the development is linked to the controversy over land deals in certain villages of the district – several plots of land, belonging to both farmers and government, were illegally transferred to private entities close to prominent politicians. The needle of suspicion rests on some mid-level bureaucrats and certain politicians – including a former minister – who have allegedly been trying to thwart the filing of FIRs in these cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/eyebrows-raised-over-kheda-sp-post/articleshow/87654172.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Drained of funds, most mucor patients put off rehab surgeries||Nagpur: It cost Navin Paul Rs1.5 crore to treat his mucormycosis infection after Covid. But he still ended up losing one eye and much of his facial bones, leading to severe disfigurement, and has now run out of resources to get the reconstructive surgery done. Paul is a mid-level state government employee. To treat mucormycosis, he got Rs1 crore from the railways, as his wife is employed there. The remaining Rs50 lakh was his own money. However, the railway scheme does not cover any procedure or reconstructive surgery to restore his face. There is no such plan with the state government either. Even the money for his artificial eye had come from his pocket, says Paul. No medical government scheme covers reconstructive surgeries, which are considered cosmetic procedures. Only the treatment is paid for, he says, adding that he may need another Rs8 lakh for the face reconstruction. Similarly, Abdul Sadik, a retired zilla parishad teacher, also suffered from Covid and mucor infection. With no insurance, and over Rs5 lakh already spent, the family has put the reconstructive surgery on hold, says his son Sajid. There are a number of such patients, who are already drained of funds from treating Covid and mucor infections, and left with disfigured faces due to removal of bones and eyes but no money for further treatment, say doctors. There is no government scheme which covers reconstructive procedures. Some insurance companies are providing the cover, however costly treatment of mucor itself has exhausted the cover of most patients, say doctors. It is learnt that the Government Dental College has sent a proposal to fund such procedures. A decision is awaited. Nagpur divisional commissioner Prajakta Lavangare said a proposal to use CSR money accumulated under Vidarbha Development Fund is also in process. A grant of Rs1 to Rs1.5 lakh may be given. The first priority is likely to be for economically weaker sections. Source say the average cost of treatment comes to around Rs3 lakh, with around 12 components used, where a single screw costs as much as Rs25,000. Senior dentist Dr Harish Rathi says a full reconstruction of the facial structure is possible through surgeries. It needs a rather thorough study on case to case basis. The cost is on the higher side because the material used has to be sustainable for a long term. Use of advanced technology also adds to the cost. Crowd funding can be one of the options to fund such treatment. A government scheme should also be introduced, he said. Dr Bipin Dehane, a maxillofacial surgeon, said as much as 40% to 50% patients have put their treatment on hold only because of financial constraints. It’s not just a cosmetic treatment. The prosthetics also have a functional use in the body. A number of minute aspects like the load bearing capacity has to be taken into account for implants. This is also a challenging task for doctors as each case as its own nuances. Among other cases, a farmer in Yavatmal say he is now left with just one acre of land after he sold 3 acres to meet the Rs28 lakh treatment cost. Unable to speak or chew properly, he is clueless about arranging more funds for treatment. Another state government employee said she is only waiting for a government scheme to get her husband’s surgery done.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/drained-of-funds-most-mucor-patients-put-off-rehab-surgeries/articleshow/87654880.cms||Shishir Arya

The state board said the official timetable will be put up on its website which should be followed. A parent of a student who will be appearing for the HSC exam next year said there were many messages doing the rounds which made it difficult to understand which one is the legitimate one. “The state board’s letterhead was copied in some of the messages by the miscreants,” he added. The statement issued by the state board signed by the secretary of the board Ashok Bhosale stated that, “The students and parents should not believe social media messages and only trust the schedule that the state board will put up on its official website.

---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Civic bodies up the heat on non-veg street food vendors||VADODARA/RAJKOT: Though they have always been an eyesore in the state, Rajkot and Vadodara municipal corporations have of late issued directives to ensure that non-vegetarian street food carts stay ‘invisible’ to public eye. The first to crack the whip was the ruling BJP in Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) which orally ordered officers to remove street vendors selling non-vegetarian food and egg dishes from the main roads. A drive in this regard started in the city for the past two days, albeit there is no notification or official order issued to this effect. Officials, however, maintain that they are not specifically targeting non-veg food vendors but are taking action anywhere they receive a complaint of encroachment. Rajkot mayor Pradeep Dav himself started the drive after he got several complaints. Dav held meetings with some non-vegetarian food vendors before Diwali and instructed them to shift from the main roads. Dav told TOI, “I have asked officials to shift non-veg and egg ‘larris’ (carts) from major crossroads and those that park themselves near the temples. A majority of people feel disgusted while passing by these carts because of its smell and many also hang chicken outside.” Municipal commissioner Amit Arora said, “There is no specific instruction to remove non-veg carts. We remove all kinds of encroachment specifically where we get complaints of encroachment.” RMC has seized six carts selling non-veg food items in the past two days. There was a suggestion to develop a hawker zone specially for non-veg street vendors but for that RMC has found no suitable place. Like Rajkot, orders in Vadodara too are oral and no notification has been brought out so far. In Vadodara, chairman of the standing committee of Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC), Dr Hitendra Patel gave instructions in this regard to officials at a meeting on Wednesday evening. Patel, however, assured that the vendors will not be ousted. “We are asking the vendors to ensure that they do not hang or display non-vegetarian food. They will have to keep it covered,” said Patel. The chairman said that this was done to ensure that hygiene is maintained and sentiments are not hurt. At the other end, the state president of National Association of Street Vendors of India, Arvind Sindha, who is from Vadodara claimed that non-vegetarian food vendors had been asked to move away from main roads. “They have been told to move away from 30m and 18m roads,” he said. Refuting this allegation, Patel, however, said that the carts were only being asked to ensure they do not hamper traffic movement. “At times there is heavy rush at such places and leads to traffic problems,” he said. Meanwhile, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation standing committee chairman said, “We had in fact begun a campaign against non-veg food stalls selling without licences in front or near religious places. The campaign is still on and I will take a review of this shortly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/civic-bodies-up-the-heat-on-non-veg-street-food-vendors/articleshow/87654178.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: BPLR residents fight for wasted amenity space||PUNE: A patch of land near Regent Plaza in Baner has become a bone of contention between local residents and the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). While the land is marked as an amenity space in the city’s development plan, residents said that the area is being used for garbage segregation. As a result, the area stinks, especially after the rain. Stray dogs and cows roam the area, and it has also become a breeding site for mosquitoes, said residents, who demanded that the land patch be cleaned, and garbage segregation shifted to some other place. Complaints lodged with the PMC helpline have been “closed”, with the civic body maintaining that the area is cleaned daily by 12:30pm. Residents, however, described the PMC’s claim as “completely false”. Vinod Gupta, a resident of the area, said that despite many complaints, the civic body has not taken any action except providing false assurances. “Every time, the complaint has been closed stating that the area has been cleaned. They clean the central area and push all the waste to the corners. How is this a solution to the problem? This is literally an eyewash. The area should be cleaned after waste segration. They cannot put a big dump yard in the middle of a residential area. There are so many cases of dengue that we get to hear. This site is a breeding site for such mosquitoes. And it stinks horribly, especially after the rain,” said Gupta. Rajendra Chutar, president, Baner Pashan Link Road Welfare Trust, said that the matter has been discussed at every mohalla committee meeting. “First of all, waste segration should not happen in a residential area. What we want is complete removal of waste. Some hotels in nearby areas also dump waste at night, adding to the problem. The amenity space should be developed as a park or something useful and not for dumping waste,” said Chutar. Manish Mishra, another resident, said that a meeting was held with Swach representative who blamed the PMC for the collapse of their secondary system. “A few BPLR Welfare Trust members went to attend the PMC Mohalla Committee meeting and there, too, multiple issues regarding BPLR (garbage, streetlights, water, sterilisation of dogs, traffic signboards etc) were raised. On our insistence, deputy commissioner Sandip Khalate promised to visit our area soon. Post this meeting, we had a meeting with sanitary inspectors Jaya Sangde and Vijay Bhoir. A Swach representatives, too, was present. Both the parties blamed each other yet again. A joint meeting between the PMC, Swach and BPLR residents was agreed upon in next few days,” said Mishra. A PMC official said that the delay was due to fewer number of trips by dumpers due to issues in the plant. “There are some issues in solid waste processing plants due to which the dumpers which carry waste to the plants are unable to make multiple trips. So, if earlier they made three trips to empty the waste per day, now they are able to make only one such trip, leading to waste not being picked from segregating areas. We are trying to solve the issue.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bplr-residents-fight-for-wasted-amenity-space/articleshow/87654889.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Scale up Covid testing as detection halved in Diwali’||Pune: Covid detection tests in Maharashtra reduced to 5.6 lakh during Diwali in the November 3-9 week from an average of more than 10-11 lakh during the corresponding seven-day period in September and October. The recent number of weekly tests in the state was the lowest in the past two months. Public health officials attributed the drop to festivities as well as a consistent decline in Covid cases. The Maharashtra task force has now directed the government to scale up testing, especially in districts that have registered a higher weekly positivity than the state average (1.3%) as presented in the Cabinet on Wednesday. The public health department registered 3,23,150 RT-PCR and 2,35,813 rapid antigen tests between November 3 and 9 with 17 districts conducting less than 5,000 tests during the period. The highest weekly tests were registered from Mumbai (2.1 lakh), followed by Thane (85,033), Pune (63,044) and Raigad (26,455). The lowest weekly tests were registered in Bhandara (370). “Ten districts continued to register a higher weekly positivity than the state’s average and testing should be increased there. We cannot be complacent in testing. Districts that are continuing to see more active cases should conduct more tests,” said task force member Dr Shashank Joshi. State health minister Rajesh Tope had told TOI November would be “a crucial month”, as a lot of crowding was seen during recent festivities. As the state has the capacity to conduct 2-2.5 lakh tests, districts have been told to not reduce testing. Tope said tests had dropped due to low daily detections and fewer contacts to track. “We have told the districts to keep a close watch on the situation, especially after the festive season,” he said. Task force member Dr Rahul Pandit said the next two weeks are extremely important.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-scale-up-covid-testing-as-detection-halved-in-diwali/articleshow/87655448.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Diabetic retinopathy is emerging as the biggest cause of blindness in the country. As many Covid patients discovered they were diabetic post-recovery, screening is the only way to diagnose diabetic retinopathy. Doctors said those detected with increased sugar levels must understand that it may not be the case that they were diabetic only due to use of steroids. Many patients are diabetic for a longer duration, probably five to six years more than they assume. An estimated 16% of all diabetic patients are believed to be affected by retinopathy. Eye surgeon Dr Gopal Arora said India is not going into sub-speciality of ophthalmology. “Diabetic retinopathy is one such specialty. A new telemedicine option is now available especially for diabetic retinopathy to help screen patients in remote parts of the country. Through teleopthalmology, we will be able to screen patients from big cities,” he said. Dr Arora said a lot of borderline or non-diabetics have suddenly been diagnosed as diabetics after Covid waves. “Some normalized after stopping steroids. But sugar level of not all reverted to normal. Such patients will remain diabetic. We get patients who say they were diagnosed with diabetes two months back. The detection was done two months back while they may have had the disorder for much longer,” he said, adding they need a check up to rule out retinopathy. Retina surgeon Dr Sandeep Anjankar said, “Some 20% of people are diabetic. Around 8% of them have retinopathy but remain undiagnosed. Around 5% have advanced diabetic retinopathy, which is near blindness. This is happening because diabetic patients are unaware that they have retinopathy. People only take medicines for diabetes or other related issues like cardiac or kidney. They approach us when suddenly they stop seeing.” Dr Anjankar added that retina is mirror to the brain. “If there is a problem on retina, patient may have problem in kidney, heart or brain. As compared to other complex procedures, retina check up is simple. Early detection can help vision or increase longevity of vision. In late stage, retinal detachment or vitreous haemorrage occurs,” he said. Endocrinologist Dr Pramod Gandhi said after Covid, a lot of people realised they have diabetes. “In our society, the number of people who don’t know they have diabetes is equal to the number of known diabetics. Probably, during Covid pandemic we have detected those patients. Confinement at home, lack of exercise, stress related to loss of job, weight gain etc precipitated diabetes.” “Diabetes retinopathy is a known complication. If diabetes remain uncontrolled forever, this is the most common cause of permanent blindness. Hence, people who recently discovered their diabetic condition must keep it in control to reduce chances of retinopathy,” Dr Gandhi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/diabetic-patients-must-ensure-regular-check-up-to-rule-out-retinopathy/articleshow/87654900.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Bullet bike gang mastermind sold 150 stolen bikes in Nepal||LUCKNOW: Shoaib Khan, the mastermind of ‘Bullet bike gang’ arrested after an encounter with police on Thursday, has allegedly sold over 150 bikes in Nepal. The accused has four theft cases in Lucknow and over 25 cases in adjoining districts. He was on the run from last one year. Police said that his two aides, Ajay alias Azhar and Dilshad, were arrested for bike lifting in July from Chowk. Additional Deputy Commissioner of police, North, Prachi Singh, said that Shoaib used to steal ‘bullet bikes’ in the wee hours which were parked unattended or in closed alleys outside, using a ‘smart key’ and sometimes breaking the locks. He then used to drive them to Nepal via Bahraich. Singh also said that all others who helped Shoaib in transporting the vehicle and his channel are being tracked. “The reason for stealing bullet bikes from UP and then selling them to Nepal is because in the neighbouring country, the price of ‘bullet’ bikes is around Rs 6 lakh while in Uttar Pradesh it is around Rs 2 lakh,” said Amit Sahu, sub-inspector with crime branch of Lucknow police. Sahu said that Shoaib and his gang members used to sell stolen bikes in Nepal for which they used to get a cut of Rs 25,000 per bike. Police officers said that Shoaib during interrogation revealed that he managed to sell seven bikes in Nepal in Diwali week. He also said that once the bike was delivered to Nepal, the other gang members used to tamper its registration and engine numbers using machines and then put new numbers before selling them to customers. Shoaib’s hometown is in Kanpur and he shifted to Gujarat for a few years with his in-laws before coming back to Lucknow and started stealing bullet bikes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bullet-bike-gang-mastermind-sold-150-stolen-bikes-in-nepal/articleshow/87655454.cms||---

---||Delhi||No coercive action against liquor retailers for not paying the licence fees||New Delhi: The AAP government on Thursday assured Delhi High Court that no coercive action will be taken against liquor retailers for the time being for not paying the licence fees under the new excise policy. The assurance came on a petition by over 16 retail liquor traders, the successful bidders for licences to operate retail liquor vends. They contested the decision of Delhi government to levy licence fees with effect from November 1. Appearing for the government, senior advocates AM Singhvi and Rahul Mehra said no coercive steps action will be taken against the traders for now since they are partners in the business. In view of the assurance, justice Rekha Palli listed the matter for further hearing on November 15 and added, “I hope you will abide by your statement”. On the court’s earlier query about the number of liquor brands where MRPs are fixed and those yet to be done, the government informed the court that out of the popular 30 brands, MRPs of 10 have been fixed. For another seven, the process would be completed in the next two days. During the hearing, the judge said, “You (Delhi government) started the policy with such fanfare, but these issues are yet to be ironed out. You should be a little pragmatic.” The new bidders also sought to restrain the government from demanding sums of money in the form of licence fees or security deposits and also to direct the authorities not to levy or demand licence fees from the successful bidders until the government performs its obligations under the tender terms and conditions. It also sought to postpone the date for the scheduled commencement of business from November 17. One of the bidders said the entire process — from the determination of MRP to retail sale — is a time-consuming exercise and if the scheduled date of start of business is November 17, as specified by the government, it is a complete breach of contract that there is delay in the registration of brands and determination of MRP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-coercive-action-against-liquor-retailers-for-not-paying-the-licence-fees/articleshow/87655467.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||2-yr period for lapse of land proceedings will not apply after new Act, rules SC||Nagpur: Quashing the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court’s verdict, the Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that the two-year period prescribed under the ‘Land Acquisition Act, 1894’ for lapse of acquisition proceedings for not delivering the compensation would not apply for award that took place after 2013 Act came into force. The HC had cancelled acquisition of 203.86 hectares made in 2011 for Gosikhurd project in Bhandara, after the villagers from Ambadi village approached it on July 27, 2017. The petitioners had prayed for quashing the compensation award of October 30, 2014, contending that as per the 1894 Act, it should have been passed within two years from the date of declaration, which was before August 8, 2014. The HC held that the October 30, 2014, award would be of no consequence, as the acquisition proceedings were lapsed. The Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation (VIDC) executive engineer working on the mega project then knocked the apex court’s doors. “The HC judgment of setting aside the award and holding that the acquisition proceedings had lapsed is set aside. It is held that the acquisition proceedings had not lapsed, and the award is legal and valid. The appeals are allowed in the aforesaid terms without any order as to costs,” a division bench comprising justices AM Khanwilkar and Sanjiv Khanna held. The bench made it clear that Section 25 of the ‘Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013’ would apply to the government’s award. “The period during which the HC order would inhibit action on the part of the authorities to proceed with the making of the award would be excluded while computing the period under Section 25. Accordingly, period of 79 days from May 26, 2014, when HC had stayed operation of the notification of March 19, 2014, till the new notification of August 13, 2014, was issued has to be excluded. The award purportedly dated October 30, 2014, was in any case duly made on or before the extended date of March 20, 2015. Hence, the concerned award is valid,” the top court said. The judges asked the Maharashtra government that it may conduct an inquiry in reference to the imputation regarding manipulation and backdating of the award and take remedial and corrective action as may be necessary and to ensure such situations do not arise in future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2-yr-period-for-lapse-of-land-proceedings-will-not-apply-after-new-act-rules-sc/articleshow/87654945.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra active cases/million is now below eight states||Pune: Maharashtra’s active cases per million population is now lower than at least eight states in India, fresh data from the state public health department reveals. The state’s active cases per million population as on November 9 were 105, lower than Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Mizoram, Telangana, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur and Meghalaya.Maharashtra’s additional chief secretary (health), Dr Pradeep Vyas, said, “Though Maharashtra has the second highest active cases in India in terms of absolute numbers, its actual disease burden is much lower than several other states if the number of Covid cases are calculated per million population.” A senior official with the state health department told TOI that calculating the number of cases per million was the scientific way to compare state-wise burden because different states had different populations. Maharashtra is the second-most populous state in India after Uttar Pradesh. “Absolute Covid-19 cases in various states cannot convey the real picture of the disease burden in a region. Hence, the per million population method is used. For instance, if 50 are infected in a population of 100 people in a state, the attack rate is 50% there. Similarly, if 20 out of 100 are infected in another state, the attack rate is 20%. Maharashtra’s population is nearly 13 crore — one of the highest among the states in India. When Covid-19 cases are calculated per million population, actual disease burden will drop much lower in comparison to several other regions,” the official said. Health department data showed Maharashtra’s active cases per million had also dropped below the national average of 116. As on October 26, Maharashtra’s active cases per million residents was 181, higher than the national average of 135. Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Telangana then had lower active cases per million population in comparison. State Covid-19 Task Force member Dr Shashank Joshi told TOI, “In the past, Maharashtra did have the second highest active Covid-19 cases per million population among other states. But the situation improved with a consistent drop in new Covid-19 cases. However, a word of caution: states such as Maharashtra and Kerala should not reduce their testing. Testing has gone down in both the states, which should be addressed as soon as possible. We may see a post-festive spike, thus the state needs to be vigilant.” Dr Joshi said Maharashtra still had some pockets where the virus was in circulation: urban hubs such as Mumbai, zones like Pune, Kolhapur, where Covid numbers suddenly shoot up and simmer down, as well as regions like Marathwada and Vidarbha. “The focus should be to vaccinate with at least one dose the over 2 crore eligible in Maharashtra who have not received the first vaccine shot.

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Bapu Bhawan employee held for harassing woman staffer||LUCKNOW: A section in-charge at Bapu Bhawan was arrested from his Golf City residence in Lucknow on Thursday for sexually harassing a woman contractual employee and threatening to terminate her from service. The woman complainant works as a computer operator in the office where the accused is section in-charge. The accused was booked on October 29 and arrested after a video went viral on social media in which he was seen sexually harassing the woman. As per the survivor, she joined the job in 2013 on contractual basis at the office. The accused had been harassing her since 2018. “He had evil designs in his mind for me and I sensed it in the years I have been working there. I kept quiet and avoided his advances as I feared losing my job. He used to pass lewd comments at me regularly,” she alleged in her complaint after which an FIR was lodged. She also alleged that for the last one month, he became more bold due to her silence. “He made an indecent proposal asking me to meet him in the women’s toilet. I rebuked him at this and he threatened to terminate me from the job,” she alleged. She also claimed that he later sat close to her and asked her to agree to his proposal. “If you do not accept my proposal I will terminate you from the job. I will spoil your life and you will not be able to show your face in society. I love you and want to marry you,” the accused allegedly told the survivor. The survivor said she was frightened at the accused’s audacity. “I am being threatened to be killed for not accepting Yadav’s marriage proposal,” she alleged. Additional deputy commissioner, Central Zone, Raghvendra Mishra said that the accused was arrested under the charges of sexual harassment, singing obscene songs or reciting such words and criminal intimidation. “We had lodged a case on October 29 and a probe was being conducted in the case,” said Mishra. (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bapu-bhawan-employee-held-for-harassing-woman-staffer/articleshow/87655469.cms||---

Irked over ‘inaction’ despite multiple complaints, locals say there are severalstreets that are plunged into darkness after the sun sets. Improper illumination has led to several accidents in the past, alleged Bhupendra Singh Kathait, a city councillor. “On Wednesday, an elderly woman out on a morning walk was hit by a speeding vehicle in the Jakhan area, which is very poorly lit. Similarly, a two-wheeler had recently crashed into a truck. We have raised the issue many times but to no avail,” Kathait added. Locals allege that there are dark patches in several localities, which make it unsafe for early morning or late-night walkers. “I take the Sahastradhara road every day. The area has a canopy of trees and limited lights, some of which are non-functional. I am more worried about being hit by some vehicle. Now that the winter has set in, these streetlights should be repaired,” said Manoj Saraswat, a city resident working in IT park. While residential areas in the city don’t have an extensive problem, walkers in such locations want more safeguards in place. “Canal road has working lights but they are sparsely located and it would definitely be more convenient, especially for walkers to have more lights around. Even the road going to the airport has limited number of streetlights. These are frequented stretches and public safety should be the top priority in these locations,” said Yesh Veer Arya, a Canal road resident. The maintenance and functioning of streetlights have been outsourced by the municipal corporation. “The last time the residents raised concerns, we had written a letter of reprimand to the company, asking it to rectify any fault. We are working on finishing the streetlight work in all 100 wards. Later, focus will be on expansion,” said Rohitash Sharma, deputy municipal commissioner. Notably, a protest had been staged on November 1 and 2 at the DMC office to highlight the concern regarding faulty and non-functional streetlights. Residents had claimed that areas like Dilaram chowk, Jakhan, several parts of Rajpur road and Defence colony, among others did not have proper lighting, putting public safety at risk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/dysfunctional-streetlights-in-doon-raise-safety-concerns-irk-residents/articleshow/87654248.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

The team of doctors led by head of pediatric surgery department of KGMU, Prof SN Kureel, and comprising Dr Archika Gupta and Dr Sunil Kanoujia is credited with the discovery. The achievement in the field of exstrophy-epispadias has been included in ‘Thieme Medical Publisher’ —an American German medical and science publisher. Exstrophy-epispadias is one the most serious birth defects involving one baby in 10,000 births where the urinary bladder and urethra of penis are turned inside out accompanied with constant urine leak. "Results after multistage surgery done in a span of 3-5 years for this congenital defect were not very encouraging. The research conducted by Prof Kureel and his team new anatomical facts were discovered based on which a new surgical technique of single stage total reconstruction was developed. This new technique showed remarkable improvement in results in terms of urine control and aesthetics," said an official press statement from KGMU on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kgmu-surgeon-wins-global-acclaim/articleshow/87655475.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Killer father signs away right to custody of love child||GANDHINAGAR: Sachin Dixit, the father of Shivam (name changed), the cherubic boy with angelic smile and innocent face whose abandonment shocked the state and unravelled the grisly murder of his mother, has relinquished legal rights to the custody of his son, social justice and empowerment department officials said. Sunaina Tomar, additional chief secretary, social justice and empowerment, said the father signed an affidavit giving up his right to legal custody of his son some ten days ago. “He will be given up to two months time to reconsider his decision, of which 10 days have passed. If he reiterates his decision, a process will be undertaken so that the child can be adopted through the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA),” Tomar said. CARA is an autonomous and statutory body of the union ministry of women and child development in the Government of India and functions as a nodal body for the adoption of Indian children. A month ago, Shivam was abandoned by a man at the Swaminarayan Gurukul Gaushala at Pethapur. The case captured the interest of the public and ministers alike and Gandhinagar police cracked the case within hours, revealing that the child had been abandoned by his father who had first murdered his partner and Shivam’s mother, Mehendi, in Vadodara. While the father was sent to judicial custody, Shivam was sent to the Odhav Shishu Gruh run by the state government. The child’s paternal and maternal grandparents did not evince any interest in his custody. With his mother dead, the father giving up custody rights will pave the way for his adoption. Sources in the social justice and empowerment department said the child’s maternal aunt regularly comes to the Shishu Gruh asking to meet the child. She is keen on taking custody of him. “As the child has already undergone a lot at a very young age. It will not be good for his mental health if the aunt is allowed to meet him. Also, this is the second marriage of the aunt. Generally, CARA follows very rigorous eligibility criteria for adoption to ensure the child gets the most emotionally and financially stable family to thrive in,” said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/killer-father-signs-away-right-to-custody-of-love-child/articleshow/87654246.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Ban up in smoke, garbage burning in the open choking lungs of Lucknow||LUCKNOW: Burning of garbage in the open continues in the city despite it being one of the major factors responsible for the spike in air pollution levels. Lucknow Municipal Corporation had prohibited garbage burning about four years ago with a provision of slapping a fine of Rs 5,000 on those caught violating the ban. The rule also provided for deducting a day’s wage from the civic body’s sanitary workers as penalty, if they were found burning garbage in the open. However, TOI in its reality check found that open garbage burning by workers and people is still in practice in areas like Lalbagh, Latouche Road, Rajajipuram, Mahanagar, Naka Hindola, Madiaon, Aliganj, Jankipuram, Gomtinagar, Daliganj and a few other areas. In winters, such activities cause more air pollution because smoke combines with tiny water droplets in mist or fog to form smog which remains suspended in the atmosphere for long. TimesViewA collective effort involving various civic agencies and people is required to stop the practise of burning garbage in the open. While LMC needs to build a mechanism of regular monitoring so that those violating the ban are penalised, people should voluntarily abstain from such activities and even stop others from doing it because air pollution harms one and all.Residents complain of heavy breathing, nasal congestion and headache due to air pollution caused by garbage burning. Some also claimed that their complaints to the LMC helpline in this regard have gone unheard so far. Sunil Srivastava (65), Mahanagar, said that he has stopped going for morning walks because of the problem. “Since I am diabetic and have lung issues, morning walk has been recommended by the doctor, but instead of fresh air, we get smoke in the morning. Sanitary workers after sweeping the street, put dry leaves and garbage on fire, instead of carrying them to the nearest dumping yard,” he added. “I feel suffocated everyday because of garbage burning outside my home. I don’t know if the neighbours or sanitary workers are doing it. The authorities concerned should take some strict measures to stop this,” said Shubham Chaturvedi, resident of Jiamau, Gomtinagar. Several residents at Latouche Road pointed out wires and cycle tubes are also burnt by some in the area. Anuj Verma, a resident, said, “This area has lots of electronics and cycle repair shops, all the waste from them is thrown on roads and later burnt by the sweepers in the morning. Our locality has three patients suffering from asthma, but they don't care.” Additional municipal commissioner Abhay Pandey said, “If any worker is found to be burning garbage, then their salaries will be deducted. Citizens can also lodge complaints regarding garbage burning on “Lucknow One” app so we can take action on the offenders."

The signing took place in Glasgow at the United Nations Conference on Climate Change COP26. The state EV Policy, which was approved in July this year, aims to have a 10% share of electric vehicles in total registrations by 2025. It also targets conversion of 15 % of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) fleet into electric by 2025. The policy provides fiscal incentives for EV buyers and for their manufacturers along with subsidies for creation of charging infrastructure. As per a press release by the state government, RMI is a 40-year-old non-profit working on clean energy transitions globally. “In Maharashtra, RMI has already been engaging with city of Pune through its City EV Accelerator platform to make Pune EV-ready. We look forward to further our partnership on electric mobility, ZEV, hydrogen fuel and decarbonisation our transport sector and urban renewal sector” said state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray at the signing of the MoU. Highlighting the need to mobilize climate finance, CEO of RMI Jule Kortenhorst said, “Maharashtra is showing the leadership for climate action by sub-national governments. The size and scale of economic growth in the state provides it the unique opportunity to leapfrog to clean and modern energy systems and be the role model for sub-national governments, not just in India, but globally.” Meanwhile, Thackeray was invited by the UNFCCC high-level champions for a one-on-one chat with the First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon who “commended the sheer scale at which Maharashtra government is working to decarbonise the state”. During the interaction, the minister emphasized that it will be up to the administrative officers and elected representatives across all tiers of the government to lead and inspire sustainable development for Maharashtra. He further announced that the Maharashtra Council for Climate Change will convene to chart out a decarbonisation pathway for the state, under the chairmanship of the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. “Climate is karma, it will do to you what you do to the planet. It will not discriminate between the developing and developed. It will hit us all regardless of who or where we are,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/maha-signs-mou-with-us-org-for-ev-policy-tech-support/articleshow/87654962.cms||Manka Behl

Senior NU officials told TOI that despite their opposition to release dues of the ‘blacklisted’ company, vice-chancellor Subhash Chaudhari had gone ahead under “obvious political pressure” from political leaders in Mumbai having their stake in the Pune company. Fed up with its miserable services, Chaudhari’s predecessor SP Kane had decided to oust MKCL from the university and also stopped its dues worth around Rs3.60 crore in 2015-16, as claimed by MKCL. NU had purchased 32 lakh shares of the company that time. TOI had been tracking the MKCL’s entry and exit by exposing on how it miserably failed to provide services in various universities, which then ousted it and some even put it into the blacklist. It recently reported on how VC had decided to re-introduce MKCL, ignoring stiff opposition from the statutory members. Chaudhari did not pick up TOI’s repeated calls or respond to text messages as usual. Even MKCL mentor and former chairman Vivek Sawant too failed to respond. The Pune company had agreed to provide 14 services as per pact in 2005-06. It had proposed to build an interactive web-portal which will have large applications like exam forms, results, online tutorials, university news, and important educational links, on the lines of other big portals. The company charged Rs50 from NU’s four lakh students under its ‘e-suvidha’ project since beginning but failed to start the services. Subsequently, NU held up its payments worth Rs1.64 crore. Following NU’s reluctance to pay Rs3.60 crore dues for over three years, MKCL snapped ties and withdrew services. Subsequently, NU’s web portal where students used to get their admission cards, enrolment numbers and hall tickets was also stopped that time leading to a complete mess. Due to MKCL’s move, the exam work, especially generation of hall-tickets and of results, was also severely affected. Other companies like Promarc came to NU’s rescue by doing the same work in just one fourth price. According to NU officials, MKCL outsourcing the work to a franchisee was the root cause of all controversies. The outsourcing clause was not mentioned in the agreement. MKCL’s franchisee coordinator had dispatched over 100 reminders to NU for payment of dues that he claimed swelled to Rs 3.60 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ignoring-opp-from-own-officials-nu-releases-rs1-37cr-mkcls-dues/articleshow/87654254.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Officials of the education department have ordered a probe into the incident. The principal of Jageshwar Inter college, Neura in Magraura block in Pratapgarh district has been accused of writing the remark. When the family members of the victim made efforts to know about the reason behind writing the derogatory words on the transfer certificate, the principal refused to entertain them, saying that the student would not get admission in any college of the country. District Inspector of School (DIOS) Pratapgar, Sarvadanand told TOI that the matter came to the notice of the education department officials through IGRS portal. The DIOS further added that a detailed probe has been ordered and action would be initiated once the probe report comes in. He, however, said that putting such remark on the transfer certificate of any student was not justified. He said that officials are probing the facts related to the issue and action would be initiated. He also claimed that he had talked to college authorities regarding the issue and the matter would be solved soon. Initial reports claimed that two groups of students were at loggerheads on college campus on October 27 and following the incident, school authorities had initiated action and punished some errant students, including the victim. The victim student, who was allegedly punished with other students, had sought the transfer certificate from the college authorities after having a disagreement with them and the principal of the college had allegedly written the remark on his TC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/principal-writes-objectionable-remark-on-students-tc-edu-dept-orders-probe/articleshow/87654256.cms||---

---||Delhi||Separate annual licence for serving liquor at banquet halls, farmhouses, motels||New Delhi: There is no need to get a temporary P-10 license to serve liquor at weddings, parties or other events at banquet halls, farmhouses, motels, party places and other such venues. Under the Delhi government’s new excise policy, licensed venues can now get an annual L-38 license for a fee ranging from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 15 lakh, based on its carpet area. The P-10 license allows the serving of Indian liquor and foreign liquor at premises that do not have the licence. The fee was Rs 15,000 per event for farmhouses and banquet halls. The new L-38 license, however, would now be mandatory for venues that conduct multiple events. Venues with a carpet area of up to 5,000 square feet will have to pay an annual fee of Rs 5 lakh. For sites with carpet areas between 5,000 and 15,000 square feet, the fee would be Rs 10 lakh, and Rs 15 lakh would be the cost for venues with a carpet area above 15,000 square feet. The entire rented area will be calculated, including all the floors where events are held in a venue with multiple floors. As per an order regarding the terms and conditions for grant of licenses in form L-38 for liquor service at licensed premises, no separate P-10 license will be required for events once the yearly license is acquired. The L-38 license holder will have to issue a letter mentioning the date of the event, the number of guests and such other details to the host of the event to enable them to procure the liquor from a licensed source in Delhi. Also, the licensee is not allowed to sell or deliver any liquor to any person under the age prescribed by the Delhi Excise Act. The licensee also can’t keep, distribute, or sell any advertising material that is likely or intended to promote the sale or consumption of liquor. They also can’t display any bottle containing liquor or even an empty liquor bottle or specimen in a show window, except at the bar counter. Venues like farmhouses, banquet halls and motels with an L-38 licence will be allowed to host any entertainment activities such as live singing performances by professionals, dancing, karaoke and live bands. However, the host of the event will have to produce the purchase invoice if demanded by excise officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/separate-annual-licence-for-serving-liquor-at-banquet-halls-farmhouses-motels/articleshow/87655525.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Kolkata||‘BJP fascism’ kicked out film from IFFI: Bratya||Kolkata: Bratya Basu’s ‘Dictionary’ has got embroiled in a controversy of spelling errors at its Indian Panorama selection for the 52nd edition of Indian International Film Festival (IFFI) that begins in Goa on November 20. While the apparent reason for sudden exclusion of the film after being included from the Indian Panorama list has been attributed to a spelling error of his name, Basu doesn’t rule out political vendetta. In a congratulatory letter to the director and producer of ‘Dictionary’ on November 5, Directorate of Film Festivals additional director general Chaitanya Prasad invited both for its screening on November 22 at 10am. The letters also had details about their to-and-fro travel plans to Goa and also requested nominations of two members of the cast to be present as guests. According to instructions, producer Firdausul Hasan sent one DCP, two Blu Rays and two DVD copies of the film. However, on November 6, Directorate of Film Festivals/International Film Festival of India deputy director Tanu Rai sent a letter to Film Federation of India (FFI), saying that “a serious technical flaw” has been observed “wherein in the FFI recommendation letter the name of the director of the Bengali film ‘Dictionary’ is different from the application form and credit title of the film”. He had referred to the letter FFI general secretary had sent to Indian Panorama on August 4 this year, nominating ‘Dictionary’ for consideration which had misspelt the director’s name as ‘Dutta Basu’ instead of Bratya Basu. In his letter to FFI, Rai said: “In view of the said discrepancy, the selection of the film in Indian Panorama stands null and void. Hence the film shall not be part of Indian Panorama official selection. It is hereby requested that the director and producer of the film may kindly be informed about the same. Any invitation extended on behalf of this film is also withdrawn. In view of the aforesaid, FFI may like to recommend fresh films for Mainstream Cinema Section as per the regulations and will be examined as per rules. This has the approval of ADG, DFF.” A new press release was issued on November 6 where ‘Dictionary’ was excluded. At the press conference, Basu said such reasons for exclusion smack of “political vendetta” and “BJP’s fascism”. He didn’t rule out chances that initial appreciation of the film happened without the jury being aware of his political identity. “I am a member of Trinamool. Mamata Banerjee is my leader. I will not stop my protests against BJP because of this incident. I will continue doing the work that I have been doing in both my political and cultural space. Trinamool will be in power in Goa. My leader has gone there. I will go there too.” Meanwhile, Hasan said that errors, if any, ought to have been checked before the initial announcements were made. “Such exclusion for no fault of mine is hugely demoralizing.

This could be possible only when they are well-informed about the glorious past of the university and the great names it has produced,” she added. The VC further told TOI, “For making the students, both who are already enrolled on the campus and also those who would become part of AU in coming years, aware with regard to the glorious past of AU and also who all were the world-renowned personalities that AU had produced, this museum has been conceptualised.” AU stalwarts, ranging from late President Shankar Dayal Sharma to late Prime Ministers Chandra Shekhar and VP Singh and the former five-time Prime Minister of Nepal Surya Bahadur Thapa besides noted poets and writers like Firaq Gorakhpuri and Harivansh Rai Bachchan as well as scientists like noted astrophysicist Meghnad Saha among others, would be a part of the proposed museum. The museum would be established at one of the halls of building near the historical Vizayanagram Hall of the science faculty campus of the Central varsity. Although the museum would have busts or murals of these stalwarts, it would be decided in due course of time as AU has to garner funds for this proposed museum. “We would have to arrange funds for establishing the museum which aims to motivate students of the city to pursue higher education and research at AU and not move to other cities. The funds could come through corporate social responsibility (CSR),” said Prof Srivastava. There are educational institutions across the world which have similar museums and even have tickets for visiting the museum. Why can’t we have something here at AU which too has produced legendary figures in all spheres, she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/au-vc-proposes-setting-up-museum-of-varsity-stalwarts/articleshow/87654267.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Video of BJP MP losing cool on not finding her photo at PMC goes viral||Revised Prayagraj: A video of Prayagraj MP Rita Bahuguna Joshi getting upset over her photograph, and of another former mayor of the city, being missing from the wall of the Prayagraj Municipal Corporation, and pulling up officials concerned has gone viral on the social media. The incident is said to be of Tuesday during the house meeting of PMC when the MP lost her cool on finding her photograph missing and snapped saying that all photographs on display are of leaders who have passed away (sporting garlands) and not a single photograph of a leader alive has been put on display. “I was shocked to see how disorganised they are. The walls did not have a picture of any of the former mayors of the city, be it Shyama Charan Gupta, Jitendra Nath Singh or myself. On being asked, I was told that the pictures have been damaged by termites. If that was the case, they could have put a new picture or could have asked us. But that was brazen on their part of not having a picture of former mayors” said BJP MP, Rita Joshi while talking to TOI. She further said, “Look for example how organised the administration of Hindustani Academy is, but here at PMC, they had pictures of leaders who have passed away, garlands hanging from the photo frame. I have suggested placing the picture of our respected posthumous leaders at one wall and that of the former mayors on one wall. It would then look more organised.” Commenting on the issue, public relation officer of PMC and tax officer, PK Mishra said, “It was just that the respected MP had pointed out that that pictures of former mayors were not to be seen and we told her that since the pictures have been damaged because of termites and the sadan is being renovated, fresh pictures would be placed on the walls in due course of time”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/video-of-bjp-mp-losing-cool-on-not-finding-her-photo-at-pmc-goes-viral/articleshow/87654274.cms||---

Nadda arrived in Mumbai on Thursday evening and spoke to BJP leaders and workers at a welcome event in Andheri (East). “We always take forward nationalist ideals under the leadership of PM Modi, and are strengthening the country. We have also vowed to take Maharashtra forward. “The weather is not the same all the time... When the sun is hidden, nationalist powers are a little hurt for some time but this doesn’t mean that nationalist powers won’t go forward with full power. They will, and in the days to come, in Maharashtra too, the BJP’s flag will fly high,” Nadda said after landing in Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bjp-will-uproot-corrupt-govt-in-a-democratic-way-in-mumbai-nadda/articleshow/87655892.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Kolkata||Mother-son duo performs at UN climate summit||Kolkata: The mother-son duo of Sohini Roychowdhury and Rishi Dasgupta performed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow on Thursday. In a world ravaged by the pandemic, this two-week summit is a critical test of global cooperation to address the climate crisis. Describing her invitation to perform on the sidelines as part of COP26 cultural expressions as the “turning point” of her life, the Bharatnatyam dancer and choreographer said: “I was approached by Tami Pein who is the COP26 Events and Venue Coordinator of Stop Climate Chaos Scotland. This invitation means the world to me and I am honoured to be performing at the most important climate-related conference on the planet.” This is the first time the mother and son performed together at a physical event. The venue — an iconic Baroque church called Adelaide Place — was also special for the duo. “The church was founded in 1829 and the present church building dates from 1877. As a Kolkatan, I feel proud that my son and I have received this opportunity,” she added. Dasgupta is currently studying economics at St Andrews University in Scotland. “I'm in a new place but with familiar faces. So, in a way, it feels nostalgic as well as new and exciting,” Dasgupta said. Roychowdhury believes her long association with ‘Nature and I’ projects might have influenced her selection as one of the performers. This project has been presented in the form of dance workshops, concerts and storytelling with dance formats both in Kolkata and various cities of Europe. The 20-minute-long programme saw the duo perform a version of ‘Nature and Us’ by using Shiva stotrams. “There is an umbilical connection between Purush and Prakriti. Exploring this connection is perhaps the best tribute we could have given to the central thought of COP26,” she said. Once the programme was over, the audience reaction left Roychowdhury overwhelmed. "People from all over the world, including children, attended our performance. It was such an emotional moment for me to see so many connecting with our art form," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mother-son-duo-performs-at-un-climate-summit/articleshow/87654294.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Pune||Another new low for the date as minimum temp dips to 10.9°C||Pune: The city experienced its coldest morning of the season on Thursday with the minimum temperature sliding to 10.9° celsius from Wednesday’s 11.8° celsius, the lowest in comparison to any other location in Maharashtra, India Meteorological Department data showed. Thursday’s minimum temperature in Shivajinagar was almost five degrees below the normal. Shivajinagar was also among the locations in India which are currently experiencing the lowest minimum temperatures (barring hill stations). The minimum temperature on Thursday was also Pune’s second lowest November minimum since 2017 when it was 11.4 on November 13. On November 12 in 2020, the minimum temperature had dropped to 9.8° celsius, the lowest November minimum since 2017. Thursday’s minimum was thus the second lowest November night temperature since then. The lowest minimum temperature of 9.5°C was reported at Raisen (West Madhya Pradesh) over the plains . Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting division, IMD, Pune told TOI, “After the passage of a recent western disturbance over North India, the wind direction changed causing cold north-easterly winds to penetrate into parts of North Madhya Maharashtra and neighbourhood. The winds were passing through the cold regions of Madhya Pradesh before entering Maharashtra, causing minimums to drop in many parts of the state.” However, the depression over southwest and adjoining west-central Bay of Bengal, which was likely to cross north Tamil Nadu and adjoining south Andhra Pradesh coasts close to Chennai on Thursday evening/night would cause clouding, thunder, light rain activity in parts of southcentral and South Maharashtra during the next few days, causing minimum temperatures to rise significantly here, even in Pune. “As per IMD’s extended range forecast for the next two weeks, the chill may be missing from Maharashtra till around November 25 owing to several weather conditions, including the likely formation of a fresh low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/another-new-low-for-the-date-as-minimum-temp-dips-to-10-9c/articleshow/87654289.cms||Neha Madaan

The accused, Ramnagesh Akubathini, claimed that he posted the threats to the cricketer’s Twitter handle after there was an exchange of words between two groups — one supporting the cricketer and the other GappistanRadio— which the techie supports. Akubathini told the cyber police at the Bandra-Kurla Complex where he will be in police custody till November 15 that he regretted his action. If convicted, he could be jailed for a maximum period of three years with a fine of Rs five lakh for publishing or transmitting material depicting children in the sexually explicit act in electronic form. DCP (Mumbai-Cyber) Rashmi Karandikar said a case was filed against Akubathini last week with the Delhi police on a complaint from the Delhi Commission for Women after the accused posted the tweet. Akubathini, a state topper and an IIT pass out from Hyderabad, was part of the group that had an exchange of words with another group after India lost the T20 World Cup match on October 24 against arch-rival Pakistan. “Akubathini, who worked with a Bengaluru-based startup, had constantly altered his profile on social media to troll the cricketer before he was finally tracked down,” said cyber police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/rape-threats-to-cricketers-child-remand-for-hyd-techie-in-mumbai/articleshow/87655948.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Mumbai||Student suicides up 11% in Maharashtra in 2020, but fewer ‘exam failure’ victims||MUMBAI: Keeping with the national trend of suicides among students increasing in the Covid year of 2020, Maharashtra also saw an uptick in the numbers from 2019. The state has the dubious record of registering the highest suicides among students. The latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report showed that 1,648 students in Maharashtra died by suicide in 2020. Odisha (1,469), Madhya Pradesh (1,158) and Tamil Nadu (930) were the other states with high student suicides. Though many believe the Covid-hit 2020 was relatively easier on the academic front due to cancelled or curtailed examinations, more students than ever before ended their lives in the state. The 2020 tally of 1,648 was higher (11%) than the previous years: 1,487 in 2019, 1,448 in 2018, 1,437 in 2017 and 1,350 in 2016. The nationwide tally of death by suicide among students stood at 12,526, about 21% more than the 2019 toll of 10,335. “Among all Indian states, Maharashtra has always registered the highest suicides among students because it is a ‘metropolitan state’ with high aspirations and high expectations,” said psychiatrist Harish Shetty. A public hospital doctor said the numbers are higher than in other states because of better reporting in the public health system. Psychiatrist Kersi Chavda contended that the biggest cause for suicide in any age group continues to be depression. “Some students struggle to cope,” he said, adding that the pandemic worsened the pitch for many. “In the last two years, due to Covid’s strong effect on the economy, many people with largely balanced lives ended up with not-so-balanced lives. People developed relationship issues, economic hardships, and students also had anxiety over future education or admission,” he said. For its accidental deaths and suicides report, the NCRB collates data under the heads of causes, such as “bankruptcy or indebtedness”, “marriage issues”, “failure in exams”, and so on. Maharashtra again topped the “failure in exams” category in 2020. Across the country, there was a 25% drop in deaths by suicide due to “failure in exams” — from 2,744 in 2019 to 2,080 in 2020. In Maharashtra, too, 287 students killed themselves for that reason compared to 439 in 2019 and 390 in 2018. Experts explained that studies are not the only reason for students to take their lives. “Indians don’t want to discuss parenting as an issue. But in 2020, many youngsters had a harrowing time because they were confined to home with parents who had different ideologies,” said psychologist Varkha Chulani. Youngsters not only had to deal with interpersonal strife, but also some harsh economic developments. The lack of access to a mental health support system, especially in non-metro areas, often worsens emotional turmoil among youngsters, added Shetty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-student-suicides-up-11-in-state-in-20-but-fewer-exam-failure-victims/articleshow/87655559.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Nagpur||Like polio, door-to-door Covid vax drive across Nagpur from November 20||NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has planned a massive door-to-door 10-day Covid vaccination drive on the lines of polio campaign from November 20 to attain the last mile coverage. The zilla parishad has already deployed teams in rural parts to reach out to unvaccinated people. The initiatives are part of Har Ghar Dastak drive launched as per central and state government orders. Though different measures are in place to incentivize vaccination, authorities are leaving nothing to chance to reach out to every citizen in the district. Both the local bodies have made vaccination a must for entry in public offices, to avail government schemes and use public utilities. Similar measures have been adopted in each of the 11 districts in Vidarbha to complete the first dose of eligible population by November 30. In Chandrapur, the civic body has initiated a bumper vaccination draw awarding LED TV, fridge, washing machine, etc to woo beneficiaries beside curbing movement of unvaccinated persons. In Amravati, Muslim maulavis were urged by municipal commissioner to create awareness about vaccination among community members. The number of doses at different vaccination centres have been increased between 300 and 500 there. In Nagpur, over 600 teams would be fanning out across the city under ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ drive to inoculate unvaccinated citizens with the first dose. An estimated seven lakh people in the district are yet to take their first dose. The NMC has been running door-to-door drive but not covering every home in the city. The drive was limited to areas having poor vaccination percentage. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI a plan similar to the polio campaign has been drawn. “Polio campaign spans five days as neighbours help health workers in tracing kids. ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ will take around 10 days as teams will have to confirm by actually enquiring at each house,” he said. He further said that all civic health staffers would be deployed along with malaria and filaria teams. “Nursing colleges too have been requested to help us with volunteers. Asha workers will also join. Around 550 to 600 teams each having a health worker and non-clinical person will spread out in the city. One medical officer will supervise 10 to 15 teams in each area,” he said. The NMC has enough doses and it has been assured of continuous supply to meet the requirement. Joshi further said that the warning about stopping the free first dose from December 1 has helped increase vaccination. “We aim to complete first dose in this drive but if someone is due for second dose it will also be given. Later, citizens can visit any centre for second dose,” he said. Zilla Parishad CEO Yogesh Kumbhejkar said they are already reaching out to low performing blocks at district health officer level. “We are holding camps at different rural places. Depending on specific area need, the camp would be extended there under ‘Har Ghar Dastak’,” said the CEO. According to Kumbhejkar, industries, housing societies and educational institutions with high number of unvaccinated or those with second dose are being covered. “All departments are coordinating and instructions have been given to taluka-level Covid task force to assist health workers. We are aiming to complete the overall backlog,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/like-polio-door-to-door-covid-vax-drive-across-city-from-nov-20/articleshow/87655016.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Kolkata||Health priority for MP funds, courtesy Covid||Kolkata: Bengal MPs cutting across party lines want to do their bit in the Covid battle with the Rs 2-crore MPLAD fund which is likely to be released before March 2022. Ironically, it was due to Covid that the MPLAD funds were halted by the Centre in 2020 for managing health services and Covid impacts. Kolkata South MP Mala Ray cites a personal example. "Before the funds were halted, I had used part of my 2019-20 allocation to procure, among other things, eight ambulances and five hearse vans. During the pandemic, these were used by KMC. It helped people in distress. If permitted, I would like to do more to help the state, and KMC, in its Covid battle,” Ray says. Jadavpur MP and actor Mimi Chakraborty highlighted the problems faced. “For the last one and a half years, we could not spend anything as the MPLAD funds got halted. Common people do not understand the nuances, but they feel that the MP has not responded to their needs. I am happy that I can start working on the schemes again,” she said. Barasat MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar said most part of her 2019-20 funds was spent to convert Barasat hospital into a medical college. “I will use for health and conservancy purpose in my constituency,” she said. Krishnagore MP Mahua Moitra is among the few leaders who will be able to spend more than the Centre’s MPLAD allocation. “Before the embargo, I had submitted my utilisation certificates for Rs 2.5 crore for 2020-21. This was sanctioned. I expect another Rs 2 crore to be released soon,” she said. “Rs 2 crore is not a big amount, but I am very keen to take up small projects like bus shelter, ambulance or a room for any school. But the MPs need cooperation from the local administration before that,” said BJP’s national vice-president and Midnapore MP Dilip Ghosh. Bengal BJP president and Balurghat MP Sukanta Majumdar said: “There are projects related to water supply that are crucial to my constituency. We have started work on those projects. We have given money to rural hospitals for buying generators, halls, or rooms for doctors.” CPM Rajya Sabha MP Bikash Bhattacharya said: “Until I get any fund I cannot comment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/health-priority-for-mp-funds-courtesy-covid/articleshow/87654302.cms||Rohit Khanna

Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) data shows that as many as 9,30,754 people in the city remain partially vaccinated. Of this, 2,58,314 beneficiaries are overdue by more than six weeks for their second dose.

The civic body also converted five AMTS and one BRTS bus into mobile vaccination centres. The civic body started doorstep vaccination service for those who were physically challenged or aged 50 and above. “Despite all our efforts, it is very unfortunate that the city still has over 9 lakh people who have shown carelessness by not taking their second dose. At a time when we are witnessing a surge in Covid cases in other states in the country, this definitely is not the time to show such negligence,” said a senior AMC official. The official said that the highest number of overdue vaccinated people, 1,60,192, are from North Zone that includes areas such as Sardarnagar, Krishnagar, Saijpur, Naroda and Kubernagar. “The second highest number of people who have not yet taken their second dose are residents of West Zone where 1,52,890 are yet to take the second vaccine dose,” the official said.

The official said that as of November 11, AMC has administered a total of 73.84 lakh vaccine doses in the city out of which 46.91 lakh were first doses while the remaining 26.93 lakh were second doses of vaccine. “To increase second dose coverage we have now decided against allowing people entry to AMC-run public facilities and will also request other private organizations to do the same,” the official said. He added that those who have not taken the second dose and want to will be directed to the nearest booth to take their second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/9-3-lakh-eligible-amdavadis-yet-to-take-their-second-jab/articleshow/87654340.cms||---

After discontinuing the practice in the last week of May, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation brought back the practice of setting up micro containment zones on Thursday as Gujarat and Ahmedabad marked an upward trend in cases for the second consecutive day with 40 and 14 cases respectively. The new micro containment zone contains as many as 20 houses with 85 residents, all in one block of a five-storeyed apartment. “One or two family members from each floor have tested Covid positive so we have decided to declare the block as a micro containment zone. We have also decided to resume the practice of announcing micro containment zones as we go further,” an AMC official said. The official said that the practice of declaring micro containment zones was discontinued in May when positive cases in the city had started showing a decline after peaking in April. The city had recorded the peak in the number of Covid cases in April. On April 25, the city had recorded 5,790 Covid cases — the highest. This had come down to 803 positive cases on May 21.

It took several rounds of questioning for investigators to discover the hiding place. The chain was finally retrieved from the groove above the compartment's door after Western Railways helped the cops track down the location of the coach. The accused, Dipesh Surve, 29, is a history sheeter. The theft was reported at Dadar station on the eve of Diwali on November 3. Shrikant Shirgavkar, a 47-year-old passenger, was trying to board a Goregaon bound slow local from platform no. 1 around 6pm. He suddenly felt someone tug at his gold chain. Shirgavkar got off the coach and raised an alarm. A team of policemen and women patrolling the platform heard him and started to chase the accused (Surve). To escape from the cops, Surve got into a coach and went to the opposite door but could not find a way to hop out. He then held on to the roof by sliding his fingers into a groove above the door. "Surve was walking away when he suddenly realised that he had found a perfect hiding place for the chain. He went back to the door and slid the chain into the groove. His plan was to retrieve the chain after his release from the police station," said investigating officer Nandkishore Jadhav. The police team caught hold of Surve soon after and took him to the Mumbai Central GRP chowky. But he told him he had dropped the chain during the chase. The cops did not buy his story and quizzed him for two days, trying every trick in the book from threatening him with serious charges to appealing to the goodness in him. "We told him that he had stolen someone's gold around Diwali and ruined the festival for that family," a police officer said. Eventually, Surve caved in and revealed the chain's hiding place. The next challenge was tracking down the coach. Cops viewed CCTV footage of the theft and checked the train concerned. But it turned out that they had got the wrong coach. The cops then took help from Western Railways and tracked the coach with the gold chain to the Kandivali carshed. On November 6, a police team escorted Surve to the carshed and put up ladders to reach the rooftop. They checked every inch of the groove before the chain worth Rs 40000 could finally be recovered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-snatcher-hides-stolen-gold-chain-in-train-roof-groove/articleshow/87655951.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Ahmedabad||Access to civic facilities only if you’re fully vaccinated||AHMEDABAD: It is the holidays, and if you plan to spend some of your free time at the Sabarmati riverfront, Kankaria lakefront or the zoo, be sure you have taken both the shots and are carrying your vaccine certificate to gain entry. As the Covid curve rises in the city once again, the civic body has once again banned those who have not been vaccinated from using public facilities, like civic transport service and from entering public spaces. However, unlike the last time, the rule, which comes into effect from Friday, also restricts access to those who have taken only the first dose of Covid vaccine. Earlier in September, AMC had announced that only those who had got at least one dose of vaccine will be able to avail of various municipal services. Ahmedabad was the first among cities in India to make vaccination mandatory to access civic body-run facilities, services and buildings. “AMC has decided against allowing people who are not fully vaccinated in AMC-run facilities such as city civic centres, AMC buildings, gyms, sports complexes, swimming pools and even aboard AMTS and BRTS buses. This rule will come into effect from Friday,” said AMC’s standing committee chairman Hitesh Barot. He said that vaccine certificates shall be checked at entry point of such facilities. “People who want access to these facilities will have to show Covid vaccination certificate (physical or digital) of both the doses,” an AMC health department official said. The civic body officials said that the move is to give impetus to the ongoing drive to fully vaccinate the city's population. The officer said that the civic body has set up a number of vaccination booths at AMTS, BRTS stands, at civic centres, community centres, at shopping malls and hospitals. AMC to increase Covid testing Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation will also increase Covid testing activity as positive cases are showing a rise after the festive season. “We have decided to increase testing activity at various entry points in the city as the cases are on the rise. If needed we will set up testing domes at state transport bus stands, railway stations and, if needed, at road entry points,” said a senior AMC. The officer said that currently the civic body is carrying out around 2,000 testing every day in the city which will be doubled if needed. AMC standing committee chairman Hitesh Barot said that the civic body is currently surveying people who have tested Covid positive. “The civic body has started tracing contact history of people who have tested positive. We are surveying and if needed we will set up testing domes at every entry point,” Barot said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/access-to-civic-facilities-only-if-youre-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/87654343.cms||---

The renovated lake was formally inaugurated on February 20 last year. After its formal inauguration, the facilities developed around the lake were not open for public use in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. A raging second wave of the pandemic had hit the city soon after the inauguration. Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) standing committee chairman Dr Hitendra Patel said that the borders of the lake have steps and benches where people can spend time. Patel said the lake was renovated at the cost of Rs 34 crore. “We could not allow people in it in the wake of Covid-19. Now, it will remain open from 6am to 8am and 5pm to 8pm. The decision was taken as Covid-19 cases have come down,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/sursagar-opened-for-public/articleshow/87654022.cms||---
---||Chennai||TN: Weightage for internal marks in engineering up from 20% to 40%||CHENNAI: For students of affiliated colleges of Anna University stuttering at 60% overall fail rate, here is some good news. The university’s new regulation for 2021 has doubled the internal assessment weightage for awarding marks from 20% to 40%. The cumulative grade point average (CGPA) for getting first class has also been brought down from 7 CGPA to 6.5 CGPA. Just 25% of engineering students cleared all the subjects in the first semester in January 2019, shows data. The new regulation also allows students to take a study break for up to a year for job or entrepreneurship and has scrapped a 2017 rule that mandated students to compulsorily complete arrears in four attempts. Students can also do up to two online courses in a semester against one course under current rule. “Earlier, study break was allowed only on medical grounds,” an official said. The new changes were part of the university’s plan to impart uniformity in engineering education offered at affiliated colleges, autonomous colleges, and university departments. While affiliated colleges follow an 80%:20% weightage system for end-semester exams and internal tests, autonomous colleges and university departments follow 60%:40% and 50%: 50% weightage system. As per the new regulation, theory courses with laboratory components will have 50%:50% weightage for end-semester exams and internal assessment. For laboratory courses, it will be 60% weightage for internal assessment in end-semester exams. The number of internal assessments has also been brought down from three to two per semester. “There will be two internal assessments in each semester and each assessment will be conducted for 100 marks. An individual assignment or case study or seminar or mini project will carry 40 marks while a written test will be conducted for 60 marks. The candidate’s score for 200 marks will be converted to 40 marks,” the regulations said. End-semester exams will be conducted for 100 marks and the score will be converted into 60 marks. Anna University vice-chancellor R Velraj said, “The university wanted to bring uniformity among all engineering colleges. The new regulations will give more flexibility to students.” As per the earlier regulation, students must complete arrears in four attempts, else they may have to redo the course in fifth semester. “Engineering colleges said students with arrears were discontinuing courses and joining deemed universities. So, the regulation was dropped,” V-C said. The university has also allowed students to appear for arrear exams in subsequent semesters. As per the existing rule, a student can clear arrears from an odd semester only in the next odd semester when the course is offered again. “If a student couldn’t clear in three attempts, then the minimum 50% marks in end-semester exam alone can be declared pass,” the new regulations said. P Deiva Sundari, principal, KCG College of Technology, said, “The increase in weightage for internal assessment including assignment and case studies, mini projects will help students to get more active learning. It has given more space for outcome-based education.” “Pass mark for end-semester exam has been retained at 45 to ensure that there is no dilution of standards in evaluating students,” she added. The university also introduced a new grade “C”. “Students who clear the exam with 50 marks will get C grade,” an official from the university said. The university has also included science club, literary club and fine arts club apart from NCC and NSS to inculcate scientific temper among students. “All colleges are encouraged to start these clubs. Students are encouraged to participate in any of these clubs as part of extra-curricular activities,” the official added. The new regulations also introduce project work in the pre-final semester for engineering students. Some professors, however, said the university needs to evolve a proper mechanism to monitor affiliated colleges to see that they award marks in internal assessment based on impartial evaluation. “If we apply relative grading for thousands of students in a subject, it won’t make much of a difference,” B Chidambararajan, principal, SRM Valliammai Engineering College, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/weightage-for-internal-marks-in-engineering-up-from-20-to-40/articleshow/87655019.cms||A Ragu Raman

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: MBBS student stabbed to death at Yavatmal GMC||YAVATMAL: A MBBS final year student of Vasantrao Naik Government Medical College (GMC) was stabbed to death on Wednesday night on the college campus. The murder triggered a protest by students who demanded immediate arrest of the assailants and resignation of dean Dr Milind Kamble. Dr Kamble said the hospital lodged an FIR against the unidentified assailants on Wednesday night. Police arrested two suspects on Wednesday midnight and their interrogation is in progress, said SP Dilip Patil-Bhujbal. On Thursday, the two suspects were granted PCR till November 15 after they were produced in court. Sources said the unidentified assailants intercepted the deceased, identified as Ashok Pal, a resident of Thane, on the road leading to the new boys hostel when he was returning from the college library around 8.30pm. Fellow students and passers-by spotted Pal lying in a pool of blood and rushed him to the hospital. Some of the students said there was a quarrel between them and some outsiders in August. The dean did not rule out an act of revenge behind the murder. Pal suffered deep wounds inflicted by sharp weapons. The post mortem was conducted in the hospital and the uncle of the deceased claimed the body which was taken to his native place Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh on Thursday. Students staying in the hostels reached the hospital after learning about the murder on Wednesday night and started shouting slogans against the college administration and the police. They also launched an indefinite strike at the main gate. SP Bhujbal, additional SP Khanderao Dharne, city police station officer Nandkishilor Pant, Awadootwadi PSO Manoj Khandare, LCB chief Pradeep Pardeshi and a police team rushed to the college. The SP and collector Amol Yedge, who also visited the college, assured the students of immediate arrests in the case and appealed to them to maintain peace. Dean Dr Kamble said he is ready to step down from the post if it would help solve the issue. He has sent his resignation letter to the director of medical education and research. The collector said that all measures will be taken to prevent such incidents in future. “The administration would send a proposal to the state government to grant adequate compensation to the next of the kin of the deceased medico,” he said. Students said life of a brilliant student was lost due to lapses of the college administration. They alleged that there are no CCTV cameras and street lights on the campus roads. The college administration was apprised of the situation on many occasions but it turned a blind eye, they said. They also claimed there is no adequate security arrangements in the college. The OPD was closed on Thursday due to the strike. Patients coming from far off places faced hardship as the main gates were closed. After a quarrel between the students and outsiders in August, the city police had registered an FIR against both sides. The issue was amicably settled after councillor Nitin Mirzapure intervened. The students and the outsiders moved a joint application before the police saying that they have settled the issue and didn’t want to go ahead with the FIR. Dean Dr Kamble said, “This might be the reason behind the murder. But the victim was a calm person.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mbbs-student-stabbed-to-death-at-yavatmal-gmc/articleshow/87655027.cms||---

Later, he participated in ‘Gopashtami’ festival at Gendikhata, inaugurated Krishi Mela at Manubas village in Jwalapur assembly constituency and then laid the foundation stone of a residential project at SIDCUL. Speaking at the university, the CM referred to PM Narendra Modi's statement during his visit to Kedarnath on November 4. "The PM said that the next decade belongs to Uttarakhand. In the decade, the state will witness fast development in all fields and will eventually become India's number one state," he said. He added that the "PM visualised Kedarnath Dham as no one else had ever done. He was keen that the idea was translated into action". Once the projects, including cable cars for Hemkund Sahib as well as Kedarnath, get executed, the number of pilgrims visiting the famous shrines in Garhwal region will rise significantly," he hoped. University vice-chancellor Devi Prasad Tripathhi thanked the CM him for agreeing to expedite the payment of salary arrears to teachers in the university. Ranipur (Haridwar) MLA Adesh Chauhan, who raised the issue before the CM, said the teachers, as also the vice-chancellor, had been given a hike in their salaries as per the Seventh Pay Commission, but their arrears had not yet been paid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/dhami-inaugurates-sanskrit-varsitys-building/articleshow/87654313.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal
---||Lucknow||Bringing healthcare to people through sub centres for care||The Covid-19 pandemic has been successful in drawing attention to the larger issue of greater investment in the health sector. The government of India has recently launched a very ambitious centrally sponsored Health Infrastructure Mission for the same. This has shown that providing care to people close to their homes is an important issue to address different issues of healthcare, including epidemics. There are three hallmarks of a good healthcare system: accessibility, affordability and quality of care. We have seen in various parts of the country during the pandemic that early intervention and early medication proved to be life saving. This brings focus on the issue of accessibility of healthcare facilities, which is the foremost requirement for people. Only when a person is able to reach a facility does the question of affordability and quality arise. Since everyone does not own a transport and these facilities are not readily available in rural areas, the centre for primary healthcare must be close to home for people. Primary healthcare is provided by the primary health centres and sub health centres, which are gradually getting converted into health and wellness centres. A sub health centre remains the first port of call in rural areas. The norm is to have one sub centre for every 5,000 people in the plains and for every 3,000 in hilly and tribal areas. So, if a district has a rural population of 15 lakh in the plains, it should have 300 sub centres, uniformly distributed, in the district. Here comes the catch. Even if that particular district has 300 sub centres, it would not automatically ensure that every pocket of the district has good accessibility. This is because of faulty planning process. When we treat a district as the unit for planning, the healthcare facilities are located within the district but the distribution, more often than not, gets skewed. Further, these sub centres may not be constructed at the most appropriate location. This happens because a healthcare facility is treated as ‘social infrastructure’ for which land must come free of cost. We can spend Rs 30 lakh for constructing a health and wellness centre in a village but cannot spend Rs 3-4 lakh for procuring a suitable piece of land. This is not the case for roads, bridges, power stations or irrigation canals which are supposed to be ‘real infrastructure’. After constructing a sub centre on a free plot of land 2km from village habitation, we expect the auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) to stay there all alone. This is the reason why at many places, sub centres function sub-optimally and ANMs do not reside there. The answer to addressing the issue of accessibility is no rocket science and can be handled with some re-imagination. Firstly, we can decide that every gram panchayat will have at least one health sub centre. This will address the issue of equitable distribution of sub centres. In fact, we in UP are trying to address the issue of prior skewed distribution through scientific placement of 5,000 new sub centres. Secondly, since grant from the 15th Finance Commission is going to fund the construction of rural healthcare infrastructure, it makes sense to locate a facility in every gram panchayat. When under Right to Education, we appoint one teacher for every 25 students, is it too much to ask for one or two healthcare workers for the entire population of a gram panchayat? Thirdly, we must liberalize the norm and obtain/procure an appropriate piece of land, close to the village habitation, for health sub centres where the ANM can stay safely. This can be done by finding suitable government land or getting a suitable piece through exchange of land or even purchasing. Finally, since primary healthcare takes off the load from secondary and tertiary facilities; hence investing in this strategically would prove to be a game-changer for the healthcare scenario and would create space for augmenting quality of care. This would not only help us in normal times and epidemics/pandemic but would also take us towards universal health coverage.

And had the government not recently raised domestic fare bands by 12.5% some months back, there “won’t have been any airline left for us to board”, Union aviation minister Jyotiraditya M Scindia said at the Times Now Summit 2021 on Thursday. “We are seeing tremendous amount of green shoots. The last weekend saw a high of 3.8 lakh passengers daily, with the pre-Covid high being 4.2 lakh. So we are only 10% below the pre-Covid high. Almost 90% of (domestic) traffic has recovered. But it is important to be cautious,” he said. He said Air India will be transferred to its new owner, the Tata Group, by the third week of January 2022. The country will next year also see a startup, Akasa, take to the skies along with a reborn Jet Airways. TOI had last week reported that January 23 is the “long stop date” by which Tatas have to take over the airline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tatas-will-take-over-air-india-by-the-3rd-week-of-january-union-aviation-minister-jyotiraditya-m-scindia/articleshow/87656477.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Two held for trafficking Bangladeshi citizens||LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad (UP ATS) has busted a human trafficking gang that facilitated illegal entry of Bangladeshis and Rohingyas into India and then got their Indian passports made using fake Hindu identities and then sent them abroad. ATS teams arrested Sameer Mandal from West Bengal and Vikram Singh of Punjab from Ghaziabad. ATS officials recovered Indian passports of various names and addresses, Aadhaar and PAN cards, international Covid-19 stamped proformas, certificates, election voter ID cards, stamps, and passports from the possession of Vikram Singh and Sameer Mandal. Mandal runs foodgrain transport business that is spread to Bangladesh and had started tour and travel trade also and started facilitating illegal entry of Bangladeshis and Rohingyas into India. An ATS official privy to the probe said, “The gang had sent scores of Bangladeshi nationals and Rohingyas to Middle east, South Africa, Congo and other countries on Hindu identities and Indian passports.” Later, the accused blackmailed them and extract money by threatening to leak their real identities to authorities, the officer said. Inspector general, ATS, Gajendra Kumar Goswamy, said, “Sameer Mandal and Vikram Singh were arrested after their names were revealed by Mithun Mandal of Bengal, Shaon Ahmed, Mominur Islam and Mehndi Hasan, all of Bangladesh, who were nabbed on October 26.” “During questioning, Sameer revealed that one Saeed of Bangladesh who has fraudulently obtained the citizenship of South Africa, sent Bangladeshis to him. Saeed sent details on WhatsApp whenever a Bangladeshi crossed the border. Sameer took them to the house of his brother Subhash Mandal and got their fake Aadhaar card, PAN card, voter ID card and passport made by one Ratan Mandal,” said Goswamy. Another man in Bangladesh identified as Jehangir used to get Bangladeshis enter India illegally and sent them to Sameer for preparing their fake documents, the IG added. “Vikram Singh came in touch with one Gurpreet Singh, who lives in London and works in the passport office there, through social media and he also helped in making fake passports. About seven months ago, Vikram met Ratan Mandal through social media,” Goswamy said. “The gang also roped in others who helped the Bangladeshis and Rohingyas board flights without proper verification of documents. These people will also be identified, and action will be taken against them,” he added. The addresses mentioned in the passports were verified by police officers of respective states and were found to be fake. The RT-PCR test report and Covid vaccination report to travel abroad were also found to be fake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/2-held-for-trafficking-bangladeshi-citizens/articleshow/87655568.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Soon, faceless procedure for international driving permits||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat government will soon implement a faceless process for issuing international driving permits. This change has been implemented by the central government and will be put in place in the state after the Diwali break.  Officials of the Regional Transport Office (RTO) revealed the road transport ministry has already issued instructions, but the Gujarat transport department is giving final touches to its guidelines. Asking not to be named officials said that they have one request, for renewal of the international permit of a person in Europe, who has been stuck due to the lockdown in 2020 and recently sent a relative to the Ahmedabad RTO to renew his international driving permit. As the person was not present, his permit was not renewed, and permission was sought from higher up for the renewal. An officer said that the new system is at the trial stage and will be implemented soon after the Diwali break. The official said that using the new system, people will be able to apply online from anywhere. The applicant will have to log into the system using his Indian mobile number and authenticate it with a one-time password. The official said applicants will have to provide passport and visa details and permits will then be issued. For renewals, the same mobile number will have to be used for authentication. A senior officer said the department plans to set the fees for renewal or issue of international permit at about Rs 2,500. Officials said the RTO department will have the responsibility of sending the permit to wherever the applicant is overseas. Officials said the RTO concerned will have to make a decision on issuing the permit within 24 hours of the application. The officer said that in no case will the applicant be called to the RTO for any clarification. International driving permits are issued to applicants who hold a permanent licence. The applicant will also have to specify the countries to be visited and the duration of their stay among other details necessary for the issuance of the document.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/soon-faceless-procedure-for-international-driving-permits/articleshow/87654356.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

A video is being circulated of their former finance minister (Sudhir Mungantiwar) who had categorically denied their inclusion that time. Indeed, their salaries are on lower side and need to be hiked. However, the state was undergoing through precarious financial position since last two years due to Covid pandemic and it is not possible to accommodate 1.10 lakh staffers now.”Blaming the BJP for holding common citizens to ransom, Wadettiwar said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, despite suffering from health problems, had discussed this crucial issue during the cabinet meeting and requested the protestors to call off their strike. “The opposition is destroying the ST employees for their political gains in times of pandemic. The government however wants an amicable either through the Bombay High Court or direct talks.”On Naxalite letter to him, the minister said he had already forwarded it to the Home Department. “I have not gone at the tribals protests at Etapalli, as I was requested by the Gadchiroli SP and other officers to remain at home citing security concerns,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-instigating-st-staff-holding-public-to-ransom-wadettiwar/articleshow/87654331.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The tigress, whose body was discovered on Thursday morning, has been identified as part of the litter of popular tigress Madhu of Tadoba buffer zone.Forest officials suspect a farm labourer laid electrified wire along the farm fence to deter wild animals from entering, to protect his crop. Official sources informed that the carcass was discovered in the morning, around 25 meters away from the road on the farm owned by one Randive. RFO, Bhadrawati, Haridas Shende rushed to the spot with his team on getting information and removed the body after necessary inquest formality.Shende confirmed that the tigress had died of electrocution, but they did not recover any wire laid for electrocution. Foresters have detained the farm labourer, who is suspected to have laid the electrified wire. The farm owner lives somewhere else, in a town.Post mortem on the carcass was carried out at Chora forest depot by a team of veterinary doctors comprising Dr Kundam Podchelwar, Dr Ravikant Khobragade and livestock development officer Dr Shendre. “There was a deep scorch mark of electrocution on right hind leg of the animal. The feline is likely to have come through the nullah flowing nearby and fell prey to electrified wire laid through the field,” said the officials, confirming death due to electrocution.State wildlife board member Bandu Dhotre, who was present at the scene, claimed that sub-adult tigers are dispersing from Tadoba through the fields on the fringes of Bhadrawati and Warora range due to their rising population. Recent incidents of tiger falling into farm well in Warora range, attack on farmers on farms in the same range, and this instance of tigress death on a farm strongly suggest that tigers are using surrounding fields to move out.“Farmers try to protect their standing crops by electrifying their farm fences to deter intruding wild herbivores. Hence it is necessary to educate farmers and provide them solar fencing, which is non-lethal,” Dhotre empathized. He underlined the need for immediate implementation of schemes meant for installing solar fences to farmers for protection of their crops as well as wildlife.Sources informed that this is the fifth death of tiger in Chandrapur this year. Maharashtra has witnessed 34 tiger deaths so far and this is the first death due to electrocution this year, sources claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tigress-dies-of-electrocution-in-farm-at-bhadrawati-fifth-death-in-chandrapur-this-year/articleshow/87654326.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Navi-mumbai||Now, Mumbai just 15,000 jabs short of 100% single shot coverage||MUMBAI: The city is a mere 15,000 shots shy of vaccinating its entire population with at least one dose. Civic officials are hopeful of hitting the 100% first shot milestone by Friday. Mumbai has an adult population of 92,36,546 as per estimates from the state government. Till Thursday evening, 92,21,136 (99.8%) had been vaccinated with one dose while 59,14,579 (64%) had taken both shots. In all, 1,51,35,715 doses have been administered in the city since January 16 when the national vaccination drive was kick started. Among corporations, Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation with a population of 11 lakh was the first in the region to achieve 100% with a single shot. Outside of Maharashtra, Bhubaneswar claimed to be the first city to reach the milestone. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said it would be an important milestone in Mumbai’s fight against coronavirus. “We are leading in vaccination across India. Though Mumbai accounts for 10% of the state's population, nearly 15% of doses administered in the state have been in Mumbai,” he said, adding that credit for the feat goes to immunization teams, nurses, hospital heads and all agencies who have participated in the drive over the past 10 months. “We will continue to motivate people at all local levels to get vaccinated since there could be individuals still hesitant to take the vaccine.” The city had started with 10 public vaccination centres. Over the months, the number of centres increased to 461, including 145 private facilities. Nearly 40% of vaccination in Mumbai has been carried out in the private centres. Kakani said vaccination centres may not be scaled down significantly as more than 35lakh people are yet to take their second doses. Also, the vaccination for adolescents is likely to be rolled out from December for which the existing centres may be useful.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-now-city-just-15000-jabs-short-of-100-single-shot-coverage/articleshow/87656683.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Now, Mumbai just 15,000 jabs short of 100% single shot coverage||MUMBAI: The city is a mere 15,000 shots shy of vaccinating its entire population with at least one dose. Civic officials are hopeful of hitting the 100% first shot milestone by Friday. Mumbai has an adult population of 92,36,546 as per estimates from the state government. Till Thursday evening, 92,21,136 (99.8%) had been vaccinated with one dose while 59,14,579 (64%) had taken both shots. In all, 1,51,35,715 doses have been administered in the city since January 16 when the national vaccination drive was kick started. Among corporations, Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation with a population of 11 lakh was the first in the region to achieve 100% with a single shot. Outside of Maharashtra, Bhubaneswar claimed to be the first city to reach the milestone. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said it would be an important milestone in Mumbai’s fight against coronavirus. “We are leading in vaccination across India. Though Mumbai accounts for 10% of the state's population, nearly 15% of doses administered in the state have been in Mumbai,” he said, adding that credit for the feat goes to immunization teams, nurses, hospital heads and all agencies who have participated in the drive over the past 10 months. “We will continue to motivate people at all local levels to get vaccinated since there could be individuals still hesitant to take the vaccine.” The city had started with 10 public vaccination centres.

---||Delhi||Premium liquor brands in short supply, Delhiites look elsewhere||NEW DELHI: A shortage of liquor is being reported from different parts of the national capital with less than a week to go for a significant transition in the excise regime in the city. With private liquor vends closed and government vends set to remain open until November 16, Delhiites are forced to visit neighbouring Gurgaon and Noida to buy premium and even sought-after cheaper brands. Even though demand peaks during the festive season, the supply of brands in demand has gone down. As part of Delhi government’s new excise policy, which aims to reform excise rules to increase revenue and provide consumers a much better user experience while buying liquor, the city has been divided into 32 zones and licenses have been allotted on a zonal basis. The transition from the old system to the new saw the private vends closed down from October 1 and only the government vends will remain open till November 17. Sources said that at present, the available stock is being cleared and the vends have not been restocked, leading to the shortage. “There is a shortage of not only premium brands but any brand that sells,” said Vinod Giri, director general of the Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies. “The number of shops is anyway reduced, and the government shops don’t have clarity about what would happen to the stock that remains with them when they shut down,” he said. Giri said that due to the uncertainty over leftover stock, shops had placed conservative orders less than the usual demand. “This is the peak demand time because of the season and they are out of any stock now,” he said, claiming that the scheduling by the excise department has not been appropriately planned with orders taken only till November 3. Giri said that even from November 17, when the new licensees take over, the supply situation may not improve immediately. “In many cases, prices have not been fixed and the supply chain will not kick in immediately. The shortage will not remain only till November 16 but might extend a little. The switch over has not been as smooth as envisaged,” he said. “We are committed to starting the new system from November 17 and we are working at a war footing so that things are much better from next week,” said a Delhi government official. “In any transition, there are some teething troubles, but in the long run, it would be an entirely different kind of consumer experience for Delhiites,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/premium-liquor-brands-in-short-supply-delhiites-look-elsewhere/articleshow/87655577.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Jaipur||Health officials from Centre inspect Rajasthan to contain dengue||JAIPUR: Health officials from the Centre have visited Ajmer, Jodhpur and Jaipur to provide technical support to the local health authorities in containing the spread of dengue. The number of Dengue deaths in the state has touched 33, while the overall tally of dengue cases rose to 13,412 on Wednesday. A senior health department official said the Centre’s team inspected three districts of the state and visited local areas which are at high risk. "In Jaipur, they visited Shastri Nagar and Bani Park areas, where they inspected the houses and suggested that people should keep surroundings clean and keep changing water in containers every seven days. They suggested that breeding of mosquitoes should be prevented in houses," said Dr Narrottam Sharma, chief medical health officer (Jaipur-I). In Jaipur, the health department has set up a control room for dengue (0141-2605858), while for fogging, the Jaipur Municipal Corporation is the responsible government agency. The health department has been appealing to people to conduct anti-larval activities in their houses by cleaning water collected in jars, vases and other containers, where mosquitoes breed since the dengue cases started emerging post-monsoon. The Centre’s teams were tasked to assist and support states to mount an effective public health response. The teams have prepared a report on the status of vector control, availability of kits and medicines, early detection, availability and use of insecticides, the status of anti-larval and anti-adult vector control measures in the state. Since Rajasthan witnessed an increased number of cases reported in October as compared to the number of cases during the same period the previous year, it was among the states where the Centre had sent its teams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/health-officials-from-centre-inspect-state-to-contain-dengue/articleshow/87655039.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat govt clears major hurdles for redevelopment||AHMEDABAD: A major hurdle in the path of redevelopment of old societies registered under the Gujarat Co-operative Act has been removed. A simple office order to all district registrars of co-operatives has been issued by the state to allow redevelopment projects under the amended Act. Though the existing amendment to the Gujarat Ownership Flats Act (1972) was made in September 2018, it was in December 2019 that the urban development department clearly stated that the redevelopment clause also applies to housing societies governed by Gujarat Cooperatives Act. However, since there was no office order from the Co-operatives department, many district registrars were reluctant to accept redevelopment proposals from cooperative housing societies. Meanwhile, major issues are arising out of situations where 25% residents do not agree to redevelopment. Surendra Shah of Vaikunth society in Maninagar says, “In the existing GOF Act, stateneeds to make clear the legal procedures to be followed in cases 25% members of a society do not consent to redevelopment.” Similar issue is being faced by residents of Shri Vivekanand Society in Jodhpur where the developer for past two years is paying transit rent for all 76 members but the project is yet to take off as two members have disagreed. A major potential also lies in many societies constructed by the Gujarat Housing Board. Recently, the state cleared a proposal to convert housing units of the Gujarat Housing Board from leasehold to freehold on payment of a fixed jantri amount. Apart from generating income for the state government, the move will pave the way for residents to own such properties, which they currently hold on lease. Not only will the residents get higher income from sale of these properties, they can also opt for redevelopment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/state-clears-major-hurdles-for-redevelopment/articleshow/87654353.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BJP’s caste cauldron with missing recipe||LUCKNOW: On an upward swing since 2014 Lok Sabha elections and aiming to grab 51% vote share in upcoming polls and of course with a claim of being the largest party nationally, there are grey areas in the BJP that have continued to haunt it since the popularity surge. With assembly elections a few months from now in Uttar Pradesh, the concern is only growing with a few add-on lists. While the caste cauldron of the BJP has several prominent categories out of its recipe mostly because of unavailability, the BJP thinktanks’ dilemma to win over the leftover has still not yielded desired results. Adding to their worries is the fact that a few castes have moved one step towards disenchantment with the party. The main worry haunting the party is its inability to win over the leftover castes, a BJP strategist claimed. Major castes still not in the BJP’s caste bouquet in UP are causing more concern than anything else, he added. Among the major OBCs, the major caste that has remained elusive for the BJP has been Kurmis. Reasons are plenty, a BJP leader said, adding that Kurmis for over two decades had been more loyal to Apna Dal founded by late Sonelal Patel than any other party. It has been so as its founder had made concerted efforts to woo Kurmis who has a sizeable population in UP’s eastern region and some constituencies in Kanpur region. Though there has been no caste-based census, parties claim that Kurmis have seven to eight per cent presence among the OBCs, the most after Yadavs who are believed to have over nine per cent presence among the OBCs. The inability of the BJP to woo Kurmis into the party fold despite the presence of Kurmi leaders like UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and others has forced the party to forge an alliance with Apna Dal-led by late Sonelal Patel’s daughter Anupriya Patel. Barring the numbers, the alliance has favoured Apna Dal more than the BJP itself as even after over six years in power at the Centre and over four-and-a-half-year in power in the state, the Kurmis still have remained elusive for the BJP by and large. Now, the BJP is once again relying on Anupriya Patel’s Apna Dal to win over seats in Vidhan Sabha elections rather than the Kurmis. The BJP had won 312 out of 403 (77.4%) seats in UP assembly polls, increasing its vote share by 25% from the 2012 assembly elections to 39.7% in 2017. The BJP garnered 37.4% of the votes in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The NDA as a whole, received nearly 45% of the vote. Kurmis are not the only worry for the BJP. The list also has Nishads, Rajbhars and Jatavs among Dalits. Even the Rajbhars have remained more loyal to former cabinet minister Om Prakash Rajbhar-led Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party than the BJP despite the BJP leaders, including Amit Shah and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, making major announcements for the community, including the installation of the statue of Hindu warrior Suheldev Rajbhar. Elusive Rajbhars have forced the BJP to forge an alliance with Om Prakash Rajbharled SBSP in 2017 Assembly elections. SBSP got eight seats from BJP’s quota and won four seats and SBSP’s chief Om Prakash Rajbhar getting a cabinet rank in the Yogi Government. However, the honeymoon for the BJP with the SBSP was short-lived as Om Prakash Rajbhar snapped ties. Om Prakash Rajbhar has now announced SBSP’s alliance with the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party. A senior BJP leader was tightlipped when asked if efforts to woo back Rajbhar into BJP as alliance partner had stopped. The SBSP joining hands with SP has made things a little difficult for the BJP especially in the eastern UP, an expert said and added that the alliance would benefit the SP at the cost of the BJP with Akhilesh looking to reap benefits from Yadav-Muslim-Rajbhar combination. The BJP did try to create a leadership of its own by elevating Anil Rajbhar to Cabinet rank, but he has not been able to replace Om Prakash Rajbhar’s clout among the community. Like Rajbhars, Nishad, too, have shown their loyalty towards Dr Sanjay Nishadled NISHAD Party. This has led to the BJP forging an alliance with Dr Sanjay Nishad, but not before giving a Lok Sabha ticket to Dr Sanjay Nishad’s son Pravin Nishad and nominating Dr Sanjay as MLC a month back. Last but not the least, Jatavs among the Dalits have remained loyal to Mayawati-led BSP. Even though the BJP has managed to woo other Dalit castes into its fold in the past three elections, Jatavs continue to show faith in Mayawati. Will they remain loyal in the 2022 polls? Only time will tell.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjps-caste-cauldron-with-missing-recipe/articleshow/87655579.cms||Rajiv Srivastava
---||Jaipur||Disability commissioner’s office raises concern over issues related to PwDs||Jaipur: The office of the commissioner for persons with disability (PwD) has written three letters to the directorate of specially abled persons raising concerns with regard to online issuance of disability certificates, extending government benefits to differently abled pensioners as per BPL norms, and making changes in the guidelines for the scooty scheme. The letters were sent as no action had been taken on these issues by the directorate. The directorate hasn’t replied to any of these letters issued by the commissioner’s office as of now, it added. Petitions in this regard were filed by national vice-president of Divyang Adhikar Mahasangh Hemant Bhai Goyal. The office of the commissioner has directed the directorate of specially-abled persons to take appropriate action in this regard and inform them about it. The petition stated that specially-abled persons were facing a lot of problems in applying for disability certificates online. The office of the commissioner for specially abled persons had issued notices to the directorate of specially abled persons earlier too directing it to make changes in the guidelines for distributing scooty to persons belonging to the category by accommodating other PwD (persons with disability) categories under the scheme. The Divyang Adhikar Mahasangh had raised an objection with the commissioner for specially abled persons with regard to making only persons with locomotor disability eligible for the scheme and leaving out persons with disability (PwD) of other categories. It had also raised an objection with regard to giving benefit under the scheme to employed persons only up to 29 years of age. “There are 21 categories of PwDs (persons with disability) in the state. However, in the guidelines issued by the directorate, they have made only persons with locomotor disability eligible for the scheme. Others like acid attack survivors, persons with autism spectrum disorder, speech and language disability, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, dwarfs, those having hearing loss and others should also be made beneficiaries under the scheme,” said Goyal. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot had announced in the budget for the financial year 2021-22 that college-going students and employed youths under PwD (persons with disability) category will be provided scooty under the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/disability-commissioners-office-raises-concern-over-issues-related-to-pwds/articleshow/87655050.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||MPCB inspection nails pollution at Vimla railway siding||Chandrapur: The inspection by the sub-regional officer of Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) at Vimla Infrastructure (India) Pvt Ltd railway siding at Tadali MIDC here on Thursday revealed several violations of pollution norms.The officer found many facts corroborating the allegation about high pollution caused by the railway siding in the complaint filed by NGO Sanjeewani Paryawarn Samajik Sanstha. The discovery of multiple heaps of suspicious ‘churned coal-like mineral’ at siding has also validated claims of the complainant about mixing of unwanted material into the coal transported from the place.The inspection report states that there are three railway tracks and five platforms of the railway siding, used mainly for transport of coal and iron ore. Currently, four platforms (no. 2, 3, 4 and 5) are in use and a total of 16,000 Metric Tonnes of coal is stocked there. The coal stock comes mostly from WCL (through railway), while outward material is brought by Chaddha Transport, and Sapra Transport. One or two railway rakes of coal are loaded and transported from the siding daily.Inspection reports state that most of the heaps of coal are laid in open and there is no arrangement for dust suppression. The rain guns installed on platform no. 3 and 4 were non-operational. Inspection also revealed that there is a thick layer of dust on approach roads and most of the trucks found there were without tarpaulin to cover the material being transported. Approach roads are dotted with potholes and all the interior roads on siding are kuccha roads, without any fixed water sprinklers along them.The inspection officer collected samples from suspicious stacks of coal like churned material alongside the coal stock on all four platforms used by Maharashtra State Mining Corporation, Nilkanth Transport, Maruti Tradelink, and Rukmai Trading. Inspection also revealed the presence of two suspicious coal stocks in open land near the siding, which railway siding representative claimed does not belong to them. Samples from these stocks have also been collected. The officer found a thick layer of dust on trees, plants and cotton crops in adjoining farmlands. The inspection report highlights heavy fugitive dust emission due to loading and unloading at siding and transportation by trucks. There is no compound wall and no tyre washing system at the siding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mpcb-inspection-nails-pollution-at-vimla-railway-siding/articleshow/87654344.cms||Mazhar Ali

The rally was organised to welcome Yashpal Arya and his son Sanjeev Arya, who recently rejoined Congress after leaving BJP. Addressing the rally, Rawat said, “Despite a clear mandate, the BJP did not fulfill the commitments it made to the people but we will fulfill all our manifesto promises.” The rally was scheduled to be held on Wednesday but owing to a chief minister programme at a nearby location, the event was delayed by a day. The former CM added, “The BJP government has failed on all fronts. Migration from the hills remains a major problem and unemployment has forced youths to move out of state. In addition, anti-people decisions like Char Dham Devasthanam Board and amendment to land purchase laws were made. If voted to office, we will work for the people and take decisions in their interests.” Meanwhile, Rawat's Surendra Kumar slammed the BJP over corruption. “People are still waiting for the appointment of a Lokayukta. The BJP government has tabled the bill in the state assembly but the issue has been on the backburner for over four years. Corruption is at its peak and to avoid any punitive action, the post of ombudsman has been kept vacant,” Kumar said at a press conference.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/will-deliver-on-manifesto-promises-harish-rawat-in-shankhnaad-rally-at-haldwani/articleshow/87654335.cms||Kautilya Singh

They also raised questions why a minister in power needs to engage in an agitation to stop mining.Wadettiwar, speaking to media, said he had to abandon the plan to join the agitation after being requested by the collector and the SP. “I have forwarded the letter issued by the Maoists in my name to the home department,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-shinde-maoists-take-potshots-at-wadettiwar/articleshow/87654342.cms||Soumitra Bose

The SC said the HC, both, a division bench and single-judge bench, cannot be faulted in setting aside the sole arbitrator’s decision. A bench of Justices SK Kaul and MM Sundresh on November 10 dismissed with costs, an appeal filed by Ratnam Iyer—Shroff’s former business associate-- against the HC division bench decision which had also dismissed his appeal against an order of a single Judge bench. Iyer is a resident of Singapore. The SC bench said, “Business associations can sour and that is what has happened in the present case. That the association was across the seas is another aspect.’’ “We find that the arbitrator’s conclusions are not in accordance with the fundamental policy of Indian law, and can thus be set aside…’’ said the SC. The arbitrator had relied on a clause in an agreement between Iyer and Shroff, the consequences of which “are so inappropriate’’ that the award would not stand, the apex court held. – Swati Deshpande||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-5m-arbitral-award-apex-court-relief-for-jackie-shroff/articleshow/87655959.cms||---

His relatives were informed of the letter and a search operation was also conducted to find Agri but he couldn’t be traced then. Police have said that the body must have come on the surface of the lake on its own after three days. According to the victim’s family, Agri was unemployed and battling mental health issues for months.

---||Nagpur||Gold rates bounce back after Diwali, Dhanteras slump||Nagpur: After a slump during Diwali and also a fall of over Rs450 a tola soon after Dhanteras, gold rates have bounced back on inflation concerns.At Rs49,700 a tola, gold rates are Rs1,500 higher than that in Dhanteras which was on November 2. Silver is also up by Rs2,000 at Rs67,500 a kg in the Nagpur market.The fall was due to apprehensions of a rate hike likely to be announced by the US Fed Reserve. However, the rates were intact. Rising inflation has shifted hedge funds investment to the yellow metal, making gold costly. In India, a weaker rupee has added to the rally. Gold is a dollar-denominated asset. So, if the greenback gets costlier as against the rupee, it makes gold costlier.Ashish Pethe, chairman of Gem and Jewellery Domestic Council, said the rally has affected the demand moderately. “The levels of physical sale are expected to rise against after the rates are stabilized,” he added. Pethe said the rates have gone up due inflation as gold has been a hedge against it.Nitin Khandelwal, former chairman of the council, said last month as much as 90 tons of gold was imported. This was enough to meet the demand. “However, if buying continues as consumers may hope to take advantage of the rally, the yearly imports may touch 1000 tons,” he said.Rakesh Rokde from the Nagpur Sarafa Association said even the Indian demand is expected to have a role in the gold rally. The rally once again led to a hike after Dhanteras.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gold-rates-bounce-back-after-diwali-dhanteras-slump/articleshow/87654364.cms||Shishir Arya

The parikrama, which is organised just after Deepawali, is 45km trek undertaken by pilgrims around the periphery of the twin towns. According to Ayodhya administration, more than 10lakh devotees are expected to take part in the gathering, which will start on Friday and conclude late Saturday. The borders of Faizabad and Ayodhya towns were sealed late Thursday and vehicular entry into the twin towns through highways were banned. If the crowd swells, vehicles coming from Lucknow, Gorakhpur, Azamgarh, Rae Bareli, Sultanpur and Gonda will be diverted at least 100km before the district borders, said a top police officer. The centuries-old ‘Chaudah Kosi Parikrama' ushers the beginning of ‘Kartik Purnima Mela' in Ayodhya and this will be followed by ‘Panch Kosi Parikrama' in which devotees will do a 15km round-trek of the town’s periphery. Talking to TOI, inspector general of police, Ayodhya range, KP Singh, said, “Around 30lakh devotees could participate in both 'parikramas' and the numbers could increase with many devotees arriving to witness construction of the Ram temple. “The district administration has made elaborate arrangements to control traffic and barricades have been erected at over 36 intersections on the 'parikrama' route,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/10l-pilgrims-expected-at-14-kosi-parikrama-in-ayodhya-post-covid/articleshow/87655594.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

The country’s name has not been disclosed considering the security reasons.The factory had been supplying the shells to Indian Army. However, as the requirement now reduced to less than half of the factory’s capacity, YIL now, as an independent PSU, needs to explore other in business opportunities for sustaining itself.YIL, or the old Ambajhari factory, makes products like empty shells of rockets and shells for the artillery and armoured weapon systems. “There are plans to export the shells of this caliber to different middle eastern as well other countries,” said sources. The empty shells were filled with ammunition at the erstwhile ordnance factory Chanda. The factory now comes under a different PSU,-- Munitions India Limited (MIL). The filling will now be done as a commercial transaction by MIL.YIL is also exploring options to sell empty shell in foreign markets too.“YIL will have to explore other markets as its existing order book from the Army is not very healthy,” said sources. “This is because the requirement keeps varying leading to major dips in orders from time to time. At present, the company’s expenses exceed the income from orders for the current year,” sources added.YIL has been formed by clubbing seven ordnance factories and is headquartered at Nagpur.The factory however also needs support from the government so that it can sustain in the long run. If the losses are mount than as a PSU it may be difficult to sustain due. This can lead to the state of art machinery assets under the company going waste, said sources.The import orders would take finalize in the longer term of 2-3 years till then the new company needs to be supported.The YIL is also exploring the scope of manufacturing railway axles as the existing set up also can be used for the purpose. This is part of the mandate after corporatization.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/yil-eyes-deal-to-help-middle-east-country-set-up-howitzer-shell-factory/articleshow/87654349.cms||Shishir Arya

A civic official said the IVR services of BSNL may be used to reach out to them. The civic body has already downloaded names and handed them over to ward war rooms. The sheer numbers could mean the teams would take a while to reach everyone. "Through IVR, people will get calls and they simply have to press 1 or 2 if they have been vaccinated with the first or both doses. The automated system can reach 4-5lakh in a matter of a few days. The ward war room efforts will continue too," the official said. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said there are four possible groups: those who have taken a second shot under a different number, those who took a first shot in Mumbai and the second elsewhere, numbers that are not reachable, and finally, people willing but haven’t had time to take it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ivr-system-to-reach-out-to-4-73-lakh-due-for-a-2nd-shot/articleshow/87655590.cms||---

On Thursday, she met a delegation of ASHA workers who were allegedly beaten up by the Shahjahanpur police when they tried to meet UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday. Thereafter she accused the BJP government of disrespecting the ASHA workers. Political analysts saw the move as another bid to consolidate and woo women voters in UP. Priyanka also promised to pay Rs 10,000 as honorarium to them if voted to power. As of now, ASHA workers are paid a small incentive per activity. The incentives add up to about Rs 3,500-Rs 3,700 at the end of each month. ASHA workers have been demanding revision of their incentive and permanency of jobs for long. In all, there are over two lakh ASHA workers in UP. After meeting the delegation, Priyanka accused the UP government of ‘insulting’ the work done by Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA). "Every assault on the ASHA sisters by the UP government is an insult to the work done by them. My ASHA sisters have given their services diligently in coronavirus pandemic times and on other occasions. A decent Honorarium is their right. It is the duty of the government to listen to them,” she said in a tweet after her meeting. Adding that ASHAs deserved respect and the Congress will fight for them, Priyanka said: “The Congress party is committed to the rights of honorarium of Asha sisters and their respect and if the government is formed, Asha sisters and Anganwadi workers will be given an honorarium of Rs 10,000 per month.” Earlier, Priyanka lent her voice to the contractual staff posted in UP secretariat allegedly harassed by a senior officer on her workplace. Though an FIR under relevant sections of law was lodged against the officer accused by the UP police, Priyanka took to social media to question the safety of women at work place or anywhere else.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/priyanka-promises-rs-10k-honorarium-to-asha-workers/articleshow/87655606.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Mangaluru||Covid aftermath: No fees, poor admissions push 14 schools in DK to shut down||Mangaluru: The Covid-induced financial crunch and the near lack of school admissions have forced 14 schools in Dakshina Kannada to shut their operations. Of the 14, one is a government school, four are aided schools and nine are unaided or private institutions. All have written to the department of public instruction (DPI), seeking to shut their doors. The only government school shutting down is doing so for lack of fresh admission. The school is in Kilenjur, under the Mangaluru North Block Education Office (BEO) limits. The lower primary school had two children, who were siblings. They completed their studies and there are no new admissions this academic year. In the same BEO limits, two aided schools and an unaided one have sent proposals for closure. In the Mangaluru South BEO limits, two unaided schools and an aided one are expected to close their doors too. In the Moodbidri BEO limits, one aided and one unaided school, and in the Bantwal BEO limits, two unaided schools have sought closure. There are two unaided schools closed in the Puttur BEO limits and one unaided in the Sullia limits, said Manjula KL, the deputy project coordinator of the Samagra Shiksha Karnataka, Dakshina Kannada. The major reason for the closure of the unaided schools is the non-payment of fees. This has resulted in a financial crisis for them. Poor admissions and management of the institutions are also factors that led the schools to decide to shut down. “We cater to children from low-income groups. As a result of the pandemic, their parents have not paid us the proper fees. We cannot pay our staff and look after the buildings’ maintenance. We cannot sustain ourselves any longer after the economic blow and decided to shut down. The institution may open next year,” said an institution head. A DPI official said: “The head of a private school in Moodbidri has gone incommunicado and all staff have been laid off. Meanwhile, all the students have been given transfer certificates without citing any reason for the school’s closure. We have asked them to clarify,” said the official. DDPI Malleswamy shared that the closure of some schools is temporary. “They may open in the next academic year,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/covid-aftermath-no-fees-poor-admissions-push-14-schools-in-dk-to-shut-down/articleshow/87653579.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

Sand mining from river beds has been allowed after almost four years and lease holders are expected to start operations over the next three months after getting environmental clearance (EC) from the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC). Additional chief secretary, mines and petroleum, Subodh Agarwal said, “With our chief minister's efforts, the long-pending issue of illegal bajri mining has been resolved in the state. This will benefit the public at large. At present, there are three large leases operational and five more are expected to start operations soon. More companies will start work as soon they receive EC.” The CEC, constituted by the apex court to look into the issue of illegal sand mining on December 23, 2020, had submitted its report after carrying out a physical inspection. “The recommendations made by the CEC, except recommendation ‘J’, are approved for implementation forthwith,” the court order says. An official with the mining department said the ‘J’ recommendation referred to levying a penalty of Rs 10 lakh per vehicle and Rs 5 lakh per cubic metre of sand seized. The CEC has recommended the MoEFCC to issue EC to all valid letter of intent (LoI) holders recommended by the expert appraisal committee (EAC) within a period of three months and without insisting on the submission of the scientific replenishment report as a pre-condition. The replenishment study will be undertaken during the course of mining. “Out of 82 large leases, the EAC has recommended 65. After the SC nod, they will receive EC within 3 months from the MoEFCC,” an official mining department source said. The SC had earlier restrained operations of large mining lease holders who did not have EC from the ministry. The ministry had later laid a condition for companies to carry out a scientific replenishment study. In its report, the CEC highlighted the delay in granting EC as the main reason for the widening gap between supply and demand, which resulted in the proliferation of illegal mining activities. Following the order, the state government is likely to earn an estimated revenue of Rs 400 crore per annum. A senior mining department official said, “The 65 large leases can mine an estimated 700 lakh tonne from their operations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/after-4-yrs-sc-nod-for-sandmining-from-river-beds-in-raj/articleshow/87655106.cms||Ajay Singh

At least 83% of people have been administered the first dose and 48.9% people have been administered bot the doses in the state. He said efforts would be made for the 100% vaccination by making a special action plan and increasing the number of vaccination camps in the less vaccinated districts. The health department is focusing on vaccination at the ongoing Prashashan Sheharon and Gaon ke Sang campaigns. People who were deprived of the Covid vaccine would be vaccinated on a largescale through 12,000 camps in Chiranjeevi Health Camps starting from November 14. Till November 10, against the targeted population of the state, more than 6.36 lakh people have been administered the first dose and more than 2.8 crore have been administered both the doses.

We are 800 of us here and our lives are under threat. There is only one security guard here,” said Sagar Dole who heads the MBBS students association in Yavatmal.“Ashok was a sincere, calm and studious person. He was brutally murdered in cold blood. The spot where the incident took place is among the dark areas of the campus. There is no CCTV too,” added Dole.Doctors believe it was a preplanned murder. They told TOI that Pal had some issues with relatives of a patient in August. “If proper security was provided inside the campus, he would have been alive today,” said Dr Saket Mundhada, vice-president of the Central Committee of the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) who also heads MARD at GMCH Yavatmal.MARD has taken up the matter with medical education minister Amit Deshmukh and the DMER chief Dr Dilip Mhaisekar. “Doctors face attacks by angry relatives every day. We demand immediate justice for Ashok and a safe and secure environment in all medical colleges,” said Dr Dnyaneshwar Dhobale, president of Central MARD.The MBBS students and resident doctors locked all gates of the campus and raised slogans. They stopped working for almost entire Thursday. A candle march was taken out on Thursday evening. In-charge dean Dr MB Kamble offered to resign but it has not been accepted by the DMER yet.That Deshmukh had not reacted till late on Thursday has disheartened the doctors. “Justice delayed is justice denied,” said one of the agitating doctors while speaking to TOI. The GMCs across the state are likely to intensify the agitation on Friday.Sena neta threatens agitating doctorsLate on Thursday, the central committee of MARD released video footage of Yavatmal’s Shiv Sena neta Santosh Dhawale threatening them. He can be heard saying, “Will you leave the place or shall I call my men.”“How can a student feel secure in a college campus when a politician threatens us in front of the collector and superintendent of police?” the tweet addressed to CM Uddhav Thackeray, deputy CM Ajit Pawar and home minister Dilip Walse Patil reads. Dhawale had contested the MLA elections twice and lost. He became popular by helping poor patients at the GMCH.

Sumit Matoo posted a picture on social media of his grandmother, Jagat Rani Koul, on the trolley on Wednesday. Tagging the airline, IndiGo, Matoo wrote that his grandmother had to wait for over an hour before being taken inside on the trolley, and that the airline said it had only three wheelchairs for passengers flying out. Speaking to TOI on Thursday, Matoo said his relatives were travelling from Pune to Delhi and then to Jammu. “What happened was embarrassing and insulting. We had booked the tickets two months in advance and opted for wheelchair assistance for my grandmother as she is old and cannot walk,” he said. The flight was set to take off at 1.20pm and Matoo’s family reached the airport around 11am. “At the IndiGo counter, my relatives asked for a wheelchair and were told to wait for 15 minutes. This stretched for nearly an hour,” he said. With about an hour to go, the family found that no one at the IndiGo counter could give any satisfactory answers regarding the wheelchair. “An airline staffer said that if my grandmother could walk, she should. Ultimately, my relatives had no option but to get her to sit over some luggage on the baggage trolley and wheeled her till the departure gate. There, a CISF officer arranged for a wheelchair,” he said. Gueries were sent via messages to IndiGo on Wednesday evening and Thursday, but there was no response at the time of filing this report. An airline representative, however, replied to Matoo on social media. “We understand one of our managers was in touch and able to resolve the matter. We are extremely sensitive towards the needs of our passengers in need of special assistance. This has been highlighted to all teams to ensure non-occurrence,” the message stated. Pune airport director Santosh Dhoke said providing wheelchairs was the responsibility of airlines. “I don’t have information about the incident. We have a helpdesk which can be contacted too. They could have also contacted the terminal manager,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/booked-wheelchair-missing-85-yr-old-flyer-brought-into-pune-airport-on-baggage-trolley/articleshow/87655076.cms||Joy Sengupta

He assured that workers wanting to resume will be provided security by the government. On the other hand, many commuters who depended on the alternate private transport complained of ‘shortage of vehicles’ and ‘overcharging’ across the state.As many as 1,135 more workers were suspended in MSRTC on Thursday, including 64 from Mumbai depots and 73 from Thane, for joining the strike. With this, the total number of staffers suspended so far has risen to 2,053. Speaking to the media, Parab said that the workers were being hindered by “political parties, including the BJP”. While BJP had supported the workers in morchas, sit-in protests and rallies on Wednesday, a delegation of ST workers got support from MNS leader Raj Thackeray, who heard their grievances at his residence in Dadar on Thursday morning. “The issues facing workers are never resolved through political agitations,” Parab said. He warned that those who obstruct employees from returning to work will be dealt with sternly. The strike inconvenienced lakhs of commuters across Maharashtra, many of whom had to pay more for the private transport. They complained of overcharging by few private buses and other vehicles across the state. More than 2,000 private buses operated across the state, besides several private cabs, autos and other vehicles. Shivneri AC buses which are popular on Mumbai-Pune route and charge Rs 525 per seat were off roads. In comparison, some of the private bus operators charged Rs 800 upwards for a trip to Pune. In Satara, private buses were running full and many passengers were stranded on Thursday night. “Even milk vans were in demand as they picked up passengers,” said a Mumbai resident who wanted to travel from Satara. In a few districts, passengers told the media that private bus fares were almost double the normal MSRTC fare. As per rules, the government can take action against operators as they are allowed to hike fares only 1.5 times the MSRTC fare, officials added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-govt-promises-to-protect-msrtc-staffers-willing-to-return-another-1135-suspended/articleshow/87655971.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

Sources said that the UT administration requested the President’s office for inauguration of the Chandigarh Bird Park, but has not received confirmation till date. They added that if the bird park inauguration did not figure in the President’s schedule, they would could get it inaugurated by UT administrator Banwari Lal Purohit. Recently, the Central Zoo Authority (CZA), in an RTI reply, clarified that the bird aviary does not fall under the definition of a zoo as per Section 2 (39) of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The ministry of environment, forest and climate change recently gave clearance for the walk-through bird aviary. According to the RTI reply, a CZA team visited the site on August 27 and submitted their recommendations. The recommendations by CZA team read, “Based on the species list provided and data recorded during inspection, all species except Mandarin Duck, are non-native and do not come under the definition of captive animals as per section 2 (5) of the wildlife protection act 1972.” The recommendations further reads, “Therefore the species shall be removed from the collection, as the species is covered under schedule iv of the wildlife protection act 1972……Therefore given the proposed collection, the said facility does not come under the definition of ‘zoo’ as per section 2 (39) of the wildlife protection act, 1972”. In its reply to the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI), UT forest and wildlife department justified and defended the upcoming walk-through aviary at the city forest (Nagar Van) adjoining Sukhna Lake. “None of the rules, guidelines or laws have been violated in the process,” UT’s reply read. UT chief conservator of forests (CCF), Debendra Dalai, in the reply to AWBI said, “The department of forest and wildlife, Chandigarh administration has developed two walk through aviaries at Nagar Van within the city limits to house exotic birds which are commonly bred in India.” It adds, “The procurement of exotic birds was done only from registered, reputed and authentic sellers/breeders/suppliers and not from any grey market. These suppliers are registered with the Animal Welfare Board of Tamil Nadu (AWBT) and also registered on ‘Parivesh’ portal of ministry. Before selecting the sellers, a committee consisting of officers from different departments such as animal husbandry and fisheries, finance department and the forest department cross-verified all the details and sources of birds were also traced physically visiting the facilities on site. These exotic birds are housed for nature education and for all non-commercial usage or public displays”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-plans-to-get-chandigarh-bird-park-inaugurated-by-president/articleshow/87654383.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Jaipur||Bajri prices likely to come down after SC ruling||Edited (294) Jaipur: People of the state can heave a sigh of relief as prices of bajri are expected to come down following the Supreme Court judgment. In recent past, the ban on bajri has not only led to rise in illegal mining of the sand gravel but also increase in prices in the black market. As the sand commanded an exorbitant price in the grey market, people had no option but to buy it at higher rates. Since the ban, the rate of one truck of bajri, which stood at Rs 50,000, has now gone up to Rs 1.25 lakh. People who have started their construction work were forced to buy bajri at high prices that ranges between Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000 per tonne. People who were involved in the trade said, after the judgement, the bajri prices are expected to come down to Rs 1,000 per tonne and it will be a major relief to the residents of the state. All Rajasthan Bajri Truck Operators Welfare Society president Naveen Sharma said, “Consumers were paying exponentially high prices for bajri. Our efforts to bring the prices down to benefit the public has yielded results. This decision will curb the practice of illegal mining and black marketing. The prices will also be reduced.” Now many middle-income groups who had postponed construction of their houses in past are planning to start it again. Ramendra Singh, resident of Chitrakoot, said, “I had cancelled my plan to lay the roof of my house earlier as bajri, which is an essential part for construction was expensive and not available easily. Even buying bajri from black market was a risky affair and I don’t want to take law in my hands. Now after situation is normal will construct my house.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bajri-prices-likely-to-come-down-after-sc-ruling/articleshow/87655087.cms||---
---||Mangaluru||Tibetan duo held for credit card fraud||Mangaluru: Cybercrime sleuths in Mangaluru on Wednesday arrested two Tibetans allegedly for credit card fraud. Mangaluru city police commissioner N Shashi Kumar said that the Cyber Economics and Narcotics (CEN) Crimes wing registered a complaint from CD Alexaner, an Attavar resident, who pointed to the continued use of his State Bank of India (SBI) credit card even after he surrendered the same. In his complaint, lodged in September, Alexander stated that he surrendered his card on March 23 after the bank increased its charges. He subsequently received a one-time password (OTP) on his phone, following which details of his credit card account were collected over the phone by an individual who reportedly spoke to Alexander in Hindi. Four days after surrendering his card, Alexander learnt from statements issued by the bank that his card had been misused, with transactions worth more than Rs 1.1 lakh being billed to its account. An investigation into the crime revealed that Rs 1.12 lakh had been transferred through the MobiKwik digital wallet app to two bank accounts – one each in Maharashtra and in Uttar Pradesh. Money was also transferred to an account of Kanara DCC Bank, registered under the name Lobsang Sangyes, a resident of Lama Camp in the Tibetan Colony in Mundgod in Uttara Kannada district. Cybsercime sleuths from Mangaluru on Wednesday arrested Lobsang, 24, and Dakpa Phunde, 40, from the Shar Gaden monastery in Mundgod. Dakpa has been charged with directing Lobsang to open an account with the Kanara DCC Bank exclusively for such transactions. Dakpa has also been accused of using banned Chinese apps such as WeChat and Red Pack, which the sleuths suspect may have been used for ‘hawala’ transactions. “Local agents were facilitating the transactions between Tibet and Mundgod. Police are examining all the details, using the information retrieved from the two suspects’ phones. We think they earned a commission for the transaction. Since both of them are Tibetans, we have shared the information we have about them with other agencies,” Shashi Kumar said. The city police commissioner admitted to the two of them having been tough nuts to crack. “They refused to divulge any information, and whatever we have was retrieved using technical means, particularly bank statements. We obtained this data from their mobile phones,” Shashi Kumar added. Lobsang and Dakpa, who were produced at a court on Wednesday, were remanded in police custody for ten days, while cybercrime sleuths are on the hunt for a third individual suspected to be involved in the racket.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/tibetan-duo-held-for-credit-card-fraud/articleshow/87653597.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Haryana: Regulatory commission raps discom chief||CHANDIGARH: The chairman of Haryana discoms — Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited (DHVNL) and Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited (UHBVNL) — has virtually received rap on knuckles from the Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission (HERC) for not complying with the order regarding revision of advance consumption deposit (ACD). The commission has also given the chairman last opportunity to submit its reply on the issue within seven days or face penal action. ACD is an amount deposited to the companies by the consumers as a security to cover the consumption charges. “Had revision of ACD of individual consumers, as specified in the regulations in vogue since 2005, been carried out, every year, the issue of hardship to consumers, after the onset of Covid-19, would not have arisen at all. Hence the chairman was directed to investigate and submit his report to the commission… In view of the above, the commission reiterates its directions as issued in its order dated September 1. As a last opportunity the requisite report, be filed by the discoms’ chairman within seven days from the date of this order, failing which the commission shall be constrained to initiate action as per the Electricity Act, 2003,” the HERC, headed by its chairman R K Pachnanda has ordered. The commission also observed that it is the statutory duty of the distribution companies to comply with the commission’s directions “meticulously and in letter and spirit”. “However, the licensees have tried to circumvent the commission order by filing a report, with the approval of the additional chief secretary (ACS) for power instead of filing the investigation report of discoms chairman for not revising the ACD,” the commission observed further. In its earlier order dated September 1, the commission had directed the DHBVNL and UHBVNL chairman to investigate as to why revision of ACD of individual consumers has not been carried out since 2005. The commission had passed these orders while taking suo motu cognizance of the issue while hearing a petition for waiver of revision of ACD for the financial year 2019-20 and 2020-21 on the electricity consumers of DHBVN. UHBVN director finance submitted before the commission that there was no role of its chairman in the matter. Director operations submitted that DHBVN, vide letter dated October 13, has submitted a report duly approved by Haryana additional chief secretary (ACS) of power department in compliance of the HERC order dated September 1. On this, the commission observed that it was unfortunate to note the averment of the director finance that the chairman of the licensees had no role in the matter. “Is he trying to imply that the distribution companies’ chairman is symbolic and has abdicated his responsibility and duty? It needs to be noted that in the matter of revision of ACD, there has been a systematic failure in compliance at all levels. Resultantly, the chairman was directed and expected to investigate the matter threadbare and submit a report,” HREC observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/has-discom-chairman-abdicated-duty-asks-regulatory-commission/articleshow/87655088.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Dog carcasses exhumed from 2 spots following court order||Thiruvananthapuram: The cloud of suspicion over death of dogs brought for sterilisation at the ABC centres led to exhumations of the carcass in two different parts of the district on Wednesday. A three-member panel of government veterinary doctors exhumed as many as 10 carcasses from the premises of Animal Birth Control centre at Vandithadam to determine their cause of death. The procedure was done based on an order issued by Judicial First Class Magistrate at Neyyattinkara after admitting a petition in this regard by animal lovers and feeders Aparna Surendran, Geetha and Nisha Vincent. The carcass of a dog was exhumed and samples were sent to the disease investigation lab at Palode from Panayilkadavu in Vakkom after locals raised suspicion over the manner in which two carcasses of dogs were found near a temple pond in the area. The police and the panchayat authorities doused alleged attempts at turning it into a communal issue. Noushad B, a ward member, said that two carcasses of dogs were found near the temple pond in the past one week. “We brought the matter to the police and the carcass was exhumed to find out the actual cause of death,” said Noushad. Meanwhile, the animal lovers in the city who have raised allegations of ill treatment of stray dogs at the Animal Birth Control centre at Vandithadam filed a fresh complaint before the state police chief on Wednesday against the centre for alleged cover up of their atrocities. This was after they realised that the fresh carcass of a dog they had found buried on the centre’s premises two weeks ago has vanished. The petitioners had alleged that stray dogs brought to the ABC centre for sterilization were being ill-treated. Excess number of dogs were kept in small cages. The number of surgeries conducted per day as per the register and the number of strays kept there did not match, pointing to the possibility of strays being illegally culled to save effort. On October 28, they even found the fresh carcass of a dog buried in the centre’s compound. Though they filed a complaint before the local police at Kovalam, the police did not register an FIR. Following this, the complainants approached the court. ‘’The carcass we found belonged to a light brown coloured dog. But, what was exhumed from the same spot today was the carcass of a black dog,” said Aparna Surendran. They believe the carcass was removed to cover up the atrocity which the dog might have faced. Hence they visited the state police chief’s office in person and filed their complaint. One of the doctors in the panel told TOI that all carcasses exhumed were apparently more than three weeks old and were in varying stages of decay. After conducting a procedure to determine the species of the carcasses, samples were collected from their viscera and sent to the chemical examiner’s lab. This is to find out whether the dogs died of poisoning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/dog-carcasses-exhumed-from-2-spots-following-court-order/articleshow/87634569.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Pool cars busy elsewhere, parents fret over commute||Kolkata: Most parents now have to take on the added responsibility of ferrying their Class IX-XII wards from Tuesday when schools reopen since they are unable to get back to the earlier pool car regime because the vehicles are now otherwise engaged. In the past 20 months, when kids have been home, many pool car owners have started services for office-goers, medical staff or have converted the cars into delivery vehicles. Moreover, schools are reopening with only four classes and it is still uncertain when the junior classes will start, making it an unviable proposition to run cars for school duty, pool car owners said. They feared schools might shut again since a large number of parents are not consenting to sending kids to campuses.More than 40% pool cars are engaged in ferrying office-goers who have stopped using public transport for fear of Covid and they pay more than what pool car owners charged parents. “For most pool car owners, it was the only source of livelihood and when parents chose not to pay, we were in dire straits. We didn’t have to buy fuel and were saving on regular maintenance, but EMIs for the vehicles and drivers had to be paid. We were desperate for alternatives and when we have found them, it is difficult to re-convert, especially because ferrying school children has become an uncertain business now,” said Arupam Banerjee, vice-president of West Bengal Pool Car Owners’ Association.Pool car owners, advised by the associations, requested parents to pay at least 25% of the monthly fee and keep the service alive, but most parents did not do so saying they didn’t want to pay for a service they did not use. Pool car owners are now telling parents that even if they make arrangements for their kids, there will be a re-joining charge and a sizeable hike in the charge per child.“Despite years of service, parents pulled out when we were in a tough spot. Naturally, they will have to compensate for that,” said Gourango Sarkar, who runs a car pool service in north Kolkata and the northern fringes.Anurag Agarwal, operator of the city’s largest school bus fleet, said, “Right now, we may have to operate only 200 of my 1,000 buses.” However, bus operators will first observe the situation before taking a decision on fare modification. “When the lockdown began in March 2020, diesel price was Rs 65/L, now it is Rs 90/L. So there should be a proportionate revision,” said an operator.There are some parents who are scared of the sanitisation of pool cars. They said they will keep their wards at home at least till the vaccines come, but will finalise the pool car in the meantime. “My child catches cold very fast and I am scared of sending him to school. When I finally send him, I am not sure whether I will go back to the pool car,” said Luna Bhowmick, whose son Shreyas is in Class IX.DCP (traffic) Arijit Sinha has written to the secretaries of the West Bengal Contract Carriage Owners’ & Operators’ Association and the Pool Car Owners’ Welfare Association, urging them to check the health of the vehicles that have been idle for so long and said safety of children was of paramount importance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pool-cars-busy-elsewhere-parents-fret-over-commute/articleshow/87654397.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Schools told to arrange alternative transport for students part of NAS||Mumbai: With the on-going state transport buses strike, schools in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) have been told to arrange alternative modes of transport for students participating in a nationwide survey on learning outcomes. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) is to be held on Friday. Over 30,000 students from 950 schools in the MMR are participating in the survey. Students have to report to their respective schools by 8 am.

---||Lucknow||Annapurna idol given to Uttar Pradesh, on statewide yatra||LUCKNOW: The rare idol of Goddess Annapurna, which was retrieved by the Union government from MacKenzie Art Gallery in University of Regina, Canada, in October was formally handed over to the UP government at a function in Delhi on Thursday. The idol went missing from Varanasi more than a century ago. Union minister for culture and tourism G Kishan Reddy handed over the idol to UP minister Suresh Rana in the presence of Union ministers Smriti Irani and Meenakshi Lekhi. The event was followed by a ‘shobha yatra’ or procession that will conclude at Kashi on November 15, before meandering through the state. On Thursday, it had brief stopovers at Mohan Mandir in Ghaziabad and Dadrinagar Shiva temple in Noida while proceeding to Bulandshahr from where it will go to Aligarh, Hathras and Kasganj, where the yatra will halt for a night. On Friday, the procession will move through Etah, Mainpuri, Kannauj and Kanpur, where again it will halt at night. On Saturday, (November 13), the ‘shobha yatra’ will pass through Unnao, Lucknow and Barabanki before another overnight stay at Ayodhya. The idol will reach Varanasi on November 14 via Sultanpur, Pratapgarh and Jaunpur. The ancient idol will be installed at Kashi Vishwanath temple amid Vedic chants on November 15, which happens to be Devotthan Ekadashi. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the homecoming of the idol from Canada, following an agreement with the Canadian government during a Mann ki Baat session last year. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath recently thanked the PM for his relentless effort to preserve the nation’s cultural legacy. During his recent visit to Lucknow on November 3, Union minister Kishan Reddy had said as many as 42 rare idols and antiquities have been returned to India by different countries during the tenure of Prime Minister Modi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/annapurna-idol-given-to-up-on-statewide-yatra/articleshow/87655617.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Police hope crimes associated with illegal bajri trade will plummet||JAIPUR: On the morning of July 12, 2019, Kishore Singh (60) was mowed down outside his house in Kardhani by a truck carrying smuggled sand. Singh’s grisly murder sent shudders across the city, driving home the enormity of sand mafia’s growing footprint. The illegal ‘bajri’ trade became so brazen that even top cops expressed their helplessness in checking it. With the ban being lifted, police are hoping that the illegal trade may finally subside. Sources informed TOI that ever since the ban was imposed on sand mining, middlemen, transporters and cops forged a deep nexus to profit from the sand crunch. Over 600 cases related to illegal mining were filed in the state even as several cops came under the scanner for having ties with the nexus. According to a police official, vehicles escorting a truck illegally transporting sand earned a profit of up to Rs 3,000 per trip. The price of sand before the ban ranged between Rs 750 and Rs 800 a tonne. The illegally mined sand, however, could cost up to Rs 4,500 a tonne. One police officer informed TOI that in several meetings, the matter was raised but in vain. “The ban was breeding a major corruption in the department. No amount of punitive action could discourage people who were reaping a windfall of several lakhs a month,” the official said on the condition of anonymity, adding that not just police, staff of different departments was also willing to turn a blind eye as they vied for their share of the illicit wealth. With profit margins so high, the sand mafia was willing to take whatever risks necessary to carry on with business. So much so, that despite many measures to rein in the mafia, they brazenly defied the security checkpoints and continued with their illegal trade. “If you look at data carefully, foot soldiers of the mafia were mostly history-sheeters, village strongmen or local louts who joined the bajri smuggling syndicate for quick money,” the official said, adding that many former criminals who had cut their teeth in illegal liquor, readily jumped the ship to escort trucks past the police cordons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cops-heave-sigh-of-relief-as-crimes-associated-with-illegal-bajri-trade-would-go-down/articleshow/87655112.cms||---
---||Dehradun||VC of Soban Singh Jeena Univ to step down after HC order; second such cancellation by court||Almora: After serving as the vice-chancellor (VC) of Soban Singh Jeena University for about a year and three months, Narendra Singh Bhandari is set to step down from the post. On Wednesday, the Uttarakhand high court (HC) cancelled the appointment of Bhandari, who assumed office in August 2020. The decision came as the HC was hearing a petition -- filed by Dehradun resident and activist Ravindra Jugran -- which claimed that Bhandari was not eligible for the post as he doesn’t have 10 years of professorship experience, as mandated by the University Grants Commission (UGC). Jugran, in his petition, said that Bhandari has been a professor for about eight years, following which, he was appointed as a member of the Uttarakhand Public Service Commission. After hearing arguments in the case, the division bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice NS Dhanik cancelled Bhandari’s appointment, stating that it violated clause 7.3.0 of the University Grants Commission. When TOI asked if he will challenge the HC order, Bhandari said, “I am yet to receive the court order.” This is the second time the HC has cancelled the appointment of a sitting state university vice-chancellor on this ground. In 2019, CS Nautiyal’s appointment to the post of Doon University VC was cancelled after the court found that he didn’t have 10 years of teaching experience as a professor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/vc-of-soban-singh-jeena-univ-to-step-down-after-hc-order-second-such-cancellation-by-court/articleshow/87654405.cms||---

---||Jaipur||After 4 yrs, SC nod for sandmining from river beds in Raj||Jaipur: The Supreme Court on Thursday gave sanction to sand mining from river beds in the state and approved recommendations made by the central empowered committee (CEC) constituted to look into the matter. Sand mining from river beds has been allowed after almost four years and lease holders are expected to start operations over the next three months after getting environmental clearance (EC) from the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC). Additional chief secretary, mines and petroleum, Subodh Agarwal said, “With our chief minister's efforts, the long-pending issue of illegal bajri mining has been resolved in the state. This will benefit the public at large. At present, there are three large leases operational and five more are expected to start operations soon. More companies will start work as soon they receive EC.” The CEC, constituted by the apex court to look into the issue of illegal sand mining on December 23, 2020, had submitted its report after carrying out a physical inspection. “The recommendations made by the CEC, except recommendation ‘J’, are approved for implementation forthwith,” the court order says. An official with the mining department said the ‘J’ recommendation referred to levying a penalty of Rs 10 lakh per vehicle and Rs 5 lakh per cubic metre of sand seized. The CEC has recommended the MoEFCC to issue EC to all valid letter of intent (LoI) holders recommended by the expert appraisal committee (EAC) within a period of three months and without insisting on the submission of the scientific replenishment report as a pre-condition. The replenishment study will be undertaken during the course of mining. “Out of 82 large leases, the EAC has recommended 65. After the SC nod, they will receive EC within 3 months from the MoEFCC,” an official mining department source said. The SC had earlier restrained operations of large mining lease holders who did not have EC from the ministry. The ministry had later laid a condition for companies to carry out a scientific replenishment study. In its report, the CEC highlighted the delay in granting EC as the main reason for the widening gap between supply and demand, which resulted in the proliferation of illegal mining activities. Following the order, the state government is likely to earn an estimated revenue of Rs 400 crore per annum. A senior mining department official said, “The 65 large leases can mine an estimated 700 lakh tonne from their operations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/after-4-yrs-sc-nod-for-sandmining-from-river-beds-in-raj/articleshow/87655141.cms||Ajay Singh

Public prosecutor Shekar Shetty said that Theresa D’Souza, the retired teacher, gave her pension amount for the year 2006-07 and 2008-09 to her relative Gracie Fernandez, and asked her to deposit it in her account in the nationalised bank’s branch in the city, where she was working. Gracie had failed to deposit the pension amount to Therasa’s account. When she had asked for an update of her passbook, a manual entry was made, and she had issued a fake receipt. A few days later, when Theresa checked her account details, she realised that her account only had Rs 15,571 instead of Rs 5.4 lakh. When she went to Gracie ‘s house to inquire about the amount, she was threatened by the accused and her husband. Based on a complaint, the accused was arrested and a chargesheet was filed. In November 2016, the second additional senior civil judge and chief judicial magistrate had acquitted Gracie. Allowing the appeal by the state government, she was sentenced to four years jail and fined Rs 12,000 for the offence punishable under various IPC sections . She was also sentenced to two years and imposed a fine of Rs 2000 for the offence punishable under Section 379 of IPC (punishment for theft) and one year and fine of Rs 1,000 for the offence under Section 465 of IPC (punishment for forgery). All the sentences will run concurrently. Out of the total fine amount, Rs 10,000 will be given to the retired teacher as compensation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/bank-employee-convicted-for-cheating-retired-school-teacher/articleshow/87653623.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Bengal guv, govt in war of words on investments||Kolkata: Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar said on Thursday that former Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra’s letter “skipped all the five issues” he had flagged over investments at Bengal Global Business Summit, prompting Bengal government seniors to say that “it cannot respond to the governor’s letter every day.” In September 2020, in a detailed reply to the governor, Mitra — now principal chief adviser to the CM and the finance department — had written that proposals received in BGBS from 2015-19 amounted to Rs 12.3 lakh crore. Dhankhar asked Mitra to specify the places where these investments were under way and also the names of the companies. He also wanted Mitra to update him about the status of implementation and people employed in these projects. “We are answerable to people and not the governor and BJP. The CM was gracious enough to invite him but it is unfortunate that he has chosen to interpret the gesture in this manner,” a top Bengal official said. Dhankhar held that Mitra’s letter didn’t answer the issues he had raised about BGBS. Mitra’s 2020 letter had also mentioned that 50.2% of investment proposals were in implementation mode. He said investment proposals of Rs 71,646 crore at BGBS 2019 were already under implementation, and that “the employment so far was to the tune of 28 lakhs.” The senior Bengal official also wondered if the governor “had the constitutional authority to interfere in everyday administrative affairs of the state and that too in public domain by tweeting”. According to senior officials, none of Dhankhar’s predecessors had done this. “Every time BGBS was held, all proposal details were given to the media on the last day and everything is in public domain,” an official added. Incidentally, the chief minister invited the governor for the meet and greet programme on Monday this week where the dates of BGBS 2022 were announced. The CM also requested the governor to visit a foreign country to promote the state, which the latter accepted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-guv-govt-in-war-of-words-on-investments/articleshow/87655139.cms||---
---||Delhi||Covid-19: Delhi government goes door to door to bring 17.5 lakh in vaccination net||NEW DELHI: Though nearly nine out of 10 adults in the national capital have received at least one dose of vaccine against Covid-19, the Delhi government is carrying out a major drive to identify and vaccinate more than 17.5 lakh people who remain unvaccinated. Till 6pm on Sunday, Delhi had seen a cumulative 2,10,47,046 vaccine doses being administered, including 1,32,49,130 first doses and 77,97,916 second doses. With the number of people eligible for vaccination in Delhi being around 1.5 crore, almost 52% of the adults have been fully vaccinated and 88.3% have received at least one dose. Considering the approximate number of Delhiites who are above the age of 18 years and eligible for the vaccination, more than 17.5 lakh adults haven’t received a single dose. The number is a cause of concern and was discussed in a meeting of Delhi Disaster Management Authority in October, sources said. The Delhi government has started a house-to-house survey, which is part of the decision taken in the DDMA meeting to implement a “targeted approach” to reach out to the remaining eligible beneficiaries without even a single dose of vaccine, they added. The survey is being carried out by civil defence volunteers to identify the population that has been left out either due to vaccine hesitancy or any other reason. The government is also carrying out an extensive information, education and communication campaign to create awareness, including awareness about the necessity of getting the second dose on time. Mobile teams have also been mobilised at district levels to reach out to non-vaccinated beneficiaries. The vaccination by these teams are carried out from vehicles or small sites in localities. Camps are also set up near locations of Chhath Puja celebrations this week. The government is going to organise more special camps, sources said. While a huge dip was seen in the number of vaccine doses being administered in the first week of November during the festive season, the numbers have started climbing up. The average number of vaccine doses in the first week of November was 36,532 doses a day, but on the first four days of the current week, more than 80,000 cumulative doses have been administered, except on Wednesday. North West district has administered the highest number of total vaccine doses at 25,05,395, followed by South West at 24,38,521 and West at 22,55,632. On the other hand, North East district has seen the least number of total doses at 13,49,225.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-goes-door-to-door-to-bring-17-5-lakh-in-vax-net/articleshow/87655627.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The victims are Bilal Wani (35) and Sabir Batt (36), both residents of Pahalgaon police station area of Jammu and Kashmir. Wani has lodged a complaint with Doranda police station in this regard. The police have nabbed the accused identified as Raj Kishore alias Kishori, a resident of Pathal Road in Doranda. Wani said when he, along with Batt, reached the Hathikhana colony, Kishori tried to force them to shout “Jai Shri Ram” and “Pakistan murdabad”. He said the accused started assaulting them when they refused and they were saved only when local people intervened. Wani said similar assaults have occurred against other Kashmiri youths several times in the recent past. The police sent both of them to the local hospital for adequate treatment. Wani said, “As soon as we started displaying our products before a customer in Doranda the accused approached us and asked to shout the slogans if we wanted to stay here. He started hitting us with his fist and leg while asking his brother for a gun to shoot me.” Wani said he is also a citizen of this country and has all the rights to stay wherever he wants. He mentioned that he has been visiting Ranchi for the past 20 years to sell woollens. Ranchi senior superintendent of police Surindra Jha said, “The accused in the case Raj Kishore alias Kishori has been arrested. He is a drug addict. The police are sensitive towards safety of all residents, including people visiting this place.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/2-kashmiri-youths-forced-to-chant-jai-shri-ram-beaten-up-in-ranchi/articleshow/87653901.cms||Sanjay Sahay

There are also reports of gold chains snatching from the same area. Two minors have been detained for questioning in this connection, police said. Though police complaints are yet to be lodged, there is information that similar incidents took place in other parts of Jamshedpur too at various river ghats. Before the commencement of the Chhath, district police had assured that it would post policemen in plain clothes at all river ghats to thwart such thefts and snatching incidents. In another incident under Azadnagar police station area, thieves broke into a house and decamped with gold ornaments and valuables worth around Rs 3 lakh. A complaint has been filed in this connection. House burglary reports have been filed at Parsudih police station too. Sources said that when the family members had gone to their relative’s house to take part in Chhath, thieves broke into their house and decamped with valuables. Sources said family members had gone to the river ghat to perform Chhath, when goons broke into the house and stole valuables on Thursday morning. In neighbouring Seraikela-Kharsawan district, there are reports of firing between two rival gangs at a Chhath ghat on Thursday. Police said one Vikki Nandi was the target of the goons. Vikki and two other women present at the spot were injured in the attack. They are undergoing treatment. Police have recovered cartridges from the spot. Sources said the firing was a fallout of an old rivalry between Vikki and other miscreants in the area. Taking advantage of the large gathering, the goons had come to kill Vikki at the ghat, said the victim’s relatives. Police added they are going through the CCTV footage from the cameras installed at that spot to find those involved in the attack. Police assured that those involved will be in their net soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/thieves-burglars-have-a-field-day-as-devotees-throng-ghats-for-chhath/articleshow/87654183.cms||Debasish Chatterjee
---||Ranchi||JMM, Congress against November 15 as Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas||RANCHI: Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Congress, the two key parties governing Jharkhand, on Thursday reacted to the Centre’s decision to observe tribal revolutionary Birsa Munda’s birth anniversary as Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas. The two political outfits vocally opposed the announcement and claimed that the Narendra Modi-led government must include Sarna religious code in the upcoming census if it really wanted to give the tribal communities their due honour. JMM’s Giridih MLA and party general secretary Sudivya Kumar said, “Sarna religious code is associated with the very existence of the tribal communities and a resolution was also passed by Jharkhand Vidhan Sabha in this regard. If the Union cabinet approves a separate Sarna religious code, it will actually be an honest effort to preserve the existence of the tribal communities.” Congress called the announcement a political agenda. “When there was a double government in Jharkhand under former chief minister Raghubar Das, nothing was done to give the tribal revolutionaries of the state their due honour. Now, when the BJP is not in power, they have suddenly remembered Bhagwan Birsa Munda,” Jharkhand Congress president Rajesh Thakur told TOI on Thursday. He added, “It is nothing but a political agenda. None of the 12 BJP MPs from Jharkhand could ever muster the courage to seek a separate religious code for the practitioners for Sarna religious faith in the Parliament. And here they are, using Bhagwan Birsa Munda’s name to strike a chord with the people for their political gains.” Soon after the Union cabinet’s announcement, BJP lawmakers in the state joined the bandwagon in thanking Modi. State BJP president Deepak Prakash and former CM Babulal Marandi called the announcement a recognition for the fighting spirit of the tribal communities of the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/sarna-code-not-gaurav-diwas-real-tribute-to-tribal-communities-jmm-cong/articleshow/87653983.cms||Dhritiman Ray

He was involved in more than a dozen criminal cases and was imprisoned several times. He recently came out of Central Jail in Hazaribag and was residing in the town area.

---||Ranchi||PM Modi to inaugurate Birsa park on tribal icon’s birth anniversary||RANCHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate Ranchi’s Birsa Munda Memorial Jail Park on November 15 virtually from New Delhi. The inauguration will officially mark the first Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas, which was announced by the Union cabinet on Wednesday. The Union government aims to celebrate the valour of tribal revolutionaries through the Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas. Jharkhand celebrates its statehood day on November 15, which is the birth anniversary of tribal revolutionary Birsa Munda. The park has been built in and around the 200-year-old Ranchi Central Jail. It was in this jail that Birsa Munda, who is regarded as one of India’s tallest revolutionaries, died in British captivity on June 9, 1900. Envisioned in 2013, the park has been built under the patronage of the Union ministry of tribal affairs at a cost of Rs 26 crore by the state urban development development’s subsidiary Jharkhand Urban Infrastructure Development Company (JUIDCO). Once inaugurated, the 15-acre facility will be operated under public private partnership (PPP) under the watch of Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC). “A committee has been set up for drafting the operational policies. The draft will be then put up before the cabinet for its approval,” a JUIDCO official said. “Besides PM Modi, who will remain virtually present, Governor Ramesh Bais, chief minister Hemant Soren and Union tribal affairs minister Arjun Munda will attend the event in-person in Ranchi. State tribal affairs minister Champai Soren, Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth, Ranchi MLA CP Singh and Ranchi mayor Asha Lakra will also attend the event,” a senior official in the urban development department said on anonymity. Though state urban development secretary Vinay Kumar Choubey could not be contacted, Munda’s office confirmed the inauguration. The present day park was chosen by Soren during his first stint as CM in 2013 for restoration of the old jail. Later, when BJP was voted to power in 2014 the construction for setting up a museum began during the tenure of erstwhile CM Raghubar Das. It was held up on multiple occasions. Three separate agencies were roped in for restoring the old jail building, setting up the museum and landscaping of the complex. The restoration of the jail building, which will house the museum, was completed in 2019. Besides Birsa, the museum will house statues of 10 tribal revolutionaries from Jharkhand. There will be light and sound shows and visitors will be shown brief documentaries of the tribal heroes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/prime-minister-to-inaugurate-birsa-park-on-tribal-icons-birth-anniv/articleshow/87654096.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Titled The Ugly Side of Beauty, the film digs deep into the hidden world of mica mining in Koderma and Giridih districts and explores the trade that feeds voracious demand for beauty products. But on the flipside, it showcases how the poor and marginalized, including children in these mica-rich districts, continue to battle hunger, poverty, environment and health hazards. The awards took place in Tokyo on November 9 through a virtual ceremony wherein the film received laurels among 267 entries from 48 countries competing this year. The Japan Prize was organised by NHK (Japanese broadcaster), said the makers. Established in 1965 by NHK, the Japan Prize is an international contest that honours the top educational programmes worldwide. The film is produced by The Moving Visuals Co. in Singapore. While Deepak was roped in from India for this project, other key players for this film included Sumitra Gopal (producer), and Galen Yeo (creative director). This Sunday, Bara has now scheduled an open screening of the film at city-based XISS. Talking to TOI on Thursday, Bara said the main aim behind making a documentary on this subject was to initiate debate around the raging problem surrounding mica industry in Jharkhand for decades and prompting authorities to wake up. He said, “Even in undivided Bihar, there wasn’t any consolidated policy for regulating mica industry here. After creation of Jharkhand too, nothing has been done so far. As a result, about 10 lakh people, mostly tribals in Koderma and Giridih, are forced to do illegal mica mining risking their lives but end up earning less than minimum wages per day. Over the years, people are living in disastrous zone here.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/docu-on-mica-bags-international-award/articleshow/87653954.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Speaking after the flag-off, Prakash told media persons that he will speak to Union railway minister Ashwini Vaishnav and urge him to ensure a stoppage of the train in Lohardaga. “Lohardaga is an old district headquarters and has an identity of its own.

Participating in the Times Now Summit, he claimed that the ‘Muslim vote bank’ was a myth that was shatttered by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2014 eletions. On the contrary, there has always been a ‘Hindu vote bank’ in the country, he argued. Asked about his views on Muslim communalism, the leader of the Hyderabad-based Muslim outfit said, “Any form of communalism is bad for our country. I am not promoting communalism. What I am saying is that we should get a fair share.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/muslims-must-get-their-fair-share-aimim-chief-owaisi/articleshow/87656518.cms||---
---||India||Government feeding OTT platforms’ growth by allowing self-regulation: Anurag Thakur||NEW DELHI: The media and entertainment industry, and Over The Top (OTT) platforms in particular, will fuel economic and job growth in the next few years and government encourages this trend by allowing OTT platforms to self-regulate, information and broadcasting and sports minister Anurag Thakur said at the Times Now Summit on Thursday. Acknowledging the exponential growth of OTT platforms, Thakur said the media and entertainment industry is projected to be worth Rs 4 lakh crore by 2025 and that OTT platforms alone have the potential to employ 80 lakh persons. With expected investments worth Rs 30,000 crore in the next three years, of which 45% is likely to be through FDI, Thakur said India is also the world’s 6th largest OTT market, despite still being in its nascent stages of growth. He did not agree with claims of “over censorship” by the government and said OTT platforms have been allowed to self-regulate. “There is a three-tier mechanism for complaint redressal and 95% of the complaints they received are settled at their own level,” he said. Congratulating Times Now Navbharat for its proposed launch on the Standard Definition platform effective January 1 next year, Union I&B minister Anurag Thakur said, “We all want Navbharat to be prosperous and powerful. In this, the role of Times Now Navbharat is also significant; for delivering accurate news to the masses. For this I congratulate you all.” In his capacity as sports minister, he said the government has taken several steps to step-up training facilities for elite and upcoming athletes through initiatives like Mission Olympic Cell and Khelo India, and that the ministry will, in the coming months, launch app-based training modules for coaches and athletes to ensure that international best practices reach the maximum number of aspiring sportspersons. Thakur also said social media platforms are powerful tools to inform people, but condemned recent instances of Indian cricket players being targeted on social media for their performances. “Social media is for you to state your point of view, but not to make objectionable statements about anyone . Those who represent India put in every effort for the country and it is absolutely condemnable when someone is targeted over their religion or poor performance,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-feeding-ott-platforms-growth-by-allowing-self-regulation-anurag-thakur/articleshow/87656504.cms||---
---||Delhi||Murders down, street crimes rising in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Murders, the prime indicator of the crime situation in a city, declined this year, Delhi Police data shows. From 393 murders reported till October 31 last year, 379 were lodged in the same time period this year. Sources said the number of crime-related murders were fewer and a majority were the fallout of personal enmity and sudden provocation with the accused and the victim being known to each other. Overall, heinous crimes rose slightly with 4,614 cases reported in 2020 against 4,666 this year. With lockdowns imposed due to the pandemic being lifted, crimes on road, like vehicle thefts and snatchings, seemed to be heading back to their pre-Covid numbers of 2019. Vehicle thefts, for example, rose by around 9% with 31,374 cases registered till October 31 this year against 28,732 last year. Throughout 2020, around 35,000 cases were reported. In 2019 and the year before, over 46,000 cases were reported. There was a slight increase in crimes like dacoity (8 last year and 20 this year) and kidnapping for ransom (10 last year against 15 this year). Fatal and non-fatal accidents also rose in 2021, something attributed to vehicles getting back on the roads in full capacity. While 958 fatal accidents were reported till October 31 this year, the figure was 908 in 2020. In all, 2,823 non-fatal accidents were reported this year against 2,486 cases in 2020. While 688 cases of riots (mostly in northeast Delhi) were reported last year, 58 cases were lodged this year. Most districts were able to keep street crime under check this year. Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana had instructed all joint and special commissioners to focus on reducing street crimes in their respective zones. With the integration of PCR vans and their personnel with police station staff and separation of law and order duties from crime investigation, things appeared bright strength-wise, said officers. Asthana is learnt to have asked all DCPs to prepare a roadmap for the coming months by conducting studies in their areas to map crime hotspots. Special Cell and Crime Branch have been tasked with escalating crackdown on gunrunners and related syndicates to curb the influx of arms and ammunition in the capital. Action is being taken against members of organised crime syndicates under MCOCA and coordination with jail administration is being done to curb their illegal activities inside the prisons, a senior officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/murders-down-street-crimes-on-the-up/articleshow/87655045.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ED raids over fraud linked to Nawab Malik-controlled Wakf Board||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED), as part of a money laundering probe, on Thursday raided premises of six people in Pune for fraudulently claiming nearly Rs 8 crore compensation in lieu of surrendering land belonging to a trust registered with the Wakf Board. The Wakf Board comes under the state minority development minister, Nawab Malik of the NCP. No search was conducted on any office of the Wakf Board, which is the complainant in the related police case. Malik also said that ED had not raided any Wakf Board office. It is stated that the six people who had received state government compensation in their personal accounts are suspected to be a front for some powerful persons. The ED is probing the money trail to trace the beneficiaries. The money laundering case is based on an FIR filed at the Bund Garden police station in Pune in August 2021 by the Pune regional officer of the Maharashtra Wakf Board. Accused forged NOC, got Rs 8 crore payout from govt for trust landRecently, the ED collected documents related to the Pune police case and subsequently registered the money laundering case. Early on Thursday, ED officials formed seven teams, and they raided the premises of thesix accused, who were believed to have acted on the instructions of someone else. The ED has recorded the statement of five of the accused persons and accordingly will decide the next course of action, sources said. Sources stated "the six persons are from the lower strata of life and not capable of committing the crime of such a magnitude, to cheat the government. One of the six accused is on the run." According to the case, the Tabut Inam Endowment Trust, registered with Wakf Board, owned a piece of land at Maan Village, Mulshi taluka,in Pune district. The government acquired the land for the Rajiv Gandhi IT Park and announced Rs 8.76 crore as compensation to the land owner. The accused, reportedly in connivance with some other persons, represented themselves as office-bearers of the Tabut trust and forged a Wakf Board NOC to get Rs 7.9 crore compensation released by the government. The accused were exposed after the trust complained to Wakf Board that it did not receive compensation in lieu ofits land. During further inquiry, it was disclosed six persons had represented themselves as office-bearers of the trust and, with help of fabricated documents, convinced the collector's office to release compensation. The demand draft was deposited into personal accounts of the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-ed-raids-over-fraud-linked-to-nawab-malik-controlled-wakf-board/articleshow/87656590.cms||Vijay Singh

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Curfew imposed in Amravati as bandh call turns violent||NAGPUR: Internet services were shut down and a four-day curfew was imposed on Saturday in Amravati, about 150 kms from Nagpur, as the bandh call by a political party turned violent. BJP's bandh call was in response to Friday's rallies by certain organizations to protest alleged the communal flare up in Tripura, which resulted in some shops and offices being damaged. On Saturday, the bandh turned violent after police received reports of stone pelting and damage of vehicles and shops. Police lathicharged the mob in an effort to disperse the crowd, while also appealing to everyone to return home. On Saturday morning, hundreds of people, many of them holding saffron flags in their hands and raising slogans, came out on streets in Rajkamal Chowk area of the eastern Maharashtra city, located around 670 km from Mumbai. Some members of the mob hurled stones at shops in Rajkamal Chowk and other places, the police official said, adding that the police lathi-charged the protesters to bring the situation under control.  Against the backdrop of back-to-back incidents of stone-pelting on Friday and Saturday, additional police commissioner Sandip Patil issued orders imposing curfew in the city limits of Amravati under sections 144(1), (2), (3) of the CrPc to avoid any untoward incidents. Except for medical emergencies, people are not allowed to come out of houses. A gathering of more than five people is not allowed, as per the order. On Friday, over eight thousand people had gathered outside the Amravati district collector's office to submit a memorandum demanding that atrocities against the minority community be stopped, officials had said. When people were leaving after submitting the memorandum, stone-pelting took place at three places between Chitra Chowk and Cotton Market under the limits of the Kotwali police station. On Friday, stone-pelting was reported during rallies taken out by Muslim organisations to protest against incidents in Tripura at Amravati, Nanded, Malegaon, Washim and Yavatmal. Police have so far arrested 20 people and detained four others by registering 20 FIRs under various charges, including rioting, in connection with Friday's incidents. In Amravati, over 8,000 people had gathered outside the district collector's office on Friday to submit a memorandum demanding that atrocities against the minority community in Tripura be stopped. When people were leaving after submitting the memorandum, stone-pelting took place at three places between Chitra Chowk and Cotton Market under the limits of the Kotwali police station. On Saturday, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis said, “I appeal to both communities to remain calm and maintain law and order. The entire flare up is over something which never took place in Tripura, in fact the police there have released photos showing that no place of worship was damaged. Yet on social media some people instigated citizens and caused this furore." After minor incidents of stone-pelting reported on Friday from Nanded, Amravati and Malegaon (Nashik), home minister Dilip Walse-Patil made a late-night video appeal for restrain from all groups. "Please maintain calma I appeal to all Hindus and Muslims brethren to maintain peace," Walse-Patil urged, along with other leaders of Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. "I am monitoring the entire situation with the help of senior police officers and discussing with senior Opposition leaders. All those guilty would not be spareda We all must maintain social harmony and I request all to cooperate with us. I request the same to my police brothers to handle the situation cautiously and to maintain peace," he added. Meanwhile, launching a veiled attack on opposition BJP, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Saturday said the violence in Amravati and other places was aimed at destabilising the MVA government.  Speaking to reporters in Aurangabad, Raut said the state government is firm in the saddle and real faces of the perpetrators of violence will be exposed soon. "Raising the bogey of violence, they (Opposition) will meet the state governor and write letters to the Union home ministry claiming that the (law and order) situation in Maharashtra is deteriorating. This will happen in the future too. But the state government is firm in the saddle," Raut said. Amravati district guardian minister Yashomati Thakur said some anti-social elements are trying to vitiate the atmosphere by throwing stones at shops. "The state government will take necessary action. However, some people are using this for political gains," she said and appealed to people to not believe rumours. AIMIM MP Imtiaz Jaleel has also condemned the violence in Amravati. "I want to question those leaders in the state who came to power by taking the votes of Muslims why they didn't condemn the violence in Tripura. If this violence in Maharashtra is a 'tit for tat' by any political party then this is the example of irresponsibility," he said.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Supreme Court nixes panel's view that roadside trees 'not forest'||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday expressed scepticism on the view of a committee it had itself set up when the panel submitted that extending the definition of 'forest' to 'planted trees on non-notified land' will only discourage planting of trees along roadsides on common land. The panel's reply was filed on an application by DMRC seeking the SC's nod for felling of trees for construction of Phase IV of the Metro project, which would be 20 km long, from Aerocity to Tughlakabad. Around 10,000 trees will have to be axed for the project. A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao, B R Gavai and B V Nagarathna, which is examining DMRC's plea, said the stand taken by the committee could not be accepted. "We are not going to accept that all planted trees are not forest. It would lead to chaos. Who will decide whether a tree is planted one or grown naturally?" it asked. Advocate A D N Rao, appearing for the committee, contended that the panel took the stand on the basis of the apex court's earlier verdict in 1996 that trees planted in a project area cannot be branded as forests. "The Government of India guidelines specifically exclude all plantations raised outside the notified forests/recorded forests from the purview of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. Only lands with naturally grown trees outside the notified/reserved forest are treated as deemed forest," the committee said. "It is therefore recommended for consideration of this court that the prayer of the applicant to declare that the 5.34 km stretch of Road No. 26 between Vikaspuri to Peeragarhi, 1288.973 sqm land at Najafgarh drain, 16097.75 sqm land located at Mangolpuri and 55.78 sqm of Krishna Park are nonforest areas is allowed, subject to the condition that the DMRC will fell the trees only after obtaining permission under the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994 from the concerned authorities and after complying with the conditions associated with such approvals, including compensatory planting of 10 times the number of trees close to the site from where the trees are being felled," the committee said. The court proceedings also witnessed the Delhi government and Centre opposing each other fiercely on the issue with Delhi's counsel contended that the area was part of forest and the showcause notice is being issued for felling of trees. The solicitor general accused Delhi of blocking the Metro project, which is a lifeline of the people. Advocate Chirag Shroff, for Delhi govt, also raised an objection to Tushar Mehta, appearing for DMRC, saying that there was a conflict of interest between the Centre and DMRC. Mehta, also appearing for the environment ministry, told the bench that the Centre was not against the project like Delhi government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-supreme-court-nixes-panels-view-that-roadside-trees-not-forest/articleshow/87656616.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||India||For judge slur, CBI seeks deportation of 2 from US||NEW DELHI: The CBI is seeking the Interpol’s assistance in securing deportation of two men who are currently believed to be in the US and are wanted in a case of posting of derogatory remarks about judges and judiciary on social media platforms. The agency is also using diplomatic channels in getting their hands on the two suspects — C Prabhakar Reddy aka ‘Punch’ Prabhakar and Mani Annapureddy — in the case after locating their whereabouts using a Blue Notice. The CBI also moved through Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) channel for gathering the information related to the Facebook profiles, Twitter accounts, Facebook posts, tweets, YouTube videos from Facebook, Twitter, Google details etc of the suspects. A CBI spokesperson informed on Thursday that the agency had got arrest warrants issued against the two persons and had also filed six more chargesheets in the case. The six accused were arrested by CBI on October 22 from different places in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and are presently in judicial custody. The suspects have been accused of making objectionable comments on judges of judges of the Andhra Pradesh high court over certain verdicts. The CBI’s move to seek international assistance in the case comes in the wake of the Supreme Court expressing its annoyance with the failure of the investigating agencies to nab the accused. In August this year, a bench headed by Chief Justice of India N V Ramana rued that judges were not on priority for investigating agencies and that their complaints of being harassed or intimidated were not heeded despite specialised bodies like CBI being roped in. The CBI had had earlier arrested five accused in July and August and also filed five separate chargesheets against them. With this, 11 separate chargesheets have been filed against all the 11 accused arrested so far in the case. The agency has also examined Lok Sabha MP Nandigam Suresh and former MLA Amanchi Krishnamohan, both belonging to YSR Congress, in the case. The CBI had registered the case on November 11 last year against 16 people and taken over investigation of 12 FIRs from CID, Andhra Pradesh, in pursuance of the orders of the high court. The original FIRs were registered on complaints of Registrar General of high court of Andhra Pradesh. The agency has also had many of the objectionable posts removed and YouTube channels blocked from the social media platforms and public domain. During investigation, a total of 13 digital gadgets including mobiles, tablets have been recovered, the CBI informed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/for-judge-slur-cbi-seeks-deportation-of-2-from-us/articleshow/87656634.cms||Rajshekhar Jha

We are declaring names for the people of Goa and let the party be decided later,” he said. “I’m a BJP MLA and will speak to the party and if they don’t listen to us then other options are open,” the minister said. Lobo said that the people of Goa will decide who will form the next government in Goa When asked from which party he, his wife Delilah and Sudhir Kandolkar will contest, Lobo said, “I have given names of probable candidates, these are good candidates and people are searching for good candidates. There is no problem even if they are from the opposition.” Asked about the talk in political circles that he wants to have control over Bardez taluka, Lobo said there is nothing like that. “We will go across the state and tell people to elect good people because it is not a question of five months, it is of five years,” he said. “It is not like that,” Lobo said when asked whether it is an indication that he will not continue with BJP. “We want good candidates. People of Goa want good candidates so that their work is addressed and solved, whether it is water or electricity. We are fighting for basic things.” “I will announce the names of more candidates not only in Bardez, but beyond Bardez. We will announce names of candidates who will work for people and I will take the responsibility of that candidate. When I take the name of Kandolkar, and if he does not perform, then it is our responsibility,” he said. Lobo said that he is not eying the chief minister’s post. He said that he will study and announce the name for Aldona constituency. Further, he said that if the sitting MLA is good, then there is no need to announce other names.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lobo-will-announce-more-candidates-for-22-polls-let-party-be-decided-later/articleshow/87654887.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Seek nod, pay fees to erect shacks in port limits: MPT||Vasco: Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) has no problem with shacks being erected at Baina beach and nearby beaches, but shack operators need to obtain the requisite permission from the port authorities and pay the stipulated fees first, said MPT deputy chairman Guru Prasad Rai on Thursday. Rai said that MPT wants to encourage tourism in the state and is willing to co-operate with Goa Tourism and Development Corporation in the shack allotment process. MPT is facing a backlash after it stopped the erection of two shacks at Baina beach citing lack of permission issues. “Anything that is to be established in port waters and port jurisdiction, needs to take permission from the port. In future also, whenever the state government is allotting permission for shacks, we will go and check the feasiblity and give permission,” said Rai. Rai’s statement is in consonance with the Major Port Authorities Act, 2021 which supersedes Goa’s planning laws. Deputy chief minister and town and country planning minister Chandrakant Kavlekar had admitted in the state legislative assembly that Goa would lose revenue ideally owed to the state for the development that is undertaken in certain zones. “The likely implications include redundancy of Goa Town & Country Planning Act, 2021 and the Regional Plan or outline development plans, Goa Municipalities Act, Goa Panchayat Raj Act, Goa Land Development and Building Construction Regulations, 2010 and Goa Land Revenue Code,” Kavlekar had said in February. Kavlekar said that areas in the periphery of Mormugao Port Trust could come under the “ownership” of MPT, while local powers of the state, including the power to allot shacks in MPTs jurisdiction, would be lost. Chief minister Pramod Sawant had written to the Union ports minister on June 17 conveying Goa’s concerns regarding the Major Ports Authorities Act, 2021, but the Centre brushed aside Goa’s apprehensions. Urban development minister and Mormugao MLA Milind Naik said that there is a misunderstanding, and that he has spoken to the state government to clear the matter with MPT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/seek-nod-pay-fees-to-erect-shacks-in-port-limits-mpt/articleshow/87654936.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Shack owners seek CM’s help to carry on business at Baina||Panaji: The Shack Owners Welfare Society (SOWS) has sought the intervention of chief minister Pramod Sawant to deter Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) from interfering with shack allottees at the Baina and Arossim beaches in South Goa. The plea comes after two allottees at Baina beach were allegedly stopped by MPT officials earlier this week over claims that the beach stretch where the shacks were allotted lay in its jurisdiction. “We have informed both the chief minister and the tourism minister about this issue. The CM should talk directly to the MPT. If not stopped, I’m afraid it will allot the space to people from outside Goa,” SOWS president Cruz Cardozo told TOI. “It is unfortunate that the shack operators have lost over a month after having endured two bad seasons due to the MPT’s objections.” He explained that shack operators have been setting up their structures at the two beaches for years and that the MPT has no rights there. Allottees at Baina had faced similar problems during the last season too, with MPT raising objections, he recalled, following which the issue was sorted with government intervention. Shacks are allotted by the tourism department along all beach stretches after assessing the post-monsoon condition of each beach. The exercise has been conducted every season for over three decades now. Two shacks are allotted for Baina beach and four for Arossim. While the allottees at Arossim have erected their structures despite objections, those at Baina are yet to set up. The SOWS, Cardozo said, has written to the tourism department apprising it of the issue. “We were informed by the tourism director that the department has written to the MPT instructing it not to interfere,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/shack-owners-seek-cms-help-to-carry-on-business-at-baina/articleshow/87654892.cms||---
---||Goa||Inflated bills shock users as free water promise runs out||PANAJI: Residents in parts of Socorro and Sangolda got a shock of their lives after they received water bills for the month of October that showed a six-time increase in charges. Assured by Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant a couple of months ago that they would not have to pay for piped water from September 1, the PWD water consumers, most of them holding blue-collar jobs, are wondering how to pay the bills. Sangolda resident Saraswati (name changed), who used to get a water bill of Rs 500 on an average, suddenly found herself staring at a bill of Rs 3,387. “I went to the staff at the Porvorim office, who told me that there must be a leakage. If there is leakage, why were the earlier bills lower? I asked him if we are supposed to spend all our earnings to pay the water bill, to which he snapped back and told me to complain to the government,” she said. Two months ago, Sawant had announced that Goa would become the first state in the country to supply water free of cost to its citizens. He had launched the ‘Save Water to Get Free Water’ scheme under which households would not be charged for consumption up to 16,000 litres per month. When TOI reached out to a PWD official, he explained that the bills could be on the higher side if the billing period was more than 30 days. He said that due to the Covid-19 pandemic, meter readers were not going to certain areas where infections were high. “If the locality has a high number of Covid-19 cases, the meter reader could himself contract the virus, and thus, meter readings are not taken for a month or two,” said the official who is not authorised to give a statement. The PWD issues water bills for 30-45 days, but in this case, Saraswati’s bill was for 70 days. Several other residents of Porvorim also complained of receiving inflated water bills, but TOI could not get copies of the bills. They complained that given the erratic water supply, the inflated bills made no sense. “As it is, the flow of water is a trickle and supply is erratic, so much so that we have to draw water from our neighbours wells,” said Saraswati.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/inflated-bills-shock-users-as-free-water-promise-runs-out/articleshow/87654925.cms||---

Meanwhile, a little-known outfit Mujahideen Ghazwatul Hind, while claiming responsibility for an "attack", said three of its cadres have "attacked the CRPF camp". Earlier in the day, an encounter broke out in Kulgam district of south Kashmir. The officials said acting on specific inputs about the presence of militants in Chawalgam area of Kulgam, security forces launched a cordon and search operation there. As the forces were conducting the searches in the area, the militants fired upon them, they said. The forces retaliated leading to an encounter in which a militant was killed, the officials said.

---||World||Pakistan's NSA denies offering amnesty to TTP members||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s National Security Adviser (NSA) Moeed Yusuf on Wednesday night denied offering amnesty to members of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) even as the Imran Khan government continues to negotiate for peace and reconciliation with the banned terror outfit in Afghanistan since the Taliban took control of that country in mid-August. “I don’t know where this talk started from — that a decision has been made. There is no such decision of a general amnesty,” Yusuf said in a TV interview. At the same time, Yusuf’s statement during the interview that “no such decision has been taken yet” does not completely rule out such a possibility in future. The NSA defended his government’s position, saying that it was talking to the TTP from a position of strength. “The situation has changed in Afghanistan with the Taliban takeover. They are not as antagonistic towards Pakistan as the former president Ashraf Ghani’s government. Now the discussion has started as the support base provided to the TTP by Ghani’s government and India no longer exists,” he said. He alleged that the militant group had been receiving support from India and Afghan intelligence for the last 10-15 years. The talks with the terrorist organisation responsible for thousands of deaths across Pakistan, majority of them innocent civilians, including kids, women and members of minority communities, has created an uproar in Pakistan. The chief justice of Pakistan’s Supreme Court had summoned PM Imran Khan on Wednesday and gave him a tough time in a case related to TTP’s massacre of 132 children and 15 others inside a school in Peshawar in 2014. One of the judges had questioned Khan why “we are bringing them (TTP) back to the negotiating table instead of taking action against them”. The issue of amnesty to TTP members was first raised by President Dr Arif Alvi. Subsequently, foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi linked it with end to terrorist attacks and finally the PM mentioned it during an interview with a foreign TV station, asking the militants to shun militancy, return to the country and start living like normal human beings. Two Afghan figures familiar with the talks said that in return, the TTP have demanded from Pakistan release of their fighters and leaders, control over parts of the tribal regions and rule by their strict interpretation of Islamic Shariah law in those areas, as well as the right to keep their weapons. A conversation with senior defence officials revealed that the decision to ink an agreement with the militants was made after taking into consideration the evolving situation in Afghanistan following the exit of American forces and Taliban seizing the power. One of the officials said that Pakistan has no longer the support of US drones to target the top TTP leaders and fighters having sanctuaries in Afghanistan. The US had eliminated all TTP chiefs since the group’s formation in 2007 and had financially backed Pakistan’s military offensives against the Pakistani Taliban in the restive tribal districts and parts of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in the northwest. Since the group is currently stationed in Afghanistan’s border provinces with Pakistan, some senior defence officials believe, it seems unfeasible and almost impossible to move against it in another country. Despite failure of talks and agreements with terrorists in past, several security officials observed that dialogue was still a better option to address the issue due to lack of other options. Following the return of Taliban to power after 20 years, Islamabad’s foremost demand from the new Afghan rulers was to use their clout to stop the TTP from using their soil for terrorist attacks against Pakistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistans-nsa-denies-offering-amnesty-to-ttp-members/articleshow/87654519.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

On when vaccination for children could start as Zydus Cadila's Covid vaccine has been granted emergency use authorisation for those 12-year-old and above, he said children were not being inoculated against Covid-19 on a large scale anywhere in the world though it has been initiated in some countries in a limited manner. "We do not want to rush this thing. Since this is a matter related to children, the expert group is carrying out further studies," he said at the 'Times Now Summit 2021'. All the vaccines which have currently received emergency use authorisation will be granted full authorisation only after a detailed study and based on the data of four to five years, he said. "It is through data and experience we have learnt that even after vaccination Covid can happen. Then again, data emerged stating that after vaccination one does not get severe Covid. The first dose gives 96 per cent protection and both doses give 98.5 per cent protection. "About vaccinating the children, we will make a decision based on expert opinion. We have decided to think and evaluate before going ahead with vaccinating children as they are the future of our country and we need to tread with caution in this matter," the minister said. On the probability of administering a booster dose, he said adequate stocks are available and the aim is to complete the vaccination of the target population with two doses. After that, a decision on booster dose would be taken based on expert recommendation, Mandaviya said. "The government cannot take a direct decision in such a matter. When the Indian Council of Medical Research and expert team will say that a booster dose should be given, we will consider it then," he said, adding Prime Minister Narendra Modi has always depended on expert opinion, be it vaccine research, manufacturing or approval. Despite a large population and diverse challenges, nearly 80 per cent of India's adult population have taken at least the first dose. The country's vaccination performance has been remarkable, Mandaviya said. About Covaxin's approval by WHO, the minister said that he had discussed the matter with WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on more than a couple of occasions to understand the requirements a vaccine needed to fulfil to get the clearance. "It is a matter of great pride that a vaccine developed and manufactured in India has been given EUA status." Asked if the delay in getting the EUA was because Covaxin is an Indian vaccine and if there was there any discrimination against India, the Mandaviya replied, "I will not get into this matter." He informed that 97 countries have recognised Covishield and Covaxin. In the coming days, vaccines manufactured in India will be made available around the globe at affordable rates, Mandaviya said and stressed India will play a major role in global covid vaccination efforts. "We will get 31 crore doses in November with more due in December. Another five to six companies are set to come to India to manufacture vaccines here. We will help meet the world's requirement for Covid vaccines by providing $18 to 20 vaccines at $3 to 4. This is our commitment," he said. The minister said that 16 crore vaccine doses are lying with the states and Union Territories. Referring to the 'Har Ghar Dastak' vaccination at doorstep campaign, he said, "By December 31 we want to complete our target of vaccinating people aged 18 and above. It now depends on people's support." Asked about the possibility of a third wave, Mandaviya said, "Covid is not over. Cases are rising globally. In Russia, China, Hong Kong cases are rising again despite more than 80 per cent vaccination. Vaccination and Covid-appropriate behaviour have to go hand in hand." On preparations for a probable third wave, he said Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission has been launched and Rs 65,000 crore will be spent in the next five years to ramp up the health infrastructure across the country. The aim is to form such a level of preparedness that India is ready to fight a pandemic-like exigency if anything like it comes up in the next 50 years, the Union health minister said. "The second wave pointed out the shortages in health infrastructure. But, we don't believe in a blame game. PM Modi has linked health with development and the government under his leadership always made efforts to expand and strengthen health facilities," he said Discussing the Health Infrastructure Mission, Mandaviya said modern laboratories will be set up at the district level which will conduct 115 types of medical tests for the poor citizens free of cost. Critical care units will be set up at the district level equipped with a 100-bed facility that has oxygen and ventilators. Besides, a research centre at the regional level will be set up so that epidemics are recognised on time before they assume pandemic proportions, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/dont-want-to-rush-need-to-tread-with-caution-mandaviya-on-giving-covid-vaccine-to-children/articleshow/87654618.cms||---

He also emphasised the need for greater representation by them in the democratic and political arenas. Sawant, who was speaking at the National Youth Parliament, said the state government is committed to grooming the youth in the best possible way to lead the democracy. He made a case for the establishment of private universities in the state, such as design and skills universities, to offer young people a plethora of courses to choose from. Only the youth can achieve Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s goal pertaining to the New India Mission, Sawant said, and added that his government has been working tirelessly to provide the best possible facilities for the betterment of the youth, including a number of schemes that complement the growth and development of young people in Goa. There is special focus on upgrading technical education, the chief minister said, for which various youth-oriented courses have been introduced in schools and colleges to provide practical experiences that help them develop skills the industry requires.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-cm-calls-for-greater-involvement-of-young-people-in-politics/articleshow/87654555.cms||Murari Shetye

The order came on a day when two terrorists were killed in the valley in two separate encounters. One unidentified terrorist was killed in the first encounter between holed-up terrorists and security forces on Thursday morning at Chawalgam area of South Kashmir’s Kulgam district. Reports said a joint team of police and Army personnel launched a cordon-and-search operation in Chawalgam. As the team approached the spot, the hidden terrorists fired upon the forces, triggering off a gunfight. Another unidentified terrorist was killed in a brief encounter at Bemina area of Srinagar late on Thursday evening. Acting on a specific lead about the presence of terrorists near the Bemina police post, a brief shoot-out took place in which an unidentified terrorist was killed, a police official said. Sources said 50 security pickets were removed from various vulnerable areas across Kashmir valley in 2011, besides release of 600 stone pelters, by the then Omar Abdullah government in consultation with former Union home minister P Chidambaram. Authorities removed five such security pickets from various spots in Srinagar city in February this year in the run up to the visit of the European Union delegation. Two of them were removed from Lal Chowk area. Security agencies have even advised to set up security pickets removed between 2011 and 2014. This necessitated bringing in 5,500 more paramilitary personnel to Kashmir last week. The UPA government in 2010 had appointed a three-member interlocutor team, which recommended the removal of the security pickets. Now, with frequent attacks on civilians and members of minority community since October 2 this year, authorities recently re-built two pickets at Barzulla bridge on the way to the Bone and Joint Hospital in Srinagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/security-pickets-removed-by-upa-to-come-up-again-in-jk/articleshow/87654655.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Addressing the annual executive council meeting of NIM, Uttarkashi, via video conferencing, the union minister said the mountaineering expedition and allied activities do not just signify physical endurance but also mental determination and enthusiasm. "Earlier male dominance was observed in this field but now women participation can also be seen. Divyang friends also participate in mountaineering," he said and referred to Arunima Sinha, who is the world's first woman amputee to scale Mt Everest. "The ethics in mountaineering teach us how to protect nature," he said Singh extended his best wishes to NIM for its next expedition to Manaslu, the eighth-highest mountain in the world at 8,163 metres. "NIM, Uttarkashi was established in 1965. The institute is playing a great role in bringing laurels to the country in the field of mountaineering," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mountaineering-signifies-endurance-mental-determination-says-rajnath-singh/articleshow/87654763.cms||---
---||World||Covid-19 hot spots offer sign of what could be ahead for US||The contagious delta variant is driving up Covid-19 hospitalizations in the Mountain West and fueling disruptive outbreaks in the North, a worrisome sign of what could be ahead this winter in the US While trends are improving in Florida, Texas and other Southern states that bore the worst of the summer surge, it’s clear that delta isn’t done with the United States. Covid-19 is moving north and west for the winter as people head indoors, close their windows and breathe stagnant air. “We’re going to see a lot of outbreaks in unvaccinated people that will result in serious illness, and it will be tragic,” said Dr. Donald Milton of the University of Maryland School of Public Health. In recent days, a Vermont college suspended social gatherings after a spike in cases tied to Halloween parties. Boston officials shut down an elementary school to control an outbreak. Hospitals in New Mexico and Colorado are overwhelmed. In Michigan, the three-county metro Detroit area is again becoming a hot spot for transmissions, with nearly 400 Covid-19 patients in hospitals. Mask-wearing in Michigan has declined to about 25% of people, according to a combination of surveys tracked by an influential modeling group at the University of Washington. “Concern over Covid in general is pretty much gone, which is unfortunate,” said Dr. Jennifer Morse, medical director at health departments in 20 central and northern Michigan counties. “I feel strange going into a store masked. I’m a minority. It’s very different. It’s just a really unusual atmosphere right now.” New Mexico is running out of intensive care beds despite the state’s above-average vaccination rate. Waning immunity may be playing a role. People who were vaccinated early and have not yet received booster shots may be driving up infection numbers, even if they still have some protection from the most dire consequences of the virus. “Delta and waning immunity — the combination of these two have set us back,” said Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington. “This virus is going to stick with us for a long, long time.” The delta variant dominates infections across the US., accounting for more than 99% of the samples analyzed. No state has achieved a high enough vaccination rate, even when combined with infection-induced immunity, to avoid the type of outbreaks happening now, Mokdad said. In a deviation from national recommendations, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed an executive order Thursday that allows any resident 18 or older access to a Covid-19 booster shot, another step to prevent hospitals and health care workers from being overwhelmed by the state’s surge in delta infections. Progress on vaccination continues, yet nearly 60 million Americans age 12 and older remain unvaccinated. That’s an improvement since July, when 100 million were unvaccinated, said White House Covid-19 coordinator Jeff Zients. First shots are averaging about 300,000 per day, and the effort to vaccinate children ages 5 to 11 is off to a strong start, Zients said at a briefing Wednesday. Virginia Tech’s Linsey Marr, a leading researcher on the airborne spread of the coronavirus, predicted the northward spread of the virus in a Twitter post September 15. The virus spreads in the air and can build up in enclosed rooms with poor ventilation. Colder weather means more people are indoors breathing the same air, Marr said. Imagine that everyone you spend time with is a smoker and you want to breathe as little of their smoke as possible, she said. “The closer you are to a smoker the more exposure you have to that smoke,” Marr said. “And if you’re in a poorly ventilated room, the smoke builds up over time.” Marr said she and her vaccinated family will use rapid tests before gathering for Christmas to check for infection. “It’s hard to know what’s coming next with this virus,” Marr said. “We thought we knew, but delta really surprised us. We thought the vaccine would help end this, but things are still dragging on. It’s hard to know what’s going to happen next.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/covid-19-hot-spots-offer-sign-of-what-could-be-ahead-for-us/articleshow/87654812.cms||---

---||Delhi||Had a bad haircut, brow cut, wax burn? Delhiites say, ‘You are not alone’||How many times have you been on the verge of a meltdown after a trip to the salon or walked out less than pleased with the service? While most of us may choose to not react even when we want to scream in anger because the stylist has either cut our hair too short, or left a bald spot on our eyebrow, a salon was recently told to pay Rs 2 crore to a model as a punitive award for a haircut that allegedly wasn’t what she had hoped for. The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) awarded this sum to her for a wrong haircut at a salon in a five-star hotel in Delhi in April 2018. The order noted, “According to the complainant, she specifically instructed the hairdresser for long flicks/layers covering her face in the front and at the back and four-inch straight hair trim from the bottom.” The complainant was left in “utter shock and surprise”, when the hairdresser allegedly “chopped off her entire hair, leaving only four inches from the top”. While this may seem like a rare case when a client was awarded this sum for a service gone wrong, such salon experiences are quite common. ‘Such mishaps are common, irrespective of the gender’Parul Sharma, a psychology student, shares, “I went to a luxury salon where I had asked the hairdresser to give me light bangs but he kept on chopping my hair and the final outcome was nothing close to what I had wanted. It ended up looking like Sadhna cut. It was looking terrible and it was my cousin’s wedding. It was so traumatic, I don’t have a single picture from that wedding.” Sharing about her another experience when she went for hair smoothening, but got her hair burnt, Parul says, “The hairdresser used such harsh chemicals that it burnt my hair. He told me that it happened because my hair was already coloured. He even asked me to come for another treatment after three months. And to compensate for it, he offered to give me a hair spa.” Kaustubh Sankhyadhar, a resident of East of Kailash, shares, “I was going for my first international trip three years ago, so I went for a haircut. I wanted a hairstyle like Virat Kohli with three lines on one side, so the hairdresser ended up using the trimmer, and there was no hair left on that side. So, while one side had hair and the other was bald. I had thought of cancelling the trip because it was awful. I told them that it was not about money, it was about my hair. I had to go fully bald after that.” Salon-goers tell us that a good rappot with the hairdresser in important to prevent bad haircutsNot just hair mishaps, there are wax burns, eyebrow cuts, too!Sharing her experience of eyebrow mishap, Radhika Bajaj, a resident of Subhash Nagar, says, “I had recently gone to my cousin’s place in South Extension, and we decided to go out for dinner that night. There was no need for me to get my eyebrows done, still I thought that it would look clean if I could get some extra growth removed. I went to a salon nearby, where the beautician ended up making a cut right in the middle of it. When I saw myself in the mirror and asked her, all she said was that she did not realise that it would look that bad. She thought she was only removing the extras, but in reality, she ended up leaving a cut. I had to wait for weeks for that cut to get better. Now I don’t let anyone touch my eyebrows, except one expert who has been doing it for years now.” Ragini Bansal, a resident of Saket, adds, “I only trust salons with experienced staff. I remember about six years ago, I had gone to a salon and they told me that a new staff member would do my waxing. It was all fine till she waxed my arms. When she started waxing my left leg, she ended up burning it with hot wax. She wanted to spread it but she took it more than what was needed, and before she could do anything about it, it was all over me. There was a burn on my leg, which stayed for almost three weeks. I have stopped waxing my legs since then and have switched to shaving after that incident.” Salon-goers tell us that your rapport with your beautician or grooming expert is very important to avoid mishaps like wax burns ‘Asked for hair trimming, was left with no hair to even tie my hair in a ponytail’If you think going to a popular salon might save you from mishaps, you are mistaken. Devika Gupta, a resident of Patel Nagar, doesn’t let anyone touch her hair except her hairstylist. She says, “If he is not on duty when I want a trim or haircut, then I don’t get the services done on the same day.” Shibani Chand Sethi, a resident of Sector 65, Gurgaon, who also takes up modelling assignments part-time, adds that she was facing hair fall after suffering from COVID, so she only wanted to get her edges trimmed, but the hairdresser ended up giving her an uneven haircut instead. “I had mid-length hair and because of the hair fall, I only wanted to get the edges trimmed, but the hairstylist shortened it till my ear, and that too, unevenly. He messed it up totally. I walked out being disappointed, but I did not say anything to him. I read a poster that read, ‘Women are emotional about their hair but we react when something shocking and unexpected like this happens to us,’” she says. Shivani Kumar, a resident of Sector 6, Dwarka, who went to a popular salon to get her split ends fixed, shares, “I had told the hairdresser specifically that I only wanted to get my hair trimmed, but after he was done, I noticed that I had no hair left to even tie my hair properly in a ponytail. When I asked him about my length, he said, ‘Ma’am, aap ke saare baal damaged thay.”’ Read AlsoAs Delhi's air turns toxic, doctors say N95 better than cloth masks to combat pollution + COVIDDelhi’s air quality severely dipped post Diwali, with many areas in the city recording an Air Quality Index (AQI) over 500.

---||India||Covid-19: Policy on booster shot soon, says panel member||HYDERABAD: India will soon release a policy document on administering a booster dose (third dose) of Covid-19 vaccine, a key member of the country’s Covid task force said on Thursday. Dr NK Arora, co-chair of INSACOG, a 28-lab consortium set up to monitor genomic variations in SARS-CoV-2, urged people not to take a booster dose right now as it won’t be considered for any certification. “We have been working on the policy document for the past three weeks, and firming it up. It will be made public soon,” Arora said. At the TimesNow Summit in Delhi, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said that it is natural to discuss the need for booster shots but the government would take a decision based on expert opinion. “Our objective is to first administer both the first dose and second dose to the entire eligible population. I do not think that in such matters (booster dose), the government will take any direct decisions... we will depend on whatever recommendations are given by ICMR and expert teams. We will deliberate the issue only after expert suggestions are received,” Mandaviya said. He added that the country has adequate doses available and, therefore, any future requirement can be met. The document, which is likely to be out in another 10 days, will spell out the government’s plans on rolling out a third dose and those eligible to get it first. “We are manufacturing 30-35 crore doses every month. We don’t have any shortage of vaccines, but that doesn’t mean you administer them without reason. There is a lot of scientific thought going into the document,” Arora said. Warning people not to go in for a third dose as yet, he said all seropositive studies across the country have shown vaccines administered so far have worked well, and there are no major outbreaks that should prompt panic and a rush for a secret vaccination. “There will be no record of this third dose that people take secretly,” Arora told TOI. Read AlsoCovaxin well tolerated, phase 3 data shows 77.8% efficacy against symptomatic Covid: LancetA week after the World Health Organisation (WHO) granted Emergency Use Listing (EUL) to Covaxin, a prestigious medical journal Lancet has stated that the phase 3 data of India’s first indigenously developed vaccine demonstrates 77.8% efficacy against symptomatic Covid-19. Its efficacy data alsoArora’s comment comes at a time when various officials, including Telangana health authorities, have openly advocated a third dose, saying people low on immunity should take a booster shot. “There is no such arrangement in CoWin. And you will not get a certificate. Moreover, there is no outbreak, and there are no major concerns as cases are coming down. We are in a better situation than many other countries,” Arora said. Read AlsoNumber of people still to take second vaccine shot climbs to 12 crore, says health minister Mansukh MandaviyaOver 12 crore people are due for their second dose of Covid vaccine in India, health minister Mansukh Mandaviya pointed out as he urged states to make a collective effort to ensure no citizen is left without vaccine protection. The number of people overdue for the second dose has risen as Dr V KSo far, seropositive studies across India have shown that the vaccination drive has had a positive impact, with at least 85% of India’s eligible beneficiaries receiving at least one dose. “In Delhi, 97% of the population is seropositive. In UP, the figure is 88% and in Telangana 85%. The vaccination drive is in full swing,” Arora said, adding that the vaccine tracker shows that even those who have got only the first dose are protected from death. He said India’s plan to bridge the gap between two doses of Covishield has gone a long way in ensuring protection. “We are now reaping the benefits. Antibody levels among Indians are higher than (in) others,” he said. After Dussehra, barring some cases in West Bengal, Assam and Himachal Pradesh, there has been no cause for concern. “Dussehra is celebrated everywhere.

---||India||Covaxin well tolerated, phase 3 data shows 77.8% efficacy against symptomatic Covid: Lancet||HYDERABAD: A week after the World Health Organisation (WHO) granted Emergency Use Listing (EUL) to Covaxin, a prestigious medical journal Lancet has stated that the phase 3 data of India’s first indigenously developed vaccine demonstrates 77.8% efficacy against symptomatic Covid-19. Its efficacy data also demonstrates 70.8% protection against all variants of SARS-CoV-2. Covaxin’s efficacy was arrived at through the evaluation of 130 confirmed cases, of which 24 were observed in the vaccine group and 106 cases were in the placebo group. The two-dose inactivated virus vaccine was developed from scratch in India by Bharat Biotech along with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Institute of Virology (NIV) Pune. The efficacy analysis showed Covaxin (BBV152) is 93.4% effective against severe symptomatic Covid-19 and offers 63.6% protection against asymptomatic Covid-19. It is also 65.2% effective against the Delta variant, 90.1% effective against the Kappa variant, Lancet said. “BBV152 was well tolerated; the same proportion of participants reported adverse events in the vaccine group [1597 out of 12879 (12.4%)] and placebo group [1597 of 12874 (12.4%)] with no clinically significant differences in the distributions of solicited, unsolicited, or serious adverse events between the groups, and no cases of anaphylaxis or vaccine-related deaths,” the peer-reviewed journal observed. Covaxin safety analysis demonstrates that the adverse events reported were similar to placebo, with 12% of the subjects experiencing commonly known side effects and less than 0.5% of subjects experiencing serious adverse events, Bharat Biotech said, adding: “Covaxin was well tolerated and the Data Safety Monitoring Board has not reported any safety concerns related to the vaccine. The overall rate of adverse events observed in Covaxin was lower than that seen in Covid-19 vaccines. The safety profile of Covaxin is now well established”. In a separate comment in The Lancet, Chinese experts Jing-Xin Li and Feng-Cai Zhu of the Nanjing-based Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention pointed out that with the Delta variant outcompeting all SARS-CoV-2 variants as the most predominant variant of concern globally, with substantially higher transmissibility than other VOCs, the BBV152 Phase 3 results reported by Raches Ella and colleagues were a “welcome advance”. “…in a phase 3 trial of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BBV152) based on an Asp614Gly variant, the authors found a substantial reduction in symptomatic Covid-19... In the study by Ella and colleagues, in all the delta-positive cases, the viral load in vaccine recipients was significantly lower than in placebo recipients,” they said while pointing to the reduced vaccine effectiveness being reported in real-world studies of other vaccines like the ones developed by Pfizer and AstraZeneca. Though Li & Zhu observed that the BBV152 study cohort was less ethnically diverse as only Indian participants were involved, they said: “the study provides evidence of protection against asymptomatic infection that might be of public health significance, which has not been reported in previous trials of other SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.” “Generally, the apparent protection against severe Covid-19 is most crucial, but the capability of preventing asymptomatic infection would also protect against mild disease, transmission, and eventually might lead to a reduction in subsequent cases of severe Covid-19,” the Chinese experts said. Zhu and Li also said that the roll-out of the vaccine might ease the ultra-cold chain requirements of other SARS-CoV-2 vaccine platforms, increase the finite global manufacturing capacity, and improve the insufficient supply of vaccines which disproportionately affects low-income and middle-income countries. Meanwhile, Bharat Biotech said Lancet peer-review confirms the efficacy analysis that demonstrates Covaxin to be effective against Covid-19 and that Covaxin is the only Covid-19 vaccine to have demonstrated efficacy data from phase III clinical trials against the Delta variant at 65.2%. “The peer-review of Covaxin phase III clinical trial data in The Lancet, an authoritative voice in global medicine, validates our commitment to data transparency and meeting the stringent peer-review standards of world-leading medical journals,” said Bharat Biotech chairman & managing director Dr Krishna Ella. He said with this, data from Covaxin’s product development and clinical trials have been published in 10 peer-reviewed journals, making Covaxin one of the most highly published Covid-19 vaccines in the world. Terming the partnership between Bharat Biotech, ICMR and NIV as one of the most successful public-private partnerships, ICMR director-general Dr Balram Bhargava said the publication of the efficacy data in Lancet speaks highly about the strong position of Covaxin among the global front-runner Covid-19 vaccines. “The bench to bedside journey of Covaxin in less than 10 months showcases the immense strength of `Atmanirbhar Bharat’ along with the Indian academia and industry in fighting against the odds and carving a niche in the global community,” Bhargava said. The Phase III efficacy and safety study involved around 25,800 volunteers across 25 sites in India. So far, over 150 million doses of Covaxin have been manufactured and supplied and it is now being evaluated in controlled clinical trials in children aged 2-18 years. The company has submitted data of the children's trials to the Indian drug regulator and its partner Ocugen has applied to the US Food & Drug Administration (USFDA) for emergency use authorisation for paediatric use of Covaxin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covaxin-well-tolerated-phase-3-data-shows-77-8-efficacy-against-symptomatic-covid-lancet/articleshow/87655618.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

The Chinese are building these villages possibly for billeting and locating their civilians and soldiers in the future, particularly after the recent face-offs we have had,” he said. “But this present controversy that has erupted that Chinese have come across into our territory and built a new village is not true,” he added, speaking at the Times Now summit here. China is building border infrastructure and these so-called villages "well within their side" of the LAC. “They have not transgressed anywhere on our perception of the LAC. There are different perceptions. We are very clear where the LAC lines…The Chinese have a perception, which in some areas we know and in other areas we don’t. As far as we are concerned, there is no such village development that has taken place on our side of the LAC,” said Gen Rawat. As earlier reported by TOI, China has built the new large 100-home village on disputed territory in the Upper Subansiri district of Arunachal Pradesh in violation of bilateral agreements. While the area is claimed by India, it has been under China’s “adverse occupation” since 1959.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/china-villages-are-on-their-side-chief-of-defence-staff-general-bipin-rawat/articleshow/87655806.cms||---

Responding to questions about reports of construction of Chinese “dual-use” villages in the border areas, particularly in Arunachal Pradesh, MEA spokesperson, Arindam Bagchi told journalists on Thursday that India has “conveyed its strong protest to such activities through diplomatic means and will continue to do so in the future.” China, he said, has “undertaken construction activities in the past several years along the border areas, including in the areas that it has illegally occupied over the decades.

The Indian defence establishment has been trying to downplay the issue. In background responses to journalists, defence officials have said these villages have been under Chinese control since 1959. “The village has been built by China in an area that was occupied by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) after overrunning an Assam Rifles post in 1959, in an operation known as Longju incident along the frontier in Arunachal Pradesh,” they were quoted as saying.

The number of people overdue for the second dose has risen as Dr V K Paul, member health in Niti Aayog and a key expert in the vaccination programme, had on October 20 said that the number of persons who had overshot the date for the second dose stood at 10 crore. Read AlsoCovid-19: Policy on booster shot soon, says panel memberDr NK Arora, co-chair of INSACOG, a 28-lab consortium set up to monitor genomic variations in SARS-CoV-2, urged people not to take a booster dose right now as it won’t be considered for any certification. “We have been working on the policy document for the past three weeks, and firming it up. ItIn a meeting with state health ministers to push the door-to-door vaccination campaign, the Centre suggested several measures such as creation of multiple vaccination teams (50-100) to ensure 100% coverage in the targeted area in a time-bound manner; development of a ranking mechanism for identifying and felicitating the vaccination teams (district and block) which administer the maximum number of vaccine doses every 24 hours, and utilising local weekly bazaars and haats for spreading awareness. “Let us ensure collectively through collaborative and multi-stakeholder efforts that no eligible citizen is left without the vaccine’s ‘Suraksha Kawachh’. Let us reach each corner and household and motivate people to take both the doses,” Mandaviya said while interacting with health ministers of states and UTs.

Spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid also assured that as per the “policy of Islamic Emirates of Afghanistan”, its land will not be used against any country and that Taliban want mutual cooperation. “Though we are not present in this conference, we firmly believe that this conference is in the better interest of Afghanistan as the entire region is considerate of the current Afghan situation and the participating countries also must be thoughtful of improving and safeguarding the security situation in Afghanistan and helping the current government to ensure security in the country on its own,” said Mujahid, adding Taliban didn’t have any anxiety about India’s conference. He expressed hope the outcome will be “utilised and implemented”. A day after the conference, the Indian government said while it is committed to providing humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan, the situation on the ground remained difficult because of a lack of unimpeded access for aid to the country. India is still awaiting Pakistan's approval for transporting wheat to Afghanistan by road. “India’s support to the people of Afghanistan is very clear. We have been extending support over many years to all the people of Afghanistan. The situation on the ground has become very difficult over the last few months,” said MEA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/want-good-diplomatic-ties-with-india-taliban/articleshow/87655835.cms||---

Since the matter is sub judice, the detailed information about his dismissal will be given to the court,” principal secretary of medical education Alok Kumar said. Responding to the move on social media, Khan said he would challenge the order in the court once he received it. “Sixty-three kids died because the government did not pay Rs 68 lakh to the oxygen-supplying firm. Eight people were suspended in this case, seven of whom have been reinstated. I got a clean chit from inquiries conducted by different officials — from the DM to the principal secretary...Even the HC held that there was not a single piece of evidence against me to establish negligence or corruption. Still, I have been terminated.” Khan had been suspended over the crib deaths along with seven others on August 22, 2017. He was subsequently jailed for nine months on charges of medical negligence, corruption and dereliction of duty. While under suspension, Khan was attached to the office of the director general of medical education, but trouble continued to stalk him. On July 31, 2019, the government suspended the paediatrician again for allegedly treating patients forcibly at a hospital in Bahraich district the previous year. The doctor, who had by then moved the Allahabad HC against his first suspension, challenged this order, too, arguing that since he was already under suspension in the BRD case, there was no point in issuing a similar order. The HC stayed the government’s order to suspend Khan for the second time this September. An inquiry committee had absolved Khan of the charge of medical negligence leading to the 2017 crib deaths. Although the main charge was dismissed, the probe report held Khan guilty of private practice till August 2016. A disciplinary panel partially accepted the findings, but contested the probe report in respect of two charges against Khan. On February 24 last year, the panel asked for further inquiry into the case. Khan challenged this order, too, in the high court. In its order on July 29 this year, the court said, “The delay in taking further action on the part of the disciplinary authority is not explained. The respondents are also obliged to justify the continuance of the order of suspension which has continued for more than four years.” On August 6, the state government submitted in court that it was withdrawing the additional inquiry against Khan. Additional advocate general Manish Goyal also said “all endeavour would be made to conclude the disciplinary proceedings against Dr Kafeel Khan within a period of three months”. The medical education department issued the termination order just after the completion of the three-month period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/four-years-after-crib-deaths-up-sacks-kafeel-for-laxity/articleshow/87655986.cms||---

Telecom and IT minister Ashwani Vaishnaw said that while the auctions may be delayed by a few months against the originally-envisaged targets, the plan is to roll out an attractive policy that will see companies ride over the recent reform package and plan new investments after the spectrum sale. Speaking at the Times Now Summit 2021, the minister said that regulator Trai is undertaking consultations with regards to the upcoming auctions, including for 5G airwaves. “I think they will submit their report by February-mid, is what we are thinking, may be February-end, maximum to maximum March. Immediately after that, we will have the auctions.” On final timelines of the auctions, he said, “Today, our estimate is by April-May. I was earlier estimating March. But, I think it will take time… because consultations are complex, diverse opinions are coming.” The government feels that the bailout package given in March will enable companies to have greater cash in hand that will not only help them invest higher in networks, but also plan liberally for the auctions. The government relief package had included removal of non-telecom revenues from the AGR definition, increasing tenure of spectrum holdings from 20 years to 30 years, no spectrum usage charges for new auctions, 100% FDI through the automatic route.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/government-plans-5g-sale-in-early-next-fiscal/articleshow/87656031.cms||Pankaj Doval
---||India||India, 21 other nations protest against ‘carbon colonisation’||GLASGOW: With COP26 heading for final day without taking definite call on key issues including climate finance and market-based mechanism for carbon reduction (carbon market), a climate negotiation group of 22 countries including India and China - known as Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) - on Thursday called the Conference presidency not to adopt "mitigation centric approach" by keeping 1.5 degree Celsius goal alive as a "collective responsibility" of all nations in the Glasgow decision text, and requested him to "completely remove paragraph on mitigation" in the revised text. The paragraph on mitigation in the text, which is to be finalised only after consensus, includes language on collectively trying to limit global warming to 1.5 degree C above pre-industrial level (1850-1900), as opposed to the target under the Paris Agreement which put 2 degree C as upper limit while keeping 1.5 degree C as merely an aspirational goal. The text also asked for commitments from 196 countries to boost their climate targets by 2023 to keep the warming limit goal of 1.5 degree Celsius alive and to submit by next year their long term decarbonisation strategies to be on a promised net-zero trajectory. The LMDC group including India, China, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bolivia and Indonesia, however, strongly objected to it and termed the move as 'carbon colonialism'. "Developed countries are pushing this narrative of 1.5 degrees Celsius very hard. We know that this narrative will lead them to control the world once again. And those countries that are not able to achieve the net zero targets by 2050, they will be ethically and financially condemned. That is unfair. That is against climate justice," said Diego Pacheco, Bolivia's lead negotiator, who represents the LMDC group. Speaking on behalf of the group at a press conference, he said, "We request developed countries to achieve real reduction of emissions immediately and by 2030, within this decade. They cannot take targets very distant in the future...We as LMDC do not accept that this COP will be a scenario for transferring historical responsibility to the developing countries". The LMDC members also expressed the need for higher mobilisation of finance from the developed countries instead of trying to change the narrative towards mitigation and 2050 'net zero' goal which, the group thinks, is against the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibility (CBDR) and respective capabilities (RC) as enshrined in the UN Convention and the Paris Agreement. "We are not going to accept any changes in the principle of CBDR. There should be differentiation. There should be recognition for CBDR in the negotiation process. And there should also be recognition of the pre-2020 ambition gap. So, if we are going to accept net zero by 2050 for all countries then the developing countries would be trapped in a very unjust way of addressing climate change," said Pacheco. The group noted that if it accepts the text on mitigation in the current form, the developing countries will be trapped in that narrative because they will never be able to achieve the targets that the Presidency is setting for the entire world as the Glasgow decision. "We need to fight the developed world against this carbon colonialism. It is very risky for our countries and completely ignores that there are historical responsibilities," said the Bolivian negotiator. The LMDC, meanwhile, appreciated the US and China deal even if it may add a new dynamic into the talks, raising questions over China's role in the BASIC and LMDC alliances as many believe that Beijing extracted nothing for developing nations from the US unlike India which has consistently been raising the issue of climate finance for the entire developing world. Appreciating the US-China deal, Pacheco said the LMDC welcomed all the arrangements in order to improve national efforts to increase ambition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-21-other-nations-protest-against-carbon-colonisation/articleshow/87655949.cms||Vishwa Mohan

Speaking at the Times Now Summit 2021, he said that the government will provide infrastructure, manpower, laboratory facilities, and information needed by the committee to complete its probe. On social media regulations, the minister said that while internet giants have given people a chance to express themselves freely, at the same time, misuse of technology has placed “a huge burden of thinking” on where should the regulation be. The minister said that there has to a balance between privacy and social responsibility. “I would say, our policy will have to have our cultural roots, our needs, our realities in focus when we do the policy,” he said, adding that the element of “trust” has to come in social media. The government’s approach is not to censor but to enable self-regulation while empowering users of social media. “There has to be first, an element of self-regulation. Self-regulation is the first step, second is the users themselves come out and regulate. The third is the government should step in. So, the way we have structured our social media and intermediary rules, basically puts the consumer in the front,” he said. On the issue of alleged use of Israeli spyware Pegasus for targeted surveillance in India, Vaishnaw said the government “fully respects” the Supreme Court’s direction. The committee formed by the Supreme Court has “stellar technical experts”, he said, adding that the government will provide complete cooperation to this committee in terms of infrastructure, manpower, laboratory facilities, and in terms of information that is needed. “We are absolutely clean on this, so we don’t have to worry about what is going to come out of this report,” he said. To a question on whether no government agency ever bought Pegasus, Vaishnaw said, “I had very categorically said in Parliament that whatever we are doing, is exactly within the framework of the law. And the law of the land has been clearly laid down by SC guidelines. Absolutely, we are within those four walls of the law.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/were-absolutely-clean-on-pegasus-will-cooperate-with-sc-panel-it-and-communications-minister-ashwini-vaishnaw/articleshow/87656133.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: No end to slugfest over bitcoin scam||BENGALURU: The BJP and Congress continued to point fingers at each other in the bitcoin scam. Soon after chief minister Basavaraj Bommai met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi on Thursday, state Congress president DK Shivakumar wondered why Bommai wanted to brief the PM about it. Instead, he said, the chief minister should place before people all case facts including the money trail and whether there had been money laundering. He said the chief minister was trying to ruin the image of Congress leaders by making accusations. Shivakumar accused the CM and BJP leaders of trying to mislead people “We won’t allow them to succeed. We have certain information and will disclose it at an appropriate time,” he said. Former CM HD Kumaraswamy alleged that thousands of crores of rupees were withdrawn from Jan Dhan accounts by hackers which is why the PMO seems to have taken the bitcoin scam seriously. He also wanted to know how Srikrishna Ramesh alias Sriki, a hacker and alleged kingpin of the scam, got bail so easily and asked who had provided him surety. Sriki was arrested in a drug case. Home minister Araga Jnanendra asked Congress leaders to provide information and evidence to investigating authorities instead of indulging in “hit-and-run allegations”. Countering Congress MLA Priyank Kharge who had alleged that the scam would cost Bommai his job, Mysuru BJP MP Pratap Simha said the scam would engulf Congress leaders. “Investigation will prove who is involved. Already names of kith and kin of Congress leaders have surfaced and that’s why they’re attacking the BJP,” he said. The chief minister's office described the PM's response in the Thursday meeting as tacit endorsement of Bommai's leadership and the party’s backing. Bommai had earlier said he didn’t offer any explanation to home minister Amit Shah but discussed it with party national president JP Nadda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/no-end-to-slugfest-over-bitcoin-scam/articleshow/87656158.cms||---

It rejected a petition filed by Traegen Systems Private Limited, a Bengaluru-based MSME in the business of musical instruments, audio equipment and allied things.The petitioner had challenged the October 1, 2020 communication issued by South Indian Bank Limited, refusing its request for financial assistance under the Credit Guarantee Scheme for subordinate debt.Declining to interfere in the matter, Justice Krishna S Dixit pointed out though good bankers will not dodge their responsibility to lend to creditworthy regular customers, whether large or small, at the same time, banking needs to be run with great caution.“While adventure to a certain extent may be necessary for other kinds of business like industry and commerce, reckless speculation and greedy eyeing of profits by compromising safety of public funds are shunned by prudent bankers all over the world,” the judge said.“There is a kind of dynamic tension between the forces impelling the progressive activities of banks and the compelling need for prudent conduct of banking business. In considering the petitioner’s claim of the kind, the respondent-bank cannot be asked to keep its commercial prudence in cold storage; it is more so when the balance sheet of the borrower does not reflect a healthy picture,” the judge added. Recalling the slogan, “Husband your banking resources”, that American economist Robert C Holland had given to bankers, the judge said it becomes relevant nowadays when about two dozen public sector banks have been closed down or merged with other banks due to unscrupulous lending and other reasons.“A little less than a century ago, Bombay Provincial Banking Enquiry Committee (1929-30) had famously observed, ‘Banking is my brains and other people’s money’,” Justice Dixit noted. It has been pointed out in the order that the petitioner-company (sanction letters dated December 11, 2014 and October 7, 2016) had availed term loans of Rs 5 lakh and Rs 30 kakh, respectively; subsequently, it had taken a cash credit open loan of Rs 2 crore (sanction letter dated September 07, 2017.)In addition, the two guarantors who are co-petitioners, also availed a mortgage loan of Rs 97 lakh (sanction letter dated March 26, 2019) and the bank on January 31, 2020 classified all loan accounts as NPA and initiated proceedings for recovery of Rs 2.5 crore as on September 2, 2020. However, Justice Dixit said this judgment will not come in the way of the bank reconsidering its decision if the petitioners come forward with a viable proposal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-customers-benefit-cant-outweigh-public-trust-in-banks/articleshow/87656161.cms||Vasantha Kumar

Things came to a head on November 6 when six two-wheelers parked near Jain College area were loaded on to a towing truck in a jiffy in Jayanagar 9th Block. There was no board on the wide road announcing that it was a no-parking zone. The residents said the SoP stipulated that towing staff must turn on a siren before towing any vehicle in a signal to the owner. If there is no response, they can tow the vehicle and if the owner turns up, police can collect only the violation fee prescribed for parking the vehicle at the no-parking area. “How can women and senior citizens run behind these cops? If the rules are violated by us, late them take action. Why unnecessary trouble us?” said Lakshmi K, a resident of Jayanagar. Soon, a crowd gathered against the unauthorised towing. The assistant sub-inspector (ASI) of jurisdictional Mico Layout traffic police rushed to spot, faced a volley of questions from the angry residents, apologised and released the vehicles. A video of the residents arguing with police went viral on Tuesday. “Recently, home minister Araga Jnanendra too directed traffic police to strictly adhere to towing rules while lifting vehicles from no-parking areas in the city, giving no room for any complaint of harassment from the public. But what are these people doing?” said Subramanya, another resident. ‘Can’t take away vehicles in parking zones’“We have a proper SoP for towing vehicles and when it is violated, we will take necessary action against our officers. When a vehicle is in a parking zone, officers and towing staff cannot tow it,” said KM Shantaraju, DCP east (traffic).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/towing-of-vehicles-leaves-jayanagar-residents-fuming/articleshow/87656166.cms||---

The accused are HV Ajay Kumar alias Mohan, 41, of Avalahalli; Jnanamurthy R, 42, of Yelahanka; BK Ravichandra, 36, of Harohalli near Anugondanahalli; Murugesh S, 27, of Bairasandra near Malur; Muniraju G, 33, of Kudiyanur and Kumaraswamy R, 38, of Agrahara near Yelahanka. Hoskote police have registered a case of cheating, robbery and criminal conspiracy against the gang based on a complaint filed by the victim, Gopala Mallappa Kambale, 26, a resident of Nivaragi village in Vijayapura district on October 10. Kambale told police that he met the main accused Shivakumar four years ago in Goa and they exchanged phone numbers. Shivakumar recently assured Kambale that he would get him a government job if the latter arranges Rs 10 lakh. Kambale arranged the cash and came to Hoskote with his friend Mahesh on October 8, to give the money to Shivakumar. “I came to Hoskote and called Shivakumar. He asked me to meet his friend Mohan, who could take me to the office concerned. Mohan sent a car, which picked us up from near Hoskote government hospital, where I was told to wait. Two people wearing caps and wielding lathis and a walkie-talkie intercepted our car and boarded it. The driver told me they are policemen. Within a few minutes, the duo snatched my bag containing cash and dumped us near Devanagundi Cross before speeding away,” Kambale alleged. Hoskote police inspector SR Manjunath and his team launched a probe and traced Mohan and his gang members. Police arrested the six miscreants and recovered Rs 7 lakh, two cars, walkie-talkie, caps, lathis and six mobile phones from them. Efforts are on to nab main suspect Shivakumar. With these arrests, police also solved another cheating case registered in Sarjapur against the same gang on October 5. The gang lured Mysuru resident Naveen, a realtor, on the pretext of selling him land at a lower price in Sarjapur area. Naveen had visited Sarjapur to see the land when the gang robbed him of Rs 4 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/6-held-for-robbing-govt-job-aspirant-realtor/articleshow/87656172.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Tenders floated for 62,000 saplings, BBMP ready to pay Rs 930 for each||BENGALURU: BBMP recently floated tenders for planting and managing about 62,500 saplings across the city at an estimated cost of nearly Rs 930 each, raising eyebrows of not only conservationists but even forest department officials. The short-term tenders were floated on October 29, 2021 and are estimated to be worth Rs 5.8 crore in total. There are 21 tenders in all, each for planting 2,500 to 3,500 saplings, covering the eight zones of BBMP. The technical bids will be opened on November 17 and financial on November 24. The tenders envisage planting mahogany, neem and Indian Beech (Honge) and some fruit trees. “These trees are not exotic and the cost of one sapling is in the range of Rs 3 to Rs 500 depending on its age and condition, at BBMP’s nurseries. The tender estimates are exorbitant,” Vijay Nishanth, a conservationist alleged. “They spend money on saplings but forget to maintain them. On many occasions, tree guards are stolen and the saplings die without proper manure and due to other reasons. This is unnecessary,” said Nishanth. Endorsing the conservationist’s view, a top forest department official said, “The tender price for the saplings is very high. If they are planting sandalwood, teak, rosewood or other expensive exotic plants, it is possible to incur such high costs but that is not the case here.” The official found the timing of the short-term tenders odd, pointing out that if the saplings are planted in December their survival chances are zero. “If the pits are dug in December and saplings planted, their chances of surviving the winter are very poor. If they are sowed towards the end of summer, their chances of surviving are very high as rain supports them,” the official explained. ‘Miscellaneous expenses’BBMP’s deputy conservator of forests (DCF), Govindaraju V, however, denied that the tenders are exorbitantly priced. “These tenders include maintenance of the saplings, watering them, constructing tree guards and other miscellaneous expenses,” he said, adding, however, that the saplings would be provided from the Palike’s nurseries. Sources privy to the developments in BBMP reveal that similar tenders floated earlier were scrapped due to paucity of funds. “These tenders were floated to favour certain contractors. Though that is the case with most BBMP tenders, the cost is just unacceptable,” they said. BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta said that contractors would be held responsible if the plantation drive fails.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/tenders-floated-for-62k-saplings-bbmp-ready-to-pay-930-for-each/articleshow/87656178.cms||Nithya Mandyam
---||India||Salman Khurshid’s comparison of Hindutva with jihadist Islam wrong, says Ghulam Nabi Azad||NEW DELHI: As BJP attacked Congress leader Salman Khurshid accusing him of comparing Hindutva with jihadi organisations, Congress veteran Ghulam Nabi Azad weighed in on the controversy by red-flagging colleague Khurshid for “factually wrong” comparison. Azad said, “We may not agree with Hindutva as a political ideology distinct from the composite culture of Hinduism, but comparing it with ISIS and jihadist Islam is factually wrong and exaggeration.” The alleged comparison is from the book by former law minister Khurshid “Sunrise over Ayodhya: Nationhood in our Times” which was released at a function on Wednesday. The book is about the Ayodhya judgement of the Supreme Court which Khurshid has lauded. Azad’s decision to distance himself from Khurshid is interesting given that both have been long-standing colleagues in the party as well as in the central governments. But it may also indicate the discomfort in certain ranks of the party given that such controversies feed the rival BJP’s campaign to paint Congress as “anti Hindu”. When asked about Azad’s statement, Khurshid said, “Azad is an experienced person. His statement is carefully noted.” He said there was not much difference between him and Azad in the stance they have taken. “He has also said that he disagrees with that ideology while I have explained why we disagree with it. That’s all,” Khurshid said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/salman-khurshids-comparison-of-hindutva-with-jihadist-islam-wrong-says-ghulam-nabi-azad/articleshow/87656179.cms||---

We do not want to rush in administering vaccines to children. Children are the future of our country. The government will take expert opinion and go by it,” Mandaviya said, underlining that other countries have also been careful in introducing the jabs for children even though emergency use authorisation has been granted. The minister’s remarks indicate that the decision on vaccination for children is not round the corner. Government has noted that the high prevalence of antibodies detected in adults in sero surveys conducted by the Centre and the states are also reflected in children who have not been vaccinated. This has encouraged officals to deliberate more on the decision on vaccinating children. Emphasising that India has adequate vaccines and has been forthcoming in supporting other countries with medical products and services, Mandaviya said India will be a major supplier of affordable Covid vaccines to the world in future. "We will provide vaccines to the world in future and that will be low-cost vaccine – not the one for $15-18 but for $3-4 – and people across the world will take it. We can help poor countries like that and this the Indian culture," Mandaviya said. A total of 31 crore doses of Covid-vaccines will be supplied in November and companies have been constantly increasing manufacturing capacity. More companies are going to start vaccine manufacturing in India and production will increase further in coming months to meet requirement worldwide, he added. At present, the government is focused on maximising coverage of first and second doses of vaccines. While 16 crore unutilised doses of Covid vaccine are available with states and UTs, 79% of eligible population has been covered with the first dose, whereas 38% have received both. Over 12 crore people are due for their second dose. While the Centre remains confident of meeting the December deadline for full coverage of the adult population, Mandaviya said it is pushing states to ensure the results at the earliest. The health minister also said that the government has used the opportunity to ramp up health infrastructure and facility across the country so that it is prepared to efficiently tackle any such future pandemic or health emergency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jabs-for-kids-centre-to-be-cautious-says-health-minister-mansukh-mandaviya/articleshow/87656115.cms||---

DCP (traffic-west) Kuldeep Kumar Jain said P Mativannan, a resident of Tiruppur in TN, was arrested by traffic police for mowing down a 25-year-old private company employee in October 2005. Mativannan worked with a travel agency in Tiruppur. “Mativannan drove to the city in his owner’s SUV to drop some passengers. On his way back, he rammed a biker near Marenahalli junction in Vijayanagar, killing the rider on the spot. Mativannan was arrested and chargesheeted under IPC section 304A (causing death due to negligence). Accordingly, a local court convicted him and sentenced him to one-year simple imprisonment and slapped a fine of Rs 3,000. He went elusive soon after,” said Jain. In July this year, the matter came up during a review meeting and a police team led by inspector GY Giriraj visited Tiruppur. However, cops returned empty handed as Mativannan, 48, had shifted his residence. “The team contacted his previous owner, with whom Mativannan worked. The owner told us that Mativannan had quit long ago. After much effort, we managed to get his mobile number and, finally, traced him to a different place in Tiruppur and arrested him on Wednesday,” added Jain. Mativannan was produced before the court which had convicted him and was sent to judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/convict-on-the-run-for-14-yrs-arrested/articleshow/87656171.cms||---

While the maximum temperature in the city dipped to as low as 19.8 degrees Celsius, the minimum was 18. Things are likely to remain this way for the next two days until the clouds clear out. For the next two days, Bengaluru can expect a generally cloudy sky along with moderate to heavy rain and light to moderate rain for two days thereafter. According to the Met department, districts in south interior Karnataka, including Bengaluru, will receive moderate to heavy showers at isolated places over the next 24 hours, whereas rain/ thundershowers are very likely at isolated places over coastal Karnataka and a few places over north interior Karnataka. Heavy to very heavy rain is likely to occur at isolated places over Bengaluru Urban, Bengaluru Rural, Chikkaballapur, Kolar, Chitradurga and Tumakuru districts of south interior Karnataka during the next 24 hours for which a yellow alert has been issued. The day-long drizzle though reduced traffic to a near crawl in several parts of Bengaluru, including Hebbal flyover, early in the morning and evening due to poor visibility. Commuters had to keep their vehicle headlights on for clear view. A tree each was uprooted on the road from Silk Board towards Marathahalli, in Malleswaram and in Shankar Math ward.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/nippy-wet-weather-makes-blureans-nostalgic/articleshow/87656175.cms||---

The parishe was a low-key affair last year due to Covid-19 curbs. It was restricted to Bull Temple premises and no stalls were seen in and around Basavanagudi Main Road. “We are in celebration mood now. After two years we want the parishe to get back its glory. Kadalekai Parishe is a heritage festival of Namma Bengaluru. We want this tradition to continue and the younger generation should know about...,” said Basavanagudi MLA Ravi Subramanya. Though the actual event is on November 29, it will begin two days earlier as it is weekend. As many as 1,000 groundnut farmers are expected to set up shop this parishe, a 480-year-old tradition that has been kept alive. “After the outbreak of Covid-19 last year, Kadalekai Parishe was called off. As the number of cases has dropped this time, there is no need to impose any prohibition. However, our officials had a preliminary meeting with the organisers. We plan to hold the fair by following Covid protocols,” said BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta. The fair draws around six lakh people every year. “This year the same footfall is expected,” added Subramanya. Years ago many villages stood where Basavnagudi is now and groundnut was a major crop in the region. Legend has it that a bull arrived every full moon night and grazed on the crop. Farmers pledged their first crop to Nandi (Lord Shiva’s vehicle) to ward off bull raids on their crop. Later, in the16th century, the Bull Temple was built and farmers from surrounding villages started coming each year to the temple to offer their annual produce.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/after-covid-lull-kadlekai-parishe-to-make-a-grand-comeback-from-nov-27/articleshow/87656163.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Another grandson of HD Deve Gowda may take the plunge into electoral politics||BENGALURU: The December 10 polls to 25 legislative council seats from local bodies may see the political debut of another scion of former prime minister HD Deve Gowda as Suraj Revanna, former minister HD Revanna’s first son, is seeking a ticket from Hassan district. If Suraj, 34, gets the nod to contest the MLC elections, he will become the eighth member of the Gowda clan to enter electoral politics and the third grandson of the patriarch to face an election on a JD(S) ticket. His younger brother Prajwal Revanna, Lok Sabha member from Hassan, and cousin Nikhil Kumaraswamy unsuccessfully contested parliamentary polls from Mandya in 2019. Apart from Gowda, who is a Rajya Sabha member, six of his family members are into active politics. Former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy and his elder brother Revanna have been contesting elections for more than 25 years, while Kumaraswamy’s wife Anitha Kumaraswamy is an MLA and Revanna’s wife Bhavani Revanna was a member of Hassan zilla panchayat till June when its term expired. “The party will finalise the candidate from Hassan on Friday at the meeting of district leaders convened by Deve Gowda,” said JD(S) state president HK Kumaraswamy. “Certain names, including Suraj Revanna’s, have cropped up and the selection will be made by the brass based on merit and consultation.” While 25 seats are going to polls, JD(S) has a fair chance of winning one from Hassan district, which has two corporations (Hassan and Arsikere), four city municipal councils (Holenarasipura, Channarayapattana, Beluru and Sakleshpur), two town panchayats (Alur and Arkalgud) and 250 gram panchayats. The confidence stems from the fact that the party enjoys a majority in all local bodies barring Belur CMC where Congress is the single largest party. Although JD(S) seems to have a clear edge over its rivals, the party does not want to take a chance going by the experience of 2015 when Gopal Swamy from Congress handed a shocking defeat to its candidate Patel Shivaram. A section of JD(S) functionaries is batting for Suraj, while some are backing his mother Bhavani as the second choice. “People of Hassan are in favour of Bhavani and they want to see her as their MLC. Suraj is also favourable as a young face,” said KS Lingesh, Belur MLA and Hassan district president, JD(S). Suraj, a medical doctor, already took a plunge into active politics as he was elected director to Hassan district cooperative bank last year and is now aspiring to be an MLC. However, sources said it won’t be easy for him or his mother as internal politics within the family may come in the way. “No decision on fielding Suraj Revanna or any other candidate has been taken yet. There are six MLAs and many senior leaders in Hassan. The candidate will be finalised based on their suggestions,” said HD Kumaraswamy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/another-grandson-of-deve-gowda-may-take-the-plunge-into-electoral-politics/articleshow/87656159.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

A fan of Puneeth Rajkumar who passed away recently, Rujula dedicated her moment of glory to the Kannada movie star.Rujula’s biggest win on the day came in the girls U-17 final against Neysa Cariappa. Up against the third seed, the 14-year-old Rujula, who was seeded sixth in the age group, prevailed in a tough first game before claiming the title 22-20, 21-12 in 40 minutes.The first game was a seesaw affair which both players dominated in turns. The second witnessed a resurgent Neysa leading 9-7 at one point and looking set to level the scores. But Rujula, an eighth standard student of Sophia High School, upped her game by a few notches, yielded just three more points to her opponent before sealing the match.Rujula’s triumphant run began in the morning when she, as the top seed, made a clean sweep of the U-15 girls titles. First, she eased past Mounitha AS to the U-15 singles crown 21-12, 21-13 before combining with Meghashree GS to put it across Jade Anil and Diya Bheemaiah 21-19, 21-18.“Full credit to her coach Mohan sir of Patel’s Inn. Rujula has been training under him right from the beginning. Her biggest achievement came in 2019 when she won all the seven state ranking tournaments in the U-13 category. She lost one full year in the U-15 section because of Covid in 2020. This year, she won both the tournaments that she has played in,” her father Ramu said.About Rujula’s favourite actor Puneeth, Ramu added: “We would take a detour and pass by the actor’s home every day on our way to her practice sessions hoping that Rujula would get to see him. But it never happened. Rujula felt dedicating the titles was the best way to pay tribute to him.”Fifth seed Satvik Shankar emerged champion among U-17 boys, beating third seed Nicholas Nathan Raj 21-16, 21-17.

"Installs had dipped between Q3 2020 and Q2 2021 following the removal of PUBG Mobile in India. The last quarter PUBG Mobile was the top game globally was Q4 2018," the Sensor Tower Q3 report said.Last year, the Indian government banned 118 Chinese apps and games, including PUBG Mobile. But it returned to India in June this year with the release of Battlegrounds Mobile India, which helped it achieve more than 200% growth quarter-on-quarter in Asia. More than 36 million of PUBG Mobile’s 45 million Google Play installs in Asia came from its version for India.

MLC and BJP city president Pravin Datke said the BJP-led central government had reduced Rs 5.8 and Rs 12 on petrol and diesel, respectively, but the MVA government was not concerned about the citizens. Pravin said, “Why is the so-called ‘janata raja’ of Maharashtra Sharad Pawar quiet now, and not taking the lead to ask chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and his government to reduce the VAT on petrol and diesel?” BJP leader Sanjay Bhende said the central government in one stroke reduced the rates of petrol and diesel and since then, Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and Congress — the three main components of MVA government in Maharashtra — are having sleepless nights as they used to blame Centre for high rates of fuel but now it’s their turn to show that they really care for citizens by reducing VAT on these items in Maharashtra. He added, “Nawab Malik has time to come in front of the media daily but doesn’t have time to talk on fuel prices. Nor is he concerned about the statewide strike of state transport employees, that is effecting the citizens.” BJP Hingna MLA Sameer Meghe said apart from the high petrol and diesel prices, citizens’ electric lines are also being cut by the MSEDCL staff. “This has created great anger amongst the citizens against the MVA government,” Meghe added. Members of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, led by Shivani Dani, Yash Satpute and others, burnt an effigy of MVA government with posters of Uddhav Thackeray, Ajit Pawar and Balasaheb Thorat, at Variety Square during the protest. BJP leaders like party general secretary Chandrashekhar Bawankule, MLAs Krishna Khopde and Vikas Kumbhare, MLC Girish Vyas, BJP Nagpur rural president Arvind Gajbhiye, Sanjay Bangale and members of Bharatiya Janata Mahila Aghadi were also part of the protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-stages-protest-against-mva-govt-for-not-reducing-vat-on-fuel-prices/articleshow/87670857.cms||Ranjit Deshmukh

On this occasion, the general manager (operation and maintenance), general manager (maintenance) of the project, employees of Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) among others were also present. The foundation stone of BRBCL was laid jointly on February 18, 2004 by the then railway minister Nitish Kumar, Union power minister Anant Ganga Ram Geete and Union minister of state for power Jayanti Ben Mehta. A total of four units of 250 MW each were to be built in this project, which would have given its total generation capacity of 1000 MW. After initial difficulties, the project was finally completed with an estimated cost of about Rs 8000 crore. The entire project site is spread over an area of 1600 acres. This is the first project of Bhartiya Rail Bijli Company formed as a joint venture of Indian Railways and NTPC, 90% of the electricity generated goes to railways and the remaining 10% to Bihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/trial-run-of-brbcls-4th-unit-of-power-project-completed/articleshow/87653554.cms||---

BoB holds a 44% stake in IndiaFirst with Union Bank and Carmel Point Investment (Warburg Pincus) 30% and 25% respectively. “Life insurance had a bit of a rough ride during Covid, but this company has continued to perform very well. In the last quarter, it was the fastest-growing life insurer and its ranking moved up from 12 to 10,” said BoB MD & CEO Sanjiv Chadha. “We are very invested in the business and we are growing it very aggressively and we believe that we are reaching an inflection point and looking at an opportunity for monetisation next year.” Chadha confirmed that an IPO was one of the routes being considered. According to Chadha, BoB is repositioning itself on the basis of how the world has changed with respect to technology. “Even if you are a universal bank, if you do not have an aggressive and effective digital strategy you will be left behind. That, I think, is the biggest challenge.” He added that the bank would create competitive advantages by building up capabilities for digital sourcing and delivery of business.At the same time, the bank would continue to rationalise costs in other areas. “We are looking at some global operations, which are either subscale or don’t have too much growth potential to see whether we can close them down. While the international book will grow, the footprint would be lighter,” said Chadha. He added that the international finance centre at GIFT City would become an important part of the bank’s international book.The bank has exited South Africa, Hong Kong, Trinidad & Tobago and Guyana and is now looking at Malaysia. Last year, the bank rationalised nearly 1,300 of its domestic branches following the amalgamation of Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank with itself. This has resulted in the bank’s rental expenses coming down by 5%. On credit growth, Chadha said that he expects fresh investments in steel and cement by existing players. “Because these are brownfield investments, the growth would be fairly quick compared to greenfield projects. Also, as these are existing strong players, the quality of credit will be good,” said Chadha.While an increase in interest rates would lead to treasury gains tapering off, Chadha said that this would be compensated by interest income as credit picks up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bob-plans-to-list-life-arm-next-fiscal/articleshow/87655073.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Business||Credit inquiries surge 54% YoY across Feb-Oct||Mumbai: A TransUnion Cibil study has said that India’s retail credit market is poised for strong growth supported by a significant resurgence in credit demand as well as supply, despite the second wave of the pandemic. The findings are based on inquiry volumes with the bureau, which increased by 54% between February and October this year, as economic activity gained momentum. Meanwhile, outstanding balances and credit-active consumers grew by 8% and 7% respectively in August 2021 over the previous year. TransUnion’s forecast is based on its credit market indicator (CMI), which factors in credit inquiries, actual lending, consumer behaviour and delinquencies. The CMI is highest for public sector banks at 97, followed by private banks at 91 and NBFCs lagging at 88. Although NBFCS saw less of a recovery after the first wave of the pandemic due to higher delinquencies, they have also seen a sharp recovery in credit health. “Lenders have adapted quickly to the shift in new credit originations via digital channels, which has become the new normal in the pandemic environment. They’ve managed to do this whilst adapting strategies to ensure risk stays within acceptable limits,” explained TransUnion Cibil MD and CEO Rajesh Kumar. State-wise, the CMI has improved most for Maharashtra followed by Gujarat, Delhi and West Bengal. It has deteriorated most for Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. According to the report, inquiry volumes have increased by 20% between February and August 2021 compared to a decline of 31% during the same months last year. The increased demand is driven by consumption products (personal loans, credit cards and consumer durable loans). Inquiries for consumption products have increased by 29% between February and August this year compared to a decline of 42% during the same months last year. Credit demand has further improved with the onset of the festive season. Inquiry volumes have increased by 54% between February and October this year from a 12% decline during same period in the previous year. While balances have increased 12.4% in August this year over August 2020, lenders have turned cautious and approval rates have dropped by 4% during the same period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/credit-inquiries-surge-54-yoy-across-feb-oct/articleshow/87655012.cms||---
---||Business||Digital doubled banking plaints in 2 yrs: RBI data||Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India’s ‘One Nation, One Ombudsman’ scheme is part of its strategy to address customer complaints, which have doubled in the wake of a surge in banking transactions due to increased digital adoption. According to RBI data, with increased awareness, digital penetration and financial inclusion, the number of complaints against various regulated entities more than doubled from 1.6 lakh in FY18 to 3.3 lakh FY20. The integrated ombudsman scheme will be launched by the Prime Minister on Friday along with the scheme for retail participation in the primary auction of government securities. Under the retail G-Secs scheme, individual investors can access the online portal to open a securities account with the RBI, bid in primary auctions and buy & sell securities in the market. No fee will be charged for any of the services provided under the scheme. The integrated scheme allows customers to file their complaints from anywhere at any time through portal/email, or through physical mode at one point of receipt, without the need to identify any specific ombudsman or scheme. It will do away with the jurisdictional limitations as well as limited grounds for complaints. The RBI will provide a single reference point for the customers to submit documents, track the status of complaints filed and provide feedback. The complaints that are not covered under the ombudsman scheme will continue to be attended to by the regional offices of the RBI. The integrated ombudsman scheme is based on a review of internal grievance redressal of banks and other regulated entities. Following the review, the RBI decided to merge the ombudsman scheme for banking, NBFCs and digital transactions. These schemes were administered through 22 offices of the RBI ombudsman and complaints falling outside their purview are attended to by the consumer education and protection cells at the 30 regional offices of the central bank. Based on the review, the RBI decided to integrate the three ombudsman schemes into one, and also extend it to cover all complaints involving deficiency in service and centralise the receipt and initial processing of complaints to enhance process efficiency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/digital-doubled-banking-plaints-in-2-yrs-rbi-data/articleshow/87655187.cms||---

This enables the merchants to become part equity owners of the company. BharatPe will create an equity pool structure worth up to $100 million for the MSP to be allotted to eligible merchants over the course of the next four years. “The company is aiming that the MSP pool will be worth close to $1 billion by the time it goes public,” Bharat Pe said in a statement. It expects the programme to drive better merchant stickiness and enhance loyalty among merchant partners. “While we as a startup community celebrate the coming of age with multi-billion dollar IPOs, there is resentment brewing elsewhere. Millions of consumers and merchants are feeling left out of the digital/startup value-creation in India,” said BharatPe co-founder and MD Ashneer Grover. “This reiterates the company’s commitment to positively impact the lives of all its merchant partners who have played a key role in the adoption of digital payments and the growth of the company.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bharatpe-will-offer-100mn-equity-to-retain-merchants/articleshow/87654787.cms||Mayur Shetty

It took 35 days for Rafi Kollam to reach Jaipur. He will reach Delhi by November 13 and meet Youth Congress national president Srinivas BV. He will also attend a parliament march to protest against the fuel price hike on November 20 before leaving for Kerala. Rafi, who had worked in Dubai as a human resource manager earlier, said he started the journey on cycle to connect with people and understand their point of view regarding the Congress and its prospects. According to his interaction with people from various walks of life on his way, in some states it is the caste factor playing against the Congress, while in states like Gujarat and Maharashtra, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had been using the police and state agencies against the Congress leaders. He said they have been switching sides fearing harassment. He claimed that the Congress had a strong base everywhere it was important to channelise the support, especially from the youth, for the benefit of the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/kerala-man-cycles-to-city-protesting-fuel-price-hike-meets-pilot/articleshow/87655151.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Civic bodies up the heat on non-veg street food vendors||Vadodara/Rajkot: Though they have always been an eyesore in the state, Rajkot and Vadodara municipal corporations have of late issued directives to ensure that non-vegetarian street food carts stay ‘invisible’ to public eye. The first to crack the whip was the ruling BJP in Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) which orally ordered officers to remove street vendors selling non-vegetarian food and egg dishes from the main roads. A drive in this regard started in the city for the past two days, albeit there is no notification or official order issued to this effect. Officials, however, maintain that they are not specifically targeting non-veg food vendors but are taking action anywhere they receive a complaint of encroachment. Rajkot mayor Pradeep Dav himself started the drive after he got several complaints. Dav held meetings with some non-vegetarian food vendors before Diwali and instructed them to shift from the main roads. Dav told TOI, “I have asked officials to shift non-veg and egg ‘larris’ (carts) from major crossroads and those that park themselves near the temples. A majority of people feel disgusted while passing by these carts because of its smell and many also hang chicken outside.” Municipal commissioner Amit Arora said, “There is no specific instruction to remove non-veg carts. We remove all kinds of encroachment specifically where we get complaints of encroachment.” RMC has seized six carts selling non-veg food items in the past two days. There was a suggestion to develop a hawker zone specially for non-veg street vendors but for that RMC has found no suitable place. Like Rajkot, orders in Vadodara too are oral and no notification has been brought out so far. In Vadodara, chairman of the standing committee of Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC), Dr Hitendra Patel gave instructions in this regard to officials at a meeting on Wednesday evening. Patel, however, assured that the vendors will not be ousted. “We are asking the vendors to ensure that they do not hang or display non-vegetarian food. They will have to keep it covered,” said Patel. The chairman said that this was done to ensure that hygiene is maintained and sentiments are not hurt. At the other end, the state president of National Association of Street Vendors of India, Arvind Sindha, who is from Vadodara claimed that non-vegetarian food vendors had been asked to move away from main roads. “They have been told to move away from 30m and 18m roads,” he said. Refuting this allegation, Patel, however, said that the carts were only being asked to ensure they do not hamper traffic movement. “At times there is heavy rush at such places and leads to traffic problems,” he said. Meanwhile, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation standing committee chairman said, “We had in fact begun a campaign against non-veg food stalls selling without licences in front or near religious places. The campaign is still on and I will take a review of this shortly.” ‘Why not cover veg food too?’ VMC standing committee chairman Dr Hitendra Patel sighted maintaining hygiene as one of the reasons behind the instructions to cover non-vegetarian food. In response, state president of the National Association of Street Vendors of India, Arvind Sindha, said that the same rule should be made applicable to all street food vendors. “Even carts selling vegetarian items too should made to cover properly,” Sindha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/civic-bodies-up-the-heat-on-non-veg-street-food-vendors/articleshow/87654611.cms||---
---||Goa||Low pain threshold, parents’ demands spiking Goa’s caesarean rate: Doctors||PANAJI: At 39%, Goa’s caesarean delivery (c-section) rate, which has been much higher than the national rate of 17.5%, will need long-term, definitive and sustained measures to drop. Although the high prevalence of c-sections is blamed on late marriages and the consequent delay in motherhood, other factors have also contributed to the high rate of the medical intervention in the state. Experts say a low pain threshold among mothers-to-be, a growing desire of parents to have a child born on a certain day or at a fixed time (muhurat), seeking that a child is born before December 31 so that a year is not wasted and admission to a desired school is assured upon six years of age, and increased incidence in assisted pregnancies have all led to a drastic rise in c-sections in India’s tiniest state. Interestingly, the trend of c-sections has grown despite the risks involved being much higher than a vaginal delivery. Goa records 17,000-18,000 live births annually. “Various factors are responsible, but caesarean deliveries on demand have become popular. In several cases, a woman and her family insist on it because she does not want to endure labour pains. If a doctor declines, there’s a chance that she will go to another hospital,” senior obstetrician and gynaecologist Dr Govind Kamat said. He said that a woman who has delivered her first child through c-section, is likely to undergo the procedure for subsequent births. “A doctor, too, will likely opt for a caesarean delivery to avoid the risk of rupture of the scalp while performing a vaginal delivery of the second child,” Kamat said. Diet, a woman’s age of attaining motherhood, and her threshold for pain are among the important factors that will decide if she will able to have a normal delivery. Conversely, a lack of awareness and fear of pain could also push her to make the wrong choice. “Sometimes, it’s the parents who plead for a caesarean delivery as they can’t bear to see their daughter in pain and distress. Unlike their predecessors, women today are not accustomed to hard labour,” another senior obstetrician and gynaecologist Dr Ajit Mopkar said. “At times, even women who favour vaginal births will demand a c-section once they go into labour and will not take no for an answer. In such situations, doctors are left with no option but to oblige.” Obstetrician and gynaecologist Dr Deepti Pinto Rosario said that efforts have to be made to avoid a first c-section in every expectant mother. “Even if a woman has had a prior caesarean delivery, she can assess her chances of having a vaginal delivery the second time around,” she said. A woman who has had her first child though c-section will have around 30 to 50% chances of a vaginal delivery subsequently, senior obstetrician and gynaecologist at the GMC Dr Ajit Nagarsenkar said. He said that the option could be explored if the woman does not have other obstetric and medical conditions and could be a way to curtail the rising rates of c-sections in the state. “We need to be very strict about primary (first) c-section of every mother to be,” he said. While unreasonable demands by families during childbirth are not uncommon, Mopkar said he doesn’t give in to such diktats. “A delivery through c-section will not be conducted before schedule if there is no strong medical ground to do so,” he said. Doctors also see a significant section of women becoming mothers late and contributing to the trend of c-section. After failing to conceive naturally, their only hope of giving a birth is through in-vitro fertilisation (IVF), with increased chances of a c-section to avoid complications during childbirth. The GMC, too, receives such cases of women becoming pregnant during their 40s through IVF and approaching the institute for delivery. “Normally, 10% of total deliveries in any set-up have to be through c-section due to various complications. The caesarean method was introduced for a safe delivery when vaginal births became difficult, but otherwise, the emphasis has to be on delivery normal process,” Nagarsenkar said. Rosario said education and dispelling fears around childbirth will go a long way in preparing a woman and her family for labour. While Goa’s c-section rate is close to 40%, Nagarsenkar said that there’s still scope to reduce it by at least 10%. The GMC sees about 4,000 deliveries a year, with 35% being c-sections. “Our c-section rate is about 35% because 25 to 30% of the cases that we see are complicated and referred by other hospitals,” he said. “Considering all factors, there will have to be awareness that a vaginal delivery is a safe delivery. After all, childbirth is a physiological process, a normal procedure, that has to be allowed without much interference provided there are no indications of complications to the mother and child,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/low-pain-threshold-parents-demands-spiking-goas-caesarean-rate-doctors/articleshow/87655406.cms||Bindiya Chari

He said the next generation should know about the works of Azad, who was the first education minister of the country. The CM felicitated retired paediatrician from Jamui, Dr Shankar Nath Jha, with Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Award for his work in the field of education. Dr Jha has been working diligently to impart education to the deprived sections of the society, especially from the Musahar community. He was awarded with a citation, cash prize of Rs2.5 lakh and a shawl. Dr Jha, also a social activist, prevented 450 child marriages and helped in admission of 950 child labourers in schools. He also kept 850 children suffering from malnutrition under his care and helped them regain health and pursue education. Due to his efforts, many Musahar community kids are pursuing higher studies after graduation. Addressing the media after the programme, Nitish said the state has been organizing the education day since 2007. “Later, I wrote a letter to the central government to organize education day at the national level also. The Centre accepted my proposal and this day has been organized at the national level as well from November 11, 2008,” he said. The CM said the Covid-19 situation has been improving in the state due to continuous testing and vaccination. “We believe that we will soon win the fight against the Covid-19,” he said and congratulated everyone for the peaceful Chhath Puja celebration. Additional chief secretary (education) Sanjay Kumar said education to all is the state government’s top priority. “Around 20% of the state budget is being spent on education sector. We have high schools in every panchayat. Now, every sub-division will have degree colleges. We are also making efforts to start postgraduate colleges in every district. Of the 38 districts, 29 have postgraduate colleges,” he said. Education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary, health minister Mangal Pandey, building construction minister Ashok Choudhary, CM’s principal secretaries Deepak Kumar and Chanchal Kumar, chief secretary Tripurari Sharan, development commissioner Amir Subhani, CM’s secretary Anupam Kumar, Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh and other dignitaries were present during the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-schoolchildren-to-learn-about-maulana-azads-works/articleshow/87652934.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Patna||Stress on giving 1st jab to all by Nov 30, says Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya||PATNA: The state has targeted all the eligible and willing beneficiaries to administer the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine by November 30 with stress on those who are eligible, but not willing to take the shots. In a survey conducted in Bihar, nearly 10 lakh people were found to have refused jabs. At a meeting with state health ministers, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Thursday instructed them to strengthen the ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ campaign and ensure that every eligible beneficiary takes both the doses of Covid-19 vaccines. As per the state health department’s data, there are 7.43 crore beneficiaries in Bihar and 69.4% of them had taken the first dose and 39.4% both the doses till November 10. State Health Society additional executive director Animesh Kumar Parashar said they were already carrying out ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ campaign and 8200 mobile bikes were used in a special drive on November 7 to vaccinate the beneficiaries. Parashar said apart from the 10 lakh those who refused, nearly 30 lakh eligible beneficiaries were found pregnant women and many of them were also hesitant in taking vaccines. “We will focus on vaccinating pregnant women on November 13, as they will be coming to the health centres for antenatal check-up as a part of Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyaan. Healthcare workers will counsel such women and ensure that they take their doses,” said Parashar. He further said that the department was roping in various development partners like WHO and UNICEF to push such beneficiaries to take the vaccines. An official in the health department said several such beneficiaries were residing in one hamlet. “Few people also avoided vaccination because of the festivals. Now we expect them to take their shots,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/stress-on-giving-1st-jab-to-all-by-nov-30/articleshow/87652546.cms||Sheezan Nezami

---||Patna||Bihar: Sudha milk, dairy products become dearer||PATNA: The Bihar State Milk Cooperative Federation Limited (Comfed) has increased the prices of all varieties of milk and other dairy products by Rs2 to Rs4/litre under its brand Sudha from Thursday, inviting sharp criticism from the residents, who are already hard-pressed due to rising prices of other essential commodities. The Comfed officials attributed it to rise in fuel and fodder prices, input and operational cost. They said the rate of milk procurement from livestock owners has also been increased by Rs2.32/litre. Sudha Cow milk cost has been increased from Rs43 to Rs46/litre and of Sudha toned milk from Rs41 to Rs43/litre. Sudha double-toned milk has been priced at Rs40/litre, Sudha standard milk at Rs49/litre, tea special at Rs43 and full cream milk at Rs56/litre. The rates of paneer, milk cake, gulab jamun and balushashi have also been increased by Rs4. Nitin Choudhary of Ashiana Nagar said it was unfair to increase the milk prices. “We are already burdened with the rise in prices of household essentials,” he said. “The prices of milk products had been increased in February this year and again they have revised the rates. The household budget is already in a mess due to rise in fuel prices, foodgrains, vegetables and fruits. How will we increase our immunity, if we constantly cut the household budget,” said Dipti Sinha of Gardanibagh. Shanti Devi from Bhattacharyya Road area said all essential items of daily use have become costlier. “The government should think about common people,” she said. The state bakery association has recently increased the prices of different types of bread by Rs2 to Rs5 per packet. Sandwich bread of 175gm is now available at Rs15 per packet. Prices of multigrain and brown bread has increased from Rs35 to Rs40 per packet. Pav is now being sold at Rs22 and fruit bread at Rs20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sudha-milk-dairy-products-become-dearer/articleshow/87652512.cms||---
---||Mumbai||This is how you protect women? City police have no discipline: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Hearing a torture plea from an intercaste couple on Thursday, an HC bench noted that the senior inspector and the investigating officer (IO) were not in court. Prosecutor Shahaji Shinde said the IO is busy with Chhath puja bandobast. “This is how we are protecting our ladies (sic) in our city from goons who come from Gujarat and beat them and rape them. There is a serious complaint from a city girl,’’ said Justice S J Kathawalla. Peeved, they asked the police chief to appear through video-conferencing or remain present. Police chief Hemat Nagrale said a zero FIR would be filed and sent to Gujarat police for investigation. But advocate Pranav Badheka, appearing for the couple, objected, saying the conspiracy started in Mumbai. “She is a Maharashtra girl. She was abducted from here. Mumbai police should investigate it,’’ he added. The judges asked DCP (zone X) to “look into it”. “We’ll inquire into the lapses,” Nagrale told the judges, who said there is “no discipline”. The couple, who are residents of Mumbai, had moved court, saying they are facing torture from her family, the sarpanch and community members of their village in Gujarat. She was assaulted and married off forcibly to another man, who raped her. She fled to Mumbai in August and filed a detailed complaint. The judges heard that the Powai police did not act on it. In September, her father-in-law was assaulted at his residence by the man who forcibly married her in Gujarat. They said if the police had acted on her August complaint, the September attack could have been avoided. “Because police have not taken action, it emboldened this man,’’ Justice Kathawalla said. Nagrale said he was not aware of the details of the case but perhaps the IO felt there were too many issues involved such as her going to the village, second marriage and the husband’s complaint of Rs 7 lakh jewellery theft by her. “Is it not the IO’s duty to find out? Why is the police force so insensitive? In the city if such things happen, what will happen in the interiors of the state?” asked Justice Kathawalla. Advocate Murtaza Najmi, appearing for the woman’s father and brother, claimed they are also being oppressed by the community. “As a father, he should have stood by his daughter...You allowed your daughter to be raped. Credit should be given to the husband who stood by her despite what happened,’’ said Justice Kathawalla. When the brother said his wife and child were attacked, the judge said: “You are supporting the samaj. As you sow, so you reap.’’ The matter will be heard on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/this-is-how-you-protect-women-city-police-have-no-discipline-in-mumbai-hc/articleshow/87655646.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Ahmedabad||After Covid lull, Ahmedabad societies put redevelopment on fast track||AHMEDABAD: Cracked walls, fragile roofs, and leaking pipes – residents of old societies had to continue living with these problems when they were forced to put their redevelopment plans on the backburner due to Covid-19. However, things are finally looking up for them as Ahmedabad witnesses a flurry of proposals and consent for redevelopment of old and dilapidated residential buildings. Around 105 societies, mainly low-rises in posh western areas, have either agreed or are in the midst of signing MoUs with developers to raze and rebuild their houses. Of these, 55 societies gave their consent in 2021. In September 2018, the state government amended the Gujarat Ownership Flats Act (1972) to allow redevelopment of societies with consent of 75%, instead of 100%, members. “This gave a boost to redevelopment projects. However, the situation turned gloomy when Covid struck. People feared going for redevelopment as they did not want to move to rented houses or feared delay in project execution due to the pandemic. Since the beginning of 2020, however, around 105 societies have chosen to go for redevelopment. On an average, 3-4 societies have applied for redevelopment every month since January this year,” said an AMC official. In all, some 1,100 low-rise societies which are 25 years or older are eligible for redevelopment, reveals data from the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s town planning department. These 2- or 3-storeyed buildings are mainly concentrated in areas like Navrangpura, Paldi, Stadium, Vadaj, Vasna, Maninagar, parts of Chandkheda, parts of Naroda, and newly incorporated old AUDA areas in the western part of the city. “Developers are targeting low-rise societies in western areas so that they can exploit the underutilized Floor Space Index (FSI) of 3.6 and 2.7 to transform the space into a 14-storeyed apartment,” adds the AMC official. Jitendra Shah, founder of the recently formed 80-member urban redevelopment housing society welfare association (URHSWA), claims that his association members are in talks with 67 housing societies and 15 projects are currently underway. “The underutilized FSI of old low-rise societies works best for developers. For instance, in posh areas like Navrangpura, 60% of project benefits go to residents in terms of the apartment, transit fee, gift money or extra space as well as new amenities while 40% comes back to us as earnings.” He adds that most residents prefer to return to redeveloped flats due to their familiarity with the area and proximity to their relatives, provisions and neighbours. Confirming this, Hemant Zariwala, a resident of Vivekanand society in Jodhpur, says, "One of the major advantages of the redevelopment process is that we get an option of gift money compensation against the extra space. The developer will install furnishings in the area with that sum. Also, we do not have to leave our familiar neighbourhood for better housing options. We took seven months to finalise our redevelopment.” Chitrak Shah, the vice-president of CREDAI-Ahmedabad GIHED, a body of city-based real estate developers, says, “Redevelopment activity in Ahmedabad is gradually gaining traction. Previously, obtaining 100% consent was a challenge. However, with 75% norm coming in, redevelopment of old housing societies in the city has received a boost.” However, not many societies have been able to exact agreements from its members. Alpesh Patel, secretary of a society in Jodhpur, points out, “Having the agreement of 75% members may not work at all times. Ours is a 50-year-old dilapidated society where just two out of the 78 members have disagreed and stalled redevelopment. This was because we had protested when they were operating an office and godown from our residential society earlier. The government should include a mechanism in the GOF Act to mediate in such matters where the will of most is at stake.” “There are 6,714 societies in the city that are registered under the Co-Operative Societies Act, 1962. Most of these societies will be eligible for redevelopment in the next 3-7 years,” says a senior AMC official. Chitrak Shah, who is also managing director and co-founder of Shivalik Group which is already implementing two redevelopment projects in the city and has a few more in the pipeline, says, “Through redevelopment, societies that are 25 or 30 years old will get better facilities and amenities. Apart from profit, intention of redevelopment ur intention is also to provide a better skyline to Ahmedabad.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/after-covid-lull-abad-societies-put-redevelopment-on-fast-track/articleshow/87654576.cms||Paul John
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Schools conduct safety check ahead of NAS today||KOLKATA: Select schools have made arrangements for kids of classes III, V and VIII to take the National Achievement Survey on campus on Friday. The biggest rooms have been earmarked for the exam. On Thursday, these ‘survey rooms’ were sanitised after distanced seating arrangements were made. Reminders have been sent to parents so kids reach school between 7.30am and 8am. After attendance, lots will be drawn for 30 kids per class to be taken for the test. In West Bengal 3,165 schools have been chosen for NAS. The field investigators, who are officials of the education department, and the observers, who are teachers of CBSE schools, reported to the respective co-ordinators on Thursday and a final count was taken in the evening. Some observers collected the survey materials from the co-ordinators on Thursday evening while others will do so by 6am on Friday, before reaching schools by 8am. On Thursday, rosters were prepared by schools to send out teachers to other venues as observers. No teacher from the host school will be allowed to enter its survey room. “The rooms have been fumigated and sanitised, and hand sanitisers have been placed at vantage points. Covid-related signs were put up. A fully equipped isolation room with a nurse has been set up. Our teachers made the kids practice on OMR sheets so that they can familiarise themselves with the technique,” said Koeli Dey, principal of Sushila Birla Girls’ School. St Augustine’s Day School, Shyamnagar, has got its safety protocol assessed and certified by the Quality Council of India before NAS because only Class III children will be assessed here. “We reminded parents about the entry time and the items kids have to carry, like HB pencil, eraser, two masks, sanitiser, water bottle and a small packet of biscuits,” said principal Father Rodney Borneo. South Point High School has sanitised the building and conducted anti-viral treatment. “We have worked on routes kids can take so there is least cross-traffic,” said spokesperson Krishna Damani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/schools-conduct-safety-check-ahead-of-nas-today/articleshow/87654426.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Ahmedabad||Coming soon to Ahmedabad: Helicopter joyrides, air ambulance & seaplane||GANDHINAGAR: The government of Gujarat has set the bar high - quite literally as high as the sky - as it plans to roll out a slew of pre-Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit (VGGS) attractions that will unleash a flurry of activities in Gujarat’s skies. The state civil aviation department, in association with the tourism department, is in the final stages of planning to start helicopter joyrides in the sky over Ahmedabad city. The state has also committed to finally starting its own air ambulance service, providing helicopters on hire to persons to visit places of religious or tourist attraction and most importantly, restarting the Ahmedabad-Kevadiya seaplane service. Top sources in the state government said necessary approvals to operate these services have already been secured from the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and other central government agencies and these attractions will be rolled out before the 2022 edition of the VGGS slated to be held in January. In 2019, the state government purchased a swanky Bombardier Challenger 650 aircraft at the cost of Rs 191 crore. The Beechcraft Super King aircraft, which was being used for dignitaries for the past 20 years before the Bombardier aircraft was purchased, will be converted into an air ambulance. “All necessary approvals for this have been secured for converting the plane into an air ambulance,” officials told TOI. The much publicised seaplane service between Ahmedabad and the Statue of Unity at Kevadiya in Narmada district could not sustain for too long and was discontinued within weeks of being launched last October. Launched amid much fanfare, the sea plane service operated by a private aviation company, has been suspended multiple times since its launch in October 2020 and is not operational as of now. “This time, the state civil aviation department will operate the service between the Sabarmati Riverfront and Kevadiya,” sources said. In what will give a huge boost to recreational activities in Ahmedabad, the government will begin helicopter joyrides in Ahmedabad’s skies on weekends. “The helicopters are likely to take off and land from some point along the riverfront,” officials said. These same helicopters will be rented out to people during the weekdays, officials said. “There are many families who would be interested in visiting religious places like Ambaji or Dwarka or other places where there is no air connectivity as of now. Such persons will be able to hire these helicopters during the week,” said government officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/coming-soon-to-abad-helicopter-joyrides-air-ambulance-seaplane/articleshow/87654531.cms||Kapil Dave
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat’s ‘mad tree’ can be a good one too||RAJKOT: The much-maligned gando baval or prosopis juliflora (PJ) — the invasive ‘alien’ weed that ravaged large swathes of traditional grassland in Kutch decimating livelihood of Banni people — may have the last laugh if a scientific paper can save its existence. For years now, there has been a discussion to eradicate the weed to save the Banni grassland mostly under the demand of the locals. But, a paper recently published by GUIDE (Gujarat Institute of Desert Ecology), suggested making a separate management policy for PJ, as the weed has the capacity to generate lakhs of employment and can usher in major change in the entire ecosystem of Kutch’s Banni land. The paper suggests that PJ can be used in making bread, biscuit, syrup, coffee, cocktails and even brandy apart from its wood being used in making charcoal and generating electricity. It says that PJ’s multifarious usage is well known in various countries, though it has generated very little awareness about its full potential. The paper published in Global Journal of Science Frontier Research suggested better usage with a policy intervention to generate new industry and new employment. It, however, stated that this option is very expensive and practically not possible looking at the experience of other countries. Talking to TOI, one of the authors of this paper and director of GUIDE, V Vijay Kumar said, “We need to make a separate management policy for PJ. We have considered it an alien species but it has economic and environmental potential. We have to make a new management plan for PJ considering its positive and negative points.” Kumar further said that proper planning can help generate massive employment opportunities and usher in economic development to the arid land. Prosopis pods after removing the seeds are rich in protein and glucose. Pods could be useful for making cattle feed mixture, edible biscuits, energy tonic for old people and children, coffee, brandy, prosopis tree gum, but its products are not popular in India and for that spreading of awareness is necessary. In 2009, GUIDE published a research paper named “Prosposis: Ecological, economic significance and management challenges” in which they mentioned the potential capabilities of gando baval . According to the paper, this is an invasive alien species that spreads rapidly — the only negative point of the plant species — but that if this could be controlled, mankind can reap huge benefits from it. Its wood proved to be an important source of domestic fuel in rural households in the last century. The wood burns evenly and does not spark or smoke excessively and the calorific value of wood is quite high. The other use of gando baval wood is for charcoal and electricity generation. The biomass produced from it is used in electricity generation and can generate one MW electricity from 6,169 tonnes of fuel wood. The cost of power generation from PJ is also very cheap.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarats-mad-tree-can-be-a-good-one-too/articleshow/87654548.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

With this, they have become the first Indians to receive the honour. The younger sibling, Faizan, got the national award at a ceremony in Dallas on Tuesday. Speaking on the occasion, he said, “Since the future of a country is dependent on its kids, we began nurturing and mentoring schoolchildren so that they could identify real-world problems and come up with patentable solutions.” Hailing the work of the Mirza brothers, the Freedoms Foundation stated in its 2020-2021 awards booklet, “They are being recognised for their significant contribution to education. Rizwan developed a step-by-step process to help students think like scientists and innovators while Faizan founded the DiscoverSTEM in Plano as part of which kids solve real-world problems.” Rizwan, an alumnus of Indian Institute of Management-Bengaluru and HEC Paris, told TOI over the phone on Thursday that he conducted an intensive two-year research on STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), innovation, child psychology, and learning patterns. On the basis of his research, he prepared a module to mentor kids, make them think like innovators, identify problems, and create patentable solutions. In the process, he co-founded DiscoverSTEM in Texas in 2016. “Since children are out-of-the-box thinkers, they come up with very bright and promising ideas. However, they lack a structured thought process and do not know how to convert an idea into an innovation. That’s why I want to make a difference and give children the right platform to work on their ideas and come up with unique solutions,” Rizwan, who is in Bengaluru at present, said and added that 25 of their students had been awarded for their innovations by the NASA. Sharing a good news with the students here, Rizwan said the DiscoverSTEM Innovation Lab would become functional in India soon. “A large number of our students in the US belong to the Indian diaspora. Hence, we are in the process of launching the programme here as well,” he claimed. Speaking about Rizwan’s DiscoverSTEM programme, Charles A Rodenberger, a top NASA scientist, said, “As a scientist, I have been part of several intensive brainstorming and innovation sessions. I saw similar activities being conducted at DiscoverSTEM, one of the best STEM and Innovation programmes.” Hashima Hasan, another NASA scientist who holds a PhD in nuclear physics, pointed out, “A small mentoring programme, which began in 2016, has evolved so much that its students are winning awards and patenting their innovations.” The Freedoms Foundation was started by former US President Dwight D Eisenhower in 1949.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/in-a-first-2-brothers-from-patna-bag-us-award-for-making-kids-innovators/articleshow/87652304.cms||---

Similarly, a fuel station at Talapady on the border of Dakshina Kannada too has been witnessing an increase in sales considerably as the prices of petrol and diesel are cheaper than Kerala. Meanwhile, the tax cut in Karnataka has impacted a fuel station on the border near Kunjathur in Kerala very badly. The fuel station, which is located just 500 meters away from the DK border at Talapady, lost its large number of customer base after prices were reduced in Karnataka. In fact, the two fuel stations, one in Kerala and another in Karnataka, are less than 500 meters away from each other. Thajuddin, manager of Kerala Fuels at Kunjathur in Kerala, told TOI that the sale reduced by more than 50% after the tax cut in Karnataka. “The sale of petrol in our fuel station reduced drastically from an average of 6,000 litres to 2,000 litres per day. We have been expecting the Kerala government to follow the steps taken by Karnataka to reduce the price. Congress in Opposition in Kerala has been holding protests demanding cut in tax for fuel,” he said. Meanwhile, Galimukha Fuel station at Galimukha has put up banners announcing that petrol and diesel are cheaper by Rs 5 and Rs 8 respectively at their outlet in Karnataka. “Ours is a fuel station located very close to Mulleria town in Kasaragod of Kerala where prices of petrol and diesel costlier. The sale has increased by nearly 60% after the tax reduction by Karnataka. People from border areas of Kerala reach here to fill fuel. Private vehicles and public transportation vehicles from Kerala have been visiting our station to fill fuel. The price of petrol is Rs 100.46 per litre and it is Rs 84.87 for diesel in our station. The price is up by Rs 5 and Rs 8 respectively for petrol and diesel in Kerala,” said Mansukh M, manager of Galimukha Fuel Station. Hameed K, who commutes frequently between Kasaragod and Mangaluru, said, “I fill my car’s fuel tank from Talapady so that I need not pay more in Kerala.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/tax-cut-in-ktaka-sale-in-dk-border-fuel-station-up-by-60/articleshow/87653657.cms||---

Sawant, who was speaking at the National Youth Parliament, said the state is committed to grooming youth in the best possible way to lead democracy. He said if a common man like him could rise to be the chief minister of Goa then there should be no wrong perception that one has to belong to a dynasty to succeed in life. Sawant made a case for the establishment of private universities in the state, such as design and skills universities. There is special focus on upgrading technical education, the chief minister said, for which various youth-oriented courses have been introduced in schools and colleges to provide practical experiences that help them develop skills the industry requires. Only the youth can achieve Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s goal pertaining to the New India Mission, Sawant said, adding that his government has been working tirelessly to provide the best possible facilities for the youth. Speaker of the state legislative assembly, Rajesh Patnekar, who was also present, said, “Adaptation and evolution is the key to success for youth. The youth of today are blessed with technology, which they can tap for seamless e-governance to reshape and revamp this country. The very foundation of active youth participation will rest on knowledge-sharing and networking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-calls-for-more-young-people-in-politics/articleshow/87655170.cms||---

In a bid to get the arithmetic right ahead of the electoral fray, AAP has promised to appoint a chief minister from the Bhandari community if it wins the elections. With the party looking to make strong inroads into Salcete — a Catholic dominated taluka and Congress’ traditional turf, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said during a press conference that the deputy chief minister will be from the Christian community. But he stopped short of announcing any names. The party is yet to declare its candidates for the coming polls. Gomantak Bhandari Samaj’s Ashok Naik recently said that the organisation will support any national party that offers maximum seats to its members at the upcoming assembly elections. AAP national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal met Naik and members of the Bhandari community. “We want to give representation to the Bhandari community in the assembly,” Sisodia said, adding that the Christian community will also be given due importance in the cabinet He said that Congress and BJP have used the Bhandari community and the minorities for their own political gains, but never gave proper representation to the two communities which form a major chunk of Goa’s electorate. Sisodia, who is in Goa to review the preparations for the upcoming elections, said that all religious communities and castes will be given representation in the cabinet if AAP wins a majority in the elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-woos-bhandari-samaj-christians-promises-top-posts/articleshow/87655164.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

While many couples who tied the knot during the first and second iterations of the pandemic promoted awareness about Covid-19 safety norms, on Wednesday, 29-year-old Suchit, who holds an MTech degree, and engineering graduate Rajani, marked their special day here on Wednesday, requesting guests to pledge their eyes for their wedding present. As many as 200 guests to the event were inspired by the bride and groom, who had already pledged their eyes, to follow suit, and pledge their eyes to the SGM Eye Bank.The son of Lingaraj Angadi, former president of the Dharwad unit of the Kannada Sahitya Parishat, Suchit said that he had initially wanted to organise a voluntary blood donation camp at the wedding venue. “But I was informed about the logistical problems this entailed, and decided against it. But I was committed to making a difference to society on the day of my wedding, and that was when we came up with the idea of ‘eye donation pledge’ initiative at the venue,” Suchit told TOI.Generosity appears to the young man’s second nature, given that he has donated blood and platelets a staggering 58 times, besides starting a group called ‘SamVruksha’, the primary aim of which is to help arrange blood for patients in the event of an emergency. Suchit appears to have imbibed this streak to do better by others from his father Lingaraj, who has donated blood 38 times himself.After consultations with Suchit and Rajani, a dedicated counter where guests could fill up a form making a commitment to donate their eyes was set up at the wedding hall, said Dr Srinivas Joshi and Dr Aniket Shastri, SGM Eye Bank officebearers. “Since 2014, four couples who tied the knot in Hubballi have organised such an initiative to mark their wedding day. We observed that people from villages, who were among the guests at the wedding, too volunteered to donate their eyes. More than marking up the number of those who pledge their eyes, it is about raising awareness,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/couple-asks-guests-to-pledgetheir-eyes-as-wedding-gift/articleshow/87653669.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

Mahamandaleshwar Kakeshwari Nandgiri became the center of attraction when she started crawling to the ghat which is around 5 km away from her house. She is also observing 72 hours fast for the well being and prosperity of the nation and her Yajman (clients). “From last 12 years, I have been observing Chhath fast and celebrating the festival following all customs and traditions. Few years ago, I wished something from ‘Chhathi Maiyya’ and it came true, so I decided to crawl to the ghat to make the deity happy. I have been doing this for three years now, and will continue crawling to the ghat for Chhath puja for two more years,” Mahamandeleshwar said. “I also prayed and asked Chhathi Maiyya to keep us safe from the corona pandemic,” she added. Gorakhpur MP Ravi Kishan inspected various Chhath ghats and extended greetings to all on Wednesday. He also gave directions regarding preparation of Chhath puja at ghat. He reached Rajghat, Ramghat at Rapti ghat, Hanumangarhi, Suryakund dham, Mansarover temple and Bheem sarovar in Gorakhnath temple and took stock of preparations and also took blessings of Guru Gorakshnath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/chhath-puja-kinnar-akhara-mahamandaleshwar-crawls-5km-to-ghat/articleshow/87635381.cms||---
---||Jaipur||After 4 years, SC nod for sand mining from river beds in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: The Supreme Court on Thursday gave sanction to sand mining from river beds in the state and approved recommendations made by the central empowered committee (CEC) constituted to look into the matter. Sand mining from river beds has been allowed after almost four years and lease holders are expected to start operations over the next three months after getting environmental clearance (EC) from the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC). Additional chief secretary, mines and petroleum, Subodh Agarwal said, “With our chief minister's efforts, the long-pending issue of illegal bajri mining has been resolved in the state. This will benefit the public at large. At present, there are three large leases operational and five more are expected to start operations soon. More companies will start work as soon they receive EC.” The CEC, constituted by the apex court to look into the issue of illegal sand mining on December 23, 2020, had submitted its report after carrying out a physical inspection. “The recommendations made by the CEC, except recommendation ‘J’, are approved for implementation forthwith,” the court order says. An official with the mining department said the ‘J’ recommendation referred to levying a penalty of Rs 10 lakh per vehicle and Rs 5 lakh per cubic metre of sand seized. The CEC has recommended the MoEFCC to issue EC to all valid letter of intent (LoI) holders recommended by the expert appraisal committee (EAC) within a period of three months and without insisting on the submission of the scientific replenishment report as a pre-condition. The replenishment study will be undertaken during the course of mining. “Out of 82 large leases, the EAC has recommended 65. After the SC nod, they will receive EC within 3 months from the MoEFCC,” an official mining department source said. The SC had earlier restrained operations of large mining lease holders who did not have EC from the ministry. The ministry had later laid a condition for companies to carry out a scientific replenishment study. In its report, the CEC highlighted the delay in granting EC as the main reason for the widening gap between supply and demand, which resulted in the proliferation of illegal mining activities. Following the order, the state government is likely to earn an estimated revenue of Rs 400 crore per annum. A senior mining department official said, “The 65 large leases can mine an estimated 700 lakh tonne from their operations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/after-4-yrs-sc-nod-for-sandmining-from-river-beds-in-raj/articleshow/87655190.cms||Ajay Singh

Bangur Nagar police have registered an accidental death case.A team from Delhi police had approached the local police on Tuesday for help to nab David Roy, who was booked in a narcotics case in Delhi in 2017. Roy lived in Malad's Evershine Nagar with his family. A joint team reached Roy's apartment to look for him. The team took the housing society watchman along and knocked at Roy's door. But nobody opened the door. The police teams left thinking nobody was home after neighbours said they had not seen Roy for a few days. Later, he was found lying in the society compound and was rushed to the Babasaheb Ambedkar Hospital at Kandivali where doctors pronounced him dead.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-climbs-down-bldg-to-escape-falls-to-his-death/articleshow/87655653.cms||---

---||Pune||Baramati youth dies of dengue within five days of illness onset||Pune: Sixteen-year-old Subhash (name changed on request) from Baramati was admitted to Pune’s KEM hospital on the third day of dengue illness on November 8. The boy developed dengue shock syndrome on the fourth day and slipped into coma. His condition rapidly deteriorated and he died following multi-organ failure, the next day. Just like Subhash, dengue-infected young adults from Pune rural are showing severe symptoms of dengue with a steep drop in blood platelet counts on the third or fourth day of illness as against the slow platelet fall usually setting in from the fifth or sixth day onward. Some of these young adults are also showing well-defined build-up of water inside the lungs (pulmonary edema) at an early stage of dengue illness, doctors said. “In the last 15 days, we have seen more than 25 seriously-ill dengue patients from rural parts of Baramati, Phaltan, Daund and Shirur. In addition to showing a terrible drop in platelet count on the third or fourth day, some of them also show severe lung fluid, which is rarely seen at such an early stage,” KEM hospital’s senior physician Rajesh Gadia told TOI. Gadia has treated more than 10,000 dengue patients in the last 25 years. The patients’ platelet counts taking a nosedive in the first five days of dengue illness has left the doctors puzzled. “On the third or fourth day of the fever, patients are presenting with a platelet count of less than 20,000. This is very early and certainly not a good sign,” Gadia said. A normal person has a platelet count ranging between 1,50,000 and 4,50,000 per microlitre of blood. Usually, about 80-90% of patients with dengue have levels below 1,00,000, while just 10-20% see a critically low level of 20,000 or less. In normal scenarios, when platelets drop on the 5-7th day of illness, doctors monitor patients for a couple of days before taking a call on platelet transfusions. “With an early drop in platelet count, we have to monitor the patients for a prolonged period. Besides, these patients quite often require more platelet transfusions. This puts more load on the existing system and a longer hospital stay,” Gadia said. An early manifestation of complications like pulmonary edema is also adding to the patients’ long hospital stay. “This requires immediate ICU treatment,” Gadia said. This year’s most severe dengue cases, doctors said, were due to secondary dengue. “In secondary dengue, there is an antibody-dependent enhancement. So, platelets drop early with the more severe presentation,” said physician Abhijit Lodha. Usually, about 5% of dengue patients face complications, such as bleeding, which require platelet transfusions. “Platelet transfusion in the absence of bleeding does not prevent bleeding. Such a practice is associated with slower platelet recovery and increased length of hospitalization,” said Ruby Hall Clinic’s chief intensivist Kapil Zirpe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/baramati-youth-dies-of-dengue-within-five-days-of-illness-onset/articleshow/87654461.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The Delhi government came under a lot of fire recently on the toxic froth floating over the Yamuna. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is also going to hold a high-level meeting in this regard on Friday, where progress on key projects related to preventing water contamination will be discussed. Delhi Jal Board plans to replace the water network in contaminated areas. The execution of this work is targeted by January next year, informed a source. As part of this drain, two intervention plans of Najafgarh drain and Barapullah drain to improve the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) level will be discussed. BOD is the amount of oxygen level in the river, which indicates the amount of contamination. These interventions will be done so that the treatment plants and filters by the Delhi government do better. “All water pipelines must be monitored thoroughly so that leakage can be minimised and fixed accordingly. The officials should work to solve this problem on war footing,” said Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/expedite-work-on-sewer-lines-to-protect-yamuna/articleshow/87654464.cms||---

In a statement, Bidhuri said that he is happy that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has stated that it is Delhi government’s responsibility to clean Yamuna, instead of blaming the Centre. He said that the Central Government has always given all possible help to the Delhi Government for this work, including a fund of Rs 2,419 crore for cleaning the river. Delhi government didn’t respond to Bidhuri’s comments despite repeated attempts Bidhuri said that Delhi’s 18 big drains are pouring filth into the river Yamuna every day and alleged that while the state government is making announcements to set up sewage treatment plants, all its projects are far behind schedule. He said that for a positive discussion on this issue, an all-party meeting should be convened in which the opinion of all the elected representatives and experts should be taken. He said that there should be no politics in cleaning the river Yamuna. Bidhuri also asked the CM to give Delhiites relief from fuel prices by bringing down the VAT rates to lower than what they were in 2015 as he had allegedly promised earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/make-time-bound-plan-for-yamuna-cleanup-bidhuri-tells-delhi-govt/articleshow/87655655.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Kolkata||Kolkata citizens’ demand: Keep parks & lakes open for longer hours, give access to children||KOLKATA: Citizens are demanding parks and lakes — that currently have very restricted hours of operation — be kept open longer. While the elderly, who find it difficult to wake up early, and professionals, who leave for work early, have been calling for longer park timings for quite some time, even others are now clamouring for parks and lakes to be open all morning and afternoon now that winter is setting in and the early morning air will be laden with pollutants. Parents also want their children to be given access to parks. TimesViewNow that almost everything else is open, it makes no sense to keep parks functioning according to Covid-restricted timings. Winter mornings are often not the ideal time for outdoor exercise — because of heavy pollution and weather conditions — and keeping parks open throughout the day will actually contribute to a healthier city.“Across the city, life is getting back to normal. There is no restriction other than late at night. Malls, movie theatres and activities in other closed spaces have been permitted months earlier. Yet, entry to parks, where risk of transmission is very low, continues to be severely restricted, both in terms of access and timings,” said lawyer Ankit Agarwal, who has been trying to highlight the issue for several months. Those who frequent Rabindra Sarobar, too, want the time of operation to be extended from 6am to 9am and 4pm to 6pm at present to 6am-7pm operation hours so that people can walk in later in the morning, afternoon or evening. “I doubt if restricting entry to parks and lakes ever made sense, but even if it did, persisting with the restricted timings is absurd, particularly now that winter is around and doctors advise avoiding early-morning walks and going for exercise later in the day when the sun is up. I believe it is really a manpower issue rather than Covid that has prompted the authorities to continue with the shorter hours,” said S M Ghosh, a Lake regular. He also argued that while turnout at the Lake will increase when timings are relaxed, it will be spread out through the day and not lead to crowding in the morning. Joydeep Dutta Gupta, another regular at the Lake, has been unable to understand the logic behind the restricted timings and also of keeping children out of the only places they can safely play outdoors. “Lakes and parks should be open till at least 11am and then again from 2pm or 3pm,” he said. Parents and school principals are demanding that children be allowed to access parks and lakes that have been off-limits for over a year-and-a-half. “Children have suffered the most in the last year-and-a-half due to the pandemic — no schools, few engagements with friends and hardly any excursion. They really have no place to go as opposed to adults who may go to work and meet friends. Many children are beginning to have issues related to motor movements and confidence, resulting in therapy intervention,” said Kaavya Gupta, a parent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/citizens-demand-keep-parks-lakes-open-for-longer-hours-give-access-to-children/articleshow/87654459.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The police identified the accused as Akhil, 21, of Kadakampally and Sujith, 31, of Muttathara. Both accused are friends and daily wage labourers by profession. The police said that the two men were arrested after receiving a complaint from the mother of a 14-year-old school girl. The complainant stated in her petition that she had bought her daughter a smartphone for attending online classes. But the girl used the phone to create accounts in social media apps such as Whatsapp and Instagram. Akhil got acquainted with her through Instagram and he started sending lewd messages to her. When the mother found out about this, she seized the phone from the girl. But to her shock, Akhil and Sujith turned up at her home and threatened her. It was following this that she filed a complaint before the police. The accused went absconding after the police registered a case and launched the probe. They were held from a hideout in the city by a team led by Pettah station house officer Inspector Riyas Raja and sub inspector P Ratheesh. Besides charges under POCSO Act, the accused were also booked under sections related to house trespass and criminal intimidation. Following the arrest, the accused were produced before the court and remanded in judicial custody.

The state’s active cases per million population as on November 9 were 105, lower than Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Mizoram, Telangana, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur and Meghalaya, the data stated. Maharashtra’s additional chief secretary (health) Dr Pradeep Vyas said, “Though Maharashtra has the second highest active cases in India in terms of absolute numbers, its actual disease burden is much lower than several other states if the number of Covid-19 cases are calculated per million population.” A senior official with the state health department told TOI that calculating the number of Covid-19 cases per million population is the scientific way to compare state-wise burden of any disease, because different states have different population sizes. Maharashtra is the second-most populous state in India after Uttar Pradesh. “Absolute Covid-19 cases in various states cannot convey the real picture of the disease burden in a region. Hence the per million population method is used. For instance, if 50 are infected in a population of 100 people in a state, the attack rate is 50% there. Similarly, if 20 out of 100 are infected in another state, the attack rate is 20% there,” the official said. Health department data showed that Maharashtra’s active cases per million population have also dropped lower than the national average of 116. As on October 26, Maharashtra’s active cases per million residents was 181, which was higher than the national average 135. Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Telangana then had lower active cases per million population in comparison to Maharashtra. State Covid-19 Task Force member Dr Shashank Joshi told TOI, “In the past, Maharashtra did have the second highest active Covid-19 cases per million population among other states, but the situation improved with a consistent drop in new Covid-19 cases. However, a word of caution: states such as Maharashtra and Kerala should not reduce their testing. Testing has gone down in both the states, which should be addressed as soon as possible. We may see a post-festive spike, thus the state needs to be vigilant.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/active-cases/mn-population-in-maha-lower-than-8-states/articleshow/87657517.cms||Neha Madaan

He said that while the main accused worked in the shop, the second accused and his brother ran the shop. The father further said that he had separated from the survivor’s mother in 2010. In 2013, his children went to a fair and met their mother. The mother called him and said that she had asked the girl why her stomach was bloated, but got no answer. Her mother then took her for a sonography that showed the minor was eight months pregnant. The survivor then alleged that the two men drugged and repeatedly raped her in 2012. They had also threatened to kill her father and brother if she told anyone what had happened. Special public prosecutor Geeta Sharma cited the evidence of 13 witnesses, including the survivor and her father, to seek the conviction of the first accused. The prosecution also submitted that DNA evidence showed he was the father of the child. Special Pocso judge Bharti Kale also fined him Rs 20,000. He has been in jail since his arrest in July 2014. His sentence will be set off against time spent in prison as an undertrial. The other parties in the case -- the brother of an accused and two locals were acquitted of charges of failing to report offences against a minor under the Pocso Act. They were also found not guilty for offences under the Child Marriage Restraint Act. While the trial commenced, with the survivor and her father deposing as witnesses in 2018 against two suspects and three others accused of abetment, based on their detailed testimonies, an application was made on their behalf by advocate Wesley Menezes to add the cops as accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rapist-said-hed-kill-her-dad-brother/articleshow/87656030.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Hubballi||Couple asks guests to pledgetheir eyes as wedding gift||Hubballi: Educated youngsters eager to do their bit for a brighter tomorrow are turning their weddings into more than the routine assembly of family and friends. While many couples who tied the knot during the first and second iterations of the pandemic promoted awareness about Covid-19 safety norms, on Wednesday, 29-year-old Suchit, who holds an MTech degree, and engineering graduate Rajani, marked their special day here on Wednesday, requesting guests to pledge their eyes for their wedding present. As many as 200 guests to the event were inspired by the bride and groom, who had already pledged their eyes, to follow suit, and pledge their eyes to the SGM Eye Bank. The son of Lingaraj Angadi, former president of the Dharwad unit of the Kannada Sahitya Parishat, Suchit said that he had initially wanted to organise a voluntary blood donation camp at the wedding venue. “But I was informed about the logistical problems this entailed, and decided against it. But I was committed to making a difference to society on the day of my wedding, and that was when we came up with the idea of ‘eye donation pledge’ initiative at the venue,” Suchit told TOI. Generosity appears to the young man’s second nature, given that he has donated blood and platelets a staggering 58 times, besides starting a group called ‘SamVruksha’, the primary aim of which is to help arrange blood for patients in the event of an emergency. Suchit appears to have imbibed this streak to do better by others from his father Lingaraj, who has donated blood 38 times himself. After consultations with Suchit and Rajani, a dedicated counter where guests could fill up a form making a commitment to donate their eyes was set up at the wedding hall, said Dr Srinivas Joshi and Dr Aniket Shastri, SGM Eye Bank officebearers. “Since 2014, four couples who tied the knot in Hubballi have organised such an initiative to mark their wedding day. We observed that people from villages, who were among the guests at the wedding, too volunteered to donate their eyes. More than marking up the number of those who pledge their eyes, it is about raising awareness,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/couple-asks-guests-to-pledgetheir-eyes-as-wedding-gift/articleshow/87654490.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai
---||Nashik||Probe into baby’s death; parents say no help with delivery||Nashik: Dr Ashok Thorat, the Nashik civil surgeon, has ordered a probe into a newborn’s death at the hospital. Kira Gare, a tribal woman from the Peth taluka, had delivered a baby boy on Tuesday, November 9. The baby died in the morning on Thursday, November 11. For almost eight hours, the aggrieved parents refused to take the body. They relented and took their newborn’s body in the afternoon only after being assured of a proper investigation. The civil surgeon told TOI that he set up a committee after Kailas Gare, the father, made allegations. “I have directed the panel to submit a report within 24 hours. We will decide the course of action after the committee submits its report,” said Thorat. Gare said that his wife was admitted to the hospital early on November 9. “After her admission, when she was going to the toilet, a sweeper at the hospital misbehaved with her and even beat her up. Later, she went into labour and was taken to the delivery room. However, during her delivery, there was no doctor or nurse to help her,” he added. He also approached the Sarkarwada police with a complaint. Kira Gare had delivered the baby around 9 am on November 9. According to her, barring a female relative, there was no one else with her in the labour room. “When I was giving birth, there was no doctor or nurse to hold the baby as it came out. My baby fell into a small bed between my legs, and sustained head injuries,” she alleged. The hospital’s gynaecology department officials refuted the allegation. “Nurses were present during the delivery, which was guided by Dr Promod Chaudhari. It was a case of premature birth of a baby with extremely high blood pressure,” officials added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/probe-into-babys-death-parents-say-no-help-with-delivery/articleshow/87653030.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Delhi||Delhi: Vehicles biggest source of local pollution, says study||NEW DELHI: Vehicles have emerged as the biggest contributor to particulate pollution in Delhi. Their real-time share of vehicular emissions in air pollution has increased to over 50% in early winter (October 24-November 8) this year, says a new analysis released on Thursday by the Centre for Science and Environment. Track the pollution level in your cityCSE has analysed the real-time data on the comparative contributions of different sources to the pollutants in the city’s air compiled by Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology. CSE accessed data for every alternate hour for the October 24- November 8 period. The pollution sources include transport, industry, construction, waste burning, energy, residential sources, road dust and other groups of sources. Stubble burning and pollution across the National Capital Region were not considered. The analysis shows vehicular pollution at more than half of all sources, followed by household pollution between 12.5 and 13.5%. Industry contributed 9.9-13.7% of the pollutants, construction 6.7-7.9%, waste burning 4.6-4.9% and road dust, 3.6-4.1%. This indicative composition is based on the trend every alternate hour in each 24 hours of the study period. An additional CSE analysis of the traffic speed in the city — a measure of congestion — on 15 key stretches during the study period shows that traffic congestion is back to pre-pandemic levels and correlates with the pollution peaks. The traffic speed improved dramatically during the lockdown in 2020. The mean travel speed now is 26 kmph and in peak hours, 23 kmph. In off-peak hours, it is 32 kmph. The speed in the same period in 2019 was 23 kmph in the peak hour, showing traffic build-up has returned to pre-Covid levels, the report said. The CSE report added, “While Delhi needs to speed up action on all key sources of pollution, it requires urgent action to scale up integrated public transport systems, walking and cycling infrastructure, and city-wide parking area management plans to restrain vehicle use. In absence of this reform, Delhi is unable to enforce emergency action to control traffic volumes during smog episodes. Vehicle numbers are explosive at 1.3 crore.” Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), CSE, said, “After the closure of all coal-based power plants, expansion of natural gas usage in industry and controls on dirty fuels, vehicles have emerged as the biggest real-time contributor among the local sources of winter pollution in Delhi this year. Action on transportation has to gather strong momentum. At the same time, action on waste management, clean energy access in households and dust control must be speeded up.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vehicles-biggest-source-of-local-pollution-study/articleshow/87655681.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Pune||Covid tests in Maharashtra dip to 5.58 lakh during festive week||PUNE: Covid detection tests in Maharashtra came down to 5.58 lakh during the Diwali festivities in the November 3-9 week from an average of over 10-11 lakh during the seven-day period in September and October. The recent number of weekly tests in the state was the lowest in the past two months. Public health officials attributed the drop to the festivities and a consistent decline in Covid cases. The Maharashtra task force has now directed the government to scale up the testing, especially in districts with a higher weekly positivity than the state average (1.3%). Public health department registered 3,23,150 RT-PCR and 2,35,813 rapid antigen tests between November 3 and 9 with 17 districts conducting less than 5,000 tests during the period. The highest weekly tests were registered from Mumbai (2.05 lakh), followed by Thane (85,033), Pune (63,044) and Raigad (26,455). The lowest weekly tests were registered in Bhandara (370). “Ten districts continued to register a higher weekly positivity than the state’s average and the testing should be increased there. We cannot be complacent on testing,” task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said. State health minister Rajesh Tope had told TOI that November would be “a crucial month”, due to crowding during the recent festivities. With the state having a capacity to conduct 2-2.5 lakh tests, the districts have been told to not reduce testing. Tope said tests had dropped due to the low daily detections and fewer contacts to track. “We have told the districts to keep a close watch on the situation, especially after the festive season,” he said. From October 31, the daily testing had registered a drop from 1.03 lakh a day to 60,055 till November 8. State task force member Dr Rahul Pandit said the next two weeks were extremely important. He said, “Though most districts in the state are registering lower cases than in the past, testing cannot be reduced. It is crucial to detect the cases at the earliest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covid-tests-in-maharashtra-dip-to-5-58-lakh-during-festive-week/articleshow/87654470.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The cyber cell of Kolkata Police have now claimed to have busted a gang from Darbhanga in Bihar and Madhupur Jharkhand - with their operational base in Mumbai - that had set up a fake website in the name of one of the world’s leading logistics companyand offered to ship electronic items at huge discounted rates on the occasion of Independence Day last August. The accused asked customers - mainly traders from central Kolkata - to make payments in two separate accounts before receiving the goods. The communication was through a fake email ID. The cops found one of these accounts was being operated from Mumbai, the other from Thailand. The cops traced more than two dozen IMEI numbers and reached the accused at Darbhanga. The accused, Shibu Saryug Ray (34), was brought to Kolkata and produced at a local court where he has been sent to police custody till November 20. The FIR was lodged on August 20 this year. “The accused persons had entered into a criminal conspiracy and in pursuant to that dishonestly and fraudulently created one fake website and several fake and misleading mail IDs in the name of the reputed firm and its management. The complainant in this case had visited the website to order some articles required for his business and to ensure they are shipped quickly. Thereafter, the miscreants induced the complainant - by their false representation and assurance of delivery of product - and induced the complainant to pay Rs52 lakh as cost of material and shipment in multiple transactions. Three accounts were provided to him - that of a private sector bank in Mumbai and two foreign bank accounts based in Thailand,” said an investigating officer. “During the investigation we collected the account details, mobile numbers. e-mail address and IMPS details associated with the bank accounts. We also found that the accused persons used huge numbers of IMEI and SIM cards to carry out the fraud. After scrutinizing the IP addresses, IMEI and phone numbers, it was found that the accused person operated from Mumbai but had strong connections with Darbhanga and Madhupur. We constantly tried tracing the phones of the accused and found that he was in Darbhanga and was moving around in the area. A raid was conducted a couple of days ago at Darbhanga and the accused was finally arrested for his direct complicity in the case. A huge incriminating item has been seized from his possession,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cyber-fraud/articleshow/87654497.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Though hundreds of complaints have been filed by residents and councillors for cleaning dirty lanes that may become a breeding grounds for mosquitoes, the company responsible for lifting garbage has been working at a slow pace. There are more than 6,000 dirty lanes in Walled City. Dirty lane is a space given between houses in Walled City for ventilation. Over the years, these lanes have become a dumping ground for garbage. JMC-Heritage councillor Manak Sharma said his area has many kacchi-basti and dirty lanes. “I have written to the mayor, commissioner and deputy commissioner of the zone but nothing has been done. Residents are worried about the impact of dengue on them due to garbage,” said Sharma. When asked about cleaning the lanes, the health deputy commissioner at JMC-Heritage, Ashish Kumar said, “The BVG company has started the process of cleaning the lanes. We have made a WhatsApp group as well in which every complaint is lodged. All the wards will be covered as per plan although it will take some time as the resources for cleaning the lanes are limited.” Many councillors have used their own resources clean the lanes. Councillor Rahees Qureshi said since the number of dirty lanes in his ward was not very high, he was using his own resources to get the lanes cleaned. In Kishanpole, Ramganj and Hawa Mahal areas, there are hundreds of dirty lanes that are filled with garbage. Giriraj Natha, ward 69 councillor, said he cleaned more than 60 lanes in his area using his own resources. “There are around 350 dirty lanes in my area and despite repeated calls to JMC-Heritage, nothing has been done. We have complained many times, but want a final resolution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/amidst-dengue-spread-walled-city-residents-demand-cleaning-of-dirty-lanes/articleshow/87655193.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh adds married daughters in dependents’ list for government jobs||LUCKNOW: Married daughters of government officials, who die during their service period, would also be eligible to get a government job under deceased dependent quota. In a significant development, the state cabinet headed by CM Yogi Adityanath has green- flagged the proposal to include “married daughters” in the category of dependents of deceased government officials to be given a government job on compassionate grounds. The move could potentially lend a renewed traction to BJP's campaign vis-a-vis women empowerment ahead of the UP polls due early next year. The state cabinet cleared the proposal to this effect through a by-circulation late Wednesday night. Until now, only the wife, a married/unmarried son and unmarried daughter were bracketed as dependents of a deceased government official. The cabinet broadened the definition of "dependent daughters" to include the married ones also, officials said. A senior official, however, said that the married daughter will be lower down the order after the deceased's wife, married/unmarried son and unmarried daughter. "She may also get the job if other family members refuse to take up a government job," an official said. The proposal was moved as the 12th amendment in the deceased government servants rule 2021. Earlier this year, the Allahabad high court had maintained that excluding married daughters from the definition of “family” in the rules for appointment on compassionate grounds was “unconstitutional” and in violation of Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution. While hearing a petition in January, the high court held that a married daughter was “no less eligible” for government jobs on compassionate grounds than her married brother or unmarried sister. The court was hearing a petition by one Manjul Srivastava, who had challenged a June 2020 order of Prayagraj’s district basic education officer, rejecting her claim to the appointment on compassionate grounds following her father's death during his service to the state government. The state cabinet also approved the `Matrbhoomi Scheme’ allowing people, who have settled in bigger cities/abroad to contribute to the development of their native village. If a person is willing to bear 60% cost, government will contribute remaining 40%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-adds-married-daughters-in-dependents-list-for-govt-jobs/articleshow/87655663.cms||---

On Thursday, a letter was sent to the university vice-chancellor stating that the varsity should reply within 15 days informing whether any violation of norms had taken place, failing which UGC might withhold financial assistance to the varsity. According to the complaint, the university had given promotions to faculty members, who had retired between 2012 to 2020, which is against the UGC norms. Meena said the university administration had granted promotions in gross-negligence of the rules. "Despite raising objections, the university administration gave promotions to teachers retired between 2012-20. This is sheer violation of the norms. The UGC has written V-C many times before the promotions were granted. Now, if university grant is stopped, the administration will be responsible," said Meena. According to an estimate, Rajasthan University gets more than Rs 40 crore as financial aid from Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) every year. Higher education secretary Narain Lal Meena said he was not aware about the letter. "The letter wasn’t put up in front of me. I am aware of the earlier letter sent by the UGC to Rajasthan University, though. We had asked the university to follow the rules and regulations laid down. If this wasn’t done, we will look into it. However, I am yet to receive the latest letter," said Meena.

An official from the health department of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) said some of the vaccination sites were receiving a very low response. Such sites’ staffers would be diverted to door-to-door vaccination counselling and survey work. “In this process, some of the sites would be closed temporarily,” said the official. Suryakant Devkar, the chief immunization officer of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), told TOI that they had achieved 100% first dose vaccination, but they would make sure that the areas reporting low vaccination were surveyed because the “Har Ghar Dastak” drive was mandatory. “We shall not close a single vaccination site because at least 12 lakh beneficiaries would be eligible for the second dose in the last week of November and December. We shall, however, make sure that if any vaccination sites have extra staff members, they are allocated to the duty of ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ drive,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/staff-from-low-performing-vax-sites-in-har-ghar-dastak-drive/articleshow/87654506.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Sources in HAL said the work on the infrastructure required for immigration checkpoints started in November 2020, after a nod from the Union Home Ministry. The Bureau of Immigration, Mumbai, has guided HAL in setting up the facilities like separate sections for international arrivals and departures, customs office, immigration counters etc at the sensitive airport. HAL has segregated the domestic and international wings at the airport with separate entry/exit points at both wings. HAL sources added that the Bureau of Immigration will conduct a final inspection following which, the Union Home Ministry will formally announce making the immigration checkposts operational at the Nashik airport. This will pave way for the commencement of international flights directly from the airport. Airport officials said starting international flights from Nashik will ease the pressure on the Mumbai airport and would also benefit international passengers from north Maharashtra. There already is a seating capacity of 200 international passengers, and there is scope for further expansion at the terminal for international flights. The seating capacity will be increased as per the requirement. Local MP Hemant Godse said there is huge scope for direct Nashik to Jeddah flights for Haj pilgrims from Nashik and adjoining districts of north Maharashtra. At present, Haj pilgrims from Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon, Nandurbar and Ahmednagar have to travel to Mumbai to take flights to Jeddah. The Nashik airport has a 3.5km runway that can handle any large passenger or cargo aircraft. Nashik already has air connectivity to cities like New Delhi, Indore, Belagavi, Ahmedabad, Surat and Pune. Alliance Air, a subsidiary of Air India, and two other private airlines are operating flights from the airport. Manish Rawal, the chairperson of the aviation committee of the Ambad Industries and Manufacturers’ Association (AIMA), said this is a positive development. “The footfall of passengers for the domestic flights at the Nashik airport has increased. Making immigration facilities operational will boost international air connectivity as well,” said Rawal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-airport-prepares-infra-to-handle-international-flights/articleshow/87653068.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Delhi||VAT cut on fuel in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana hits Delhi sales||NEW DELHI: Petrol sales in Delhi have slumped by a quarter as vehicle owners in the country’s largest car market and hordes of daily commuters driving or riding into the capital for work from townships around the capital began flocking to outlets in UP and Haryana since these states slashed VAT after the Centre cut excise duty on November 3. More than a quarter of Delhi’s 403 petrol pumps located on or near the border in particular have seen a dramatic drop in sales as consumers were drawn to UP and Haryana where petrol became cheaper by more than Rs 8 a litre as the Arvind Kejriwal government is yet to reduce VAT. “About 115 petrol pumps in Delhi are near the border with UP and Haryana. These pumps have seen sales slide 50-60%. The pumps in areas such as trans-Yamuna are suffering more as UP is a bigger draw due to the wider gap with Delhi’s price and larger number of people driving into the city from townships near the capital,” All India Petroleum Dealers Association president Ajay Bansal told TOI. After the Centre cut excise duty on petrol by Rs 5 and diesel by Rs 10 per litre, the UP and Haryana governments reduced VAT to bring down the price of each fuel by Rs 12 a litre. Petrol in UP is now Rs 8.86 per litre cheaper than Delhi against Rs 3.36 a litre earlier. In Haryana, it costs Rs 8.22 a litre less than Delhi compared to Rs 2.43. Diesel, however, still remains cheaper by 8 paise a litre in Delhi than UP against 49 paise earlier; and 39 paise than Haryana compared to 8 paise before. Dealers said they have appealed to the Delhi chief minister to reduce VAT as the loss of sales will also reduce the state’s revenue collection. Sources said the CMO assured them that the government was examining the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vat-cut-on-fuel-in-up-haryana-hits-delhi-sales/articleshow/87654525.cms||Sanjay Dutta

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: All 9 add-on civic poll wards likely in suburbs||Mumbai: With the state government announcing that the number of electoral wards in the city will go up by 9, BMC officials have said that it is likely that the new wards will be added in the suburbs and the number of wards in the island city is unlikely to go up. According to officials, five wards may increase in the western suburbs and four in the eastern suburbs. Officials said that the population of the island city had not gone up while the population of the suburbs had seen a rise. There could however be a readjustment in ward boundaries and population in the island city. The last time that the number of electoral wards was increased in the city was in 2002, when the number of wards went up from 221 to 227. Mumbai is divided into two districts — city and suburban. “The average voters in each electoral ward is now around 54,000. Since the number of seats has increased by 9, the seats will go from 227 to 236. This means that the number of voters in each ward will be close to 51,000 and a 10% here and there. The population of Mumbai is around 1.24 crore. Once we get the orders from the state government, we will rework ward boundaries, keeping in mind the new average voters per ward and redraw the boundaries,” the official added. The total registered voters in Mumbai is 94.55 lakh as per the figures of 2019. Officials said that delimitation or redrawing of ward boundaries is done to balance voter population equally among wards. Officials said that as per the 2011 census, population growth in the suburbs and drop in the island city were taken into account while redrawing electoral wards. Each ward had a population of around 54,000. With a rise in nine seats, the average voting population in each ward will be around 50,000-51,000, according to officials. Election data analyst Hitesh Jain said that many wards in the island city had more than 60,000 population. “The average population should be around 50,000 but several electoral wards like 194, 199 and 198 in central Mumbai have over 60,000 population. There should be uniform population in all 236 wards. A 10% difference is fine but in some wards the population is 20% above or below average,” Jain said. Urban development minister Eknath Shinde had said that between the 2001 and 2011 census, population in BMC limits has increased by 3.87%. “We have begun the GIS mapping to ensure natural boundaries aren’t affected and will do a physical verification where required. This exercise may take around a fortnight,” said an official. Areas like Mulund, Bhandup, Powai, Vikhroli, Kanjurmarg, Andheri (west), Goregaon (west), Malad (west), Borivli-Dahisar are likely to see new wards due to rise in population. Officials said that the need for increase in the number of electoral wards may also be felt as some suburban wards have almost 18 corporators in one administrative ward. Despite the high number of corporators, the population in these wards has exponentially increased.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-all-9-add-on-civic-poll-wards-likely-in-suburbs/articleshow/87655703.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Though the renovation works started years ago are yet to be completed, the district administration decided to open the park so that the children in the city wouldn’t be deprived of recreation facilities any more. The park would be reopened in a simple function to be held on Sunday. “It is a happy news that the park would be opened. The authorities should take steps to reopen the renewable energy park attached to the children’s park,” said Renjith Thampi, an activist. “Earlier, there was a facility for imparting knowledge on traffic rules to the children. The authorities should resume that facility too,” he said. District collector Jafar Malik said that KEL, the contractor, has been asked to complete the renovation works at the earliest. “If we wait for completing the renovation works, children will lose the opportunity for recreation until then. That’s why we decided to reopen the park at the earliest. In the meantime, they can continue with the renovation works,” Malik said. Those associated with the park claim that the pandemic delayed the project. “Their claim is not true. The work should have been completed in May, 2019. It was months after the deadline for completion of the renovation works that the pandemic broke out,” said Ernakulam Vikasana Samithi president K S Dileep Kumar. “As the park remained closed for around four years, a generation of kids lost the opportunity to play in the park. Now, they all are teenagers and can’t use many of the facilities in the park anymore,” Kumar said. The renewable energy park adjacent to the children’s park is in a dilapidated condition. Undergrowth and rusting of toys have made the operations of the renewable energy park difficult. There are many flaws in the works which have already been completed as part of the renovation project of the children’s park. “We will give instructions for clearing the undergrowth in the renewable energy park by Sunday. We have asked the contractors to rectify the flaws in the already completed works,” Malik said. According to the officials with the park, delay in procuring toys from abroad and other parts of the country stands in the way of reopening of the renewable energy park. “The pandemic has caused difficulties in procuring toys. The companies which are to deliver such items face problems in manufacturing and transporting due to the issues stemming out of the Covid-19 pandemic. The train which is to replace the existing dilapidated one in the renewable energy park is expected to reach here within a week. Other items will also be delivered one after another,” an official with the children’s park said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/a-happy-childrens-day-awaits-city-kids/articleshow/87654535.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

The corporation has been conducting fever camps at the venues only after dengue fever clusters were reported. On November 1, Trichy district had reported seven dengue cases and 12 on November 10. Trichy city, Thiruverumbur, Manikandam and Manapparai have been identified as most vulnerable as per the report by the deputy director of health services office. “We are conducting fever camps in 36-38 locations per day in the city to identify cases. Penalties are being levied, the recent rains have aggravated the fever cases. The situation is under control,” a health official with the corporation said. There are 12 active fever clusters in wards 17, 19, 26 and 60 in Srirangam, Ariyamangalam and K Abishekapuram zones. The dengue fever caseload is 10-fold higher than the corresponding period last year, with 3-4 dengue cases being reported every day. Residents across Rockfort, Karumandapam, Palakkarai, Srirangam and Cantonment said that fogging mosquito repellent, an instant solution for mosquito menace, was missing in their respective vicinities even as the civic body promised the drive once in 15 days. “Already a couple of dengue fever cases were reported in our wards, but preventive measures are not visible,”said Vignesh Gunalan, a resident of Rockfort. As the penalisation drive against dengue sources found in houses and commercial places is not active, residents have been lackadaisical in even keeping their properties free from potential dengue source. In public places, coconut shells and plastic containers pose as dengue breeding sources as rainwater accumulates in them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/dengue-cases-on-the-rise-in-trichy-12-fever-clusters-in-city/articleshow/87655256.cms||Deepak Karthik

The inflow in the Koraiyar river has also come down, and the residential areas that were flooded by the river a few days ago expect the situation to improve further, provided there is no heavy rainfall on Friday. According to the PWD, the inflow in the Koraiyar as on Thursday night has come down to 2,000 cusecs. Till Thursday morning, the flow was gauged at 3,000 cusecs. Koraiyar collects surplus water from tanks in Pudukkottai district, and Manapparai, and carries rainwater from its catchment areas. It had flooded the residential neighbourhoods of Trichy city on November 8. Although rainfall is absent in the catchment area, the surplus tanks at Viralimalai and Keeranur are still discharging water into the Koraiyar, which runs towards Trichy city. Koraiyar ends its journey at the PWD aqueduct in Kuzhumayee Amman temple behind Trichy district collectorate. From there it starts its journey as the Kudamurutti river, which travels for six kilometres to merge with the Cauvery. “As there was no heavy rain in the city, the inundation has not worsened. We expect the water level to recede significantly by Friday evening,” a senior official with the PWD said. District collector S Sivarasu and Trichy Corporation officials inspected the inundated areas near Woraiyur. Drainage channels were repaired to discharge stagnant water to an extent in the city. Parts of Lingam Nagar, Kuzhumani, Ramalinga Nagar, Fathima Nagar and Karumandapam were still inundated with the surplus water from the Koraiyar and the Kudamurutti. At Mukkombu (upper anicut), the entire quantum of incoming water from Mettur dam was diverted to the Kollidam river. As the paddy fields in the delta were inundated, PWD said that further discharge of water in the Cauvery will be a disaster. Around 35,000 cusecs of water was discharged into Kollidam at Mukkombu barrage till Thursday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/rain-eases-in-trichy-floodwaters-recede-in-residential-areas/articleshow/87655258.cms||---

Police said that an FIR was registered in the case on Wednesday night after a team of the state child commission discovered the exploitation of young inmates by their seniors which included acts such as physical violence, sexual abuse and misconduct. As per the police, the commission found that as many as eight children had faced ordeal at the shelter. The complaint said that the children were subjected to sexual and physical violence by senior and former inmates. The FIR was filed under Section 377 (unnatural offences) of the IPC and other relevant sections under the protection of children from sexual offences (POCSO) act. “We are also investigating allegations of senior inmates drinking inside the shelter and abusing kids there,” said a senior official, adding that prima facie investigation pointed out gross misconduct inside the shelter. “It has to be probed how former inmates managed to frequently enter the shelter and if they were checked or not,” the official said, adding that more people are under the scanner in the case. Sources said that the commission’s team had also handed over videos saved in a pen drive to the police which purportedly showed ordeals faced by the kids. “The team of child commission had learned about major irregularities inside a private children shelter. They sent a team that discovered all these horrendous acts taking place there. Although the shelter is private, it is registered one and it appears that security was spotty,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sexual-abuse-at-shelter-home-two-minors-detained/articleshow/87655260.cms||---

A fire broke out in the intensive care unit of the hospital on November 6, killing 11 Covid-19 patients and injuring six. The state government then set up a team headed by Game to probe the incident. As part of the inquiry, Game and other members of the panel inspected the ICU on Thursday evening and spoke to hospital staff, including the now-suspended civil surgeon Dr Sunil Pokharna.

We have sent him a fresh set of questions and are awaiting his response. We will also speak to witnesses,” added Game. OPD and IPD services at more than 500 private hospitals and nursing homes across Ahmednagar remained shut on Thursday as a mark of protest against the arrests of a doctor and three nurses of the civil hospital.

Goa was earmarked two FTSCs, but the state gave its consent for just one. The consent of states is essential as FTSCs are part of a centrally sponsored scheme where both the Centre and the state chip in with funds. “As the pendency of such cases (that are to be tried in fast-track special courts) is not that much in Goa, the government decided to go in for just one fast-track special court,” Cabral told TOI. “The infrastructure for the court is ready. They now have to appoint a lady judge for the court as per the rules. We have already written to the high court for appointment of the judge.” After the passage of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act in 2018, the central government had decided to set up 1,023 fast track special courts (FTSCs), including 389 to deal exclusively with cases related to violation of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, in 31 states and Union territories. Against the total intended FTSCs, 674 including 367 Posco courts have been made operational in 27 states and UTs, and till August this year they have disposed of 56,267 cases despite the coronavirus-triggered lockdown. The Pocso Act, 2012 enacted by the government of India provides safeguards for children against sexual abuse. The Act provides for establishment of special courts for the purpose of ensuring speedy trial. Further, as per the Act, the evidence of the child shall be recorded within a period of thirty days of the special court taking cognisance of the offence and the special court shall complete the trial, as far as possible, within a period of one year from the date of taking cognisance of the offence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fast-track-court-for-hearing-pocso-cases-ready-cabral/articleshow/87654683.cms||---

A 24-year-old woman from LDA Colony (Kanpur Road) and a 32-year-old man from Phoolbagh in Hussainganj area, have tested positive for Zika. They were asymptomatic with no travel history prior to contracting the virus, which is spread by the dengue-causing Aedes Aegypti mosquito. Samples of four contact persons were taken by health department on Thursday night and anti-larval spray and fogging exercise conducted with the municipal corporation. Soon after Zika outbreak in Kanpur, chief medical officer's (CMO) team in Lucknow district had begun random sampling of fever patients coming to Lokbandhu Raj Narayan Combined Hospital, Balrampur Hospital and SPM Civil hospital. From November 3, more than 250 random samples were sent to King George's Medical University (KGMU) for tests. “Two patients tested positive, but they are asymptomatic. Their samples were collected at Lokbandhu hospital and Civil hospital between November 8 and 9, when they had mild fever,” said, district surveillance officer Dr Milind Vardhan. While the woman patient is in currently isolated in Lucknow, the male patient went to attend a wedding in Ambedkarnagar, before the test result was announced on Thursday. “The health team in Ambedkarnagar has been told to isolate the patient. It’s important to curb movements of Zika patients to avoid virus spread,” said Dr Vardhan. Since there is no specific treatment or vaccine available, only symptomatic treatment is administered, Dr Vardhan appealed to people to remove stagnant water that makes it conducive for mosquitoes to breed. “There is no need to panic since this is not a serious disease. Most are asymptomatic and very few symptomatic patients need hospitalisation. Mortality rate is almost negligible. But the virus is caused by the mosquito, which breeds in clear stagnant water mostly found around homes and gardens. People should regularly drain out stagnant water from coolers, from under the pots and tyres,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/zika-spreads-to-city-2-diagnosed-with-virus-isolated/articleshow/87655704.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Kochi||Ernakulam: The mantra of solving Rubik’s Cubes||KOCHI: If solving Rubik’s Cube was a passion for Sri Hamsika since the age of six, reciting Sanskrit slokas was part of her daily routine since a very young age. And these two habits of the seven-year-old girl from Ernakulam have won her a place in the Kalam Book of World Records and India Book of Records in 2021. The recognition was for performing dual activities simultaneously, as she has solved 15 Rubik’s Cubes while chanting 18 Sanskrit slokas in seven minutes and 12 seconds. Hamsika, who studies in Class II at Bhavan’s Adarsha Vidyalaya in Kakkanad, is the only child of Prince M D, a recruitment consultant in the city, and Radhika Ongole, a homemaker. Her parents said that her passion for slokas started with her listening to her grandmother Subhadra Ongole reciting them at the house. “She started learning the slokas from her grandmother and later studied new ones by watching TV. Rubik’s Cube was bought for her as a toy but slowly she started learning it with much passion. She researched in the internet about solving it and taught herself. Later on, she started studying the solving tricks of other variants of the cube and we bought them for her. Learning from YouTube videos, gradually she increased the speed of solving,” said Radhika. When the family noticed that she could solve the cubes even while chanting slokas, they decided to nurture her skills. Later they applied for the Kalam Book of World Records and India Book of Records and Hamsika set her records. The cubes she solved include, 3 by 3, 2 by 2, 4 by 4, pyramix, skewb, concave cube, rainbow ball, cylinder cube, clock, mirror cube, loppy cube, maple leaf and bead pyramix. “She solved each of the cubes at varying speed during the feat for the records. Now she is trying to improve her speed. She was felicitated at her school for the achievement,” Radhika said. Besides Hindi, English and Malayalam, Hamsika knows Telugu as her mother is a native of Andhra Pradesh. She is also good at drawing and painting and she had won several recognitions. Hamsika, who aims to become a paediatrician, is now working on a mosaic-portrait of former president late A P J Abdul Kalam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/the-mantra-of-solving-rubiks-cubes/articleshow/87654549.cms||---

The businessman named Mehul Bhuva told police that Anas Patel, Aarif Patel, Iqbal Patel, Noori Patel and Rahima Patel illegally entered the disputed land measuring 40,000 square feet on Vasna Road in October 2016. The accused started a food court on one part of the land while renting out another part for a furniture showroom. According to Bhuva’s complaint, one Mohammed Patel, who is related to the five accused, had transferred the disputed land to his name through his father’s forged will. Bhuva had lodged a civil case in the court here in 2009 when he learnt about it. The case is still going on, but the court has made an interim order to maintain the status quo of the land. As per the interim order, the land’s ownership and possession cannot be transferred to anyone until the court reaches the final judgement. Bhuva said that the five accused trespassed on to the disputed land and started commercial activities. Police said that Bhuva had submitted an application to the district collectorate to register a case under the Gujarat Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act. After hearing the case, district collector allowed registering an offence at Gotri police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/5-of-family-booked-for-land-grabbing/articleshow/87653967.cms||---

The minor, daughter of a migrant worker, was raped on October 12 in Sachin GIDC area and police arrested Nishad a day after he perpetrated the crime. Police had filed chargsheet within 10 days of the crime and the trial was completed within six days. Nishad, father of three children, abandoned the minor in bushes after brutalising her. Drenched in heavy rain, she was shivering when found. The court examined the evidence between October 26 to October 29.

---||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: Five held for murder of CPI man at Needamangalam||TIRUVARUR: Special police teams on Thursday arrested five people in connection with the murder of CPI Needamangalam union secretary Nadesa Thamizharvan at Needamangalam town in Tiruvarur district. Thamizharvan, a resident of Olimathi village, was hacked to death by a gang on Wednesday evening, while he was stepping out of his car at Needamangalam bazaar. The arrest comes within 24 hours after the occurrence of the crime. Police identified the accused as R Rajkumar, 33, J Manoj, 23, both natives of Agrahara Poovanur, M Madhavan, 23, of Surakudi Street in Padagacheri, B Sena alias Senapathi, 25, and A Ezhilarasan, 22, both from Thenpathi Street in Araiyur. During the investigation, it came to light that previous enmity between Thamizharvan and prime suspect Rajkumar was the reason for the murder. Rajkumar, a rogue, has criminal cases pending against him at Needamangalam police station. He was in prison in connection with a case and has come out on bail recently, police said. Rajkumar had a scuffle with one of his close relatives of the same village recently. Thamizharvan intervened in the issue and had taken the matter to Needamangalam police in support of the former’s relative. Based on the complaint, police had arrested Rajkumar along with his brother. Angered by the incident, Rajkumar had warned Thamizharvan of dire consequences, police said. Rajkumar came out on bail recently and executed the crime along with his accomplices. Following the incident, relatives and supporters of Thamizharvan damaged the windshields of a government bus and vandalized a few two-wheelers parked at Needamangalam forcing the traders to shut their shops on Wednesday. To avert any untoward incidents, around 800 police personnel have been deployed in and around Needamangaam bazaar since Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/five-held-for-murder-of-cpi-man-at-needamangalam/articleshow/87655259.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Congress high command will decide on cabinet reshuffle: Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot||JAIPUR: Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday said that the Congress high command will decide on cabinet reshuffle in the state. He was responding to the media after the meeting with Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi at 10 Janpath in New Delhi on Thursday. The meeting lasted for almost an hour. A day earlier, Gehlot had met AICC leaders Priyanka Gandhi, KC Venugopal and Ajay Maken in Delhi. After meeting Sonia, Gehlot said, “I have briefed the party's high command about the current situation in Rajasthan. Ajay Maken (state in-charge) knows everything as he keeps coming to the state. Now, the further decision (on cabinet rejig) is left to the high command. Whatever the high command says will be acceptable to all of us. I just want good governance to continue in the state.” He added that Maken would talk to Rahul Gandhi and Congress president and a final decision would be taken by the party high command based on those discussions. The expected cabinet expansion and reshuffle will set the roadmap for 2023 assembly elections in the state. A long brainstorming session was held between Gehlot and the central leadership for two days in Delhi. According to sources, Wednesday’s meeting was regarding the long-pending cabinet reshuffle in the state. “I believe that a lot of confusion has now been cleared and a future roadmap is being prepared,” Maken said. On Thursday in Dausa, Sachin Pilot said the decisions regarding cabinet expansion and other political appointments would be taken soon. The former deputy chief minister said the AICC and the state government were in constant touch over it as the panel that was formed by the party president over a year ago had completed its work. “I met (KC) Venugopal a couple of days ago. We continuously held discussions and soon decisions will be taken with regard to the organisation and the government,” he told reporters in Dausa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cong-high-command-will-decideon-cabinet-reshuffle-cm-gehlot/articleshow/87655274.cms||---

The four fell for an online cheating scam operated by a gang from Alwar in Rajasthan. Rahul Parmar, a software engineer, told police that he got in touch with a woman through an online dating application. Parmar initiated conversation through WhatsApp, but it later turned out that the woman’s profile was a fake one and it was being operated by four men. After initial messages on WhatsApp, Parmar made a video call to the woman. During the video call the woman’s face was covered. Meanwhile, the person on the other side of the call took a screenshot of the video call. Later, Parmar’s face, recorded during the video call, was morphed and used in a pornographic video. The video was then sent to Parmar and he was asked to pay Rs 5,000 through a payment application. Initially, Parmar transferred Rs 2,000 and before he could send the remaining amount, the four accused were arrested by Rajasthan police. Cops identified the four as Farooq Mev, Nahid Mev, Rahis Mev and Samayuddin Mev. “Three other persons have also been cheated by these four accused and we have taken their complaints as well,” said inspector M C Vala of Cybercrime police station. The three other victims are Parimal Lathigra, Ishit Patni and Subhash Ghodasar. “The gang has around 60 members and they used to extort money from people living in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Telangana and Tamil Nadu,” Vala added. Rajkot police will soon be taking the custody of the four accused from Alwar police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/software-engineer-falls-prey-to-online-fraud/articleshow/87653795.cms||---

Among those suspended on Thursday are 15 employees from Aurangabad division, shows official data. Maharashtra transport minister Anil Parab said several MSRTC employees were willing to resume work. “It has come to our notice that a section of agitating employees are stopping the others from rejoining their duties. I have spoken with the top police officials and sought police protection for those, who are willing to resume their work,” he said. Parab once again appealed to the staff to call off the strike considering the larger public interest. The MSRTC employees have struck work since last month demanding merger of the transport utility into the state government among other demands. Meanwhile, local unit of MNS on Thursday held a demonstration in support of agitating MSRTC staff. Stating that stand taken by the government to suspend agitating employees was unjust, MNS leader Ashok Pawar said the ruling party leaders must hold talks with the staff. “Some MSRTC staff have ended their lives in recent past due to financially poor health of the state transportation. The suspension of staff is now rubbing salt on the wounds of affected employees,” he said. Gathered in large numbers in front of the office of Aurangabad collector, MNS workers shouted slogans against the government during their protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/over-2000-msrtc-employees-suspended/articleshow/87653084.cms||---

The gradient here is so steep that it is nothing short of a test especially during peak hours. Looking at the amount of traffic passing through the Naranpura-Chandlodia section, the Railways had proposed a flyover or an underpass at the crossing. However, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation turned down the proposal, claiming that utility lines passing through the area prevented them from doing so. The Ahmedabad-Botad line has been commission through this area, and is expected to be ready by March. AMC officials said, “Utility lines, including drainage pipes, have been laid at the spot which makes building either an underpass or flyover non-feasible. The lines were laid a little above ground level and since roads run parallel to the track, our only option was to build a steep gradient,” said AMC officials. Traffic expert, Amit Khatri, termed the gradient “unsafe”. “It will be tough for commuters when the crossing is closed. The cars will roll back when the driver tries to move ahead. This will increase chances of an accident. People on two-wheelers will also find it hard to balance themselves on such a slope as the vehicle will roll back when stationary. If the vehicle rolls down the slpt, it could hit another vehicle driving past on the parallel road.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/safety-of-commuters-goes-off-track-at-this-crossing/articleshow/87654589.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Nepal to conduct census in Kalapani, may stoke border dispute again||PITHORAGARH: In what may lead to fresh stoking of tensions between India and Nepal, the Nepalese government is gearing up to conduct a census in the Kalapani region of Pithoragarh district over a year after it endorsed a new map that included Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as part of its territory. Nepal’s current census exercise, its 12th, began on November 11 and will end on November 25. Sources told TOI that the census is sought to be conducted in Gunji, Nabi and Kuti villages of Kalapani. They added that Nepal's central bureau of statistics, which is assigned the task, is exploring multiple ways to count population figures since it will not be possible to send teams to visit the villages. “In all likelihood, it will be an indirect census, in which the number of households will be counted using satellite imagery and other technology,” said a source. Another option under consideration is estimating the current population based on India’s census report of 2011. Nepal has no existing census data of the Kalapani region, though the neighbouring country claims that it conducted a survey here in 1961. The India-Nepal border row had sparked off in May last year after Union defence minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated a 74-km road stretching from Ghatiyabagar to Lipulekh Pass. Nepal had lodged a protest, alleging that the road passed through its territory. Subsequently, Nepalese parliament unanimously voted to amend the Constitution to update the country’s map to include the Kalapani as part of its territory. Meanwhile, calling the census exercise in Kalapani region a ‘political gimmick’ by Nepal, Sanam Nabiyal, gram pradhan of Nabi village, said, “The people of Nabi, Gunji and Kuti are Indian citizens and the region is a part of Indian territory. Nepal has no business conducting a census in this area.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/nepal-exploring-ways-to-conduct-census-in-kalapani-region-of-india-may-stoke-border-dispute-again/articleshow/87654571.cms||Prem Punetha

---||Chandigarh||Pros turn cold greens red hot with low scoring at Jeev tourney||Vikram Jit Singh / TNN Chandigarh: The Tricity's golfing fans were expecting defending champion Karandeep S Kochhar to be right on top of the leaderboard but while he disappointed them with a 72 to lie tied-50th, the apex position remained a family reserve. His cousin and Chandigarh lad Abhijit S Chadha, who got married on Sunday to former golf professional and Hero Ladies Tour winner, Ankita Tiwana, shot a blistering 64 to emerge as the joint leader with six-time international winner, Shiv Kapur, after the first round of the Rs 1.5 crore Tata Steel-PGTI Jeev Milkha Invitational at the Chandigarh Golf Club on Thursday. The scoreboard was painted red all over: A record number of 49 players were under-par for the opening round. A 4-under-par 68 could only ensure a top-10 position. Hot on the heels of the joint leaders was another international winner, Rashid Khan, who shot a 65. Khan has won previously at the CGC and narrowly lost a playoff at the Jeev Invitational in 2019 after shooting a record 20-under-par for the CGC. Tournament host Jeev has his task cut out for him: he has to go low on Friday to make it to the money-making weekend rounds as he shot a 75 on Thursday, which included three bogeys from the middle of the fairway as his iron play was not sharp after his long lay-off from the sport. Jeev has been missing the cut consistently on his home greens and were he to make it this time, it would be nothing short of a championship win of sorts for the legendary player! While Kapur was immaculate in his tee-to-green game finding 17 greens in regulation, Chadha was real hot with the putter requiring just 27 putts for the round. These included two monster 30-footers drained on holes 5 and 7. Chadha eagled the par-5 second hole. With such a high-quality field in contention, it is a long road ahead to the final six holes on Sunday. Kapur had shot a 65 at the Jeev Invitational in 2018 during the opening round to hold the joint lead then, too, but did not finish well thereafter. Chadha is eager for a win and is hoping his luck changes with a lady in his life. The long-hitting Chadha last won a championship in 2015. “The challenge over the next three days is going to be reading the greens, which have some mixed grasses and different grains, some patches here and there. The greens were soft and receptive overall, and played to about 9-9.5 on the stimpmeter. I understand that it had been raining late in September and October so course conditions were bound to be affected. The morning conditions are going to be influenced by the cold and dew on the grasses and roughs, while swirling winds high above makes it difficult to read the direction and speed of the breeze correctly,” Kapur told the TOI. “Jeev is like an older brother to me, so I always try my best to play this event. The event means a lot to Jeev after the passing away of his parents earlier this year. We are all here to support him. This tournament would also not be possible without the support of TAKE Sports. They have stood by the professionals even in tough times of COVID and economic turmoil,” added Kapur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pros-turn-cold-greens-red-hot-with-low-scoring-at-jeev-tourney/articleshow/87654574.cms||---
---||Goa||Recruitment process for IPHB caretakers to continue: High court||Panaji: The high court of Bombay at Goa on Wednesday declined to halt the recruitment process of psychiatric patient caretakers at the Institute of Psychiatry and Human Behaviour (IPHB), Bambolim. Advocate general Devidas Pangam informed the high court that the written test is scheduled on November 14 and the petitioners are contract employees. “It will not be proper to halt the recruitment process itself. As such, the applications are liable to be rejected. It is made clear that further recruitment process will be subject to the outcome of the petitions,” the high court stated. Nine psychiatric patient care attendants went to high court seeking quashing of the recruitment rules brought into force on September 23, 2021 and reframing those for the post of psychiatric patient caretaker so that the petitioners are eligible for being considered for appointment. The petitioners stated that the new rules were framed to keep them out of recruitment. The contract employees appointed in 2013 have had their contract of appointments renewed periodically without any break in service. The last contract is renewed on November 11, 2020 and expired on October 31, 2021. There are 28 employees employed on a contract basis to the post of patient care attendants, whose duty includes ensuring safety of patients and staff, assisting in physically controlling the violent and restless patients, maintaining strict vigil on patients and working under direction/instructions of nursing and medical staff. The post of 30 attendants came to be created in 2013 and submitted that the new rules introduced in 2021 are designed to eliminate the petitioners and others similarly placed even from applying for the post of patient care attendants. Advocate Vijay Palekar, representing the petitioners, submitted to the high court that while the 2013 recruitment rules prescribe VIIth pass and knowledge of Konkani as essential and having a good physique as desirable, the 2021 recruitment rules make it essential for one to have passed SSC examination from a recognised board/ institution or successfully completed the course conducted by a recognised industrial training institute. Further, candidates must possess minimum physical standards - male candidates- minimum height of 157 cms, chest unexpanded 80 cms and expanded 85 cms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/recruitment-process-for-iphb-caretakers-to-continue-high-court/articleshow/87654693.cms||---
---||Mumbai||3 Ulhas officials in dock for okay to bldgs while civic boss was on leave in Maharashtra||Ulhasnagar: Three senior officials of Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation have been issued show-cause notices for allegedly granting permission to construct several multi-storey buildings, including a 36-floor high-rise, while the civic chief was on leave earlier this year. The chief has ordered an enquiry. One of the three officials, additional commissioner Karuna Juikar, had been tasked with additional duty of handling ‘important work’ while commissioner Raja Dayanidhi was on leave for nine days in March-April, said civic sources. The sources added that Juikar had given approval for new building projects and also issued a commencement certificate to a part of a multi-storeyed project. “Work for which the The sanctions were given is not classified as ‘urgent work’,” said a source. The action has come after Shiv Sena corporator Bhullar Maharaj and former Sena corporator Vandana Patil complained to the civic chief that Juikar had, in his absence, granted permission for some “non-urgent” work. The former corporator said that Juikar, former town planner Anil Gurgule and junior engineer Parmeshwar Budage had hurriedly sanctioned the plan for the 36-floor high-rise just a day before the civic boss was slated to resume duty. Patil alleged that the sanction was given despite several violations in the project. “For one, the builder had diverted the flow of a nullah and the developer had not submitted the final environment clearance certificate,” said Patil. Maharaj, the other complainant, alleged that the three officials granted permission to the developer to build extra 10 floors despite a high-rise committee’s recommendation for only 26 floors. Gurgule, who retired as town planner, and Budage had in 2010 spent 105 days in jail for granting permission for several buildings in violation of norms. A senior civic official said that Gurgule, in his reply to the show-cause notice, has stated that all permissions given were in keeping with the law and has also declared that there was no financial transaction between the builder and them. Juikar and Budage are still to reply. Juikar refused to comment, saying she is on leave. Dr Dayanidhi too was unavailable for comment. The civic body’s public relations officer, Yuvraj Bhadane, confirmed that the commissioner has issued show-cause notices to the three officers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/3-ulhas-officials-in-dock-for-okay-to-bldgs-while-civic-boss-was-on-leave-in-maharashtra/articleshow/87655755.cms||Pradeep Gupta

More than 2,000 MSRTC staffers have been suspended across the state for participating in the strike. On Thursday, 15 workers from Kolhapur region were suspended. They were posted with the Radhanagari, Chandgad, Gadhinglaj and Ajara depots. Private bus operators demanded that the regional transport office allow their buses to park and pick passengers from MSRTC bus stands. Regional transport officer Deepak Patil said, “The state government has allowed private operators to charge 1.5 times the cost of MSRTC bus ticket. If any operator charges a higher fare, contact regional transport office at 0231-2663131 or send an email to mh09@mahatranscom.in.” There is a heavy police presence at MSRTC bus stands to maintain order and prevent clashes between MSRTC workers and private bus operators. Police have asked the workers to shift their agitation to outside the MSRTC bus stand premises, which the protesters ignored. On Thursday, BJP and a private bus operators’ association from Kolhapur backed the strike. Satishchandra Kamble, head of a private bus operators’ association, said, "The state government is putting pressure on us to give our buses for public transport, but our decision is final – we won't give a single bus. We are in support of the strike. We have demanded to be allowed to enter the bus stand premises, the way it is allowed in Goa and Kerala.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/15-msrtc-staffers-in-kolhapur-suspended-as-stir-continues/articleshow/87653114.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

In Malegaon, over a dozen people were injured, including 10 policemen. Two of the police personnel have been admitted at the hospital for treatment but their condition is stable, said the local police. The police have detained four persons in connection with the incident so far. In Nanded, eight policemen, including an additional superintendent of police, an inspector and six constables were injured. In addition to this, at least three vehicles were damaged in the stone pelting, while a two-wheeler was set on fire. Malegaon police said a large number of bandh supporters were returning after submitting a memorandum to the local administration. When they reached the new bus stand area of the textile town, they saw some shops open and started throwing stones at those outlets. DIG of Nashik Range, BG Shekhar Patil, told TOI that the police had a tough time in bringing the situation under control as the group members had become violent and kept on throwing stones at the policemen. “The police had to resort to mild lathi charge to bring the situation under control. There was tension in the area for about an hour. The situation is now under control,” added Patil. Nashik SP Sachin Patil said the protesters pelted stones at a building with shops at the basement and a hospital on the first and second floor. The stone pelting left some of the window panes of the hospital shattered. The DIG and the SP are camping in Malegaon. Nanded superintendent of police Pramodkumar Shewale told TOI that after giving a memorandum to tehsildar around 3pm, the gathering was dispersing, when some members tried to head towards the district collector’s office by passing through mixed localities but were stopped by policemen and officers. As a result, they started pelting stones, leaving policemen injured. The suspects have been booked at Itwara police station on the charges of attempt to murder, using criminal force to deter government employee from performing official duty, rioting, unlawful assembly. In addition, the suspects have also been charged with sections under the Criminal Amendment Act and Damage to Public Property Act. The injured officers include additional superintendent of police Nilesh More and Itwara police station inspector Sahebrao Narwada, while one constable suffered a fracture in his leg. Additional superintendent of police Vijay Kabade said though none of the policemen suffered any serious injuries, one constable has a fracture in the leg. He said, “The incident occurred when the gathering was returning home. The sudden stone pelting left the policemen injured and three police vehicles have been damanged.

Sanjiv More, the sub-divisional officer of Sillod taluka, said private bus operators have been asked to refrain from overcharging the tourists. “The tourists will have to pay the fares similar to MSRTC fares. Any complaint of overcharging will be dealt with strictness,” he said. The private vehicles will offer shuttle services on a 4 km route between Fardapur T-point and Ajanta Caves during the official visiting hours for the tourists. Moushami Kose, the regional manager of the MTDC said that the district administration is planning to operate 4 mini-buses at Ajanta Caves till the end of the MSRTC strike. These buses will replace the fleet of private vehicles pressed into services from Thursday. “Each mini-bus will have a seating capacity of 40 passengers. The arrangement has been discussed during a meeting with the Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan on Thursday,” she said. On Thursday, ToI carried a report highlighting hardships faced by scores of tourists at Ajanta Caves as the shuttle service continued to remain suspended due to the ongoing strike of MSRTC staffers. Listed as one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites, Ajanta Caves have witnessed the footfall of 9,748 tourists (9,675 Indian, 73 foreigners) during Diwali vacations between November 1 to November 8. Jaswant Singh, the founder president of the Aurangabad Tourism Development Foundation said, both the MTDC and the district administration should ensure that private buses operate in a smooth manner till the MSRTC strike ends.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-admin-mtdc-start-shuttle-service-for-ajanta-caves-with-pvt-vehicles/articleshow/87653118.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Goa||Four state hospitals get ‘LaQshya’ tag||Panaji: Goa Medical College & Hospital, Bambolim (GMC) along with Hospicio, Asilo and ID hospital, Ponda have obtained a certification under the Central scheme, Labour Room Quality Initiative (LaQshya) which aims to reduce Caesarean deliveries. A hospital with the certification is required to conduct an audit every month, and from here on every “non-normal” delivery has to be explained to the Union ministry of health and family welfare. The scheme targets to improve quality of care in labour rooms and maternity operation theatres across public health facilities. Also, GMC at regular intervals give updates to the Union ministry about the prevalent C-section rate. Associate professor, department of obstetrics and gynaecology Dr Ajit Nagarsenkar said that the emphasis has been on normal deliveries at GMC, however it is not always possible because it being a tertiary care hospital, it receives a lot of complicated cases referred by other hospitals. “Around 25 to 30% of our cases are referred by other hospitals. GMC’s C-section rate is 35% and it’s high because of difficult cases. However, every attempt is being made to reduce it.” “Obstetrics consultants from the department audit the C-section rate at regular intervals and suggest measures to reduce it. It is examined in which case Caesarean could have been avoided and what alternatives were available. It is not an exercise to penalise anybody, but to examine the options available so that the next time if a similar case is presented, an attempt can be made to avoid a C-section,” Nagarsenkar said. He said that the rate of C-sections began rising across the globe in 1996 and a peak was seen in 2011. Health authorities all over the world, but mainly from the US, intervened when the rate of C-sections started rising at an alarming rate. But reducing C-section will be a tough task as it entails requiring people to change their mindset, Nagarsenkar said. To make a delivery process a little bearable for mothers-to-be, in 2019, GMC introduced a new initiative, wherein a woman admitted to the hospital for a delivery is allowed one attendant in the labour room. The mother-to-be has to declare in advance who will be her attendant in the labour room. It could be her mother, a sister or a relative or any person who could be of help to her. The initiative was kept on hold due to the pandemic. Besides LaQshya, he said, “Suman is another scheme which aims to reduce maternal and infant mortality rates, and this will go a long way in helping bring down C-section rate if not directly, at least indirectly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/four-state-hospitals-get-laqshya-tag/articleshow/87654577.cms||---

In the video, which has gone viral, the man is heard purportedly saying that the family members were told that their patient was alive and put on a ventilator. However, one of them managed to get into the hospital ICU and found that the patient was lying dead with the machines shut. The clip also shows vacant chairs, indicating that no hospital staff was present in the area. Moradabad health department officials said the purported charges levelled in the video shall be probed. Authorities of Moradabad’s Bright Star Hospital have denied the allegations. Mukesh Kumar, chief operating officer (COO) of the private hospital, said, “Two critical patients, who were suffering from dengue, were admitted in the hospital with no pulse rate and no blood pressure. They were already critical and in such cases, survival is almost impossible. Thus, they succumbed to illness. We have been admitting around five to six critical dengue patients in the hospital every day.” The hospital was in the news a few months ago when 15 Covid patients had died within 24 hours, allegedly after the facility ran out of oxygen. Earlier on Tuesday, a ruckus was created at the hospital by the relatives of three dengue patients -- Indrapal (47) of Sambhal, Mini (22) of Katghar, Moradabad, and Usman (60) of Mundha Pandey -- who died within an hour. Their families had accused the hospital of medical negligence. At that time, the hospital authorities claimed that they were “critical”. A new twist was added to the issue when the video went viral on Thursday. Taking cognizance of the purported video, Dr M C Garg, chief medical officer (CMO), Moradabad, said, “The deputy CMO has been directed to take up an inquiry into the matter and provide an audit of the deaths.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/moradabads-pvt-hosp-accused-of-putting-dead-patient-on-ventilator-to-extort-money-from-family-probe-ordered/articleshow/87653805.cms||Maria Khan
---||Kolkata||Cracker ‘stock clearance’, loud music bring noise demon back||Kolkata: Chhath Puja became a Diwali firecracker stock clearance exercise on Thursday morning, defying the apex court order while the attempts of cops to rein in enthusiastic revellers ultimately proved inadequate. Apart from firecrackers, the use of blaring DJ music with every major Chhath procession left environmentalists peeved. The WBPCB officials admitted that crackers were burst indiscriminately across the city, more in south Kolkata and in the southern suburbs than in the north.  In all, 27.7kg banned crackers were seized since Wednesday and 153 people were prosecuted for trying to burst the illegal crackers. Though the apex court had fixed 6am to 8am window for the use of green fireworks on the occasion of Chhath, the bursting of banned chocolate bombs began around 4am. In most places, the crackers were burst in two phases — between 4am and 5.30am when the devotees made their way to the river and water bodies in processions to perform the rituals and again between 7.30am and 10am when the processions returned. The maximum violations were reported from the areas close to various water bodies across the city, both natural and artificial, where many devotees performed the rituals, instead of travelling to the river. Complaints poured in from the residents of Golf Garden, Tangra, Beliaghata, Kasba, Paddapukur, Ballygunge, Mukundapur, Survey Park and Burrabazar. “I had a tough time catching sleep last night. I tried to sandwich my ears with two pillows in vain. I was wondering about the relationship between Chhath and firecrackers. I was recollecting my childhood days when people used to worship the Sun God in a tranquil atmosphere,” said Subhas Datta, a green crusader. Datta observed that it was pointless to blame only the government and police. “Religious sentiments are tricky issues and community leaders must come forward to eliminate such excess from otherwise environment friendly rituals,” he added. Rajesh Sinha, a prominent leader of Bihari Samaj, said, “I have no information of bursting crackers during Chhath. I was there at the ghats of the Ganga and I found the most silent Chhath ever. But if Chhath revellers have burst crackers elsewhere in the city, I am condemning it. Those who burst firecrackers don't understand the significance of the festival. They are bringing a blot in the auspiciousness of Chhath by adding noise.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cracker-stock-clearance-loud-music-bring-noise-demon-back/articleshow/87654595.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Allahabad||Goods train derails in Jaunpur, traffic blocked on Lucknow-Varanasi rail route||Varanasi: At least 14 bogies of a goods train heading towards Varanasi from Lucknow derailed near Shri Krishna Nagar railway station in Jaunpur district at 7.57am on Thursday, blocking train traffic on the Lucknow-Varanasi route via Sultanpur. Hectic efforts were being made to repair the tracks, remove the damaged bodies and restore rail traffic, railway officials told TOI, adding that no injury or casualty was reported in the incident. Blocking of the route led to diversion of nine trains on up and down lines, while one train was short terminated and a passenger train was cancelled, said railway officials. “Following the derailment, several trains including Delhi-Varanasi Mahamana Express were stopped at different railway stations,” said additional divisional railway manager of Northern Railway (Varanasi) Ravi Chaturvedi on Thursday. He added, “DRM NR Lucknow Suresh Kumar Sapra and other senior officials had reached the incident site, where operations for clearing tracks for restoration of train movement had been started.” The goods trains with 59 empty bogies had left for Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Junction’s yard via Sultanpur, Jaunpur and Varanasi. While moving between Udpur Ghatampur and Shri Krishna Nagar railway station in Badlapur area of Jaunpur district, the derailment took place at 7.57am when it was changing track, said the officials, suspecting that the derailment occurred due to damage in railway track. The officials said that the actual cause of the derailment would become clear after proper investigation. As the bogies of this train started colliding with each other while derailing, hundreds of locals gathered near the incident site. The Shri Krishna Nagar station staff immediately alerted the neighbouring stations and senior officials about the incident, after which all trains moving on Lucknow-Sultanpur-Varanasi line were stopped at different railway stations. The Delhi-Varanasi Mahamana Express was also stopped near Sultanpur, the officials said, adding that its passengers were given snacks and the train was diverted on Pratapgarh route to reach Varanasi. Another train, 04264 Varanasi-Sultanpur, was shot terminated while 04263 SLN-BSB was short terminated, said officials adding, 02301 Shramjeevi Express and 045333 Barauni-Ambala Cantt Harihar Express, 04007 Raxaul-Anand Vihar Terminal and 02237 Begampura Express on up line were diverted on Pratapgarh route. Several trains on down line, including festival special trains, were also diverted on Pratapgarh route. Chaturvedi said that the process of removing the derailed bogies from the tracks and restoration of damaged tracks had been started. However, the officials could not confirm when the process of restoration of tracks would be completed to normalise the train movement on Varanasi-Sultan-Lucknow route.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/goods-train-derails-in-jaunpur-traffic-blocked-on-lucknow-varanasi-rail-route/articleshow/87654594.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Work on the Ahmedabad-Udaipur gauge conversion is also being run on war footing and expected to be complete soon. This will open up a new rail route to Delhi from Ahmedabad. Railway officials said that with some parts of the route to Delhi converted to double track the travel time by Ashram Express from Ahmedabad to Delhi has already been cut down by 2 hours and 10 minutes, from earlier 17 hours 30 minutes to the current 15 hours and 20 minutes. With the rest of the ongoing work completed, this time would drop to 14 hours and 30 minutes said a railways official. Currently, the Rajdhani takes 13 hours 35 minutes to reach Delhi from Ahmedabad. That time too will be shortened. Completion of electrification work will reduce the travel time further, said railway officials. “The track is likely to undergo inspection by March next year after which it will be commissioned for passenger traffic,” said a senior railways officer. He said the electrification being tested in Ajmer division will also be commissioned by the middle of next year. About the Ahmedabad-Udaipur-Delhi route, he said that travelling time to Udaipur, which is about 220-odd km will come down to four hours and then another 13 hours to go from Udaipur to Delhi via that route.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ahmedabad-delhi-rly-travel-to-be-much-quicker/articleshow/87654584.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Wake up kid! Play or lose life to obesity, says study||HYDERABAD: Being a couch potato was never good. It becomes decidedly problematic if you start early. That’s just what seems to be happening as a recent multi-city survey revealed that sedentary lifestyle was leading to obesity among children, with nearly 65% suffering from BMI (body mass index) issues. The medicine for these children of the digital age is a bitter one. No screen time for those below three years and only limited screen dose for those above three years is what experts recommend. Jack, surely, has to play, but not digitally. “About 8% girls and 9% boys were found to have high BP. And an average of 65% children have BMI-related issues,” says the study by a Hyderabadbased healthcare start-up ‘Healpha’. The survey screened 64,615 children from 3-18 years in Telangana, AP, TN, Karnataka and Maharashtra. While the study takes into account time before Covid, doctors say obesity and related issues spiked since pandemic. “There has been a rise in obesity cases in the last 18 months in children as young as 2-3 years old, particularly due to unhealthy eating and lack of physical activity. This has also increased diabetes among children aged 3-15. Hypertension seen in children is mostly secondary in nature, being related to renal, heart or hormonal issues,” said Dr Dinesh Kumar Chirla, director of intensive care services at Rainbow Children’s Hospitals. “Obesity is the main reason. Some between 10-15 years have BP of 170. In most cases, parents do not want medication at such a young age. Obesity is a vicious circle. The child often becomes aloof, gets depressed and gets even more hooked to junk food,” said Dr Manabendra Ghosh, a general physician from Tolichowki. Healpha founder Raj Janapareddy says, “Our tests showed that only 0.0018% children are in perfect health. This is alarming. It is a reality check for parents, teachers and government about the status of the future of India — our children.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/wake-up-kid-play-or-obesity-may-hound-your-future/articleshow/87654579.cms||Amrita Didyala

On the basis of a mobile phone handset seized from the spot, names of notorious teakwood smuggler Nandam Sevyam and his accomplices, Samaiyya Kalawa, Estari Ankayya Madem and Kishtiyya Venkaiyya Madem have come to fore. Forest officials have confirmed involvement of Nandam in teakwood smuggling. Police department has also claimed Nandam’s involvement in smuggling liquor which is banned in Gadchiroli. SP Ankit Goyal said that the police are trying to zero in on the assailants. Range forest officer (RFO), Sironcha, Shrinivas Katku said the Medigatta barrage check post was set up around a month ago to check movement of teakwood smugglers. “Earlier, the smugglers would ferry the woods across the river but they had shifted to surface transport after the Medigatta barrage road was opened,” said a source from Sironcha. There have been several skirmish between forest teams and teakwood smugglers at the state border in the past, but it is for the first time someone from the forest department has been killed. Around a couple of months ago, an officer of the ranks of assistant police inspector from Telangana, now working in state criminal investigation department (CID), was found allegedly involved in teakwood smuggling. It’s learnt , he had fled after threatening the forest guards with firearms. Gora had earned good reputation due to his work. The four assailants, identified as habitual teakwood smugglers, approached Gora while he was talking to someone over the cellphone. The assailants inquired whether he was Samaiyya. As soon as he replied in affirmative, one of the smugglers got down from the bike and stabbed him. Leaving a profusely bleeding Gora, the smugglers fled the spot. RFO Kaktu said Gora was rushed to Sironcha rural hospital from where he was referred to Hyderabad. “We have raised this check post couple of months ago to curb teakwood smuggling to neighbouring Telangana. The move blocked the key smuggling route of teakwood and fellers in the area are fuming over it,” said Katku. The RFO said the forest department has borne the expenses of treatment and have given ex-gratia aid to his family for funeral. “However, there is no provision of providing any kind of compensation to daily wage workers even if they died on duty,” said Katku. “We will try help his (Gora) family through personal contributions,” said the RFO. IFS officer Praveen Angusamy has tweeted about Sammaiya’s death giving a call for raising financial aid for his family through government or NGOs. While many vented their ire over norms that don’t provide for compensation to non-permanent staff, a few have offered to gather through crowdfunding. Meanwhile, Asaralli police have registered an offence of murder and launched a manhunt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/teakwood-smugglers-stab-forest-chowkidar-to-death-in-sironcha/articleshow/87655296.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

According to the copies of the minutes of the meeting accessed by TOI, the agenda of the meeting was to review the Parambikkulam-Aliyar agreement, Pandiyar-Punnapuzha scheme, Mullaperiyar dam and other allied interstate matters. In the meeting, responding to Tamil Nadu’s request for permission to cut the trees in the downstream of the baby dam, and repair the Ghat road, the principal secretary, forests and wildlife, Kerala informed him that the approvals are being processed. T K Jose, additional chief secretary, water resources department, expressed concern about the safety of the dam and stated that a new dam is the only solution to address the fears and concerns of the people living downstream of the existing dam. In response, the additional chief secretary, PWD, Tamil Nadu pointed out that the state is working within the ambit of the Supreme Court’s judgment and that the concerns of the people needs to be addressed. Besides, Jose, Rajesh Kumar Sinha, principal secretary forest and wildlife department, too had attended the meeting, along with other officials, conducted via video conference. In his letter, the chief wildlife warden has stated that the permission to cut the trees was issued after detailed discussions were held with the water resources department. "On 1-11-2021, principal secretary, F&WLD and wildlife warden met ACS, water resources department in his chamber and discussed the matter. ACS water resources department reiterated the necessity of granting tree felling permissions without any more delay, so that the present case in the SC could be defended properly,” said the letter. “...It is submitted that the permission for felling of 15 trees from approximately 40 cents of lease land area has been granted also based on the discussions at the level of ACS, water resources department and considering the stringent directions in the judgments of the SC and the ongoing hearings happening in the matter in the Supreme Court," said the letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/meeting-minutes-belie-govt-claim/articleshow/87654601.cms||Sandeep Thomas

Those privy to the action maintained that the premises belonging to a leading builder and others belonging to an industrialist in Aurangabad were searched. Sources said that the industrialist has multiple business interests ranging from construction, agriculture and sugar industry. The ED teams and the income tax department teams caught the staff at the locations by surprise. One of the staff member, who was allowed to step out of the office, said, “ED officials have seized mobile phones, laptops, computers and several files from the office and were screening them.” Sources have cited BJP’s Kirit Somaiya recent statement indicating about alleged money laundering in Marathwada region. Somaiya had also stated about lodging a complaint in this regard. Those privy to the searches claimed that it could be related to a Jalna sugar factory, which was purchased by the builder. The builder sold off his shares from the sugar factory to an industrialist. A complaint in this regard was lodged with the ED, which initiated a probe for money laundering and issued notices to the builder as well as the industrialist. “ED has been probing the two for money laundering for quite a while. On demand of ED, several sets of documents showing sugar factory related monetary transactions were submitted in the past few days,” said an employee of the builder. Along with this, separate ED teams were conducting searches in Maharashtra in connection with a money laundering case linked to alleged illegal sale of Waqf properties, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/ed-searches-at-multiple-locations-in-aurangabad/articleshow/87653138.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The panchayat has set December 31 at the deadline to make the panchayat clean and green, said sarpanch Girish Pillai. “Ours is second richest panchayat in the state, but the condition of the village is pathetic mainly because of garbage mismanagement. When I was the sarpanch previously, I had made attempts of solving the issue, but as the no-confidence was passed against me, and due to the pandemic, no work could be carried out.” After having meetings with villagers and environmental lovers, Pillai said that they learnt that garbage collection facility needs to improve as the contractor was not doing his job properly. Pillai requested the villagers to support the panchayat in its initiative and segregate the garbage at source before giving it to the garbage collectors. Pillai has asked the new contractor to clear the black spots in the panchayat jurisdiction. “The next big challenge is preventing people from dumping garbage and construction waste on the open. Such people will be dealt with strictly and action will be taken,” the sarpanch said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sancoale-panchayat-working-for-garbage-free-status-by-dec-31/articleshow/87654697.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A delegation from the National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) Goa, along with final year engineering students, met with the officiating registrar of the university, M Sreedharan, requesting that the pending results be declared by November 15. Questioning GU officials about the three month delay, NSUI-Goa president Naushad Chowdhari said students are left in a limbo due to it. “Engineering exams were concluded on August 16 and it has been almost three months, but the results are still pending.” Chowdhari said that as per rules and regulations of the university, results should be declared within eight weeks after the examinations. “Here the university is clearly violating its own rule of the ordinance which clearly indicates the pathetic situation GU is going through. It is sad that there is no one to address the students’ issue,” he said . NSUI further pointed out that the controller of examinations (CoE) is on leave, the registrar has not taken official charge yet and that there is no assistant registrar for professional courses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gu-must-pay-penalty-for-results-delay/articleshow/87654604.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Rs 35 lakh monthly bill for penguin exhibit upkeep||MUMBAI: With the BMC administration reviewing the Rs 15 crore tenders for maintenance of Byculla zoo’s penguin enclosure following sopposition from corporators, BMC has called for monthly tenders for penguin enclosure maintenance. It has floated a tender worth Rs 35 lakh to maintain the penguin enclosure for a month. Officials said the earlier maintenance contract had expired and BMC was awarding a monthly contract as the three-year tender was delayed after opposition corporators objected. The three-year tender is under administrative scrutiny. BMC will have to shell out around Rs 5 crore a year for three years to maintain the penguin enclosure. BMC had floated a tender of around Rs 15 crore for upkeep of penguins for three years. “The new tender is under process. The current contract for three years started in September 2018. This was a Rs 11.5 crore contract. The money will be spent on maintenance and air-conditioning of the penguin enclosure, life support and electrical system. It will also cover cost of veterinary staffers and supply of fish food for penguins,” the official said. The footfall of visitors at Byculla zoo rose around 30% after opening of penguin exhibit in March 2017 but income rose close to 500% as BMC hiked ticket prices that year. BMC claimed income at the zoo rose due to the penguins. BMC’s data stated there were 12.51 lakh visitors in 2015-16 and the zoo earned Rs 70.03 lakh in ticket sales. In 2017-2018, visitors were 17.57 lakh and income Rs 4.36 crore. In 2018-19, visitors fell to 12.70 lakh but income was Rs 5.42 crore. In 2019-20, there were 10.66 lakh visitors but the zoo earned Rs 4.57 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rs-35l-monthly-bill-for-penguin-exhibit-upkeep/articleshow/87655762.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Hyderabad||Covid deaths audit panel formed, says Telangana to high court||HYDERABAD: The state government on Thursday informed the Telangana high court that it has formed the deaths audit committee in relation to Covid-19 pandemic as directed by the Centre. State’s special counsel A Santhosh Kumar conveyed this to a bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A Rajasheker Reddy which was hearing a PIL filed by Congress leader Dasoju Sravan Kumar. The petitioner alleged the state government had been suppressing Covid-19 death figures. “The real figures would be much more than figures being shown by state,” he said. He sought a direction to the state to form the deaths audit committee immediately. “The kin of the deceased would become eligible to receive ex gratia of Rs 50,000 if the death is declared as one connected to Covid-19 infection,” he said. The state counsel furnished to court two GOs issued by the state on November 8 and 9, 2021. “We have formed the audit committee and GO No. 151 (dated November 8) and GO No. 1 (dated Nov 9) were issued notifying the same,” Santhosh said. He sought four weeks to file a counter. However, the petitioner’s counsel said GOs were not in tune with Centre’s guidelines. The bench said it was giving time to state to file its counter. It posted case to January 31, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-deaths-audit-panel-formed-t-to-hc/articleshow/87654599.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Kolkata||Kolkata traffic police to use disposable straws in breathalyzers||KOLKATA: Concerned over possible objections raised by motorists to undergo drink-driving tests, the Kolkata traffic police have issued a standard operating procedure (SOP) to all 25 traffic guards with details on how to carry out these tests. At the same time, Lalbazar has clarified that breathalyzer tests will be conducted only on motorists. Cops have been instructed to seize the vehicles if drivers and bikers are found drunk. TOI had reported on Tuesday and Wednesday about the return of breathalyzers after similar decisions were taken in Delhi and Chennai. According to the latest NCRB report of 2020, Kolkata, Delhi and Chennai have witnessed the maximum number of drink-driving accidents in the country. “Please resume breathalyzer tests to detect drink-driving. Only disposable (sealed and packed) straws will be used for conducting the tests. These straws will be disposed of in closed containers while the breathalyzer machines will be washed with sanitisers after use. OCs and additional OCs will personally ensure compliance with the instructions,” stated the order issued by DC (traffic), Arijit Sinha. “We are concerned about the spurt in drink-driving cases this winter. We had recorded 230 cases between October 1 and November 7. In the last two days (there was no checking on the day of Chhath), we have come across 29 cases. However, we are taking all precautions to stem the spread of Covid-19 while carrying out the tests,” said an officer. A sergeant from the traffic guard of an added area said, “Earlier, anyone could be asked to blow through the breathalyzer on the basis of a suspicion. But now it has been verbally communicated across the traffic guards that only those, who appear to be intoxicated, should be subjected to the test so that the number of people using the machine will be less.” Cops usually carry multiple pipes that are changed every time a person is tested, but as the number of tests goes up on weekends, the pipes were often washed for re-use in the pre-Covid period. “This has been banned forever,” said an officer. A new device was introduced in the beginning of last year that allows one to blow from a distance of around 5cm, instead of getting a pipe inside the mouth of an offender, said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-to-use-disposable-straws-in-breathalyzers/articleshow/87654614.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Ahmedabad||Railway line may derail traffic in Ahmedabad’s west||AHMEDABAD: The metre gauge line connecting the city to Botad is likely to derail the schedule of commuters using roads in the western parts of Ahmedabad, such as Navrangpura, Vijay Crossroads, and Naranpura. The rail line cuts through the city’s west. The railways is conducting trial runs and plans to commission the track by March 2022. The AMC has not made any provision for underpasses or overbridges to mitigate the effects of the track. Hence, traffic snarls are expected at the crossroads near the Navrangpura police station and other sites. Divisional railway manager, Bhavnagar, Manoj Goyal said that the inspection of the Ahmedabad-Botad track has been completed and the division is waiting to run a goods train on this section first. After the successful operation of the goods trains for 1.5 months, the railways will operate passenger trains on this track. “We expect permission to run the goods train shortly,” Goyal said. The newly laid Ahmedabad-Botad line passes through Naranpura, Navrangpura, Paldi, and Sarkhej among other places. A senior officer in the traffic consultative committee said that there are about 10 major crossings between the Sabarmati junction and Sarkhej. The officer said that traffic jams are likely at these spots. Before commencing work on the line in 2018-19, the railways had informed the AMC. The intimation was given so that the civic body could create underpasses and overbridges to deal with the anticipated traffic problems. The Ahmedabad-Botad line is further connected to Bhavnagar via Dhola. At present, the Bhavnagar-Bandra train takes the Bhavnagar-Dhola-Botad-Limbdi-Ahmedabad route. The 298km distance between Bhavnagar and Ahmedabad was covered in 5 hours and 50 minutes on the old route. The new route will cut the distance by at least 35km. A senior railway officer said that at least five mail and express trains and an equal number of goods trains are likely to pass through the city using the new track. This will mean that each crossing will be closed for nearly 10 minutes. “There could be more traffic jams than before at the railway crossings in the city. In all, there are 32 level crossings, big and small, along the Ahmedabad-Sarkhej route with no fewer than 16 between Sabarmati and Gandhigram railway stations,” the officer said. “Increased activity on this track will necessitate the stoppage of the city’s vehicular traffic more frequently.” The officer added: “Earlier, when citizens raised their voice against traffic jams, it was decided to terminate all metre gauge trains at the Gandhigram station instead of the Kalupur station.” Officials said that, in fact, goods trains from Bhavnagar will also be diverted to this line, which might take the total number of trains passing on the Ahmedabad-Botad track up to 12. Rajesh Shah, a resident of Navrangpura, said major problems are afoot. He said that in his area, one lane comes in from Mithakhali and another from the Navrangpura bus stand, forming a T-junction which is a traffic bottleneck. Shah said that road dividers may alleviate the problem. Ankit Patel, an Amdavadi who frequently uses this stretch, said that vehicles coming from Mithakhali and heading to Ashram Road contribute to the snarls. He said a one-way road in this section could ease the jams. He said commuters could take the road to the Navrangpura bus station to reach the Navrangpura police station. This will help the AMC smoothen the traffic on this junction, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rly-line-may-derail-traffic-in-citys-west/articleshow/87654624.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

According to forest officials, Mangat Singh, son of a farmer, had moved closer to the herd while taking their pictures when a tusker attacked him, killing him on the spot in Dalrajpur village of Nighasan area. This is the second incident within a month when a human was killed by a wild elephant. On October 11, a wild elephant had killed a youth while he was attempting to take a selfie with pachyderms in the Mohammadi range of the DTR. Officials said the herd had been camping in Dalrajpur and its neighbouring village Taparpurva since Monday and had destroyed standing sugarcane crop and banana trees in several acres. Meanwhile, a video has surfaced, showing an unidentified person opened fire at a tusker that had a narrow escape. The jumbo, however, went berserk, uprooting an electric pole and destroying sugarcane crop. Officials claimed that the video was shot before the tusker killed the youth. Deputy director, DTR (buffer), Anil Patel told TOI that they had sent a team to the village to monitor the situation. “We are trying to shoo away the herd into the wild. Besides, we will also investigate whether the bullet was fired in the air or aimed at the elephant.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/boy-17-trampled-to-death-by-wild-elephant-while-taking-pics-of-herd-on-mobile-phone-near-dtr/articleshow/87653832.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Officials said they can directly check if a water bottle has a fake ISI mark or not. “In the recent case, an official casually checked licence number on the BISCare app to see if the bottle was genuine or not and found that no such number existed,” said KV Rao, scientist and head, BIS Hyderabad branch. Rao added, “While we usually get tips off about such illegal activity from competitors, in interior areas such plants might go unnoticed. We request people to use BISCare app. They should lodge complaints in case a fake ISI mark is being used. This will avert major healthcare threats.” Manufacture, sale, storage and exhibition of packaged drinking water without valid BIS licence, use of BIS mark (ISI) without a valid licence are punishable under BIS Act 2016. “BIS licence is given to the manufacturing units only after thorough scrutiny of their manufacturing and testing facilities, and also hygienic conditions to be followed during its manufacture. Since maintenance of cleanliness and other aspects is a costly affair, most of the spurious manufacturing units do not seek licence,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bis-officials-to-raid-more-bottling-plants-soon/articleshow/87654612.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Pricier construction material, labour may push up realty rates||KOLKATA: Prices of apartments in Kolkata may go up by Rs 350-Rs 400 per sq ft, real estate developers said on Thursday, citing a sharp rise in the cost of construction materials and labour in the past year that had eroded margins. “Construction cost has gone up by 12% in the past 12 months while labour cost has increased by nearly 12%. The increase in fuel price has added to the material transportation cost. This has impacted our profitability as there is no escalation clause in the sale agreements. There is a need to review our selling prices to ensure that the business remains viable and companies stay healthy,” said Credai West Bengal president Sushil Mohta. In the past six months, several developers have already increased prices by Rs 175- Rs 200 per sq ft. A further hike will see the price escalating by Rs 525-Rs 600 per sq ft in less than two years. Though developers have been grumbling about rising costs, they have not been able to increase prices, fearing a slackening of demand in a depressed market. It is only in the past four months that demand has picked up, driven largely by the budgetary incentive of 2% reduction in stamp duty and 10% slash in circle rates announced by the state government. This appears to have given developers the confidence to talk about increasing prices. Credai Bengal president Nandu Belani said the price hike would only provide a much-needed breather to developers who have been battling multiple issues for the past several years, including migration to GST and Covid. “Unless something is done to reduce the input costs, price rise is inevitable. Project launches have been delayed due to this as developers don't want to incur more losses. In major material costs, we’ve seen a 45% increase in reinforced steel and 12% increase in ready mix concrete (RMC). That translates into an impact of Rs 122.8per sq ft on account of steel and Rs 41.2on account of RMC,” said Belani.  “The price of PVC that is used for plumbing has increased by 30-40%. Then there is a 10% rise in the cost of other metals and a 60% rise in the cost of sand. In addition, there is a huge increase in transportation cost due to fuel price hike. While plumbing material comes from Delhi, tiles and floors come from Gujarat and Rajasthan,” Belani added. While the average price rise is expected to be in the range of 10-12%, the affordable housing category will take the worst hit as construction cost is the highest component in this category of apartments unlike the premium of luxury units where cost of land is more than construction. “Projects that are launched henceforth and units in existing projects that are unsold will see prices rise in 2022,” said Siddharth Pansari, executive committee member at Credai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pricier-construction-material-labour-may-push-up-realty-rates/articleshow/87654635.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The incident was recorded on a CCTV camera. The boy, whose right hand is amputated, sells fish with his father to support his family. He alleged that the two policemen asked him to do some “illegal” work but he refused, which is why he was thrashed. The constables have been identified as Satyendra Singh and Naveen Malik. The incident took place in Bareilly’s Bithri Chainpur area on Wednesday evening. His father is yet to lodge a complaint with police. In the video, the two policemen were seen stopping the boy and later, one of them began kicking him while the other started hitting him with a baton. The boy was subsequently admitted to a community health centre. He claimed that the policemen first approached him and said he was “illegally selling fish”. Then, they told him to do some “illegal work” for them, for which they offered him “a share”. “I don’t know what illegal work they were talking about but I immediately refused.” SSP Sajwan told TOI, “The two constables had an argument with the boy over some issue and later retaliated by thrashing him. We will take appropriate action as the circle officer will investigate the matter and find out what exactly happened on that day. The boy has been admitted to hospital and he doesn’t have any serious injury. His family is satisfied with our action.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/moradabad-boy-14-with-amputated-limb-refuses-to-do-illegal-work-for-cops-thrashed/articleshow/87653840.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Hyderabad||Stop taking beyond your share in APIDC, says Telangana high court to Andhra Pradesh||HYDERABAD: The Telangana HC has asked AP government not to withdraw money from joint account of Andhra Pradesh Industrial Development Corporation Limited (APIDC) beyond its entitlement. A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A Rajasheker Reddy said this while hearing a petition filed by Telangana State Industrial Development Corporation (TSIDC) charging AP with withdrawing more money than its entitlement. Telangana special counsel A Sanjiv Kumar said AP had taken advantage of the fact that the common accounts were still lying in the name of APIDC and had withdrawn Rs 70 crore so far. “This is Rs 6 crore more than its share,” he said. AP counsel informed the court that both states could withdraw money in the ratio of 58:42 from the common account. Both the advocates brought to the notice of the court the judgment delivered by the Supreme Court in the AP State Higher Education Council versus Union of India case wherein the apex court directed the twin states to share the common corpus fund in institutions that were not yet completely divided in the ratio of 58:42. AP claimed that it did not withdraw money beyond its share. Sanjiv charged AP with diverting fixed deposits money into the current account and withdrawing cash from there. “We have already lost more than Rs 6 crore from the common corpus fund of the corporation and any delay in restraining AP would result in more loss to us,” he said. AP advocate general S Sriram, however, denied this allegation and said that their withdrawal was very much within the share they were entitled to. The case was posted to January 3, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/stop-taking-beyond-yourshare-in-apidc-hc-to-ap/articleshow/87654640.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

Putting forward his case before Justice Shameem Akther, senior counsel T Niranjan Reddy said that Vadarevu and Nizampatnam Industrial Corridor Project is a viable project. It would have converted the region into an economic hub by now had the project been allowed to come up, he said. A PIL was filed against YS Jagan Mohan Reddy in the high court seeking a CBI probe against him and his assets. The high court had ordered a probe with a rider that none of the genuine investors should be harassed, the counsel said. But the CBI did precisely that and implicated Nimmagadda Prasad in the case without explaining why it chose to make him an accused ignoring the HC directive. “CBI charged us with conniving with bureaucrats and misleading the cabinet,” he said, adding that this was an irrational allegation because the project was planned as a government to government project and an MoU was signed between AP and Ras Al Khaima, one of the seven emirates of the UAE, he said. State did not suffer financial loss in case because it did not invest anything in project, he said. Hearing in the case would be resumed on November 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nimmagadda-seeks-relief-in-cbi-case/articleshow/87654659.cms||---

The villagers were crossing the river in a boat to harvest sugarcane. Several villagers who witnessed the scene and knew swimming, saved the villagers from drowning. Meanwhile, police teams also arrived and two people were taken to hospital. The injured were identified as Omprakash (50) from Rajarampur and Radha Kumari (18) from Daibalgarh. They are recovering and said to be out of danger. Anil Kumar from Chahadwala village, who was part of this risky journey, told TOI "We have to cross Ganga every day to fetch our crop and fodder for cattle. On Thursday morning, we were travelling in a boat. When we reached the middle of the river, swift water rocked our boat. The current was so swift, we almost started drowning. Some of us were good at swimming and villagers also reached the spot. All of us were rescued timely.” Talking to TOI, Bijnor superintendent of police Dharamveer Singh said, "All villagers were rescued. Fortunately, there was no casualty." According to villagers, after long agitation by villagers from 25 villages, a pontoon bridge was erected on Ganga for fetching crops across the river. It was opened by the irrigation department in monsoon season. Sugarcane crushing season is set in but a bridge has not been erected as of now. Villagers are compelled to take boats to haul their crop from khadar areas. Notably, on August 24, 2018, due to the lack of a bridge, a boat was submerged in the Ganges leading to the death of ten women. On being contacted, Bijnor Tahsildar said, "The bridge is erected here by the irrigation department. This time the bridge was not erected due to high-water level in Ganges following unseasonal rain in October. We are trying our best to resolve the problem."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/boat-capsizes-in-ganga-all-rescued/articleshow/87653857.cms||Harveer Dabas

Vyas’s body was never found. Both the accused, Khushi Sahjwani (46) and Siddesh Tamhankar (42), pleaded not guilty, paving the way for the trial to commence against them. The maximum punishment attracted in the case is the death sentence. Vyas, a resident of Grant Road who worked for BBlunt Salon in Andheri, went missing on March 16, 2018. The alleged couple was arrested in connection with the murder on May 5, 2018. A police inquiry unearthed that the duo allegedly dumped her body at Mahul. A prolonged search for the body did not yield results. While Sahjwani, mother to a teenage son, was granted bail by the Supreme Court on July 2 this year, Tamhankar is still in jail. His repeated pleas for bail have been rejected by the court. While granting Sahjwani bail, the apex court had said, “Considering the fact that the petitioner is a female undertrial prisoner, who has been in custody for more than three years...and considering the family situation of the petitioner, the petitioner is directed to be released on bail...” The court also noted the chargesheet was submitted in July 2018. During Thursday’s proceedings before the sessions court, the duo initially refused to sign their respective pleas. Later, Sahjwani filed an application through her advocate Wahab Khan stating she be permitted to sign the plea with an undertaking that she would cooperate for the smooth and day-to-day progress of the trial. The court allowed her plea. The court said since Tamhankar has been in jail for over three years, the prosecution should take every step to begin the trial and examine witnesses as early as possible. It adjourned the matter to Friday. The chargesheet said Vyas was killed as the duo feared she would blow the lid off their illicit relationship. It was further alleged Tamhankar, a Parel resident, was also afraid he would lose his job as Vyas had given him a memo and March 16, the day she went missing, was the last day of the notice. Cops submitted forensic reports and said circumstantial evidence supported their theory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-years-on-charges-framed-against-murdered-salon-execs-2-colleagues/articleshow/87655771.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The state public health department data shows that as on November 7, over 16.90 lakh people in Vidarbha had taken their first dose more than 84 days ago and are yet to take the second dose. In case of Covaxin, 6.67 lakh beneficiaries are due for their second jab. At the renewed pace of vaccination, it will take an approximately 40 or more days to complete the second doses. This is based on the assumption that over 60,000 second doses would be given each day. On Wednesday and Thursday, the 11 districts of Vidarbha recorded over 1 lakh jabs, including 60% second doses. Individually, each district’s pace and time it will take to administer the second due dose may vary depending on its backlog. The completion of the second doses due as on November 7 will take the fully vaccinated percentage to 36% by December 1. The region’s revised target stands at 1.81 crore. Of this, over 1.23 crore have received at least on dose and around 31% remain to get the first shot. The second dose backlog is higher in Nagpur division at 14.34 lakh while in Amravati division it is 9.22 lakh. A higher figure for second dose due indicates that more number of people have been partially vaccinated in that particular district. Amravati division has over 40 lakh unvaccinated eligible people as compared to Nagpur’s 17 lakh. Amravati district alone has 10 lakh eligible persons who are yet to take their first dose. At 5.83lakh, Nagpur district has highest number of beneficiaries who are due for second dose. Yavatmal district under Amravati division has the highest number of beneficiaries at 2.4 lakh who are yet to take their second dose. After the central and state governments pulled up local administrations, Amravati divisional commissioner Piyush Singh has instructed each district to achieve a daily target. Districts under Nagpur division have taken their own unique decisions to ramp up the figures. The measures have to a certain extent yielded good results with daily vaccination in Vidarbha crossing 1 lakh mark on Wednesday and Thursday. Ahead of Diwali festival, the daily vaccination had dropped to under 10,000 in the region. All districts have been asked to complete at least first dose of eligible person by November 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/23-57l-due-for-second-dose-in-vidarbha-may-take-40-days-to-be-jabbed/articleshow/87655335.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Coimbatore||Coir pith industries get pollutingtag, come under strict norms||Coimbatore: The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) has shifted coir pith units to orange from the white category, forcing the units to follow stricter pollution control norms to curb water and air pollution.Industries are colour-coded - red, orange, green and white - based on their pollution emission levels, with white being the least polluting category.The order to bring the units under orange category was issued on Wednesday. The units should use only closed shed and impervious platform to store, process and clean pith to avoid polluting groundwater. Sun drying cannot be done directly on land and instead, cement platforms should be used. Mechanical drying options should be explored. Wastewater generated from the units should be recycled using effluent treatment plants to meet the quality prescribed by the board. The treated water should be recycled. To mitigate dust emission, the unit should install windnet arrestors along the boundary. Green belt should be set up to control dust emission. The units should adhere to the ambient air quality/emission standards prescribed by the board.While environmentalists and farmers owning lands adjacent to coir pith units welcomed the decision, it did not go well with the owners of the units. “The decision will also affect coconut farmers, who get Rs 2 to Rs 2.50 for every coconut husk. If the industry doesn’t do well, the farmers stand losing the income,” owner of a unit said.Malaipalayam-based farmer A Thiyagarajan welcomed the order. “It was a long-pending demand. We thank the chief minister and environment minister who solved the issue for the benefit of farmers,” he said.Coir Board member S K Gowthaman said that coir pith industries cannot survive if strict regulations are implemented. He appealed to the CM not to implement the guidelines. “The regulations will affect industries in Tamil Nadu and benefit industries in neighbouring states,” he added.There are over 7,000 coir pith units in the state and 2,000 in Coimbatore, thanks to widespread coconut cultivation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/coir-pith-industries-get-pollutingtag-come-under-strict-norms/articleshow/87655330.cms||V Devanathan

---||Meerut||Five ‘CID sleuths’ extort lakhs from medical store owners||Meerut: The five people moved in 'govt vehicles', carried walkie talkies and flashed ID cards of premier investigative agencies. For months they watched a popular TV serial on crime and rehearsed the jargon and body language of actors enacting the role of detectives. No wonder their 'raids' faced little resistance from an indefinite number of medical store owners they extorted in lieu of 'turning a blind eye.' But a raid on Baghpat based medical store proved to be their undoing when police were informed. All five in the age-group of 30-35 were arrested. Elaborating upon the modus operandi, investigation officer Yogesh Giri said, "Medical stores were an easy target for them. They would send a decoy customer who asked for a banned oxytocin injection illegally used to increase milk production among cattle. Any store that stocked it would be raided." "Ankush Singh and Anil Kumar from Ghaziabad, Yameen Khan from Delhi and two other women were part of the scam. We have recovered three CID IDs, Rs 35k and a walkie talkie from them. It has come to light they had been blackmailing medical owners in many districts of West UP", said Neeraj Jadaun SP Baghpat. Revealing further details investigation officer Giri said, "Some of the cases that have come to light are extortion of Rs 85k from a medical store in Shamli, Rs 2 lakh from Loni in Ghaziabad, Rs 50k from another store in Ghaziabad Rs 1 lakh from GTB Nagar in Delhi, Rs 2 lakh from Balaini in Baghpat and latest Rs 35k from a medical store in Khekhra whose owner informed the police." According to sources the five have been booked under IPC sections 420 (cheating), 471 (forgery), 384 (extortion), etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/five-cid-sleuths-extort-lakhs-from-medical-store-owners/articleshow/87653880.cms||Sandeep Rai

In her police complaint, Neha Prashar, chief manager, SBI, said that a person identified as Gulab Singh, who worked as clerk-cum-cashier at the treasury branch of Chandimandir bank branch, took a loan of Rs 1.50 lakh on March 21, 1996, of 240 installments of Rs 835 each. The bank official stated that Gulab Singh again applied for a bank loan of Rs 90,000 on July 9, 1996, which was to be paid in 180 installments of Rs 1,500 each. The loans were given by the bank on the 10 Marla land he owned. However, Gulab Singh did not pay installments regularly. Despite various notices, he failed to pay the loan amount.

Experts suggest that a system must be in place to limit paddy production to water-stagnant areas. There is no such data at the moment. However, it is believed that approximately 20 lakh acres is suitable only for paddy cultivation in the state. “It is not easy to start converting the land for cultivation of non-paddy crops where paddy has been grown for more than five to ten years,” Kanneganti Ravi of Rythu Swarajya Vedika said. It will take at least two or three years for land parcels to do better soil management which needs some investment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-system-tolimit-paddyproduction/articleshow/87654681.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Rathod was the handler of accused Jollu Naveen. When Rathod was asked who took the decision to not handcuff despite the accused being taken out of the guest house to an open field in pitch dark at 3.30am, the cop named investigating officer (IO) and Shadnagar ACP V Surender and said he did not give any order. Rathod said that the articles of Disha were under the soil, with a stone and stick placed on top. The constable also stated that none of the cops told Arif to dig after he pointed out the spot in the field at Chattanpally on December 6, 2019. The escape attempt was allegedly put in motion by Arif, who was the first to attack, according to cops. The constable further said that he was holding Jollu Naveen’s left hand and the accused threw soil with his right into his eyes. “Naveen also threw stones at me and I dodged them. One of them hit SI Venkateshwarulu. I rubbed the hand of the SI, who was bleeding from forehead, as that was the only first-aid I knew. I did not give any first-aid to the other injured cop, Aravindh Goud,” Rathod said. Quizzed about why his statement to the encounter case IO J Surender Reddy was silent on finding the articles on the fifth bund, while the same was mentioned in his affidavit furnished before the commission, Rathod said, “I had told him. He did not reduce my statement into writing in my presence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/accused-were-not-handcuffed-as-io-did-not-give-any-order-cop/articleshow/87654677.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Coimbatore||Kinathukadavu farmers upbeat as water released to Kothavadi lake||COIMBATORE: Farmers of Kothavadi in Kinathukadavu taluk and nearby villages are upbeat as water has been released to Kothavadi lake after three years. Water from Thirumoorthy hill used to feed the lake, which has shrunk and spreads across 150 acres. After several check dams were constructed in the stream, water rarely reached the lake. It has been more than 20 years since the lake reached its full capacity, locals said. A year ago, locals and activists joined hands to form Kothavadi lake restoration committee to restore the lake by strengthening its bunds. They started doing it manually on weekends with the help of a private firm that offered corporate social responsibility fund for the initiative. With the Thirumoorthy dam’s catchment areas receiving copious rain this year, villagers urged authorities to fill the lake using water from the Parambikulam-Aliyar Project channel. Pollachi MP K Shanmugasundaram took up the issue and got approval to release water to the water body. Water is expected to reach the lake on Friday, Kothavadi village panchayat president K R Rathinasamy said. “Officials concerned have promised to supply water till the lake is filled to the brim. It will benefit thousands of acres of land directly and indirectly,” he told TOI. S Sivaraja of Kousika Neerkarangal Team, which provided technical expertise for lake restoration, urged the government to issue an order to release water to the lake regularly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/kinathukadavu-farmers-upbeat-as-water-released-to-kothavadi-lake/articleshow/87655322.cms||---

The SP leader while addressing the people at the Kashyap Sammelan in Budhana, launched a scathing attack on CM Yogi Adityanath. Referring to the latter's recent poll speech in Kairana, Akhilesh said, "Recently, the chief minister came here and said exodus had taken place. But the reality is that had it not been Baba's exodus from Uttarakhand, UP's five years wouldn't be wasted." Speaking on three contentious farm laws and unemployment, he said, "The government has been repeatedly insulting the farmers. These laws will give a free hand to big businessmen to capture your farm land. They (government) do not talk about employment because it brings people together, while they are people who spread hate among the communities." Attacking the government on the state's health services, Akhilesh said, "We had launched '108' to call an ambulance at your doorstep and that service was being used during Covid-19 outbreak, but the government had failed to provide treatment during the pandemic. If oxygen had been provided properly, many lives could have been saved." Reminding Gorakhpur "encounter" incident, the SP chief said, "The state government has adopted a 'thoko' policy. Baba claims law and order are okay in the state, but he should tell us if there is any place in the country where cops commit murder."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/no-possibility-of-any-alliance-with-aimim-for-up-polls-says-akhilesh/articleshow/87653888.cms||Mohd Dilshad

A total of 86 farmers from Shiye village have given no objection certificate (NOC) to the district collector for land acquisition. Pandurang Patil, the head of Shiye Tantamukt Samiti said, “If the government gives five times the land acquisition cost, then the villagers from Shiye are ready to give the land. The decision was made in the meeting of the villagers and the no objection certificate has been given to district collector, guardian minister, member of parliament, MLA and road development authority. Tanaji Patil, the former sarpanch of Bhuyewadi, said, “Agricultural land from Bhuyewadi village will be acquired for the proposed construction of the Nagpur-Ratnagiri National Highway. Road development is also needed. Therefore, there is no objection for land acquisition from Gat no. 151 and 152 in Bhuyewadi. But the land acquisition charges set by the government vary as per the ready reckoner rates of the land, which is not feasible for all. Hence, the government should give us five times land cost for all the farmers whose land will be acquired. Also the highway authority should ensure that the farmers and villagers face minimum loss in land acquisition for the proposed highway".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/residents-of-2-villages-demand-5-times-land-acquisition-cost/articleshow/87653183.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

During his deposition for the second consecutive day, Janakiram on Thursday said that he did not state that he saw pistols in the hands of Arif and Chennakeshavulu after the exchange of fire at Chattanpally encounter site and his 161 CrPC statement, recorded by investigating officer (IO) J Surender Reddy, was wrong to that effect. Answering a question from the commission on why he did not tell IO about the pistols, Janakiram said that due to fear he did not inform the IO that his statement was incorrectly recorded. “I was scared to death by the incident because it was the first time such a thing occurred to me. I would have died in it,” he added. Janakiram also said that he had not recovered from the fear even 12 hours after the incident when the IO recorded the statement later that day. Janakiram stated that Arif picked up soil from the fifth bund and threw it in his eyes and when he tried to catch him, the accused pushed him away, subsequently throwing soil in the direction of CI K Narasimha Reddy and other members of the police party. When the commission’s advocate said that in his affidavit, filed before the commission, it was stated that Arif first pushed him and then picked up the soil, Janakiram replied, “I had told my advocate but he said that the order of the events did not matter.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/shooting-scared-me-to-death-constable/articleshow/87654685.cms||Mahesh Buddi

BJP has stayed out of the contest, while Congress too skipped as it didn’t have the numbers. Eighteen nominations — 11 TRS and & 7 AIMIM — were received for the 15-member committee, according to a release from the GHMC commissioner’s office. The election on November 20 may end up becoming a unanimous affair if the two friendly parties, TRS and AIMIM, come to an understanding. “In that case there would be 8 from TRS and 7 from AIMIM in the Standing Committee comprising 15 members,” an analyst said. The last date of withdrawal of nominations is November 15. Of the 150 GHMC wards, 56 are from TRS, 47 from BJP, 44 from AIMIM and 3 from Congress. With the BJP deciding not to make a contest out of the Standing Committee elections despite its stupendous show in the GHMC polls, its Malkajgiri ward corporator Vurapalli Sravan said that the party high command would clarify on the reasons in a couple of days. The political temperature in the city and the state has been high since the BJP’s bypoll win in Huzurabad.

Aged 11 and 12 years respectively, the duo will renounce the world in February 2022 and accept monkhood. Both underwent rigorous training of over two and half years and have walked for more than 700kms before they were chosen for diksha. Twelve-year-old Aanshi Shah, daughter of billionaire diamantaire in the city, had quit studies when she was eight only. The minor girl had developed interest in becoming a monk from a very tender age and started spending time with Jain monks at different places. Aanshi has also walked several kilometres with other monks and has also undergone the rigorous 30-day fast as well. “I have enjoyed life. But I find real happiness, peace and unity with the monks. Hence, I decided to join them for the rest of my life,” Aanshi told TOI. However, while she prepares to renounce the materialistic world, her father, Dipak Shah, wants to give his daughter the joys of the world before she accepts the colourless life. Shah will take Aanshi to Dubai. “I wish to take her once on a foreign trip. I feel proud that my daughter has been chosen to become a monk,” he said. Aanshi will take diksha under guidance of Gunratnasurishwarji Maharaj and Rashmiratnasurishwarji Maharaj. Meanwhile, her friend Viha Shah (11) was very categorical when she announced her decision to adopt monkhood to her her parents. She was clear that she will take diksha this year, though the parents persuaded her to delay it for a few years more till she grows older. Along with Viha, her father Shravak (45) and mother Sonal (43) too will renounce the world on the same day. “My son Kshama Shraman Vijayji Maharaj, now 18, took diksha when he was 13. He is an inspiration for all of us. We all have lived a materialistic life and wish to follow my son now,” said Sonal. Viha, who loves to click and post photos on Instagram, passed several tough tests before being approved for diksha. Shravak was working in a diamond unit but had to quit job to prepare for Diksha and started following strict routines as per the guidance of senior monks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/two-friends-set-to-take-diksha-in-surat/articleshow/87654169.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

Later, he agreed to perform the ‘nikah’ only after the groom’s family apologized for their conduct. The high-voltage drama lasted for nearly two hours. Marriage of the son of a businessman hailing from Talaq Mahal area was to be solemnised with a girl of Jajmau area on Tuesday. A band accompanied the marriage procession and there were fireworks too. “When the procession reached the marriage venue, the DJ -band started playing and there were fireworks which upset shahar qazi Maulana Mushtaq Mushahidi and he refused to conduct the marriage. The matter reached the senior members of the area, who made the groom’s family and guests, who danced to the DJ music, apologise,” said sources. The Qazi said, “Band-DJ and fireworks are un-Islamic, besides it’s also sheer wastage of money. After hours of apology, I agreed to conduct the nikah. Wherever such an instance will occur, I would not conduct marriage.” To recall, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board had released a new nikahnama for the Muslims in the country that banned series of ceremonies in March 2021. The 11-point nikahnama restricted the Muslim community from having ceremonies like ‘manjha’ (haldi ceremony) and other “un-Islamic” traditions like marriage procession, DJ, dancing, fireworks and dowry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/qazi-objects-to-dj-fireworks-refuses-to-conduct-nikah/articleshow/87654707.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

While Banupriya was residing at Virudhunagar, her husband Vignesh was residing in Madurai district. On August 20, at around 10.15pm Banupriya was found dead under suspicious circumstances.Based on the complaint given by Banupriya’s relative stating that she was strangulated to death using her uniform belt by Vignesh during a quarrel, the Soolakkarai police registered a case against him under Section 302 (murder) of the IPC.Banupriya’s father, R Chandrasekar, of Ramanathapuram district filed a petition before the HC Madurai bench seeking a CB-CID probe in this case. The counsel for the petitioner submitted that the investigation is not proceeding on the right lines and the police are yet to arrest Vignesh.Meanwhile, Vignesh had also filed a petition before the HC Madurai bench seeking to quash the criminal case registered against him. Vignesh’s counsel submitted that the case of suicide was converted to murder without any basis. He submitted that the postmortem report also indicates it as a suicide.The additional public prosecutor submitted that initial features on the deceased body indicates it was a suicide, however, they are awaiting the forensic reports.Taking cognizance of the submissions, justice G R Swaminathan observed that the deceased person in this case is a police woman and therefore the officials would take earnest steps to bring out the truth in this case. Since the father of the deceased has certain misgivings about the investigation, the judge directed the DSP concerned to monitor the investigation and disposed of the petition filed by Chandrasekar.The judge further observed that the prayer sought for by Vignesh to quash the criminal case cannot be accepted at this point of time. Though the additional public prosecutor has given a tentative opinion that it is a case of suicide, they are awaiting the final forensic opinion. Observing that it is too early to come to a conclusion for terminating the investigation, the judge dismissed the petition filed by Vignesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/monitor-probe-in-woman-cop-death-case-hc-to-dsp/articleshow/87654709.cms||---

---||Vijayawada||AP: Covid cases account for 20% ‘108’ services||VIJAYAWADA: Owing to Covid-19, revamped ‘108’ ambulance services saw a 41% increase in medical emergency services between July 2020 and September 2021 compared to the corresponding period in previous year. According to the data from Aurobindo Emergency Medical Services (EMS) which operates ‘108’ and ‘104’ ambulances in the state, out of 12.9 lakh emergencies catered to during the period, a majority of them, accounting for 20%, happened to be Covid-related. Speaking to TOI, Suresh Kamle, operations head of ‘108’ EMS, prior to the pandemic, major emergencies included road accidents and pregnancies. With the inclusion of 432 ‘108’ ambulances, Kamle explains that there is a spike in number of emergencies that are attended to. After Covid, 18% of the emergencies relate to pregnancies. Due to lockdown during the second wave, the number of road accidents has dropped, accounting for only 10% of the total emergencies. Other major emergencies include breathing difficulties, kidney problems, loss of consciousness, poisoning and chest pain. Interestingly, snake bites rank 13th with 17,664 instances in AP. Officials said that during the peak of Covid-19, ‘108’ services faced oxygen shortage and had to rely on outside agencies apart from the regular vendors to cater to the high demand. Previously, average daily medical emergencies stood around 1,400 per day, now the number has touched 3,350. “In the revamped ‘108’ services, we have ensured that every mandal has at least one ambulance. Compared to past, we now have an ambulance for every 74,609 population. Previously, it used to be one ambulance for every 1.19 lakh people,” Kamle told TOI. Another advantage the new fleet has offered is the improved response time of the ambulances. “The time taken to attend to an emergency is between 15 to 20 minutes in urban areas and maximum 25 minutes in rural areas,” Kamle added. By next January, Kamle said, the government would be adding another 432 mobile medical units (MMUs) to the existing 656 MMUs of the ‘104’ emergency fleet. Based on mandals in districts, most MMUs are currently serving in Anantapur, Chittoor and East Godavari districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/covid-cases-account-for-20-108-services/articleshow/87653892.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Of the three, two are doing their BTech, while another is studying for BBA. The youngsters were sourcing the contraband through an app and police pegged its street value at about Rs 3 lakh. The accused claimed that they were buying the drugs from Goa, Asif Nagar police said. Police said that they nabbed Ajay Sai and R Ankith from Mehdipatnam and seized 50 pills of MDMA. Based on their confession, police seized another 60 pills from Dharawath Sai Charan, who appeared to be the one running the operations. Ajay and Charan are studying engineering, while Ankith is the BBA student. According to police, Sai Charan has been into the drug business for nearly a year and was purchasing it via the app. The suppliers either sent the drugs to the accused through their own delivery men or on some occasions utilised the services of courier agents. “Sai Charan was peddling the drugs through his associates Ankith and Ajay,” joint commissioner of police (West Zone) AR Srinivas told reporters. Police, who were in the process of taking the three into custody for further interrogation, said that they would be probing who was running the app. As of now, all the customers who were in touch with the peddlers were being treated as victims, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/btech-bba-students-held-for-selling-mdma-pills/articleshow/87654713.cms||---

Parents alleged that the school failed to take necessary precautions and added that many students are down with Covid-like symptoms. “I was forced to send my son to school as the schools stopped concentrating on children attending classes in online mode. Within two days, my son started developing Covid-19 symptoms. Today, I am taking the Covid-19 test as one of his classmates tested positive for the virus,” said a parent, whose son is studying in class 9. The parent said that despite requesting the school not to start offline classes, the management was adamant and parents had no choice. “I went to school personally and tried to convince the management not to start offline classes. My son hardly went to school for two days and he is already sick,” the parent added. The school, which has multiple branches in the city, resumed online classes on November 1. Hardly 10 days later, it was forced to shut down physical classes as a student tested positive for Covid-19. Parents said that they cannot take the risk of sending their children for physical classes unless the managements guarantee that all Covid-19 protocols are followed religiously. They said that it would be better if the management traces all the students who have come in contact with the student who tested positive for Covid-19 and inform the parents so that they would take necessary precautions. “The management should think twice before starting offline classes again. We can’t risk our children’s lives in the current situation where many children are testing positive for Covid-19,” said another parent. Parents said that there is a possibility that Covid-19 cases are being reported in several schools in the city and elsewhere in the state, but managements are hiding them and silently shifting back to online mode.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/school-shuts-after-kid-tests-veparents-slam-offline-class-move/articleshow/87654715.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

This extensive study will help in improving the quality of crop in the coming days by making it more resilient to climate change. As part of this study, an international team of researchers from 41 organisations led by ICRISAT has charted out chickpea’s pangenome by sequencing the genomes of 3,366 chickpea lines from 60 countries. It has done genome sequencing of 3,171 cultivated accessions and 195 wild accessions of chickpea that are conserved in multiple genebanks. The team has identified 29,870 genes that include 1,582 previously unreported novel genes. As part of the study, a comparison of the genetic variation in cultivated chickpea with that of its wild progenitor helped the researchers identify genes responsible for lowering crop performance. The study also identified blocks of genes (haplotypes) in domesticated varieties developed by farmers that can enhance performance of the crop. “We examined 129 varieties released in the past. Though a few superior haplotypes were detected in some of these varieties, we found that most varieties lacked many beneficial haplotypes. We have arrived at 56 promising lines that can bring these haplotypes into breeding programmes to develop enhanced varieties,” Dr Manish Roorkiwal, a senior scientist in genomics and molecular breeding at ICRISAT said. Dr Trilochan Mohapatra, director general, Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), and an author on the study, pointed out that the research can help countries like India boost crop production while making crops climate-resilient. Grown in more than 50 countries, chickpea is the world’s third-most cultivated legume. Dr Jacqueline Hughes, Director General, ICRISAT, said, “By developing many genomic resources for chickpea over the last decade, ICRISAT has helped the crop shed its ‘orphan’ tag. With our partners in agricultural research for development, we will continue to research chickpea and translate findings into crop varieties that benefit farmers, consumers and nations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/icrisat-led-study-conducts-largest-genome-sequencing-exercise-for-chickpea/articleshow/87654717.cms||---

Earlier, the student’s candidature was rejected during admissions under the third cutoff list. Kumar Ashutosh, the teacher-in-charge of the course, said, “In the fourth list, I saw that the particular student had paid the fees. I remember her admission was rejected earlier, and she had raised a grievance. The student had wrongly calculated the cutoff and the same was notified to the college admission committee as well. I was shocked to see that her candidature was accepted in the fourth list.” The matter was raised with the admission committee and it was discussed in a meeting on November 9. Ashutosh even wrote to the chairman of the governing body of the college. “It was decided in the meeting that the majority will decide if it is a case of illegal admission. There were some problems with her OBC certificate too,” claimed Ashutosh. On Thursday, CVS principal Inder Jeet Dagar wrote an email to the committee members that read, “As you are all aware that TIC tourism pointed out that the particular student was a case of the third list but has been inadvertently admitted in the fourth cutoff list. Therefore, her admission may be cancelled after informing the candidate.” Surinder Singh, the admission convenor in a text reply to the admission committee, however, said, “There has been no illegal admission in the college.” The principal did not respond to queries from TOI in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-teacher-objects-to-admission-of-student-who-wrongly-calculated-cutoff/articleshow/87655358.cms||Shradha Chettri

The manager of the hotel, John Kuria Kosh, will also be arrested after he returns from Ahmedabad, said cops who had arrested 10 people from inside the room on Wednesday. Police said that receptionist Priti Patel had provided the key to the room to the gamblers at the behest of Kosh even as the Aadhaar card the latter had emailed her for hotel records did not match with any of the occupants of the room. Cops also said that Kosh was the key person as he instructed Patel to provide the room after being approached by the main gambler Narendrasinh Jadeja. To facilitate entry records, Kosh had provided an Aadhaar card of one Sohil Kothiya, a Surendranagar resident in his absence, to Patel. During investigation, cops also came to know that the hotel room had been used for gambling activities for the past one month. Gamblers had come there for four times by paying the room tariff of Rs 15,000. For one game they used to shell out Rs 500 each.

---||Kolhapur||Increase in ethanol procurement price to help mills pay FRP: Experts||Kolhapur: The increase in the ethanol procurement price is likely to put the sugar mills in a better position to pay the fair and remunerative price (FRP) to sugar cane farmers, said industry experts. Farmers’ leaders said the mills should not have any problem now to pay even the additional money of up to Rs 50 per tonne of sugar cane to the farmers as they will benefit from the increase in procurement prices. The Centre has increased the procurement price of ethanol produced from B heavy type molasses by Rs 1.47 per litre. The mills with distilleries will, therefore, prefer to produce ethanol and the sugar production will come down by over 35 lakh tonne in the country. Since this quantum of sugar will not arrive in the market, the sugar prices in the open market will increase by Rs 1.5 to 2 per kg, which will also benefit the mills. Vijay Autade, a sugar cane industry expert said, “Production of more than 10 lakh tonne of sugar will not take place in Maharashtra in the upcoming season. The mills in Maharashtra suffer due to their distance from the non-sugar producing states. The mills have to spend more on transportation in comparison to the mills states like Uttar Pradesh, which are closer to the non-sugar producing states. Under such circumstances, increase in the ethanol price will put the mills in a better position to pay the amount to the sugar cane farmers.” Farmers’ leaders like Raju Shetti, of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, had sought an increase in the ethanol procurement price along the lines of the price rise in the international market. Shetti told TOI, “In the past two years, ethanol prices have increased by 60%. Therefore, we had demanded that the Centre increase the procurement price by Rs 10 per litre, which has not been done. Instead, prices have been increased by Rs 1.47 per litre. On the other hand, sugar is fetching around Rs 37 per kg in the open market. Therefore, both things have put the mills in a position to pay more than the FRP. We expect that the mills can easily pay Rs 50 per tonne in addition to the FRP, which we will insist on in the coming days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/increase-in-ethanol-procurement-price-to-help-mills-pay-frp-experts/articleshow/87653217.cms||---

Dhosi was also booked in two other murder cases and a dacoity case, but was acquitted in all three matters. A senior police officer said they have recorded the statements of Dhosi’s wife and son at Mumbra police station. The duo refused to speak to the media. The Dhosis reside in Mumbra’s Sri Lanka area. Gujarat police are expected to arrive in Mumbra in a day or two for further investigations. “Based on a tipoff, Gujarat police had nabbed Dhosi, a vegetable vendor, and Salim Kara and Ali Kara, both natives of the coastal Salaya town near Jamnagar, and found methamphetamine and heroin allegedly sourced from Pakistan,” said a police officer. “In 2008, Dhosi was arrested for murdering Pundalik Patil over a monetary dispute and chopping his body into three pieces. He was found convicted and sent to Kolhapur jail. He met Salim and Ali in jail and they may have hatched the conspiracy of pushing drugs,” the police officer added. According to police records, in 2007, Naupada police had booked Dhosi for allegedly kidnapping a man, Umesh Tanna, robbing his gold ornaments and chopping off his head. In 2005, Central police in Ulhasnagar had booked Dhosi for allegedly killing a bar girl Heena and the dacoity case had been registered at the Bazarpeth police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/guj-drug-haul-mumbra-man-was-on-parole-in-murder-case/articleshow/87655790.cms||Nishikant Karlikar
---||Agra||8 dead peacocks found near wheat field in Agra, pesticide poisoning suspected||Agra: Eight peacocks were found dead near a wheat field in Agra’s Lalau village under Akola block on Thursday. Farmers informed the forest department officials. Preliminary investigations indicate that pesticides, sprayed by farmers in the field to protect their wheat grains from insects, could be the cause of peacock deaths. Officials said consumption of such pesticide-laden grain by animals continuously for a few days can be fatal for them. Diwakar Srivastava, divisional forest officer, National Chambal Sanctuary, Agra, told TOI that the carcasses of the peacocks have been sent for post-mortem at Akola block to ascertain their cause of death. The report is yet to be received. He said, their viscera have been sent to IVRI, Bareilly. Unidentified people have been booked under various sections of the Wildlife Protection Act for the peacock deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/8-dead-peacocks-found-near-wheat-field-in-agra-pesticide-poisoning-suspected/articleshow/87653947.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Vijayawada||6,884 RBKs to buy paddy during kharif||Amaravati: The state government has readied the plan for paddy procurement from farmers during Kharif season through Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBKs). Agriculture and civil supplies department officials will visit paddy fields to buy crop based on e-crop enrolment. Government estimated that a yield of around 80 lakh metric tonnes is expected to be produced from about 40 lakh acres during current season and set a target of procuring around 50 lakh metric tonnes from farmers. The government procured a record volume of 47 lakh metric tonnes of stock during the last Kharif season by spending close to Rs 9000 crore. Interestingly, the state government had pressed Markfed into service to extend support to the civil supplies department. The civil supplies department had identified about 6,884 RBKs for procurement of paddy in different districts. Civil supplies minister Kodali Sri Venkateswara Rao and commissioner Girija Sankar took stock of the situation and directed joint collectors in all districts to get ready to launch procurement operations. Joint collectors were directed to coordinate with field-level teams in RBKs to provide best possible services to farmers. “No farmer should be denied opportunity to sell their stock. Every grain should be procured by the department without allowing millers or middlemen to enter the scene,” said civil supplies commissioner Girija Sankar. The government brought further amendments to the procurement policy to help farmers easily sell their stocks. The government is also readying plans to clear the paddy procurement dues within 21 days of purchase. The government announced a Minimum Support Price of Rs 1,960 per quintal for A grade and Rs 1,940 for common variety of paddy. The paddy procured would be shifted to the local rice mills for milling purpose. The millers had to return the rice under Custom Milling Rice system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/6884-rbks-to-buy-paddy-during-kharif/articleshow/87653943.cms||Samdani MN
---||Goa||Goa: 100-million-year-old Jurassic forests thrive in Sanguem||KERI: In Talauli, Bhati, inside the Netravali Wildlife Sanctuary, there stand patches of relic forests with the unique Myristica swamp ecosystem, which are over 100 million years old. These swamp forests are endemic to the Western Ghats and a smaller distribution exists in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The Myristica swamp ecosystem plays a crucial role in maintaining a perennial stream flow and has immense potential to store carbon, thus helping the globe in reducing carbon emissions. “In Bhati, there are already two places, Barazan and Suryagal, which have the Myristica swamp vegetation. As these areas are inside sanctuaries they have been protected and prove to be perennial sources of water for wildlife,” range forest officer of Netravali sanctuary, Bipin Faldesai, said. These freshwater swamps fall under the umbrella category of ecologically sensitive areas and Myristica swamps are classified as unique evergreen regions. In 1999, the area of the Myristica swamp in Talauli was included in the Netravali Wildlife Sanctuary. However, the Goa government allowed mining activities in nearby areas to continue, which meant the threat of destruction hung over these ancient forest patches. When on November 7, 2003, the Centrally Empowered Committee constituted by the Supreme Court directed the Goa government to stop even removal of grass from the sanctuaries, this helped protect the swamp vegetation legally. “There is urgent need to map and carry out further research on Myristica swamp across the Western Ghats by documenting genetic diversity and local threats,” wildlifer from Kasarpal in Bicholim, Subodh Naik, said. These trees help in retaining water during the monsoon and then gradually release it during lean seasons. Varied species of flora and fauna inhabit these enigmatic ecosystems. The forest has evolved to live in the waterlogged conditions of swamps with knee roots and stilt roots. Knee roots emerge from the ground and are used for exchanging gases, while stilt roots sprout from the main trunk and help support the trees mechanically in the soft and unstable soil. “The forest dwelling communities earlier residing in Talauli in Bhati were aware about the ecological importance of these evergreen patches of forests and hence they protected the area as sacred groves. However, for the last century or so these communities have gone into oblivion,” Gokuldas Babuso Gaonkar, 60, from Potre in Sanguem, said, highlighting the need for special conservation efforts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/100-million-yr-old-jurassic-forests-thrive-in-sanguem/articleshow/87654765.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar
---||Kolkata||At some CU colleges, student’s jab certificate will be entry pass||Kolkata: Students’ vaccination certificates may be treated as entry passes at a few colleges in the city when campuses reopen on November 16. Those institutes have asked the students to submit their vaccination certificates before going in for their on-campus classes. Calcutta University-affiliated colleges, such as Loreto, Maulana Azad, Asutosh and Scottish Church, are some of the institutes which have taken this step for “safety purpose”. Heads of the departments have been given the responsibility of circulating the message among their students. Loreto College has formed a Covid Care Committee and Covid Sanitization and Fumigation Committee to ensure safety measures are maintained. Third and fifth-semester undergraduate students and those in MA and BEd will attend on-campus classes from November 16. “Soft copies of Covid vaccination certificates of students arriving on the campus will be received by the HoDs. The college is taking all precautions to ensure a safe environment and will review the modalities 10 days later,” said principal Christine Coutinho. But New Alipore College will not ask students to show vaccination certificate immediately, but once they start attending classes, the authorities will collect their details and build a database. Principal Jaydeep Sarangi said, “Once we have details of their vaccination status, we can arrange for a vaccination camp for those who are yet to get their second dose or even the first.” Even Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira officials said they would help their students get their second doses. “Most of our students have received both the doses of vaccine, but some are yet to get their second ones. We will help students coming to the campus get their second doses, if required,” said Swami Mahaprajnanada, vice-principal at the college. When the higher education department had published a guideline on campus reopening, it had not mentioned anything about students’ vaccination. Some college authorities have decided not to call freshers to the campus immediately as many of them—close to 30% of them—might still be below 18 years and may not have received their vaccines yet. “If we call those unvaccinated youngsters to the campus, we will put them at risk. The government should have spelt out the norm on this issue,” said the principal of a south Kolkata college. Like at Loreto, heads of the departments at Scottish Church will collect the soft copies of vaccination certificates of UG third and fifth semesters who will go to college after November 16. At least one dose is a must for attending physical classes. “A vaccination camp was arranged. It is expected third and fifth-semester students would have at least one dose. Without it, no one will be allowed to attend on-campus classes,” said vice-principal Supratim Das. Asutosh College and Maulana Azad have taken a similar decision. “All classes have their WhatsApp groups. Over there, students have been told to show their vaccination certificates when they enter the college,” said an Asutosh College official. Maulana Azad principal Subhasis Dutta said, “Students have to submit vaccination certificates and consent letters from their parents before stepping into campuses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/at-some-cu-colleges-students-jab-certificate-will-be-entry-pass/articleshow/87654784.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Agra||AMU prof receives Rs 10 lakh ransom note with 3 empty cartridges||Agra: Aligarh police on Wednesday arrested three persons, including the nephew of a woman professor of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), for allegedly sending her a ransom letter, along with empty gun cartridges, demanding Rs 10 lakh from her. Police said five persons, including the prime accused, Danish Ali, who is a nephew of Dr Shagufta Moin, professor in department of biochemistry in AMU’s Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, had planned to extort money from her. While Danish and two of his friends — Anjeb Rehman and Deepak Tewari -- have been arrested, their accomplices Mohd Naved and Mohd Adnan are absconding. Deepak had managed to procure a SIM card using a fake ID proof to call the professor’s family, said police. During interrogation, Danish told police that he needed money to repay his debts. He claimed that he had earlier asked for Rs 1 lakh from Dr Moin for the treatment of his newborn child but she had refused and his baby had died. He said he wanted to take revenge on her, and thus planned to extort money by threatening her. An FIR was registered under section 387 (putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt, in order to commit extortion), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 120 B (criminal conspiracy) of IPC at Kawarsi police station on a basis of a complaint filed by Dr Moin’s husband, Naved Mukhtar, a businessman. Another FIR was lodged against the accused under section 3/25 of the Arms Act. In the FIR, Mukhtar, stated that his wife had received a call from a person who identified himself as Raju from Noida on Monday evening, asking her to pick up an envelope lying outside their house. “When I opened the envelope, which was placed on the hood of my car, I found three empty cartridges that had our names written on them, and a letter demanding a ransom of Rs 10 lakh,” the FIR reads. Circle officer (Civil Lines) Shwetabh Pandey told TOI that police have recovered a country-made pistol, along with a live cartridges from the accused. The SIM card that used to make the phone call was also recovered. He said the arrested accused have been remanded in judicial custody, and a manhunt has been launched to nab the other two accused. When contacted, Dr Moin refused to comment on the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/amu-prof-receives-rs-10-lakh-ransom-note-with-3-empty-cartridges/articleshow/87653958.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

District Judge Ramesh Kumar said since the directions passed by the magistrate court regarding the supply of a copy of the chargesheet has already been complied with, there was no requirement for any inquiry to be conducted by the Delhi Police commissioner. A magistrate court had on April 12 directed the investigating officer (IO) to supply a copy of the e-challan to the accused, but it was not supplied till September 25. The IO had sought an adjournment for compliance with the order, saying he was not aware of any such direction given by the court. The court had then allowed the request of adjournment but imposed a cost of Rs 5,000 to be deposited by Delhi Police in the Prime Minister Relief Fund and directed the commissioner of Delhi Police to conduct an inquiry to fix the responsibility and deduct the amount from the salary of the alleged erring official. Police had challenged the magistrate court order before the sessions court. The sessions court said in its order on November 2, “It is further pointed out that directions, regarding supply of e-challan, have already been complied with by the concerned police official. Since the directions passed by the trial court regarding supply of copy of challan have already been complied with, there is no requirement for any inquiry to be conducted by the police commissioner.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-sets-aside-rs-5k-cost-on-io-for-supplying-chargesheet-late/articleshow/87655364.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The forest department had set up a cage about eight days ago after the villagers complained about spotting the big cat in the area. Moreover, a leopard had also attacked a 58-year-old resident two days ago. The victim escaped with minor injuries. The officials of the forest department said a health check-up of the leopard was conducted and the health condition of the big cat is good. Meanwhile, there have been several incidents of leopard attacks in the last few months. So far, three have succumbed to leopard attacks in the district in the last one-and-a-half-month. A 5-year-old girl was killed in a leopard attack in Wadgaon village on September 30. On October 3, a 4-year-old girl was killed in a leopard attack in Duber village in Dindori taluka. An 11-year-old boy was attacked by a leopard on October 18 at Kaluste-Darewadi in Igatpuri taluka, leading to the death of the boy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/forest-dept-rescues-leopard-in-igatpuri/articleshow/87653235.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Probe if Aryan case witnesses have links with Guj seizures’||Mumbai: NCP minister Nawab Malik on Thursday asked the DG of Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to probe if key witnesses in the Aryan Khan case have links with the massive drug seizures in Gujarat, which appears to be the centre of contraband trading. On Wednesday, Gujarat police had seized drugs worth over Rs 300 crore from the coastal Devbhumi Dwarka district, while on September 21, 3,000kg of drugs worth Rs 21,000 crore had been recovered from Mundra port. Claiming that BJP activist Vilas Bhanushali, Sunil Patil and NCB witness Kiran Gosavi—all involved in the cruise drug bust case—frequently visited Gujarat and enjoyed five-star facilities, Malik said: “NCB and NIA must probe if the Bhanushalis, Patil and Gosavi have links with these drug seizures...I feel that drugs are distributed across the country from Gujarat.” Malik further said that “innocent film stars” were paraded before the NCB office for alleged possession of negligible quantity of drugs, but even after seizing drugs worth Rs 21,000 crore, there is no disclosure from the agency over its source. Endorsing Malik’s views, Congress national spokesperson Pawan Khera claimed that the NCB has blown the Aryan case out of proportion to divert attention from the major drug seizures from Gujarat. “It appears that there is lack of seriousness; the NCB is headless for more than 18 months,” he said. Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said that the seizure of drugs in Gujarat’s Dwarka was a very serious matter. “ ...Now (NCB zonal director Sameer) Wankhede should look there. NCB should look into whether the children of the rich in Gujarat and the people of the film world are into drugs.” He advised to stop the ongoing tussle between Malik and BJP leaders. “In Wednesday’s cabinet meeting, Malik was lauded and supported. CM Uddhav Thackeray also praised him and said ‘good going’. Therefore, Malik’s battle has gained a moral ground. In the end, truth will prevail and the truth is on our side,” he said. —Prafulla Marpakwar & Chaitanya Marpakwar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-probe-if-aryan-case-witnesses-have-links-with-guj-seizures/articleshow/87655805.cms||---

So, we requested them to drop the case. On October 8, 2020, he told us he was withdrawing the case in next few days but withdrew the case after eight months. We are not responsible for any delay here.” Shekhawat said the Centre was working hard to establish a new tribunal quickly and even sought advice of legal department. “How can KCR, who is in charge of a government, speak like that? This is undemocratic,” he said. He went on to say the SC had decided to dismiss the case and following it, the Centre began the process of establishing a new tribunal. “KCR made various claims against me recently. It is my job to clarify and I am providing clarity to people of both states and the country,” he said. Shekhawat said there has been no apex council meeting in seven years. “But, I made arrangements and an apex council meeting was held with CMs of both states. If there was any delay, it was due to their disagreements,” he said. The minister said unless purview of boards was decided, no action could be taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/shekhawat-wades-intorow-on-water-tribunals/articleshow/87654757.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Gurgaon||Air turned ‘severe’, but at DLF-2, noise levels moderated||Gurgaon: Though post-Diwali air quality in the city plummeted to its worst in six years this time, noise pollution saw a reduction this Diwali in the residential area that was sampled. According to data from two monitoring stations installed by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), DLF-2 (residential area) saw a 5.5% dip in decibel levels this Diwali, while at Sohna Road (commercial area), noise levels were almost on a par with the festival day last year. The two stations measured noise in decibels (A-weighted), the relative loudness of sounds in air as perceived by the human ear. This Diwali, the peak noise level was 65.3db(A) at the DLF-2 station. The average was 64.2dB(A), the lowest in four years. The average level was 71dB(A) on Diwali in 2018, 70dB(A) in 2019 and 68dB(A) last year. At the Sohna Road station, the peak was 81dB(A) this Diwali, while the average noise level was 70.1dB(A), a slight rise from last year’s 70dB(A). It was 71dB(A) on Diwali in 2018 and 69dB(A) in 2019. Noise pollution levels recorded over a six-hour period this Diwali were between 61dB(A) and 65.3 dB(A) in DLF-2 and between 68dB(A) and 81dB(A) at Sohna Road. “Though Diwali witnessed a spike in air pollution, there was less traffic volume on Sohna Road and crackers with low intensity were burst at DLF-2, resulting in a decline in noise levels,” said Ram Niwas, an HSPCB scientist. This year, like last year, HSPCB had installed noise meters at two locations. In comparison, the pollution control board had installed meters at four locations — DLF-2, Sohna Road, IMT Manesar and bus stand — in 2019 and 2018. The CPCB standard guidelines for noise pollution, which were notified in 2000, recommend not more than 55dB noise in residential areas, 65dB in commercial areas and 75dB in industrial areas during the daytime. At night, the corresponding upper limits are 45dB, 55dB and 70dB. Need for more noise monitoring stations With just two areas monitored for noise pollution on Diwali, the data isn’t indicative for the entire city, according to experts.  They suggested that several locations should be chosen for installing meters. “Ideally, more locations should be covered to study noise fluctuations before and on Diwali in the city,” said Sachin Panwar, an expert on air and noise pollution. “Simply putting a noise meter in an area at random won’t serve the purpose. The authorities should get in touch with RWAs across the city, and through them, educate residents about the impact of noise pollution. Moreover, Old Gurgaon and new areas in the city are not being represented in the current data. The monitoring stations are only at two locations, which isn’t giving a fair view of the situation,” Panwar added. A senior HSPCB official said they plan to set up a continuous, real-time noise measuring system with digital display boards and a centralised network at four locations. “We have a plan for installing permanent noise monitoring stations in Gurgaon soon. They will monitor noise levels continuously round the clock,” the official said, adding that HSPCB already has a network of air quality monitoring stations and is likely to install the noise monitoring stations in the same locations — Vikas Sadan, Teri Gram, Gwalpahari and Sector 51. Residents in areas like sectors 50, 57, 89, 90 and 92 that TOI spoke to said crackers hadn’t seemed muted in their neighbourhoods on Diwali evening. “Bursting of crackers started at 7pm on Diwali and continued till 11pm. We couldn’t sleep and my husband faced breathing difficulties due to pollution,” said Rekha Aggarwal, a resident of Sector 57. “There are no civic bodies to monitor newly-developed sectors. A few residents went on bursting crackers all night,” said Punit Kaushal, resident of Sector 89. In areas like DLF-2, MG Road and Sushant Lok, on the other hand, residents said instances of loud crackers going off were isolated ones. “I could hear faint sounds of crackers. Nothing very noisy,” said Tanvi Nayak, a resident of DLF-2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/air-turned-severe-but-at-dlf-2-noise-levels-moderated/articleshow/87649632.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Agra||UP custodial death: Hunt on for 'kidnapped' girl, magisterial probe on||AGRA: The Kasganj police have been unable to locate the 16-year-old Hindu girl that Mohammad Altaf, 22, who died in police custody on Tuesday, was accused of kidnapping. A special operation group (SOG) has now been asked to conduct a search. Earlier, the Kasganj police had claimed that Altaf strangled himself "using a drawstring in the hood of his jacket attached to a tap in the washroom." It was later revealed that Altaf was about 5.6 feet tall while the tap was less than three feet in height. This comes even as the FIR -- details of which tumbled out on Thursday -- filed against Altaf and an anonymous "friend" says that the girl left with the latter "taking her clothes and academic certificates to Delhi". The FIR was registered at the Sadar Kotwali police station under sections 363 and 366 (kidnapping and abduction) of the IPC. Altaf's family said events described in the FIR were "inaccurate". "Why would the girl remember to take her clothes and school certificates if she was being kidnapped, and why would any kidnapper allow that?" they questioned. His mother demanded a CBI probe over the alleged "murder" of her son in police custody. Superintendent of police, Kasganj, Botre Rohan Pramod said, “We are trying to find Altaf's friend who is involved in the kidnapping and abduction of the girl.” He added, “Primary investigation has revealed that Altaf and the girl had an affair but they eventually had a falling out. Altaf had confirmed during questioning that they had been in a relationship. We have the required evidence to prove this.” Police said that the two had met when the girl’s family carried out construction in their house five months ago and Altaf was hired as a labourer. A cousin of Altaf said, "Yes, Altaf knew the girl but he had nothing to do with her disappearance. It was not Altaf but his friend who had an affair with her. He used Altaf’s phone to call her. The police were informed about this after his arrest but they told us not to come to the station again. We were not even provided a copy of the FIR registered against him.” Family members said Altaf was picked up from home by the police on Monday at around 8 pm. They learned of his death in police custody through local reporters at roughly 6 pm on Tuesday. Altaf’s father Caahat Miyan said his son was not produced in front of a magistrate on Tuesday and they were not allowed to see the dead body before the post-mortem. Altaf’s mother Fatima said, “My husband was forced to sign a letter and record a statement confirming suicide in police custody. I have no trust in the local authorities. I want the death of my child to be investigated by the CBI.” District magistrate Harshita Mathur said, “A magisterial probe is being conducted. We have sent a proposal to the state government for monetary assistance to the family. We will also try to get a job for one of the family members.” Meanwhile, Opposition party leaders targeted the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government in UP over the state's law and order situation. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “Is there anything called human rights left in Uttar Pradesh?” Samajwadi Party leader and former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav also tweeted demanding a judicial inquiry. BSP president and former CM Mayawati called the incident "sad" and "shameful".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/hunt-on-for-kidnapped-girl-magisterial-probe-on/articleshow/87653980.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||India||Activists move Supreme Court challenging UAPA against lawyers by Tripura||NEW DELHI: A CPI(ML) member, a human rights activist and a web journalist moved the Supreme Court challenging the Tripura government's action of slapping the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act against lawyers who posted "Tripura is burning" and said the SC must give a restrictive meaning to "unlawful activities" under the UAPA to curb its rampant misuse. Tripura Police had earlier said that action had been taken against various social media handles for falsely claiming that mosques have been burned down in the state when this was not the case. A bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana initially asked petitioner's advocate, Prashant Bhushan, as to why they did not move the Tripura high court but agreed to fix a date for listing the petition for hearing. In general, the SC does not entertain petitions relating to state incidents and normally asks the petitioners to move the jurisdictional HC before approaching the apex court. First petitioner Mukesh Mukesh is an advocate registered with the Bar Council of Delhi and has been associated with the All-India Central Council of Trade Unions, the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) and the People's Union for Civil Liberties. The second petitioner is Ansarul Haq Ansari, who said he is a human rights activist from Rajasthan. And the third petitioner is Shyam Meera Singh, a journalist with web portal Newsclick who often highlights grievances of marginalised and minority communities. The petitioners said their grievance is against "the targeted political violence against the Muslim minorities in Tripura during the second half of October 2021, and the subsequent efforts by the state to monopolise the flow of information and facts emanating from the affected areas by invoking provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act against members of civil society including advocates and journalists who have made the effort to bring facts in relation to the targeted violence in the public domain". "If the state is allowed to criminalise the very act of fact-finding and reporting, and that too under the stringent provisions of the UAPA in which anticipatory bail is barred and the idea of bail is a remote possibility, then the only facts that will come in the public domain are those that are convenient to the state due to the ‘chilling effect’ on freedom of speech and expression of members of civil society. If the quest for truth and reporting thereof itself is criminalised then the victim in the process is the idea of justice," they said. The alleged communal violence had erupted in Tripura after Durga Puja pandals were targeted in Bangladesh. Two petitioners, Mukesh and Ansarul, had visited Tripura as members of a fact-finding team and had "put in the public domain a report titled 'Humanity Under Attack in Tripura', 'Muslim Lives Matter', published by Lawyers for Democracy, in a press release at the Press Club of India" leading to the invocation of UAPA against them by the Tripura government. Interestingly, the UAPA was enacted in 1967 to counter the threat of left-wing extremism to India and its sovereignty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/activists-move-supreme-court-challenging-uapa-against-lawyers-by-tripura/articleshow/87656367.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

According to police, Akash Ambasana (24), Ami Cholera (22) and Irfan Pattni (43) were found allegedly under influence of drugs from room 301 of a hotel on Racecourse road on October 22. The police also found three syringes — one empty, one partially used and the third was unused. The police had sent the syringes for forensic examination along with the blood samples of the trio. The forensic report confirmed that the syringes contained drug mephedrone and the same was found in the blood samples of the accused. Based on this report, Ambasana, Cholera and Pattani were booked under NDPS and Prohibition acts. Ambasana’s mother, Alka, on the night of October 21 had complained to police that her son had become a drug addict and was missing. The police found Akash with his ex-wife after searching throughout the night.

---||Aurangabad||One-dose vax must for ration, LPG refill in Aurangabad, activists fume||Aurangabad: The Aurangabad district administration, after announcing that at least part vaccination is mandatory to avail of a series of services, has now extended the norm to getting rations through fair price shops and refilling LPG cylinders. Besides, part vaccination has also been made mandatory for farmers seeking returns after supplying their yield to the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC). The latest move has evoked sharp reactions from a section of civic activists, who say the administration should first spread awareness among the public to improve vaccine coverage. The administration has already made it compulsory for people to have taken at least one dose of the Covid vaccine to get petrol and diesel at fuel stations and to secure different documents from the RTO, Aurangabad. Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan has warned of action against those offering services to the unvaccinated under section 188 of the IPC (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), the Disaster Management Act 2005 and the Epidemic Diseases Act 1897. “Anticipating a possible third Covid wave, Aurangabad needs to considerably improve the vaccination coverage among the masses. With only 55% vaccination so far, Aurangabad has figured among districts with very poor vaccination coverage,” Chavan said. Civic activist Ram Baheti said it was inappropriate of the administration to deny rations and LPG refills to citizens if they were not vaccinated. “The district administration should first take awareness measures to increase the vaccination coverage. Only after such measures could any coercive action be contemplated,” he said. Another activist, Laxman Dhobale, said that farmers in the district were already badly affected by the recent heavy rains and the pandemic stretching for more than one-and-a-half years. “The authorities should first convince the public about the importance of vaccination. Any compelling action against farmers or the poor and needy for want for vaccination is highly undesirable,” he said. However, state food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal backed the order of the Aurangabad district administration. “Despite repeated appeals from PM Narendra Modi and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, a section of people is not serious about taking the vaccine. The Aurangabad administration has taken the right decision to deny rations to people who are not vaccinated. Such tough measures will help in increasing vaccine coverage,” he said. According to Bhujbal, people should remember that the last two waves of the pandemic had created havoc in the state and many had lost their lives. “Vaccination is needed to avoid any kind of severe wave that we have witnessed in the past,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/one-dose-vax-must-for-ration-lpg-refill-in-aurangabad-activists-fume/articleshow/87653268.cms||---
---||Delhi||City court slams filing of two separate chargesheets in minor’s rape-kidnap||New Delhi: A court has come down heavily on police for filing two separate chargesheets — one given to the court and the accused, and the other to the complainant and the public prosecutor — in a case of alleged kidnapping and rape of a 14-year-old girl, saying it is a classic case of abuse of power/authority. Additional sessions judge (ASJ) Gaurav Rao directed the commissioner of police to initiate appropriate inquiry/legal action and register a case under the appropriate provisions of IPC against the investigating officer/station house officer/assistant commissioner of police (IO/SHO/ACP) concerned for committing a fraud upon the court. The judge noted that material facts had been omitted in the chargesheet filed in the court and supplied to the accused as compared to those available with the additional public prosecutor representing police and the complainant. The court said both these chargesheets had the signatures of the IO/SHO/ACP concerned and were dated June 1, 2021. There cannot be any bigger fraud committed upon the court and there cannot be more prejudicial act than the one committed in the present case, the judge observed. “Filing of two distinct sets of chargesheet... amounts to perjury/fraud and cheating. It amounts to interference with the justice dispensation process… It is treachery of the highest order,” ASJ Rao said in the order on Monday. “The conduct/act of the IO/SHO/ACP is perfidious and reprehensible. Fraud has been played upon the court and this is a classic case of abuse of power/authority by police,” he added. The court further said the police officials had prejudiced the right of the accused to a fair trial. It added that there were other lapses in the present matter that were also grave and serious in nature and appeared to be “deliberate and intentional”. “To point the least, the statement of the counsellor and the house owner where the victim was allegedly kept had given a clean chit to the accused and pointed towards involvement of one Umer. The investigation is absolutely silent on this aspect,” ASJ Rao said. The court summoned the DCP, ACP/SHO Jamia Nagar and the investigating officer (IO) concerned to remain present on the next date of hearing. During the proceedings, additional public prosecutor Ashok Kumar also said he had brought several lapses to the notice of the CP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-court-slams-filing-of-two-separate-chargesheets-in-minors-rape-kidnap/articleshow/87655385.cms||Usha Das

He replied to the query from vacation judge Justice Madhav Jamdar on whether he verified documents before uploading them on social media. The HC heard a defamation suit filed by Wankhede’s father Dhyandev. Malik said the documents produced by him can be divided into two parts: Certificates issued by authorities, like Wankhede’s birth certificate and nikahnama of his first marriage with Dr Shabana Quraishi; and the tweets. “I have reasonably verified the documents contained in the first part.” He added that Wankhede’s birth certifica-te record is with E ward and there’s a register entry, while the nikahnama was given to him by “a relative of the first wife”. He said Wankhede, in his complaint, hasn’t said that the birth ce-rtificate or nikahnama are false and fabricated. Malik urged HC to dismiss Wankhede’s interim relief plea for an injunction against him. —Rosy Sequeira||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/malik-reasonably-verified-docus-about-wankhede-in-mumbai/articleshow/87655814.cms||Rosy Sequeira

---||Agra||Jail riots: Inmate died as cop’s gun went off after prisoners tried to snatch it, claim police||Agra: Days after riots broke out in Fatehgarh district jail, police claimed that a bullet -- which apparently killed an undertrial prisoner, Shivam Thakur, 26 -- was fired accidentally from the automatic weapon of a cop while inmates were making an attempt to snatch it from the policemen in a bid to take over the facility. Following these revelations, police have booked over 100 inmates on a complaint filed by circle officer (city) Pradeep Singh, alleging that the prisoners had attempted to snatch their weapons. “We had reached the jail after receiving information of riots and arson inside the facility and when we confronted the prisoners, they resorted to stone-pelting and attacked the police personnel,” Singh said in his complaint. The circle officer also alleged that some inmates surrounded him and tried to snatch his automatic gun, and during the scuffle the weapon accidentally went off. Though he didn’t say that the bullet hit anyone, the FIR states that he saw that one prisoner was subsequently taken to hospital with injuries. A second FIR against unidentified prisoners was registered under 15 sections of IPC, including 307 (attempt to murder), 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from doing his duty), 353 (whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person being a public servant ), 186 (whoever voluntarily obstructs any public servant in the discharge of his public functions), 506 (criminal intimidation), 336 (whoever does any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life or the personal safety of others), 398 (attempt to commit robbery or dacoity when armed with deadly weapon), 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house) and section 7 CLA at Fatehgarh Kotwali police station on Tuesday. The earlier FIR was lodged against 28 jail inmates under 16 sections of the IPC, including 307 (attempt to murder), 120 B (criminal conspiracy) along with Prevention of Damage of Public Property Act, 1884, on a complaint filed by jailor Akhilesh Kumar. Just before his death, Thakur, had told media persons that he had been shot by the jailor while he was closing the barrack gate during the clash. He had been in Fatehgarh jail since 2017. Official sources told TOI that the manner in which Thakur was injured -- his abdomen was completely ruptured -- and it was suspected that a bullet fired from an AK-47 rifle had hit him from a close range. The riots in the jail on Sunday morning were triggered after inmates learnt about the death of a convicted prisoner, Sandeep Yadav, 28, on November 6. Though police claimed that Yadav died due to dengue, the Saifai hospital administration where he was admitted for treatment, confirmed that his test report for the disease was found “negative”. Yadav, who had been in the district jail since 2012, was sentenced to life in prison in a dowry death case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/jail-riots-inmate-died-as-cops-gun-went-off-after-prisoners-tried-to-snatch-it-claim-police/articleshow/87654036.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Campuses rush to repair damaged devices, wiring||Kolkata: With only three days to go for campuses to reopen, colleges and universities are in a rush to repair electronic equipment and wiring, which have either developed snags or run out of batteries due to long months of disuse. Once the government announced that schools and colleges would reopen for physical classes on November 16, the authorities carried out an audit. With the institutes being shut for almost 20 months, the equipment in laboratories, gadgets in computer rooms and other devices and facilities were found to have broken down as those had not been used much during the campus shutdown. Even as the institutes got down to sanitizing the campuses, drawing up new rosters for in-person classes and checking students’ vaccination status, they drew up a list and started repairs and replacements.  “The UPS batteries died. We got those replaced last week,” said an official at Scottish Church College. “The audit showed all the 16 computers in our computer room required repairs because of lack of maintenance. The college has been shut since March 2020 and nobody has used them ever since,” said the principal of a north Kolkata college. At Asutosh College, too, the authorities have initiated the process to repair and replace broken-down wires and devices. “Yes, we found out that some electronic equipment were in need of repairs. But we are hopeful of completing the process before students come in for physical classes from November 16,” said an official. In the first phase of campus reopening, most colleges and universities in the city have decided to bring in only students pursuing lab-based subjects or those requiring work on computers. Among them, most students will be from older batches, who have not got any practice in practical classes. So, it is important for the colleges that these facilities were ready before the reopening, said an official. “Students with science subjects have missed out on all practical work. So, it is important that we let them come before the others so that they can catch up with the curriculum. Our teachers have finished a large part of theory-based subjects and the portions left would be taught online, as has been happening now. We have cleaned the labs and sanitized them. Repairs and replacements of equipment and instruments in the lab have also been done,” said Swami Kamalasthananda, principal at Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Centenary College, Rahara.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/campuses-rush-to-repair-damaged-devices-wiring/articleshow/87654775.cms||Zeeshan Javed

He said that beneficiaries should get clear title after registration. The chief minister reviewed the progress of Jagananna Sampoorna Gruha Hakku scheme to grant title to beneficiaries of housing schemes through One-Time Settlement (OTS). The state government announced a scheme to clear all dues owned by housing scheme beneficiaries with payment of nominal charges under OTS. During the review meeting held at camp office here on Thursday, the chief minister asked the senior officials to closely monitor the implementation of the scheme from the top. He said that all the applications received under the scheme should be thoroughly scrutinized before routing them for registration. He said that there should not be any legal complications after the registration and the beneficiaries should get clear title. He said that senior officials should verify every application to find out whether field teams scrutinizing the documents as required. “The field level teams roped into conduct the survey and inspection of the documents should have proper knowledge of the subject to clear the application for registration. The field teams could gain proper knowledge over the issue only when the senior officials regularly monitor the implementation of the programme,” said the chief minister. He said that field teams should create awareness among beneficiaries that the OTS will provide clear title to them. “The OTS is not aimed at mopping up revenues to the exchequer. It has been designed to provide clear title to the poor people over the assets which they accrued by securing loans under different government housing schemes,” said the chief minister. Municipal administration and urban development minister, Botcha Satyanarayana, chief secretary Dr. Sameer Sharma, and other officials were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ensure-housing-beneficiaries-get-clear-title-deeds-says-cm/articleshow/87654016.cms||Samdani MN

In a statement, police said that based on instructions from the Madurai district superintendent of police (SP), V Baskaran, the rural cyber crime police looked into cases of stolen/missing mobile phones filed at all police stations in October. A total of 111 stolen mobile phones, most of them smart phones, worth more than Rs 15 lakh were recovered and returned to their owners by Baskaran. Baskaran called for more awareness in reporting instances of lost or stolen mobile phones to the police. “Often, there is a misconception that we cannot find the mobile phones. We similarly recovered 150 mobile phones before. Following it, more people came forward to report to the police,” he said. So far, in 2021, as many as 511 stolen mobile phones worth more than Rs 64 lakh have been recovered by the rural cyber crime police. The cyber crime police also recovered more than Rs 23 lakh cash from fraudsters who posed as bank officials and got personal details of bank accounts from victims. Around Rs 5 lakh was recovered in the last three months. The cash has been credited back to owners’ bank accounts The SP urged for more caution from the public against such frauds and to not disclose any personal information, including bank account number and OTPs.

---||Madurai||Traffic snarls in Madurai city as key routes shut due to surplus in Vaigai||MADURAI: Surplus water from Vaigai dam that was released on Tuesday night and increased to 3,000 cusecs on Wednesday morning entered Madurai city around 1pm on Thursday. By evening the flow in the river through the city increased to 4,000 cusecs. With the possibility of flooding in the low-lying areas of Madurai, the city police closed the Taraipalam at Simmakkal with barricades. Closure of the bridge to prevent anyone from crossing it resulted in closure of three routes connecting the north and south banks of the Vaigai river, which is integral for the flow of traffic in the city as the Kuruvikaran Salai Bridge and Obula Padithurai Bridge are under construction. This resulted in traffic jams in several areas, especially at Goripalayam junction on Thursday. Vehicles were getting piled up for the entire stretch between Goripalayam Junction and almost up to Yanaikkal bridge. “The nearest way to move back and forth from the south to the north bank now is Yanaikkal bridge and Albert Victor bridge,” said V Ramakrishnan, a resident of Kamarajar Salai. The volume of vehicles crossing Goripalayam is set to increase further due to closure of Taraipalam. “Since both Kuruvikaran Salai and Obula Padithurai are under construction, the Goripalayam Junction is inevitable as it is the easiest route from Anna Nagar. Now, the traffic has increased further and I had to wait for traffic to clear at Goripalayam junction for at least 15 minutes,” said K Darshini a regular commuter through Goripalayam. Police have erected barricades and warnings at many places to prevent people from entering the river. Meanwhile, the outflow from Vaigai dam that was 3,569 cusecs on Wednesday reduced to 3,465 cusecs on Thursday morning and to 3,069 cusecs on Thursday evening, as inflow to the dam reduced without rains in the catchment areas. The 3,069 cusecs include 2,000 cusecs that was let into the river, 1,000 for irrigation through the Mullaperiyar main canal ayacut and 69 cusecs for drinking water in Madurai and Theni. PWD officials said that water discharged from Periyar dam to Vaigai cam that was 1,875 cusecs over the last two days was reduced to 900 cusecs around 12 noon on Thursday. This is expected to influence inflow to Vaigai dam from Friday morning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/traffic-snarls-in-madurai-city-as-key-routes-shut-due-to-surplus-in-vaigai/articleshow/87654772.cms||---

Also, every district will have one Regional Transport Office (RTO) official, a police officer and an MSRTC representative monitoring the activities and helping private bus owners,” Parab said. The private bus operators in Pune on Thursday morning stopped all operations from MSRTC depots, citing security reasons. Private transporters also said while 2,000-odd buses had left various depots in Pune to many districts on Wednesday, 80% of them came back with little to no passengers. “In places such as Kolhapur, Solapur, Parbhani and Nanded, the MSRTC unions are strong. There have been cases in which windscreens of some buses were smashed. The MSRTC and the administration should ensure that such incidents do not occur,” said Baba Shinde, president of the Maharashtra State Goods and Passengers Transport Association. The issue of fares was also on the list. “We are being told to ply passengers for fares at par with MSRTC. But our buses are either luxury or semi-luxury ones and cannot match these fares. We had a meeting on many such issues with Pune RTO officials,” said Prasanna Patwardhan, president of the Bus and Car Operators Confederation of India and chairman-managing director of Prasanna Purple Mobility Solutions Limited. “We have been waiting at Swargate for a bus to Sawantwadi since 5am. The fare per person in private buses is Rs700 and we are eight people in all” said Shobha Giri, a commuter. Around 1:30pm, things began to improve as private buses made their way into MSRTC depots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/private-buses-can-charge-more-will-get-security/articleshow/87654778.cms||Joy Sengupta

Additional Sessions Judge Samar Vishal denied the relief, considering the seriousness of the offence and the fact that she may be a flight risk. “Even if she has kidnapped the child to recover her wages, it can, by no stretch of imagination, be a method for the same. Both sides have counterclaims about whether she demanded wages or more money, which shall be a matter of trial,” the court said in its order. “However, considering the seriousness of the offence, the fact that she may be a flight risk as having no permanent address in Delhi and also the fact that she left her parental house way back in the year 2018 as she did not want to live with her parents, she does not have a prima facie case of bail,” the court further said. As per police, the accused had allegedly fled to Rajasthan with the child after repeatedly demanding the parents pay her wages. Police further claimed that she had sent several messages threatening to kill the child if the parents did not pay the wages. The accused’s counsel had sought bail saying she was the poor and the only breadwinner of her family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-bail-to-help-accused-of-abducting-kid-over-wages/articleshow/87655387.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The Madurai district administration, police and fire and rescue services department officials have warned people against entering the Vaigai river for any purpose especially with the release of water from the Vaigai dam. In the first incident on November 6, V Rajasekar, 30, from Anaikarapatti was visiting his agricultural field and tried to cross the river.  Due to rains, the water flow in the river was around 7ft in depth. He was swept away in the water, following which fire and rescue services department officials carried out a search and recovered his body at Saptur Kanmai on November 7. In another incident, two people K Vishwanathan, 21, and S Vasanth, 20, who had gone to bathe in the Vaigai near Thuvariman bridge on November 6 were swept away in the current. Fire and rescue services personnel recovered their bodies on November 9. Vishwanathan’s body was recovered near Guru Theatre bridge in the city while Vasanth’s body was recovered near Kochadai. In another incident the same day, A Mustaffa, 20, from Virudhunagar who had gone to bathe near Saptur Keni Karai stream with his friends was swept away by flash flood.

---||Kolkata||At some Calcutta University colleges, student’s jab certificate will be entry pass||KOLKATA: Students’ vaccination certificates may be treated as entry passes at a few colleges in the city when campuses reopen on November 16. Those institutes have asked the students to submit their vaccination certificates before going in for their on-campus classes. Calcutta University-affiliated colleges, such as Loreto, Maulana Azad, Asutosh and Scottish Church, are some of the institutes which have taken this step for “safety purpose”. Heads of the departments have been given the responsibility of circulating the message among their students. Loreto College has formed a Covid Care Committee and Covid Sanitization and Fumigation Committee to ensure safety measures are maintained. Third and fifth-semester undergraduate students and those in MA and BEd will attend on-campus classes from November 16. “Soft copies of Covid vaccination certificates of students arriving on the campus will be received by the HoDs. The college is taking all precautions to ensure a safe environment and will review the modalities 10 days later,” said principal Christine Coutinho. But New Alipore College will not ask students to show vaccination certificate immediately, but once they start attending classes, the authorities will collect their details and build a database. Principal Jaydeep Sarangi said, “Once we have details of their vaccination status, we can arrange for a vaccination camp for those who are yet to get their second dose or even the first.” Even Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira officials said they would help their students get their second doses. “Most of our students have received both the doses of vaccine, but some are yet to get their second ones. We will help students coming to the campus get their second doses, if required,” said Swami Mahaprajnanada, vice-principal at the college. When the higher education department had published a guideline on campus reopening, it had not mentioned anything about students’ vaccination. Some college authorities have decided not to call freshers to the campus immediately as many of them—close to 30% of them—might still be below 18 years and may not have received their vaccines yet. “If we call those unvaccinated youngsters to the campus, we will put them at risk. The government should have spelt out the norm on this issue,” said the principal of a south Kolkata college. Like at Loreto, heads of the departments at Scottish Church will collect the soft copies of vaccination certificates of UG third and fifth semesters who will go to college after November 16. At least one dose is a must for attending physical classes. “A vaccination camp was arranged. It is expected third and fifth-semester students would have at least one dose. Without it, no one will be allowed to attend on-campus classes,” said vice-principal Supratim Das. Asutosh College and Maulana Azad have taken a similar decision. “All classes have their WhatsApp groups. Over there, students have been told to show their vaccination certificates when they enter the college,” said an Asutosh College official. Maulana Azad principal Subhasis Dutta said, “Students have to submit vaccination certificates and consent letters from their parents before stepping into campuses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/at-some-cu-colleges-students-jab-certificate-will-be-entry-pass/articleshow/87654783.cms||Zeeshan Javed

In the meeting, UT adviser Dharam Pal and other senior officers will put up UT’s longpending issues, like conversion of properties from leasehold to freehold and building misuse charges. Sources said the minister will also review UT’s functioning and Central government schemes. The Chandigarh administration had recently written to the MHA for in-principle nod for conversion of leasehold properties to freehold in the commercial and Industrial Area, phases I and II. Thereafter, Dharam Pal had also met MHA officers and raised this demand. The UT administration had last converted leasehold plots into freehold in 1983 in the commercial category. The matter was also taken up by MP Kirron Kher with the MHA and the ministry of urban development (MoUD). It was the long-pending demand of the industrialists too. Recently, the UT administration had even conducted a survey in the Industrial Area for checking leasehold plots. The administration had set up phases I and II of the Industrial Area during the 1970s on 147 acres. The plots are governed by zoning and architectural control, prepared as per the conditions prevailing at that time. There are 1,884 plots in both phases, of which 700 are of one kanal and above, and 443 and 180 plots measuring 10 and 15 marlas, respectively. There are 381 plots of five marlas. If the MHA allowed conversion of plots, it will have an impact on around 1,200 units. The administration had recently sought a report of violations in industrial plots, including leasehold and freehold. The report was prepared by the estate office and put up before a committee formed by the UT administration to address the demands of the industrialists. Thereafter, certain needbased changes in the architectural controls, in accordance with modern day industrial requirements, were allowed. The UT had even allowed that cycle stand can be used for storage of raw material and other purposes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/citys-long-pending-issues-to-come-up-before-mha-today/articleshow/87654781.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No Waqf office raided but am not scared of ED, says Malik||Mumbai: NCP’s Nawab Malik, the state minority affairs minister under whom the Waqf Board comes, said in response to reports of ED raids in Pune that the probe agency had not raided any Waqf Board offices anywhere in the state but offices of a trust involved in illegally procuring Waqf land in Pune. He also said that the ED was “most welcome to visit or raid” his home and that he was “not scared,” ED could “send him to jail.” Speaking to mediapersons, Mali said, “Reports saying ED raids Waqf Board offices and is all set to reach the residence of Malik are false and baseless. In the larger public interest, ED should issue a statement on the raids to halt kite-flying.” Malik said while he himself has taken a series of measures to clean up the Waqf Board, he would suggest to ED to initiate a probe into 30,000-odd trusts transferred to the Waqf Board by the state charity commissioner. “ED should join us in cleansing the Waqf Board and enhance steps taken by me,” Malik said. Malik said his information was that the ED had on Thursday raided the premises of the Pune-based Tabut Inam Endowment Trust in connection with a land deal. “The Waqf Board lodged a complaint with the Bund Garden police station. ED raided the trust’s office following the FIR lodged by the Waqf Board. So far, five persons have been arrested in the case. In addition, the Waqf Board has lodged criminal cases against seven trusts across the state,” he said. In the Tabut Inam Endowment Trust case, Malik said it was found that MIDC had acquired land worth Rs 9.64 crore on December 11, 2020. One Imtiaz Hussain and his colleagues secured compensation of Rs 7.76 crore for the land on the basis of a forged NOC. After the fraud was detected, the Waqf Board CEO cancelled the entire deal and a criminal case was filed with the police on August 13 this year. Along with the Tabut trust, offences have been registered against Jumma Masjid, Thane, Darga Masjid, Beed, Majeed Devi, Beed, Darga Burhan, Parbhani, Majjit Chhota, Jalna and Darga Nurul, Aurangabad, he said. Malik claimed ever since he took over reins of the minority affairs department, he has launched a clean-up operation. “Don’t be surprised if a top BJP leader is arrested for his alleged involvement in an illegal land deal,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-waqf-office-raided-but-am-not-scared-of-ed-says-malik/articleshow/87655827.cms||---

Taking a serious note of the circular issued by Palamaneru deputy superintendent of police (DSP), the high court observed that the notices issued by the DSP are reflecting the prevailing situation in the state. Palameru DSP stated in his notice that a prior permission from the police is required to campaign in Kuppam and failing which action will initiated under the Police Act. Challenging the notices issued by the Palamaneru DSP, two contesting candidates from TDP moved the high court with a lunch motion petition seeking urgent hearing. Arguing on behalf of the petitioners, advocates Ginjipalli Subba Rao and Posani Venkateswarlu told the high court that issuing such notices is illegal. Campaigning in elections is the right of any individual guaranteed by the Constitution. The counsels for the petitioners further argued that the police are allowing the ruling party functionaries to campaign without any restrictions and obstructing the opposition workers from campaigning. They have said that four TDP functionaries including former ministers were detained by the police for participating in election campaign. Considering the arguments of the petitioner counsels, Justice D Ramesh stayed the notice issued by the DSP. He observed that when the election commission itself has not imposed any restrictions on campaigning, how the police issued such notices. Justice Ramesh further said that now the police are asking to take permission for campaigning and in future they might ask for their permission to file nominations also. The high court directed the Chittoor district SP to seek an explanation from the DSP and submit a report to the court. The high court further directed not to obstruct anyone from participating in election campaign and posted the matter for further hearing on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-stays-dsp-diktat-against-tdp-hustings/articleshow/87654032.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The incident took place in Nainital’s Tok Nartola village on November 2 but came to light later. The fish-seller, Bhagwan Singh Padiyar, died on Wednesday after battling for life for eight days in a Haldwani hospital. The four accused have been arrested. The revenue police, which looks after law and order in hill villages, has registered a case of murder against Chanchal Singh, Khushal Singh, Sunil Joshi and Bhupal Singh on a complaint by Bhagwan Singh's uncle, Ganesh Singh. The case would be transferred to regular police after the revenue police concludes its probe, district magistrate Dhiraj Garbiyal told TOI. Padiyar used to run a fish shop in Tok Nartola village. His relatives said he was closing his shop on November 2 at about 7 pm, when the four local men came to buy fish but refused to pay for the same. An argument ensued as Bhagwan Singh refused to relent. They then allegedly attacked him with a rod and a sharp-edged weapon, gouging his eyes out, blinding him. They thereafter dragged him to the roof of a house, threw him down and fled. He was later taken to a private hospital in Haldwani, where he swung between life and death, finally succumbing to his injuries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/fish-sellers-eyes-gouged-out-pushed-from-two-storey-building-for-not-giving-free-fish-dies-after-battling-for-life-for-8-days-4-arrested/articleshow/87654035.cms||---

The field was moist and shone with a tinge of green. Up against the novices was Chandigarh, whose new-ball bowlers were expected to exploit the seam-friendly conditions. They did, and were off to a flying start with a wicket in the bag as the fourth ball swung in dangerously. Then Anju Tomar took guard. She hit 16 boundaries, scored a swashbuckling, unbeaten 124 and ran to hug her girls. The captain of the Uttarakhand team had steered the ship home and steadied the innings like she often does. Outside the arena, though, the tribal girl who lives in a leaky house with a tin shed on the margins of Dehradun -- pots and pans hold off water from flooding the house when it rains -- says she feels like she's losing control of her "shaky life".

The Pune Municipal Corporation had asked for a total of 18.58 thousand million cubic feet (TMC) of water per year to meet the increasing needs of residents in its jurisdiction. Civic officials said the floating population has increased after the restrictions were eased, and that the needs of businesses and commercial establishments have increased as they have started functioning at full capacity. “We had raised the demand for more water in the past but did not get it. The administration will again urge the irrigation department for additional water, as the consumption has increased,” said Aniruddha Pawaskar, head of PMC’s water supply department. He said PMC will send a letter in this regard to irrigation department. “The merger process has been carried out; the population has increased and so has demand,” he said. “The consumption had gone down during the lockdown. Many citizens and students had gone to their native places due to closure of offices and educational institutes,” said a senior official of PMC. Now he said majority of this population has returned, adding to the demand. “Nearly 1 to 2 TMC more water is likely to be consumed in the civic areas, including in the merged villages. This demand should be considered, and more water should be given to PMC,” the official said. “PMC should make sure that it plans water supply. The distribution network should be strengthened so that water losses can be reduced. The water supplied to PMC from Khadakwasla dam should be used judiciously,” said a senior official from the state irrigation department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-to-seek-more-water-as-consumption-on-the-up/articleshow/87654796.cms||---

The electric buses initially will ply Sector 43-Sector17-PGI route. Recently, Purohit had asked the administration to ensure arrival of 40 electric buses by December-end. The directions were issued after the UT administrator’s advisory council’s sub-committee on transport issues submitted their action-taken report. A senior UT official said the remaining 28 electric buses are expected to reach Chandigarh by December. Recently, the Centre had sanctioned 40 additional electric buses for Chandigarh, which makes a total of 80 electric buses for the city. As per the earlier arrangement, the city was to receive a fleet of 19 electric buses on September 30 and remaining 20 by October-end, but the manufacturer expressed its inability to supply the buses by the scheduled date. The first electric bus had hit the UT roads on August 11. After completion of a month-long trial run, the transport department had asked the manufacturer to make some technical changes in the bus. Three companies had submitted bids to run 40 electric buses. The lowest bidder, Ashok Leyland, was awarded the contract to run the environment-friendly buses for 10 years on the basis of km scheme. As per the agreement, all maintenance expenditure, bus charging stations, suspension, HVAC system and major and minor repair of the buses during the contract period would be the responsibility of the successful bidder. The department will pay Rs 60 per km to the company. The fare collection will be done by the authority. After being charged, the bus will cover a distance of nearly 200-300 km and will take two to three hours to fully charge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/purohit-to-flag-off-first-batch-of-13-electric-buses-tomorrow/articleshow/87654801.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The bench of Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice AS Bopanna, while expressing serious concern about the alleged overcharging by hospitals, issued notices to all states and Union Territories as well. They, too, have been asked to respond within four weeks. The matter came up for hearing on November 8 and the order was made available on Thursday. Last month, as reported by TOI, the SC bench comprising Justices Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna had sought a reply from the Centre on this issue. Thapar had in October started a campaign to collect copies of hospital bills from families who had been charged excessively. “In 2020, the central government, in view of overcharging by private hospitals, had set a cap on charges for different medical facilities. For instance, a private facility could not charge a Covid-19 patient above Rs 10,000 per day for an oxygen bed. Similarly, the charges for ICU and ventilator beds were capped at Rs 15,000 and Rs 18,000 per day respectively,” he said. He added that “during the second wave, many people were admitted to private hospitals because of a lack of proper public health system and forced to pay exorbitant hospital bills...Many families exhausted almost all their financial resources to settle their bills. Our battle is to ensure that they get refunded.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/when-will-people-overcharged-by-hosps-for-covid-cure-get-refund-sc-asks-centre-issues-notices-to-states-uts/articleshow/87654059.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||State on high alert as heavy rains wreak havoc in south coastal dists||Guntur/Tirupati: The state government has put the district administrations in Prakasam, Nellore, Chittoor and Kadapa districts on high alert as heavy rains lashed parts of Rayalaseema and south coastal Andhra, affecting normal life and inundating low-lying areas. All streams and rivulets are overflowing even as the depression over the Bay of Bengal crossed the coast near Chennai on Thursday night. The Met department has forecast another low pressure area in the Bay of Bengal around November 17. Meanwhile, the northeast monsoon that brings in maximum rainfall in Rayalaseema and south coastal Andhra is still active. Power supply was hit at several places due to trees falling on power lines. Local authorities declared a holiday for educational institutions in the affected areas on Thursday. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, who took stock of the situation with district collectors of the affected districts through video conference, directed officials to be on high alert to tackle the situation. Asking the district administration to take the help of NDRF wherever their services are required, he asked them to set up relief camps to provide shelter and food to flood victims. He also announced an immediate relief of Rs 1,000 for each of them. “There should not be any laxity in providing relief. The collectors should take all required measures to handle the situation,” he said. He also asked officials to start a toll-free number to provide emergency assistance to affected people. “All departments should coordinate with each other to tackle the situation. Senior officials must monitor the situation 24x7 till the rain threat eases. Evacuate people from low-lying areas to safe zones and provide them proper shelter and food. Doctors and paramedical staff should be made available in PHCs, area and district hospitals. Joint collectors should monitor situation in hospitals,” he added. The CM also wanted generators to be kept ready in hospitals to handle emergencies in case of interruption to power supply. Chittoor district bore the brunt of the rain’s fury, triggering flood-like situation in Tirupati, Srikalahasti, Satyavedu, Varadaiahpalem, and Nagari-Puttur regions as most water bodies, lakes, streams and rivulets overflowed. As many as eight flights scheduled at Tirupati airport were cancelled. The temple city remained deserted as non-stop downpour since Wednesday morning brought life to a standstill. Waterlogging was reported in several low-lying areas of the city. All the reservoirs in Tirumala, including Papavinasanam, Gogarbham, Akasaganga and Kumaradhara-Pasupudhara dams reached full reservoir levels, forcing TTD officials to lift the crest gates of all the dams to release water downstream. Swarnamukhi, Bheema, Kushastali and other rivers in the district were in full spate due to heavy rains in the catchment areas. Vehicular traffic was also stalled at several places on the ghat road and in Tirumala due to landslides and uprooted trees falling on the roads. The hill town received 10cm rainfall in just a few hours. The AP southern power distribution company limited has set up control rooms across five districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/state-on-high-alert-as-heavy-rains-wreak-havoc-in-south-coastal-dists/articleshow/87654048.cms||Samdani MN

In her death too, Minakshi Rana gave a new lease of life to a few. The 41-year-old zari unit employee’s organs were harvested after she was declared brain-dead on Thursday. Rana succumbed to the head injuries she suffered in a road accident on November 9. Rana along with her husband Anil and son Krishna was going to a temple when their motorcycle met with an accident near Bardoli. Rana’s kidneys, liver and two eyes were harvested by doctors after she was declared brain-dead by the doctors at INS Hospital here. The kidneys and liver were transplanted to patients in Ahmedabad while Rana’s eyes were collected by a local eye bank. “The organs would have turned into ashes if not donated. Hence all our family members agreed on organ donation. A part of my wife will be alive in future too,” said Anil, also a zari unit employee. Donate Life, an NGO working for organ donation awareness, coordinated the donation and also convinced the family. “The family members were kind enough to agree and donate the organs of a young family member who died sudden death due to an unfortunate accident,” said Nilesh Mandlewala, president of Donate Life. The Rana family was travelling to Mahua to visit Vighneshwar Dada temple on the fateful day. “A woman was driving a moped just ahead of us. She was talking on her mobile phone while driving. Her moped slipped as there was paint spilled on the road in front of a shop on the Surat-Bardoli highway. As our bike was just behind her we too fell on the road,” Anil told TOI. Rana’s head banged on the road and she lost consciousness. She was initially admitted to a hospital in Bardoli and later shifted to Surat’s INS Hospital as her condition turned critical.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/zari-makers-organs-add-sparkle-to-many-lives/articleshow/87654194.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Charges framed against AAP legislator Prakash Jarwal in doctor suicide case||NEW DELHI: A court on Thursday framed charges of criminal conspiracy, abetment to suicide and criminal intimidation against AAP legislator Prakash Jarwal in connection with a case of alleged suicide of a doctor in south Delhi in April last year. Special judge Geetanjli Goel said prima facie it seemed the accused persons, Jarwal and Kapil Nagar, had created such circumstances that the deceased was left with no option but to die by suicide, more so as his source of livelihood was also affected. Dr Rajendra Singh (52) allegedly died by suicide in Durga Vihar on April 18, 2020. In his alleged suicide note, the doctor held MLA Jarwal responsible for his death. Like Jarwal, Singh was also involved in the business of water supply with Delhi Jal Board since 2007, and police alleged Jarwal and his associates were extorting money from other tanker owners, including the doctor. A case of alleged extortion and abetment to suicide was filed. The court said offences under IPC Section 120B (criminal conspiracy) read with sections 386 (extortion by putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt), 384 (punishment for extortion) and 506 (criminal intimidation), 306 (abetment to suicide), 34 (common intention) were prima facie made out against Jarwal and Nagar. It, however, only framed charges of criminal intimidation against Haris. “From the material on record, it can be said Prakash Jarwal and Kapil Nagar had hatched a conspiracy to extort the tanker owners and the deceased by threatening them to pay money if they wanted to ply their tankers with Delhi Jal Board and further demand was raised at the time of elections of Delhi Legislative Assembly in 2020... and the said accused persons also threatened to kill the deceased and his family members,” the court observed. The court further said sufficient material prima facie showed that Jarwal and Nagar had allegedly extorted the deceased and other tanker owners who, in their statements, had also stated about the extortion — Rs 15,000 for small tankers and Rs 20,000 for big tankers monthly. The accused reportedly demanded Rs 51,000 for small tankers and Rs 71,000 for big tankers at the time of the 2020 elections, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/charges-framed-against-jarwal-in-doc-suicide-case/articleshow/87655409.cms||Usha Das

Local residents said Pali also routinely hurled filthy abuses at the bovines, much to the discomfort of women in the neighbourhood. "He (Pali) uttered filthy language to the cows with sexual colour, especially when he saw women passing by," said a local resident. It's learnt some 32 families of Parvati Nagar have been fighting a grim battle to oust the cowshed, which has turned into a nuisance, from the locality. Despite approaching several agencies, including police, the residents could not find any solution for last several years. Recently, the residents, through an animal activist, handed over some CCTV footage of the cruelty by Pali towards the bovines to Ajni police, which booked the man. Residents claim Pali had been mercilessly thrashing the bovines. One of the CCTV cameras installed at a house in the vicinity of the cowshed had caught Pali raining blows on one of the bovines. In other footage, Pali can be seen pushing an injection into a calf, which became one of the grounds for the FIR lodged against him on the complaint of animal activist Anjali Vaidyar, committee member of Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA). Vaidyar said local residents were petrified to see heads and tails of calves hanging outside Pali's residence. "Some residents have observed that the cowshed owner would inject some materials into the calves, after which they would probably die," she said. "Even if it's a drug, only a veterenarian can administer such injections," she said. According to a local woman, Pali may also have butchered dead cows and calves for slaughterhouses. "He (Pali) keeps on torturing animals from 5am onwards till late evening," she said. Police said Pali claimed to have kept the severed heads and tails of the calves to create dummies, so that the cows can be milked as a traditional practice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cowshed-owner-booked-for-injecting-drugs-to-kill-calves-hurling-abuses-at-cattle/articleshow/87654080.cms||Soumitra Bose

While the government ruled out any possibility of reducing the taxes citing that the state has not increased the taxes for the last five years and reducing the taxes now would mean that it will not be left with any revenue, the opposition demanded that the government should reduce a portion of taxes and provide fuel subsidy to autorickshaw, taxis, transport buses and fishermen so that they get more relief in addition to the reduction of fuel prices by the Centre. Before the commencement of Thursday’s assembly session, the opposition MLAs led by opposition leader V D Satheesan took out a bicycle rally to the assembly from the MLA quarters. “Though the Centre reduced only a meagre portion of the taxes that it has been increasing, the state also should reduce the taxes so as to provide more relief to the public as it had earned approximately Rs 5,000 crore through sale of petrol and diesel in the last five years. The Centre and the state government are practising tax terrorism over the public and the state government is rejoicing when the Centre is increasing the taxes on petrol and diesel,” he said. He said that former finance minister T M Thomas Isaac had said that the government will reduce the tax if the Centre reduces it. But when the Centre reduced it, the present state finance minister is making excuses by saying that the Congress governments in Rajasthan and Punjab have not reduced anything. Now that those governments also have reduced, the state should immediately reduce the taxes, he said. Finance minister K N Balagopal, however, said that the government has not only increased the taxes on petrol and diesel in the last six years, it had reduced the taxes three years ago. As 41% of the excise duty being collected has to be shared with the states, the Centre is collecting the major portion of the taxes as special excise duty and cess, which need not be shared with the states. The state had also not imposed any Covid-19 cess on fuels like many other states did during the pandemic, he said. Moreover, the state has not compromised on any of the social security commitments and welfare activities being undertaken by it. If the taxes are slashed further, the state will be hardly left with any revenue, he said. The opposition members then shouted slogans in front of the speaker’s dais, demanding that the government reduce the fuel taxes. The UDF members later boycotted the assembly protesting the government not heeding to their demands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/opposition-takes-out-cycle-rally-protest-over-fuel-tax/articleshow/87654084.cms||---

Since the engineering department of the civic body has to complete the process, it is checking the documents of the company and making a report to send to the higher authorities for allotment.Two companies had participated in the bid to run the C&D waste plant mechanically, out of which an Ahmedabad-based one quoted the lowest amount for this first-of-its-kind project. “Since we require some more details, documents of the company are being checked for the final allotment,” sources said.“UT adviser Dharam Pal will lay the stone of the project on Wednesday. We have planned things minutely and since the adviser is keeping an eye on this project, senior officers will monitor its working and progress,” a senior officer said.The draft rules of the construction and demolition waste policy were with the UT administration earlier, but now these are with the MC for some amendments aiming to reuse 100% waste. The charges, transportation modes—private or government—everything will be finalised after receiving objections and suggestions from the public. The authorities are aiming not only at the C&D waste of Chandigarh, but also of Panchkula and Mohali.After processing the raw material, the machines will produce recycled aggregates such as stones, gravel, and mix of debris to make concrete and related material. The recycled concrete can be used to make tiles, kerb channels, and paver blocks, which the MC uses in different works. Silt, which is one of the by-products, can be used as filler at construction sites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/guj-firm-offers-lowest-bid-to-mechanically-run-cd-waste-plant/articleshow/87654810.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Mumbai||Ex-Maharashtra CM Devendra's wife & mantri’s daughter in notice spat||MUMBAI: After NCP minister Nawab Malik and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis traded charges, a legal battle appears to have begun between the members of their families. The ex-CM’s wife, Amruta, on Thursday issued a legal notice to Malik for alleging they had links with drug peddlers, while Malik’s daughter Nilofer on Thursday served a notice to Fadnavis for stating Malik’s son-in-law Sameer Khan was found with drugs in his possession. On November 1, Malik had tweeted some photographs of Devendra and Amruta Fadnavis with Jaideep Rana and claimed Rana was a known drug peddler and currently in jail custody under the NDPS Act. Fadnavis had then stated that Malik’s son-in-law Sameer Khan was found with drugs in his possession. Amruta Fadnavis asked Malik to remove the “defamatory tweets” within 48 hours and tender an unconditional apology to her, also within 48 hours. Nilofer, on the other hand, asked Fadnavis to tender an unconditional apology for making “baseless allegations” against her husband and pay Rs 5 crore on account of the “mental torture, agony, financial loss and injury inflicted (sic) to his reputation within 15 days.” Fadnavis’s wife pointed out that Malik’s tweets were defamatory in nature. “My client is an Indian banker, singer and social activist having huge reputation in the field, and her husband is a leader of opposition and former Chief Minister, a philanthropist, who is actively involved in politics for the sole purpose of uplifting the downtrodden. The defamatory tweets have resulted in tarnishing the image of Amruta Fadnavis and her family at large,” her notice said. “Malik’s tweets suggest that my client has connection with the drug peddlers. Malik’s entire press conference was uploaded on his Twitter handle. Malik made baseless allegations, and it was done for cheap political mileage and with the sole intention to divert attention from misrule and failure of the MVA government. The photographs were clicked during an event organized for conservation of rivers. It was four years ago. Rana was hired by organizers of the event,” she said. Nilofer stated, “The allegations are baseless and without any merits. The chargesheet filed by the NCB does not support a single allegation levelled by Fadnavis. The panchanama dated January 14 clearly says the house was searched and no contraband/suspicious substance was found in my house or under his possession.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ex-cms-wife-mantris-daughter-in-notice-spat/articleshow/87655837.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Housing Board plans PPP mode for hospital at IT Park||CHANDIGARH: The Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) is planning to go for public private partnership (PPP) model for the auction of 8.23-acre site for a hospital at Rajiv Gandhi Chandigarh Technology Park (RGCTP). The board had recently written to the UT deputy commissioner’s office and sought clarification on collector rates of different categories, like residential, commercial, for the hospital site. Sources said CHB officials believed that private parties would not come forward for the auction of leasehold site and that too at higher rates. Therefore, the officials planned to go for PPP mode and the board has already studied the model of different states and union territories (UTs). The hospital site was put to auction with the reserve price of Rs 344 crore in September 2017, but despite many extensions, there was no response from bidders, as it was a leasehold property. In October 2006, the CHB had decided to develop residential and commercial properties on 123 acres at 20 sites and transferred the land to Parsvnath Developers at IT Park. However, the project could not materialise and applicants started demanding their money back. The builder had then approached the court. In January 2015, the arbitrator appointed by the apex court directed the board to refund Rs 567 crore to the builder, following which the land was transferred back to the CHB. The board then decided to construct around 1,000 flats on two sites itself, while the remaining 18 sites were to be auctioned to a builder or developer. The board had proposed to come up with a hospital on 8.23 acres, a school on 4.5 acres and residential plots on 4.55 acres. Both the school and the hospital sites are on leasehold, while residential site is on freehold. Poor response:In the recent auction, the board had witnessed poor response to its 163 leasehold properties, including commercial and residential, and 28 residential freehold properties. Out of 191 properties, CHB was able to auction only 32, including nine residential freehold, four residential leasehold and 19 commercial leasehold. Last time the board had even reduced the reserve price: commercial units on leasehold by 20% and residential units on leasehold by 10%. Nursing homes in residential areas:The UT administration’s health panel had recently submitted a report on opening of nursing homes in the residential areas to administrator Banwari Lal Purohit. Backed by MP Kirron Kher, the UT, in September, had unveiled the draft order for opening of nursing homes in residential areas and invited suggestions and objections. Sources said the administration has received around 10 objections and suggestions. E-auction of nursing homes’ sites:The UT finance department had recently given its clearance to the estate office for e-auction of six sites of nursing homes. Earlier, the UT estate office had written to the UT finance department to grant permission for eauction of these sites and to clarify terms and conditions for it. Sources in the UT estate office said the reserve price of these sites will be finalised as per collector rates of the area. They are targeting to complete the process within a month, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chb-plans-ppp-mode-for-hospital-at-it-park/articleshow/87654814.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Launched in October 2018, the Tamil Nadu System for Multi-Hazard Potential Impact Assessment, Alert, Emergency Response planning and tracking (TN-SMART) app would also help the disaster management authority to plan appropriate response measures to prevent loss of lives and damage to properties in each area based on the weather forecast. The app would also help generate a database of people who are ready to help government officials with rescue work during disasters. An official said, “There is an option on the app to enrol as volunteers. We need public co-operation during the cyclone, flood and other disasters for rescue work. We cannot identify the right people for rescue work during the emergency. So, we are requesting people to download the app and register their names, address and other details.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/officials-ask-public-to-use-tn-smart-app/articleshow/87655408.cms||---

ADR, an NGO which works in the area of electoral and political reforms, said the total income of the regional parties from unknown sources stood at Rs 446 crore, which is 55 per cent of their total income in 2019-20.

---||Vijayawada||HC allows convenor quota admissions||VIJAYAWADA: The AP high court on Thursday allowed the state government to complete degree admissions pertaining to the seats under convenor quota. The high court reserved the orders pertaining to the seats to be filled under management quota. The high court modified the earlier interim orders passed in the issue. Rayalaseema Degree Colleges Association and Mala Mahanadu moved the high court with separate petitions challenging the GO 55 issued by the state government to fill up the seats through web options for both convenor and management quota seats. Arguing on behalf of the petitioners, senior counsels P Veera Reddy and Vedula Venkata Ramana told the high court that taking control over management quota seats is against the rights of the college managements. They have said that the students will be at the receiving end as the state government is not willing to extend welfare schemes to those students who get seats in management quota because of which they will end up paying three times more fee. As the admission process was stalled because of the pending litigation, they sought urgent directions from the high court. The government pleader for higher education P Raghuveer argued that the state government has taken a policy decision to bring all colleges under a single window system. He said the decision was taken in the best interest of the students and the petitions are not maintainable. Considering the arguments on both sides, the high court bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra and Justice M Satyanarayana Murthy observed that the state government through a legislation is trying to take over aided educational institutions. While directing the government to continue online admissions for 70% of convenor quota seats as usual, the HC reserved orders pertaining to admissions for management quota seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-allows-convenor-quota-admissions/articleshow/87654088.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Masked man steals 2.25kg silver from Sector 23 temple||CHANDIGARH: A masked burglar stole 2.25kg silver from Pracheen Shiva Temple in Sector 23 early on Thursday. The temple president, Dinesh Sharma, said, “The incident came to light when priests Jagdish and Phool Badan went to open the temple and found the lock of Shivalaya broken around 4.30am. The priests informed the temple committee members about it. When they checked, they found a silver sheet weighing around 2.25kg missing from the Shivalaya. However, donation boxes and jewellery in other rooms were intact.” Two sewadars were sleeping in the temple at the time, but they did not hear anything. Police have recorded the statements of priests and members of the temple committee and collected fingerprints of the suspect and other evidence from the spot. There are eight CCTV cameras on the premises. The footage showed a masked man in his 40s entered the temple by scaling a boundary wall around 2.40am and broke the latch of the Shivalaya with an iron rod. He then turned a CCTV camera to the other side and fled after stealing the silver sheet at 3.15am. Sharma said it was the second theft in the temple in the past seven years. Sector 17 police have registered a case. On November 10, thieves had stolen cash and gold jewellery worth Rs 15 lakh from the house of a retired inspector of customs department after breaking the locks of the main door of his house in Sector 51.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/masked-man-steals-2-25kg-silver-from-sector-23-temple/articleshow/87654816.cms||---
---||Kochi||CAG report lays bare state’s lack of preparedness during floods||Thiruvananthapuram: A report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) on the ‘preparedness and response to floods in Kerala’ tabled in the assembly on Thursday, has found that the state’s water policy of 2008 has not been updated in accordance with the national water policy and it lacked provision for flood control and flood management. It also found that the flood plains of the state are yet to be demarcated and flood plain zoning legislation remains to be enacted. The report said that no large-scale flood hazard map is available in the state and the state’s disaster management plan includes flood susceptibility map not in conformation with the Central Water Commission (CWC) criteria for flood-prone area. Only six rain gauges against the requirement of 32 gauges (as per existing BIS norms) were available for rainfall estimation in Periyar basin. Also, the project for obtaining real time data on rainfall, streamflow, etc. did not deliver reliable data on real time basis even after a lapse of five years. In respect of reservoirs under the control of the water resources department, though siltation studies had revealed significant levels of siltation in Aruvikkara reservoir (43%), Mangalam reservoir (21.98%), Peppara reservoir (21.70%), desiltation activities were yet to take off other than in Mangalam reservoir, which commenced in December 2020. The land use and land cover analysis for the entire Periyar basin, including the test-checked districts of Idukki and Ernakulam, revealed an increase in the built-up area by nearly 450% during 1985-2015 and decrease in water bodies by nearly 17%. Continuing presence of encroachments on Cheruthoni river bed obstructed the free flow of the river resulting in damages during the 2018 floods, the report added. Despite passage of 20 years since the commissioning of the international airport at Kochi and instances of severe flooding in the area, the irrigation, revenue and disaster management wings, the local bodies concerned and the Cial have not been able to ensure a well-maintained diversion canal adequate to carry the Chengalthodu waters (in the event of heavy flooding) into the Periyar river to sustain the overall hydrology of the area and ward off the potential risks of riverine flooding to the resident population. Lower than targeted dredging to deepen and widen the leading channel of Thottapally spillway coupled with the presence of over 500 trees planted inside the spillway mouth resulted in reduction of spillway capacity, contributing to the flood situation in Alappuzha in August 2018, the report said. Though 7,124 works of immediate repair and restoration of damages in 2018 flood were approved for execution under the state disaster response fund, 18% of the works were yet to be completed even after a lapse of two years and eight months (till April 2021), the report found.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cag-report-lays-bare-states-lack-of-preparedness-during-floods/articleshow/87654095.cms||---

The state government has given a nod to use its land for construction of this route, which will also give relief to commuters from Sangamwadi to Tingrenagar road. Better management of traffic in the Vishrantwadi areas will be possible after this thoroughfare is completed. “It was a long-pending demand that this road should be built soon. The unavailability of land had created obstacles in starting the ground works for the road. But now, an important section will come up for construction,” Siddharth Dhende, a corporator of the area, told TOI. According to Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) data, the road patch pending completion is around 20 metres in length. Of this, some 5m goes falls under the Survey of India offices, while 15m goes from the Balgram children’s recreation centre. The land was under the possession of the district administration. This district collector’s office had sent a proposal in the matter to the state government for final approval earlier. Now, around 2,610sqm of land will be handed over to PMC. According to the state government’s notification, the land will be given to PMC, but any damages caused to compounds of institutions along the road will be compensated by the civic body as well. The reconstruction of the compound walls will also be done by PMC. The PMC standing committee has made a provision of funds for construction of this road in its municipal budget, keeping aside Rs 2 crore to complete the project at the earliest. “It is an important route for the Nagar road areas. This move will give major relief to traffic, including two-, three- and four-wheeler riders,” said Sunil Tingre, an MLA from the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-allows-use-of-land-for-pending-yerawada-road-work/articleshow/87654823.cms||---

In its chargesheet filed before Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Arun Kumar Garg on November 7, the police, however, stated investigation had established that accused Anil Sharma, Sandeep and Deepak Kashyap allegedly instigated the unlawful assembly to kill complainant Mohammad Salman and entered his house forcibly. In the FIR, six complaints were clubbed together into a single case. During investigation into the allegations by Salman, his and his family members’ statements were recorded. The chargesheet said, according to these witnesses, on February 25, 2020, they were present at their house when a mob of about 100-150 people, allegedly including the six accused people, had gathered near his house. It further stated that the witnesses alleged that Kashyap, Sandeep and Sharma exhorted and instigated the mob. “As a result of this instigation, 8-10 people, including the accused, forcibly entered his house. He (Salman) also alleged Sharma and Sandeep had set his bike on fire...,” it said. The police further said that investigation has established that all the accused people are residents of the same area. “It is also submitted that on the basis of observation by Vinod Kumar ASJ (Additional Sessions Judge) in his order dated 14. 07. 2021, sections 395 and 307 IPC were added in this case. In addition, in view of the facts that as per allegations accused people were also carrying deadly weapons, Section 397 IPC was also added in the case. However, during investigation, no evidence has come on record, which may substantiate commission of offence under these sections of law,” the chargesheet claimed. With respect to the other complaints that were clubbed, the police claimed that none of them was present when their respective properties were alleged to be damaged. “Despite efforts, no witness could be traced/identified who might have witnessed that incident reported by these people,” the chargesheet further claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/charge-of-attempt-to-murder-against-6-riot-accused-dropped/articleshow/87655414.cms||Usha Das

---||Hyderabad||Flying to the US? Get ready to pay a bomb||HYDERABAD: One-way flight ticket costs to various destinations in the US have skyrocketed to Rs 1.50 lakh ever since the country opened its borders for all vaccinated travellers. The Covid-19 pandemic had prompted the US government to close its borders to international travellers from many countries, including India and finally opened up on November 8. Now with relatives planning to reconnect with their loved ones after more than a year’s separation, airlines ticket prices have gone up. According to travel industry data, a return ticket to the US until October was between Rs 87,000 and Rs 1.02 lakh. A return ticket to places such as Chicago, New York and Washington have all doubled and the costs have skyrocketed to Rs 3 lakh. Business class tickets, which were available for Rs 3.97 lakh until a few days back, are now being sold at Rs 6 lakh. Airline sources said people are scrambling for seats with all flights going full. “With limited seats available, these are being now offered at premium prices. Earlier cancelled seats are now being sold at higher prices,” said a senior airline official operating flights to the US. Agrees Siraj Ansari, owner of Avion Holidays that the prices are exorbitantly higher this time around. “Considering many people are browsing for the same destinations and flights, the prices on the online portals have been jacked up. The airlines have got a hint of the high demand following which they have surged the prices,” he said. “Despite this, those who want to travel are still willing to pay the huge sum and board the next flight to the US,” he added. The rise in ticket prices is no deterrent for travellers from the city as travel agents have been flooded with phone calls since Monday evening, with requests for tickets. As demand soars, travel agents said they are finding it increasingly difficult to service the requests. “Currently, the capacity on flights is limited and the demand is very high. Connecting flights via Dubai are catering to not just passengers to US but also other countries and continents such as Canada, Europe among others,” said Samad Qureshi, head, Fly Creative Online Pvt Ltd. With US government reopening its borders, the minister counsellor for consular affairs Don Heflin held a Facebook live with all the visa applicants on November 10. “If you are fully vaccinated, you can travel to US.

The complainant had married the woman in January this year, but she left him after staying at her marital home for three months, police said. “The woman and her so-called family took Rs8 lakh from the man for the marriage, and then fled with the amount and jewellery worth Rs1.60 lakh,” inspector (crime) Mangesh Jagtap of the Airport police told TOI, citing the complaint. Police said the complainant was working with the bank’s establishment in Pune at the time of his wedding and some months thereafter. He was staying at Vimannagar, which remains his permanent address. A few months ago, he was transferred to Mumbai, where he moved into bank quarters along with his parents. The police are searching for the mediator, the woman and the man who presented himself as her father. Jagtap said, “The Aadhaar card, PAN card and other identity documents of the woman and her family have been found to be bogus. The woman and her family claimed to be from Nashik, but their address was also fake. We summoned the mediator, who fixed the marriage, but he is not at his home in the city and has switched off his phone.” He added, “Initially, when the woman left the complainant, he thought his wife would return and even called her a few times. She responded to his phone calls and kept assuring him that she would return, but later on stopped taking calls and switched off her phone.” When the complainant started making his own enquiries, he realised he had been cheated. He also found the jewellery worth Rs1.60 lakh missing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cheated-by-wife-2-others-says-visually-impaired-man/articleshow/87654828.cms||Gitesh Shelke

---||Kochi||Off-budget borrowings can lead to debt trap: CAG||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) once again punctured government’s claims that it isn’t directly responsible for the borrowings of KIIFB. CAG’s latest report on state finances, placed in the assembly on Thursday, said KIIFB and Kerala Social Security Pension Ltd (KSSPL) are indulging in off-budget borrowing and if unchecked, it could eventually lead the state into a ‘debt trap’ even without the knowledge of the assembly. “Off-budget borrowing refers to use of these financial resources by the government for meeting expenditure requirements in a particular year or years, which are not reflected in the budget for that year or those years, for seeking grant/appropriation,” CAG said. These off-budget borrowings remain outside legislative control. They are financed through government owned or controlled public sector enterprises through market borrowings on behalf of the government. But, government must repay and service the debt from its budget, it said. CAG noted instances where the government resorted to off-budget borrowing through statutory body/government firm (KIIFB and KSSPL) amounting to R 1, 930.04 crore and Rs 6, 843.65 crore for financing its capital and revenue spending during 2019-20. These two entities borrow funds for financing various government schemes and projects, the expenditure of which are not disclosed in the budget or finance accounts of the state. In terms of revenue spending, off-budget borrowing was used for financing social security pension schemes, including welfare pensions through borrowings by KSSPL. In terms of capital spending, off-budget borrowing was used for financing critical and large infra projects through KIIFB’s borrowings, the report said. The report added that KIIFB incurred an expenditure of Rs 5,014.17 crore for government-approved infra projects till 2019-20, which are not disclosed in the budget or the accounts of state. KIIFB borrowed/raised Rs 5,036.61 crore from financial institutions till 2019-20 and paid interest amounting to Rs 353.21 crore till 2019-20 on them. The repayment of liabilities is done by utilizing petroleum cess and share of motor vehicle tax received each year from the government. Though repayment of borrowed amounts and their interest are being financed through government revenue, government’s financial documents do not reflect the borrowings, CAG said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cag-off-budget-borrowings-can-lead-to-debt-trap/articleshow/87654119.cms||---

To conclude the meeting on a positive note and sensitise the police officers towards the issues, plights and challenges of the members of the deprived classes and underprivileged communities seeking legal remedies and justice, the movie ‘Jai Bhim’ was shown on a projector. Each month, the performance of every police station and respective sub-division, crime branch, cyber police, economic offences wing and special branch is reviewed by the unit commander. Police officers confided that ahead of the review meetings, the fear of failing to perform to expected level keeps them stressed. Goyal told TOI, “The ultimate intention was to have the crime review meeting in an environment friendly and non-stressful atmosphere so that there is assimilation and dissemination of ideas.” Terming the meeting fruitful, the young IPS officer said that there was a healthy exchange of ideas and ways of executing those ideas. The meeting started at 9 am in the pandal that was put up in the open space of a lush green farm till lunch break at 1.30 pm. This was followed by Goyal issuing a ‘to do list’ for all the police station chiefs as well as senior police officers. Paithan’s sub divisional police officer Rahul Nehul-Patil said that it was the first time such a crime review meeting was held. “Not only for me, but for all the other officers, it was for the first time that we attended it in the lap of nature.” Goyal said he had positive feedback from his subordinates and most of them had found the meeting to be ‘less stressful’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-rural-police-meet-in-orchard/articleshow/87653394.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The association said that the Town Vending Committees of Delhi do not have any provision of grievance redressal mechanism yet. “Even after the Act of 2014, Delhi, through all levels of its governance, has failed to provide vendors the security of legality. Delhi has deliberately delayed the implementation of the Street Vending Act and deprived the vendors of their fundamental rights,” said Arbind Singh, national coordinator of the association of vendors. Recently, Delhi High Court had issued various directives on the pleas filed by traders in different markets of the national capital. “The TVCs need to be empowered more. Our key demand is to complete the survey of street vendors soon. The high court is asking for removal of illegal vendors from major markets, but the committees have not completed the survey only, so it has led to harassment of hawkers,” added Singh. The association plans to hold a protest across the nation next month on December 10, World Human Rights Day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vendors-association-to-hold-protest-on-nov-24/articleshow/87655419.cms||---

The two-hour in-person exam will test the students for all subjects depending on the class from standard III to X. For lower classes the exam will be conducted for 90 minutes and for higher classes the exam will be held for 120 minutes in MCQ format. Diwali vacation of all state government schools was cut short by a week for this survey. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has developed the Assessment Framework for gauging the competencies attained by the students vis-a-vis learning outcomes. The survey goes beyond the scorecard and includes the background variables to correlate student’s performance in different learning outcomes vis-a-vis contextual variables. It will be conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) as Assessment Administrator for Stds III, V, VIII and X students of state government schools, aided schools, private unaided recognized schools and central government schools. Director of the Maharashtra State Council of Education Research and Training, M D Singh, said that, “The survey will be conducted in a monitored environment in the sampled schools. NAS findings would help diagnose learning gaps of students and determine interventions required in education policies, teaching practices and learning. Through its diagnostic report cards, NAS findings help in capacity building for teachers and officials involved in the delivery of education.” In Maharashtra, schools and the students have been selected to appear for NAS by the Union ministry based on random sampling method. The field investigators have to report to school by 7.30am on Friday whereas the observers will report at 8.30am. Singh said that all schools have been instructed to follow the Covid appropriate protocol, including usage of hand sanitisers, mask, social distancing among other during the exam. Selected schools have to gather 30 students for the survey per standard. For instance, a school selected to survey classes 5 and 10 will have to call all students. Among them, 30 each of the two classes will be randomly selected with chits. The survey, in the form of a written test in languages, maths and science, is for 39 lakh students from 1.25 lakh schools in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/23k-students-from-state-to-appear-for-nas-test-today/articleshow/87654850.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

According to police officials, conditional permission was granted for Maha Padayatra after the AP high court’s direction that not more than 50 persons should be present in the rally. However, local TDP leaders and a horde of party workers attempted to rendezvous with the rally in bid to express their solidarity.  Cops said that they had to resort to lathicharge after repeated warnings failed and resulted in a scuffle when workers attempted to join the protest which could cause a law-and-order issue. In this regard, TDP leaders criticized police action with supremo N Chandrababu Naidu tweeting, “The right to protest is a cornerstone of constitutional democracy. I strongly condemn the brutal violence unleashed by @APPOLICE100 against peacefully marching farmers in Prakasam district today. The TDP stands firmly with the farmers. #AmaravatiFarmersMarch.” The Padayatrawill end on December 15 in Tirupati. The padayatra is conducted to seek support across Nyayasthanam (court) to Devasthanam (temple) to retain Amaravati as the only capital in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/police-lathicharge-farmers-as-tdp-workers-attempt-to-join-padayatra/articleshow/87654138.cms||---

---||Rajkot||Gujarat’s ‘mad tree’ can be a good one too||Rajkot: The much-maligned gando baval or prosopis juliflora (PJ) — the invasive ‘alien’ weed that ravaged large swathes of traditional grassland in Kutch decimating livelihood of Banni people — may have the last laugh if a scientific paper can save its existence. For years now, there has been a discussion to eradicate the weed to save the Banni grassland mostly under the demand of the locals. But, a paper recently published by GUIDE (Gujarat Institute of Desert Ecology), suggested making a separate management policy for PJ, as the weed has the capacity to generate lakhs of employment and can usher in major change in the entire ecosystem of Kutch’s Banni land. The paper suggests that PJ can be used in making bread, biscuit, syrup, coffee, cocktails and even brandy apart from its wood being used in making charcoal and generating electricity. It says that PJ’s multifarious usage is well known in various countries, though it has generated very little awareness about its full potential. The paper published in Global Journal of Science Frontier Research suggested better usage with a policy intervention to generate new industry and new employment. It, however, stated that this option is very expensive and practically not possible looking at the experience of other countries. Talking to TOI, one of the authors of this paper and director of GUIDE, V Vijay Kumar said, “We need to make a separate management policy for PJ. We have considered it an alien species but it has economic and environmental potential. We have to make a new management plan for PJ considering its positive and negative points.” Kumar further said that proper planning can help generate massive employment opportunities and usher in economic development to the arid land. Prosopis pods after removing the seeds are rich in protein and glucose. Pods could be useful for making cattle feed mixture, edible biscuits, energy tonic for old people and children, coffee, brandy, prosopis tree gum, but its products are not popular in India and for that spreading of awareness is necessary. In 2009, GUIDE published a research paper named “Prosposis: Ecological, economic significance and management challenges” in which they mentioned the potential capabilities of gando baval . According to the paper, this is an invasive alien species that spreads rapidly — the only negative point of the plant species — but that if this could be controlled, mankind can reap huge benefits from it. Its wood proved to be an important source of domestic fuel in rural households in the last century. The wood burns evenly and does not spark or smoke excessively and the calorific value of wood is quite high. The other use of gando baval wood is for charcoal and electricity generation. The biomass produced from it is used in electricity generation and can generate one MW electricity from 6,169 tonnes of fuel wood. The cost of power generation from PJ is also very cheap. How did it reach India? Gando baval first arrived in India in 1857 from Mexico. It reached Sindh, an arid region north of Banni (currently in south Pakistan) and then was also introduced to Andhra Pradesh by Jamaica in 1877. Later, PJ spread across many parts of the country from Mexico, Argentina and Uruguay and also introduced in Rajasthan’s Thar desert during 1930s to stabilize the sand dunes. This weed was introduced in Kutch in 1930s to fight desertification and by 2000, it covered 40 percent of India. With 43 million trees, PJ became the dominant tree species in Gujarat. Rich ‘alien’ food Pods of the tree are considered important human food item in Peru, Chile and Argentina. These have high calcium, thiamine and riboflavin content. Flour from PJ pods is used in preparation of sweet and syrup (thick, dark and similar to honey) and is widely used in north Peru to nourish children and the old and infirm. It’s also mixed with milk, fruit and corn flour for taste and flavour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/gujarats-mad-tree-can-be-a-good-one-too/articleshow/87654157.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

In a press statement issued on Thursday, the industry body has underlined the need for additional collateral-free credit to be extended under Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS). “Under the version of ECLGS 4.0, additional ECLGS assistance of up to 10% of the outstanding as of February 29, 2020, was provided to borrowers covered under ECLGS 1.0. However, the private sector banks are reluctant in disbursement of this additional amount due to which the MSME units are unable to take benefit of the scheme,” states the statement issued by GCCI. The industry body has also raised issues on insistence of banks on submission of original physical copy of expired bank guarantee. GCCI also sought RBI intervention in the matter to ensure that these rates are rationalized and a common minimum rate of stamp duty is made applicable uniformly pan-India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/credit-availability-gcci-raises-concerns/articleshow/87654161.cms||---
---||Pune||PCMC to set up animal dispensary, shelter home||Pune: The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation has decided to set up an animal dispensary and shelter home for cats, stray and pet dogs. The dispensary and shelter home would be run in association with non-government organisation (NGO) People for Animal. The facility would offer medical treatment to pet animals at nominal fees. According to the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) general body agenda, the case paper fee for a pet’s treatment would be Rs 20, while treatments such as anti-rabies vaccination would cost Rs 100. While X-ray of smaller-size animals would cost Rs 250, sonography would cost Rs 350. In case of hospitalisation, the per-day treatment charge would be Rs 300. Vasectomy of a dog would cost Rs 1,200, while that of a cat would be done for Rs 1,300. The agenda envisages that the NGO would appoint at least two veterinary surgeons at the shelter homes to take care of the animals, for which they have demanded an honorarium of Rs 50,000. Social activist Maruti Bhapkar said the twin towns have been through the stray dog menace and despite years of effort, the civic body couldn’t curb it. Residents, mostly who commute during the night, have met with accidents because of stray dogs coming in their ways or attacking them. He said, “Vasectomy of dogs and cats is the need of the hour. But if this is going on for the past 20 years, without any result then it is worrisome. We have to make sure there is transparency in running the dispensary . Only then the facility will prove helpful for the pets and strays.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-to-set-up-animal-dispensary-shelter-home/articleshow/87654865.cms||Piyush Bhusari

---||Mumbai||IIT-Bombay team wins Rs 1.85 crore prize for CO2 removal||MUMBAI: A four-member team of students from IIT-Bombay, mentored by their two professors, has found a novel method to capture carbon dioxide emission from industries, convert them into useful salts, thereby isolating the emitted CO2 gas permanently from the atmosphere. Their concept won them a prize of 250000 USD (or about Rs 1.85 crore) in a global competition, which saw participation from 195 teams. While two teams from the institute participated, the SASIITB was among the 23 student-led teams from 10 countries to win the carbon removal demonstration competition and the only single-institution awardee from India. IISc-Bengaluru which collaborated with other international institutes also won in the category. The winners were announced on Thursday at the Sustainable Innovation Forum at COP26 summit in Glasgow.Two Ph D students, Srinath Iyer and Anwesha Banerjee, an undergraduate student Srushti Bhamare, and a junior research fellow Shubham Kumar were part of the team to win the XPRIZE for Carbon Removal student competition, supported by the Elon Musk Foundation. Speaking to TOI, Bhamare said that being an energy science student, she was always passionate about the topic and when the competition was announced, they got together in a team to ideate on a concept and did their research based on available literature. Associate professor Vikram Vishal from earth sciences and interdisciplinary programme (IDP) in the climate studies department, also one of the mentors, said that the study basically focuses on developing a tri-modular system, wherein they would help capture the carbon dioxide (which is 15-20% of the flue gas) from large-point sources of emissions (such as power, biochemical, cement, fertiliser industries) and then convert them into stable mineral carbonates, which can be again used in the industry. “This way, permanent sequestration of carbon dioxide can happen from the atmosphere,” said the professor. The goal is to not attain net-zero emissions, but a net-negative emission, said Arnab Dutta, associate professor from chemistry department and IDP in climate studies, talking about the large amount of CO2 released in the atmosphere in the last 50-60 years. “Industries may be opposed to the idea of only capturing CO2 as it would increase their manufacturing cost, but what we are providing them is a new material that can be used in their industries, making it a cost-effective solution. For instance, we can convert CO2 into calcium carbonate that is an ingredient needed in the cement industry, or even other carbonates that will have some utility value," said Dutta. He added that the tri-modular system which will have the capturing unit, storage unit and the converting unit can work independent of each other. While the technology’s feasibility has been studied at lab level already, the economic feasibility is yet to be looked into. The prize money will be used to further the research and upscale it in the coming months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-iit-b-team-wins-rs-1-85cr-prize-for-co2-removal/articleshow/87655863.cms||Yogita Rao

In his welcome address, Jambusaria highlighted issues that accountants were facing, such as audit fees not being revised for nearly a decade. While Karad did not take any questions from the audience or the ICAI top brass, he assured them of looking into their issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/economy-recovering-on-right-track-mos-finance/articleshow/87654872.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||AP: Woman, son killed after inhaling rat poison spray||ELURU: A woman and son choked to death while her husband and another son were admitted to a hospital after inhaling rat poison powder in Prattikolla Lanka in Eluru rural mandal in West Godavari district in the early hours of Thursday. The deceased were identified as K Nagamani (53) and her younger son Nagarjuna (21). Both choked to death due to the impact of the rat poison sprayed around the house that caused breathing problems. The head of the family, Venkata Ratnam, and his elder son Harish are undergoing treatment at a hospital.  Venkata Ratnam, a pastor in Prattikolla Lanka, is staying in an iron sheet roofed house. His elder son Harish also became a pastor recently. His younger son Nagarjuna is a daily wage labourer. The family planned to kill rats in their house after the menace became unmanageable. They powdered rat poison pills and sprayed it around the house before going to sleep. Reportedly due to the impact of the poisonous pill powder, Nagarjuna died of asphyxiation and Nagamani was unconscious when the neighbours found them. She was shifted to Vijayawada hospital but died on the way to the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/woman-son-killed-after-inhaling-rat-poison-spray/articleshow/87654164.cms||Siva G
---||Mumbai||Nearly 50% of Dharavi’s 4.5 lakh eligible population has got both jabs||MUMBAI: Close to half of the population of Mumbai’s large slum belt of Dharavi has received both the Covid-19 vaccination doses so far. Officials said they have reached this figure by taking into account vaccinations done in civic centres, by companies via corporate social responsilibity (CSR) in the area as well as camps held by local elected representatives. Ward level officials said the total population of Dharavi is around 7 lakh but the number of those eligible for caccination stands at 4.5 lakh (those aged above 18 years). Of these, around 2.1 lakh are estimated to have taken both the doses. The first vaccination centre within any slum cluster was set up in Dharavi where the BMC aimed to vaccinate the senior population and those with comorbidities at an urban health centre, popularly known as “Chota Sion Hospital”. Until then, anyone from Dharavi who wished to get vaccinated would mostly head to the Bandra-Kurla Complex jumbo facility. Assistant municipal commissioner Kiran Dighavkar said 47.4% off the total population of Dharavi has been vaccinated. “Apart from civic health centres, vaccinations were held through CSR initiatives too. The BMC has helped mobilize beneficiaries with the help of local NGOs in cases where corporates came forward to vaccinate free of cost,” said Dighavkar, adding now their focus will be on mobile vaccination to cover all those left out in any area. “Since the ward began the vaccine-on-wheels initiative with mobile vaccination, the response has been very good as we could target those who have not taken the second shot. We will soon begin a house-to-house survey as well. That apart, ward war rooms have already started making calls to those who have not taken the vaccine, requesting them to do so,” said Dighavkar. Covid had entered Dharavi on April 1 last year and there were days when it had reported more than 90 cases as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nearly-50-of-dharavis-4-5-lakh-eligible-popn-has-got-both-jabs/articleshow/87655442.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Hyderabad||Covaxin well tolerated, phase 3 data shows 77.8% efficacy against symptomatic Covid: Lancet||HYDERABAD: A week after the World Health Organisation (WHO) granted Emergency Use Listing (EUL) to Covaxin, prestigious medical journal Lancet has stated that the phase 3 data of India’s first indigenously developed vaccine demonstrates 77.8% efficacy against symptomatic Covid-19. Its efficacy data also demonstrates 70.8% protection against all variants of SARS-CoV-2. Covaxin’s efficacy was arrived at through the evaluation of 130 confirmed cases, of which 24 were observed in the vaccine group and 106 cases were in the placebo group. The two-dose inactivated virus vaccine was developed from scratch in India by Bharat Biotech along with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Institute of Virology (NIV) Pune. The efficacy analysis showed Covaxin (BBV152) is 93.4% effective against severe symptomatic Covid-19, and offers 63.6% protection against asymptomatic Covid-19. It is also 65.2% effective against the Delta variant, 90.1% effective against Kappa variant, Lancet said. “BBV152 was well tolerated; the same proportion of participants reported adverse events in the vaccine group [1597 out of 12879 (12.4%)] and placebo group [1597 of 12874 (12.4%)] with no clinically significant differences in the distributions of solicited, unsolicited, or serious adverse events between the groups, and no cases of anaphylaxis or vaccine-related deaths,” the peer-reviewed journal observed. Covaxin safety analysis demonstrates that the adverse events reported were similar to placebo, with 12% of the subjects experiencing commonly known side effects and less than 0.5% of subjects experiencing serious adverse events, Bharat Biotech said, adding: “Covaxin was well tolerated and the Data Safety Monitoring Board has not reported any safety concerns related to the vaccine. The overall rate of adverse events observed in Covaxin was lower than that seen in Covid-19 vaccines. The safety profile of Covaxin is now well established”. In a separate comment in The Lancet, Chinese experts Jing-Xin Li and Feng-Cai Zhu of the Nanjing-based Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention pointed out that with the Delta variant outcompeting all SARS-CoV-2 variants as the most predominant variant of concern globally, with substantially higher transmissibility than other VOCs, the BBV152 Phase 3 results reported by Raches Ella and colleagues were a “welcome advance”. “…in a phase 3 trial of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BBV152) based on an Asp614Gly variant, the authors found a substantial reduction in symptomatic Covid-19... In the study by Ella and colleagues, in all the delta-positive cases, the viral load in vaccine recipients was significantly lower than in placebo recipients,” they said while pointing to the reduced vaccine effectiveness being reported in real world studies of other vaccines like the ones developed by Pfizer and AstraZeneca. Though Li & Zhu observed that the BBV152 study cohort was less ethnically diverse as only Indian participants were involved, they said “the study provides evidence of protection against asymptomatic infection that might be of public health significance, which has not been reported in previous trials of other SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.” “Generally, the apparent protection against severe Covid-19 is most crucial, but the capability of preventing asymptomatic infection would also protect against mild disease, transmission, and eventually might lead to a reduction in subsequent cases of severe Covid-19,” the Chinese experts said. Zhu and Li also said that the roll-out of the vaccine might ease the ultra-cold chain requirements of other SARS-CoV-2 vaccine platforms, increase the finite global manufacturing capacity, and improve insufficient supply of vaccines which disproportionately affects low-income and middle-income countries. Meanwhile, Bharat Biotech said Lancet peer-review confirms the efficacy analysis that demonstrates Covaxin to be effective against Covid-19 and that Covaxin is the only Covid-19 vaccine to have demonstrated efficacy data from phase III clinical trials against the Delta variant at 65.2%. “The peer-review of Covaxin phase III clinical trial data in The Lancet, an authoritative voice in global medicine, validates our commitment to data transparency and meeting the stringent peer-review standards of world leading medical journals,” said Bharat Biotech chairman & managing director Dr Krishna Ella. He said with this, data from Covaxin’s product development and clinical trials have been published in 10 peer-reviewed journals, making Covaxin one of the most highly published Covid-19 vaccines in the world. Terming the partnership between Bharat Biotech, ICMR and NIV as one of the most successful public private partnerships, ICMR director general Dr Balram Bhargava said the publication of the efficacy data in Lancet speaks highly about the strong position of Covaxin among the global front-runner Covid-19 vaccines. “The bench to bedside journey of Covaxin in less than 10 months showcases the immense strength of `Atmanirbhar Bharat’ along with the Indian academia and industry in fighting against the odds and carving a niche in the global community,” Bhargava said. The Phase III efficacy and safety study involved around 25,800 volunteers across 25 sites in India. So far, over 150 million doses of Covaxin have been manufactured and supplied and it is now being evaluated in controlled clinical trials in children aged 2-18 years. The company has submitted data of the children's trials to the Indian drug regulator and its partner Ocugen has applied to US Food & Drug Administration (USFDA) for emergency use authorisation for paediatric use of Covaxin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covaxin-phase-3-data-shows-77-8-efficacy-against-symptomatic-covid-lancet/articleshow/87654875.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Delhi||Delhi HC seeks DDA reply on hawkers’ plea on 2021 master plan||NEW: Delhi High Court on Thursday sought a response from Delhi Development Authority on a plea by the National Hawkers’ Federation challenging the Master Plan of 2021. A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh issued notice to DDA on the petition, which claims that the Delhi Master Plan of 2021 failed to take into account the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014. The petitioner, which claims to be an association of street vendors and 1,188 unions in the country, has said that the overarching objective of the Street Vendors Act, 2014 is to provide for and promote a supportive environment for the urban street vendors to carry out their vocation while ensuring that vending activities do not lead to overcrowding and unsanitary conditions in public spaces and streets. However, the Master Plan 2021, which was approved in 2007, “wrongfully retains” provisions that do not reflect the criteria set out for street vendors under the Street Vendors Act, the petitioner said. It also stated that if DDA was not directed to take appropriate steps to implement the Street Vendors Act, urban street vendors would continue to suffer irreparable loss that would result in an absolute miscarriage of justice. The plea argues that the sections for “informal sector” under the Master Plan are “manifestly arbitrary” and make no mention of the Street Vendors Act, which provides for a plan for street vending and the formation of town vending committees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-seeks-dda-reply-on-hawkers-plea-on-2021-master-plan/articleshow/87655444.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Digitization key to India’s future: Amitabh Kant||AHMEDABAD: Laying out a ‘green’ roadmap for the country to follow over the next decade, Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant while reiterating the role of digitization and real-time data, said the country needs to grow at high GDP rates for a sustainable period of time. “India really needs to grow at a high rate of 9-10% over a three-decade period, year after year, to be able to able to lift a very young population above the poverty line,” he said. The Niti Aayog CEO said this at the Indian Institute of Management – Ahmedabad (IIM-A) campus on Thursday while delivering the inaugural lecture for the series on ‘Public Policy Priorities for the Social Sector – Leaving No One Behind in New India.’ The lecture is part of the Public Talk Series titled ‘India 2031: The Decade of Transformation’ organised by JSW School of Public Policy (JSW-SPP) at the IIM-A.  Talking about the path that India must take to achieve public policy priorities that can result in holistic and inclusive growth, Kant talked about the role that digitization can play in building India as a future superpower. He added that massive benefit that can be achieved from tracking real time data and publishing it in the public domain to create transparency. Citing the example of the government’s ‘aspirational district programme’ where 115 of the country’s most backward districts were chosen for monitoring, Kant said that ranking them improved their performance to a great extent. “These districts were poor and backwards not because of lack or resources or lack of funds, but because of governance failure. The government started ranking them not on a monthly basis but on real time, minute to minute basis. We started putting the data out in the public domain. We started naming and shaming collectors (of districts that fared poorly) and started rewarding the better performing collectors,” said Kant. As a result, many of these districts are today faring better than the best performing districts of the country on many parameters, he further said. “I am great believer in good data, real time data,” said Kant. India is passing through a window of demographic transition that rarely happens through history and therefore this growth is critical. India has grown at this growth rate for short period of 5-6 years, but we need to sustain this over a few-decade period. Kant said that five key areas such as improving outcomes in education, health, and nutrition; promoting sunrise sectors of growth such as AI and data science, scientific urbanization, technological advancement and shifting to sustainable sources of energy such as green hydrogen can contribute significantly to India’s growth in the years to come. The country is poised to become a global leader for electrolyzer manufacturing and green hydrogen products. The government aims to bring down the cost of green hydrogen from USD 4 per kg presently to USD 1 per kg by 2030, Kant said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/digitization-key-to-indias-future-kant/articleshow/87654174.cms||---

In his complaint with Karanj police Rathod alleged breach of trust and cheating against an unidentified person. He stated that on November 6 he had scolded his son Satish, 18, who then consumed some poisonous substance. Satish was taken to the local hospital from where he was referred to Jivraj Mehta Hospital in Vejalpur. The complainant said that on Wednesday, when he along with his relatives were sitting in the compound of the hospital, an unidentified person came near them while talking on the phone. The person was telling someone on the phone that he had good contacts with leaders and can manage to get relief in the medical bill. Later the person asked Rathod who was admitted in the hospital, and the complainant narrated his story stating that his son had recovered, but the hospital asked for a bill of Rs 36,800 before giving him discharge. The accused then informed him that for the Devipujak community, Gujarat government gives Rs 1.5 lakh as subsidy and from that amount he could pay the hospital bill and keep the remaining amount with him. However, the person told him that he would be required to pay Rs 18,000 as GST cost for getting the subsidy. The complainant stated that he agreed. The man took his brother-in-law Jilabhai Rathod to Apna Bazaar in Lal Darwaja. He told Jila to stand outside the office while he got the documents signed from the officer. After this, he went inside with the money and never returned. Rathod then lodged a complaint with police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-cheated-with-lure-of-medical-bill-subsidy/articleshow/87654173.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Eyebrows raised over Kheda SP post||Ahmedabad: Government appointments are usually by the book and even when explicit rules are not framed, certain unwritten rules are followed. Needless to say, there is widespread speculation in police power corridors over the appointment of a junior deputy superintendent of police (DySP) as in-charge superintendent of police (SP) of Kheda district, giving her precedence over senior officers who are traditionally given charge when the regular SP is on leave. Arpita Patel, a 2011-batch direct DySP, currently posted as DySP of Kapadvanj division in Kheda district, has been holding charge as SP of the district since July 22, through an order of the IGP (administration). The appointment came after Divya Mishra, the then Kheda SP, went to deputation as additional deputy director in the central intelligence bureau (IB). After her appointment, charge was given to another officer, but the order was revoked within hours sparking speculation that it was done to protect senior politicians who may face action over large-scale illegal land deals in certain villages. “When the SP goes on leave for personal or official reasons, charge of the district is given to the seniormost of deputies for a limited period – 15 to 30 days,” said a senior police official on condition of anonymity. “But there are no written rules when it comes to the duration of holding charge or who to give charge to. It is understood that officers senior to the officer holding charge will not feel comfortable.” In the appointment of Patel, experts point out two anomalies. “Kheda and Anand are like twin districts. In the past, the SPs of either district often held charge of if the regular SP was unavailable. Instead, Patel has been holding charge for over three months now. This is unusual, if not rare. Secondly, Kalpesh Chawda, though Patel’s batchmate, is ahead on the seniority list. This decision could affect the functioning of the unit,” said the official, adding that two other DySPs in Kheda district are promotees from PI rank and are junior to Patel and Chawda. When the state government was apprised of the situation, on October 29, the undersecretary of the home department issued a notification, giving charge as Kheda SP to Vishal Vaghela, an IPS officer posted in the state CID (crime). Surprisingly, the order was revoked within hours, reinstating Patel as in-charge SP. The development set off speculation that the development is linked to the controversy over land deals in certain villages of the district – several plots of land, belonging to both farmers and government, were illegally transferred to private entities close to prominent politicians. The needle of suspicion rests on some mid-level bureaucrats and certain politicians – including a former minister – who have allegedly been trying to thwart the filing of FIRs in these cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/eyebrows-raised-over-kheda-sp-post/articleshow/87654172.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Drained of funds, most mucor patients put off rehab surgeries||Nagpur: It cost Navin Paul Rs1.5 crore to treat his mucormycosis infection after Covid. But he still ended up losing one eye and much of his facial bones, leading to severe disfigurement, and has now run out of resources to get the reconstructive surgery done. Paul is a mid-level state government employee. To treat mucormycosis, he got Rs1 crore from the railways, as his wife is employed there. The remaining Rs50 lakh was his own money. However, the railway scheme does not cover any procedure or reconstructive surgery to restore his face. There is no such plan with the state government either. Even the money for his artificial eye had come from his pocket, says Paul. No medical government scheme covers reconstructive surgeries, which are considered cosmetic procedures. Only the treatment is paid for, he says, adding that he may need another Rs8 lakh for the face reconstruction. Similarly, Abdul Sadik, a retired zilla parishad teacher, also suffered from Covid and mucor infection. With no insurance, and over Rs5 lakh already spent, the family has put the reconstructive surgery on hold, says his son Sajid. There are a number of such patients, who are already drained of funds from treating Covid and mucor infections, and left with disfigured faces due to removal of bones and eyes but no money for further treatment, say doctors. There is no government scheme which covers reconstructive procedures. Some insurance companies are providing the cover, however costly treatment of mucor itself has exhausted the cover of most patients, say doctors. It is learnt that the Government Dental College has sent a proposal to fund such procedures. A decision is awaited. Nagpur divisional commissioner Prajakta Lavangare said a proposal to use CSR money accumulated under Vidarbha Development Fund is also in process. A grant of Rs1 to Rs1.5 lakh may be given. The first priority is likely to be for economically weaker sections. Source say the average cost of treatment comes to around Rs3 lakh, with around 12 components used, where a single screw costs as much as Rs25,000. Senior dentist Dr Harish Rathi says a full reconstruction of the facial structure is possible through surgeries. It needs a rather thorough study on case to case basis. The cost is on the higher side because the material used has to be sustainable for a long term. Use of advanced technology also adds to the cost. Crowd funding can be one of the options to fund such treatment. A government scheme should also be introduced, he said. Dr Bipin Dehane, a maxillofacial surgeon, said as much as 40% to 50% patients have put their treatment on hold only because of financial constraints. It’s not just a cosmetic treatment. The prosthetics also have a functional use in the body. A number of minute aspects like the load bearing capacity has to be taken into account for implants. This is also a challenging task for doctors as each case as its own nuances. Among other cases, a farmer in Yavatmal say he is now left with just one acre of land after he sold 3 acres to meet the Rs28 lakh treatment cost. Unable to speak or chew properly, he is clueless about arranging more funds for treatment. Another state government employee said she is only waiting for a government scheme to get her husband’s surgery done.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/drained-of-funds-most-mucor-patients-put-off-rehab-surgeries/articleshow/87654880.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Civic bodies up the heat on non-veg street food vendors||VADODARA/RAJKOT: Though they have always been an eyesore in the state, Rajkot and Vadodara municipal corporations have of late issued directives to ensure that non-vegetarian street food carts stay ‘invisible’ to public eye. The first to crack the whip was the ruling BJP in Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) which orally ordered officers to remove street vendors selling non-vegetarian food and egg dishes from the main roads. A drive in this regard started in the city for the past two days, albeit there is no notification or official order issued to this effect. Officials, however, maintain that they are not specifically targeting non-veg food vendors but are taking action anywhere they receive a complaint of encroachment. Rajkot mayor Pradeep Dav himself started the drive after he got several complaints. Dav held meetings with some non-vegetarian food vendors before Diwali and instructed them to shift from the main roads. Dav told TOI, “I have asked officials to shift non-veg and egg ‘larris’ (carts) from major crossroads and those that park themselves near the temples. A majority of people feel disgusted while passing by these carts because of its smell and many also hang chicken outside.” Municipal commissioner Amit Arora said, “There is no specific instruction to remove non-veg carts. We remove all kinds of encroachment specifically where we get complaints of encroachment.” RMC has seized six carts selling non-veg food items in the past two days. There was a suggestion to develop a hawker zone specially for non-veg street vendors but for that RMC has found no suitable place. Like Rajkot, orders in Vadodara too are oral and no notification has been brought out so far. In Vadodara, chairman of the standing committee of Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC), Dr Hitendra Patel gave instructions in this regard to officials at a meeting on Wednesday evening. Patel, however, assured that the vendors will not be ousted. “We are asking the vendors to ensure that they do not hang or display non-vegetarian food. They will have to keep it covered,” said Patel. The chairman said that this was done to ensure that hygiene is maintained and sentiments are not hurt. At the other end, the state president of National Association of Street Vendors of India, Arvind Sindha, who is from Vadodara claimed that non-vegetarian food vendors had been asked to move away from main roads. “They have been told to move away from 30m and 18m roads,” he said. Refuting this allegation, Patel, however, said that the carts were only being asked to ensure they do not hamper traffic movement. “At times there is heavy rush at such places and leads to traffic problems,” he said. Meanwhile, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation standing committee chairman said, “We had in fact begun a campaign against non-veg food stalls selling without licences in front or near religious places. The campaign is still on and I will take a review of this shortly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/civic-bodies-up-the-heat-on-non-veg-street-food-vendors/articleshow/87654178.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: BPLR residents fight for wasted amenity space||PUNE: A patch of land near Regent Plaza in Baner has become a bone of contention between local residents and the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). While the land is marked as an amenity space in the city’s development plan, residents said that the area is being used for garbage segregation. As a result, the area stinks, especially after the rain. Stray dogs and cows roam the area, and it has also become a breeding site for mosquitoes, said residents, who demanded that the land patch be cleaned, and garbage segregation shifted to some other place. Complaints lodged with the PMC helpline have been “closed”, with the civic body maintaining that the area is cleaned daily by 12:30pm. Residents, however, described the PMC’s claim as “completely false”. Vinod Gupta, a resident of the area, said that despite many complaints, the civic body has not taken any action except providing false assurances. “Every time, the complaint has been closed stating that the area has been cleaned. They clean the central area and push all the waste to the corners. How is this a solution to the problem? This is literally an eyewash. The area should be cleaned after waste segration. They cannot put a big dump yard in the middle of a residential area. There are so many cases of dengue that we get to hear. This site is a breeding site for such mosquitoes. And it stinks horribly, especially after the rain,” said Gupta. Rajendra Chutar, president, Baner Pashan Link Road Welfare Trust, said that the matter has been discussed at every mohalla committee meeting. “First of all, waste segration should not happen in a residential area. What we want is complete removal of waste. Some hotels in nearby areas also dump waste at night, adding to the problem. The amenity space should be developed as a park or something useful and not for dumping waste,” said Chutar. Manish Mishra, another resident, said that a meeting was held with Swach representative who blamed the PMC for the collapse of their secondary system. “A few BPLR Welfare Trust members went to attend the PMC Mohalla Committee meeting and there, too, multiple issues regarding BPLR (garbage, streetlights, water, sterilisation of dogs, traffic signboards etc) were raised. On our insistence, deputy commissioner Sandip Khalate promised to visit our area soon. Post this meeting, we had a meeting with sanitary inspectors Jaya Sangde and Vijay Bhoir. A Swach representatives, too, was present. Both the parties blamed each other yet again. A joint meeting between the PMC, Swach and BPLR residents was agreed upon in next few days,” said Mishra. A PMC official said that the delay was due to fewer number of trips by dumpers due to issues in the plant. “There are some issues in solid waste processing plants due to which the dumpers which carry waste to the plants are unable to make multiple trips. So, if earlier they made three trips to empty the waste per day, now they are able to make only one such trip, leading to waste not being picked from segregating areas. We are trying to solve the issue.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bplr-residents-fight-for-wasted-amenity-space/articleshow/87654889.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Scale up Covid testing as detection halved in Diwali’||Pune: Covid detection tests in Maharashtra reduced to 5.6 lakh during Diwali in the November 3-9 week from an average of more than 10-11 lakh during the corresponding seven-day period in September and October. The recent number of weekly tests in the state was the lowest in the past two months. Public health officials attributed the drop to festivities as well as a consistent decline in Covid cases. The Maharashtra task force has now directed the government to scale up testing, especially in districts that have registered a higher weekly positivity than the state average (1.3%) as presented in the Cabinet on Wednesday. The public health department registered 3,23,150 RT-PCR and 2,35,813 rapid antigen tests between November 3 and 9 with 17 districts conducting less than 5,000 tests during the period. The highest weekly tests were registered from Mumbai (2.1 lakh), followed by Thane (85,033), Pune (63,044) and Raigad (26,455). The lowest weekly tests were registered in Bhandara (370). “Ten districts continued to register a higher weekly positivity than the state’s average and testing should be increased there. We cannot be complacent in testing. Districts that are continuing to see more active cases should conduct more tests,” said task force member Dr Shashank Joshi. State health minister Rajesh Tope had told TOI November would be “a crucial month”, as a lot of crowding was seen during recent festivities. As the state has the capacity to conduct 2-2.5 lakh tests, districts have been told to not reduce testing. Tope said tests had dropped due to low daily detections and fewer contacts to track. “We have told the districts to keep a close watch on the situation, especially after the festive season,” he said. Task force member Dr Rahul Pandit said the next two weeks are extremely important.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-scale-up-covid-testing-as-detection-halved-in-diwali/articleshow/87655448.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Nagpur||‘Diabetic patients must ensure regular check up to rule out retinopathy’||Nagpur: As India is already the diabetes capital of the world, and there were many new detections after second Covid wave, doctors have advised all diabetic patients to regularly get checked to rule out retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy is emerging as the biggest cause of blindness in the country. As many Covid patients discovered they were diabetic post-recovery, screening is the only way to diagnose diabetic retinopathy. Doctors said those detected with increased sugar levels must understand that it may not be the case that they were diabetic only due to use of steroids. Many patients are diabetic for a longer duration, probably five to six years more than they assume. An estimated 16% of all diabetic patients are believed to be affected by retinopathy. Eye surgeon Dr Gopal Arora said India is not going into sub-speciality of ophthalmology. “Diabetic retinopathy is one such specialty. A new telemedicine option is now available especially for diabetic retinopathy to help screen patients in remote parts of the country. Through teleopthalmology, we will be able to screen patients from big cities,” he said. Dr Arora said a lot of borderline or non-diabetics have suddenly been diagnosed as diabetics after Covid waves. “Some normalized after stopping steroids. But sugar level of not all reverted to normal. Such patients will remain diabetic. We get patients who say they were diagnosed with diabetes two months back. The detection was done two months back while they may have had the disorder for much longer,” he said, adding they need a check up to rule out retinopathy. Retina surgeon Dr Sandeep Anjankar said, “Some 20% of people are diabetic. Around 8% of them have retinopathy but remain undiagnosed. Around 5% have advanced diabetic retinopathy, which is near blindness. This is happening because diabetic patients are unaware that they have retinopathy. People only take medicines for diabetes or other related issues like cardiac or kidney. They approach us when suddenly they stop seeing.” Dr Anjankar added that retina is mirror to the brain. “If there is a problem on retina, patient may have problem in kidney, heart or brain. As compared to other complex procedures, retina check up is simple. Early detection can help vision or increase longevity of vision. In late stage, retinal detachment or vitreous haemorrage occurs,” he said. Endocrinologist Dr Pramod Gandhi said after Covid, a lot of people realised they have diabetes. “In our society, the number of people who don’t know they have diabetes is equal to the number of known diabetics. Probably, during Covid pandemic we have detected those patients. Confinement at home, lack of exercise, stress related to loss of job, weight gain etc precipitated diabetes.” “Diabetes retinopathy is a known complication. If diabetes remain uncontrolled forever, this is the most common cause of permanent blindness. Hence, people who recently discovered their diabetic condition must keep it in control to reduce chances of retinopathy,” Dr Gandhi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/diabetic-patients-must-ensure-regular-check-up-to-rule-out-retinopathy/articleshow/87654900.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Bullet bike gang mastermind sold 150 stolen bikes in Nepal||LUCKNOW: Shoaib Khan, the mastermind of ‘Bullet bike gang’ arrested after an encounter with police on Thursday, has allegedly sold over 150 bikes in Nepal. The accused has four theft cases in Lucknow and over 25 cases in adjoining districts. He was on the run from last one year. Police said that his two aides, Ajay alias Azhar and Dilshad, were arrested for bike lifting in July from Chowk. Additional Deputy Commissioner of police, North, Prachi Singh, said that Shoaib used to steal ‘bullet bikes’ in the wee hours which were parked unattended or in closed alleys outside, using a ‘smart key’ and sometimes breaking the locks. He then used to drive them to Nepal via Bahraich. Singh also said that all others who helped Shoaib in transporting the vehicle and his channel are being tracked. “The reason for stealing bullet bikes from UP and then selling them to Nepal is because in the neighbouring country, the price of ‘bullet’ bikes is around Rs 6 lakh while in Uttar Pradesh it is around Rs 2 lakh,” said Amit Sahu, sub-inspector with crime branch of Lucknow police. Sahu said that Shoaib and his gang members used to sell stolen bikes in Nepal for which they used to get a cut of Rs 25,000 per bike. Police officers said that Shoaib during interrogation revealed that he managed to sell seven bikes in Nepal in Diwali week. He also said that once the bike was delivered to Nepal, the other gang members used to tamper its registration and engine numbers using machines and then put new numbers before selling them to customers. Shoaib’s hometown is in Kanpur and he shifted to Gujarat for a few years with his in-laws before coming back to Lucknow and started stealing bullet bikes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bullet-bike-gang-mastermind-sold-150-stolen-bikes-in-nepal/articleshow/87655454.cms||---

---||Delhi||No coercive action against liquor retailers for not paying the licence fees||New Delhi: The AAP government on Thursday assured Delhi High Court that no coercive action will be taken against liquor retailers for the time being for not paying the licence fees under the new excise policy. The assurance came on a petition by over 16 retail liquor traders, the successful bidders for licences to operate retail liquor vends. They contested the decision of Delhi government to levy licence fees with effect from November 1. Appearing for the government, senior advocates AM Singhvi and Rahul Mehra said no coercive steps action will be taken against the traders for now since they are partners in the business. In view of the assurance, justice Rekha Palli listed the matter for further hearing on November 15 and added, “I hope you will abide by your statement”. On the court’s earlier query about the number of liquor brands where MRPs are fixed and those yet to be done, the government informed the court that out of the popular 30 brands, MRPs of 10 have been fixed. For another seven, the process would be completed in the next two days. During the hearing, the judge said, “You (Delhi government) started the policy with such fanfare, but these issues are yet to be ironed out. You should be a little pragmatic.” The new bidders also sought to restrain the government from demanding sums of money in the form of licence fees or security deposits and also to direct the authorities not to levy or demand licence fees from the successful bidders until the government performs its obligations under the tender terms and conditions. It also sought to postpone the date for the scheduled commencement of business from November 17. One of the bidders said the entire process — from the determination of MRP to retail sale — is a time-consuming exercise and if the scheduled date of start of business is November 17, as specified by the government, it is a complete breach of contract that there is delay in the registration of brands and determination of MRP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-coercive-action-against-liquor-retailers-for-not-paying-the-licence-fees/articleshow/87655467.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||2-yr period for lapse of land proceedings will not apply after new Act, rules SC||Nagpur: Quashing the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court’s verdict, the Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that the two-year period prescribed under the ‘Land Acquisition Act, 1894’ for lapse of acquisition proceedings for not delivering the compensation would not apply for award that took place after 2013 Act came into force. The HC had cancelled acquisition of 203.86 hectares made in 2011 for Gosikhurd project in Bhandara, after the villagers from Ambadi village approached it on July 27, 2017. The petitioners had prayed for quashing the compensation award of October 30, 2014, contending that as per the 1894 Act, it should have been passed within two years from the date of declaration, which was before August 8, 2014. The HC held that the October 30, 2014, award would be of no consequence, as the acquisition proceedings were lapsed. The Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation (VIDC) executive engineer working on the mega project then knocked the apex court’s doors. “The HC judgment of setting aside the award and holding that the acquisition proceedings had lapsed is set aside. It is held that the acquisition proceedings had not lapsed, and the award is legal and valid. The appeals are allowed in the aforesaid terms without any order as to costs,” a division bench comprising justices AM Khanwilkar and Sanjiv Khanna held. The bench made it clear that Section 25 of the ‘Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013’ would apply to the government’s award. “The period during which the HC order would inhibit action on the part of the authorities to proceed with the making of the award would be excluded while computing the period under Section 25. Accordingly, period of 79 days from May 26, 2014, when HC had stayed operation of the notification of March 19, 2014, till the new notification of August 13, 2014, was issued has to be excluded. The award purportedly dated October 30, 2014, was in any case duly made on or before the extended date of March 20, 2015. Hence, the concerned award is valid,” the top court said. The judges asked the Maharashtra government that it may conduct an inquiry in reference to the imputation regarding manipulation and backdating of the award and take remedial and corrective action as may be necessary and to ensure such situations do not arise in future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2-yr-period-for-lapse-of-land-proceedings-will-not-apply-after-new-act-rules-sc/articleshow/87654945.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra active cases/million is now below eight states||Pune: Maharashtra’s active cases per million population is now lower than at least eight states in India, fresh data from the state public health department reveals. The state’s active cases per million population as on November 9 were 105, lower than Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Mizoram, Telangana, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur and Meghalaya.Maharashtra’s additional chief secretary (health), Dr Pradeep Vyas, said, “Though Maharashtra has the second highest active cases in India in terms of absolute numbers, its actual disease burden is much lower than several other states if the number of Covid cases are calculated per million population.” A senior official with the state health department told TOI that calculating the number of cases per million was the scientific way to compare state-wise burden because different states had different populations. Maharashtra is the second-most populous state in India after Uttar Pradesh. “Absolute Covid-19 cases in various states cannot convey the real picture of the disease burden in a region. Hence, the per million population method is used. For instance, if 50 are infected in a population of 100 people in a state, the attack rate is 50% there. Similarly, if 20 out of 100 are infected in another state, the attack rate is 20%. Maharashtra’s population is nearly 13 crore — one of the highest among the states in India. When Covid-19 cases are calculated per million population, actual disease burden will drop much lower in comparison to several other regions,” the official said. Health department data showed Maharashtra’s active cases per million had also dropped below the national average of 116. As on October 26, Maharashtra’s active cases per million residents was 181, higher than the national average of 135. Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Telangana then had lower active cases per million population in comparison. State Covid-19 Task Force member Dr Shashank Joshi told TOI, “In the past, Maharashtra did have the second highest active Covid-19 cases per million population among other states. But the situation improved with a consistent drop in new Covid-19 cases. However, a word of caution: states such as Maharashtra and Kerala should not reduce their testing. Testing has gone down in both the states, which should be addressed as soon as possible. We may see a post-festive spike, thus the state needs to be vigilant.” Dr Joshi said Maharashtra still had some pockets where the virus was in circulation: urban hubs such as Mumbai, zones like Pune, Kolhapur, where Covid numbers suddenly shoot up and simmer down, as well as regions like Marathwada and Vidarbha. “The focus should be to vaccinate with at least one dose the over 2 crore eligible in Maharashtra who have not received the first vaccine shot. The state must also ensure it gets the second doses to those due, without any delay in the schedule. Test-trace-isolate programmes should be the other strategies despite a drop in active cases.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-active-cases/million-is-now-below-eight-states/articleshow/87655495.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Bapu Bhawan employee held for harassing woman staffer||LUCKNOW: A section in-charge at Bapu Bhawan was arrested from his Golf City residence in Lucknow on Thursday for sexually harassing a woman contractual employee and threatening to terminate her from service. The woman complainant works as a computer operator in the office where the accused is section in-charge. The accused was booked on October 29 and arrested after a video went viral on social media in which he was seen sexually harassing the woman. As per the survivor, she joined the job in 2013 on contractual basis at the office. The accused had been harassing her since 2018. “He had evil designs in his mind for me and I sensed it in the years I have been working there. I kept quiet and avoided his advances as I feared losing my job. He used to pass lewd comments at me regularly,” she alleged in her complaint after which an FIR was lodged. She also alleged that for the last one month, he became more bold due to her silence. “He made an indecent proposal asking me to meet him in the women’s toilet. I rebuked him at this and he threatened to terminate me from the job,” she alleged. She also claimed that he later sat close to her and asked her to agree to his proposal. “If you do not accept my proposal I will terminate you from the job. I will spoil your life and you will not be able to show your face in society. I love you and want to marry you,” the accused allegedly told the survivor. The survivor said she was frightened at the accused’s audacity. “I am being threatened to be killed for not accepting Yadav’s marriage proposal,” she alleged. Additional deputy commissioner, Central Zone, Raghvendra Mishra said that the accused was arrested under the charges of sexual harassment, singing obscene songs or reciting such words and criminal intimidation. “We had lodged a case on October 29 and a probe was being conducted in the case,” said Mishra.

Irked over ‘inaction’ despite multiple complaints, locals say there are severalstreets that are plunged into darkness after the sun sets. Improper illumination has led to several accidents in the past, alleged Bhupendra Singh Kathait, a city councillor. “On Wednesday, an elderly woman out on a morning walk was hit by a speeding vehicle in the Jakhan area, which is very poorly lit. Similarly, a two-wheeler had recently crashed into a truck. We have raised the issue many times but to no avail,” Kathait added. Locals allege that there are dark patches in several localities, which make it unsafe for early morning or late-night walkers. “I take the Sahastradhara road every day. The area has a canopy of trees and limited lights, some of which are non-functional. I am more worried about being hit by some vehicle. Now that the winter has set in, these streetlights should be repaired,” said Manoj Saraswat, a city resident working in IT park. While residential areas in the city don’t have an extensive problem, walkers in such locations want more safeguards in place. “Canal road has working lights but they are sparsely located and it would definitely be more convenient, especially for walkers to have more lights around. Even the road going to the airport has limited number of streetlights. These are frequented stretches and public safety should be the top priority in these locations,” said Yesh Veer Arya, a Canal road resident. The maintenance and functioning of streetlights have been outsourced by the municipal corporation. “The last time the residents raised concerns, we had written a letter of reprimand to the company, asking it to rectify any fault. We are working on finishing the streetlight work in all 100 wards. Later, focus will be on expansion,” said Rohitash Sharma, deputy municipal commissioner. Notably, a protest had been staged on November 1 and 2 at the DMC office to highlight the concern regarding faulty and non-functional streetlights. Residents had claimed that areas like Dilaram chowk, Jakhan, several parts of Rajpur road and Defence colony, among others did not have proper lighting, putting public safety at risk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/dysfunctional-streetlights-in-doon-raise-safety-concerns-irk-residents/articleshow/87654248.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

The team of doctors led by head of pediatric surgery department of KGMU, Prof SN Kureel, and comprising Dr Archika Gupta and Dr Sunil Kanoujia is credited with the discovery. The achievement in the field of exstrophy-epispadias has been included in ‘Thieme Medical Publisher’ —an American German medical and science publisher. Exstrophy-epispadias is one the most serious birth defects involving one baby in 10,000 births where the urinary bladder and urethra of penis are turned inside out accompanied with constant urine leak. "Results after multistage surgery done in a span of 3-5 years for this congenital defect were not very encouraging. The research conducted by Prof Kureel and his team new anatomical facts were discovered based on which a new surgical technique of single stage total reconstruction was developed. This new technique showed remarkable improvement in results in terms of urine control and aesthetics," said an official press statement from KGMU on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kgmu-surgeon-wins-global-acclaim/articleshow/87655475.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Killer father signs away right to custody of love child||GANDHINAGAR: Sachin Dixit, the father of Shivam (name changed), the cherubic boy with angelic smile and innocent face whose abandonment shocked the state and unravelled the grisly murder of his mother, has relinquished legal rights to the custody of his son, social justice and empowerment department officials said. Sunaina Tomar, additional chief secretary, social justice and empowerment, said the father signed an affidavit giving up his right to legal custody of his son some ten days ago. “He will be given up to two months time to reconsider his decision, of which 10 days have passed. If he reiterates his decision, a process will be undertaken so that the child can be adopted through the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA),” Tomar said. CARA is an autonomous and statutory body of the union ministry of women and child development in the Government of India and functions as a nodal body for the adoption of Indian children. A month ago, Shivam was abandoned by a man at the Swaminarayan Gurukul Gaushala at Pethapur. The case captured the interest of the public and ministers alike and Gandhinagar police cracked the case within hours, revealing that the child had been abandoned by his father who had first murdered his partner and Shivam’s mother, Mehendi, in Vadodara. While the father was sent to judicial custody, Shivam was sent to the Odhav Shishu Gruh run by the state government. The child’s paternal and maternal grandparents did not evince any interest in his custody. With his mother dead, the father giving up custody rights will pave the way for his adoption. Sources in the social justice and empowerment department said the child’s maternal aunt regularly comes to the Shishu Gruh asking to meet the child. She is keen on taking custody of him. “As the child has already undergone a lot at a very young age. It will not be good for his mental health if the aunt is allowed to meet him. Also, this is the second marriage of the aunt. Generally, CARA follows very rigorous eligibility criteria for adoption to ensure the child gets the most emotionally and financially stable family to thrive in,” said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/killer-father-signs-away-right-to-custody-of-love-child/articleshow/87654246.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Ban up in smoke, garbage burning in the open choking lungs of Lucknow||LUCKNOW: Burning of garbage in the open continues in the city despite it being one of the major factors responsible for the spike in air pollution levels. Lucknow Municipal Corporation had prohibited garbage burning about four years ago with a provision of slapping a fine of Rs 5,000 on those caught violating the ban. The rule also provided for deducting a day’s wage from the civic body’s sanitary workers as penalty, if they were found burning garbage in the open. However, TOI in its reality check found that open garbage burning by workers and people is still in practice in areas like Lalbagh, Latouche Road, Rajajipuram, Mahanagar, Naka Hindola, Madiaon, Aliganj, Jankipuram, Gomtinagar, Daliganj and a few other areas. In winters, such activities cause more air pollution because smoke combines with tiny water droplets in mist or fog to form smog which remains suspended in the atmosphere for long. TimesViewA collective effort involving various civic agencies and people is required to stop the practise of burning garbage in the open. While LMC needs to build a mechanism of regular monitoring so that those violating the ban are penalised, people should voluntarily abstain from such activities and even stop others from doing it because air pollution harms one and all.Residents complain of heavy breathing, nasal congestion and headache due to air pollution caused by garbage burning. Some also claimed that their complaints to the LMC helpline in this regard have gone unheard so far. Sunil Srivastava (65), Mahanagar, said that he has stopped going for morning walks because of the problem. “Since I am diabetic and have lung issues, morning walk has been recommended by the doctor, but instead of fresh air, we get smoke in the morning. Sanitary workers after sweeping the street, put dry leaves and garbage on fire, instead of carrying them to the nearest dumping yard,” he added. “I feel suffocated everyday because of garbage burning outside my home. I don’t know if the neighbours or sanitary workers are doing it. The authorities concerned should take some strict measures to stop this,” said Shubham Chaturvedi, resident of Jiamau, Gomtinagar. Several residents at Latouche Road pointed out wires and cycle tubes are also burnt by some in the area. Anuj Verma, a resident, said, “This area has lots of electronics and cycle repair shops, all the waste from them is thrown on roads and later burnt by the sweepers in the morning. Our locality has three patients suffering from asthma, but they don't care.” Additional municipal commissioner Abhay Pandey said, “If any worker is found to be burning garbage, then their salaries will be deducted. Citizens can also lodge complaints regarding garbage burning on “Lucknow One” app so we can take action on the offenders."

These measures, according to officials, have been taken under the micro plan to reach out to the maximum eligible recipients. Teams have been asked to visit their allotted villages and blocks by 9am and compile the data on Google sheet. Moreover, senior health officials — from senior medical officer (SMO) to additional chief medical officers (ACMOs) — have been directed to review the drive in rural areas. Till now, a total of 37,36,188 people, including 19,87,224 males, 17,47,300 females and 1,664 transgenders, have been given jabs in Prayagraj district. Senior Medical Officer (SMO) D. Anupam Dwivedi told TOI, “We are reaching out to eligible recipients, particularly in remote village areas, who are still left for vaccination.” He said: “Vaccination teams are now visiting Mazara and remote villages to cover the recipients. Special camps are being held at primary schools to cover recipients of all age groups.” In 10 days of November alone, 1,42,539 people, including 68,778 males, 48 transgenders and 73,313 females, have been administered Covid shot. Officials are making sincere efforts to reach out to the maximum rural population and for that ground level health workers — ASHA and ANMs — are conducting door-to-door survey . District immunisation officer and additional chief medical officer, Dr Teerath Lal told TOI, “Out of 37,36,188 doses given so far, 27,96,356 recipients have received the first dose while 9,39,832 have got both.” He added, “The department has set a target to cover 45,16,437 recipients in the district and about 83 percent of recipients have been given either first or second dose till now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/rural-areas-trail-health-dept-to-take-up-covid-vax-drive-in-two-shifts/articleshow/87654251.cms||Kapil Dixit

The signing took place in Glasgow at the United Nations Conference on Climate Change COP26. The state EV Policy, which was approved in July this year, aims to have a 10% share of electric vehicles in total registrations by 2025. It also targets conversion of 15 % of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) fleet into electric by 2025. The policy provides fiscal incentives for EV buyers and for their manufacturers along with subsidies for creation of charging infrastructure. As per a press release by the state government, RMI is a 40-year-old non-profit working on clean energy transitions globally. “In Maharashtra, RMI has already been engaging with city of Pune through its City EV Accelerator platform to make Pune EV-ready. We look forward to further our partnership on electric mobility, ZEV, hydrogen fuel and decarbonisation our transport sector and urban renewal sector” said state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray at the signing of the MoU. Highlighting the need to mobilize climate finance, CEO of RMI Jule Kortenhorst said, “Maharashtra is showing the leadership for climate action by sub-national governments. The size and scale of economic growth in the state provides it the unique opportunity to leapfrog to clean and modern energy systems and be the role model for sub-national governments, not just in India, but globally.” Meanwhile, Thackeray was invited by the UNFCCC high-level champions for a one-on-one chat with the First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon who “commended the sheer scale at which Maharashtra government is working to decarbonise the state”. During the interaction, the minister emphasized that it will be up to the administrative officers and elected representatives across all tiers of the government to lead and inspire sustainable development for Maharashtra. He further announced that the Maharashtra Council for Climate Change will convene to chart out a decarbonisation pathway for the state, under the chairmanship of the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. “Climate is karma, it will do to you what you do to the planet. It will not discriminate between the developing and developed. It will hit us all regardless of who or where we are,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/maha-signs-mou-with-us-org-for-ev-policy-tech-support/articleshow/87654962.cms||Manka Behl

Senior NU officials told TOI that despite their opposition to release dues of the ‘blacklisted’ company, vice-chancellor Subhash Chaudhari had gone ahead under “obvious political pressure” from political leaders in Mumbai having their stake in the Pune company. Fed up with its miserable services, Chaudhari’s predecessor SP Kane had decided to oust MKCL from the university and also stopped its dues worth around Rs3.60 crore in 2015-16, as claimed by MKCL. NU had purchased 32 lakh shares of the company that time. TOI had been tracking the MKCL’s entry and exit by exposing on how it miserably failed to provide services in various universities, which then ousted it and some even put it into the blacklist. It recently reported on how VC had decided to re-introduce MKCL, ignoring stiff opposition from the statutory members. Chaudhari did not pick up TOI’s repeated calls or respond to text messages as usual. Even MKCL mentor and former chairman Vivek Sawant too failed to respond. The Pune company had agreed to provide 14 services as per pact in 2005-06. It had proposed to build an interactive web-portal which will have large applications like exam forms, results, online tutorials, university news, and important educational links, on the lines of other big portals. The company charged Rs50 from NU’s four lakh students under its ‘e-suvidha’ project since beginning but failed to start the services. Subsequently, NU held up its payments worth Rs1.64 crore. Following NU’s reluctance to pay Rs3.60 crore dues for over three years, MKCL snapped ties and withdrew services. Subsequently, NU’s web portal where students used to get their admission cards, enrolment numbers and hall tickets was also stopped that time leading to a complete mess. Due to MKCL’s move, the exam work, especially generation of hall-tickets and of results, was also severely affected. Other companies like Promarc came to NU’s rescue by doing the same work in just one fourth price. According to NU officials, MKCL outsourcing the work to a franchisee was the root cause of all controversies. The outsourcing clause was not mentioned in the agreement. MKCL’s franchisee coordinator had dispatched over 100 reminders to NU for payment of dues that he claimed swelled to Rs 3.60 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ignoring-opp-from-own-officials-nu-releases-rs1-37cr-mkcls-dues/articleshow/87654254.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Officials of the education department have ordered a probe into the incident. The principal of Jageshwar Inter college, Neura in Magraura block in Pratapgarh district has been accused of writing the remark. When the family members of the victim made efforts to know about the reason behind writing the derogatory words on the transfer certificate, the principal refused to entertain them, saying that the student would not get admission in any college of the country. District Inspector of School (DIOS) Pratapgar, Sarvadanand told TOI that the matter came to the notice of the education department officials through IGRS portal. The DIOS further added that a detailed probe has been ordered and action would be initiated once the probe report comes in. He, however, said that putting such remark on the transfer certificate of any student was not justified. He said that officials are probing the facts related to the issue and action would be initiated. He also claimed that he had talked to college authorities regarding the issue and the matter would be solved soon. Initial reports claimed that two groups of students were at loggerheads on college campus on October 27 and following the incident, school authorities had initiated action and punished some errant students, including the victim. The victim student, who was allegedly punished with other students, had sought the transfer certificate from the college authorities after having a disagreement with them and the principal of the college had allegedly written the remark on his TC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/principal-writes-objectionable-remark-on-students-tc-edu-dept-orders-probe/articleshow/87654256.cms||---

---||Delhi||Separate annual licence for serving liquor at banquet halls, farmhouses, motels||New Delhi: There is no need to get a temporary P-10 license to serve liquor at weddings, parties or other events at banquet halls, farmhouses, motels, party places and other such venues. Under the Delhi government’s new excise policy, licensed venues can now get an annual L-38 license for a fee ranging from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 15 lakh, based on its carpet area. The P-10 license allows the serving of Indian liquor and foreign liquor at premises that do not have the licence. The fee was Rs 15,000 per event for farmhouses and banquet halls. The new L-38 license, however, would now be mandatory for venues that conduct multiple events. Venues with a carpet area of up to 5,000 square feet will have to pay an annual fee of Rs 5 lakh. For sites with carpet areas between 5,000 and 15,000 square feet, the fee would be Rs 10 lakh, and Rs 15 lakh would be the cost for venues with a carpet area above 15,000 square feet. The entire rented area will be calculated, including all the floors where events are held in a venue with multiple floors. As per an order regarding the terms and conditions for grant of licenses in form L-38 for liquor service at licensed premises, no separate P-10 license will be required for events once the yearly license is acquired. The L-38 license holder will have to issue a letter mentioning the date of the event, the number of guests and such other details to the host of the event to enable them to procure the liquor from a licensed source in Delhi. Also, the licensee is not allowed to sell or deliver any liquor to any person under the age prescribed by the Delhi Excise Act. The licensee also can’t keep, distribute, or sell any advertising material that is likely or intended to promote the sale or consumption of liquor. They also can’t display any bottle containing liquor or even an empty liquor bottle or specimen in a show window, except at the bar counter. Venues like farmhouses, banquet halls and motels with an L-38 licence will be allowed to host any entertainment activities such as live singing performances by professionals, dancing, karaoke and live bands. However, the host of the event will have to produce the purchase invoice if demanded by excise officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/separate-annual-licence-for-serving-liquor-at-banquet-halls-farmhouses-motels/articleshow/87655525.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Kolkata||‘BJP fascism’ kicked out film from IFFI: Bratya||Kolkata: Bratya Basu’s ‘Dictionary’ has got embroiled in a controversy of spelling errors at its Indian Panorama selection for the 52nd edition of Indian International Film Festival (IFFI) that begins in Goa on November 20. While the apparent reason for sudden exclusion of the film after being included from the Indian Panorama list has been attributed to a spelling error of his name, Basu doesn’t rule out political vendetta. In a congratulatory letter to the director and producer of ‘Dictionary’ on November 5, Directorate of Film Festivals additional director general Chaitanya Prasad invited both for its screening on November 22 at 10am. The letters also had details about their to-and-fro travel plans to Goa and also requested nominations of two members of the cast to be present as guests. According to instructions, producer Firdausul Hasan sent one DCP, two Blu Rays and two DVD copies of the film. However, on November 6, Directorate of Film Festivals/International Film Festival of India deputy director Tanu Rai sent a letter to Film Federation of India (FFI), saying that “a serious technical flaw” has been observed “wherein in the FFI recommendation letter the name of the director of the Bengali film ‘Dictionary’ is different from the application form and credit title of the film”. He had referred to the letter FFI general secretary had sent to Indian Panorama on August 4 this year, nominating ‘Dictionary’ for consideration which had misspelt the director’s name as ‘Dutta Basu’ instead of Bratya Basu. In his letter to FFI, Rai said: “In view of the said discrepancy, the selection of the film in Indian Panorama stands null and void. Hence the film shall not be part of Indian Panorama official selection. It is hereby requested that the director and producer of the film may kindly be informed about the same. Any invitation extended on behalf of this film is also withdrawn. In view of the aforesaid, FFI may like to recommend fresh films for Mainstream Cinema Section as per the regulations and will be examined as per rules. This has the approval of ADG, DFF.” A new press release was issued on November 6 where ‘Dictionary’ was excluded. At the press conference, Basu said such reasons for exclusion smack of “political vendetta” and “BJP’s fascism”. He didn’t rule out chances that initial appreciation of the film happened without the jury being aware of his political identity. “I am a member of Trinamool. Mamata Banerjee is my leader. I will not stop my protests against BJP because of this incident. I will continue doing the work that I have been doing in both my political and cultural space. Trinamool will be in power in Goa. My leader has gone there. I will go there too.” Meanwhile, Hasan said that errors, if any, ought to have been checked before the initial announcements were made. “Such exclusion for no fault of mine is hugely demoralizing. Since I made no mistake in the forms I filled up, why am I being made a victim for the typing error of someone else?” Hasan asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-fascism-kicked-out-film-from-iffi-bratya/articleshow/87654265.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Allahabad||AU VC proposes setting up museum of varsity stalwarts||Prayagraj: With the aim of discouraging migration of meritorious students to other cities for pursuing higher studies, Allahabad University authorities have decided to establish a museum to showcase its noted alumni to the students so that they are encouraged to pursue studies at this fourth oldest university of the country. “I am pained to see that many of the young students of the city are not aware of the ‘glorious past’ of AU or for that matter about the great personalities of the country who have studied at this great institution,” said AU vice-chancellor Prof Sangita Srivastava. “While we are making all efforts to provide the best facilities, both in terms of academics and sports to our students, they should also have a feeling of ‘self-pride’ while studying at AU. This could be possible only when they are well-informed about the glorious past of the university and the great names it has produced,” she added. The VC further told TOI, “For making the students, both who are already enrolled on the campus and also those who would become part of AU in coming years, aware with regard to the glorious past of AU and also who all were the world-renowned personalities that AU had produced, this museum has been conceptualised.” AU stalwarts, ranging from late President Shankar Dayal Sharma to late Prime Ministers Chandra Shekhar and VP Singh and the former five-time Prime Minister of Nepal Surya Bahadur Thapa besides noted poets and writers like Firaq Gorakhpuri and Harivansh Rai Bachchan as well as scientists like noted astrophysicist Meghnad Saha among others, would be a part of the proposed museum. The museum would be established at one of the halls of building near the historical Vizayanagram Hall of the science faculty campus of the Central varsity. Although the museum would have busts or murals of these stalwarts, it would be decided in due course of time as AU has to garner funds for this proposed museum. “We would have to arrange funds for establishing the museum which aims to motivate students of the city to pursue higher education and research at AU and not move to other cities. The funds could come through corporate social responsibility (CSR),” said Prof Srivastava. There are educational institutions across the world which have similar museums and even have tickets for visiting the museum. Why can’t we have something here at AU which too has produced legendary figures in all spheres, she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/au-vc-proposes-setting-up-museum-of-varsity-stalwarts/articleshow/87654267.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Video of BJP MP losing cool on not finding her photo at PMC goes viral||Revised Prayagraj: A video of Prayagraj MP Rita Bahuguna Joshi getting upset over her photograph, and of another former mayor of the city, being missing from the wall of the Prayagraj Municipal Corporation, and pulling up officials concerned has gone viral on the social media. The incident is said to be of Tuesday during the house meeting of PMC when the MP lost her cool on finding her photograph missing and snapped saying that all photographs on display are of leaders who have passed away (sporting garlands) and not a single photograph of a leader alive has been put on display. “I was shocked to see how disorganised they are. The walls did not have a picture of any of the former mayors of the city, be it Shyama Charan Gupta, Jitendra Nath Singh or myself. On being asked, I was told that the pictures have been damaged by termites. If that was the case, they could have put a new picture or could have asked us. But that was brazen on their part of not having a picture of former mayors” said BJP MP, Rita Joshi while talking to TOI. She further said, “Look for example how organised the administration of Hindustani Academy is, but here at PMC, they had pictures of leaders who have passed away, garlands hanging from the photo frame. I have suggested placing the picture of our respected posthumous leaders at one wall and that of the former mayors on one wall. It would then look more organised.” Commenting on the issue, public relation officer of PMC and tax officer, PK Mishra said, “It was just that the respected MP had pointed out that that pictures of former mayors were not to be seen and we told her that since the pictures have been damaged because of termites and the sadan is being renovated, fresh pictures would be placed on the walls in due course of time”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/video-of-bjp-mp-losing-cool-on-not-finding-her-photo-at-pmc-goes-viral/articleshow/87654274.cms||---

Nadda arrived in Mumbai on Thursday evening and spoke to BJP leaders and workers at a welcome event in Andheri (East). “We always take forward nationalist ideals under the leadership of PM Modi, and are strengthening the country. We have also vowed to take Maharashtra forward. “The weather is not the same all the time... When the sun is hidden, nationalist powers are a little hurt for some time but this doesn’t mean that nationalist powers won’t go forward with full power. They will, and in the days to come, in Maharashtra too, the BJP’s flag will fly high,” Nadda said after landing in Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bjp-will-uproot-corrupt-govt-in-a-democratic-way-in-mumbai-nadda/articleshow/87655892.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Kolkata||Mother-son duo performs at UN climate summit||Kolkata: The mother-son duo of Sohini Roychowdhury and Rishi Dasgupta performed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow on Thursday. In a world ravaged by the pandemic, this two-week summit is a critical test of global cooperation to address the climate crisis. Describing her invitation to perform on the sidelines as part of COP26 cultural expressions as the “turning point” of her life, the Bharatnatyam dancer and choreographer said: “I was approached by Tami Pein who is the COP26 Events and Venue Coordinator of Stop Climate Chaos Scotland. This invitation means the world to me and I am honoured to be performing at the most important climate-related conference on the planet.” This is the first time the mother and son performed together at a physical event. The venue — an iconic Baroque church called Adelaide Place — was also special for the duo. “The church was founded in 1829 and the present church building dates from 1877. As a Kolkatan, I feel proud that my son and I have received this opportunity,” she added. Dasgupta is currently studying economics at St Andrews University in Scotland. “I'm in a new place but with familiar faces. So, in a way, it feels nostalgic as well as new and exciting,” Dasgupta said. Roychowdhury believes her long association with ‘Nature and I’ projects might have influenced her selection as one of the performers. This project has been presented in the form of dance workshops, concerts and storytelling with dance formats both in Kolkata and various cities of Europe. The 20-minute-long programme saw the duo perform a version of ‘Nature and Us’ by using Shiva stotrams. “There is an umbilical connection between Purush and Prakriti. Exploring this connection is perhaps the best tribute we could have given to the central thought of COP26,” she said. Once the programme was over, the audience reaction left Roychowdhury overwhelmed. "People from all over the world, including children, attended our performance. It was such an emotional moment for me to see so many connecting with our art form," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mother-son-duo-performs-at-un-climate-summit/articleshow/87654294.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Pune||Another new low for the date as minimum temp dips to 10.9°C||Pune: The city experienced its coldest morning of the season on Thursday with the minimum temperature sliding to 10.9° celsius from Wednesday’s 11.8° celsius, the lowest in comparison to any other location in Maharashtra, India Meteorological Department data showed. Thursday’s minimum temperature in Shivajinagar was almost five degrees below the normal. Shivajinagar was also among the locations in India which are currently experiencing the lowest minimum temperatures (barring hill stations). The minimum temperature on Thursday was also Pune’s second lowest November minimum since 2017 when it was 11.4 on November 13. On November 12 in 2020, the minimum temperature had dropped to 9.8° celsius, the lowest November minimum since 2017. Thursday’s minimum was thus the second lowest November night temperature since then. The lowest minimum temperature of 9.5°C was reported at Raisen (West Madhya Pradesh) over the plains . Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting division, IMD, Pune told TOI, “After the passage of a recent western disturbance over North India, the wind direction changed causing cold north-easterly winds to penetrate into parts of North Madhya Maharashtra and neighbourhood. The winds were passing through the cold regions of Madhya Pradesh before entering Maharashtra, causing minimums to drop in many parts of the state.” However, the depression over southwest and adjoining west-central Bay of Bengal, which was likely to cross north Tamil Nadu and adjoining south Andhra Pradesh coasts close to Chennai on Thursday evening/night would cause clouding, thunder, light rain activity in parts of southcentral and South Maharashtra during the next few days, causing minimum temperatures to rise significantly here, even in Pune. “As per IMD’s extended range forecast for the next two weeks, the chill may be missing from Maharashtra till around November 25 owing to several weather conditions, including the likely formation of a fresh low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/another-new-low-for-the-date-as-minimum-temp-dips-to-10-9c/articleshow/87654289.cms||Neha Madaan

The accused, Ramnagesh Akubathini, claimed that he posted the threats to the cricketer’s Twitter handle after there was an exchange of words between two groups — one supporting the cricketer and the other GappistanRadio— which the techie supports. Akubathini told the cyber police at the Bandra-Kurla Complex where he will be in police custody till November 15 that he regretted his action. If convicted, he could be jailed for a maximum period of three years with a fine of Rs five lakh for publishing or transmitting material depicting children in the sexually explicit act in electronic form. DCP (Mumbai-Cyber) Rashmi Karandikar said a case was filed against Akubathini last week with the Delhi police on a complaint from the Delhi Commission for Women after the accused posted the tweet. Akubathini, a state topper and an IIT pass out from Hyderabad, was part of the group that had an exchange of words with another group after India lost the T20 World Cup match on October 24 against arch-rival Pakistan. “Akubathini, who worked with a Bengaluru-based startup, had constantly altered his profile on social media to troll the cricketer before he was finally tracked down,” said cyber police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/rape-threats-to-cricketers-child-remand-for-hyd-techie-in-mumbai/articleshow/87655948.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Mumbai||Student suicides up 11% in Maharashtra in 2020, but fewer ‘exam failure’ victims||MUMBAI: Keeping with the national trend of suicides among students increasing in the Covid year of 2020, Maharashtra also saw an uptick in the numbers from 2019. The state has the dubious record of registering the highest suicides among students. The latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report showed that 1,648 students in Maharashtra died by suicide in 2020. Odisha (1,469), Madhya Pradesh (1,158) and Tamil Nadu (930) were the other states with high student suicides. Though many believe the Covid-hit 2020 was relatively easier on the academic front due to cancelled or curtailed examinations, more students than ever before ended their lives in the state. The 2020 tally of 1,648 was higher (11%) than the previous years: 1,487 in 2019, 1,448 in 2018, 1,437 in 2017 and 1,350 in 2016. The nationwide tally of death by suicide among students stood at 12,526, about 21% more than the 2019 toll of 10,335. “Among all Indian states, Maharashtra has always registered the highest suicides among students because it is a ‘metropolitan state’ with high aspirations and high expectations,” said psychiatrist Harish Shetty. A public hospital doctor said the numbers are higher than in other states because of better reporting in the public health system. Psychiatrist Kersi Chavda contended that the biggest cause for suicide in any age group continues to be depression. “Some students struggle to cope,” he said, adding that the pandemic worsened the pitch for many. “In the last two years, due to Covid’s strong effect on the economy, many people with largely balanced lives ended up with not-so-balanced lives. People developed relationship issues, economic hardships, and students also had anxiety over future education or admission,” he said. For its accidental deaths and suicides report, the NCRB collates data under the heads of causes, such as “bankruptcy or indebtedness”, “marriage issues”, “failure in exams”, and so on. Maharashtra again topped the “failure in exams” category in 2020. Across the country, there was a 25% drop in deaths by suicide due to “failure in exams” — from 2,744 in 2019 to 2,080 in 2020. In Maharashtra, too, 287 students killed themselves for that reason compared to 439 in 2019 and 390 in 2018. Experts explained that studies are not the only reason for students to take their lives. “Indians don’t want to discuss parenting as an issue. But in 2020, many youngsters had a harrowing time because they were confined to home with parents who had different ideologies,” said psychologist Varkha Chulani. Youngsters not only had to deal with interpersonal strife, but also some harsh economic developments. The lack of access to a mental health support system, especially in non-metro areas, often worsens emotional turmoil among youngsters, added Shetty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-student-suicides-up-11-in-state-in-20-but-fewer-exam-failure-victims/articleshow/87655559.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Nagpur||Like polio, door-to-door Covid vax drive across Nagpur from November 20||NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has planned a massive door-to-door 10-day Covid vaccination drive on the lines of polio campaign from November 20 to attain the last mile coverage. The zilla parishad has already deployed teams in rural parts to reach out to unvaccinated people. The initiatives are part of Har Ghar Dastak drive launched as per central and state government orders. Though different measures are in place to incentivize vaccination, authorities are leaving nothing to chance to reach out to every citizen in the district. Both the local bodies have made vaccination a must for entry in public offices, to avail government schemes and use public utilities. Similar measures have been adopted in each of the 11 districts in Vidarbha to complete the first dose of eligible population by November 30. In Chandrapur, the civic body has initiated a bumper vaccination draw awarding LED TV, fridge, washing machine, etc to woo beneficiaries beside curbing movement of unvaccinated persons. In Amravati, Muslim maulavis were urged by municipal commissioner to create awareness about vaccination among community members. The number of doses at different vaccination centres have been increased between 300 and 500 there. In Nagpur, over 600 teams would be fanning out across the city under ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ drive to inoculate unvaccinated citizens with the first dose. An estimated seven lakh people in the district are yet to take their first dose. The NMC has been running door-to-door drive but not covering every home in the city. The drive was limited to areas having poor vaccination percentage. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI a plan similar to the polio campaign has been drawn. “Polio campaign spans five days as neighbours help health workers in tracing kids. ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ will take around 10 days as teams will have to confirm by actually enquiring at each house,” he said. He further said that all civic health staffers would be deployed along with malaria and filaria teams. “Nursing colleges too have been requested to help us with volunteers. Asha workers will also join. Around 550 to 600 teams each having a health worker and non-clinical person will spread out in the city. One medical officer will supervise 10 to 15 teams in each area,” he said. The NMC has enough doses and it has been assured of continuous supply to meet the requirement. Joshi further said that the warning about stopping the free first dose from December 1 has helped increase vaccination. “We aim to complete first dose in this drive but if someone is due for second dose it will also be given. Later, citizens can visit any centre for second dose,” he said. Zilla Parishad CEO Yogesh Kumbhejkar said they are already reaching out to low performing blocks at district health officer level. “We are holding camps at different rural places. Depending on specific area need, the camp would be extended there under ‘Har Ghar Dastak’,” said the CEO. According to Kumbhejkar, industries, housing societies and educational institutions with high number of unvaccinated or those with second dose are being covered. “All departments are coordinating and instructions have been given to taluka-level Covid task force to assist health workers. We are aiming to complete the overall backlog,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/like-polio-door-to-door-covid-vax-drive-across-city-from-nov-20/articleshow/87655016.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Kolkata||Health priority for MP funds, courtesy Covid||Kolkata: Bengal MPs cutting across party lines want to do their bit in the Covid battle with the Rs 2-crore MPLAD fund which is likely to be released before March 2022. Ironically, it was due to Covid that the MPLAD funds were halted by the Centre in 2020 for managing health services and Covid impacts. Kolkata South MP Mala Ray cites a personal example. "Before the funds were halted, I had used part of my 2019-20 allocation to procure, among other things, eight ambulances and five hearse vans. During the pandemic, these were used by KMC. It helped people in distress. If permitted, I would like to do more to help the state, and KMC, in its Covid battle,” Ray says. Jadavpur MP and actor Mimi Chakraborty highlighted the problems faced. “For the last one and a half years, we could not spend anything as the MPLAD funds got halted. Common people do not understand the nuances, but they feel that the MP has not responded to their needs. I am happy that I can start working on the schemes again,” she said. Barasat MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar said most part of her 2019-20 funds was spent to convert Barasat hospital into a medical college. “I will use for health and conservancy purpose in my constituency,” she said. Krishnagore MP Mahua Moitra is among the few leaders who will be able to spend more than the Centre’s MPLAD allocation. “Before the embargo, I had submitted my utilisation certificates for Rs 2.5 crore for 2020-21. This was sanctioned. I expect another Rs 2 crore to be released soon,” she said. “Rs 2 crore is not a big amount, but I am very keen to take up small projects like bus shelter, ambulance or a room for any school. But the MPs need cooperation from the local administration before that,” said BJP’s national vice-president and Midnapore MP Dilip Ghosh. Bengal BJP president and Balurghat MP Sukanta Majumdar said: “There are projects related to water supply that are crucial to my constituency. We have started work on those projects. We have given money to rural hospitals for buying generators, halls, or rooms for doctors.” CPM Rajya Sabha MP Bikash Bhattacharya said: “Until I get any fund I cannot comment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/health-priority-for-mp-funds-courtesy-covid/articleshow/87654302.cms||Rohit Khanna

Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) data shows that as many as 9,30,754 people in the city remain partially vaccinated. Of this, 2,58,314 beneficiaries are overdue by more than six weeks for their second dose.

The civic body also converted five AMTS and one BRTS bus into mobile vaccination centres. The civic body started doorstep vaccination service for those who were physically challenged or aged 50 and above. “Despite all our efforts, it is very unfortunate that the city still has over 9 lakh people who have shown carelessness by not taking their second dose. At a time when we are witnessing a surge in Covid cases in other states in the country, this definitely is not the time to show such negligence,” said a senior AMC official. The official said that the highest number of overdue vaccinated people, 1,60,192, are from North Zone that includes areas such as Sardarnagar, Krishnagar, Saijpur, Naroda and Kubernagar. “The second highest number of people who have not yet taken their second dose are residents of West Zone where 1,52,890 are yet to take the second vaccine dose,” the official said.

The official said that as of November 11, AMC has administered a total of 73.84 lakh vaccine doses in the city out of which 46.91 lakh were first doses while the remaining 26.93 lakh were second doses of vaccine. “To increase second dose coverage we have now decided against allowing people entry to AMC-run public facilities and will also request other private organizations to do the same,” the official said. He added that those who have not taken the second dose and want to will be directed to the nearest booth to take their second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/9-3-lakh-eligible-amdavadis-yet-to-take-their-second-jab/articleshow/87654340.cms||---

After discontinuing the practice in the last week of May, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation brought back the practice of setting up micro containment zones on Thursday as Gujarat and Ahmedabad marked an upward trend in cases for the second consecutive day with 40 and 14 cases respectively. The new micro containment zone contains as many as 20 houses with 85 residents, all in one block of a five-storeyed apartment. “One or two family members from each floor have tested Covid positive so we have decided to declare the block as a micro containment zone. We have also decided to resume the practice of announcing micro containment zones as we go further,” an AMC official said. The official said that the practice of declaring micro containment zones was discontinued in May when positive cases in the city had started showing a decline after peaking in April. The city had recorded the peak in the number of Covid cases in April. On April 25, the city had recorded 5,790 Covid cases — the highest. This had come down to 803 positive cases on May 21.

This shot up to 41 in the past two days, nearly doubling it. The test positivity rate (TPR) on Thursday stood at 0.07%, meaning 7 in every 10,000 persons tested turned out positive. In the state, out of the total Covid cases, 27 or slightly more than two-thirds of the cases were recorded from municipal corporation areas. The new cases include 14 from Ahmedabad city, 6 from Vadodara city, 4 from Surat city, 3 each from Rajkot city and Surat, 2 each from Junagadh and Valsad, and 1 each from Gir Somnath, Kheda, Morbi, Navsari and Surendranagar. From 20 at the beginning of November, the number of districts with zero active cases got reduced to 12. With discharge of 21 patients, the state added 19 active cases, taking the total to 234, the highest active cases in the past three months. With 62 active cases, Ahmedabad surpassed Vadodara (54) and Valsad (32). The state recorded vaccination of 4.57 lakh persons, taking the total to 7.33 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/first-society-contained-in-6-months/articleshow/87654341.cms||---

It took several rounds of questioning for investigators to discover the hiding place. The chain was finally retrieved from the groove above the compartment's door after Western Railways helped the cops track down the location of the coach. The accused, Dipesh Surve, 29, is a history sheeter. The theft was reported at Dadar station on the eve of Diwali on November 3. Shrikant Shirgavkar, a 47-year-old passenger, was trying to board a Goregaon bound slow local from platform no. 1 around 6pm. He suddenly felt someone tug at his gold chain. Shirgavkar got off the coach and raised an alarm. A team of policemen and women patrolling the platform heard him and started to chase the accused (Surve). To escape from the cops, Surve got into a coach and went to the opposite door but could not find a way to hop out. He then held on to the roof by sliding his fingers into a groove above the door. "Surve was walking away when he suddenly realised that he had found a perfect hiding place for the chain. He went back to the door and slid the chain into the groove. His plan was to retrieve the chain after his release from the police station," said investigating officer Nandkishore Jadhav. The police team caught hold of Surve soon after and took him to the Mumbai Central GRP chowky. But he told him he had dropped the chain during the chase. The cops did not buy his story and quizzed him for two days, trying every trick in the book from threatening him with serious charges to appealing to the goodness in him. "We told him that he had stolen someone's gold around Diwali and ruined the festival for that family," a police officer said. Eventually, Surve caved in and revealed the chain's hiding place. The next challenge was tracking down the coach. Cops viewed CCTV footage of the theft and checked the train concerned. But it turned out that they had got the wrong coach. The cops then took help from Western Railways and tracked the coach with the gold chain to the Kandivali carshed. On November 6, a police team escorted Surve to the carshed and put up ladders to reach the rooftop. They checked every inch of the groove before the chain worth Rs 40000 could finally be recovered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-snatcher-hides-stolen-gold-chain-in-train-roof-groove/articleshow/87655951.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Ahmedabad||Access to civic facilities only if you’re fully vaccinated||AHMEDABAD: It is the holidays, and if you plan to spend some of your free time at the Sabarmati riverfront, Kankaria lakefront or the zoo, be sure you have taken both the shots and are carrying your vaccine certificate to gain entry. As the Covid curve rises in the city once again, the civic body has once again banned those who have not been vaccinated from using public facilities, like civic transport service and from entering public spaces. However, unlike the last time, the rule, which comes into effect from Friday, also restricts access to those who have taken only the first dose of Covid vaccine. Earlier in September, AMC had announced that only those who had got at least one dose of vaccine will be able to avail of various municipal services. Ahmedabad was the first among cities in India to make vaccination mandatory to access civic body-run facilities, services and buildings. “AMC has decided against allowing people who are not fully vaccinated in AMC-run facilities such as city civic centres, AMC buildings, gyms, sports complexes, swimming pools and even aboard AMTS and BRTS buses. This rule will come into effect from Friday,” said AMC’s standing committee chairman Hitesh Barot. He said that vaccine certificates shall be checked at entry point of such facilities. “People who want access to these facilities will have to show Covid vaccination certificate (physical or digital) of both the doses,” an AMC health department official said. The civic body officials said that the move is to give impetus to the ongoing drive to fully vaccinate the city's population. The officer said that the civic body has set up a number of vaccination booths at AMTS, BRTS stands, at civic centres, community centres, at shopping malls and hospitals. AMC to increase Covid testing Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation will also increase Covid testing activity as positive cases are showing a rise after the festive season. “We have decided to increase testing activity at various entry points in the city as the cases are on the rise. If needed we will set up testing domes at state transport bus stands, railway stations and, if needed, at road entry points,” said a senior AMC. The officer said that currently the civic body is carrying out around 2,000 testing every day in the city which will be doubled if needed. AMC standing committee chairman Hitesh Barot said that the civic body is currently surveying people who have tested Covid positive. “The civic body has started tracing contact history of people who have tested positive. We are surveying and if needed we will set up testing domes at every entry point,” Barot said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/access-to-civic-facilities-only-if-youre-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/87654343.cms||---

The renovated lake was formally inaugurated on February 20 last year. After its formal inauguration, the facilities developed around the lake were not open for public use in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. A raging second wave of the pandemic had hit the city soon after the inauguration. Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) standing committee chairman Dr Hitendra Patel said that the borders of the lake have steps and benches where people can spend time. Patel said the lake was renovated at the cost of Rs 34 crore. “We could not allow people in it in the wake of Covid-19. Now, it will remain open from 6am to 8am and 5pm to 8pm. The decision was taken as Covid-19 cases have come down,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/sursagar-opened-for-public/articleshow/87654022.cms||---
---||Chennai||TN: Weightage for internal marks in engineering up from 20% to 40%||CHENNAI: For students of affiliated colleges of Anna University stuttering at 60% overall fail rate, here is some good news. The university’s new regulation for 2021 has doubled the internal assessment weightage for awarding marks from 20% to 40%. The cumulative grade point average (CGPA) for getting first class has also been brought down from 7 CGPA to 6.5 CGPA. Just 25% of engineering students cleared all the subjects in the first semester in January 2019, shows data. The new regulation also allows students to take a study break for up to a year for job or entrepreneurship and has scrapped a 2017 rule that mandated students to compulsorily complete arrears in four attempts. Students can also do up to two online courses in a semester against one course under current rule. “Earlier, study break was allowed only on medical grounds,” an official said. The new changes were part of the university’s plan to impart uniformity in engineering education offered at affiliated colleges, autonomous colleges, and university departments. While affiliated colleges follow an 80%:20% weightage system for end-semester exams and internal tests, autonomous colleges and university departments follow 60%:40% and 50%: 50% weightage system. As per the new regulation, theory courses with laboratory components will have 50%:50% weightage for end-semester exams and internal assessment. For laboratory courses, it will be 60% weightage for internal assessment in end-semester exams. The number of internal assessments has also been brought down from three to two per semester. “There will be two internal assessments in each semester and each assessment will be conducted for 100 marks. An individual assignment or case study or seminar or mini project will carry 40 marks while a written test will be conducted for 60 marks. The candidate’s score for 200 marks will be converted to 40 marks,” the regulations said. End-semester exams will be conducted for 100 marks and the score will be converted into 60 marks. Anna University vice-chancellor R Velraj said, “The university wanted to bring uniformity among all engineering colleges. The new regulations will give more flexibility to students.” As per the earlier regulation, students must complete arrears in four attempts, else they may have to redo the course in fifth semester. “Engineering colleges said students with arrears were discontinuing courses and joining deemed universities. So, the regulation was dropped,” V-C said. The university has also allowed students to appear for arrear exams in subsequent semesters. As per the existing rule, a student can clear arrears from an odd semester only in the next odd semester when the course is offered again. “If a student couldn’t clear in three attempts, then the minimum 50% marks in end-semester exam alone can be declared pass,” the new regulations said. P Deiva Sundari, principal, KCG College of Technology, said, “The increase in weightage for internal assessment including assignment and case studies, mini projects will help students to get more active learning. It has given more space for outcome-based education.” “Pass mark for end-semester exam has been retained at 45 to ensure that there is no dilution of standards in evaluating students,” she added. The university also introduced a new grade “C”. “Students who clear the exam with 50 marks will get C grade,” an official from the university said. The university has also included science club, literary club and fine arts club apart from NCC and NSS to inculcate scientific temper among students. “All colleges are encouraged to start these clubs. Students are encouraged to participate in any of these clubs as part of extra-curricular activities,” the official added. The new regulations also introduce project work in the pre-final semester for engineering students. Some professors, however, said the university needs to evolve a proper mechanism to monitor affiliated colleges to see that they award marks in internal assessment based on impartial evaluation. “If we apply relative grading for thousands of students in a subject, it won’t make much of a difference,” B Chidambararajan, principal, SRM Valliammai Engineering College, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/weightage-for-internal-marks-in-engineering-up-from-20-to-40/articleshow/87655019.cms||A Ragu Raman

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: MBBS student stabbed to death at Yavatmal GMC||YAVATMAL: A MBBS final year student of Vasantrao Naik Government Medical College (GMC) was stabbed to death on Wednesday night on the college campus. The murder triggered a protest by students who demanded immediate arrest of the assailants and resignation of dean Dr Milind Kamble. Dr Kamble said the hospital lodged an FIR against the unidentified assailants on Wednesday night. Police arrested two suspects on Wednesday midnight and their interrogation is in progress, said SP Dilip Patil-Bhujbal. On Thursday, the two suspects were granted PCR till November 15 after they were produced in court. Sources said the unidentified assailants intercepted the deceased, identified as Ashok Pal, a resident of Thane, on the road leading to the new boys hostel when he was returning from the college library around 8.30pm. Fellow students and passers-by spotted Pal lying in a pool of blood and rushed him to the hospital. Some of the students said there was a quarrel between them and some outsiders in August. The dean did not rule out an act of revenge behind the murder. Pal suffered deep wounds inflicted by sharp weapons. The post mortem was conducted in the hospital and the uncle of the deceased claimed the body which was taken to his native place Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh on Thursday. Students staying in the hostels reached the hospital after learning about the murder on Wednesday night and started shouting slogans against the college administration and the police. They also launched an indefinite strike at the main gate. SP Bhujbal, additional SP Khanderao Dharne, city police station officer Nandkishilor Pant, Awadootwadi PSO Manoj Khandare, LCB chief Pradeep Pardeshi and a police team rushed to the college. The SP and collector Amol Yedge, who also visited the college, assured the students of immediate arrests in the case and appealed to them to maintain peace. Dean Dr Kamble said he is ready to step down from the post if it would help solve the issue. He has sent his resignation letter to the director of medical education and research. The collector said that all measures will be taken to prevent such incidents in future. “The administration would send a proposal to the state government to grant adequate compensation to the next of the kin of the deceased medico,” he said. Students said life of a brilliant student was lost due to lapses of the college administration. They alleged that there are no CCTV cameras and street lights on the campus roads. The college administration was apprised of the situation on many occasions but it turned a blind eye, they said. They also claimed there is no adequate security arrangements in the college. The OPD was closed on Thursday due to the strike. Patients coming from far off places faced hardship as the main gates were closed. After a quarrel between the students and outsiders in August, the city police had registered an FIR against both sides. The issue was amicably settled after councillor Nitin Mirzapure intervened. The students and the outsiders moved a joint application before the police saying that they have settled the issue and didn’t want to go ahead with the FIR. Dean Dr Kamble said, “This might be the reason behind the murder. But the victim was a calm person.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mbbs-student-stabbed-to-death-at-yavatmal-gmc/articleshow/87655027.cms||---

Later, he participated in ‘Gopashtami’ festival at Gendikhata, inaugurated Krishi Mela at Manubas village in Jwalapur assembly constituency and then laid the foundation stone of a residential project at SIDCUL. Speaking at the university, the CM referred to PM Narendra Modi's statement during his visit to Kedarnath on November 4. "The PM said that the next decade belongs to Uttarakhand. In the decade, the state will witness fast development in all fields and will eventually become India's number one state," he said. He added that the "PM visualised Kedarnath Dham as no one else had ever done. He was keen that the idea was translated into action". Once the projects, including cable cars for Hemkund Sahib as well as Kedarnath, get executed, the number of pilgrims visiting the famous shrines in Garhwal region will rise significantly," he hoped. University vice-chancellor Devi Prasad Tripathhi thanked the CM him for agreeing to expedite the payment of salary arrears to teachers in the university. Ranipur (Haridwar) MLA Adesh Chauhan, who raised the issue before the CM, said the teachers, as also the vice-chancellor, had been given a hike in their salaries as per the Seventh Pay Commission, but their arrears had not yet been paid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/dhami-inaugurates-sanskrit-varsitys-building/articleshow/87654313.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal
---||Lucknow||Bringing healthcare to people through sub centres for care||The Covid-19 pandemic has been successful in drawing attention to the larger issue of greater investment in the health sector. The government of India has recently launched a very ambitious centrally sponsored Health Infrastructure Mission for the same. This has shown that providing care to people close to their homes is an important issue to address different issues of healthcare, including epidemics. There are three hallmarks of a good healthcare system: accessibility, affordability and quality of care. We have seen in various parts of the country during the pandemic that early intervention and early medication proved to be life saving. This brings focus on the issue of accessibility of healthcare facilities, which is the foremost requirement for people. Only when a person is able to reach a facility does the question of affordability and quality arise. Since everyone does not own a transport and these facilities are not readily available in rural areas, the centre for primary healthcare must be close to home for people. Primary healthcare is provided by the primary health centres and sub health centres, which are gradually getting converted into health and wellness centres. A sub health centre remains the first port of call in rural areas. The norm is to have one sub centre for every 5,000 people in the plains and for every 3,000 in hilly and tribal areas. So, if a district has a rural population of 15 lakh in the plains, it should have 300 sub centres, uniformly distributed, in the district. Here comes the catch. Even if that particular district has 300 sub centres, it would not automatically ensure that every pocket of the district has good accessibility. This is because of faulty planning process. When we treat a district as the unit for planning, the healthcare facilities are located within the district but the distribution, more often than not, gets skewed. Further, these sub centres may not be constructed at the most appropriate location. This happens because a healthcare facility is treated as ‘social infrastructure’ for which land must come free of cost. We can spend Rs 30 lakh for constructing a health and wellness centre in a village but cannot spend Rs 3-4 lakh for procuring a suitable piece of land. This is not the case for roads, bridges, power stations or irrigation canals which are supposed to be ‘real infrastructure’. After constructing a sub centre on a free plot of land 2km from village habitation, we expect the auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) to stay there all alone. This is the reason why at many places, sub centres function sub-optimally and ANMs do not reside there. The answer to addressing the issue of accessibility is no rocket science and can be handled with some re-imagination. Firstly, we can decide that every gram panchayat will have at least one health sub centre. This will address the issue of equitable distribution of sub centres. In fact, we in UP are trying to address the issue of prior skewed distribution through scientific placement of 5,000 new sub centres. Secondly, since grant from the 15th Finance Commission is going to fund the construction of rural healthcare infrastructure, it makes sense to locate a facility in every gram panchayat. When under Right to Education, we appoint one teacher for every 25 students, is it too much to ask for one or two healthcare workers for the entire population of a gram panchayat? Thirdly, we must liberalize the norm and obtain/procure an appropriate piece of land, close to the village habitation, for health sub centres where the ANM can stay safely. This can be done by finding suitable government land or getting a suitable piece through exchange of land or even purchasing. Finally, since primary healthcare takes off the load from secondary and tertiary facilities; hence investing in this strategically would prove to be a game-changer for the healthcare scenario and would create space for augmenting quality of care. This would not only help us in normal times and epidemics/pandemic but would also take us towards universal health coverage.

And had the government not recently raised domestic fare bands by 12.5% some months back, there “won’t have been any airline left for us to board”, Union aviation minister Jyotiraditya M Scindia said at the Times Now Summit 2021 on Thursday. “We are seeing tremendous amount of green shoots. The last weekend saw a high of 3.8 lakh passengers daily, with the pre-Covid high being 4.2 lakh. So we are only 10% below the pre-Covid high. Almost 90% of (domestic) traffic has recovered. But it is important to be cautious,” he said. He said Air India will be transferred to its new owner, the Tata Group, by the third week of January 2022. The country will next year also see a startup, Akasa, take to the skies along with a reborn Jet Airways. TOI had last week reported that January 23 is the “long stop date” by which Tatas have to take over the airline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tatas-will-take-over-air-india-by-the-3rd-week-of-january-union-aviation-minister-jyotiraditya-m-scindia/articleshow/87656477.cms||---

ATS teams arrested Sameer Mandal from West Bengal and Vikram Singh of Punjab from Ghaziabad. ATS officials recovered Indian passports of various names and addresses, Aadhaar and PAN cards, international Covid-19 stamped proformas, certificates, election voter ID cards, stamps, and passports from the possession of Vikram Singh and Sameer Mandal. Mandal runs foodgrain transport business that is spread to Bangladesh and had started tour and travel trade also and started facilitating illegal entry of Bangladeshis and Rohingyas into India. An ATS official privy to the probe said, “The gang had sent scores of Bangladeshi nationals and Rohingyas to Middle east, South Africa, Congo and other countries on Hindu identities and Indian passports.” Later, the accused blackmailed them and extract money by threatening to leak their real identities to authorities, the officer said. Inspector general, ATS, Gajendra Kumar Goswamy, said, “Sameer Mandal and Vikram Singh were arrested after their names were revealed by Mithun Mandal of Bengal, Shaon Ahmed, Mominur Islam and Mehndi Hasan, all of Bangladesh, who were nabbed on October 26.” “During questioning, Sameer revealed that one Saeed of Bangladesh who has fraudulently obtained the citizenship of South Africa, sent Bangladeshis to him. Saeed sent details on WhatsApp whenever a Bangladeshi crossed the border. Sameer took them to the house of his brother Subhash Mandal and got their fake Aadhaar card, PAN card, voter ID card and passport made by one Ratan Mandal,” said Goswamy. Another man in Bangladesh identified as Jehangir used to get Bangladeshis enter India illegally and sent them to Sameer for preparing their fake documents, the IG added. “Vikram Singh came in touch with one Gurpreet Singh, who lives in London and works in the passport office there, through social media and he also helped in making fake passports. About seven months ago, Vikram met Ratan Mandal through social media,” Goswamy said. “The gang also roped in others who helped the Bangladeshis and Rohingyas board flights without proper verification of documents. These people will also be identified, and action will be taken against them,” he added. The addresses mentioned in the passports were verified by police officers of respective states and were found to be fake. The RT-PCR test report and Covid vaccination report to travel abroad were also found to be fake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/2-held-for-trafficking-bangladeshi-citizens/articleshow/87655568.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Soon, faceless procedure for international driving permits||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat government will soon implement a faceless process for issuing international driving permits. This change has been implemented by the central government and will be put in place in the state after the Diwali break.  Officials of the Regional Transport Office (RTO) revealed the road transport ministry has already issued instructions, but the Gujarat transport department is giving final touches to its guidelines. Asking not to be named officials said that they have one request, for renewal of the international permit of a person in Europe, who has been stuck due to the lockdown in 2020 and recently sent a relative to the Ahmedabad RTO to renew his international driving permit. As the person was not present, his permit was not renewed, and permission was sought from higher up for the renewal. An officer said that the new system is at the trial stage and will be implemented soon after the Diwali break. The official said that using the new system, people will be able to apply online from anywhere. The applicant will have to log into the system using his Indian mobile number and authenticate it with a one-time password. The official said applicants will have to provide passport and visa details and permits will then be issued. For renewals, the same mobile number will have to be used for authentication. A senior officer said the department plans to set the fees for renewal or issue of international permit at about Rs 2,500. Officials said the RTO department will have the responsibility of sending the permit to wherever the applicant is overseas. Officials said the RTO concerned will have to make a decision on issuing the permit within 24 hours of the application. The officer said that in no case will the applicant be called to the RTO for any clarification. International driving permits are issued to applicants who hold a permanent licence. The applicant will also have to specify the countries to be visited and the duration of their stay among other details necessary for the issuance of the document.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/soon-faceless-procedure-for-international-driving-permits/articleshow/87654356.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

A video is being circulated of their former finance minister (Sudhir Mungantiwar) who had categorically denied their inclusion that time. Indeed, their salaries are on lower side and need to be hiked. However, the state was undergoing through precarious financial position since last two years due to Covid pandemic and it is not possible to accommodate 1.10 lakh staffers now.”Blaming the BJP for holding common citizens to ransom, Wadettiwar said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, despite suffering from health problems, had discussed this crucial issue during the cabinet meeting and requested the protestors to call off their strike. “The opposition is destroying the ST employees for their political gains in times of pandemic. The government however wants an amicable either through the Bombay High Court or direct talks.”On Naxalite letter to him, the minister said he had already forwarded it to the Home Department. “I have not gone at the tribals protests at Etapalli, as I was requested by the Gadchiroli SP and other officers to remain at home citing security concerns,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-instigating-st-staff-holding-public-to-ransom-wadettiwar/articleshow/87654331.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The tigress, whose body was discovered on Thursday morning, has been identified as part of the litter of popular tigress Madhu of Tadoba buffer zone.Forest officials suspect a farm labourer laid electrified wire along the farm fence to deter wild animals from entering, to protect his crop. Official sources informed that the carcass was discovered in the morning, around 25 meters away from the road on the farm owned by one Randive. RFO, Bhadrawati, Haridas Shende rushed to the spot with his team on getting information and removed the body after necessary inquest formality.Shende confirmed that the tigress had died of electrocution, but they did not recover any wire laid for electrocution. Foresters have detained the farm labourer, who is suspected to have laid the electrified wire. The farm owner lives somewhere else, in a town.Post mortem on the carcass was carried out at Chora forest depot by a team of veterinary doctors comprising Dr Kundam Podchelwar, Dr Ravikant Khobragade and livestock development officer Dr Shendre. “There was a deep scorch mark of electrocution on right hind leg of the animal. The feline is likely to have come through the nullah flowing nearby and fell prey to electrified wire laid through the field,” said the officials, confirming death due to electrocution.State wildlife board member Bandu Dhotre, who was present at the scene, claimed that sub-adult tigers are dispersing from Tadoba through the fields on the fringes of Bhadrawati and Warora range due to their rising population. Recent incidents of tiger falling into farm well in Warora range, attack on farmers on farms in the same range, and this instance of tigress death on a farm strongly suggest that tigers are using surrounding fields to move out.“Farmers try to protect their standing crops by electrifying their farm fences to deter intruding wild herbivores. Hence it is necessary to educate farmers and provide them solar fencing, which is non-lethal,” Dhotre empathized. He underlined the need for immediate implementation of schemes meant for installing solar fences to farmers for protection of their crops as well as wildlife.Sources informed that this is the fifth death of tiger in Chandrapur this year. Maharashtra has witnessed 34 tiger deaths so far and this is the first death due to electrocution this year, sources claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tigress-dies-of-electrocution-in-farm-at-bhadrawati-fifth-death-in-chandrapur-this-year/articleshow/87654326.cms||Mazhar Ali

Civic officials are hopeful of hitting the 100% first shot milestone by Friday. Mumbai has an adult population of 92,36,546 as per estimates from the state government. Till Thursday evening, 92,21,136 (99.8%) had been vaccinated with one dose while 59,14,579 (64%) had taken both shots. In all, 1,51,35,715 doses have been administered in the city since January 16 when the national vaccination drive was kick started. Among corporations, Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation with a population of 11 lakh was the first in the region to achieve 100% with a single shot. Outside of Maharashtra, Bhubaneswar claimed to be the first city to reach the milestone. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said it would be an important milestone in Mumbai’s fight against coronavirus. “We are leading in vaccination across India. Though Mumbai accounts for 10% of the state's population, nearly 15% of doses administered in the state have been in Mumbai,” he said, adding that credit for the feat goes to immunization teams, nurses, hospital heads and all agencies who have participated in the drive over the past 10 months. “We will continue to motivate people at all local levels to get vaccinated since there could be individuals still hesitant to take the vaccine.” The city had started with 10 public vaccination centres. Over the months, the number of centres increased to 461, including 145 private facilities. Nearly 40% of vaccination in Mumbai has been carried out in the private centres. Kakani said vaccination centres may not be scaled down significantly as more than 35lakh people are yet to take their second doses. Also, the vaccination for adolescents is likely to be rolled out from December for which the existing centres may be useful.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-now-city-just-15000-jabs-short-of-100-single-shot-coverage/articleshow/87656683.cms||---

---||Delhi||Premium liquor brands in short supply, Delhiites look elsewhere||NEW DELHI: A shortage of liquor is being reported from different parts of the national capital with less than a week to go for a significant transition in the excise regime in the city. With private liquor vends closed and government vends set to remain open until November 16, Delhiites are forced to visit neighbouring Gurgaon and Noida to buy premium and even sought-after cheaper brands. Even though demand peaks during the festive season, the supply of brands in demand has gone down. As part of Delhi government’s new excise policy, which aims to reform excise rules to increase revenue and provide consumers a much better user experience while buying liquor, the city has been divided into 32 zones and licenses have been allotted on a zonal basis. The transition from the old system to the new saw the private vends closed down from October 1 and only the government vends will remain open till November 17. Sources said that at present, the available stock is being cleared and the vends have not been restocked, leading to the shortage. “There is a shortage of not only premium brands but any brand that sells,” said Vinod Giri, director general of the Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies. “The number of shops is anyway reduced, and the government shops don’t have clarity about what would happen to the stock that remains with them when they shut down,” he said. Giri said that due to the uncertainty over leftover stock, shops had placed conservative orders less than the usual demand. “This is the peak demand time because of the season and they are out of any stock now,” he said, claiming that the scheduling by the excise department has not been appropriately planned with orders taken only till November 3. Giri said that even from November 17, when the new licensees take over, the supply situation may not improve immediately. “In many cases, prices have not been fixed and the supply chain will not kick in immediately. The shortage will not remain only till November 16 but might extend a little. The switch over has not been as smooth as envisaged,” he said. “We are committed to starting the new system from November 17 and we are working at a war footing so that things are much better from next week,” said a Delhi government official. “In any transition, there are some teething troubles, but in the long run, it would be an entirely different kind of consumer experience for Delhiites,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/premium-liquor-brands-in-short-supply-delhiites-look-elsewhere/articleshow/87655577.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Jaipur||Health officials from Centre inspect Rajasthan to contain dengue||JAIPUR: Health officials from the Centre have visited Ajmer, Jodhpur and Jaipur to provide technical support to the local health authorities in containing the spread of dengue. The number of Dengue deaths in the state has touched 33, while the overall tally of dengue cases rose to 13,412 on Wednesday. A senior health department official said the Centre’s team inspected three districts of the state and visited local areas which are at high risk. "In Jaipur, they visited Shastri Nagar and Bani Park areas, where they inspected the houses and suggested that people should keep surroundings clean and keep changing water in containers every seven days. They suggested that breeding of mosquitoes should be prevented in houses," said Dr Narrottam Sharma, chief medical health officer (Jaipur-I). In Jaipur, the health department has set up a control room for dengue (0141-2605858), while for fogging, the Jaipur Municipal Corporation is the responsible government agency. The health department has been appealing to people to conduct anti-larval activities in their houses by cleaning water collected in jars, vases and other containers, where mosquitoes breed since the dengue cases started emerging post-monsoon. The Centre’s teams were tasked to assist and support states to mount an effective public health response. The teams have prepared a report on the status of vector control, availability of kits and medicines, early detection, availability and use of insecticides, the status of anti-larval and anti-adult vector control measures in the state. Since Rajasthan witnessed an increased number of cases reported in October as compared to the number of cases during the same period the previous year, it was among the states where the Centre had sent its teams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/health-officials-from-centre-inspect-state-to-contain-dengue/articleshow/87655039.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat govt clears major hurdles for redevelopment||AHMEDABAD: A major hurdle in the path of redevelopment of old societies registered under the Gujarat Co-operative Act has been removed. A simple office order to all district registrars of co-operatives has been issued by the state to allow redevelopment projects under the amended Act. Though the existing amendment to the Gujarat Ownership Flats Act (1972) was made in September 2018, it was in December 2019 that the urban development department clearly stated that the redevelopment clause also applies to housing societies governed by Gujarat Cooperatives Act. However, since there was no office order from the Co-operatives department, many district registrars were reluctant to accept redevelopment proposals from cooperative housing societies. Meanwhile, major issues are arising out of situations where 25% residents do not agree to redevelopment. Surendra Shah of Vaikunth society in Maninagar says, “In the existing GOF Act, stateneeds to make clear the legal procedures to be followed in cases 25% members of a society do not consent to redevelopment.” Similar issue is being faced by residents of Shri Vivekanand Society in Jodhpur where the developer for past two years is paying transit rent for all 76 members but the project is yet to take off as two members have disagreed. A major potential also lies in many societies constructed by the Gujarat Housing Board. Recently, the state cleared a proposal to convert housing units of the Gujarat Housing Board from leasehold to freehold on payment of a fixed jantri amount. Apart from generating income for the state government, the move will pave the way for residents to own such properties, which they currently hold on lease. Not only will the residents get higher income from sale of these properties, they can also opt for redevelopment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/state-clears-major-hurdles-for-redevelopment/articleshow/87654353.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BJP’s caste cauldron with missing recipe||LUCKNOW: On an upward swing since 2014 Lok Sabha elections and aiming to grab 51% vote share in upcoming polls and of course with a claim of being the largest party nationally, there are grey areas in the BJP that have continued to haunt it since the popularity surge. With assembly elections a few months from now in Uttar Pradesh, the concern is only growing with a few add-on lists. While the caste cauldron of the BJP has several prominent categories out of its recipe mostly because of unavailability, the BJP thinktanks’ dilemma to win over the leftover has still not yielded desired results. Adding to their worries is the fact that a few castes have moved one step towards disenchantment with the party. The main worry haunting the party is its inability to win over the leftover castes, a BJP strategist claimed. Major castes still not in the BJP’s caste bouquet in UP are causing more concern than anything else, he added. Among the major OBCs, the major caste that has remained elusive for the BJP has been Kurmis. Reasons are plenty, a BJP leader said, adding that Kurmis for over two decades had been more loyal to Apna Dal founded by late Sonelal Patel than any other party. It has been so as its founder had made concerted efforts to woo Kurmis who has a sizeable population in UP’s eastern region and some constituencies in Kanpur region. Though there has been no caste-based census, parties claim that Kurmis have seven to eight per cent presence among the OBCs, the most after Yadavs who are believed to have over nine per cent presence among the OBCs. The inability of the BJP to woo Kurmis into the party fold despite the presence of Kurmi leaders like UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and others has forced the party to forge an alliance with Apna Dal-led by late Sonelal Patel’s daughter Anupriya Patel. Barring the numbers, the alliance has favoured Apna Dal more than the BJP itself as even after over six years in power at the Centre and over four-and-a-half-year in power in the state, the Kurmis still have remained elusive for the BJP by and large. Now, the BJP is once again relying on Anupriya Patel’s Apna Dal to win over seats in Vidhan Sabha elections rather than the Kurmis. The BJP had won 312 out of 403 (77.4%) seats in UP assembly polls, increasing its vote share by 25% from the 2012 assembly elections to 39.7% in 2017. The BJP garnered 37.4% of the votes in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The NDA as a whole, received nearly 45% of the vote. Kurmis are not the only worry for the BJP. The list also has Nishads, Rajbhars and Jatavs among Dalits. Even the Rajbhars have remained more loyal to former cabinet minister Om Prakash Rajbhar-led Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party than the BJP despite the BJP leaders, including Amit Shah and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, making major announcements for the community, including the installation of the statue of Hindu warrior Suheldev Rajbhar. Elusive Rajbhars have forced the BJP to forge an alliance with Om Prakash Rajbharled SBSP in 2017 Assembly elections. SBSP got eight seats from BJP’s quota and won four seats and SBSP’s chief Om Prakash Rajbhar getting a cabinet rank in the Yogi Government. However, the honeymoon for the BJP with the SBSP was short-lived as Om Prakash Rajbhar snapped ties. Om Prakash Rajbhar has now announced SBSP’s alliance with the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party. A senior BJP leader was tightlipped when asked if efforts to woo back Rajbhar into BJP as alliance partner had stopped. The SBSP joining hands with SP has made things a little difficult for the BJP especially in the eastern UP, an expert said and added that the alliance would benefit the SP at the cost of the BJP with Akhilesh looking to reap benefits from Yadav-Muslim-Rajbhar combination. The BJP did try to create a leadership of its own by elevating Anil Rajbhar to Cabinet rank, but he has not been able to replace Om Prakash Rajbhar’s clout among the community. Like Rajbhars, Nishad, too, have shown their loyalty towards Dr Sanjay Nishadled NISHAD Party. This has led to the BJP forging an alliance with Dr Sanjay Nishad, but not before giving a Lok Sabha ticket to Dr Sanjay Nishad’s son Pravin Nishad and nominating Dr Sanjay as MLC a month back. Last but not the least, Jatavs among the Dalits have remained loyal to Mayawati-led BSP. Even though the BJP has managed to woo other Dalit castes into its fold in the past three elections, Jatavs continue to show faith in Mayawati. Will they remain loyal in the 2022 polls? Only time will tell.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjps-caste-cauldron-with-missing-recipe/articleshow/87655579.cms||Rajiv Srivastava
---||Jaipur||Disability commissioner’s office raises concern over issues related to PwDs||Jaipur: The office of the commissioner for persons with disability (PwD) has written three letters to the directorate of specially abled persons raising concerns with regard to online issuance of disability certificates, extending government benefits to differently abled pensioners as per BPL norms, and making changes in the guidelines for the scooty scheme. The letters were sent as no action had been taken on these issues by the directorate. The directorate hasn’t replied to any of these letters issued by the commissioner’s office as of now, it added. Petitions in this regard were filed by national vice-president of Divyang Adhikar Mahasangh Hemant Bhai Goyal. The office of the commissioner has directed the directorate of specially-abled persons to take appropriate action in this regard and inform them about it. The petition stated that specially-abled persons were facing a lot of problems in applying for disability certificates online. The office of the commissioner for specially abled persons had issued notices to the directorate of specially abled persons earlier too directing it to make changes in the guidelines for distributing scooty to persons belonging to the category by accommodating other PwD (persons with disability) categories under the scheme. The Divyang Adhikar Mahasangh had raised an objection with the commissioner for specially abled persons with regard to making only persons with locomotor disability eligible for the scheme and leaving out persons with disability (PwD) of other categories. It had also raised an objection with regard to giving benefit under the scheme to employed persons only up to 29 years of age. “There are 21 categories of PwDs (persons with disability) in the state. However, in the guidelines issued by the directorate, they have made only persons with locomotor disability eligible for the scheme. Others like acid attack survivors, persons with autism spectrum disorder, speech and language disability, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, dwarfs, those having hearing loss and others should also be made beneficiaries under the scheme,” said Goyal. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot had announced in the budget for the financial year 2021-22 that college-going students and employed youths under PwD (persons with disability) category will be provided scooty under the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/disability-commissioners-office-raises-concern-over-issues-related-to-pwds/articleshow/87655050.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||MPCB inspection nails pollution at Vimla railway siding||Chandrapur: The inspection by the sub-regional officer of Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) at Vimla Infrastructure (India) Pvt Ltd railway siding at Tadali MIDC here on Thursday revealed several violations of pollution norms.The officer found many facts corroborating the allegation about high pollution caused by the railway siding in the complaint filed by NGO Sanjeewani Paryawarn Samajik Sanstha. The discovery of multiple heaps of suspicious ‘churned coal-like mineral’ at siding has also validated claims of the complainant about mixing of unwanted material into the coal transported from the place.The inspection report states that there are three railway tracks and five platforms of the railway siding, used mainly for transport of coal and iron ore. Currently, four platforms (no. 2, 3, 4 and 5) are in use and a total of 16,000 Metric Tonnes of coal is stocked there. The coal stock comes mostly from WCL (through railway), while outward material is brought by Chaddha Transport, and Sapra Transport. One or two railway rakes of coal are loaded and transported from the siding daily.Inspection reports state that most of the heaps of coal are laid in open and there is no arrangement for dust suppression. The rain guns installed on platform no. 3 and 4 were non-operational. Inspection also revealed that there is a thick layer of dust on approach roads and most of the trucks found there were without tarpaulin to cover the material being transported. Approach roads are dotted with potholes and all the interior roads on siding are kuccha roads, without any fixed water sprinklers along them.The inspection officer collected samples from suspicious stacks of coal like churned material alongside the coal stock on all four platforms used by Maharashtra State Mining Corporation, Nilkanth Transport, Maruti Tradelink, and Rukmai Trading. Inspection also revealed the presence of two suspicious coal stocks in open land near the siding, which railway siding representative claimed does not belong to them. Samples from these stocks have also been collected. The officer found a thick layer of dust on trees, plants and cotton crops in adjoining farmlands. The inspection report highlights heavy fugitive dust emission due to loading and unloading at siding and transportation by trucks. There is no compound wall and no tyre washing system at the siding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mpcb-inspection-nails-pollution-at-vimla-railway-siding/articleshow/87654344.cms||Mazhar Ali

The rally was organised to welcome Yashpal Arya and his son Sanjeev Arya, who recently rejoined Congress after leaving BJP. Addressing the rally, Rawat said, “Despite a clear mandate, the BJP did not fulfill the commitments it made to the people but we will fulfill all our manifesto promises.” The rally was scheduled to be held on Wednesday but owing to a chief minister programme at a nearby location, the event was delayed by a day. The former CM added, “The BJP government has failed on all fronts. Migration from the hills remains a major problem and unemployment has forced youths to move out of state. In addition, anti-people decisions like Char Dham Devasthanam Board and amendment to land purchase laws were made. If voted to office, we will work for the people and take decisions in their interests.” Meanwhile, Rawat's Surendra Kumar slammed the BJP over corruption. “People are still waiting for the appointment of a Lokayukta. The BJP government has tabled the bill in the state assembly but the issue has been on the backburner for over four years. Corruption is at its peak and to avoid any punitive action, the post of ombudsman has been kept vacant,” Kumar said at a press conference.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/will-deliver-on-manifesto-promises-harish-rawat-in-shankhnaad-rally-at-haldwani/articleshow/87654335.cms||Kautilya Singh

They also raised questions why a minister in power needs to engage in an agitation to stop mining.Wadettiwar, speaking to media, said he had to abandon the plan to join the agitation after being requested by the collector and the SP. “I have forwarded the letter issued by the Maoists in my name to the home department,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-shinde-maoists-take-potshots-at-wadettiwar/articleshow/87654342.cms||Soumitra Bose

The SC said the HC, both, a division bench and single-judge bench, cannot be faulted in setting aside the sole arbitrator’s decision. A bench of Justices SK Kaul and MM Sundresh on November 10 dismissed with costs, an appeal filed by Ratnam Iyer—Shroff’s former business associate-- against the HC division bench decision which had also dismissed his appeal against an order of a single Judge bench. Iyer is a resident of Singapore. The SC bench said, “Business associations can sour and that is what has happened in the present case. That the association was across the seas is another aspect.’’ “We find that the arbitrator’s conclusions are not in accordance with the fundamental policy of Indian law, and can thus be set aside…’’ said the SC. The arbitrator had relied on a clause in an agreement between Iyer and Shroff, the consequences of which “are so inappropriate’’ that the award would not stand, the apex court held. – Swati Deshpande||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-5m-arbitral-award-apex-court-relief-for-jackie-shroff/articleshow/87655959.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Gold rates bounce back after Diwali, Dhanteras slump||Nagpur: After a slump during Diwali and also a fall of over Rs450 a tola soon after Dhanteras, gold rates have bounced back on inflation concerns.At Rs49,700 a tola, gold rates are Rs1,500 higher than that in Dhanteras which was on November 2. Silver is also up by Rs2,000 at Rs67,500 a kg in the Nagpur market.The fall was due to apprehensions of a rate hike likely to be announced by the US Fed Reserve. However, the rates were intact. Rising inflation has shifted hedge funds investment to the yellow metal, making gold costly. In India, a weaker rupee has added to the rally. Gold is a dollar-denominated asset. So, if the greenback gets costlier as against the rupee, it makes gold costlier.Ashish Pethe, chairman of Gem and Jewellery Domestic Council, said the rally has affected the demand moderately. “The levels of physical sale are expected to rise against after the rates are stabilized,” he added. Pethe said the rates have gone up due inflation as gold has been a hedge against it.Nitin Khandelwal, former chairman of the council, said last month as much as 90 tons of gold was imported. This was enough to meet the demand. “However, if buying continues as consumers may hope to take advantage of the rally, the yearly imports may touch 1000 tons,” he said.Rakesh Rokde from the Nagpur Sarafa Association said even the Indian demand is expected to have a role in the gold rally. The rally once again led to a hike after Dhanteras.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gold-rates-bounce-back-after-diwali-dhanteras-slump/articleshow/87654364.cms||Shishir Arya

The parikrama, which is organised just after Deepawali, is 45km trek undertaken by pilgrims around the periphery of the twin towns. According to Ayodhya administration, more than 10lakh devotees are expected to take part in the gathering, which will start on Friday and conclude late Saturday. The borders of Faizabad and Ayodhya towns were sealed late Thursday and vehicular entry into the twin towns through highways were banned. If the crowd swells, vehicles coming from Lucknow, Gorakhpur, Azamgarh, Rae Bareli, Sultanpur and Gonda will be diverted at least 100km before the district borders, said a top police officer. The centuries-old ‘Chaudah Kosi Parikrama' ushers the beginning of ‘Kartik Purnima Mela' in Ayodhya and this will be followed by ‘Panch Kosi Parikrama' in which devotees will do a 15km round-trek of the town’s periphery. Talking to TOI, inspector general of police, Ayodhya range, KP Singh, said, “Around 30lakh devotees could participate in both 'parikramas' and the numbers could increase with many devotees arriving to witness construction of the Ram temple. “The district administration has made elaborate arrangements to control traffic and barricades have been erected at over 36 intersections on the 'parikrama' route,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/10l-pilgrims-expected-at-14-kosi-parikrama-in-ayodhya-post-covid/articleshow/87655594.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

The country’s name has not been disclosed considering the security reasons.The factory had been supplying the shells to Indian Army. However, as the requirement now reduced to less than half of the factory’s capacity, YIL now, as an independent PSU, needs to explore other in business opportunities for sustaining itself.YIL, or the old Ambajhari factory, makes products like empty shells of rockets and shells for the artillery and armoured weapon systems. “There are plans to export the shells of this caliber to different middle eastern as well other countries,” said sources. The empty shells were filled with ammunition at the erstwhile ordnance factory Chanda. The factory now comes under a different PSU,-- Munitions India Limited (MIL). The filling will now be done as a commercial transaction by MIL.YIL is also exploring options to sell empty shell in foreign markets too.“YIL will have to explore other markets as its existing order book from the Army is not very healthy,” said sources. “This is because the requirement keeps varying leading to major dips in orders from time to time. At present, the company’s expenses exceed the income from orders for the current year,” sources added.YIL has been formed by clubbing seven ordnance factories and is headquartered at Nagpur.The factory however also needs support from the government so that it can sustain in the long run. If the losses are mount than as a PSU it may be difficult to sustain due. This can lead to the state of art machinery assets under the company going waste, said sources.The import orders would take finalize in the longer term of 2-3 years till then the new company needs to be supported.The YIL is also exploring the scope of manufacturing railway axles as the existing set up also can be used for the purpose. This is part of the mandate after corporatization.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/yil-eyes-deal-to-help-middle-east-country-set-up-howitzer-shell-factory/articleshow/87654349.cms||Shishir Arya

A civic official said the IVR services of BSNL may be used to reach out to them. The civic body has already downloaded names and handed them over to ward war rooms. The sheer numbers could mean the teams would take a while to reach everyone. "Through IVR, people will get calls and they simply have to press 1 or 2 if they have been vaccinated with the first or both doses. The automated system can reach 4-5lakh in a matter of a few days. The ward war room efforts will continue too," the official said. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said there are four possible groups: those who have taken a second shot under a different number, those who took a first shot in Mumbai and the second elsewhere, numbers that are not reachable, and finally, people willing but haven’t had time to take it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ivr-system-to-reach-out-to-4-73-lakh-due-for-a-2nd-shot/articleshow/87655590.cms||---

On Thursday, she met a delegation of ASHA workers who were allegedly beaten up by the Shahjahanpur police when they tried to meet UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday. Thereafter she accused the BJP government of disrespecting the ASHA workers. Political analysts saw the move as another bid to consolidate and woo women voters in UP. Priyanka also promised to pay Rs 10,000 as honorarium to them if voted to power. As of now, ASHA workers are paid a small incentive per activity. The incentives add up to about Rs 3,500-Rs 3,700 at the end of each month. ASHA workers have been demanding revision of their incentive and permanency of jobs for long. In all, there are over two lakh ASHA workers in UP. After meeting the delegation, Priyanka accused the UP government of ‘insulting’ the work done by Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA). "Every assault on the ASHA sisters by the UP government is an insult to the work done by them. My ASHA sisters have given their services diligently in coronavirus pandemic times and on other occasions. A decent Honorarium is their right. It is the duty of the government to listen to them,” she said in a tweet after her meeting. Adding that ASHAs deserved respect and the Congress will fight for them, Priyanka said: “The Congress party is committed to the rights of honorarium of Asha sisters and their respect and if the government is formed, Asha sisters and Anganwadi workers will be given an honorarium of Rs 10,000 per month.” Earlier, Priyanka lent her voice to the contractual staff posted in UP secretariat allegedly harassed by a senior officer on her workplace. Though an FIR under relevant sections of law was lodged against the officer accused by the UP police, Priyanka took to social media to question the safety of women at work place or anywhere else.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/priyanka-promises-rs-10k-honorarium-to-asha-workers/articleshow/87655606.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Mangaluru||Covid aftermath: No fees, poor admissions push 14 schools in DK to shut down||Mangaluru: The Covid-induced financial crunch and the near lack of school admissions have forced 14 schools in Dakshina Kannada to shut their operations. Of the 14, one is a government school, four are aided schools and nine are unaided or private institutions. All have written to the department of public instruction (DPI), seeking to shut their doors. The only government school shutting down is doing so for lack of fresh admission. The school is in Kilenjur, under the Mangaluru North Block Education Office (BEO) limits. The lower primary school had two children, who were siblings. They completed their studies and there are no new admissions this academic year. In the same BEO limits, two aided schools and an unaided one have sent proposals for closure. In the Mangaluru South BEO limits, two unaided schools and an aided one are expected to close their doors too. In the Moodbidri BEO limits, one aided and one unaided school, and in the Bantwal BEO limits, two unaided schools have sought closure. There are two unaided schools closed in the Puttur BEO limits and one unaided in the Sullia limits, said Manjula KL, the deputy project coordinator of the Samagra Shiksha Karnataka, Dakshina Kannada. The major reason for the closure of the unaided schools is the non-payment of fees. This has resulted in a financial crisis for them. Poor admissions and management of the institutions are also factors that led the schools to decide to shut down. “We cater to children from low-income groups. As a result of the pandemic, their parents have not paid us the proper fees. We cannot pay our staff and look after the buildings’ maintenance. We cannot sustain ourselves any longer after the economic blow and decided to shut down. The institution may open next year,” said an institution head. A DPI official said: “The head of a private school in Moodbidri has gone incommunicado and all staff have been laid off. Meanwhile, all the students have been given transfer certificates without citing any reason for the school’s closure. We have asked them to clarify,” said the official. DDPI Malleswamy shared that the closure of some schools is temporary. “They may open in the next academic year,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/covid-aftermath-no-fees-poor-admissions-push-14-schools-in-dk-to-shut-down/articleshow/87653579.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

Sand mining from river beds has been allowed after almost four years and lease holders are expected to start operations over the next three months after getting environmental clearance (EC) from the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC). Additional chief secretary, mines and petroleum, Subodh Agarwal said, “With our chief minister's efforts, the long-pending issue of illegal bajri mining has been resolved in the state. This will benefit the public at large. At present, there are three large leases operational and five more are expected to start operations soon. More companies will start work as soon they receive EC.” The CEC, constituted by the apex court to look into the issue of illegal sand mining on December 23, 2020, had submitted its report after carrying out a physical inspection. “The recommendations made by the CEC, except recommendation ‘J’, are approved for implementation forthwith,” the court order says. An official with the mining department said the ‘J’ recommendation referred to levying a penalty of Rs 10 lakh per vehicle and Rs 5 lakh per cubic metre of sand seized. The CEC has recommended the MoEFCC to issue EC to all valid letter of intent (LoI) holders recommended by the expert appraisal committee (EAC) within a period of three months and without insisting on the submission of the scientific replenishment report as a pre-condition. The replenishment study will be undertaken during the course of mining. “Out of 82 large leases, the EAC has recommended 65. After the SC nod, they will receive EC within 3 months from the MoEFCC,” an official mining department source said. The SC had earlier restrained operations of large mining lease holders who did not have EC from the ministry. The ministry had later laid a condition for companies to carry out a scientific replenishment study. In its report, the CEC highlighted the delay in granting EC as the main reason for the widening gap between supply and demand, which resulted in the proliferation of illegal mining activities. Following the order, the state government is likely to earn an estimated revenue of Rs 400 crore per annum. A senior mining department official said, “The 65 large leases can mine an estimated 700 lakh tonne from their operations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/after-4-yrs-sc-nod-for-sandmining-from-river-beds-in-raj/articleshow/87655106.cms||Ajay Singh

At least 83% of people have been administered the first dose and 48.9% people have been administered bot the doses in the state. He said efforts would be made for the 100% vaccination by making a special action plan and increasing the number of vaccination camps in the less vaccinated districts. The health department is focusing on vaccination at the ongoing Prashashan Sheharon and Gaon ke Sang campaigns. People who were deprived of the Covid vaccine would be vaccinated on a largescale through 12,000 camps in Chiranjeevi Health Camps starting from November 14. Till November 10, against the targeted population of the state, more than 6.36 lakh people have been administered the first dose and more than 2.8 crore have been administered both the doses.

We are 800 of us here and our lives are under threat. There is only one security guard here,” said Sagar Dole who heads the MBBS students association in Yavatmal.“Ashok was a sincere, calm and studious person. He was brutally murdered in cold blood. The spot where the incident took place is among the dark areas of the campus. There is no CCTV too,” added Dole.Doctors believe it was a preplanned murder. They told TOI that Pal had some issues with relatives of a patient in August. “If proper security was provided inside the campus, he would have been alive today,” said Dr Saket Mundhada, vice-president of the Central Committee of the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) who also heads MARD at GMCH Yavatmal.MARD has taken up the matter with medical education minister Amit Deshmukh and the DMER chief Dr Dilip Mhaisekar. “Doctors face attacks by angry relatives every day. We demand immediate justice for Ashok and a safe and secure environment in all medical colleges,” said Dr Dnyaneshwar Dhobale, president of Central MARD.The MBBS students and resident doctors locked all gates of the campus and raised slogans. They stopped working for almost entire Thursday. A candle march was taken out on Thursday evening. In-charge dean Dr MB Kamble offered to resign but it has not been accepted by the DMER yet.That Deshmukh had not reacted till late on Thursday has disheartened the doctors. “Justice delayed is justice denied,” said one of the agitating doctors while speaking to TOI. The GMCs across the state are likely to intensify the agitation on Friday.Sena neta threatens agitating doctorsLate on Thursday, the central committee of MARD released video footage of Yavatmal’s Shiv Sena neta Santosh Dhawale threatening them. He can be heard saying, “Will you leave the place or shall I call my men.”“How can a student feel secure in a college campus when a politician threatens us in front of the collector and superintendent of police?” the tweet addressed to CM Uddhav Thackeray, deputy CM Ajit Pawar and home minister Dilip Walse Patil reads. Dhawale had contested the MLA elections twice and lost. He became popular by helping poor patients at the GMCH.

Sumit Matoo posted a picture on social media of his grandmother, Jagat Rani Koul, on the trolley on Wednesday. Tagging the airline, IndiGo, Matoo wrote that his grandmother had to wait for over an hour before being taken inside on the trolley, and that the airline said it had only three wheelchairs for passengers flying out. Speaking to TOI on Thursday, Matoo said his relatives were travelling from Pune to Delhi and then to Jammu. “What happened was embarrassing and insulting. We had booked the tickets two months in advance and opted for wheelchair assistance for my grandmother as she is old and cannot walk,” he said. The flight was set to take off at 1.20pm and Matoo’s family reached the airport around 11am. “At the IndiGo counter, my relatives asked for a wheelchair and were told to wait for 15 minutes. This stretched for nearly an hour,” he said. With about an hour to go, the family found that no one at the IndiGo counter could give any satisfactory answers regarding the wheelchair. “An airline staffer said that if my grandmother could walk, she should. Ultimately, my relatives had no option but to get her to sit over some luggage on the baggage trolley and wheeled her till the departure gate. There, a CISF officer arranged for a wheelchair,” he said. Gueries were sent via messages to IndiGo on Wednesday evening and Thursday, but there was no response at the time of filing this report. An airline representative, however, replied to Matoo on social media. “We understand one of our managers was in touch and able to resolve the matter. We are extremely sensitive towards the needs of our passengers in need of special assistance. This has been highlighted to all teams to ensure non-occurrence,” the message stated. Pune airport director Santosh Dhoke said providing wheelchairs was the responsibility of airlines. “I don’t have information about the incident. We have a helpdesk which can be contacted too. They could have also contacted the terminal manager,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/booked-wheelchair-missing-85-yr-old-flyer-brought-into-pune-airport-on-baggage-trolley/articleshow/87655076.cms||Joy Sengupta

He assured that workers wanting to resume will be provided security by the government. On the other hand, many commuters who depended on the alternate private transport complained of ‘shortage of vehicles’ and ‘overcharging’ across the state.As many as 1,135 more workers were suspended in MSRTC on Thursday, including 64 from Mumbai depots and 73 from Thane, for joining the strike. With this, the total number of staffers suspended so far has risen to 2,053. Speaking to the media, Parab said that the workers were being hindered by “political parties, including the BJP”. While BJP had supported the workers in morchas, sit-in protests and rallies on Wednesday, a delegation of ST workers got support from MNS leader Raj Thackeray, who heard their grievances at his residence in Dadar on Thursday morning. “The issues facing workers are never resolved through political agitations,” Parab said. He warned that those who obstruct employees from returning to work will be dealt with sternly. The strike inconvenienced lakhs of commuters across Maharashtra, many of whom had to pay more for the private transport. They complained of overcharging by few private buses and other vehicles across the state. More than 2,000 private buses operated across the state, besides several private cabs, autos and other vehicles. Shivneri AC buses which are popular on Mumbai-Pune route and charge Rs 525 per seat were off roads. In comparison, some of the private bus operators charged Rs 800 upwards for a trip to Pune. In Satara, private buses were running full and many passengers were stranded on Thursday night. “Even milk vans were in demand as they picked up passengers,” said a Mumbai resident who wanted to travel from Satara. In a few districts, passengers told the media that private bus fares were almost double the normal MSRTC fare. As per rules, the government can take action against operators as they are allowed to hike fares only 1.5 times the MSRTC fare, officials added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-govt-promises-to-protect-msrtc-staffers-willing-to-return-another-1135-suspended/articleshow/87655971.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

Sources said that the UT administration requested the President’s office for inauguration of the Chandigarh Bird Park, but has not received confirmation till date. They added that if the bird park inauguration did not figure in the President’s schedule, they would could get it inaugurated by UT administrator Banwari Lal Purohit. Recently, the Central Zoo Authority (CZA), in an RTI reply, clarified that the bird aviary does not fall under the definition of a zoo as per Section 2 (39) of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The ministry of environment, forest and climate change recently gave clearance for the walk-through bird aviary. According to the RTI reply, a CZA team visited the site on August 27 and submitted their recommendations. The recommendations by CZA team read, “Based on the species list provided and data recorded during inspection, all species except Mandarin Duck, are non-native and do not come under the definition of captive animals as per section 2 (5) of the wildlife protection act 1972.” The recommendations further reads, “Therefore the species shall be removed from the collection, as the species is covered under schedule iv of the wildlife protection act 1972……Therefore given the proposed collection, the said facility does not come under the definition of ‘zoo’ as per section 2 (39) of the wildlife protection act, 1972”. In its reply to the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI), UT forest and wildlife department justified and defended the upcoming walk-through aviary at the city forest (Nagar Van) adjoining Sukhna Lake. “None of the rules, guidelines or laws have been violated in the process,” UT’s reply read. UT chief conservator of forests (CCF), Debendra Dalai, in the reply to AWBI said, “The department of forest and wildlife, Chandigarh administration has developed two walk through aviaries at Nagar Van within the city limits to house exotic birds which are commonly bred in India.” It adds, “The procurement of exotic birds was done only from registered, reputed and authentic sellers/breeders/suppliers and not from any grey market. These suppliers are registered with the Animal Welfare Board of Tamil Nadu (AWBT) and also registered on ‘Parivesh’ portal of ministry. Before selecting the sellers, a committee consisting of officers from different departments such as animal husbandry and fisheries, finance department and the forest department cross-verified all the details and sources of birds were also traced physically visiting the facilities on site. These exotic birds are housed for nature education and for all non-commercial usage or public displays”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-plans-to-get-chandigarh-bird-park-inaugurated-by-president/articleshow/87654383.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Jaipur||Bajri prices likely to come down after SC ruling||Edited (294) Jaipur: People of the state can heave a sigh of relief as prices of bajri are expected to come down following the Supreme Court judgment. In recent past, the ban on bajri has not only led to rise in illegal mining of the sand gravel but also increase in prices in the black market. As the sand commanded an exorbitant price in the grey market, people had no option but to buy it at higher rates. Since the ban, the rate of one truck of bajri, which stood at Rs 50,000, has now gone up to Rs 1.25 lakh. People who have started their construction work were forced to buy bajri at high prices that ranges between Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000 per tonne. People who were involved in the trade said, after the judgement, the bajri prices are expected to come down to Rs 1,000 per tonne and it will be a major relief to the residents of the state. All Rajasthan Bajri Truck Operators Welfare Society president Naveen Sharma said, “Consumers were paying exponentially high prices for bajri. Our efforts to bring the prices down to benefit the public has yielded results. This decision will curb the practice of illegal mining and black marketing. The prices will also be reduced.” Now many middle-income groups who had postponed construction of their houses in past are planning to start it again. Ramendra Singh, resident of Chitrakoot, said, “I had cancelled my plan to lay the roof of my house earlier as bajri, which is an essential part for construction was expensive and not available easily. Even buying bajri from black market was a risky affair and I don’t want to take law in my hands. Now after situation is normal will construct my house.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bajri-prices-likely-to-come-down-after-sc-ruling/articleshow/87655087.cms||---
---||Mangaluru||Tibetan duo held for credit card fraud||Mangaluru: Cybercrime sleuths in Mangaluru on Wednesday arrested two Tibetans allegedly for credit card fraud. Mangaluru city police commissioner N Shashi Kumar said that the Cyber Economics and Narcotics (CEN) Crimes wing registered a complaint from CD Alexaner, an Attavar resident, who pointed to the continued use of his State Bank of India (SBI) credit card even after he surrendered the same. In his complaint, lodged in September, Alexander stated that he surrendered his card on March 23 after the bank increased its charges. He subsequently received a one-time password (OTP) on his phone, following which details of his credit card account were collected over the phone by an individual who reportedly spoke to Alexander in Hindi. Four days after surrendering his card, Alexander learnt from statements issued by the bank that his card had been misused, with transactions worth more than Rs 1.1 lakh being billed to its account. An investigation into the crime revealed that Rs 1.12 lakh had been transferred through the MobiKwik digital wallet app to two bank accounts – one each in Maharashtra and in Uttar Pradesh. Money was also transferred to an account of Kanara DCC Bank, registered under the name Lobsang Sangyes, a resident of Lama Camp in the Tibetan Colony in Mundgod in Uttara Kannada district. Cybsercime sleuths from Mangaluru on Wednesday arrested Lobsang, 24, and Dakpa Phunde, 40, from the Shar Gaden monastery in Mundgod. Dakpa has been charged with directing Lobsang to open an account with the Kanara DCC Bank exclusively for such transactions. Dakpa has also been accused of using banned Chinese apps such as WeChat and Red Pack, which the sleuths suspect may have been used for ‘hawala’ transactions. “Local agents were facilitating the transactions between Tibet and Mundgod. Police are examining all the details, using the information retrieved from the two suspects’ phones. We think they earned a commission for the transaction. Since both of them are Tibetans, we have shared the information we have about them with other agencies,” Shashi Kumar said. The city police commissioner admitted to the two of them having been tough nuts to crack. “They refused to divulge any information, and whatever we have was retrieved using technical means, particularly bank statements. We obtained this data from their mobile phones,” Shashi Kumar added. Lobsang and Dakpa, who were produced at a court on Wednesday, were remanded in police custody for ten days, while cybercrime sleuths are on the hunt for a third individual suspected to be involved in the racket.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/tibetan-duo-held-for-credit-card-fraud/articleshow/87653597.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Haryana: Regulatory commission raps discom chief||CHANDIGARH: The chairman of Haryana discoms — Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited (DHVNL) and Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited (UHBVNL) — has virtually received rap on knuckles from the Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission (HERC) for not complying with the order regarding revision of advance consumption deposit (ACD). The commission has also given the chairman last opportunity to submit its reply on the issue within seven days or face penal action. ACD is an amount deposited to the companies by the consumers as a security to cover the consumption charges. “Had revision of ACD of individual consumers, as specified in the regulations in vogue since 2005, been carried out, every year, the issue of hardship to consumers, after the onset of Covid-19, would not have arisen at all. Hence the chairman was directed to investigate and submit his report to the commission… In view of the above, the commission reiterates its directions as issued in its order dated September 1. As a last opportunity the requisite report, be filed by the discoms’ chairman within seven days from the date of this order, failing which the commission shall be constrained to initiate action as per the Electricity Act, 2003,” the HERC, headed by its chairman R K Pachnanda has ordered. The commission also observed that it is the statutory duty of the distribution companies to comply with the commission’s directions “meticulously and in letter and spirit”. “However, the licensees have tried to circumvent the commission order by filing a report, with the approval of the additional chief secretary (ACS) for power instead of filing the investigation report of discoms chairman for not revising the ACD,” the commission observed further. In its earlier order dated September 1, the commission had directed the DHBVNL and UHBVNL chairman to investigate as to why revision of ACD of individual consumers has not been carried out since 2005. The commission had passed these orders while taking suo motu cognizance of the issue while hearing a petition for waiver of revision of ACD for the financial year 2019-20 and 2020-21 on the electricity consumers of DHBVN. UHBVN director finance submitted before the commission that there was no role of its chairman in the matter. Director operations submitted that DHBVN, vide letter dated October 13, has submitted a report duly approved by Haryana additional chief secretary (ACS) of power department in compliance of the HERC order dated September 1. On this, the commission observed that it was unfortunate to note the averment of the director finance that the chairman of the licensees had no role in the matter. “Is he trying to imply that the distribution companies’ chairman is symbolic and has abdicated his responsibility and duty? It needs to be noted that in the matter of revision of ACD, there has been a systematic failure in compliance at all levels. Resultantly, the chairman was directed and expected to investigate the matter threadbare and submit a report,” HREC observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/has-discom-chairman-abdicated-duty-asks-regulatory-commission/articleshow/87655088.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Dog carcasses exhumed from 2 spots following court order||Thiruvananthapuram: The cloud of suspicion over death of dogs brought for sterilisation at the ABC centres led to exhumations of the carcass in two different parts of the district on Wednesday. A three-member panel of government veterinary doctors exhumed as many as 10 carcasses from the premises of Animal Birth Control centre at Vandithadam to determine their cause of death. The procedure was done based on an order issued by Judicial First Class Magistrate at Neyyattinkara after admitting a petition in this regard by animal lovers and feeders Aparna Surendran, Geetha and Nisha Vincent. The carcass of a dog was exhumed and samples were sent to the disease investigation lab at Palode from Panayilkadavu in Vakkom after locals raised suspicion over the manner in which two carcasses of dogs were found near a temple pond in the area. The police and the panchayat authorities doused alleged attempts at turning it into a communal issue. Noushad B, a ward member, said that two carcasses of dogs were found near the temple pond in the past one week. “We brought the matter to the police and the carcass was exhumed to find out the actual cause of death,” said Noushad. Meanwhile, the animal lovers in the city who have raised allegations of ill treatment of stray dogs at the Animal Birth Control centre at Vandithadam filed a fresh complaint before the state police chief on Wednesday against the centre for alleged cover up of their atrocities. This was after they realised that the fresh carcass of a dog they had found buried on the centre’s premises two weeks ago has vanished. The petitioners had alleged that stray dogs brought to the ABC centre for sterilization were being ill-treated. Excess number of dogs were kept in small cages. The number of surgeries conducted per day as per the register and the number of strays kept there did not match, pointing to the possibility of strays being illegally culled to save effort. On October 28, they even found the fresh carcass of a dog buried in the centre’s compound. Though they filed a complaint before the local police at Kovalam, the police did not register an FIR. Following this, the complainants approached the court. ‘’The carcass we found belonged to a light brown coloured dog. But, what was exhumed from the same spot today was the carcass of a black dog,” said Aparna Surendran. They believe the carcass was removed to cover up the atrocity which the dog might have faced. Hence they visited the state police chief’s office in person and filed their complaint. One of the doctors in the panel told TOI that all carcasses exhumed were apparently more than three weeks old and were in varying stages of decay. After conducting a procedure to determine the species of the carcasses, samples were collected from their viscera and sent to the chemical examiner’s lab. This is to find out whether the dogs died of poisoning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/dog-carcasses-exhumed-from-2-spots-following-court-order/articleshow/87634569.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Pool cars busy elsewhere, parents fret over commute||Kolkata: Most parents now have to take on the added responsibility of ferrying their Class IX-XII wards from Tuesday when schools reopen since they are unable to get back to the earlier pool car regime because the vehicles are now otherwise engaged. In the past 20 months, when kids have been home, many pool car owners have started services for office-goers, medical staff or have converted the cars into delivery vehicles. Moreover, schools are reopening with only four classes and it is still uncertain when the junior classes will start, making it an unviable proposition to run cars for school duty, pool car owners said. They feared schools might shut again since a large number of parents are not consenting to sending kids to campuses.More than 40% pool cars are engaged in ferrying office-goers who have stopped using public transport for fear of Covid and they pay more than what pool car owners charged parents. “For most pool car owners, it was the only source of livelihood and when parents chose not to pay, we were in dire straits. We didn’t have to buy fuel and were saving on regular maintenance, but EMIs for the vehicles and drivers had to be paid. We were desperate for alternatives and when we have found them, it is difficult to re-convert, especially because ferrying school children has become an uncertain business now,” said Arupam Banerjee, vice-president of West Bengal Pool Car Owners’ Association.Pool car owners, advised by the associations, requested parents to pay at least 25% of the monthly fee and keep the service alive, but most parents did not do so saying they didn’t want to pay for a service they did not use. Pool car owners are now telling parents that even if they make arrangements for their kids, there will be a re-joining charge and a sizeable hike in the charge per child.“Despite years of service, parents pulled out when we were in a tough spot. Naturally, they will have to compensate for that,” said Gourango Sarkar, who runs a car pool service in north Kolkata and the northern fringes.Anurag Agarwal, operator of the city’s largest school bus fleet, said, “Right now, we may have to operate only 200 of my 1,000 buses.” However, bus operators will first observe the situation before taking a decision on fare modification. “When the lockdown began in March 2020, diesel price was Rs 65/L, now it is Rs 90/L. So there should be a proportionate revision,” said an operator.There are some parents who are scared of the sanitisation of pool cars.

The National Achievement Survey (NAS) is to be held on Friday. Over 30,000 students from 950 schools in the MMR are participating in the survey. Students have to report to their respective schools by 8 am. While these students have been permitted to travel by train along with a companion, who does not have to be fully vaccinated, schools where students take state transport buses have to make arrangements to get children to schools. The survey, a written test ranging from 90 to 120 minutes, is for selected class 3, 5, 8 and 10 students. Across India, over 39 lakh students from 733 districts are expected to participate in the survey.

The idol went missing from Varanasi more than a century ago. Union minister for culture and tourism G Kishan Reddy handed over the idol to UP minister Suresh Rana in the presence of Union ministers Smriti Irani and Meenakshi Lekhi. The event was followed by a ‘shobha yatra’ or procession that will conclude at Kashi on November 15, before meandering through the state. On Thursday, it had brief stopovers at Mohan Mandir in Ghaziabad and Dadrinagar Shiva temple in Noida while proceeding to Bulandshahr from where it will go to Aligarh, Hathras and Kasganj, where the yatra will halt for a night. On Friday, the procession will move through Etah, Mainpuri, Kannauj and Kanpur, where again it will halt at night. On Saturday, (November 13), the ‘shobha yatra’ will pass through Unnao, Lucknow and Barabanki before another overnight stay at Ayodhya. The idol will reach Varanasi on November 14 via Sultanpur, Pratapgarh and Jaunpur. The ancient idol will be installed at Kashi Vishwanath temple amid Vedic chants on November 15, which happens to be Devotthan Ekadashi. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the homecoming of the idol from Canada, following an agreement with the Canadian government during a Mann ki Baat session last year. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath recently thanked the PM for his relentless effort to preserve the nation’s cultural legacy. During his recent visit to Lucknow on November 3, Union minister Kishan Reddy had said as many as 42 rare idols and antiquities have been returned to India by different countries during the tenure of Prime Minister Modi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/annapurna-idol-given-to-up-on-statewide-yatra/articleshow/87655617.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Police hope crimes associated with illegal bajri trade will plummet||JAIPUR: On the morning of July 12, 2019, Kishore Singh (60) was mowed down outside his house in Kardhani by a truck carrying smuggled sand. Singh’s grisly murder sent shudders across the city, driving home the enormity of sand mafia’s growing footprint. The illegal ‘bajri’ trade became so brazen that even top cops expressed their helplessness in checking it. With the ban being lifted, police are hoping that the illegal trade may finally subside. Sources informed TOI that ever since the ban was imposed on sand mining, middlemen, transporters and cops forged a deep nexus to profit from the sand crunch. Over 600 cases related to illegal mining were filed in the state even as several cops came under the scanner for having ties with the nexus. According to a police official, vehicles escorting a truck illegally transporting sand earned a profit of up to Rs 3,000 per trip. The price of sand before the ban ranged between Rs 750 and Rs 800 a tonne. The illegally mined sand, however, could cost up to Rs 4,500 a tonne. One police officer informed TOI that in several meetings, the matter was raised but in vain. “The ban was breeding a major corruption in the department. No amount of punitive action could discourage people who were reaping a windfall of several lakhs a month,” the official said on the condition of anonymity, adding that not just police, staff of different departments was also willing to turn a blind eye as they vied for their share of the illicit wealth. With profit margins so high, the sand mafia was willing to take whatever risks necessary to carry on with business. So much so, that despite many measures to rein in the mafia, they brazenly defied the security checkpoints and continued with their illegal trade. “If you look at data carefully, foot soldiers of the mafia were mostly history-sheeters, village strongmen or local louts who joined the bajri smuggling syndicate for quick money,” the official said, adding that many former criminals who had cut their teeth in illegal liquor, readily jumped the ship to escort trucks past the police cordons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cops-heave-sigh-of-relief-as-crimes-associated-with-illegal-bajri-trade-would-go-down/articleshow/87655112.cms||---
---||Dehradun||VC of Soban Singh Jeena Univ to step down after HC order; second such cancellation by court||Almora: After serving as the vice-chancellor (VC) of Soban Singh Jeena University for about a year and three months, Narendra Singh Bhandari is set to step down from the post. On Wednesday, the Uttarakhand high court (HC) cancelled the appointment of Bhandari, who assumed office in August 2020. The decision came as the HC was hearing a petition -- filed by Dehradun resident and activist Ravindra Jugran -- which claimed that Bhandari was not eligible for the post as he doesn’t have 10 years of professorship experience, as mandated by the University Grants Commission (UGC). Jugran, in his petition, said that Bhandari has been a professor for about eight years, following which, he was appointed as a member of the Uttarakhand Public Service Commission. After hearing arguments in the case, the division bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice NS Dhanik cancelled Bhandari’s appointment, stating that it violated clause 7.3.0 of the University Grants Commission. When TOI asked if he will challenge the HC order, Bhandari said, “I am yet to receive the court order.” This is the second time the HC has cancelled the appointment of a sitting state university vice-chancellor on this ground. In 2019, CS Nautiyal’s appointment to the post of Doon University VC was cancelled after the court found that he didn’t have 10 years of teaching experience as a professor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/vc-of-soban-singh-jeena-univ-to-step-down-after-hc-order-second-such-cancellation-by-court/articleshow/87654405.cms||---

---||Jaipur||After 4 yrs, SC nod for sandmining from river beds in Raj||Jaipur: The Supreme Court on Thursday gave sanction to sand mining from river beds in the state and approved recommendations made by the central empowered committee (CEC) constituted to look into the matter. Sand mining from river beds has been allowed after almost four years and lease holders are expected to start operations over the next three months after getting environmental clearance (EC) from the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC). Additional chief secretary, mines and petroleum, Subodh Agarwal said, “With our chief minister's efforts, the long-pending issue of illegal bajri mining has been resolved in the state. This will benefit the public at large. At present, there are three large leases operational and five more are expected to start operations soon. More companies will start work as soon they receive EC.” The CEC, constituted by the apex court to look into the issue of illegal sand mining on December 23, 2020, had submitted its report after carrying out a physical inspection. “The recommendations made by the CEC, except recommendation ‘J’, are approved for implementation forthwith,” the court order says. An official with the mining department said the ‘J’ recommendation referred to levying a penalty of Rs 10 lakh per vehicle and Rs 5 lakh per cubic metre of sand seized. The CEC has recommended the MoEFCC to issue EC to all valid letter of intent (LoI) holders recommended by the expert appraisal committee (EAC) within a period of three months and without insisting on the submission of the scientific replenishment report as a pre-condition. The replenishment study will be undertaken during the course of mining. “Out of 82 large leases, the EAC has recommended 65. After the SC nod, they will receive EC within 3 months from the MoEFCC,” an official mining department source said. The SC had earlier restrained operations of large mining lease holders who did not have EC from the ministry. The ministry had later laid a condition for companies to carry out a scientific replenishment study. In its report, the CEC highlighted the delay in granting EC as the main reason for the widening gap between supply and demand, which resulted in the proliferation of illegal mining activities. Following the order, the state government is likely to earn an estimated revenue of Rs 400 crore per annum. A senior mining department official said, “The 65 large leases can mine an estimated 700 lakh tonne from their operations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/after-4-yrs-sc-nod-for-sandmining-from-river-beds-in-raj/articleshow/87655141.cms||Ajay Singh

Public prosecutor Shekar Shetty said that Theresa D’Souza, the retired teacher, gave her pension amount for the year 2006-07 and 2008-09 to her relative Gracie Fernandez, and asked her to deposit it in her account in the nationalised bank’s branch in the city, where she was working. Gracie had failed to deposit the pension amount to Therasa’s account. When she had asked for an update of her passbook, a manual entry was made, and she had issued a fake receipt. A few days later, when Theresa checked her account details, she realised that her account only had Rs 15,571 instead of Rs 5.4 lakh. When she went to Gracie ‘s house to inquire about the amount, she was threatened by the accused and her husband. Based on a complaint, the accused was arrested and a chargesheet was filed. In November 2016, the second additional senior civil judge and chief judicial magistrate had acquitted Gracie. Allowing the appeal by the state government, she was sentenced to four years jail and fined Rs 12,000 for the offence punishable under various IPC sections . She was also sentenced to two years and imposed a fine of Rs 2000 for the offence punishable under Section 379 of IPC (punishment for theft) and one year and fine of Rs 1,000 for the offence under Section 465 of IPC (punishment for forgery). All the sentences will run concurrently. Out of the total fine amount, Rs 10,000 will be given to the retired teacher as compensation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/bank-employee-convicted-for-cheating-retired-school-teacher/articleshow/87653623.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Bengal guv, govt in war of words on investments||Kolkata: Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar said on Thursday that former Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra’s letter “skipped all the five issues” he had flagged over investments at Bengal Global Business Summit, prompting Bengal government seniors to say that “it cannot respond to the governor’s letter every day.” In September 2020, in a detailed reply to the governor, Mitra — now principal chief adviser to the CM and the finance department — had written that proposals received in BGBS from 2015-19 amounted to Rs 12.3 lakh crore. Dhankhar asked Mitra to specify the places where these investments were under way and also the names of the companies. He also wanted Mitra to update him about the status of implementation and people employed in these projects. “We are answerable to people and not the governor and BJP. The CM was gracious enough to invite him but it is unfortunate that he has chosen to interpret the gesture in this manner,” a top Bengal official said. Dhankhar held that Mitra’s letter didn’t answer the issues he had raised about BGBS. Mitra’s 2020 letter had also mentioned that 50.2% of investment proposals were in implementation mode. He said investment proposals of Rs 71,646 crore at BGBS 2019 were already under implementation, and that “the employment so far was to the tune of 28 lakhs.” The senior Bengal official also wondered if the governor “had the constitutional authority to interfere in everyday administrative affairs of the state and that too in public domain by tweeting”. According to senior officials, none of Dhankhar’s predecessors had done this. “Every time BGBS was held, all proposal details were given to the media on the last day and everything is in public domain,” an official added. Incidentally, the chief minister invited the governor for the meet and greet programme on Monday this week where the dates of BGBS 2022 were announced. The CM also requested the governor to visit a foreign country to promote the state, which the latter accepted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-guv-govt-in-war-of-words-on-investments/articleshow/87655139.cms||---
---||Delhi||Covid-19: Delhi government goes door to door to bring 17.5 lakh in vaccination net||NEW DELHI: Though nearly nine out of 10 adults in the national capital have received at least one dose of vaccine against Covid-19, the Delhi government is carrying out a major drive to identify and vaccinate more than 17.5 lakh people who remain unvaccinated. Till 6pm on Sunday, Delhi had seen a cumulative 2,10,47,046 vaccine doses being administered, including 1,32,49,130 first doses and 77,97,916 second doses. With the number of people eligible for vaccination in Delhi being around 1.5 crore, almost 52% of the adults have been fully vaccinated and 88.3% have received at least one dose. Considering the approximate number of Delhiites who are above the age of 18 years and eligible for the vaccination, more than 17.5 lakh adults haven’t received a single dose. The number is a cause of concern and was discussed in a meeting of Delhi Disaster Management Authority in October, sources said. The Delhi government has started a house-to-house survey, which is part of the decision taken in the DDMA meeting to implement a “targeted approach” to reach out to the remaining eligible beneficiaries without even a single dose of vaccine, they added. The survey is being carried out by civil defence volunteers to identify the population that has been left out either due to vaccine hesitancy or any other reason. The government is also carrying out an extensive information, education and communication campaign to create awareness, including awareness about the necessity of getting the second dose on time. Mobile teams have also been mobilised at district levels to reach out to non-vaccinated beneficiaries. The vaccination by these teams are carried out from vehicles or small sites in localities. Camps are also set up near locations of Chhath Puja celebrations this week. The government is going to organise more special camps, sources said. While a huge dip was seen in the number of vaccine doses being administered in the first week of November during the festive season, the numbers have started climbing up. The average number of vaccine doses in the first week of November was 36,532 doses a day, but on the first four days of the current week, more than 80,000 cumulative doses have been administered, except on Wednesday. North West district has administered the highest number of total vaccine doses at 25,05,395, followed by South West at 24,38,521 and West at 22,55,632. On the other hand, North East district has seen the least number of total doses at 13,49,225.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-goes-door-to-door-to-bring-17-5-lakh-in-vax-net/articleshow/87655627.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The victims are Bilal Wani (35) and Sabir Batt (36), both residents of Pahalgaon police station area of Jammu and Kashmir. Wani has lodged a complaint with Doranda police station in this regard. The police have nabbed the accused identified as Raj Kishore alias Kishori, a resident of Pathal Road in Doranda. Wani said when he, along with Batt, reached the Hathikhana colony, Kishori tried to force them to shout “Jai Shri Ram” and “Pakistan murdabad”. He said the accused started assaulting them when they refused and they were saved only when local people intervened. Wani said similar assaults have occurred against other Kashmiri youths several times in the recent past. The police sent both of them to the local hospital for adequate treatment. Wani said, “As soon as we started displaying our products before a customer in Doranda the accused approached us and asked to shout the slogans if we wanted to stay here. He started hitting us with his fist and leg while asking his brother for a gun to shoot me.” Wani said he is also a citizen of this country and has all the rights to stay wherever he wants. He mentioned that he has been visiting Ranchi for the past 20 years to sell woollens. Ranchi senior superintendent of police Surindra Jha said, “The accused in the case Raj Kishore alias Kishori has been arrested. He is a drug addict.

There are also reports of gold chains snatching from the same area. Two minors have been detained for questioning in this connection, police said. Though police complaints are yet to be lodged, there is information that similar incidents took place in other parts of Jamshedpur too at various river ghats. Before the commencement of the Chhath, district police had assured that it would post policemen in plain clothes at all river ghats to thwart such thefts and snatching incidents. In another incident under Azadnagar police station area, thieves broke into a house and decamped with gold ornaments and valuables worth around Rs 3 lakh. A complaint has been filed in this connection. House burglary reports have been filed at Parsudih police station too. Sources said that when the family members had gone to their relative’s house to take part in Chhath, thieves broke into their house and decamped with valuables. Sources said family members had gone to the river ghat to perform Chhath, when goons broke into the house and stole valuables on Thursday morning. In neighbouring Seraikela-Kharsawan district, there are reports of firing between two rival gangs at a Chhath ghat on Thursday. Police said one Vikki Nandi was the target of the goons. Vikki and two other women present at the spot were injured in the attack. They are undergoing treatment. Police have recovered cartridges from the spot. Sources said the firing was a fallout of an old rivalry between Vikki and other miscreants in the area. Taking advantage of the large gathering, the goons had come to kill Vikki at the ghat, said the victim’s relatives. Police added they are going through the CCTV footage from the cameras installed at that spot to find those involved in the attack. Police assured that those involved will be in their net soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/thieves-burglars-have-a-field-day-as-devotees-throng-ghats-for-chhath/articleshow/87654183.cms||Debasish Chatterjee
---||Ranchi||JMM, Congress against November 15 as Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas||RANCHI: Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Congress, the two key parties governing Jharkhand, on Thursday reacted to the Centre’s decision to observe tribal revolutionary Birsa Munda’s birth anniversary as Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas. The two political outfits vocally opposed the announcement and claimed that the Narendra Modi-led government must include Sarna religious code in the upcoming census if it really wanted to give the tribal communities their due honour. JMM’s Giridih MLA and party general secretary Sudivya Kumar said, “Sarna religious code is associated with the very existence of the tribal communities and a resolution was also passed by Jharkhand Vidhan Sabha in this regard. If the Union cabinet approves a separate Sarna religious code, it will actually be an honest effort to preserve the existence of the tribal communities.” Congress called the announcement a political agenda. “When there was a double government in Jharkhand under former chief minister Raghubar Das, nothing was done to give the tribal revolutionaries of the state their due honour. Now, when the BJP is not in power, they have suddenly remembered Bhagwan Birsa Munda,” Jharkhand Congress president Rajesh Thakur told TOI on Thursday. He added, “It is nothing but a political agenda. None of the 12 BJP MPs from Jharkhand could ever muster the courage to seek a separate religious code for the practitioners for Sarna religious faith in the Parliament. And here they are, using Bhagwan Birsa Munda’s name to strike a chord with the people for their political gains.” Soon after the Union cabinet’s announcement, BJP lawmakers in the state joined the bandwagon in thanking Modi. State BJP president Deepak Prakash and former CM Babulal Marandi called the announcement a recognition for the fighting spirit of the tribal communities of the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/sarna-code-not-gaurav-diwas-real-tribute-to-tribal-communities-jmm-cong/articleshow/87653983.cms||Dhritiman Ray

The inauguration will officially mark the first Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas, which was announced by the Union cabinet on Wednesday. The Union government aims to celebrate the valour of tribal revolutionaries through the Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas. Jharkhand celebrates its statehood day on November 15, which is the birth anniversary of tribal revolutionary Birsa Munda. The park has been built in and around the 200-year-old Ranchi Central Jail. It was in this jail that Birsa Munda, who is regarded as one of India’s tallest revolutionaries, died in British captivity on June 9, 1900. Envisioned in 2013, the park has been built under the patronage of the Union ministry of tribal affairs at a cost of Rs 26 crore by the state urban development development’s subsidiary Jharkhand Urban Infrastructure Development Company (JUIDCO). Once inaugurated, the 15-acre facility will be operated under public private partnership (PPP) under the watch of Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC). “A committee has been set up for drafting the operational policies. The draft will be then put up before the cabinet for its approval,” a JUIDCO official said. “Besides PM Modi, who will remain virtually present, Governor Ramesh Bais, chief minister Hemant Soren and Union tribal affairs minister Arjun Munda will attend the event in-person in Ranchi. State tribal affairs minister Champai Soren, Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth, Ranchi MLA CP Singh and Ranchi mayor Asha Lakra will also attend the event,” a senior official in the urban development department said on anonymity. Though state urban development secretary Vinay Kumar Choubey could not be contacted, Munda’s office confirmed the inauguration. The present day park was chosen by Soren during his first stint as CM in 2013 for restoration of the old jail. Later, when BJP was voted to power in 2014 the construction for setting up a museum began during the tenure of erstwhile CM Raghubar Das. It was held up on multiple occasions. Three separate agencies were roped in for restoring the old jail building, setting up the museum and landscaping of the complex. The restoration of the jail building, which will house the museum, was completed in 2019. Besides Birsa, the museum will house statues of 10 tribal revolutionaries from Jharkhand. There will be light and sound shows and visitors will be shown brief documentaries of the tribal heroes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/prime-minister-to-inaugurate-birsa-park-on-tribal-icons-birth-anniv/articleshow/87654096.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Titled The Ugly Side of Beauty, the film digs deep into the hidden world of mica mining in Koderma and Giridih districts and explores the trade that feeds voracious demand for beauty products. But on the flipside, it showcases how the poor and marginalized, including children in these mica-rich districts, continue to battle hunger, poverty, environment and health hazards. The awards took place in Tokyo on November 9 through a virtual ceremony wherein the film received laurels among 267 entries from 48 countries competing this year. The Japan Prize was organised by NHK (Japanese broadcaster), said the makers. Established in 1965 by NHK, the Japan Prize is an international contest that honours the top educational programmes worldwide. The film is produced by The Moving Visuals Co. in Singapore. While Deepak was roped in from India for this project, other key players for this film included Sumitra Gopal (producer), and Galen Yeo (creative director). This Sunday, Bara has now scheduled an open screening of the film at city-based XISS. Talking to TOI on Thursday, Bara said the main aim behind making a documentary on this subject was to initiate debate around the raging problem surrounding mica industry in Jharkhand for decades and prompting authorities to wake up. He said, “Even in undivided Bihar, there wasn’t any consolidated policy for regulating mica industry here. After creation of Jharkhand too, nothing has been done so far. As a result, about 10 lakh people, mostly tribals in Koderma and Giridih, are forced to do illegal mica mining risking their lives but end up earning less than minimum wages per day. Over the years, people are living in disastrous zone here.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/docu-on-mica-bags-international-award/articleshow/87653954.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Participating in the Times Now Summit, he claimed that the ‘Muslim vote bank’ was a myth that was shatttered by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2014 eletions. On the contrary, there has always been a ‘Hindu vote bank’ in the country, he argued. Asked about his views on Muslim communalism, the leader of the Hyderabad-based Muslim outfit said, “Any form of communalism is bad for our country. I am not promoting communalism. What I am saying is that we should get a fair share.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/muslims-must-get-their-fair-share-aimim-chief-owaisi/articleshow/87656518.cms||---
---||India||Government feeding OTT platforms’ growth by allowing self-regulation: Anurag Thakur||NEW DELHI: The media and entertainment industry, and Over The Top (OTT) platforms in particular, will fuel economic and job growth in the next few years and government encourages this trend by allowing OTT platforms to self-regulate, information and broadcasting and sports minister Anurag Thakur said at the Times Now Summit on Thursday. Acknowledging the exponential growth of OTT platforms, Thakur said the media and entertainment industry is projected to be worth Rs 4 lakh crore by 2025 and that OTT platforms alone have the potential to employ 80 lakh persons. With expected investments worth Rs 30,000 crore in the next three years, of which 45% is likely to be through FDI, Thakur said India is also the world’s 6th largest OTT market, despite still being in its nascent stages of growth. He did not agree with claims of “over censorship” by the government and said OTT platforms have been allowed to self-regulate. “There is a three-tier mechanism for complaint redressal and 95% of the complaints they received are settled at their own level,” he said. Congratulating Times Now Navbharat for its proposed launch on the Standard Definition platform effective January 1 next year, Union I&B minister Anurag Thakur said, “We all want Navbharat to be prosperous and powerful. In this, the role of Times Now Navbharat is also significant; for delivering accurate news to the masses. For this I congratulate you all.” In his capacity as sports minister, he said the government has taken several steps to step-up training facilities for elite and upcoming athletes through initiatives like Mission Olympic Cell and Khelo India, and that the ministry will, in the coming months, launch app-based training modules for coaches and athletes to ensure that international best practices reach the maximum number of aspiring sportspersons. Thakur also said social media platforms are powerful tools to inform people, but condemned recent instances of Indian cricket players being targeted on social media for their performances. “Social media is for you to state your point of view, but not to make objectionable statements about anyone . Those who represent India put in every effort for the country and it is absolutely condemnable when someone is targeted over their religion or poor performance,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-feeding-ott-platforms-growth-by-allowing-self-regulation-anurag-thakur/articleshow/87656504.cms||---
---||Delhi||Murders down, street crimes rising in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Murders, the prime indicator of the crime situation in a city, declined this year, Delhi Police data shows. From 393 murders reported till October 31 last year, 379 were lodged in the same time period this year. Sources said the number of crime-related murders were fewer and a majority were the fallout of personal enmity and sudden provocation with the accused and the victim being known to each other. Overall, heinous crimes rose slightly with 4,614 cases reported in 2020 against 4,666 this year. With lockdowns imposed due to the pandemic being lifted, crimes on road, like vehicle thefts and snatchings, seemed to be heading back to their pre-Covid numbers of 2019. Vehicle thefts, for example, rose by around 9% with 31,374 cases registered till October 31 this year against 28,732 last year. Throughout 2020, around 35,000 cases were reported. In 2019 and the year before, over 46,000 cases were reported. There was a slight increase in crimes like dacoity (8 last year and 20 this year) and kidnapping for ransom (10 last year against 15 this year). Fatal and non-fatal accidents also rose in 2021, something attributed to vehicles getting back on the roads in full capacity. While 958 fatal accidents were reported till October 31 this year, the figure was 908 in 2020. In all, 2,823 non-fatal accidents were reported this year against 2,486 cases in 2020. While 688 cases of riots (mostly in northeast Delhi) were reported last year, 58 cases were lodged this year. Most districts were able to keep street crime under check this year. Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana had instructed all joint and special commissioners to focus on reducing street crimes in their respective zones. With the integration of PCR vans and their personnel with police station staff and separation of law and order duties from crime investigation, things appeared bright strength-wise, said officers. Asthana is learnt to have asked all DCPs to prepare a roadmap for the coming months by conducting studies in their areas to map crime hotspots. Special Cell and Crime Branch have been tasked with escalating crackdown on gunrunners and related syndicates to curb the influx of arms and ammunition in the capital. Action is being taken against members of organised crime syndicates under MCOCA and coordination with jail administration is being done to curb their illegal activities inside the prisons, a senior officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/murders-down-street-crimes-on-the-up/articleshow/87655045.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ED raids over fraud linked to Nawab Malik-controlled Wakf Board||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED), as part of a money laundering probe, on Thursday raided premises of six people in Pune for fraudulently claiming nearly Rs 8 crore compensation in lieu of surrendering land belonging to a trust registered with the Wakf Board. The Wakf Board comes under the state minority development minister, Nawab Malik of the NCP. No search was conducted on any office of the Wakf Board, which is the complainant in the related police case. Malik also said that ED had not raided any Wakf Board office. It is stated that the six people who had received state government compensation in their personal accounts are suspected to be a front for some powerful persons. The ED is probing the money trail to trace the beneficiaries. The money laundering case is based on an FIR filed at the Bund Garden police station in Pune in August 2021 by the Pune regional officer of the Maharashtra Wakf Board. Accused forged NOC, got Rs 8 crore payout from govt for trust landRecently, the ED collected documents related to the Pune police case and subsequently registered the money laundering case. Early on Thursday, ED officials formed seven teams, and they raided the premises of thesix accused, who were believed to have acted on the instructions of someone else. The ED has recorded the statement of five of the accused persons and accordingly will decide the next course of action, sources said. Sources stated "the six persons are from the lower strata of life and not capable of committing the crime of such a magnitude, to cheat the government. One of the six accused is on the run." According to the case, the Tabut Inam Endowment Trust, registered with Wakf Board, owned a piece of land at Maan Village, Mulshi taluka,in Pune district. The government acquired the land for the Rajiv Gandhi IT Park and announced Rs 8.76 crore as compensation to the land owner. The accused, reportedly in connivance with some other persons, represented themselves as office-bearers of the Tabut trust and forged a Wakf Board NOC to get Rs 7.9 crore compensation released by the government. The accused were exposed after the trust complained to Wakf Board that it did not receive compensation in lieu ofits land. During further inquiry, it was disclosed six persons had represented themselves as office-bearers of the trust and, with help of fabricated documents, convinced the collector's office to release compensation. The demand draft was deposited into personal accounts of the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-ed-raids-over-fraud-linked-to-nawab-malik-controlled-wakf-board/articleshow/87656590.cms||Vijay Singh

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Curfew imposed in Amravati as bandh call turns violent||NAGPUR: Internet services were shut down and a four-day curfew was imposed on Saturday in Amravati, about 150 kms from Nagpur, as the bandh call by a political party turned violent. BJP's bandh call was in response to Friday's rallies by certain organizations to protest alleged the communal flare up in Tripura, which resulted in some shops and offices being damaged. On Saturday, the bandh turned violent after police received reports of stone pelting and damage of vehicles and shops. Police lathicharged the mob in an effort to disperse the crowd, while also appealing to everyone to return home. On Saturday morning, hundreds of people, many of them holding saffron flags in their hands and raising slogans, came out on streets in Rajkamal Chowk area of the eastern Maharashtra city, located around 670 km from Mumbai. Some members of the mob hurled stones at shops in Rajkamal Chowk and other places, the police official said, adding that the police lathi-charged the protesters to bring the situation under control.  Against the backdrop of back-to-back incidents of stone-pelting on Friday and Saturday, additional police commissioner Sandip Patil issued orders imposing curfew in the city limits of Amravati under sections 144(1), (2), (3) of the CrPc to avoid any untoward incidents. Except for medical emergencies, people are not allowed to come out of houses. A gathering of more than five people is not allowed, as per the order. On Friday, over eight thousand people had gathered outside the Amravati district collector's office to submit a memorandum demanding that atrocities against the minority community be stopped, officials had said. When people were leaving after submitting the memorandum, stone-pelting took place at three places between Chitra Chowk and Cotton Market under the limits of the Kotwali police station. On Friday, stone-pelting was reported during rallies taken out by Muslim organisations to protest against incidents in Tripura at Amravati, Nanded, Malegaon, Washim and Yavatmal. Police have so far arrested 20 people and detained four others by registering 20 FIRs under various charges, including rioting, in connection with Friday's incidents. In Amravati, over 8,000 people had gathered outside the district collector's office on Friday to submit a memorandum demanding that atrocities against the minority community in Tripura be stopped. When people were leaving after submitting the memorandum, stone-pelting took place at three places between Chitra Chowk and Cotton Market under the limits of the Kotwali police station. On Saturday, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis said, “I appeal to both communities to remain calm and maintain law and order. The entire flare up is over something which never took place in Tripura, in fact the police there have released photos showing that no place of worship was damaged. Yet on social media some people instigated citizens and caused this furore." After minor incidents of stone-pelting reported on Friday from Nanded, Amravati and Malegaon (Nashik), home minister Dilip Walse-Patil made a late-night video appeal for restrain from all groups. "Please maintain calma I appeal to all Hindus and Muslims brethren to maintain peace," Walse-Patil urged, along with other leaders of Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. "I am monitoring the entire situation with the help of senior police officers and discussing with senior Opposition leaders. All those guilty would not be spareda We all must maintain social harmony and I request all to cooperate with us. I request the same to my police brothers to handle the situation cautiously and to maintain peace," he added. Meanwhile, launching a veiled attack on opposition BJP, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Saturday said the violence in Amravati and other places was aimed at destabilising the MVA government.  Speaking to reporters in Aurangabad, Raut said the state government is firm in the saddle and real faces of the perpetrators of violence will be exposed soon. "Raising the bogey of violence, they (Opposition) will meet the state governor and write letters to the Union home ministry claiming that the (law and order) situation in Maharashtra is deteriorating. This will happen in the future too. But the state government is firm in the saddle," Raut said. Amravati district guardian minister Yashomati Thakur said some anti-social elements are trying to vitiate the atmosphere by throwing stones at shops. "The state government will take necessary action. However, some people are using this for political gains," she said and appealed to people to not believe rumours. AIMIM MP Imtiaz Jaleel has also condemned the violence in Amravati. "I want to question those leaders in the state who came to power by taking the votes of Muslims why they didn't condemn the violence in Tripura. If this violence in Maharashtra is a 'tit for tat' by any political party then this is the example of irresponsibility," he said.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Supreme Court nixes panel's view that roadside trees 'not forest'||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday expressed scepticism on the view of a committee it had itself set up when the panel submitted that extending the definition of 'forest' to 'planted trees on non-notified land' will only discourage planting of trees along roadsides on common land. The panel's reply was filed on an application by DMRC seeking the SC's nod for felling of trees for construction of Phase IV of the Metro project, which would be 20 km long, from Aerocity to Tughlakabad. Around 10,000 trees will have to be axed for the project. A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao, B R Gavai and B V Nagarathna, which is examining DMRC's plea, said the stand taken by the committee could not be accepted. "We are not going to accept that all planted trees are not forest. It would lead to chaos. Who will decide whether a tree is planted one or grown naturally?" it asked. Advocate A D N Rao, appearing for the committee, contended that the panel took the stand on the basis of the apex court's earlier verdict in 1996 that trees planted in a project area cannot be branded as forests. "The Government of India guidelines specifically exclude all plantations raised outside the notified forests/recorded forests from the purview of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. Only lands with naturally grown trees outside the notified/reserved forest are treated as deemed forest," the committee said. "It is therefore recommended for consideration of this court that the prayer of the applicant to declare that the 5.34 km stretch of Road No. 26 between Vikaspuri to Peeragarhi, 1288.973 sqm land at Najafgarh drain, 16097.75 sqm land located at Mangolpuri and 55.78 sqm of Krishna Park are nonforest areas is allowed, subject to the condition that the DMRC will fell the trees only after obtaining permission under the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994 from the concerned authorities and after complying with the conditions associated with such approvals, including compensatory planting of 10 times the number of trees close to the site from where the trees are being felled," the committee said. The court proceedings also witnessed the Delhi government and Centre opposing each other fiercely on the issue with Delhi's counsel contended that the area was part of forest and the showcause notice is being issued for felling of trees. The solicitor general accused Delhi of blocking the Metro project, which is a lifeline of the people. Advocate Chirag Shroff, for Delhi govt, also raised an objection to Tushar Mehta, appearing for DMRC, saying that there was a conflict of interest between the Centre and DMRC. Mehta, also appearing for the environment ministry, told the bench that the Centre was not against the project like Delhi government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-supreme-court-nixes-panels-view-that-roadside-trees-not-forest/articleshow/87656616.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

The agency is also using diplomatic channels in getting their hands on the two suspects — C Prabhakar Reddy aka ‘Punch’ Prabhakar and Mani Annapureddy — in the case after locating their whereabouts using a Blue Notice. The CBI also moved through Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) channel for gathering the information related to the Facebook profiles, Twitter accounts, Facebook posts, tweets, YouTube videos from Facebook, Twitter, Google details etc of the suspects. A CBI spokesperson informed on Thursday that the agency had got arrest warrants issued against the two persons and had also filed six more chargesheets in the case. The six accused were arrested by CBI on October 22 from different places in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and are presently in judicial custody. The suspects have been accused of making objectionable comments on judges of judges of the Andhra Pradesh high court over certain verdicts. The CBI’s move to seek international assistance in the case comes in the wake of the Supreme Court expressing its annoyance with the failure of the investigating agencies to nab the accused. In August this year, a bench headed by Chief Justice of India N V Ramana rued that judges were not on priority for investigating agencies and that their complaints of being harassed or intimidated were not heeded despite specialised bodies like CBI being roped in. The CBI had had earlier arrested five accused in July and August and also filed five separate chargesheets against them. With this, 11 separate chargesheets have been filed against all the 11 accused arrested so far in the case. The agency has also examined Lok Sabha MP Nandigam Suresh and former MLA Amanchi Krishnamohan, both belonging to YSR Congress, in the case. The CBI had registered the case on November 11 last year against 16 people and taken over investigation of 12 FIRs from CID, Andhra Pradesh, in pursuance of the orders of the high court. The original FIRs were registered on complaints of Registrar General of high court of Andhra Pradesh. The agency has also had many of the objectionable posts removed and YouTube channels blocked from the social media platforms and public domain. During investigation, a total of 13 digital gadgets including mobiles, tablets have been recovered, the CBI informed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/for-judge-slur-cbi-seeks-deportation-of-2-from-us/articleshow/87656634.cms||Rajshekhar Jha

We are declaring names for the people of Goa and let the party be decided later,” he said. “I’m a BJP MLA and will speak to the party and if they don’t listen to us then other options are open,” the minister said. Lobo said that the people of Goa will decide who will form the next government in Goa When asked from which party he, his wife Delilah and Sudhir Kandolkar will contest, Lobo said, “I have given names of probable candidates, these are good candidates and people are searching for good candidates. There is no problem even if they are from the opposition.” Asked about the talk in political circles that he wants to have control over Bardez taluka, Lobo said there is nothing like that. “We will go across the state and tell people to elect good people because it is not a question of five months, it is of five years,” he said. “It is not like that,” Lobo said when asked whether it is an indication that he will not continue with BJP. “We want good candidates. People of Goa want good candidates so that their work is addressed and solved, whether it is water or electricity. We are fighting for basic things.” “I will announce the names of more candidates not only in Bardez, but beyond Bardez. We will announce names of candidates who will work for people and I will take the responsibility of that candidate. When I take the name of Kandolkar, and if he does not perform, then it is our responsibility,” he said. Lobo said that he is not eying the chief minister’s post. He said that he will study and announce the name for Aldona constituency. Further, he said that if the sitting MLA is good, then there is no need to announce other names.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lobo-will-announce-more-candidates-for-22-polls-let-party-be-decided-later/articleshow/87654887.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Seek nod, pay fees to erect shacks in port limits: MPT||Vasco: Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) has no problem with shacks being erected at Baina beach and nearby beaches, but shack operators need to obtain the requisite permission from the port authorities and pay the stipulated fees first, said MPT deputy chairman Guru Prasad Rai on Thursday. Rai said that MPT wants to encourage tourism in the state and is willing to co-operate with Goa Tourism and Development Corporation in the shack allotment process. MPT is facing a backlash after it stopped the erection of two shacks at Baina beach citing lack of permission issues. “Anything that is to be established in port waters and port jurisdiction, needs to take permission from the port. In future also, whenever the state government is allotting permission for shacks, we will go and check the feasiblity and give permission,” said Rai. Rai’s statement is in consonance with the Major Port Authorities Act, 2021 which supersedes Goa’s planning laws. Deputy chief minister and town and country planning minister Chandrakant Kavlekar had admitted in the state legislative assembly that Goa would lose revenue ideally owed to the state for the development that is undertaken in certain zones. “The likely implications include redundancy of Goa Town & Country Planning Act, 2021 and the Regional Plan or outline development plans, Goa Municipalities Act, Goa Panchayat Raj Act, Goa Land Development and Building Construction Regulations, 2010 and Goa Land Revenue Code,” Kavlekar had said in February. Kavlekar said that areas in the periphery of Mormugao Port Trust could come under the “ownership” of MPT, while local powers of the state, including the power to allot shacks in MPTs jurisdiction, would be lost. Chief minister Pramod Sawant had written to the Union ports minister on June 17 conveying Goa’s concerns regarding the Major Ports Authorities Act, 2021, but the Centre brushed aside Goa’s apprehensions. Urban development minister and Mormugao MLA Milind Naik said that there is a misunderstanding, and that he has spoken to the state government to clear the matter with MPT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/seek-nod-pay-fees-to-erect-shacks-in-port-limits-mpt/articleshow/87654936.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Shack owners seek CM’s help to carry on business at Baina||Panaji: The Shack Owners Welfare Society (SOWS) has sought the intervention of chief minister Pramod Sawant to deter Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) from interfering with shack allottees at the Baina and Arossim beaches in South Goa. The plea comes after two allottees at Baina beach were allegedly stopped by MPT officials earlier this week over claims that the beach stretch where the shacks were allotted lay in its jurisdiction. “We have informed both the chief minister and the tourism minister about this issue. The CM should talk directly to the MPT. If not stopped, I’m afraid it will allot the space to people from outside Goa,” SOWS president Cruz Cardozo told TOI. “It is unfortunate that the shack operators have lost over a month after having endured two bad seasons due to the MPT’s objections.” He explained that shack operators have been setting up their structures at the two beaches for years and that the MPT has no rights there. Allottees at Baina had faced similar problems during the last season too, with MPT raising objections, he recalled, following which the issue was sorted with government intervention. Shacks are allotted by the tourism department along all beach stretches after assessing the post-monsoon condition of each beach. The exercise has been conducted every season for over three decades now. Two shacks are allotted for Baina beach and four for Arossim. While the allottees at Arossim have erected their structures despite objections, those at Baina are yet to set up. The SOWS, Cardozo said, has written to the tourism department apprising it of the issue. “We were informed by the tourism director that the department has written to the MPT instructing it not to interfere,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/shack-owners-seek-cms-help-to-carry-on-business-at-baina/articleshow/87654892.cms||---

Assured by Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant a couple of months ago that they would not have to pay for piped water from September 1, the PWD water consumers, most of them holding blue-collar jobs, are wondering how to pay the bills. Sangolda resident Saraswati (name changed), who used to get a water bill of Rs 500 on an average, suddenly found herself staring at a bill of Rs 3,387. “I went to the staff at the Porvorim office, who told me that there must be a leakage. If there is leakage, why were the earlier bills lower? I asked him if we are supposed to spend all our earnings to pay the water bill, to which he snapped back and told me to complain to the government,” she said. Two months ago, Sawant had announced that Goa would become the first state in the country to supply water free of cost to its citizens. He had launched the ‘Save Water to Get Free Water’ scheme under which households would not be charged for consumption up to 16,000 litres per month. When TOI reached out to a PWD official, he explained that the bills could be on the higher side if the billing period was more than 30 days. He said that due to the Covid-19 pandemic, meter readers were not going to certain areas where infections were high. “If the locality has a high number of Covid-19 cases, the meter reader could himself contract the virus, and thus, meter readings are not taken for a month or two,” said the official who is not authorised to give a statement. The PWD issues water bills for 30-45 days, but in this case, Saraswati’s bill was for 70 days. Several other residents of Porvorim also complained of receiving inflated water bills, but TOI could not get copies of the bills. They complained that given the erratic water supply, the inflated bills made no sense. “As it is, the flow of water is a trickle and supply is erratic, so much so that we have to draw water from our neighbours wells,” said Saraswati.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/inflated-bills-shock-users-as-free-water-promise-runs-out/articleshow/87654925.cms||---
