In terms of ranking India is at 18. The index highlights that the global dominance of drug policies based on repression and punishment has led to low scores overall, with a median score of just 48 out of 100 for all 30 countries which is assessed as a “drug policy failure” and a sign for urgent measures to deal with the situation. “48 out of 100 is a drug policy fail in anyone’s book. This index highlights the huge room for improvement across the board,” said Ann Fordham, executive director of the International Drug Policy Consortium which led the development of the index with the partners in the Harm Reduction Consortium. Reflecting a long-standing global trend towards the abolition of the death penalty, the report highlights that only three out of these 30 countries - India, Indonesia and Thailand retain capital punishment for certain drug offences. “The death penalty for drug offences is contrary to international human rights standards, which ban capital punishment for all but the ‘most serious’ offences, that is crimes of extreme gravity involving intentional killing,” the report said. This index comes at a time when the Indian government is reviewing the provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act 1985. Recently, the ministry of social justice and empowerment as part of its suggestions to the revenue department of the ministry of finance recommended that users and dependents caught with small quantities of drugs and their families should be treated as “victims” and not culprits and suggested compulsory treatment and rehab instead of jail terms and penalties for such users. The report in its analysis of policy and its implementation in 2020 brings to fore that there is a huge gap between government policies and their implementation on ensuring access to controlled medicines (for relief of pain and suffering), especially in countries like India, Indonesia, Mexico, and Senegal which score high on policy, but score zero out of 100 for actual availability of these controlled medicines for those in need. The inaugural edition of the index released by the Harm Reduction Consortium shows that Norway, New Zealand, Portugal, the UK and Australia are the five leading countries on humane and health driven drug policies. Brazil, Uganda, Indonesia, Kenya, and Mexico are the five lowest-ranking countries. The index measures and compares national-level drug policies, providing each country with a score and ranking that shows how much their drug policies and their implementation align with the UN principles of human rights, health and development. The analysis shows that drug law enforcement targets primarily non-violent offences, and especially people who use drugs: only eight out of the 30 countries surveyed have decriminalised drug use and possession, and out of those, only three managed to truly divert people away from the criminal justice system. On the positive side, most countries’ policy and strategy documents explicitly support harm reduction. However, implementation is a cause for concern.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/global-drug-index-shows-how-most-countries-fail-drug-policy-test/articleshow/87593194.cms||Ambika Pandit

---||World||Vice President Kamla Harris heads to Paris to work on US-France relationship||WASHINGTON: Vice President Kamala Harris is pitching in on the White House charm offensive aimed at French President Emmanuel Macron. The vice president arrives in Paris on Tuesday for a four-day visit, the latest move in a concerted effort by the Biden administration to shore up the US relationship with America’s oldest ally. Washington’s relations with Paris hit a historic low this year after a US.-British submarine deal with Australia scuttled a French deal with the Australians. Harris will sit down with Macron on Wednesday at the Élysée Palace for talks that are expected to focus on ways the two nations can better coordinate efforts in the Indo-Pacific. The high-level meeting comes less than two weeks after President Joe Biden met Macron on the margins of the Group of 20 summit in Rome and acknowledged that his administration had handled the submarine deal in a “clumsy” way. The U.S. and Britain’s agreement to provide Australia with submarine technology has been framed as opportunity for the U.S. to bolster a key Pacific ally’s naval capacity as the Biden administration has become increasingly concerned about China’s military aggressiveness in the region. But France was livid, saying it was kept in the dark about the deal and its interests were ignored despite having territories in the Indo-Pacific with 2 million people and 7,000 troops. The French also complained that the episode undercut Biden’s message that he would stabilize and strengthen the trans-Atlantic alliance after four years of President Donald Trump’s “America first” approach to foreign policy. France even briefly withdrew its ambassador from the US in protest, the first time it had done so in some 250 years of diplomatic relations between the nations. Harris and Macron are also expected to touch on global health, space and other issues. On Tuesday, Harris is to tour the renowned Institut Pasteur. Harris’ mother, who was a scientist, collaborated with the institute’s scientists on breast cancer research in the 1980s. Harris will deliver a speech on Thursday at the annual Paris Peace Forum and participate the following day in the Paris Conference on Libya. She will be joined by her husband, Douglas Emhoff, for the visit. The vice president is looking to pick up where Biden left off in Rome in efforts to make clear that that he sees the relationship with France as critical to the US. To that end, she and Emhoff will visit Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial just outside Paris. The 7.5-acre (3 hectare) cemetery contains the remains of 1,559 Americans who died in World War I and 23 unknown dead of World War II. Harris will also participate in a ceremony to mark Armistice Day, the French commemoration of the end of World War I. Thursday is also Veterans Day in the United States.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/vice-president-kamla-harris-heads-to-paris-to-work-on-us-france-relationship/articleshow/87593358.cms||---
---||India||States withdrawing consent to CBI ‘not desirable position’: SC||NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over eight states not permitting CBI to investigate cases, the Supreme Court on Monday said “it is not a desirable position” and decided to examine the issue. The court took note of the affidavit filed by CBI director SK Jaiswal in which he said that the CBI’s functioning as an investigating agency and also as a prosecuting authority was being hampered with eight states — West Bengal, Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Mizoram — having withdrawn their general consent, forcing the agency to approach states to get consent on a case-to-case basis. Directed by the apex court to place a “report card” on the CBI’s efficiency as a prosecuting agency, the director told the court that these eight states consented in less than 18% of cases out of 150 requests made by the agency from 2018 to June, 2021. He also pointed out that delay in trial is also caused because of stays granted by HCs. The director said that the CBI’s legal department is at present handling 13,291 appeals pending in sessions courts, HCs and the SC. He also gave details of pending trials in 9,757 cases — in 500 cases trial had been pending for more than 20 years and in 921 cases for 15-20 years. The bench said that both the issues needed to be examined and issued notice to all concerned states and high courts. Times ViewThis is what happens when there’s mistrust over the functioning of central agencies. That’s why it is important that agencies are not seen as partisan and do a professional job. States too should only raise objections when necessary, rather than try to score political points.The CBI said that the problem faced by the agency is because of the “peculiar nature” of the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act, 1946 which regulates the CBI. As per the law, the CBI requires the consent of the state government to conduct investigation within its territorial jurisdiction. “Requests in approximately 78% of cases were pending, which mainly pertained to bank frauds of high magnitude impacting the economy of the country. The delay caused in taking up cases by the CBI due to any of the reasons mentioned above, at times, leads to destruction or dissipation of evidence. This is detrimental not only for the investigation by the CBI but also for subsequent prosecution of cases,” Jaiswal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/states-withdrawing-consent-to-cbi-not-desirable-position-sc/articleshow/87593498.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: CM Yogi Adityanath intensifies political spadework in west UP with back-to-back visits||LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s visits to Kairana in Shamli and Rampur on Monday marked the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) strategy of putting its saffron mascot on the front for escalating the political spadework in the restive west UP region ahead of the assembly elections. The visits are crucial as Kairana was at the centre stage during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections after BJP had ratcheted up the issue of Hindu exodus following the 2013 Muzaffarnagar communal riots, while Rampur is the bastion of Samajwadi Party (SP) MP Azam Khan. Informed party sources said Yogi is likely to visit Mathura, Meerut and Saharanpur in quick succession in the next few days. In Mathura, on November 10, Yogi will inaugurate the ‘Braj Raj Utsav’ which is being organised by Braj Teerth Vikas Board. On November 11, the CM will felicitate Paralympics sportspersons from across the state in Meerut. Plans are also afoot for CM’s visit to Saharanpur where he will lay the foundation stone of the Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) centre in Deoband. The state government had in August green flagged the project, which entails setting up a commando centre over 2,000 sq mt. The move had come under sharp criticism as the opposition termed it a ‘polarisation bid’ of the BJP government. UP BJP organisation secretary and in charge of Saharanpur, Chandra Mohan said the development of west UP has been high on CM Yogi’s agenda. “His visits to the region will speed up the ongoing development projects being carried out by the state government,” he said. Yogi’s move to step up campaign in west UP also gains pertinence in the backdrop of farmers’ continuing protest against the new farm laws. The Lakhimpur violence in which eight persons, including four protesting farmers, were killed had further stoked political frenzy in the region having a sizeable presence of Dalits and Muslims. The development also draws a noticeable contrast from the politically crucial east UP region that has been hogging the spotlight amid the opposition’s concerted attempts for gaining a foothold in PM Narendra Modi’s constituency Varanasi and CM Yogi’s political backyard Gorakhpur. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav is planning to set the political temperature soaring by kicking off the third phase of his ‘Vijay Yatra’ from Gorakhpur on November 13. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has already visited Varanasi and Gorakhpur and addressed rallies. BJP too is digging in its heels in east UP where Union home minister Amit Shah will lay the foundation stone of a university in Azamgarh, the parliamentary constituency of Akhilesh, on November 13. The inauguration of the 341km Purvanchal Expressway connecting Lucknow with Ghazipur by PM Narendra Modi at Sultanpur on November 16 would further reinforce BJP’s development narrative ahead of polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-cm-yogi-adityanath-intensifies-political-spadework-in-west-up-with-back-to-back-visits/articleshow/87593379.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Business||Future group companies defer shareholder, creditors meetings for RIL deal approval||NEW DELHI: Future group firms on the direction of the NCLT have deferred meetings of their respective shareholders and creditors, called on November 10 and 11, for seeking approval for the proposed merger into Future Enterprises as part of the Rs 24,713 crore deal with Reliance Retail, according to regulatory filings. The Mumbai Bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Monday directed Future group firms that “no meeting to be held until final order is pronounced on the applications”, said regulatory filings by the Future group firms, including Future Retail, Future Enterprises, Future Lifestyle Fashions and Future Supply Chain Solutions. Pursuant to the representation received from its secured Creditor, Future group firms along with the other transferor companies forming part of the Rs 24,713 crore deal had filed an application before the NCLT praying to reschedule the dates for convening the meetings. The application was heard by NCLT on Monday, it added. Meanwhile, e-Commerce major Amazon, which is contesting the deal, had also filed an application praying for dismissing the application for conducting the meetings, it added. “On hearing the parties at length, the NCLT has reserved the said application as well as the application filed by Amazon for orders. However, the NCLT has directed that no meeting to be held until final order is pronounced on the applications,” the Future group firms said. Accordingly, the meetings "are deferred under the directions of the NCLT and would not be conducted as per their earlier respective schedules,” they informed. Earlier on October 11, several listed transferor firms including Future Retail, Future Consumer, Future Enterprises, Future Lifestyle Fashions, Future Markets Networks and Future Supply Chain Solutions - had informed their shareholders and creditors about the proposed meetings on November 10 and 11. The scheme of arrangement between Future and Reliance Retail, announced in August last year entails consolidation of Future Group's 19 companies operating in retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing assets into one entity -- Future Enterprises Ltd. Future Enterprises Ltd is the transferee company to Reliance Retail. The meetings was called as per the order passed by the NCLT on September 28, that had asked Future group to take approval from its shareholders and creditors over the scheme of arrangement. In August last year, Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd had said it will acquire the retail and wholesale business, and the logistics and warehousing business of Future Group for Rs 24,713 crore. Amazon is contesting the deal through its shares in FCPL and had approached Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC). On October 2020, an interim award was passed by the EA (emergency arbitrator) in favour of Amazon that barred FRL from taking any step to dispose of or encumber its assets or issuing any securities to secure any funding from a restricted party. This was also upheld by SIAC last month and said FRL is a party to the ongoing arbitration between Amazon and Future group in the dispute over sale of its assets to Reliance Retail. Moreover, in a separate filing Future Retail Ltd also informed that it has filed a Special Leave Petition before the Supreme Court against an interim order passed by the High Court of Delhi in an arbitration appeal filed by the company. On Sunday, the independent directors of Future Retail approached the Competition Commission of India (CCI) urging it to revoke the approval it had given to the Amazon Future Coupons Pvt Ltd (FCPL) deal in 2019, alleging the e-commerce major of “making false statements before it”. In November 2019, CCI had given its approval for Amazon to acquire a 49 per cent stake in FCL. FCL is a shareholder in Future Retail Ltd.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/future-group-companies-defer-shareholder-creditors-meetings-for-ril-deal-approval/articleshow/87593689.cms||---
---||Thane||Get Covid-19 jab or lose salary: Thane Municipal Corporation to staffs||THANE: The Thane Municipal Corporation has decided to stop the salaries of all its employees and contract staff who have failed to take the Covid-19 vaccine dose till date, mayor Naresh Mhaske announced Monday. Mhaske informed the media that the decision was taken following a joint meeting with municipal commissioners and senior health officials. "The administration will issue a notification to the effect in the next few days following which Thane could be the only corporation in the Mumbai metropolitan region, and perhaps the state, to make the vaccination mandatory for its employees," he said. “We have decided to make vaccination mandatory for our permanent and temporary staff to get jabbed at the earliest, else forsake their salaries,” said Mhakse while addressing the media adding that a survey of civic employees taking the vaccine was being compiled. “These staffs are at the front line and need to be completely vaccinated first. We gave them enough time but now we will have to act stern for their welfare and that of the city,” he said. Manish Joshi, deputy municipal commissioner, in charge of the health department, said not all health care and front line workers of Thane corporation have been completely vaccinated while few have even skipped the first one. “We will issue a deadline for those to take the missing dose at the earliest and ask them to submit the proof to their concerned head of departments following which we will stop their salaries,” said Joshi. Mhaske justified the decision claiming vaccine percolation in Thane wasn’t encouraging and there was a need to maximise its reach and make the city fully vaccinated. The compulsion is soon likely to be extended to private doctors, housing societies, commercial units and even government hospitals, he said. "We are dispatching nearly 160 plus teams to various housing societies in the nine civic administrative wards to get an idea of the vaccination status," said Mhaske. It may be recalled that several local corporations across the country including those in Punjab, Delhi had mulled imposing restrictions on government staff in the past. Closer home, the Bhiwandi-Nizampur corporation had also issued similar warnings to its teaching staff to get inoculated else forsake their salaries but retracted it immediately. Meanwhile, activist Stalin D questioned the enforcement. “A reply to my RTI query by state and central government agencies clarified taking jabs wasn’t compulsory so how come any civic body forces its staff to get vaccinated. The move, if implemented, is unjust,” he said, claiming he is likely to skip his second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/get-covid-19-jab-or-lose-salary-thane-municipal-corporation-to-staffs/articleshow/87593764.cms||Manoj Badgeri

He is the 12th civilian to be killed since October 2 this year. Mohammad Ibrahim (45) was grievously wounded in Monday’s attack and succumbed to his injuries in hospital, doctors said. Ibrahim was a salesman at the shop of a Kashmiri Pandit, Roshan Lal Mawa, who reopened his small business at Bohri Kadal on May 1, 2019 on returning to the Valley after 29 years. Ibrahim belonged to Ashtangu Ghat in the northern district of Bandipora. The medical superintendent at SMHS hospital, Dr Kanwaljeet Singh, said the victim died after being shot in the chest and abdomen. Mawa had returned to reopen his shop in old Srinagar city and local Muslims celebrating his return had even tied the traditional welcome turban on him and his son, Dr Sandeep Mawa, who had helped fulfil his father’s dream of returning to the valley. "I migrated to Delhi where I did good business. I own a house there, but all these 29 years I have lived like a fish out of water. I always wanted to return to my home, which is Kashmir," Roshan Lal Mawa had said at the time. The constable shot dead on Sunday was Tausif Ahmad. "At about 8 pm, terrorists fired at Jammu & Kashmir police constable Tausif Ahmad near his residence at S D Colony, Batamaloo," a police official said. Eleven civilians have been killed by terrorists between October 2 and 17, including two teachers and pharmacy owner M L Bindroo. Seven of the 11 victims were Muslims, and the remainder, barring one Sikh who was a school principal, were Hindu. IGP (Kashmir zone) Vijay Kumar said terrorists have killed 28 civilians this year. "Out of 28, five were local Hindus/Sikhs, and two migrant Hindu labourers," he said. He said that in all such cases the terrorists had used pistols. "These acts are committed by newly recruited terrorists or those who are about to join terror outfits," he said, adding, "In some cases, OGWs have been found directly involved." Intelligence sources said these killings have been carried out by sleeper cells of terror groups. IGP Kumar said, "We are identifying all such part-time/hybrid terrorists and the strictest action shall be taken against them. We have received several leads and are working on them. We have also been launching operations along with security forces." Mohammad Shafi Dar was the first civilian targeted by terrorists, on October 2, over his alleged links with security forces. Majid Ahmad Gojri, a resident of Chattabal in Srinagar, was the second. Gojri was shot dead by terrorists near Madina Complex in Karan Nagar area on October 2. Pharmacy dealer Makhan Lal Bindroo (68) was shot dead at point-blank range at his shop in Srinagar on October 5. He and his family had remained in Kashmir in the 1990s, when militancy was at its peak. Virender Paswan, a street food vendor in Srinagar’s Lal Bazaar, was shot dead the same day that Bindroo was killed. Paswan was a resident of Bhagalpur, Bihar. Mohammad Shafi Lone, president of a cab stand in Bandipora and a cab driver, was shot dead the same day, and in the same hour, as Bindroo and Paswan. Lashkar terrorist Imtiyaz Ahmad Dar, on the run after killing Shafi, was gunned down by security forces a few days later. Sikh Supinder Kaur, the principal of a higher secondary boys school at Eidgah, was killed on October 7. Deepak Chand, a Hindu from Jammu who was ateacher at Supinder Kaur’s school, was also shot dead at the school the same day. Sagir Ahmed, a carpenter from Saharanpur, UP, was shot dead by terrorists in Pulwama on October 16, the police said. Arbind Kumar Sah (30) was killed by terrorists a few days later. The victim was a golguppa seller in Srinagar and belonged to Banka, Bihar. Raja Reshi Dev, a labourer from Bihar, was shot dead on October 17 in a rented shop where he stayed in Kulgam's Wanpoh. Jogindar Reshi Dev, was also shot dead at the same shop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/terrorists-again-resort-to-selective-attacks-kill-salesman-in-srinagar-within-24-hours-of-shooting-cop-dead/articleshow/87594005.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||India||Middleman got bribes from Rafale makers in 2007-2012: Report||NEW DELHI: French news portal Mediapart has, in a fresh report, alleged pay-offs received by middleman Sushen Gupta from Dassault Aviation for influencing the sale of Rafale fighter jets to India and published documents on Monday claiming them to be ‘bogus invoices’ raised by Gupta against the manufacturer of Rafale and that he received 7.5 million euros as kickbacks between 2007 and 2012. While the report mentions sale of 36 jets, as was done by the NDA government, the period under review coincides with UPA’s term in office. The alleged pay-offs received by Gupta to ‘facilitate’ the Rafale deal during UPA regime has been corroborated by sources in the investigative agencies, who claimed that a probe is pending as the ongoing investigation against the middleman is restricted to the Agusta-Westland bribery case. A separate FIR needs to be registered in the Rafale pay-offs and that will cover Gupta and his benefactors, a source said. The bribes were paid to Gupta through his Mauritius entity Interstellar, according to the French website, in the guise of “dubious IT contracts”. Gupta is one of the prime accused in the alleged laundering of Rs 423 crore bribes received in the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper deal. Interestingly, he had allegedly received much of the VVIP chopper deal pay-offs through his Mauritius-based Interstellar Technologies Ltd. Gupta was arrested by ED in 2019 in the case. In its chargesheet filed against Gupta later, ED had claimed that the AgustaWestland kickbacks moved from one company to another as consultancy fees. From Tunisian entities, the bribe proceeds were transferred to Interstellar Technologies in Mauritius. Dassault Aviation had in April denied all allegations of pay-offs in its supply of 36 Rafale jets to India. It may be recalled that the UPA regime had shortlisted Dassault Aviation for supply of 126 fighter jets but could not conclude the deal due to differences on maintenance costs and other issues that saw negotiations drag on for several years. The deal was recast as a government-to-government contract by NDA and renegotiated to 36 fighters in 2016. After allegations of overpricing and gratification, the deal was cleared by the Supreme Court and the CAG with the latter concluding that it was a little under 3% cheaper than the terms discussed by UPA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/middleman-got-bribes-from-rafale-makers-in-2007-2012-report/articleshow/87594357.cms||---

The restrictions under the Banking Regulation Act 1949, will remain in force for six months from the close of business on November 8, 2021, and are subject to review, RBI said in a statement. According to the central bank, Babaji Date Mahila Sahakari Bank, Yavatmal, should not, without prior approval of RBI in writing, grant or renew any loans and advances, make any investment, and incur any liability. The liability part includes borrowing of funds and acceptance of fresh deposits. Without RBI's nod, the cooperative bank cannot also disburse or agree to disburse any payment, enter into any compromise or arrangement and sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets. "Considering the bank's present liquidity position, a sum not exceeding Rs 5,000 from the total balance across all savings bank or current accounts or any other account of a depositor, may be allowed to be withdrawn, but are allowed to set off loans against deposits subject to the conditions stated in the above RBI directions," the statement said. At the same time, RBI made it clear that the issue of directions should not per se be construed as cancellation of banking license. Babaji Date Mahila Sahakari Bank Ltd will continue to undertake banking business with restrictions till its financial position improves and depending on the circumstances, RBI might consider modifications to the current restrictions. Separately, RBI has extended the restrictions imposed on Millath Co-operative Bank Limited, Davangere, Karnataka, for another three months till February 7, 2022. The restrictions on the Karnataka-based cooperative bank were imposed on April 26, 2019, and have been modified from time to time. Last time, the restrictions were extended till November 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-imposes-curbs-on-babaji-date-mahila-sahakari-bank-caps-withdrawals-at-rs-5000/articleshow/87594427.cms||---
---||India||After Pakistan, China also skips meet on Afghanistan hosted by India||NEW DELHI: China and Pakistan will be missing when the national security chiefs of seven key regional countries gather here on Wednesday for a security dialogue on Afghanistan. The day-long event, the first being hosted by India, will focus on terrorism and related security challenges and uncertainties emerging from Afghanistan which was taken over by the Taliban in August. Pakistan refused to come because of India. China, however, qualified its response. Citing its inability to attend due to “scheduling issues”, Beijing said that they would like to engage India bilaterally on Afghanistan. The Indian government is refraining from clubbing the two refusals, though sources said China’s response may be due to its Pakistan sensitivities. “We were keen on China’s participation,” sources said. The meeting will focus on terrorism, within Afghanistan and across borders: the growth of radicalisation and extremism that might spread from Afghanistan, either by the Taliban and Haqqani network, or IS-K, or just by the power of demonstration to influence populations in all the participating countries. Cross-border movement is another area of concern. A new challenge that faces the region is the threat emanating from the military equipment and weapons left behind by the US troops in Afghanistan. There is apprehension that these could be used to fuel terrorism or feed organised crime networks in the region. The dialogue, sources said, was not new. The first of these was held in Iran in 2018 with five countries — India, Russia, Afghanistan, China and Iran. Pakistan was invited, but refused to join. Iran held the second one in 2019. No invitation has been sent to Afghanistan — not to the Taliban or even the previous government. “None of the participating countries raised the issue of invitation to the Taliban,” sources said. Indian planners reckon that the biggest “deliverable” from the meeting would be a common understanding of the threats faced by the uncertainty in Afghanistan. “We believe there is a high degree of convergence of their sense of threat and ours,” sources said. The dialogue is unlikely to lead to a new security architecture but the Indian side hopes it can evolve into one.

Come April next year, it will be much more easy for the consumers to ascertain the cost in unit terms. To help consumers make a conscious purchase decisions as well as lessen compliance burden on industry players, the Union consumer affairs ministry has amended the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011, whereby companies will be required to print 'unit sale price' on the packaged commodities. Companies selling packaged commodities with a quantity of more than one kilogram should print 'unit sale price' per kg along with the maximum retail price (MRP), a senior consumer affairs ministry official told PTI. For example, a packaged wheat flour of 2.5 kg should have an unit sale price per kg along with the total MRP. Similarly, a packaged commodity of less than one kg quantity should have 'unit sale price' per gram along with the total MRP of the product. Seeking to ease the compliance requirements, the ministry has scrapped the Schedule 2 of the rules under which 19 types of commodities were to be packed in quantities by weight, measure or number in a specified manner. As per that rule, rice or wheat flour for example were required to be packed in 100 gram, 200 gram, 500 gram and 1 kg, 1.25 kg, 1.5 kg. 1.75 kg, 2kg, 5 kg and thereafter in multiples of 5 kg. "But, the industry wanted to sell in different quantities and were seeking approval from the ministry. Some were approved and some were not. To give flexibility, the Schedule 2 of the rules has been scrapped. And, we have brought the unit sale price concept," the official said. According to the official, the decision is based on the best sales practice and will reduce the compliance burden on the part of industry as well as help consumers ascertain the price of the product before making a buying decision. The other change made to the rules is the way MRP is printed on the packaged commodities. Currently, notices get issued to companies if MRP is not printed in a format mentioned in the rules. The current format is: maximum or max retail price Rs xx.xx. If a company mentioned just Rs xx and no put .xx was considered as violation and notices were issued. "Now, we have asked companies to give in the Indian rupees and freed them from any set format," the official said. The third change made to the rules is with regard to mentioning of quantity on a packaged commodity either in 'number' or 'unit' which as per the format is to be mentioned as xxN or xxU on the pack. If a company expressed wrongly as xxNO or xxUO, it was considered to be in violation of the rules and notices were issued. Even mentioning in pairs or pieces on the pack was also a violation, the official said. "This has been changed. Companies were allowed to mention either in the number of units. Now, they have been given the option to mention on the package the items to be shown by number or unit or piece or pair or set of other words which denote quantity," he said. The fourth and last change made to the rules is with regard to the packaged imported commodities. Currently, companies have an option to either mention date of import or date of manufacturing or date of prepackaging. "Now, there won't be an option. Companies have to mention only the date of manufacturing which matters to consumers while buying the product," the official added. The last amendments to the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules 2011 were made in June 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/consumers-to-soon-have-a-reason-to-smile-govt-comes-out-with-unit-sale-price-for-packaged-items/articleshow/87594487.cms||---

The government is concerned that supplies of Zy-CoV-D — a three-dose vaccine given emergency use authorisation (EUA) for children between 12-17 years — may not be adequate to begin inoculating children. Covaxin, currently in use for adults, has already been recommended for use in children of 2-18 years. However, the final approval for EUA is pending with the DCGI. The regulator has been cautious in its approach as the vaccinations concern young children. The official said data has been reviewed thoroughly now and DCGI approval for use of Covaxin in children is expected by end of November. “We will wait for Covaxin to be approved for used in children before opening up Covid immunisation programme. ZyCoV-D supplies are limited and may not suffice to cover all children. Besides, it has been approved only for children above 12 years of age,” the official said. The government plans to initiate vaccination with children with certain health condition that make them more vulnerable to Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-govt-to-start-vaccination-for-kids-only-after-nod-to-covaxin/articleshow/87594771.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||India||On pre-poll Kairana visit, Yogi attacks 'Talibani' mindset||LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s visits to Kairana in Shamli and Rampur on Monday marked the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) strategy of putting its saffron mascot on the front for escalating the political spadework in the restive west UP region ahead of the assembly elections. The visits are crucial as Kairana was at the centre stage during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections after BJP had ratcheted up the issue of Hindu exodus following the 2013 Muzaffarnagar communal riots, while Rampur is the bastion of Samajwadi Party (SP) MP Azam Khan. The chief minister said in Kairana that those with “Talibani mindset will not be tolerated in Uttar Pradesh”. Referring to the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots and the Kairana “exodus”, he added, “the criminals who had forced Kairana businessmen to flee their homes are themselves compelled to follow the exodus process now.” Informed party sources said Yogi is likely to visit Mathura, Meerut and Saharanpur in quick succession in the next few days. In Mathura, on November 10, Yogi will inaugurate the ‘Braj Raj Utsav’ which is being organised by Braj Teerth Vikas Board. On November 11, the CM will felicitate Paralympics sportspersons from across the state in Meerut. Plans are also afoot for CM’s visit to Saharanpur where he will lay the foundation stone of the Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) centre in Deoband. The state government had in August green flagged the project, which entails setting up a commando centre over 2,000 sq mt. The move had come under sharp criticism as the opposition termed it a ‘polarisation bid’ of the BJP government. UP BJP organisation secretary and in charge of Saharanpur, Chandra Mohan said the development of west UP has been high on CM Yogi’s agenda. “His visits to the region will speed up the ongoing development projects being carried out by the state government,” he said. Yogi’s move to step up campaign in west UP also gains pertinence in the backdrop of farmers’ continuing protest against the new farm laws. The Lakhimpur violence in which eight persons, including four protesting farmers, were killed had further stoked political frenzy in the region having a sizeable presence of Dalits and Muslims. The development also draws a noticeable contrast from the politically crucial east UP region that has been hogging the spotlight amid the opposition’s concerted attempts for gaining a foothold in PM Narendra Modi’s constituency Varanasi and CM Yogi’s political backyard Gorakhpur. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav is planning to set the political temperature soaring by kicking off the third phase of his ‘Vijay Yatra’ from Gorakhpur on November 13. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has already visited Varanasi and Gorakhpur and addressed rallies. BJP too is digging in its heels in east UP where Union home minister Amit Shah will lay the foundation stone of a university in Azamgarh, the parliamentary constituency of Akhilesh, on November 13. The inauguration of the 341km Purvanchal Expressway connecting Lucknow with Ghazipur by PM Narendra Modi at Sultanpur on November 16 would further reinforce BJP’s development narrative ahead of polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/on-pre-poll-kairana-visit-yogi-attacks-talibani-mindset/articleshow/87594851.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Early marriages to quitting studies, kids share pandemic woes||BENGALURU: Aradhana M, a I PU student from a college in Ulsoor, left her audience spellbound as she spoke about the problems plaguing children during the pandemic. “We were in Std 10 when classes went online. So many of my peers lost interest in studies and were depressed. Now, we are all worried what our future will be like,” the CV Raman Nagar resident said. Aradhana was spotlighting the issues in front of top government officials at the launch of a series — Public Hearing of Children — a joint initiative of UNICEF and the Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (KSCPCR), organised on Monday. She was one of the 40 students picked from across the state to speak about the challenges faced by them during the pandemic. “...Many students highlighted the issue of child marriage in areas like Sanjay Gandhi Nagar, Rajiv Gandhi Nagar and Hosanagar. In fact, in Hosanagar, there are three plans of child marriages,” the youngster said, adding that several of her peers have dropped out of school and are working, while many others have taken to anti-social activities. Aradhana said that there are instances of boys, who have dropped out of schools, harassing and teasing girls. “Girls cannot even complain about it as their parents will only prevent them from going to school,” she said. Aradhana requested the authorities concerned to ensure that religion is kept away from schools. Another grade 10 student, Veeresh, said rainwater seeps into their house in a slum in Akshaynagar and wreaks havoc. “There are neither roads, nor drinking water,” he said. A hearing-impaired student, Diwakar, said that disabled children are isolated and the same has only increased due to the pandemic. Uma Mahadevan, principal secretary to government, department of women and child development, empowerment of differently abled and welfare of senior citizens, responded to the children and encouraged them to continue speaking out fearlessly. “The pandemic had a devastating impact on children, but the government has taken measures to help them. For instance, the Sethubandha Programme to help students re-enter schools. While child marriage is void in the state, we are seeing an increase in the number of such cases being reported, which also means greater awareness,” Uma said. Sonykutty George, child protection specialist, UNICEF, said demands and concerns of these children must get enough space in policy matters. Chairpersons and members of state commission for protection of child rights of four states – Karnataka, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Goa – shared their best practices at the event. Anthony Sebastian O Praem, chairperson, KSCPCR said the commission launched Kare App – online grievance registration system — and also gave timely recommendations on various issues to the government. Niranjanaradhya VP, development educationist, mentor of school development and monitoring committees and chief advocate for public education, who facilitated the discussion, said that these commissions aid in proactive engagement with the state. While the Telangana commission had help desks and transit homes for children whose parents were affected by Covid, Tamil Nadu created awareness among people about various issues via social media platforms. Goa’s commission tackled cyber safety issues, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/early-marriages-to-quitting-studies-kids-share-pandemic-woes/articleshow/87594870.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Pre-primary classes open to thin turnout on Day 1, teachers hopeful||BENGALURU: Tenmozhi Tamil, a three-and-a-half-year-old, was excited as she walked into an anganwadi at Subbaiahnapalya in Banaswadi on Monday. After all it was Day 1 of reopening of pre-primary classes — anganwadis, standalone preschools and LKG and UKG of K10 schools — across the state. Tenmozhi’s classroom was full of balloons and coloured paper. The teacher was warm and loving. The girl made two new friends after she walked in. Two more joined later. Stories were told, songs were sung and pictures had to be drawn. The only sad part was that the kids were very few. The response on the first day of resumption of pre-primary classes in most institutions in the city was cold. Many anganwadis saw only a handful of children. “Six of the 22 children attended class. We informed parents about the reopening, called them on phone and even visited some homes. But many parents said their second vaccine dose is due in a month’s time. They want to finish that and then send the children. However, the attendance is bound to improve,” said Rekha, the anganwadi teacher at Subbaiahnapalya. “The numbers in the city may have been low, but institutions in rural areas saw a good response. Anganwadi workers and parents were a happy lot. Initial hesitancy is expected. The numbers will pick up in the days to come,” said Uma Mahadevan, principal secretary, department of women and child development. For budget schools, admissions have been really low for kindergarten classes. “Admissions were only 5%-10% of the normal times. Of the students who have enrolled, some turned up. Even though the numbers were small, many schools resumed classes. They did not want the children to lose out any more. Some parents were happy and others worried, and the schools addressed their concerns,” said D Shashi Kumar, secretary of Association of Primary and Secondary Schools of Karnataka. Several stand alone preschools did not restart on Monday. As reported by TOI, most preschools had shifted their goods to godowns last year and have only begun work on setting them up again. “The announcement came too late. Many preschools without their own premises could not prepare in time. Those with their own premises started and the turnout was encouraging. Some of them saw decent attendance. We are sure parents will realise the importance of sending children to schools and admissions will also pick up,” said Pruthvi Banwasi, secretary, Karnataka Council of Pre-schools. For those who came to school, it was a grand welcome. A large number of private schools also started primary classes on Monday after Deepavali holidays. “I had maths, Kannada and sports lessons. I made two friends, Naira and Siri, and want more,” said an excited Sumedha Anand, 6, student of a Jayanagar school. In another part of the city, three-year-old Bhuvan was carrying a school bag half his size and asking his grandmother to take him into the classroom quickly. “He is tired of online classes. He has seen his teacher in virtual sessions and is prepared to enter the classroom,” said his grandmother Lakshmi at Child’s Play Montessori School, Hoysala Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/pre-primary-classes-open-to-thin-turnout-on-day-1-teachers-hopeful/articleshow/87594872.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Hacker Sriki’s bail orders reserved for today||BENGALURU: A local court on Monday reserved its orders on the bail petition filed by alleged hacker Srikrishna Ramesh alias Sriki, 26, for Tuesday. It, however, sent Sriki’s friend Vishnu Bhat to police custody for three days. Sriki and Bhat were arrested on Saturday night after a brawl in a star hotel in Domlur. Later, they tested positive for consumption of ganja. Police booked them for the brawl as well as under section 27 of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (punishment for consumption of any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance). Initially, cops sought six days’ custody of Bhat, arguing they had recovered at least 10 cigarettes filled with ganja from his Indiranagar residence and they needed to question him over the source. “We did not seek custody of Sriki as we did not seize any drugs from him. Accordingly, he applied for bail,” a senior police officer said. Bhat had visited the hotel on Old Airport Road to see Sriki. He allegedly attacked its staff when they objected to him entering the lobby on the fourth floor without recording his details in the register. Alerted by hotel staff, jurisdictional police from Jeevan Bima Nagar station rushed to the spot.Finding their behaviour strange, cops subjected them to medical test and found them positive for ganja. Sriki was arrested in November 2020 on drug-peddling charges and then on charges of hacking websites. In January 2021, CID took him into custody for questioning him over his alleged involvement in the case of hacking into the state government’s e-procurement portal. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/srikis-bail-orders-reserved-for-today/articleshow/87594875.cms||---

The maximum temperature dropped from 28 degrees Celsius on November 4 to 24.5 degrees C on November 8. However, minimum temperature has remained steady at 19 degrees Celsius over the past four days. An official from India Meteorological Department (IMD) said, “Winter will not completely set in if the city continues to receive rainfall. The sky needs to be clear for the temperature to dip even further.” With the day temperature dropping, the city on Monday woke up to a pleasantly misty and foggy morning for the third consecutive day. The IMD official said, “Mist or fog is very common during winter. The density of the same will increase as winter completely sets in over the city and Bengalureans will continue to wake up to fog or mist till March.” However, no flights taking off from Kempegowda International Airport were delayed due to fog. There was widespread rain across the state on Monday but all stations reported only light showers. The depression over east central Arabian sea is moving west, north-westwards, while there is also a cyclonic circulation over southeast Bay of Bengal adjoining South Andaman Sea extending up to 5.8km above mean sea level. Under this influence, a low pressure area is likely to form over southeast Bay of Bengal in the next 24 hours and expected to move west, south-westwards. South interior Karnataka, coastal Karnataka and north interior Karnataka are likely to receive widespread rainfall till Friday. Between June and September, Bengaluru saw 582.4mm of rainfall and from September till November 8, the figure is 439.3mm. This October, the city recorded 366.5mm of rainfall against the normal of 170.6mm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/maximum-temperature-dips-but-rain-may-halt-slide/articleshow/87594874.cms||---

B Vijendra, chief health officer, BBMP blamed the prevalence of the virus in the four wards on the migrant population and poor testing at railway and bus stations. “We are controlling Covid-19 spread to a great extent, but the migrant population continues to affect us,” he said. There are two kinds of migrant population — IT professionals and students, and those belonging to lower-income groups. “According to our study, we noticed the majority of Covid-19 cases is among migrants from lower-income groups. These people are returning from their villages and towns to resume work,” said Vijendra. The civic agency is following stringent measures to control the spread of Covid-19 and is testing every new entrant in the wards. “We have informed ASHA workers to keep strict vigil in wards allocated to them. Once they come across someone showing Covid symptoms, they immediately send him or her into isolation and start contact-tracing,” he said. As these people live in closed spaces, chances of the virus spreading from them are very high. Poor testing at border check posts is also a matter of concern. “Many of these people wouldn’t have taken their vaccination shot or got their RT-PCR report. To avoid getting tested, they veer off highways and use smaller roads to enter the city. These are the kind of people adding to the cases,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/4-wards-account-for-citys-covid-burden/articleshow/87594879.cms||Nithya Mandyam

Nethra arrived at nearby Madanayakanahalli station, off Tumakuru Road, at midnight and told police she had killed Palar Swamy aka Swamy Raj, 50. Raj, a real estate businessman, was sexually harassing her and she killed him as things turned unbearable, she claimed. Police immediately arrested Nethra, even as a team rushed to her house. However, Basavaraju M, father of Raj, lodged a complaint with police, alleging that Nethra wanted to grab all the property earned by him and his son. According to him, Raj married TR Satyakumari 25 years ago and they had two children, including a daughter. Later he got acquainted with Nethra, a beautician, and married her six years ago. “My son used to visit me and complain about Nethra. She was harassing him for the last one year. Raj came to my house at 9.30am and complained about some health issues and left. I called him at 11pm, but he did not respond. I rushed to his residence and found my son lying in a pool of blood. He had severe head injuries. Nethra was holding an iron rod and fled the spot soon after I entered the house,” Basavaraju stated in his complaint. Satyakumari alleged that Nethra murdered Raj to take possession of his property.  Raj had developed a layout in two acres belonging to Nagesh in Harokyatanahalli. Later, he returned the property to Nagesh keeping six sites with him. Three years ago, Raj built a posh house in these sites and lived there with Nethra. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/wife-bludgeons-businessman-to-death-surrenders-before-police/articleshow/87594880.cms||---

But Liu won a close third game to seize the advantage before prevailing 11-9 in the next game to close out the final.Yashaswini had a comparatively easy passage to the title round, defeating Singapore’s Ser Lin Qian 11-9, 11-3, 11-7 in the semifinals. Her toughest match in the category was in the pre-quarterfinals, where she rallied to oust Zuzanna Wielgos 3-2 after being down 1-2 at one point.Playing in sub-zero temperatures wasn’t easy as the Bengaluru girl, feeling a bit under the weather, lost the U-19 semifinal to the eventual champion, Australia's Liu Yangzi, 8-11, 4-11, 11-6, 7-11 on Sunday.“Last week was hectic for Yashaswini. She played in three finals, averaging at least six matches every day, with hardly any time between age group schedules or tournaments. A day after she completed her matches in Senec, she was in Hungary where she reached the U-17 final and the U-19 semifinal,” her coach Anshuman Roy said.The U-19 bronze at Szombathely upped Yashaswini’s medal count to four in a week, a rich haul from two tournaments in Slovakia and Hungary.She had started the week with a gold in the U-17 singles at the WTT Youth Contender Senec last Tuesday before claiming the bronze in the U-19 singles a day later.Results: WTT Youth Contender Szombathely (Hungary): U-17: Final: Yashaswini Ghorpade lost to Zhou Jingyi (Sin) 7-11, 11-8, 10-12, 9-11.

---||India||Unhappy with Lakhimpur Kheri probe, SC wants monitoring by retired judge||NEW DELHI: Dissatisfied with the ongoing probe by the UP Police special investigation team into the October 3 Lakhimpur Kheri violence, the Supreme Court Monday said it must be be monitored by a retired high court judge from another state to infuse “impartiality, independence and fairness”. Indicating the SC would no longer monitor the probe that “is not going the way we expected”, CJI N V Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli suggested two names — Justices Ranjit Singh and Rakesh Kumar Jain, both former judges of the Punjab and Haryana HC — and asked the UP government to choose one to be appointed for monitoring the investigation till filing of separate chargesheets in three incidents: the mowing down of four farmers, lynching of three political workers accused in the first incident and the murder of a journalist. Appearing for the UP government, Harish Salve assured the court the appointment would be done and approval would be conveyed to it by Friday, the date of next hearing. When a widow of a man allegedly lynched by the crowd sought CBI investigation claiming that state police too was involved in the lynching, the bench said, “CBI is not the solution to every problem. We are being careful. We are not going to give the case to the CBI. We want to protect the evidence that has been collected.” “Let some independent judge monitor (the investigations) till the chargesheets are filed. Monitoring is required because in the case of death of an innocent journalist, the cause of death was different from what was sought to be projected. We do not want to add any political overtones to the incident. Let an independent retired judge monitor. We need not hear the matter and monitor everything. We are taking care that proper investigation takes place into the incident without bias. For that reason we are thinking of monitoring by a retired judge, so that without any bias, the investigation can be completed... We are trying to infuse some independence, impartiality and fairness into the investigation,” the bench said. Right at the beginning of the hearing after a gap of 10 days, the bench said, “We have seen the status report. There is nothing in that status report except saying some more witnesses have been examined. That’s all. We had granted 10 days’ time to the state. Even the forensic lab reports have not come.” When Salve said that the lab reports will come on November 15 and that it was beyond the control of the SIT, which has been following up regularly, the CJI-led bench said, “It (the investigation) is not going the way we expected. What about the other issues? Only (main accused in farmers’ murder case) Ashish Mishra’s phone has been seized. What about the other 12 arrested accused? You have not seized their phones or other electronic equipment from them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/unhappy-with-lakhimpur-kheri-probe-sc-wants-monitoring-by-retired-judge/articleshow/87594968.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Delhi||Delhi riots: Statements of 3 protected witnesses were cooked up by cops, says Umar Khalid||NEW DELHI: Former JNU student leader Umar Khalid alleged before a city court on Monday that statements of the witnesses in a northeast Delhi riots case, in which he was booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, were written by someone else and given to them as police did not have any evidence against him. Khalid’s counsel further claimed that the statements of three protected witnesses were “cooked up” by police. The submissions were made before additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat during hearing of Khalid’s bail plea in the case. Reading out a statement of one of the protected witnesses, senior advocate Trideep Pais, appearing for Khalid, said it was clear he served tea in the meetings, but he knew the names of all the people who were not even in the meetings. “He is the only witness who says that the meeting was secret. All other witnesses do not claim this. They all contradict each other… How can a person speak in front of a chaiwala and spill the beans of a conspiracy? The witness waits from January to June and appears miraculously before police. Clearly a cooked-up witness,” Pais alleged. “He said Natasha Narwal was present but she was not there. Should you believe this man? … You [Police] can’t have half-truths to go and make a case against me. Clearly, these statements are written by someone else, given to these people to pass them off as theirs because you don't have any evidence. So, you call people to the police station and tell them that I want to implicate so and so,” the senior counsel argued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/khalid-statements-of-3-protected-witnesses-were-cooked-up-by-cops/articleshow/87593899.cms||Usha Das
---||Ahmedabad||Gandhinagar: Man arrested for raping 3 minors, killing one of victims||AHMEDABAD: A depraved sex offender, who had terrorized Gandhinagar by raping three minor girls and killing one of them in the past 10 days, has finally been arrested. Nearly 100 Gandhinagar cops set aside Diwali festivities to track down and nab accused Vijay Thakor, a 26-year-old resident of Vansjada village in Kalol taluka, on Sunday. “Thakor has confessed to raping girls aged 5 and 7 years. He also abducted and killed a three-year-old before raping the corpse. He has been remanded in police custody till November 11 for further investigation,” Abhay Chudasama, Inspector General of Police (Gandhinagar range), said on Monday. Thakor – a labourer with a private firm in Santej – is married and has a six-year-old daughter, said police. “Addicted to porn after his wife became pregnant a second time, he hunted for minor girls as he believed they would be unable to narrate his sexual preying on them to anyone, leaving him safe,” police said. Police received the first complaint on November 4. A woman labourer living near Rancharda village approached Santej police, alleging that an unidentified man had abducted her five-year-old daughter and left her at a secluded place. “The girl’s medical check-up confirmed that she had been raped,” said Chudasama. Two days later, Santej police received a similar complaint from a casual labourer, who hails from Dahod. He told police that his three-year-old daughter had been kidnapped on the night of November 5 from their makeshift shanty near Khatraj crossroads. “After watching hundreds of CCTV footage and collecting information from locals, seven teams of Gandhinagar police including personnel from the local crime branch, special operations groups, and Santej police station, zeroed in on Thakor,” said Chudasama. He added, “Thakor had lured the five-year-old victim by offering to buy her new clothes. In the second case, he entered the hut when everyone was asleep and abducted the child. Thakor killed the three-year-old because she cried for help loudly. He then raped her body and dumped it in a culvert near Moti Bhoyan village in Gandhinagar.” The body has been recovered by the police. “During interrogation, Thakor confessed to have raped a seven-year-old girl, whose parents are labourers, around 10 days ago. He said he snatched her mobile phone, forcing her to follow him. He took her to a secluded spot and raped her,” said the IGP. A detailed investigation about Thakor’s criminal past is on, said police.

This is a drop of six positions from the third rank in Leads 2019. Minister of commerce and industry, consumer affairs, food and public distribution and textiles, Piyush Goyal, released the report in New Delhi on Monday. As per the report, Andhra Pradesh registered its biggest fall in ranking on account of issues across infrastructure, services and the regulatory environment. The state has scored low in indicators of quality of infrastructure. Interactions with stakeholders have also brought to the fore infrastructure-related challenges in the state. For instance, condition of the road stretch from Vijayawada to Visakhapatnam via Rajahmundry and the stretch from Visakhapatnam port to warehouses along the national highway need attention. The shortage of warehousing facilities, specifically in Vijayawada, Kakinada and in parts of Nellore and the general lack of regulation for setting up a warehousing facility in the state are some other negative factors highlighted in industry interactions. A similar sentiment is also reflected in the below average scores of the state in the extent of facilitation and ease of obtaining approvals. As per the report, stakeholders have pointed out that high toll costs and additional levy on diesel are two elements that have resulted in high cost of logistics in the state. The stakeholder perception score has hence been low on related indicators of reasonableness of road freight rates and prices of terminal services. “Andhra Pradesh needs to proactively plan to tackle challenges highlighted by the logistics industry stakeholders. Robust institutional mechanism and policy framework along with infrastructure augmentation can help the state enable the logistics sector to maximise its potential. In addition, available infrastructure needs to be upgraded in respect of road and rail connectivity,” read the report. The Leads survey 2021 was conducted between May and August 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/from-3rd-to-9th-spot-ap-no-longer-leads-logistics-charts/articleshow/87598555.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The three MLC posts fell vacant in May 2021, but the election was deferred due to Covid-19. The election was necessitated by the retirement of ruling YSR Congress member Devasani Chinna Govinda Reddy, TDP member M A Shariff and BJP state unit president Somu Veerraju. All three posts will go to the ruling YSR Congress as it has an absolute majority in the legislative assembly. The TDP and the BJP are set to lose their strength in the upper house with this election. Given the strength of the parties in the assembly, the YSR Congress would wrest the three posts unanimously. Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy is set to clear the candidatures for the three posts. Jagan Mohan Reddy had promised MLC posts to several sections of the people during his padayatra ahead of the 2019 general elections. One of these sections is the Viswabrahmin community in Machilipatnam. The ruling party has in hand another 11 MLC posts that will be elected by the local bodies. The state had conducted the municipal and zilla parishad elections recently and 11 posts are vacant in the House now, which are to be filled in the next one month. Besides, the ruling party will also have to fill the posts of legislative council chairman and vice-chairman. The chief minister is expected to nominate the candidates accordingly, taking all social equations into consideration. The YSR Congress had followed social and gender equations in filling municipal and zilla parishad chairperson and vice-chairperson posts in the recent past, as well as posts in various corporations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ec-notification-for-mlc-polls-today/articleshow/87592853.cms||Gopi Dara

The federation said the AP government has not paid bills for the past four months and it is not possible for it to continue supplies if dues are not cleared. Federation managing director and chief operating officer BC Satish in a letter to the chief secretary said several milk societies in Karnataka are struggling due to non-payment of dues. Satish said KMF has also decided to increase the price by Rs 5 per litre with immediate effect. He said KMF agreed to supply milk to AP at a discount of Rs 5 per litre keeping in mind that supplies were intended for women and children at anganwadi centres. The AP government signed an MoU with KMF for supply of milk to anganwadi centres in June 2020 under Sampoorna Poshan scheme. AP procures nearly 110 lakh litres per month from KMF. Satish added they are unable to supply milk at the old rates due to increase in petrol and diesel prices, which has resulted in a huge burden on the federation in the form of transportation charges. The KMF MD said they had communicated their decision to cancel the Rs 5 per litre discount in February. Satish pointed out that many of the societies are struggling with losses due to increased input costs and fuel charges. Responding to the issue, women development and child welfare minister Taneti Vanitha said the issue will be resolved shortly. “We will take the issue to the notice of the chief minister and ensure that supplies are continued without any trouble,” Vanitha told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/cant-supply-milk-if-dues-pending-kmf/articleshow/87592865.cms||Samdani MN

The government had earlier told the high court that it will pay the pending bills by November 8. Arguing on behalf of the companies, senior counsels Basava Prabhu Patil, Sanjay Sen and Sajan Poovaya told the court that because of non-payment of bills by the government, the companies are facing insolvency threat from financial institutions, and are not able to service the debt or pay salaries. The government pleader, representing the discoms, told the court that they are in the process of pooling funds to pay the bills and sought time till November 24. The high court expressed displeasure over the reply for not complying with the court’s orders. The bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra and Justice Lalitha Kanneganti said the government cannot take the high court’s orders in a casual manner by claiming that it is not having funds to pay bills like any other private business house. Granting three weeks to clear the bills, the court said it will direct the government to submit securities to the court if the deadline is not met this time. The renewable energy companies moved appeal petitions challenging the single judge orders of going to Electricity Regulatory Commision for tariff negotiations. They also challenged the interim arrangement for payment of bills at Rs 2.43 per unit for wind power and Rs 2.44 per unit for solar power. However, as the bills are not being paid as per the interim arrangement, they moved interlocutory applications seeking directions to the government to clear bills.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/clear-power-cos-bills-in-3-weeks/articleshow/87592819.cms||Srikanth Aluri

District magistrate Chandrashekhar Singh had directed the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna Medical College and Hospital and Nalanda Medical College and Hospital to keep their emergency services and operation theatres open during the festival. Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari said six temporary hospitals have been set up at Bans Ghat, Collectorate Ghat, Law College Ghat, Gai Ghat, Patipul Ghat and gate number 93 with beds, stretchers, oxygen administration system, essential life-saving medicines and other necessary medical facilities. “Over 90 teams of doctors and paramedics have been deputed at these ghats,” Dr Vibha said, adding that minor health issues would be effectively treated by the medical teams while in serious cases the patients would be taken to the nearest hospital. Meanwhile, major private hospitals and nursing homes of the city have been asked to offer medical help and ambulance service during the festival. PMCH superintendent Dr I S Thakur said all the heads of departments were directed to remain on alert and keep their operation theatres ready. “Direction has been issued to keep 20 beds each in medical and surgical emergency ready”, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/six-temporary-hospitals-set-up-at-ganga-ghats/articleshow/87592668.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Patna||Thousands throng ghats as 4-day Chhath festival begins||PATNA: Thousands of devotees dressed in colourful attire thronged different ghats here as the four-day Chhath festival began with ‘nahay-khay’ on Monday. The Ganga ghats reverberated with devotional chants and melodious folk songs that created a soothing and vibrant ambience since morning. Chhath vratis and their family members took dips in the holy water of the Ganga to wash away their sins, cleaned their houses and utensils with the Ganga water and cooked prasad like rice, chana dal and bottle gourd on ‘nahay-khay’. As per the belief, the vratis consume this prasad to purify the body before the actual rituals and 36-hour-long fast. The devotees were seen fetching water in brass pots at Gandhi Ghat where maximum footfall was registered on Monday. Devotees, mostly married women singing devotional songs dedicated to Sun Lord, were seen drying wheat and rice for ‘kharna’ prasad at the ghats. Soni Devi (43), a resident of Prithviraj Path, said after bath and prayer, she cooks prasad on earthen stove using dry mango woods. “I have bought all the materials at ghat. We could not perform the rituals at the ghat last year due to Covid restrictions,” she said. Rama Sahay, another devotee who was accompanied by her husband, daughter and sister-in-law at Digha Ghat, said she has been observing fast during Chhath for the past 12 years. “It is the festival when all the family members gather and help each other to perform rituals,” she said. Ragini Kashyap, a devotee at Kali Ghat, said, “I use the Ganga water to prepare prasad. The fasting begins after eating kaddu and rice. Now, I will eat only kheer on kharna,” she said. Several devotees hailed the arrangements made at the ghats by the district administration. Kamalkant Singh, a resident of Arya Kumar Road, said the arrangements were better than previous year at the Law College Ghat. “The ghat is much cleaner and there are several changing rooms and urinals apart from the drinking water facilities. My wife, Deepali, observes the fast and I also join her in offering arghya,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/thousands-throng-ghats-as-4-day-chhath-festival-begins/articleshow/87592592.cms||Faryal Rumi

The changeover to the shorter cycle will be in a phased manner, starting with stocks with lowest market capitalisation moving in before those with higher market value, according to a joint release from the NSE, the BSE and other market intermediaries. Currently, the market follows a T+2 system for all stocks in the cash segment. Under the T+2 system, a buyer gets the shares that he bought in his demat account on the third working day, including the day of trade. Similarly, a seller receives the money for selling his shares on the third working day. Under the T+1 system, stocks and money will be credited by next evening which will give investors the option to trade more by rolling the funds and shares faster. The move to a T+1 system will be made nearly 19 years after the Indian market had moved to the T+2 settlement cycle from T+3 cycle. Currently, most markets around the world follow the T+2 system, but technological advancements are pushing bourses to shorten the settlement cycles. On September 7 this year, despite strong resistance from some sections of market players, Sebi had decided to move to the T+1 cycle. The rule that decides which stocks will move to the T+1 cycle, and in what order, will first rank all the listed stocks according to their market capitalisation. The last 100 in this list will move to T+1 cycle first on February 25, 2022. Thereafter, on every last Friday of the month, the next bottom 500 stocks will be added to the list, the release said. As things stand now, lesser-known stocks like Steel Strips and Coromandel Agro Products will enter the T+1 cycle in the first batch, a list release by the bourses showed. On the other hand, blue-chips like Reliance Industries, TCS and HDFC Bank will move to the shorter trading & settlement cycle in the last (12th) batch on January 27, 2023. Listed instruments like closed-ended mutual fund schemes, debt securities including corporate bonds, sovereign gold bonds, government securities, treasury bills, state development loans, REITs, InvITs, ETFs, IDRs, etc, will also be moved to the new system from January 27, 2023. The release further said that the newly listed stocks will have a 30-day cooling period before being added to the list. Preference shares, warrants, right entitlements, DVRs, etc, will be added to the list along with the parent company’s stock. On September 7, Sebi had asked all the market infrastructure institutions (MIIs) to take necessary steps to put in place proper systems and procedures for the smooth introduction of the T+1 settlement cycle. MIIs, which are on track to put all the necessary processes in place, on Monday said that they had set the road map for the transition to a shorter trading & settlement cycle. According to industry sources, under the T+1 cycle, tech-driven discount brokerages will be at an advantage over those that are yet to embrace technology in a big way for regular operations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/shorter-trade-cycle-in-select-stocks-to-kick-off-from-feb-25/articleshow/87593962.cms||---

News of the police action was intimated to the stock exchanges by DishTV, which said that it had been notified of this action by the office of crime branch, Gautam Buddh Nagar. It is not clear whether Yes Bank can exercise its voting rights in light of this notice. Responding to a query from TOI, a Yes Bank spokesperson said, “As a matter of policy, we don’t revert on client-specific issues and actions being taken by the bank. However, the bank is not in receipt of any such notice from any authority at this point.” The notice comes at a time when Yes Bank, which holds a 25.6% stake in DishTV, is seeking to organise a shareholder meeting to oust the current management led by Jawahar Goel and four independent directors. This is the second high-profile case where police has intervened in connection with lenders. Earlier this month, former SBI chairman Pratip Chaudhuri was arrested by Jaisalmer police for the sale of a defaulter’s assets to an asset reconstruction company. In the notice, the crime branch informed the company that it has issued it under Section 102 of the criminal procedure code, 1973, to Yes Bank restricting it from dealing in and/or exercising any rights over 44.5 crore shares of the company till completion of the investigation or till further orders. It has asked the company to ensure compliance of the order. Section 102 pertains to the power of the police to seize property that may be alleged or suspected to have been stolen, or which may be found under suspicious circumstances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/dont-exercise-dishtv-stock-rights-cops-to-yes-bank/articleshow/87593860.cms||---
---||Business||IndusInd Bank slides nearly 11% on glitch report||MUMBAI: Shares of IndusInd Bank fell by nearly 11% after the lender’s weekend statement that a “technical glitch” resulted in 84,000 loans being disbursed in its micro loan arm without customer consent. The bank had issued the statement in response to a report in The Economic Times on allegations of ever-greening of loans by the bank. In a call with analysts, the bank reiterated that there was no ever-greening of loans and, given its processes, ever-greening was difficult. The bank disburses micro loans through its subsidiary Bharat Financial. A report by Motilal Financial Services after the management call said that the RBI’s review is under way, while it has also suggested an external audit to provide further comfort. A research report by Emkay said, “The management claims that all the loans follow a weekly repayment model and any instance of default is recorded as a missed instalment. In view of the weekly repayment model, ever-greening is difficult. IndusInd Bank has a practice of giving top-up loans, but it never allows two core loans to run simultaneously.” Besides the concerns over the loans sanctioned without consent, there have been rumours about resignations in Bharat Financial. In response to queries on news reports that Bharat Finance CEO Shalabh Saxena is moving to Spandana Sphoorty, the management said that the bank has not received any resignations. The bank said that M R Rao, non-executive chairman of BFIL, who resigned in September 2021, has been retained as an adviser with IndusInd Bank. The bank management also said that it had a succession plan in place to maintain the continuity of business across verticals. The Emkay Finance report said that the bank could have done better in terms of communicating about management changes in BFIL and about the technical glitch in the MFI book, which led to allegations of ever-greening in the MFI book (which otherwise has always been an area of suspicion). “We believe that the bank’s turnaround story remains intact, but it needs to work more on strengthening credit underwriting/risk management and communication with stakeholders to sustain the long-term rerating,” the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/indusind-bank-slides-nearly-11-on-glitch-report/articleshow/87593883.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Pandemic effect? Naga Pratishta puja now costs a bomb in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: A Naga Pratishta puja to ward off negative influences is likely to cost you a bomb this Karthika season. Even small temples in the city are charging anywhere between Rs 60,000-70,000 for Naga Pratishta puja as the demand has peaked with many wanting to leave behind personal and financial losses following the Covid pandemic. “It is the best remedy for those finding it difficult to get married, troubles in marriage, not having children, work issues. But we recommend this based on charts of individuals,” said Piduru Rajasekhara Sharma, a city-based astrologer. “I did not have the money or time to visit famous temples. So, I was searching for this puja in the city. To my shock, some priests demanded Rs 60,000,” said Sarat Kasani, a software professional facing job issues. According to Sharma, the puja is performed where Shiva is one of the deities and takes 3-5 hours. The snake god’s idols have to be installed and the priest or the person getting it done has to ensure that puja is offered daily. “It is seen as a very complex process and not many temples prefer having snake idols installed by devotees. So the charges are high,” another astrologer said. The famed Srikalahasti Temple began offering this puja in 2017 for about Rs 15,000. “But in small temples, it takes more than Rs 50,000. Very few temples offer this puja for less,” said M Mallikharjun, a pandit. Temple authorities said the demand was high during the auspicious Karthika season, especially on festive days such as Nag Chaviti. A manager of Shiva temple in Chaitanyapuri said, “We have full bookings. But we had to turn away many as our temple is very small.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/naga-puja-to-ward-off-evil-eye-costs-a-bomb-in-city/articleshow/87593872.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Business||Business correspondents fleece PSU banks: Study||MUMBAI: A study published by the State Bank of India (SBI) has said that business correspondents, who are channels for most Jan Dhan account transactions, are overcharging public sector banks (PSBs) by routing transactions in a manner aimed at maximising fees. The report has called for changes in norms for business correspondents to promote financial inclusion. Business correspondents connect to banking systems using handheld devices that are similar to credit card-swipe machines. These machines are capable of using Aadhaar biometric or debit cards for authorisation. If the business correspondent provides service to customers of a bank using an application of the same bank, the transaction is considered as an ‘on us’ transaction by the bank. If the service is provided to a customer using an application of another bank, the transaction becomes an ‘off us’ for the bank where the customer holds their account and the bank ends up paying an interchange fee. The report, authored by SBI group’s chief economic adviser Soumya Kanti Ghosh, has called upon the RBI to disincentivise business correspondents who are converting ‘on us’ transactions of public sector banks into ‘off us’ ones on the Aadhaar-enabled Payment System (AePS) to earn interchange fee and more commission. Business correspondents have taken centre stage in rural banking after the RBI’s new branch authorisation policy of 2017 recognised them as providing service for a minimum of four hours a day for five days a week as banking outlets. Their number has risen from 34,000 in 2010 to 12.4 lakh in December 2020. They have been the cornerstone of servicing the 43.7 crore Jan Dhan accounts, 78% of which are with public sector banks. According to the report, the problem lies in the flexibility given to business correspondents concerning interoperability of transactions, which has allowed them to game the system. “We estimate that the PSBs could be paying Rs 600-700 crore per annum as interchange fee. This money could be used by PSBs to further financial inclusion more holistically,” said Ghosh. The report has suggested that the AePS should work like the point-of-sale (PoS) terminal used by merchants. Converse to what is happening among business correspondents, in PoS machines the acquiring bank pays a fee to the issuing bank. “Alternatively, there could be rationalisation in interchange fee as there is no level playing field in infrastructure provided by all banks,” the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/business-correspondents-fleece-psu-banks-study/articleshow/87593902.cms||---

Talking to mediapersons after inspecting the Chhath ghats here, the CM said he was hugely satisfied with the preparations. “People engaged in preparation of Chhath ghats have laboured hard. The dangerous ghats have been barricaded. Whatever works had to be done as a precautionary measure at the ghats have been done,” Nitish said. It was the CM’s third inspection of Chhath ghats in a fortnight. Earlier, he had inspected the ghats on October 27 and November 3, and issued a series of instructions to the officials of the Patna district administration. The CM boarded a steamer boat at Nasriganj Ghat in Danapur area and began inspection of different Chhath ghats. Accompanied by deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad, education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary, health minister Mangal Pandey, former minister Nand Kishor Yadav, Patna mayor Sita Sahu and all senior officials of state administration, the CM went up to the Kangan Ghat in Patna City. During the inspection, the CM enquired from the officials about cleanliness, sanitation and arrangements of lights around the ghats, barricading of dangerous ghats, arrangement of miking, the approach roads up to the ghats, changing room for devotees, watch towers and shed for night-halt of the devotees. Nitish asked the officials to ensure that devotees and other people coming to the Chhath ghats do not face any difficulty.

The CM gave this direction after one of the visitors complained to him at his Janata darbar programme that indecent pictures and dialogues were being served to the people in the name of Bhojpuri language films and songs. “There is an urgent need of putting a check on growing indecency in the Bhojpuri language films and songs,” the visitor from Buxar urged the CM. Nitish immediately telephoned a senior officer and asked him to take necessary steps to check indecency. “His suggestion is correct. Wrong things must be checked,” the CM was heard telling the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cm-check-use-of-indecent-language-in-bhojpuri-films/articleshow/87592575.cms||---
---||Patna||President to present Padma awards to 5 from Bihar today||PATNA: Noted stage performer Ramchandra Manjhi, who excels in ‘launda naach’ which is popular among Bhojpuri-speaking people, is eagerly waiting for the moment when he will be honoured with Padma Shri, the country's fourth highest civilian award, by President Ramnath Kovind on Tuesday. Manjhi (94), a resident of Tujarpur village under Nagra block in Saran district, has reached New Delhi to receive the award at Rashtrapati Bhawan. “It is a matter of great pleasure to receive an award from the President in the presence of a galaxy of dignitaries,” he told this newspaper on Monday. Though his name for Padma Shri was announced on the occasion of Republic Day, he will be felicitated on Tuesday due to Covid pandemic. Apparently delighted, Manjhi said, “It will be an honour to the folk dance called ‘bidesiya’ in common parlance, which I have been performing since the age of 10.” He was elated over recalling his close association with his ‘guru’ late Bhikhari Thakur, better known as ‘Shakespeare of Bhojpuri’, whose live stage performances inspired Manjhi to join the troupe. “He was literally a charmer, who used to make people dance to the tunes of the Bhojpuri numbers,” Manjhi said Manjhi continued to share stage performances within the state and outside with late Bhikhari Thakur till 1971. He then worked with other artistes like Gaurishankar Thakur, Shatrughna Thakur, Dinkar Thakur, Ramdas Rahi and Prabhunath Thakur, who excelled in the 'bidesiya' form of folk dance and carried on late Bhikhari Thakur's legacy. A recipient of the Sangeet Natak Academy award, Manjhi was honoured by the state art, culture and youth department for his lifetime achievement in February this year. Manjhi is hopeful of revival of 'bidesiya’ dance after receiving Padma Shri. “I hope it will inspire the younger generation to remain associated with folk dance in a state like Bihar,” he asserted. He, however, didn’t forget to mention the name of Professor Jainendra Dost, director of Bhikhari Thakur Repertory Training and Research Centre at Chhapra, the district headquarters of Saran. Dost is a JNU scholar in performing arts. Manjhi is among the five from Bihar who will be honoured with Padma awards on Tuesday – two of them posthumously. Veteran socialist and Dalit leader late Ram Vilas Paswan has been conferred Padma Bhushan (posthumously) for his outstanding contribution in social field. Former governor of Goa Mridula Sinha (posthumously), Dulari Devi, a famous Mithila painting artist from Madhubani district and Dr Dilip Kumar Singh (medicine) are among other Padma Shri awardees to be honoured by the President on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/president-to-present-padma-awards-to-5-from-bihar-today/articleshow/87592558.cms||Ramashankar

Majority of the devotees are women prisoners. Prison authorities have provided the Chhath materials to such prisoners. They will offer ‘arghya’ in the ponds within the four walls of the prisons. They have been separated from other inmates to ensure the sanctity of the festival. Altogether 23 prisoners — 14 women and nine men — are performing Chhath at the Beur central jail. The clothes were arranged for the devotees by the jail administration. “The devotees took a holy dip in the pond on the campus on Monday,” a senior official of the Beur central jail said. The women devotees include Anjali Devi, Mamta Devi, Sulekha Devi, Abha, Panchali, Sukhiya Bind, Geeta Devi, Indu, Jyoti, Pinky, Sheela, Rimpi Kumari, Radha Devi and Sunita Devi. Jail superintendent Jitendra Kumar said male devotees have been kept in puja ward. The female devotees will prepare prasad on earthen ovens. Similarly, 60 inmates of Chanave central jail in Chhapra are performing Chhath this time. Of them, 35 are women. In Bagaha sub-jail, 21 prisoners, including 10 women, are performing the rituals.

Yadav’s inconsolable wife told mediapersons that her husband had made a video call on Sunday night and said he would come home on November 14 as he could not get leave during Diwali. “He had showed a bag in the video call that he had bought for his mother,” she added. Though Yadav belonged to Samardah village under Katya panchayat of Bihiya block in Bhojpur district, his family was currently living at Dulhinganj Bazar under the Jagdishpur block in the district. Yadav nephew Banti said, “My uncle had joined the CRPF in 2011 and Chhattisgarh was his first posting. He got married in 2006. He has three sons – Prince, Satyam and Shivam – and two daughters – Saloni and Priya.

---||Patna||Of ‘soop’ and its Chhath connection||PATNA: ‘Soop’ happens to be an important item of Chhath puja as most devotees make their offerings (arghya) to the setting and rising Sun from it. Use of soop for the offerings is in vogue right since the advent of Chhath puja itself. However, its size and material have been changing over the years. Most devotees use soops woven out of bamboo strips easily available at affordable prices everywhere, in rural as well as urban areas. Soops are also available online, supplied by several multinational companies. However, in recent times, soops made of metals are also being used by some devotees for making offerings to the sun. These soops are invariably used by women whose long-cherished wishes have been fulfilled after offering arghya to sun during Chhath. Some affluent people also offer arghya in soops made of silver or gold. The sale of soops made of gold or silver has increased considerably in the last one decade, said Binod Kumar of Raj Lakshmi Jewellers at Bakerganj. The demand for silver soops is much greater as compared to the soops made of gold, he added. Kumar pointed out that mostly these soops are only symbolic as their sizes are too small to contain any items of ‘prasad’ to be offered to the sun. “A soop of silver weighing 100gm costs Rs 6,000 while that of gold weighing just two grams cost Rs 10,000,” he said. All these soops of gold, silver and bronze or brass are made by the jewellers on order received well in advance. For quite some time past, readymade soops made of brass are coming to the city from Nepal and they are also doing good business. “According to a conservative estimate, soops made of gold and silver and brass worth Rs 4 to 5 crore are likely to be sold in Chhath puja this year,” said the jeweller. Rukmini Devi, a homemaker residing in Kankarbagh Colony, said she has been offering arghya in silver soop ever since Chhathi maiya granted her wish and blessed her with a son. But, soop made of bamboo sticks is still the most sought after item as it is within reach of even the poorest of poor devotees. “The metallic soops replaced the bamboo soops to a very limited extent and that too by the kings or jagirdars in later 19th century,” said Jayadeo Mishra, former head of Patna University’s ancient Indian history and archaeology department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/of-soop-and-its-chhath-connection/articleshow/87592662.cms||B K Mishra

---||Business||With over 3 L openings, active white collar jobs hit a 20-month high in Oct||Chennai: The white collar job market hit a 20-month high in October with active job openings crossing the three lakh mark. Hiring action is up by over 40% year-on-year from October 2020 and surpassed the October 2019 (pre- Covid) situation by almost 20% on the back of broad-based recovery in hiring extending beyond the technology sector in October. As fears of a third wave recede, and vaccinations rise, previously affected sectors like hospitality, travel, construction, manufacturing and BFSI are also opening up and likely to post more new jobs in the upcoming quarter, headhunters said. In October, the job market was up almost 30% YoY and grew approx 15% month-on-month as new age startups, fintech firms, manufacturing, and technology sectors led hiring action, Anshul Lodha, head of Page Executive India, said. “Most of the hiring is at mid to senior level in the current market,” he added. “The intent of hiring activities in Oct-Dec quarter compared to the year-ago period is being led by the multiple industries like IT, Education Services, Healthcare, FMCG, logistics, e-commerce, banks, and manufacturing indicating that the recovery is on the right track. Attrition is also an important indicator that multiple opportunities are getting created,” Amit Vadera, VP & business head — TeamLease Services, said. Specialist staffing firm Xpheno officials said that October emerged strongest with active white collar jobs at 3,20,000 for the first time in over 20 months. This represents a 12% growth over September, and 16% growth over October last year. This took the active jobs count to nearly 30% higher than the volume registered in pre-Covid months. “We haven’t hit the peak of active jobs yet as the technology industry is still driving the bulk of the demand. However, an inclusive job market is likely to return in the last quarter of this financial year when a higher vaccination rate would encourage hospitality, travel, construction, and others to open up further,” Kamal Karanth, founder, Xpheno, said. Job portal Naukri.com, in its monthly index, noted that growth in the job market surpassed pre-pandemic levels posting a 19% uptick versus the pre-pandemic period of October 2019. Naukri’s JobSpeak Index was at 2523 in October, recording 43% YoY growth from October 2020. Hiring activity has picked up in sectors like retail (up 51%) and hospitality/travel (48%) with the ongoing festive season, Naukri’s report noted. While demand for tech professionals continued to soar, the upcoming launch of 5G and related services coupled with the government’s production linked incentive scheme (PLI) boosted employment opportunities in the Telecom/ISP sector that grew by 84% in October, the job portal found in its analysis. “The rising consumer sentiment and re-opening of the workspaces triggered 5% MoM and 3% YoY gain in India Inc’s talent demand. With festive buying in full swing, retail FMCG saw a double digit growth of 23% and 19% in October vs September,” Sanjay Goyal, business head, TimesJobs and TechGig said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/with-over-3-l-openings-active-white-collar-jobs-hit-a-20-month-high-in-oct/articleshow/87593290.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

She was all praise for administrative and judicial staff of the high court who often work long hours. Expressing concern over attacks on the judiciary, Justice Lalitha said, “Aspersions are cast with a motive to intimidate judges. However, being an optimist, I look upon these as passing clouds and the majesty of the institution continues to hold its head high notwithstanding such insinuations,” she said. Justice Lalitha thanked Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra and former Chief Justices J K Maheswari and Justice A K Goswami and her fellow judges of the high court for extending their support during her tenure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-bids-farewell-to-justice-lalitha/articleshow/87592830.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Vijayawada||HC seeks details of judicial preview body||Vijayawada: The high court on Monday issued notices to the state government in the PIL petition filed challenging the Judicial Preview Act. The court asked the government to explain the need to have a parallel system to obtain legal opinion when there is already a law secretary. One Y Vidya Sagar from Tirupati moved the PIL challenging the judicial preview system introduced by the government to review tenders above Rs 100 crore. Arguing on behalf of the petitioner, D S N V Prasad Babu told the bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra and Justice Lalitha Kanneganti that the legislation is ultra vires as there is no term called judicial preview in the Constitution. The judicial preview committee is bypassing the law secretary whose job is to give legal advice to the government, he added. Special government pleader C Sumon said the judicial preview committee is an administrative issue which was set up to bring in more transparency in the tendering process. The committee will scrutinise the tender norms and deviations, if any, and will give appropriate suggestions to the government on legal, technical and financial issues, he said. When there already exists a system in the form of law secretary for advising and suggesting the government on legal matters, what was the need for bringing in a new system, the court asked. It also issued notices to the state government to place all details pertaining to the judicial preview committee, including business rules, and posted the matter for further hearing after three weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-seeks-details-of-judicial-preview-body/articleshow/87592804.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Vijayawada||HC issues notice over Brahmin corp GO||Vijayawada: The high court on Monday issued notices to the state government in the PIL petition filed challenging the GO issued to bring Brahmin Welfare Corporation (BWC) under the ambit of Backward Classes Welfare Department (BCWD). The court directed the chief secretary, principal secretary for revenue (endowments) and principal secretary for BCWD to file affidavits. One Guduru Sekhar, the official representative of Rashtriya Brahmana Sanghatan (RBS), moved the PIL challenging GO-103 issued on September 21 merging BWC into BCWD. Arguing on behalf of the petitioner, advocate Narra Srinivas told the bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra and Juctice Lalitha Kanneganti that the GO was issued without any logic and rationale. He said the BWC was originally constituted under BCWD and at the request of the latter, it was separated and brought under the revenue (endowments) department. Since then, several schemes have been implemented benefiting thousands of Brahmin youths across the state. When Brahmins are not being considered as BCs in the state, bringing BWC under BCWD is illegal and arbitrary, he argued. The court issued notices to the government directing to file affidavits and posted the matter for further hearing after three weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-issues-notice-over-brahmin-corp-go/articleshow/87592812.cms||Srikanth Aluri

On Monday, 76 Covid warriors were honoured for their tireless work in the face of insurmountable odds at a function organised by state government’s Telangana Social Impact Group (T-SIG). From individuals, NGOs to companies, these Covid warriors were involved in relief work such as arranging hospital beds, plasma, oxygen cylinders, running kitchens to supply free food, delivering medicines, helping migrant labourers with transportation and guiding government agencies align relief work. T-SIG, which is state’s initiative to channelise corporate social responsibility (CSR) work, plans to felicitate a total of 250 such warriors. Those who were not part of Monday’s function would be honoured digitally later. The function was attended by IT minister KT Rama Rao, industries and IT secretary Jayesh Ranjan, and actor/philanthropist Sonu Sood. “While it is very easy to sit in the comfort of our homes and criticise, it’s very difficult to get out and do something. This pandemic has brought out several heroes among us who came forward to take up individual social responsibility,” KTR said, citing the example of an awardee who along with his wife continued to help those in distress from his hospital bed. “The pandemic has been one crisis which none of us anticipated or could understand how it would unfold. It has been a huge challenge thrown at entire humanity,” KTR said, adding that despite the scale of the crisis, Telangana had done reasonably well. Sonu Sood said that the trail of disaster left in society after the first and second waves in the form of loss of loved ones, jobs, savings, break in education was, in fact, the third wave which had to be addressed urgently. “Our job doesn’t end here, but actually begins now,” Sood said. Citing how criticism or hesitation often discouraged many to call others to help out, the actor said, “Sometimes, we think how often can we ask a favour from someone. But we should not stop when hit by such doubts. Someone somewhere is waiting for that one call of yours. It may change everything.” Lauding the efforts of the Covid warriors, Jayesh Ranjan said that this could be the right time for the country to launch a volunteering movement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lest-we-forget-these-warriors-steppedout-as-virus-impaled-imprisoned-world/articleshow/87593890.cms||Amrita Didyala

The NMC’s project department has submitted a proposal in this regard before the standing committee which will meet on November 10. Recently, the NMC had shortlisted a private agency which has agreed to pay Rs10 crore more than the bid amount of Rs45 crore. The NMC had floated tenders to build eight floors comprising a shopping mall, restaurant and a multiplex with rooftop eatery. The mall, which was the phase-I scheme of the Orange City Street project, will be a public-private partnership project. The civic body had floated tenders in October 2019. A base price of Rs45 crore was fixed for the 35,000sqm land where the mall will come up. The NMC had finalized Praful Ved Infrastructure Company Ltd which agreed to pay Rs55.55 crore. Now, the NMC will sign an MoU with the firm. Earlier, the NMC had roped in MahaMetro for construction of the mall on December 20, 2018. MahaMetro was supposed to complete the project in 18 months but it could complete the construction only up to the plinth level. The project department has also proposed stage-wise payments to be made by the firm to the civic body. As per the proposal, within 60 days of appointment, the firm will have to pay Rs2 crore in first instalment and Rs3 crore in six months. Besides this, 14 more proposals will be tabled before the standing panel meeting to be presided over by its chairman Prakash Bhoyar. Like previous standing panel meetings, the BJP-ruled NMC has proposed to recarpet 12 tar roads and convert tar roads into cement concrete. The other proposed works include laying of sewer line worth Rs49.88 lakh in Khalasi Line in Gaddigodam, construction of retaining wall of a nullah in Shivaji Nagar under Gandhibagh zone. For the purpose, the NMC has proposed to spend Rs88.20 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-plans-to-construct-metro-mall-in-30-months/articleshow/87593888.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Chandigarh AAP affairs in-charge and MLA from Delhi, Jarnail Singh welcomed Prem Lata and her supporters and formally inducted them into the party at the party office on Monday. Prem Lata had been actively working in the Congress for the last 15 years. Party co-in-charge Pradeep Chhabra, president Prem Garg and chairman of Election Campaign Committee Chandermukhi Sharma were also present on the occasion. Former Congress vice presidents Harpreet Uppal, Ishpinder Singh, Jagtar Singh, Preetpal Kaur, Pulkit Singh and secretary Karanvir Singh also joined the party. Addressing the gathering, Jarnail Singh said the new joinings had strengthened the party in the city. Welcoming Congress leaders, the AAP leader said that after Delhi, Congress had lost its standing in Chandigarh as well. People across the country were joining AAP due to its people-friendly policies, he claimed. Jarnail Singh said that unlike the BJP and Congress, they do not make false promises to win elections. He said that the government of Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi was an example of this. He said AAP would fulfill commitments made with people, the way it had been doing in Delhi. Speaking on the occasion, Prem Lata said there was no one to take care of honest and hard-working workers in the Congress. She described the party as a “private company” and said that the responsibilities entrusted on her by AAP would be fulfilled sincerely.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/shot-in-arm-for-aap-as-former-cong-office-bearers-join-party/articleshow/87593136.cms||---

Devotees will offer “arghya” to the setting and rising sun on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. In view of the expected rush of devotees, Gaya DM Abhishek Singh has asked the officials concerned to ensure proper lighting, barricading and parking and other facilities like changing rooms and levelling of surface at the ghats. Among the ponds in and around Gaya town, Saryu pokhar has been identified as dangerous. The devotees will not be allowed to offer ‘arghya’ at Saryu pokhar. The DM has appealed to the people to go to the nearby Singra Ghat Asthan instead of Saryu pokhar to perform Chhath rituals. A congregation of around 10,000 devotees is expected at Kendui Ghat where people come from light motor vehicles from far off places. To ensure smooth passage of the devotees up to the ghat, parking arrangement has been made at Kendui ground. A control room with public address system has also been set up at Kendui ghat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/saryu-pond-in-gaya-declared-as-dangerous/articleshow/87592708.cms||---

People from Bihar living in other countries have started preparing for the community prayer service in lakes and parks as part of Chhath which began from Monday. Alok Kumar, who lives in New Jersey, said Chhath is an identity of Bihar. “We set up tent along a big lake every year and perform the Chhath rituals. This year, 30 vratis will observe the 36-hour-long fast. We will go in a group to Manalpan lake in Monroe township on November 10 to pay obeisance to Sun God. It will also be attended by the Consulate General of India in New York, Randhir Jaiswal, who is also from Bihar and knows all the rituals,” he said. Kumar said they would distribute “kharna” prasad among people on Tuesday. “This year, the weather is favourable during Chhath because the temperature mostly drops to zero degree Celsius here during this time of the year. But it is the inner emotion that gives us energy to stand in water braving cold. During the festivity, we play the traditional folk songs in the morning and the local people also enjoy it,” he added. Pallavi Singh, who has been performing Chhath for the past eight years in London’s Welwyn Garden City, said, “I observe this festival here just like how I used to do at my hometown in Patna. I keep brass utensils and pots exclusively for Chhath. We get all the puja materials in local markets, including ‘soop’ and ‘tokri’. I perform the puja at home with my husband, kids and friends.” Singh added, “We keep water in a small tub and perform all the rituals because there is no pond at our place. I perform the rituals with my friend Varsha. We also lit candles and earthen lamps on the occasion besides preparing ‘thekua’ and ‘kheer’.” Walsa Singh from Patna who lives in Washington DC said she performs the Chhath rituals at a pond near her home. “Covid pandemic forced us to perform nahay-khay and kharna rituals at home. But for offerings, we go to a nearby waterbody after taking permission from the County. Around 100 people gather to offer ‘arghya’ at the park,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/people-from-state-living-abroad-ready-to-perform-chhath-rituals/articleshow/87592675.cms||Faryal Rumi

Police said the criminals fired at the property dealer, Shiv Yadav, near the Fatuha high school around 6am. They fled on motorcycles after pumping three bullets into Yadav’s body. The injured, a resident of Mirzapur Nohta village, was rushed to the Fatuha referral hospital where he was declared brought dead. Fatuha sub-divisional police officer Rajesh Kumar Manjhi and SHO Manoj Kumar rushed to the spot and inquired about the incident. Agitated over the killing, locals blocked the road near Fatuha roundabout and disrupted vehicular traffic. They demanded immediate arrest of the culprits and compensation to the victim’s family. The traffic was restored after the intervention of senior police officers. The victim’s relatives told the police that Yadav was engaged in the real estate business for quite some time in the area. “We are investigating the case from all possible angles, including personal enmity,” the SHO told this newspaper. Meanwhile, an elderly couple identified as Suresh Singh (75) and his wife Jagtarni Devi (70) were found murdered in their house at Rampur under the Suryagarha police station area in Lakhisarai district on Monday. The couple were alone in the house. SHO of Suryagarha police station Chandan Kumar said the incident came to light when a maid reached the couple’s house early in the morning. She found the couple lying in a pool of blood. “It seems they were killed late at night. The reason behind the twin murder is yet to be ascertained,” the SHO said, adding a forensic team visited the spot and collected blood samples that will be sent to the forensic laboratory for test. Locals said Suresh Singh was a retired school teacher and staying with his wife alone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/property-dealer-in-patna-among-3-killed-in-24-hours/articleshow/87592516.cms||Ramashankar
---||Patna||Three of four CRPF jawans shot by colleague in Chhattisgarh were from Bihar||PATNA: Three of the four CRPF personnel killed in an indiscriminate firing by one of their colleagues at Lingalapalli village under Sukma district in Chhattisgarh on Monday were from Bihar. They hailed from Rohtas, Kaimur and Bhojpur districts, respectively. CRPF jawan Ritesh Kumar Ranjan, who was accused of opening fire with his AK-47 assault rifle on their colleagues at the camp, is also from Jehanabad district in Bihar. Among the three deceased, Dharmendra Singh belonged to Garua village under Sanjauli police station in Rohtas district. His wife Savita Devi said her husband had joined the central police force in 2011. Savita is currently staying at Sasaram to ensure better education of her two daughters and a son. “He had promised to visit home on the occasion of Chhath,” she said. Dharmendra had last visited his family in October this year. Another jawan who lost his life in the firing was Dhanji Singh, a resident of Evati village under Nuaw police station in Kaimur district. Dhanji had told the family that he would reach his native village on November 11, on the last day of the Chhath festival. Dhanji was married to Rupa in 2014 and the couple has two minor children. The third deceased identified as Rajmani Yadav, a native of Samardah village under Bihian block in Bhojpur district, had promised to return home on November 14. “He was supposed to visit home on the occasion of Diwali. But he could not depart for home as his leave was not granted,” said his wife Rinki Devi. Sources said Ritesh Kumar Ranjan, who has been accused of opening fire at his colleagues, is a resident of Vaina village under Ghosi block in Jehanabad district. Ranjan has been arrested by the police. His family members, however, refused to talk to the media.

However, the official residence of chief minister Nitish Kumar is all decked up for this pious festival. The CM’s close relatives will perform the Chhath rituals. Sources said CM’s nieces, sister-in-law and nephew’s wife would observe Chahth at 1, Anne Marg. “The ‘kharna’ prasad will be distributed by around 6.30pm on Tuesday,” said a source, adding ‘nahay-khay’ ritual was performed on Monday. The CM had helped his relatives perform Chhath rituals at his official residence in the past too. However, at the 10 Circular Road of Rabri, Chhath vibes were missing. Rabri had left for Delhi along with her “ailing” husband Lalu Prasad last week. Their younger son, Tejashwi Prasad, had also accompanied his parents. Rabri used to perform Chhath rituals in presence of her children in Patna earlier. However, it has been four years now since the Chhath rituals were performed by Rabri here. RJD’s state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said Rabri has skipped Chhath celebrations due to health reasons. “She used to observe Chhath with full devotion. However, her health does not allow us to perform the rituals now,” Gagan added. Following the return of Lalu to Patna last month, several RJD leaders had expected the family to celebrate Chhath here this time. However, they got dejected when Lalu left for Delhi citing poor health. Meanwhile, several netas were seen distributing puja materials among Chhath devotees on Monday. BJP’s state spokesperson Prem Ranjan Patel said all the party members were closely monitoring the cleanliness-related issues at the ghats. “Party members at local level are helping the devotees,” he added. State Congress president Madan Mohan Jha visited several ghats with other party leaders. “We will distribute necessary materials among the devotees on Tuesday,” Congress state spokesperson Rajesh Rathhore said. Chhath is also being observed at the residence of building construction minister Ashok Choudhary by his wife Neeta Keskar Choudhary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rabri-skips-chhath-again-cms-house-all-decked-up/articleshow/87592612.cms||Sheezan Nezami

But support from his friend helped him travel the rugged terrain to scale Mount Friendship, popularly known as Friendship Peak, in Himachal Pradesh. Undeterred by cold winds and freezing temperatures, two friends from Vadodara recently covered the summit at an altitude of 17,346 feet above sea level. “I am into mountaineering. I have climbed mountains in Pavagadh, Jambughoda and Chhota Udepur among others. But the Himalayas is a completely different terrain because of its snowy ranges. I could do it because of my friend,” said Sanjeev Gohil, 43, who works as a postal assistant at the Department of Posts (India Post). Gohil was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, a progressive vision disorder, in 2001. Even as he has lost 100 % vision now, he hasn’t lost passion for forest, wildlife conservation and mountaineering which he cherished before he started losing sight. “It is my passion to be in the forest and mountains. But it is because of my friends that it becomes a reality,” said Gohil. During the five-day expedition, Gohil constantly followed his civil engineer friend Pushpak Kotiya, 33, on his shoulder or with the sling attached to his bag. “The up and down movements of his shoulders helped me judge the next step I had to take. Every step is unpredictable as there are loose rocks and firm rocks. If you mistakenly step into a loose rock, you can slip as well,” said Gohil, who developed a bond with Kotiya thanks to their association with Wildlife Trust. “We had done some mountaineering but scaling Friendship Peak was a challenge because of the snowclad chilling mountains. During the climb, a traveller puts his or her foot into an existing snow step but it became all the more challenging for Sanjeev as he could not see the existing steps. For each step, he required three times more energy than others,” said Kotiya. “My dream is to conquer Mount Everest someday,” added Gohil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/visually-challenged-vadodara-man-scales-17000-ft-himalaya-peak/articleshow/87593844.cms||Prashant Rupera

Nearly 90% seats have been filled up this year as against the private-run ITIs that have struggled to fill up even 50% of total seats at the end of the admission season this year. The choice of courses offered at the government ITIs has also been a big draw for the students, principals of the institutes said. During the current admission season, over 1.11 lakh students from across the state have confirmed their seats in the centralised admission process system conducted by the state Directorate of Vocational Education and Training. Admissions in-charge for ITIs, Yogesh Patil said, “The main reason for the students to choose government ITIs is fee, quality teaching and also good placements and choice of courses. Any student applying for the ITIs would first give a choice for a government institute and if he / she does not fit the merit then they would opt for private ITIs.” In the previous year, the admissions had been hit due to the pandemic and the registrations were comparatively low. Till the fourth round, only 50 % admissions were confirmed this year. However, it picked up in the later stage and the maximum choice was given to government ITIs, Patil said. Gaurav More, a student, who has confirmed admission at the Aundh ITI, said, “I had earlier thought of doing engineering degree after completing science in FYJC. But later I changed my plan as I got admission to Aundh ITI as they have some good courses and I can start with my choice of course right from the beginning instead of wasting two years learning science.” DVET officials said the reason for popularity and demand for ITI courses was due to the fact that the candidates have a high rate of job opportunities open once they are out of the course and the fees were less and also duration of courses varied from one year to three years. Courses in motor mechanics, electrician, tool and dye maker, refrigeration are in very high demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/placements-draw-pupils-to-govt-itis-90-seats-fill-up/articleshow/87599509.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Nearly 90% seats have been filled up this year as against the private-run ITIs that have struggled to fill up even 50% of total seats at the end of the admission season this year. The choice of courses offered at the government ITIs has also been a big draw for the students, principals of the institutes said. During the current admission season, over 1.11 lakh students from across the state have confirmed their seats in the centralised admission process system conducted by the state Directorate of Vocational Education and Training. Admissions in-charge for ITIs, Yogesh Patil said, “The main reason for the students to choose government ITIs is fee, quality teaching and also good placements and choice of courses. Any student applying for the ITIs would first give a choice for a government institute and if he / she does not fit the merit then they would opt for private ITIs.” In the previous year, the admissions had been hit due to the pandemic and the registrations were comparatively low. Till the fourth round, only 50 % admissions were confirmed this year. However, it picked up in the later stage and the maximum choice was given to government ITIs, Patil said. Gaurav More, a student, who has confirmed admission at the Aundh ITI, said, “I had earlier thought of doing engineering degree after completing science in FYJC. But later I changed my plan as I got admission to Aundh ITI as they have some good courses and I can start with my choice of course right from the beginning instead of wasting two years learning science.” DVET officials said the reason for popularity and demand for ITI courses was due to the fact that the candidates have a high rate of job opportunities open once they are out of the course and the fees were less and also duration of courses varied from one year to three years. Courses in motor mechanics, electrician, tool and dye maker, refrigeration are in very high demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/placements-draw-pupils-to-govt-itis-90-seats-fill-up/articleshow/87599512.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Hyderabad||Telangana forms panel to ensure ‘Covid death’ mention in certificates||HYDERABAD: The state government on Monday issued orders to constitute a district-level Covid-19 death ascertaining committee (CDAC), which will ensure mention of ‘death due to Covid’ on the death certificates of patients who passed away due to coronavirus. Till Monday, the state had officially recorded 3,967 deaths due to Covid-19. The formation of the committee is crucial in light of the Centre’s announcement of Covid death ex-gratia of Rs50,000, as families of hundreds of patients who died while undergoing Covid-19 treatment were handed death certificates citing other reasons for death. The district level committee will be responsible for issuing of ‘official document for Covid-19 death’ as per the guidelines issued by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Indian Council of Medical Research. Previously, only in case of a Covid-19 patient not having any previous ailment or comorbidity, were deaths counted as caused by Covid-19. This left many with grievances as they could not avail the ex-gratia extended by the Centre. “The committee shall examine grievances... and propose necessary remedial measures, including issuance of amended official document for Covid-19 death after verifying facts...” read an order by secretary health, SAM Rizvi, on Monday. The application has to be disposed off within 30 days of submission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/panel-to-ensure-covid-death-mentioned-in-certificates/articleshow/87593898.cms||---

According to authorities, no cases have been recorded in the other nine districts of the state. However, a major cause of concern continues to be the presence of three out of the four strains of the virus – Denv1, Denv2 and Denv3 - in Dehradun. Out of these, Denv2 is considered to be the most virulent due to its potential to cause hemorrhagic fever. The hotspots of dengue in Dehradun are Indira Nagar, Seema Dwar and Vasant Vihar, officials said. In Haridwar district, outbreaks have occurred in Narsen, Bhagwanpur, Roorkee, Bhadrabad and Haridwar blocks. Most of the cases have been in October. As per data accessed by TOI, Haridwar had just one case in August, eight in September, 511 in October and 13 till November 6.According to Haridwar’s vector-borne diseases team, despite witnessing the highest number of cases, the virus strains in the district remain unidentified. “The samples sent for testing to Chandigarh had low virus load because of which the strains could not be identified. Now, the samples are being sent to a Delhi-based laboratory,” said vector-borne disease officer Gurnam Singh. Meanwhile, a two-member team from National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi, is on a visit to Uttarakhand on the directions of the Union health ministry and will be carrying samples for virus strains identification to Delhi. On November 1, the Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya had directed the ministry officials to visit eight states where the dengue load is exceedingly high, including Uttarakhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/705-dengue-cases-in-ukhand-550-in-haridwar-alone/articleshow/87593174.cms||Shivani Azad

Ashwinder Singh Mongia, spokesperson, Punjab Petrol Pump Dealers Association said, “In the present situation, a drum of diesel containing about 200 litres will save farmers Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,300 per drum on purchase from Chandigarh, Himachal Pradesh and J&K where the VAT is still lower and diesel price is lesser than Punjab. Our demand was to bring fuel rates at par with the neighbouring states but Punjab still waits for more damage to the petrol dealers.” Petrol pump dealers association members said that Punjab government move of reducing VAT on petrol and diesel would have serious repercussions on the petroleum trade in Punjab.

---||Delhi||Automated gates, audit of courts among safety steps proposed by HC||New Delhi: Regular security audit of courts by Delhi Police, automated gates like those installed at Metro stations, stickers for vehicles and digital entry cards for advocates. Delhi High Court on Monday proposed these steps to make courts in the capital safe and secure and said it expected full cooperation from the Delhi government, police and lawyers in this regard. A bench comprising Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh was hearing a case initiated by it in the wake of the September 24 shootout that killed three people in a courtroom in Rohini Court. It suggested that the city government should be accountable for allocation of budget for the purchase of security devices and the police, which has expertise, can buy them under intimation to the government and the court. The court listed out some of the measures that can be taken by authorities while clarifying that it is open to modifying or changing the list after the stakeholders have studied the suggestions “summarised” by it. Based on the inputs received from Delhi Police and various lawyers’ bodies, the court said it would issue detailed directions. In the summary prepared by the court, it said the police commissioner would put together a team of experts for a security audit of courts and deploy an appropriate number of personnel. It added that the entry of all, including advocates, would be subject to frisking and passing through metal detectors, and no baggage be allowed inside courts without scanning. The court also suggested placing all court complexes under round-the-clock CCTV monitoring, issuing stickers to vehicles that may be permitted entry inside a court complex and installing vehicle scanning system as well as automated gates to tackle crowds. The court further said that the Bar Council of Delhi should devise a mechanism to issue non-transferable identity cards having a QR-code or a chip to lawyers. It also said that wherever possible, high-risk undertrials should be produced virtually or else, in vulnerable witness rooms or in jails themselves. During the hearing, Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma highlighted that during Diwali, certain lawyers in Rohini court raised objections to being subjected to security checks. “You (Bar bodies) should pass a resolution on this point that there may not be any negative reaction. Lawyers should have faith in leaders, otherwise no work will be done,” the chief justice responded. The court had on September 30 initiated a PIL concerning security at courts and observed there was a need for proper and effective deployment of a sufficient number of police personnel in courts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/automated-gates-audit-of-courts-among-safety-steps-proposed-by-hc/articleshow/87593909.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The commission has also issued notice to Delhi Police’s Crime Branch seeking lodging of an FIR in the matter. An official from DCW said that they received several complaints against prostitution rackets being run in spas in Delhi. As a part of its inquiry, the commission had set up an investigative team that called the online service provider and sought numbers of spas operating in south Delhi, the official added. “Within 24 hours, our team received over 15 calls and 32 WhatsApp messages from certain spas wherein pictures of more than 150 young girls along with the rates of the services offered were shared. For instance, a message was received from a phone number wherein the picture of a young girl was sent by the spa followed by messages detailing charges of sexual services. They shared different rates on hourly basis and depending upon different services. The rates varied from Rs 2,500 to Rs 7,000,” the official said. The DCW team only requested details of the spa service, but the so-called spas immediately provided details regarding the illegal prostitution activities they were indulging in. The search engine management has been asked to explain their policy for background checks of the spas listed with them. The panel has sought a detailed action taken report by November 12. DCW chairperson Swati Maliwal said the blatancy and impunity with which prostitution rackets were operating in the city was shocking. “We have summoned the service provider to investigate their role in the matter and have also issued a notice to Delhi Police for immediately registering an FIR and arresting the people involved. The commission is against objectification and commercial sexual exploitation of girls and shall leave no stone unturned to stop it,” Maliwal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dcw-notice-to-online-search-engine-over-role-in-sex-racket/articleshow/87593923.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Rakesh Kumar, a resident of Balewadi, said, “The first day is called Nahaye Khaye, which simply translates to bathing and eating. We bathe and make simple food comprising a preparation made from bottle gourd, chana dal and rice. The second day is called Kharna.

The theft came light on November 7, when the complainant returned home after celebrating Diwali at his native place. “The suspects broke the back door of the complainant’s house and stole the television set and the cylinder,” an officer from the Chakan police said. He said that the complaint’s house was burgled and gold ornaments were stolen during Diwali last year. “This year, the complainant did not keep any valuables in the house,” the officer said. He said that the police suspect involvement of some known person, who was aware that the complainant would not be there during Diwali. “We are working on some clues,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/thieves-steal-led-tv-gas-cylinder-from-medics-home/articleshow/87593201.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Krish Food minister||Times News Network Kolkata Bengal food minister Rathin Ghosh said that the free ration to poors will continue whether the Centre stops the scheme or not. "Apart from requesting the Centre to continue the scheme, we are exploring alternate ways so that the free ration could continue even if the Centre closes it next month," said Ghosh. "We don't know the reason behind the sudden halt of the 'Garib Kalyan Yojona.' It is not that the condition of poor people across the nation have uplifted overnight," said Ghosh. But Mamata Banerjee government would never deprive poors of their rights to survival. In 2020 March, PM Narendra Modi started Garib Kalyan Yojona for distributing ration among the poor which was later extended till November 30. 80 crore people were beneficiaries of the scheme. But the Centre said that it would not extend the scheme any further. The poors will keep receiving the benefit of free ration under Khadya Sathi scheme. TMC MP Saugata Roy had on Saturday written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting him to extend Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PM-GKAY) for the next six months. "The central government announced that from November 30, the free ration being given under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana will stop. I have written a letter to the Prime Minister requesting that the scheme should be given an extension for at least another 6 months because the pandemic is not over yet. Many people still do not have employment, they should keep the scheme going for another six months, otherwise, people will suffer," said Roy in his letter to the PM. Roy's letter to the Prime Minister comes a day after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote to PM Modi on Saturday, requesting him to extend the Central government's quota of free ration supply until May 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/krish-food-minister/articleshow/87593217.cms||---

The project is among several novel projects approved in the general meeting of district planning council chaired by guardian minister Satej Patil on Monday. The council approved total outlay of Rs 493 crore on various schemes and sectors for next one year. The outlay for next one year is higher than last year. Last year, total outlay of Rs 448 crore was approved out of which Rs 443 crore have been spent. Hatkanangle MP Dhairyasheel Mane, who had proposed the idea, said, “Several fruits, berries and nuts naturally grown in the forest areas have large demand for medicinal and food purposes. The processing units will help the locals to make jams, jellies and other item from these wild fruits. It has huge potential to produce local employment.” He added that most people from forest areas have to migrate to cities for jobs. They have also proposed growing of Tussar silk in the forest talukas. Already, a marketing and collection centre has been set up at Jaysingpur for silk-made items. The council has set aside Rs 1.42 crore to make finance available to the self-help groups to set up the processing units on a smaller scale. The schools in Kolhapur district, which have completed 100 years, will be given incentives to encourage them to undertake infrastructural work. Guardian minister Satej Patil said that an ambitious scheme of a new police helpline ‘112’ will be implemented in the district. “Police will reach the spot within 10 minutes. We are going to procure 100 vehicles, both two-wheelers and four-wheelers, to facilitate police for rapid response. We have allocated Rs 4.65 crore for the same,” said Patil. He said that the renovation work of memorial pillar installed in memory of martyred police will be done. Another initiative to set up waiting rooms at each police station by spending Rs 15 lakh will be taken in the coming year. A conveyor will also be installed at Irani quary to be used during large size Ganesh idol immersion, he said. Citizen 360 District collector Rahul Rekhawar proposed idea of data collection of all sectors under a programme named Citizen 360. It will collect data, process and implement schemes and utilise funds as per the need.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/units-to-process-wild-fruits-will-be-set-up-in-kolhapur/articleshow/87593915.cms||---

A murder case was registered against 10 unidentified persons, dressed in blue clothes and travelling in two boats, at Navi Bandar Marine police station on Sunday. According to police, around 4 pm on November 6 an Indian fishing boat named 'Jalpari' was fired upon about 12 nautical miles off the Okha coast in Devbhumi Dwarka district. A fisherman named Shridhar Chamre (32), a resident of Palgharh in Maharashtra, died while Dilip Solanki, who lives in Diu, suffered injuries. Solanki had a lucky escape as a bullet brushed past his face. After the incident, the boat returned to Okha in the early hours of Sunday and Chamre’s body was sent to Jamnagar for postmortem by a panel of doctors. Solanki too is undergoing treatment for the injury on his face. Police said that the boat has also suffered damages in the firing. The boat owned by Jayanti Rathod had set sail with seven fishermen on board on October 25. Meanwhile, another fishing boat from Porbandar was taken into custody by Pakistan on the same day. Former president of Marine Fisheries Cooperative Manish Lodhari said that the boat along with six fishermen on board were taken into custody and taken to Karachi. He added that so far 1,130 boats have been taken away by Pakistan and 345 fishermen are still languishing in Pakistani jails. Seven fishermen rescued by ICG Seven fishermen were rescued by the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) after their boat caught fire mid-sea on Sunday. The boat named ‘Kushal Raj’ got engulfed in fire due to fuel leakage from its engine. An ICG ship ‘Arush’ which was patrolling in the Arabian Sea rushed to the help and even engaged in fire-fighting, but as the fire had engulfed the entire boat, it sank. The seven fishermen on board the boat were rescued and brought to Okha by ICG.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/maha-fisherman-killed-in-firing-by-pmsa-off-guj-coast/articleshow/87593214.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Young entrepreneurs make most of new opportunities||Change is inspiring Change is a constant and a disruption only when viewed that way. Nine years back, Inderjeet Kumar saw a computer for the first time. The 11-year-old pressed the keys with trepidation. Soon, the clicks grew more confident and purposeful and eventually, he earned the title of “Young Tech Turk.” The list of his achievements is formidable. Even before he completed his schooling, he created an application for mid-day meal and report cards for Haryana government schools. He received an award from SCERT (State Council of Educational Research and Training) in science exhibition and got first prize in cluster, block, district and state level. The Young India Foundation also conferred a national award on him. Thereafter, he created a game titled, ‘Kaun Banega Lakhpati,’ which was adopted by the Haryana government. His genius notwithstanding, the child prodigy did not have funds for further education. Therefore, he enrolled as a part-time science teacher in an NGO. By the time he started college, he aimed at creating a startup that disrupts the tech sector. So Bambi Haijeet was born. Inderjeet, 20, said, “At Bambi Haijeet, we build technological products that create a difference for our clients all over the world. We also fuel the online presence of the brands we work with.” Inderjeet believes in making the most of his time. He follows a schedule rigidly and does not make allowances. “I am extremely grateful to the department of higher education, Haryana and SACC India for nurturing me. They taught me how to approach clients, create proposals and much more. Recently, I even got free AWS credits thanks to them,” said the third year B.Sc computer science student of Dronacharya Government College, who was incubated by the startup incubator at his college. Fitness pays One fine day, Shahid walked into the startup incubator at Dronacharya Government college, Gurugram and announced that he had won the third position in Mr Delhi category men’s physical organised by IBBF and had been shortlisted for Mr India. The announcement was met with loud cheers. The third-year BA Economics honours student of Dronacharya Government College proudly wears the badge of Mr Delhi 2020 and is the fourth position holder of the Vijay Classic 2021 competition. Since his life revolved around fitness, he chose to make it the theme of his startup. During the lockdown, he learned how to amalgamate fitness with technology and started taking his fitness classes online. Today his online body transformation classes are hugely in demand. He uses the online world to train his students, monitor their progress and map their diet. “The world of fitness and startup is all about discipline. I wake up at 4am to ensure that I train my students and run my startup. A few months prior to the competition, I had completely cut myself from the outside world. I did not speak on the phone, nor did I use social media. My energy was focused on my competition,” said the fitness guru. His gym houses 130 members and his online body transformation classes have hundreds of students. Speaking about how the department of higher education and incubation centre nurtured him, he said, “Initially, online training was difficult. However, at the incubation centre, I learnt how I could fuse technology and fitness. I am working on skill building in the house of the centre of excellence to run my startup successfully. I am attending mentoring sessions on sales and marketing arranged by SACC India, getting access to great tools made available by the startup incubation team and leveraging the network provided by them to scale up my business.” Inspiring biz leaders When Covid sent the world into lockdown, inspiration was needed to boost flagging morale. When the second wave struck, Rahul, a commerce graduate of government college, Sector 1, Panchkula was fascinated by the online sessions of his college’s startup incubator, especially the Technology Made Easy series. Therefore, he decided to create a platform where he would curate stories of the founders and leaders of various startups in the region. Rahul believes that as a founder, it is critical to stay on top of the newest trends, best practices and more. “When you don’t have time to read an article, a book or watch videos, there is my podcast to learn more about the startup industry and the people who build and grow startups,” he said. Rahul put all of this together as a business named Stay Hustle. He curates and covers stories from the region’s startup founders and business leaders. They discuss how they came up with their concept, the passion that keeps them going, the obstacles they had to overcome, their accomplishments, how they raised funds and the lessons they learnt along the way. A practical platform Harsh Adhana, a final year student of B.Sc at Nehru College, Faridabad capitalised on video makers’ need for simple solutions with Bang Bang- an online video creating platform. It allows users to create short videos through which they can add music, effects and more. Its USP is its simplicity. The content created with Bang Bang can be used by businesses to advertise their products and services. User privacy is maintained and no information is revealed without their permission. Being at an initial stage, their main aim is to launch the app at the earliest to start revenue generation and deliver a hassle free experience to users. They want to get a chunk of the $20 billion digital content creation industry led by platforms like MX taka tak, Josh, Moj etc. Offering digital solutions Not too far from Chandigarh, a few computer science students of government college, Karnal joined hands to provide digital solutions to clients. Mayank and Aashish, co-founders of Digicell, boost their customers’ digital presence using various platforms like Facebook marketing, E-mail marketing, Whatsapp marketing, SEO, SMO among others. Before the pandemic, their clients were marketing their products in offline mode but with the lockdown came a massive need for digital presence. An estimate suggests that the Covid-19 situation doubled the growth of the digital marketing industry. Sensing the opportunity, they started offering the right services at the right time. With their learnings, they are able to sustain and grow their clientele while generating steady cash flow for their start-up. Global opportunities Speaking about the startup incubators, Anand Mohan Sharan, principal secretary Higher Education Haryana said “Our startup incubators in Panchkula, Karnal, Hisar, Faridabad and Gurugram are established in non-technology institutions, yet we are glad to see many technology startups emerging from these centres of excellence. Such businesses have global scalability prospects and we are hopeful that they will add to economic development and employment generation in the towns where they are located and the state of Haryana.” “Being a technology founder over the last two decades, I know the speed and scale one can achieve with the right approach. We are available to create opportunities for these young entrepreneurs across our vast network of Netsmartz group companies. From providing appropriate market access to mentoring them on the right business model to eventually opening the doors for raising venture capital, we are unlocking such channels one at a time for these founders supported by the startup incubators of higher education, Haryana,” said Manipal Dhariwal, president, SACC India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/young-entrepreneurs-make-most-of-new-opportunities/articleshow/87593203.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: Virtual friend dupes senior citizen of Rs 4.4 lakh with gift lure||PUNE: Befriending a stranger on a social networking site proved costly for a 62-year-old woman from a business family residing on Ganeshkhind Road, as she lost Rs 4.42 lakh in the hope of getting an expensive gift promised by the friend on her birthday on April 24. The woman had filed a complaint application with the cyber police, which did the verification and referred the matter to the Chatushrungi police for registration of an FIR on Sunday. “The verification revealed that the money transferred by the victim through four RTGS transactions went to two private bank accounts in Delhi and Noida,” senior inspector Rajkumar Waghchaure of the Chatushrungi police told TOI. He said, “The fraudster(s) had used bogus SIM cards to call the woman and also fake documents to open the bank accounts where the money had landed and later siphoned off. The police will now establish the money trail and will investigate the source of the bogus SIM cards and documents to reach the culprits. We have obtained details of two cell phone numbers, which the suspects had used, and we are working on them.” Waghchaure said in March, the woman had accepted a friend request from a man, who claimed to be based in England. “The two started chatting regularly and shared each other’s phone numbers. The man, who had studied her social networking profile carefully, promised to send her an expensive birthday gift,” he said. Waghchaure said on April 8, the victim received a call from a woman, who said was a customs officer at Delhi airport. The woman told the victim she will have to pay customs duty and other clearing charges for a parcel containing some expensive article, which had arrived in her name.  Cyber police said 173 gift fraud cases have been received since January 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/virtual-friend-dupes-senior-citizen-of-rs-4-4l-with-gift-lure/articleshow/87593207.cms||---

According to his counsel, the freelance journalist-cumpolitical activist has been in the eye of a storm ever since his aggressive speeches against the current state government incurred the wrath of the state. Multiple FIRs were registered against him at various police stations and the high court earlier asked the police not to do so and they can, instead, add the new material if any, to the existing ones. Justice Sridevi imposed certain conditions that Mallanna should appear before the investigators twice a month and regularly before the trial court. “He should not influence the witnesses or indulge in inflammatory speeches ,” Sridevi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-grants-bail-to-mallanna/articleshow/87593928.cms||M Sagar Kumar
---||Aurangabad||No official celebration of Bird Week irks many||Aurangabad: Even if the ruling MVA government has announced Bird Festival every year from November 5 to November 12, the alleged no official celebration on behalf of the forest department in Aurangabad division has annoyed bird lovers and ornithologists. Started since last year, the Bird Week was envisaged as the initiative to create public awareness about the rich diversity of birds and their importance in the overall environment. The Bird Week coincides with the birthday of veteran wildlife conservationist Maruti Chitampalli and concludes with the birth anniversary of legendary ornithologist and Padma Vibhushan Salim Ali. Honorary wildlife warden for Aurangabad Kishor Pathak said the initiatives such as Bird Week must be implemented in letter and spirit. “Many still do not know even about the common birds found in Maharashtra and their importance for human being as well as the overall ecology. As awareness is the first major step towards conservation, awareness activities such as Bird Week and Wildlife Week must be celebrated by involving large number of children, youth and public at large,” he said. Nilesh Dharashivkar, a bird enthusiast, said Bird Week can serve as an appropriate opportunity to make the public aware of danger faced by different habitats of birds. “Even some of the birds who are listed as “Least Concerned” in terms of status, are witnessing decline in population due to the shrinking habitats. A large public awareness is needed to protect birds and their habitats,” he said. Top forest department officials could not be reached for their comments despite repeated attempts to contact them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/no-official-celebration-of-bird-week-irks-many/articleshow/87593925.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Breathalyzer test back to check drink-driving||Kolkata: Cops re-introduced breathalyzer test, which had been suspended for almost 20 months due to the pandemic, on Monday following a spurt in drink-driving cases since October. “The tests have begun at our night nakas from Monday,” said DCP (traffic), Arijit Sinha. Cops have already prosecuted 230 people under Section 185 of the Motor Vehicles Act (driving by a drunken person) since October 1, which is a steep increase compared to last year during the same period. A new device that was introduced in the beginning of last year allows a person to blow from a distance of around 5cm, instead of getting a pipe inside the mouth, said a traffic cop. There has been a consistent demand from the 25 traffic guards to use breathalyzers once again.  “Cops on duty at nakas, conducted for barely two hours during Durga Puja, reported at least six cases of drink driving each night. However, identifying the drink driving cases became a challenging task without checking a suspect physically. This means both the suspect and the cop would have to come in close proximity with each other without wearing a mask. When the suspects were taken to hospitals for their blood tests, doctors and attendants insisted on the breathalyzer test for confirmation,” said an officer. According to the police sources, the recent NCRB report that analysed the causes behind accidents in the city has also suggested the use of breathalyzers. Cops are taking adequate measures to ensure that basic Covid protocols are followed while conducting the breathalyzer test. “Earlier, anyone could be asked to blow through the breathalyser on the basis of suspicion. But now it has been verbally communicated across the traffic guards that only those with visible signs of intoxication should be subjected to the test to reduce the number of persons using the machine,” said an officer. Cops usually carry multiple pipes that are changed every time a person is tested, but as the number of tests goes up on weekends, the pipes are often washed for re-use. Since March last year, cops had put brakes on stopping motorists at random to check whether they were drunk or not.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/breathalyzer-test-back-to-check-drink-driving/articleshow/87593226.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Goa||Patnekar calls for greater women’s role in governance||Panaji: Legislative speaker Rajesh Patnekar on Monday said that political commitment, adequate legal and policy framework, electoral reforms and leadership training should be aimed at changing societal mindset and building an environment that is conducive to a greater role for women in Parliament, legislature and local self-bodies. “I hope that the symposium on this important theme will not only be meaningful, but also a resource of stipulating ideas for a plan of action for the empowerment of women for all its manifestation in development arenas,” he said at the inaugural ceremony of the National Women’s Parliament. Patnekar said that the programme is organised to commemorate the 60th year of Goa’s Liberation and 75th year of India’s Independence. He said that the United Nations declaration on women rights adopted by the United Nations general Assembly emphasises on gender equality, women participation in the decision-making process and their representation in the legislature such that it will lead to women empowerment in political, social and economic dimensions. “Women representation and participation in legislature is critical to achieving democracy in the true sense of the term which in turn can help in ushering an inclusive society. In order to have equal participation of women in decision making, we need to emphasise on appropriate enabling condition and finally change our mindset and societal outlook to whole issues,” the speaker said. “Our mindset and outlook towards women’s role in the family and society have to undergo a paradigm shift if they are to be part and parcel of the decision-making process. We as legislators need to introspect how we can facilitate more innovative policies so as to empower women and involve them in decision-making processes.,” he said. Curtorim MLA Alina Saldanha said that women are still considered as the weaker sex and are very often not given preference over her male counterpart. “Differences still exist, problems still exist, definitely at a much lesser level, but they do exist, and the national women parliament is a good opportunity because it will give us a stage to discuss these problems and to find a solution to these problems so that women can be on par with her male counterpart,” she said. The male mental setup is very different from what it was to be a century ago, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/patnekar-calls-for-greater-womens-role-in-governance/articleshow/87593968.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

While hearing a PIL filed by Dehradun-based activist, Abhinav Thapar, the division bench of Uttarakhand HC of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice NS Dhanik issued notice and called for a response from the respondents in four weeks, to the PIL, wherein it has been contended that the Tehri Dam Hydro Project has not adequately compensated the residents of Tehri, in terms of employment avenues, generation of revenue as well as ecologically. The petitioner on the basis of various sections in the Uttar Pradesh Reorganisation Act 2000 and reportedly from the inspiration of late Sunder Lal Bahuguna's statement "ecology is permanent economy", has demanded to provide 100% income earned from Tehri dam to the state of Uttarakhand, so that the entire portion can be used in the interest of the state. Thapar, a displaced Dehradun resident, has filed the PIL saying the dam is spread in and around the Tehri area. The dam's boundary is not connected with any other state, yet 12% of the income from the dam is given to the Uttarakhand government, while the remaining 88% is given to the central and UP governments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-seeks-response-on-plea-for-spending-money-from-tehri-dam-on-displaced-people/articleshow/87593218.cms||---

Registrations for the test, which is being organised by the SRFTI this year, will close on December 2, a release from the FTII said, with details available on the respective institutes’ websites. According to an agreement between the two film and television schools, each of them organizes and runs the test over a two-year cycle. The responsibility of organizing the test will return to the FTII from 2022. The JET is generally held in the month of February each year, with this year’s test having to be postponed earlier in the year, due to the onset of the second wave of the pandemic and the ensuing restrictions. However, with a number of batches scheduled to be on campus as educational institutions slowly reopening, and a limited number of accommodations on campus, officials said that next year’s test may also have to be delayed beyond the February window. FTII sources had earlier expected that a year of admission may have to be foregone. “The modalities for next year’s entrance test still needs to be decided. Currently, the oldest batch on the rolls are scheduled to finish their courses in around six months, because that was their syllabus backlog when we had to close due to the restrictions. That will free up some of the hostel rooms, after which it will be turn of the 2017 batch to graduate,” said Bhupendra Kainthola, the director of FTII. Batches in staggered manner The FTII added that it has communicated to its students a staggered schedule for them to return back to campus for in-person classes and practical sessions, in accordance with guidelines from the state government and the Pune Municipal Corporation. “The authorities have instructed us to call back students to the campus in a staggered manner, and we have written to them. The first batch is arriving on November 15, the next one on November 22, and the rest in December,” Kainthola added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ftii-entrance-test-in-dec-date-for-next-year-later/articleshow/87593210.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Pune||3 injured in attack by leopard, hyena at Manchar in Ambegaon taluka in 2 days||Pune: Two farmers were injured in a leopard attack at Landewadi-Chinchodi village, while a woman was injured in an attack by a hyena in Anganwadi village, both near Manchar in Ambegaon taluka, over the last two days. The injured farmers have been identified as Pravin Lande and his wife Shalini Lande. All three victims are undergoing treatment at the Manchar sub-district hospital where their condition was reported to be stable. The Junnar forest division officials have set up four cages in these villages to trap wild animals. They pointed out that with the sugarcane cutting operations on across the district, they were anticipating greater movement of wild animals as they search for safer places to hide. The sightings and attacks are also a consequence of such movement, officials said. Jayram Gowda, deputy conservator of forest, Junnar division, said, “Farmers were attacked when they were returning home on bike after finishing their work on the farm. The animal crossing the road suddenly saw them from a close distance and attacked them before running into the sugarcane field. Both the farmers received minor injuries on their hands.” “The woman was attacked when she went to attend the nature’s call. We suspect that the attack was triggered by her sudden appearance. She has received required medical attention at the hospital,” Gowda added. He said citizens residing near sugarcane fields need to be careful as wild animals that took shelter in the fields are moving to new areas to hide. “We are creating awareness about this aspect among citizens,” a senior official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/3-injured-in-attack-by-leopard-hyena-at-manchar-in-ambegaon-taluka-in-2-days/articleshow/87593238.cms||---

Women who are chairing these crucial posts can work effectively if they know the entire system well,” she said, while addressing a special meet of women village heads. Stating that women are leaving their mark in every field, Gorhe said female sarpanchs can carve their niche in politics as well. “The presence of women in politics definitely invites many challenges. However, women can overcome all hurdles if they are determined and gain necessary knowledge,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/sena-hosts-meet-of-woman-sarpanchs/articleshow/87593942.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Marathwada emerges as agitation’s epicentre||Aurangabad: The Marathwada region, which has so far witnessed buses being cancelled on routes measuring nearly of 38 lakh km, has emerged as the epicentre of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) employees’s stir. When the stir had started on October 27, there was partial response — that too from Marathwada. Now it has intensified, and has caused the transport utility losses to the turn of Rs 65 crore so far, an MSRTC spokesperson said on Monday. The Marathwada division, where all the 47 depots were hit by the strike on Monday, has the largest share in the losses (Rs 18 crore), revealed the official data. Even passengers are struggling. “We were forced to take crowded private buses and spend more money. It makes no sense to hold the public to ransom,” said Manohar Doifode, a senior citizen. “The MSRTC has witnessed bus cancellations on routes measuring 1.09 crore km since the agitation began. We appeal to our employees to call off the strike in order to prevent passengers from being inconvenienced,” the spokesperson said. Though the state government, acting on the directives of the Bombay high court, announced the formation of a three-member committee to look into demands of the MSRTC employees on Monday, several workers’ unions have said they would continue the agitation until their demands are fulfilled. Headed by state chief secretary, the committee is expected to submit its recommendations in 12 weeks. “The state cabinet should have first passed a resolution in support of our demands. The formation of a committee sounds like a time-killing tactic,” said a conductor, preferring anonymity. The key demands of the MSRTC employees include merger of the state transport body into the state government and hike of 28% and 3% in DA and HRA, respectively. Besides BJP, which is accused of fuelling the agitation, MNS has also extended its support to the strike. The local unit of MNS on Monday met the agitating workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/marathwada-emerges-as-agitations-epicentre/articleshow/87591709.cms||Prasad Joshi

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Min puts onus of tax data on corp||Thiruvananthapuram: Going by the state government’s stand, the blame is entirely on city corporation, which has been grappling with issues regarding inaccuracies in property tax database. LSG minister M V Govindan, in his reply in the ongoing assembly session, said that the software fails to reflect information on tax, which has been paid, because the staff concerned do not post the payments promptly. With this, the LSG minister has squarely put the blame on the civic body and in a way brushed aside the slew of formal communications from city corporation that explain the glaring lapses of IKM software. Govindan said that there is a complaint redressal system for IKM software, and if at all any complaints arise, they are resolved without delay. The software promptly records and reflects all the tax payments made online or via front office and this information is available on the login assigned to each civic body. Only the collections received by local bodies manually through outdoor or camp collections do not reflect in software because the staff concerned may have failed to post the data, he added. The manner in which Govindan distanced himself from the grave issues regarding IKM software repeatedly presented before him and former LSG minister is a clear indication that the issue regarding tax database may be far from over for the civic body. In October, barely two weeks before the minister gave this reply in the assembly, the revenue wing of city corporation had flagged glaring shortcomings in IKM software in the latest letter sent to the head of IKM. This was not the first: corporation had highlighted the issues and glitches in IKM softwares, and references to similar communications in the past had also been mentioned in the letter. While corporation needs to update records of around 4.5 lakh tax assessments, the revenue wing had reported that buildings dated from 2016-17 alone can be assessed using the software, and it has no facility to register buildings before that with retrospective effect. Even though service cess is being calculated in city corporation along with property tax for the past three years, the software has no facility to add service cess in buildings assessed before the cess came into effect. While merging the database before 2016, the officials tried posting the tax for a whole year; however, the system would still reflect that of half year, shows the letter sent to IKM . The letter also lists out other technical glitches like delay, frequent instances of system snags which delayed the process of data updation. Further, there is no way to assess tax before 2016 which was calculated based on annual rental value. With regard to tax relaxation for ex-service men, the software has no provision to update it annually after scrutiny of documents. The software lacks the feature to incorporate decisions made by the tax appeal standing committee of the civic body concerned. A lengthy list of such issues has been presented to the local self government department since 2018, but no concrete solution has been arrived at, so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/min-puts-onus-of-tax-data-on-corp/articleshow/87593262.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Maha||Nashik: Thousands of passengers in the five districts of Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon, Ahmednagar and Nandurbar bore the brunt of the strike by the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) employees as no bus service was available in 41 of the 44 bus depots in these districts. A large number of employees had decided to join the strike, in demand of corporation’s merger with the state government, on Sunday. As a result, bus transport came to standstill from early morning on Monday. The buses from the Nandurbar depot and two depots in Nashik district — Igatpuri and Nandgaon — were working in the first half of the day, but later these depots too stopped the buses. “Since Sunday afternoon, the employees across the region started voicing support for the strike. They refused to pick up the bus schedules from the depots in the evening. Since Monday morning, the buses did not ply from almost all the depots,” a senior officer from the regional MSRTC office said. The three main bus terminuses in Nashik city, which usually remain crowded around this time, wore a deserted look. The commuters who were aware of the strike, had already abandon their journey plans. Those who had to travel, were seen booking private bus tickets. “I have to go to Dhule. The MSRTC officials said there is no bus service today (Monday). I am now worried,” said Vaishali Jamkhedkar, a passenger. “Both the state government and the MSRTC employees know that during this time (post Diwali) people travel in large numbers. A strike now is causing hardships to the commuters,” Rajesh Jahagirdar, another commuter, said. On Monday, in the Nashik region alone, the MSRTC lost around Rs 95 lakh in revenue when compared to the Diwali season last year. About 2,500 bus schedules — covering about 2.7 lakh km — were cancelled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/msrtc-staff-stir-cripples-bus-services-in-n-maha/articleshow/87591726.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

While the minimum temperature has been sliding over the last two days and it fell to 18.3°C on Monday, it will start climbing up once the cloud cover takes over, said weathermen. “Over the last two days, northwesterly winds have been flowing into the region, pulling the mercury down. But the wind pattern has changed and easterly winds have started flowing into the region. This has led to moisture incursion from the Bay of Bengal. This will result in a cloud cover and a rise in temperature. But we don’t expect rain,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director, GK Das. The cloud cover is expected from Wednesday and may last till November 14. “It could be partially cloudy at times and the temperature may climb past 20-21°C over the next few days,” added Das. On Monday, the minimum temperature slid three degrees below normal. According to the Met officials, the sudden slide in mercury in early-November is unusual. “The minimum temperature rarely starts dropping below 20°C before November-end. This year has been an exception. But the cloud cover will interrupt the cool spell now and the mercury will keep climbing up and down till the end of the month,” said Das. The onset of winter is not expected in Kolkata before mid-December. “The minimum temperature should remain below 15°C for three days in a row for winter to set in officially,” said Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cloud-cover-likely-in-city-from-tomorrow-temp-to-rise/articleshow/87593277.cms||---

A sea court will be organised in front of the Secretariat on Tuesday to raise the issues faced by the people in the coastal region. Activities such as street drama, street painting, sea songs, folk songs, poetry and documentary screenings will also be part of the strike. The strike is being organised by “Theerabhoo Samrakshana Vedi”. The coastal people will be deciding their own justice since the government failed in giving it to them, according to the organisers. Over 150 residents from the coastal areas will be staging a strike in front of the Secretariat on Tuesday and Wednesday. The strike will start at 11:00am and continue till 11:00 am the next day. The coastal people have put forward a few demands. Due to the continuous natural disasters, including cyclones and tidal surge, thousands of people along the coastal area are living as refugees in their relatives’ houses. They need to be rehabilitated immediately. Until then, the government has to pay them house rent. The resettlement plan announced in the name of rehabilitation for coastal people is a fraud, they alleged. They said that the fishing communities are being evicted from the coast and those areas are handed over to corporates and the tourism mafia, the organisers alleged. As the right of the forest was guaranteed to tribespeople, the right of the coastal areas should be given to the coastal people, they said. The government should be ready to change policies that make the coastal people live like refugees. MPs, MLAs, trade union leaders, writers, art, culture and human rights activists will take part in the strike. Opposition leader VD Satheesan will inaugurate the event on Tuesday at 11am.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/sea-court-to-be-set-up-as-protest-at-secretariat/articleshow/87593283.cms||---

The Surendranagar police have also named the deceased gangster Hanif Khan Jat Malek alias Kalo alias Munno (44) and his son Madin Jat Malek (18) in the FIR, along with five others. A mob of over a dozen people had attacked the cops on Saturday night when they arrived in Gediya village to arrest Hanif. Police fired in self-defence after Hanif shot three rounds at cops. Though no cop was injured, Hanif and his son were shot dead in police firing. According to police, when they went to arrest Hanif who was wanted in several cases including one under GujCTOC (The Gujarat Control of Terrorism and Organized Crime) Act, his family members and others attacked them. Bajana police inspector V M Jadeja, who is the complainant in the case, alleged that Hanif’s mother-in-law Hanifaben, his brother-in-law Ismail, his mother Hava and father Amirkhan Jat malek and 15 unknown persons attacked the police team to prevent arrest. They attacked them with blunt weapons, pipes, sticks and obstructed cops from discharging their duties. All were booked for attempt to murder, rioting and other sections of Indian Penal Code and the Arms Act. “Hanif had fired three shots at the police team, while his son Madin had attacked them with a dharia (bill hook). Two cops were injured in the bill hook attack. In retaliation, cops fired three rounds in which Hanif and Madin were killed,” deputy superintendent of police H P Joshi had told TOI. However, Hanif’s family members had alleged that the police had deliberately shot him and refused to accept the bodies. Hanif’s daughter Simran also alleged that her brother Madin killed in the encounter was just 16-year-old. On Sunday night, after the intervention of police, the family accepted the bodies. Serial offenders Hanif was among the three absconding criminals in Surendranagar wanted in GujCTOC case. Police said that Hanif was a member of the notorious gang known as Gediya gang that targeted trucks on the highway. The gang used to loot goods from moving truck or after assaulting the driver of the vehicle on the highway during the night. Hanif has 86 offences registered against him, of which he was arrested in 59 cases. In other cases, he was shown as absconding. Offences against Hanif range from murder, attempt to murder, attack on police, theft, assault to name a few. Hanif was a member of Gediya gang whose members have over 125 cases registered against them in at least seven districts, said police. “Hanif’s wife Bilkis, his brother Rashid Khan, brother-in-law Wasim Khan and cousin Ajrat Khan are all in jail for offence registered under the GujCTOC Act,” said deputy superintendent of police H P Joshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/notorious-gangster-son-killed-in-police-encounter-in-patdi/articleshow/87593276.cms||---

While the case has been filed on March 18, 2008, the next hearing of the case is on March 18, 2022,” Malik tweeted on Monday. According to court records uploaded on the official website, a case was registered under Sections 3,4,5 and 8 of the NDPS Act. “This appears to be a typographical error. It is a case of PITA provisions, and our records reflect the same. Our team is taking the matter up with the court authorities,” Gupta said. The Pune police on Monday issued a statement, saying the then social security inspector Rajendra Bhamre and his team had raided a room in a plush star hotel in Bund Garden area and arrested Harshada and two others on October 13, 2007 under the provisions of PITA. A chargesheet was filed on January 14, 2008 against the three accused, and since then, the matter has been pending before the court. Wankhede’s wife Kranti Redkar tweeted on Monday, saying her sister will tackle Malik’s tweet legally and that her husband has no relation whatever with the case. “I know the media has a lot of questions on Malik’s tweet. I would like to say that my sister was and continues to be victim in this case. According to our legal team, it is not prudent to comment on the matter since it is subjudice,” she tweeted. According to reports, Wankhede too reacted sharply to Malik’s tweet. “I was not even in service when the incident took place in Pune. I got married to Kranti in 2017. Then how am I associated with the case in any way?” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaimantri-raises-wankhede-sis-in-law-drug-case-cops-clarify/articleshow/87594020.cms||---

The staffers are demanding the merger of MSRTC with the state government. The strike has especially affected those planning to travel back to other cities for work following the Diwali holidays. Vinayak Alvekar, a public works employee from Bidri village, was scheduled to catch a bus from Kolhapur to Satara, to reach Kadegaon village where he is posted. But the strike made him miss his first day back at work. “This kind of strike that inconveniences travellers is wrong. They should have intimated about the strike earlier so that we could have worked out other options. I have been stuck here for the past hour-and-a-half, searching for a solution,” Alvekar said. Private travel operators, meanwhile, made the most out of the situation. A ticket to Pune cost Rs2,000, while a seat to Mumbai cost Rs3,000. Mehboob Mulla, who was traveling to Mumbai, said, "This is more than twice the actual cost. If we must pay such hefty prices, we may as well travel by flight,” Mulla said. Avinash Chopade, a protestor affiliated to the MSRTC Kruti Samiti, said, "We also don't wish to inconvenience passengers, but we are left with no option.

Till Sunday evening, the fares on private buses operating on these route from Nashik had gone up from the Rs 300-400 range to Rs 500-700. “On Monday morning, the fares had increased to Rs 800-1,000 per person,” said Keshav Ranade, a Nashik residents who had come to the New CBS stand to see off his relatives travelling to Pune. Even passengers to Aurangabad, Amravati, Nagpur and other destinations reported similar price hikes. While travel to Aurangabad usually costs Rs 400, on Monday, tickets were being sold for Rs 800-1,000. Tickets for Amravati were available for Rs 1,700 — up from the usual Rs 1,000. While this was the rate charged by the booking agents, the one-the-spot rates charged by the bus operators were higher depending on the seats available and the number of passengers willing to ‘bid’ for the vacant seats. “They are taking the commuters for a ride,” said Gauri Rajput, a passenger waiting for a bus to Aurangabad. “I had come to Nashik to visit my maternal family. Because of the strike, I have taken the refund and have decided to stay back for some more time,” said Sunita Kamble, a homemaker. Sunil Shah, who too is touring Nashik with his family, has decided to return to his hotel. He will try to get a private transport later. There are many stuck in Mumbai or Borivali as well. “Schools are starting from Wednesday and I don’t know how I will travel to Nashik with my daughter,” said Sudha Joshi, a Nashik resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/desperate-commuters-shell-out-for-alternative-transport-options/articleshow/87591792.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Allahabad||AU to study UP journey from a ‘bemaru state’ to a ‘samarth rajya’, says Pradhan||Prayagraj: Union minister for education, skill development and entrepreneurship, Dharmendra Pradhan on Monday said “a detailed study would be conducted by Allahabad University as to how the state of Uttar Pradesh has become a ‘samarth rajya’ (capable state) from a ‘bemaru rajya’ (sick state).” The study would be conducted by the academicians working at the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay chair, which is being set up by the University Grants Commission (UGC) at AU on the instructions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Pradhan said while speaking as the chief guest at AU convocation held at the historic Senate Hall of the Arts campus. The minister further said that the Modi-led government at the Centre aims at improving the life of the common man standing at the last row of the society and universities can play an important role in this regard. “Researches should not be limited to getting papers published in reputed journals or promoting academics, but for the betterment of the society,” said Pradhan. Pradhan also appealed to the AU authorities as well as the institutes of higher studies in the country to implement employable courses as per the new National Education Policy (NEP). He also called upon the experts of the department of sociology of AU to conduct research on the migration of people witnessed in the country during the pandemic. He also applauded the efforts of the central Government in facing the challenge arising out of the pandemic. “In March-April 2020, our country did not have enough face masks or PPE kits, and now we produce not one but two effective vaccines against the coronavirus and also help several countries by providing these vaccines to them and that too without any precondition, unlike what China does,” the minister said while appreciating the effort done to combat the pandemic in the country. Asking the academicians to promote regional languages, the minister said that “the country does not hate English, but it does not mean that regional languages are neglected”. He also gave examples of different developed nations like Japan and China, wherein their major language is not English and yet they have developed so much. The minister also asked the varsity authorities to expedite the process for filling up the vacant teaching positions on the campus. “As the country marches ahead to become a world leader, AU should also play an important role in preparing its students to contribute in this direction.” Meanwhile, CEO of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and AU Chancellor Ashish Kumar Chauhan, in his address said he “is overwhelmed to be part of the AU”. He added it is an honour for him to be Chancellor of an institution which has contributed immensely in shaping the future of the country. Chauhan said that he would do anything to see to it that this great university continues to do the same in the future. He also expressed happiness over the fact that out of the 260 medals given to the students in the convocation, around 150 have been won by girl. AU vice-chancellor Prof Sangita Srivastava, in her address spoke about the development work done at AU and its academic achievements, including setting up of an Incubation Centre at the university.

As she cried out in horror, local traders, bus passengers waiting at the spot and policemen on duty ran out and caught the accused before he could flee. The incident was reported from the Behala tram depot area between 9.30pm and 9.45pm on Sunday, when the girl was returning home. The accused, Sudhir Majhi, a resident of Behala, was later arrested at the Behala police station. According to police, the victim had boarded an auto from Rashbehari to Behala. “The accused sat next to her in the auto. On the way, the accused kept trying to make eye-contact with her but the girl ignored him. But unfazed, the accused went ahead and tried to molest the girl a couple of times while travelling in the auto. The auto route terminated at the Behala tram depot and both the accused and the victim alighted. The victim soon realized that Majhi had started following her. As the victim wondered whether she should raise her voice or not, the accused suddenly flashed her. She immediately raised an alarm,” said an officer from the Behala division. The woman, said cops, often took the auto rickshaw to return home at night. “The victim has told us that this was the first time that she faced such an incident. We are trying to know from her and the auto operator whether the accused was warned by other passengers for his behaviour. We are also fining out if the accused is a habitual offender,” said the investigating officer. The police said they produced the accused in court and have sought court’s permission to record her statement before a magistrate. “We will also speak to the auto driver and get his evidence in this case. CCTV footage of the Behala and Rashbehari areas are also being studied,” said an officer from the Behala division.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/man-held-for-molesting-girl-in-auto-stalking-her/articleshow/87593300.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Call for special council to tackle stray dog menace||Thiruvananthapuram: BJP has called for another special council, seventh in last six months, over stray dog menace in the city. Mayor Arya Rajendran had denied permission for a discussion on the same topic during a general council meeting held in October. BJP councillors protested in the council hall with placards and slogans after permission was denied. It is in the backdrop of events in the General council meeting that 35 councillors of BJP have demanded a special council to be held on stray dog issue in the city. The health standing committee recently came under fire after animal lovers alleged mismanagement and lapses in handling stray dogs at the veterinary hospital, Thiruvallom. The animal welfare organisations had filed police complaints alleging that stray dogs undergoing sterilisation barely survived and were being housed in the most unhygienic conditions in cramped cages. Community feeders also came out in protest against corporation and said that they found many dogs missing in the cage of the hospital after dog catchers had picked the strays for sterilisation. Doubts are being cast over the survival rate of stray dogs post the surgery. Health standing committee and Mayor Arya Rajendran had reiterated that an advanced facility would be set up at Thiruvallom at a cost of Rs 4.5 crore. The civic body spent Rs 2.41 crore to sterilize Rs 12,715 dogs between 2016-17 and 2021-22, as per the latest figures presented in the assembly. Since 2016-17, the funds being spent on animal birth control have increased phenomenally, from Rs 8 lakh in 2016-17 to Rs 73 lakh in 2020-21. There has also been a proportionate increase in stray dogs being sterilised. Citizen initiative, a collective of animal lovers, said that reports had been coming in from community carers that the sick and starved dogs released had been dying horrible deaths in various parts of the city. Citizens who visited the centre had reported that very sick and emaciated dogs that were unfit to undergo surgery were being sterilised or awaiting sterilisation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/call-for-special-council-to-tackle-stray-dog-menace/articleshow/87593302.cms||---
---||Bareilly||People believe that BJP will lead state for another 50 yrs, says UP medical education minister||Shahjahanpur: Uttar Pradesh's (UP's) medical education minister, Suresh Khanna, on Monday claimed that people in the state have become weary of the Opposition parties -- whether it be the Indian National Congress, the Bahujan Samaj Party, or the Samajwadi Party -- and have placed their faith only in a government led by the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP). "People believe that only BJP will lead for another 50 years," he said. "(Chief minister) Yogi has given 500 animal ambulances to the state. The sign of a developed state is that the government cares for all -- whether it be humans or animals," he said. The chief minister is set to address two rallies in the district and inaugurate development work worth Rs 500 crore, including work on a sewer line, which will cost Rs 375 crore. Khanna is an eight-time member of the legislative assembly (MLA) from Shahjahanpur. He highlighted BJP's work in the district, ranging from declaring the area a municipal corporation to including over 41 villages on the Ganga Expressway. "Congress is busy making announcements in UP, without having done anything in Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan," the MLA said. On the surge in dengue cases, Khanna said, “We all have to stay cautious and ensure preventive measures. The government is providing treatment to patients but we have to take precautions and ensure that there is no water logging inside our house.” State minister Jitin Prasada, who recently joined BJP after leaving Congress, is looking after the arrangement for the chief minister's rally in Jalalabad. The CM is expected to make an announcement related to a Lord Parasurama temple during Tuesday’s rally. Jalalabad is believed to be the birthplace of the god and there are many ancient temples in the area. Jalalabad is the only constituency in Shahjahanpur district where the BJP failed to secure a win in 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/people-believe-that-bjp-will-lead-state-for-another-50-yrs-says-up-medical-education-minister/articleshow/87592549.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The four-year-old mare had gone missing on Friday. As many as three police teams had been deputed to find the mare after Khan had lodged an online complaint in the matter on Twitter and tagged officials concerned to take action.

---||Delhi||Govt orders hike in DA for unskilled and semi-skilled workers||New Delhi: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia issued an order to increase dearness allowance (DA) of unskilled, semi-skilled and other workers of Delhi on Monday. He said this will bring some relief to the working class facing the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and inflation. Delhi government said in a statement that thanks to the increased rate, the monthly salary of unskilled workers has increased from Rs 15,908 to Rs 16,064 and the monthly salary of semi-skilled workers has increased from Rs 17,537 to Rs 17,693. The monthly salary of skilled workers has been increased from Rs 19,291 to Rs 19,473, it said. Sisodia said in a statement that the step was taken keeping the interests of the poor and the working class during the pandemic in mind and clerical and supervisor class employees will also receive the benefit. He said that DA cannot be withheld for workers in the unorganised sector, who normally receive only minimum wages. He said that although the AAP government is cutting many expenses, it has decided to increase the DA of labourers, keeping their benefit in mind. Sisodia said that inflation and skyrocketing prices of commodities in the country has affected every section of the society. He said that with items like cereals, pulses and oil becoming expensive, the increase in wages will help the labourers. He said that the minimum wage paid to labourers in Delhi is the highest compared with any other state in the country and this is the second time in a year that Delhi government has increased DA for workers.  Delhi government has also launched a ‘shramik mitra’ scheme to enable construction workers of the city to receive benefits of government schemes. Sisodia said several government schemes are developed for the benefit of workers, but they remain unaware of these. He said around 800 shramik mitras will visit the homes of workers and help them apply for different assistance schemes of the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-orders-hike-in-da-for-unskilled-and-semi-skilled-workers/articleshow/87594027.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||With drones, ‘Med from Sky’ set to soar into newer areas in Telangana||HYDERABAD: In what began as a small experiment to deliver medicines through drones to sometimes inaccessible areas, the Telangana government’s ambitious ‘Medicine from the sky’ project is all set to soar into newer areas. So far, 350 drone flights delivered medicines to different locations in Vikarabad in little over a month, despite some of the locations being inaccessible. Vaccines, medicines and blood platelets were delivered by the drones to primary health centres (PHCs). With ‘Vikarabad experiment’ being a big success, officials said all the experience gained will be put to good use for drone delivery of medicines in Adilabad and Bhadradri Kothagudem districts. Rama Devi Lanka, director, Emerging Technologies, government of Telanana, said meticulous planning was done to implement the initiative, which was launched on September 11 by Union civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia. “The personnel were trained and the necessary permissions were obtained. The process was laborious. We went through it all abiding by DGCA rules and have been successful in the mission,” she told TOI. Rama Devi said officials were on tenterhooks initially. “However, no major incident happened during the entire period. This is laudable,” she said. The longest flight of a drone was 42 km. At the time of the official launch by Scindia, a parcel of 5 kg with vaccines was delivered in 10 minutes to a PHC 3 km away from Vikarabad. The ‘Medicines from the sky’ project was taken up in collaboration with World Economic Forum, Niti Aayog and Healthnet Global. Identifying the locations to where the medicines had to be sent was decided in consultation with collector K Nikhila. “At one place, the approach was not easy. Because of the condition of an old bridge, we deployed drones to deliver medicines there,” Rama Devi said. In Vikarabad, eight consortiums took part in initiative. Phase-2 of the project is being deliberated to include actual deliveries and use of hybrid vertical take-off and landing UAVs. Sources said the consortiums which participated in the first phase were eager for the launch of second phase. Operated by remote pilots, the drones can travel up to 10 km in a single run at a speed of 32 km per hour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/with-drones-med-from-sky-set-to-soar-into-newer-areas-in-state/articleshow/87594568.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

BJP continues to murder democracy and now is organising such events at the cost of the public exchequer. Chodankar stated that Goa speaker, who hosts the event, had allowed midnight dacoity of 10 MLAs from Congress and two from Maharashtra Gomantak Party. The GPCC chief said that BJP has also acted undemocratically when it stole away the mandate given to Congress by the people after the 2017 election. “In the democratic process, people had given their mandate to Congress but BJP stole it overnight.” Referring to the Women’s Parliament, Chodankar said that the leader of opposition was not given due respect at the event. He should have been prominently involved in the event but the entire event was hijacked by BJP to please their workers at taxpayers money, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-has-no-right-to-hold-events-on-democracy-congress/articleshow/87594044.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Kumbh Covid testing scam: Main accused Mallika and Sharat Pant arrested from Noida||HARIDWAR: A special investigation team (SIT) on Monday arrested Mallika and Sharat Pant, co-owners of Max Corporate Services, the firm accused of conducting over 1 lakh fake Covid tests during the Kumbh mela at Haridwar earlier this year. The Pants, who are main accused in the matter, had been evading arrest for the past few months and had been declared 'proclaimed offenders' by court. They were arrested early morning from their residence in sector 49, Noida. They had also applied for anticipatory bail over a week ago, but their plea was turned down by the Uttarakhand high court. A similar application filed by them in the sessions court had also been turned down earlier. The two were brought to Haridwar in the afternoon and remanded to judicial custody after being produced in front of a magistrate. Navtej Nalwa, director of Hisar-based Nalwa Laboratories and a co-accused in the matter, is still absconding. Haridwar police had registered a case in the multi-crore scam against Max Corporate Services, and the two firms it had outsourced some of the tests to -- Nalwa Laboratories and Delhi-based Dr Lalchandani Labs -- on June 17 under sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection), 420 (cheating), 468 ( forgery for cheating), 471 (using forged documents), and 120b (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC, along with Section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act and Section 53 of the Disaster Management Act. Subsequent investigation by the SIT constituted in the matter found evidence against Max Corporate Services and Nalwa Laboratories. Police has till now arrested Ashish Vashistha, owner of Delphia Labs in Bhiwani, Haryana, another path lab with whom Max Corporate Services had entered into an agreement to conduct the fake Covid tests. Senior superintendent of police of Haridwar, Yogendra Singh Rawat, refused to comment on whether Kumbh mela administration and district health officials will also be named in the case. He added that “the investigation is ongoing and at least five more arrests are likely to be made in the case soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kumbh-covid-testing-scam-main-accused-mallika-and-sharat-pant-arrested-from-noida/articleshow/87593321.cms||MS Nawaz

Not only we had provided free treatment and foodgrain to the people, but also vaccinated everyone free of cost,” said Yogi addressing a public rally in UP’s Rampur on Monday. According to a Government of India portal (mygov.in), UP has, so far, reported 17,10,204 Covid-19 cases and 22,903 deaths, while 16,87,216 people have been cured since the outbreak. Stating that "it never used to happen before", Yogi took a dig at the opposition party, saying, “Everyone saw that a leader of the opposition party during the Covid wave was so afraid that he didn’t step out of his house, even to meet his party members in need. People who are so scared of disease can’t fight for the nation.” Meanwhile, reminding people how his government came down heavily on criminals, the CM said, “The empires of mafia and gangsters were bulldozed and action was taken against everyone who attempted to breach the peace in the state. It doesn’t matter who they are, people encroaching upon the land of innocent citizens will have to face the music.” In a veiled attack on local SP MP Azam Khan, Yogi said, “There is no discrimination in providing the benefits of various beneficiary schemes, but no one will be allowed to breach the peace and security of the country. In Rampur, the action was taken against 147 land mafia and 640 hectares was evicted from their clutches.” “Besides, 2.64 lakh farmers from Rampur have been benefitted under the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana and more than 64,000 farmers have been benefited under the loan waiver scheme. The farmers in this region are extremely hardworking and efficient. The government has ensured timely payments for wheat, paddy and sugarcane crops. The government is also planning to renovate a sugar mill here,” said Yogi in Rampur, where a youth participating in the R-Day farmers’ protest in Delhi was allegedly died in police action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/ups-covid-19-management-best-in-world-says-yogi-adityanath/articleshow/87592580.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Divisional commissioner, Deepak Agrawal said following administrative and financial approval of the Rs 269.10 crores project for widening of SH-87 and issuance of GO, the PWD has floated tender for the works. The state government had already allocated Rs 50 crores for this project in 2021-22 budget. The agency has been asked to get technical approval as per the prescribed guidelines and start the works at earliest, he added. Though six-lane national highway-2 keeps Gopiganj directly connected with Varanasi, Bhadohi, the carpet city which was separated from Varanasi in 1994, had no such world class road connectivity with Varanasi. To give better connectivity to Bhadohi with Varanasi, the PWD had forwarded an estimate including about Rs 162 crores for road construction, Rs 100 crores for land acquisition and also the costs of tree cutting, shifting of poles, transformers and religious structures, said officials. The 32-km Varanasi-Gopiganj road via Bhadohi was also connected with recently inaugurated Ring-road phase-II package-I, said commissioner adding that the four-lane SH-87 will not only help in smooth transportation of the consignments of carpet for export via Varanasi but also encourage the buyers including foreigners to visit the carpet belt frequently. Apart from this, traffic of passenger vehicles is also very heavy on this two-lane road and the four-lane conversion of this road will ease the traffic on this road, which has many densely populated areas along it. Following these developments, the possibility of upgradation of Varanasi-Chandauli, which was also separated from Varanasi in 1997 into a six-lane road, has also increased. Along with the estimate of SH-87 projects, the PWD officials had also forwarded an estimate of Rs 416 crores for converting the road between Mohansarai and Chakia in Chandauli district via Varanasi (Cantonment) railway station and DDU Nagar (Mughalsarai) into 6-lane road. The officials said approval to this project by state government was awaited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/pwd-intensifies-efforts-to-upgrade-sh-87-into-4-lane/articleshow/87593333.cms||---

---||Kolkata||CBSE X, XII students stuck outside can take first-sem exams from other cities||Kolkata: Class X and XII CBSE students, who will appear for their first-semester exams later this month but are stuck in other cities in the pandemic, can apply for a change of venue by Wednesday. CBSE sent a circular to its schools on Monday, saying the schools will forward the applications to the board latest by Friday. But the circular made it clear that candidates applying for a change in venue would have to appear for their practical exams in the changed venue. No candidate will be allowed to write their theory and practical exams at two different venues. Since the practicals will be internally assessed, most students thought it would be comfortable to take them from own schools. Parents will have to apply to the respective schools, explaining the reason behind their wards failing to appear for the tests from their schools and will have to provide their present addresses. The board would then allot exams centres closest to the candidates’ present addresses, the circular said. Marks for practical exams would be uploaded from where the student would take the practical exams, the circular said. Quite a few students from Kolkata schools have been attending online classes from other cities. Schools said they would be informed on Tuesday about the circular so that their parents could apply for the change in venue. But some students are reportedly stuck in places, like London, where the CBSE does not have a venue. One such student is from Lakshmipat Singhania Academy. “There is no centre in London and so, he has to come back. I will see on Tuesday if anyone else is still outside,” said director Meena Kak. DPS Ruby Park has a few students, whose parents stuck outside are unwilling to travel right now for the exams. “We will ask them to apply by Wednesday,” said vice-principal Indrani Chattopadhyay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cbse-x-xii-students-stuck-outside-can-take-first-sem-exams-from-other-cities/articleshow/87593328.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Hyderabad||Two held for duping former Union minister T Subbarami Reddy’s wife of 32.5L shares||HYDERABAD: A team of central crime station (CCS) personnel has arrested two directors of a Mumbai-based finance company for disposing off 32.50 lakh shares belonging to a firm owned by the wife of former Union minister T Subbarami Reddy. Police said based on a complaint by T Indira Reddy, chairperson of Gayatri Projects Limited (GPL), Chetan Balubai Patel and Harshawardhan Avinash Pradhan, both directors of Mumbai-based Champion Finsec Limited (CFL), were picked up by Hyderabad police for cheating GPL. The accused had sold the GPL shares in the open market on the pretext of providing loan to GPL. CCS officials said that in June this year, CFL approached Indira Reddy’s GPL, an infrastructure and highway development company, offering them a loan on a commission of 1 per cent. Trusting CFL authorities, GPL decided to take a loan of Rs 11.50 crore by pledging 69.63 lakh shares, but eventually settled for 32.50 lakh shares. They signed a master loan agreement and its proportional amount of loan as per GPL’s prevailing share value. But with CFL failing to transfer the loan amount, GPL management got suspicious about the Mumbai firm. “As per the terms of the agreement, the loan amount in proportion to the shares pledged was to be transferred to GPL account on or before July 12, 2021. But CFL has not even transferred any loan amount to GPL account and further it was found that on July 8, 2021, CFL illegally invoked the pledged shares and sold them in open market,” joint commissioner of police (CCS) Avinash Mohanty said. The accused allegedly sold these shares between July 8 and July 13. These shares were earlier pledged by transferring them into the demat account of CFL. Patel and Pradhan were arrested under sections 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) of IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/2-held-for-duping-tsrs-wife-of-32-5l-shares/articleshow/87594587.cms||---

According to officials, it appears that the girl’s mother has lodged a false complaint against her husband due to marital issues and CWC claimed that lately they have been getting similar cases due to which children are suffering by being dragged in between couple’s discords. The girl was initially sent to live with her maternal grandmother, but she ran away from there after being beaten following which she was accommodated at the children shelter. CWC member Satyapal Chandolia said, “The girl’s mother lodged an FIR at Jhotwara police station around a month ago following which we kept her at the children’s shelter. After the family promised to take care of her, she was sent to live with the maternal grandmother in Chomu where she was apparently beaten up following which she ran away. Although the case is under police investigation, the girl said her father had not sexually assaulted her.” The CWC as an interim order sent her to her paternal grandmother so that her education is not affected adversely as her exams are forthcoming. “Lately, we have seen that in lot of cases where children are brought to us under similar circumstances, parents use the minors to lodge police complaints which turn out to be false. This is not only bad for the parents but also for the children who have to suffer in education as well as mental trauma”, added the official. Officials claimed that the girl could neither be sent to live with the father cause of the allegations against him which are still under investigation nor to the mother because of her complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/minor-girl-suffers-after-mother-alleges-father-of-molesting-their-daughter/articleshow/87594058.cms||---

---||Kolkata||De-reserved UG seats opened up in 3rd round||Kolkata: The extension of undergraduate admission deadline to November 26 came as an opportunity for some colleges that had applied for de-reservation of seats but had received the go-ahead hours before the October 8 deadline for the earlier round had expired. Now that a new round of admissions has been allowed, they can now open up the reserved seats to all. Many colleges have issued the schedule for filling these seats. “We had some seats vacant in the reserved category and we had applied for de-reservation. But the go-ahead for de-reservation had arrived on the afternoon of October 8, which was the last date of admission in the last round. So some of those de-reserved seats remained vacant and we might fill them up now,” said Maulana Azad College principal Subhasis Dutta. At colleges and universities, 45% seats are reserved for students belonging to SC, ST, OBC A and B categories. The West Bengal State Higher Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act, 2013, allows de-reservation of those seats, if they remain vacant despite several notifications, with the consent of the backward classes welfare department. Even for Umesh Chandra College, the de-reservation nod arrived on October 8. “ Since the approval arrived on October 8, we could not open up those seats as admissions in the previous round had ended on that day,” said principal Mohammad Tofazzal Haque. Many colleges have also planned to start fresh admissions by this week. At Scottish Church College, applications can be submitted from November 8 to 10 and the merit list will be published on November 11. Principal Madhumanjari Mandal said, “We are receiving fresh applications for all subjects.” Principal of New Alipore College Jaydeep Sarangi said, “We are getting applications for subjects, like Bengali, maths, Sanskrit and philosophy. I think it’s an opportunity for students to shift to subjects of their choice.” Seth Anandram Jaipuria principal Ashok Mukhopadhyay said, “We are following a wish-list format for the fresh admissions right now. If required, we may take applications as per government notification.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/de-reserved-ug-seats-opened-up-in-3rd-round/articleshow/87593340.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Party national spokesperson Alka Lamba demanded an apology from Rai and PM Narendra Modi for maligning Singh and Congress. “We are giving BJP another chance to prove the allegations levelled against Congress and Manmohan Singh. If BJP can prove it, we will step back from the elections,” Lamba told reporters. Rai, in a sworn affidavit dated October 28, tendered an unconditional apology to former Congress MP Sanjay Nirupam. Rai, who authored a CAG report that alleged a presumptive loss of Rs 1.76 lakh crore in the allocation of 2G spectrum, had claimed that Nirupam pressured him to keep Singh’s name out of the 2G spectrum case. “In the last seven years, the Modi government has not been able to prove any of the allegations levelled against Congress,” said Lamba. “This was a well-planned and orchestrated plan to tarnish the reputation of former PM Manmohan Singh. This was a conspiracy to destabilise the Congress government.” Based on the CAG report, CBI had filed a chargesheet, but special judge O P Saini in his 1,522 pages judgment in the 2G spectrum case concluded that the prosecution “miserably failed to prove any charge” against the accused and Congress MPs. “The report was a figment of imagination and a flight of fancy. Only India lost. Let Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Vinod Rai and all others tender an unconditional apology to the nation and admit to their sinister role,” Lamba said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-shun-polls-if-bjp-can-prove-2g-spectrum-allegations-cong/articleshow/87594073.cms||---

Chikky Pandey, actor Chunkey Pandey’s brother, whom one of the witnesses in the cruise drug bust case K P Gosavi had contacted to get in touch with Dadlani, also failed to turn up before the SIT, citing Covid-19. Pandey reportedly helped Gosavi to get in touch with Dadlani, sources said. The SIT was constituted by Mumbai police after Prabhakar Sail, personal bodyguard of Gosavi, filed a complaint with the MRA Marg police. Sail had alleged that he had overheard Gosavi talking over the phone to one Sam D’Souza about extorting money in the drug case and a Rs 8 crore payment to be made to NCB zonal chief Sameer Wankhede. Later, three more applications on similar lines were submitted to tMRA Marg police. D’Souza claimed Dadlani paid Rs 50 lakh but the money was returned after they realised Gosavi, who promised to prevent the arrest of Khan’s son Aryan, was a cheat. ACP Milind Khetle (Azad Maidan division) has been leading the SIT probe and will submit his report to the police commissioner. The SIT has so far recorded statements of 15 people and is likely to summon more people. Statements of Sail, hotelier Ranjitsingh Bindra and one Mayur Ghule have been recorded. One Sunil Patil appeared before the Mumbai police’s SIT on Sunday evening to give his statement. The SIT also recorded the statement of another person, Vijay Pagare, who claimed to be privy to pre-raid discussions and told the city police that Aryan was framed by certain individuals to make money. Meanwhile, two different inquiries are being carried out in Mumbai’s north region by the city police. One inquiry is into an application about Sameer Wankhede’s marriage certificate (’nikahnama’). The National Scheduled Castes Commission led by Vijay Sapla last week asked Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale to probe into the complaint of defamation lodged by Wankhede against NCP minister Nawab Malik, who raised questions about the officer’s caste credentials. An inquiry into it is also on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-srk-manager-fails-to-turn-up-before-city-polices-sit/articleshow/87594061.cms||Mateen Hafeez

Holding an unprecedented second press conference in two days, he said the BJP uses the Income Tax department and Enforcement Directorate (ED) to scare detractors but he was not afraid of them. He also announced that TRS would hold protests in every village on Friday demanding that the Centre procure paddy from the state in next Yasangi (Rabi) season. He called on farmers to grill BJP leaders when they come to their villages. The Centre has said that it will nor procure boiled rice from Telangana and that it would pick up only raw paddy. KCR has started attacking BJP both at the Centre and in the state after TRS lost the Huzurabad by-election to former state minister and TRS rebel Eatala Rajender. BJP is seeing the win as an opportunity to gain a firmer foothold in the state ahead of the assembly elections in 2023 and has been directly attacking the chief minister on a number of issues. “Is it wrong to support farmers who are protesting against the new farms laws? Is it an offence to express concern saying every inch of our land should be protected from China’s aggression at the borders?” KCR asked at a press conference. “Meghalaya governor Satya Pal Malik and (BJP MP) Varun Gandhi also spoke in support of farmers. Are they traitors? “It is an established fact that central agencies raid specific people, who talk against Modi government, he added. “I am not scared of raids as I am not a thief. I have been giving details of all my properties in election affidavits. You (BJP) should remember that you are taking on KCR, who is a warrior. The same KCR was not anti-national when TRS supported BJP in the presidential election and on many bills in Parliament.” He vowed to continue to fight against the farm laws and till the Centre announces that it would procure paddy from Telangana on the lines of Punjab. He also wants central cess on petrol and diesel slashed. A couple of hours after BJP state president Bandi Sanjay and other BJP leaders told reporters that KCR was an anti-national, the chief minister said, “BJP leaders are spreading lies, claiming that I am hiding black money in China. BJP survives on lies. They say sheep and buffalo distribution schemes are being implemented in the state with the Centre’s financial help. It is totally false. The scheme is being implemented with with money borrowed from financial institutions.” ‘Bandi can be my tractor driver’Sharply reacting to Telangana BJP chief Bandi Sanjay’s remark that he would plough through KCR’s farmhouse at Erravelli, the chief minister said he purchased the land and had been farming there several years. “Is he (Bandi) wants to work as tractor driver in my fields, he is welcome” KCR said satirically.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-brands-all-its-critics-as-traitors-kcr/articleshow/87594607.cms||Koride Mahesh

The residents of the economically weaker section (EWS) colony were upset with the civic officials as their drainage and water connection were disconnected. The water supply and drainage lines were disconnected as the residents had refused to evacuate the buildings which were in dilapidated condition. On Monday, when the team of about 15 SMC staffers with a squad of state reserve police (SRP) reached the spot where the leakage was, the locals pelted stones at them and broke glass of the earth mover. “Our staff had to face a life-threatening situation and we did not get help from the police on time. Around 150 people attacked us,” said SMC official of the Udhna zone. “It is possible that after disconnecting the pipelines, capping was not done properly due to which the leakage was happening,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/smc-team-attacked-in-bhestan/articleshow/87593363.cms||---

Two other centres—NSI, Kalyanpur and FTI Kidwai Nagar also indicated a very poor air quality index which was 362 and 370. According to scientists, the AQI between zero and 50 is considered good, 51 to 100 is satisfactory, 101 to 200 is moderate, 201 to 300 is considered as poor and 301 to 400 is marked as very poor while 401 to 500 is severe. Kanpur’s AQI is floating between very poor to severe, say the reports. The report of Nehru Nagar Centre stated that at 10 pm on Sunday, PM2.5 and PM10 both had entered into the severe zone of AQI and continued till 12 O'clock. Later, it improved a little and shifted to the very poor zone. The severe zone indicates that it would affect even healthy people and seriously impacts those suffering from various ailments. In such conditions people could face respiratory illness after prolonged exposure. The System of Air Quality and Weather and Research has pointed out that bursting of firecrackers and change of wind direction are the two main reasons for the high level of pollution. ON the one hand the toxic smoke had very badly polluted the air quality after the Deepawali festival while on the other hand burning of stubble also enhanced the carbon content in the air quality. The average value of gases recorded by Nehru Nagar is: NO2 (116), SO (30), CO (68) and Ozone (19). All these values are high and not good for human health. Dr SN Shukla has suggested that people should use N-95 masks whenever they go out, especially in the morning and avoid early morning walk as it would be harmful. Use of turmeric, ginger, clove, black pepper and mulethi would give relief in respiratory problems. They may also use ‘Trikuta’ manufactured by several ayurvedic drug companies, Dr Shukla further said. Use of lukewarm water also helps in respiratory problems, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/experts-advise-caution-as-citys-aqi-rises/articleshow/87593352.cms||Anant Shekher Misra

---||Kolkata||Luggage goes missing as snag hits conveyor belt in Kol airport||Kolkata: The baggage system at Kolkata airport failed for 30 minutes on Sunday morning, causing inconvenience to the departing passengers, especially the IndiGo flyers. Many passengers found their registered luggage missing on arrival at the destination airport. The volume of passengers at the airport was very high on Sunday (more than 48,000 passengers in 334 domestic flights) due to the festive season as many people were returning to their workplaces after spending Kali Puja, Diwali and Bhai Phonta in Kolkata last week. An airport official said the snag in the baggage conveyor belt had lasted for around 30 minutes during the morning peak hour, leading to problems in despatching the passengers’ baggage to the aircraft. “The conveyor belt that transports bags from the check-in desks through the inline baggage screening system (ILBS) before they are loaded onto the respective aircraft developed a snag for around half an hour. However, since there was a rush, bags were piled up quickly. The backlog took some time to clear,” said the official. The baggage belt is around half kilometer long, the official added. Irate passengers took to Twitter and expressed their angst, demanding that the authorities trace their baggage immediately. “I was travelling from Trivandrum airport on 06/11/21 to Hyderabad to Kolkata to Darbhanga on 07/11, PNR No-###### flight No 6E335,6E165, 6E 325, my check in bag is missing. Ur team is unable to trace,” wrote a flier, Keshav Jha. Another flyer, Souvik Chanda wrote on Monday: “@IndiGo6E, it’s been 8 hours and I am still waiting for my bags which went missing due to belt failure at Kolkata airport. How come it has happened only with few people? And when am I receiving them as it was due to come by last flight to Mumbai. can life saver medicines wait?” IndiGo issued an apology, blaming the baggage belt failure for the hassle. The snag at Kolkata airport comes exactly a week after a similar snag had happened at Bengaluru airport on October 31.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/luggage-goes-missing-as-snag-hits-conveyor-belt-in-kol-airport/articleshow/87593367.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Patna||Prohibition a public matter, not my private concern: CM Nitish Kumar||PATNA: Hitting back at the opposition leaders for issuing different statements over the death of people in the recent hooch tragedies in the state, chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday said the issue of prohibition was a public matter and all political parties should work unitedly for the enforcement of total prohibition in the state. “We (all political parties) unitedly decided to enforce total prohibition in the state. But these days, it deeply pains me when some people issue different sorts of statements. Why do you issue only statements? Why do you not get the wrong people caught? If something wrong is happening somewhere, give information about it to the proper authorities,” Nitish said without taking the name of any opposition leader, while responding to a media query after his ‘janata darbar’ programme. “When the Bill related to the total prohibition was passed, people of all political parties unitedly supported it in the assembly and also in the legislative council. If you feel that someone is committing wrong, please inform the authorities/government. Some people just issue statements in the newspapers that they have written to the CM. What have you written to the CM? All people have to cooperate in this matter because legislators of all parties were together in the House and had taken pledge in favour of the prohibition. The political parties which were in power those days and those who were not in power, all had supported the probation laws. All proposals related to prohibition were passed unanimously,” Nitish said while responding to a query over the enforcement of prohibition. The CM also said that people in the opposition were today indulging in only issuing statements in the media. “All people would have to work unitedly on the issue of enforcement of prohibition. It is not my private concern, it is a public issue. It is in the interest of all,” Nitish said. Nitish added he would hold a “detailed review meeting” over prohibition on November 16 after the Chhath festival. “I will review as to how many complaints came, how many were taken up, what actions were taken and what was the result of those actions. I have already asked the DGP and senior officials that I will review everything from each district,” the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/prohibition-a-public-matter-not-my-private-concern-cm/articleshow/87592734.cms||Madan Kumar

---||Jodhpur||Demoiselle cranes vaxxed in Jodhpur||JAIPUR: For the first time in Rajasthan, demoiselle cranes have been vaccinated in Khichan village in Phalodi tehsil against Ranikhet (Newcastle) disease, suspected to be spreading rapidly among migratory birds. Over the past three days, more than 80 demoiselle cranes were found dead, purportedly from the disease, in Jodhpur region. Though no deaths have been reported at the Khichan Bird Sanctuary, the animal husbandry, forest department and locals have started a week-long vaccination drive as a precautionary measure. Bhagirath Soni, veterinary officer, said the animal husbandry department started the vaccination drive on Monday. The vaccine is sprayed on the feed (barley) provided to these cranes in the feeding area. Also, it is given to these birds with the drinking water. “These migratory birds are vaccinated using Lasota strain vaccine. Due to Diwali, only small flocks were present as they were disturbed by fire-crackers. We will intensify our drive after these migratory birds start returning to the feeding area,” Soni said. Experts said Ranikhet was highly contagious and often a fatal viral disease for birds caused by a paramyxovirus. Young birds are more susceptible to the disease than adults. It is characterised by respiratory problems, torticollis (twisting of neck), paralysis of legs and wings. International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) member Dau Lal Bohra said, “The forest department should closely monitor the situation in nearby areas as the disease can be transmitted through infected migratory birds. As it is an airborne virus, it is able to spread extremely quickly, especially in poultry farms where there are thousands of chickens in close proximity.” These migratory birds from colder regions of Eurasia fly to India in October and roost in various places in the state till March in large numbers. According to Sevaram, a caretaker at the sanctuary, there are over 15,000 demoiselle cranes in the surrounding areas of Khichan and the number is expected to increase by mid-November.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/demoiselle-cranes-vaxxed-in-jodhpur/articleshow/87600179.cms||---

He said that during preliminary investigations it came to fore that inmate Shivam had died due to bullet injuries. “A committee of three senior officers of jail administration has been formed to probe the incident leading to the death of inmate Shivam. Firm action will be taken against whoever is guilty as soon as the inquiry report comes. It would be investigated as to how the bullet and the firearm reached inside the jail and who shot the prisoner,” said Kumar while talking to reporters outside the Fatehgarh jail. The police had earlier claimed that Shivam had suffered injuries in his stomach and lost his life while being taken to a hospital on Sunday. However, in a purported video which went viral on social media, Shivam had himself claimed before his death that he suffered a bullet injury. The report of the autopsy, conducted on Sunday night, however, stated that the bore of the bullet is yet to be ascertained. Divisional commissioner Kanpur, Raj Shekhar, meanwhile said the government is being briefed about the entire matter. The cremation of Shivam was performed on the banks of Ramganga river in his native village Jainapur on Monday. Initially, Shivam’s family members refused to cremate his body and demanded authorities to first register a case against those responsible for his death. After two and a half hours of persuasion, the last rites were performed amid tight police security. An FIR has been lodged by the jailor of the Fatehgarh jail, Akhilesh Kumar against 27 named and several unidentified inmates, accusing them of causing arson, sabotage and assault inside the jail on Sunday morning, at the Kotwali police station. The jailor has stated in the complaint that on Sunday at around 8 am, he along with deputy jailor Shailesh Kumar Singh Sonkar was sitting at the office of District Prison, Fatehgarh. Suddenly, the prisoners indulged in arson and vandalism by spreading rumours of death due to lack of treatment of an inmate, Sandeep Yadav, undergoing treatment at Saifai in Etawah. When he resisted, the prisoners abused him and caught hold of him. Somehow, when he rescued himself and tried to escape, they chased him with the intention of killing him. Later, they manhandled him and snatched his official mobile phone. Thereafter, the prisoners damaged the office gate, CCTV cameras, RO plant, trolley, chair and tables and sensitive cell of barrack-1. They also set afire the batteries installed in RO plant, which led to a loud explosion and which caused huge monetary loss. Due to mutual factional fighting, there was a scuffle between the groups of prisoners and in Barrack No.-2, one prisoner was seriously injured. To recall, a prisoner in Fatehgarh district jail in Farrukhabad had died and 30 police officers were injured on Sunday during a protest by inmates that turned violent. Prisoners in the jail were protesting against the death of a fellow inmate, allegedly because of negligence of the prison staff. However, the police claimed that the said inmate, Sandeep Yadav, died on Saturday evening at a hospital during the treatment for dengue. Several other prisoners began to protest outside their barracks after they came to know about Yadav’s death on Sunday morning. They allegedly attacked jail officials while they were serving them breakfast and also allegedly indulged in arson in the jail. The police force then managed to control the situation. In this, 30 policemen were injured, and the deputy jailor, too, was attacked by the inmates. Shivam allegedly sustained stomach injuries during the violence. He was admitted to the district hospital, but died during treatment. “A judicial inquiry will be conducted into the death of Sandeep Yadav, who died during treatment in hospital,” said Farrukhabad district magistrate Sanjay Kumar Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/dg-prisons-visits-fatehgarh-jail-assures-firm-action-after-inquiry/articleshow/87593366.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

If there is no respite, the count may cross the five-year high.According to the health department report, the number of dengue cases was 1,439 in Ludhiana till November 8. There were 1,355 cases the previous year. In the past seven years, the case count was the highest (1,876) in 2015 and the second highest (1,509) in 2019. A health department official said, “Twenty-seven cases were logged on Monday. There are chances that this year’s case count may cross the 2019’s figure.” There are 3,540 suspected cases in the district.This season saw four suspected dengue deaths. The number of confirmed deaths will be known after the review meetings at district and state level.In 2015, the highest number of dengue deaths (seven) were reported. There were no confirmed deaths in 2019.The department officials said lesser number of dengue cases was reported last year because of higher number of Covid cases.Civil surgeon Dr S P Singh said, “Last year, people didn’t report and got themselves tested for dengue as more Covid cases were coming. I feel the number was more than the reported last year. Dengue cases are reported in October and November. We destroy the larvae during checking of houses and other places. Fogging is done by the department concerned to destroy adult mosquitoes.”Experts said there were multiple reasons for more cases this year.Ludhiana IMA former president Dr Narrotam Dewan said, “The government should have got the ditches, created due to development work on roadsides, filled as they become breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Weather could also be a factor, as there was more rain this year, which leads to water accumulation.”“On the pattern of national malaria control programme, there should be a project to contain dengue too. Vaccine for dengue should be developed as soon as possible to check deaths due to the disease,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/dengue-cases-in-district-surpass-last-years-count/articleshow/87592610.cms||Shariq Majeed

They not only live in unhygienic conditions, but are also vulnerable to road mishaps.Areas like Rakh Bagh, outside Guru Nanak Stadium, Durga Mata Temple, Jagraon Bridge and Bharat Nagar Chowk are dotted with homeless people living on roadsides. Teja Singh Dhaliwal, senior vice-president of Basketball Federation of India who is also the general secretary of Punjab Basketball Association, said, “Several homeless people have been living outside Guru Nanak Stadium for a long time now. The right lane adjoining the stadium, which leads to the basketball court, witnesses lesser traffic flow. So these homeless people stay there. Since there is no public toilet nearby, they soil the surroundings. At times, it becomes difficult to even pass through the area.”Dhaliwal said, “I have visited many cities of India, but have never seen so many people living on pavements and road medians. Dugra Mata Temple is near the stadium, so devotees distribute them langar. I want to request the administration to shift them to shelter homes and people can provide them food there.”These poor people become vulnerable to accidents too. Maharaj Nagar resident Amit Modgil said, “I was passing by the bus stand flyover a few days ago in my car when a homeless man sleeping on the median suddenly turned his legs on the road. I slammed the brakes in panic.”Ritu Jain of Urban Estate said, “On Jagraon Bridge, pavements are full of the homeless, making it difficult for people to walk. I don’t understand why the administration is not helping them when there are shelter homes in the city. These homes should remain open throughout the year. The municipal corporation usually opens shelter homes in winter.” Deputy commissioner of police (law and order) SPS Dhindsa said they are starting a drive against the beggars and it will include the homeless also. “Verification of homeless people will also be done,” he added. Why are night shelters only for winter?Senior deputy mayor Shyam Sunder Malhotra said, “In winter months, homeless people need to be saved from extreme cold, so we open the night shelters. Besides, the government directions are only for winter.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/homeless-dot-roadsides-pavements-need-shelter/articleshow/87592604.cms||Payal Dhawan

Addressing a Jat community programme in Jaipur on Sunday, Malik had said that so far 600 people have been martyred in the farmers’ movement. Even if an animal dies, a condolence message from the leaders in Delhi is sent. “But 600 of our farmers were martyred, no leader spoke on them,” he said, targeting the Centre. Malik’s statement, taking a dig at the Centre, on the farmers’ agitation, gave the Congress a golden chance. While praising Malik, Congressmen have targeted the central government. Transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas and Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi have termed Malik’s statement as the ‘voice of conscience’. Chief whip Joshi said, “I am happy that despite holding a constitutional post, his conscience is still alive. If a person sitting on a constitutional post says something, it has a lot of meaning. He says such a thing by putting his position at stake. I welcome Satya Pal Malik and congratulate him that he did not let his conscience die. It is a fact that the PM and no BJP leader expressed sympathy towards even a single farmer. This is an inhuman act. The Centre should still learn a lesson. Do justice to the farmers. Government should take decisions in favour of farmers after talking to them,” he said. Transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas, joining the issue praised Malik. “I want to congratulate the governor of Meghalaya, Satya Pal Malik. The governor who goes ahead and accepts the truth, speaks the voice of truth, should be respected. He has rightly said that the farmer of the country is dying, and the central government is insensitive. Governments, prime ministers and chief ministers keep changing, but humanity should not end. Malik has raised the voice of the farmers of the country. Now the governor appointed by the Centre has also come in support of the farmers. The central government should leave the arrogance and take back the black law after listening to the voice of the farmers,” he said. Country still facing brunt of demonetisation: Pilot Congress leader and former Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot on Monday targeted the central government over demonetisation and said the country is still facing its brunt. He said the people will not tolerate the government which loots their hard-earned money. “The country is still facing the brunt of demonetisation by the central government. This unplanned decision worked to destroy the small-medium industry, employment, income and economy of the country,” Pilot tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cong-supports-meghalaya-guvs-stand-on-farm-laws/articleshow/87594076.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Tirade indicates we are main opponent now, says BJP||HYDERABAD: Not just the emphatic win in Huzurabad, the BJP believes it has got the much-needed leverage now against the TRS going by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s tirade on Sunday and Monday. While the mood in the BJP camp is upbeat after the bypoll victory, senior party leaders said the fact that they have succeeded in making the TRS openly declare the BJP as its main opponent in Telangana in itself was a victory for the party. A wary BJP is also debating if the Hindutva card should be played now or a more balanced approach is the need of the hour. In the recent hard-fought bypoll in Huzurabad, the TRS’s style of governance was used as a stick to beat the ruling party with. Former BJP spokesperson NV Subhash said, “In a chess game, once all ministers and pawns are vanquished, the king enters the game. Similarly, after the BJP’s rise, the CM realised that his forces could not defeat us and expressed his displeasure.” “KTR claimed before the Huzurabad by-election that winning or losing is not of any significance to them. But, the scenario has completely changed now. They (TRS) cannot ignore us. The lotus is blooming in Telangana. We are pumped up to take on the TRS,” a party leader said. Apart from being energised by the Huzurabad win and CM’s attack on Sanjay, the saffron party is also actively considering various options on how to take on TRS. In Huzurabad, the BJP deliberately did not rake up Hindutva. “But, we cannot neglect our voters in other parts of the state. There will undoubtedly be a balanced play in the coming days with greater clarity during party president Sanjay’s second phase of Praja Sangrama padayatra,” the party leader said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tirade-indicates-we-are-main-oppn-now-bjp/articleshow/87594609.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

They said the decision pertaining rates are mutually agreed by the hospitals and the insurance companies while their task is simply to service the clients. However, they agreed that TPAs are part of the meeting to fix modalities and service agreements.Countering the claim, VHA said the notices to discontinue cashless facility have been issued by TPAs only. “How are their aloof from the price fixing process when they have the powers to discontinue cashless mechanism,” the VHA asked.VHA warned that such acts would lead to poor quality and lesser choice of services to beneficiaries who too have been allegedly “cheated” by not getting due intimation about discontinuing of services.VHA has demanded that TPAs withdraw the decisions taken through the alleged cartel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hosps-cry-foul-over-insurance-rate-cut-freezing-of-cashless-facility/articleshow/87629131.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Vadodara||Vadodara: Congress to boycott metropolitan committee polls||VADODARA: The opposition Congress in the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) has decided to boycott the polls for 30 seats of the Metropolitan Planning Committee of the city calling it a farce. The polls for the committee were scheduled to be held on November 25, but will not be needed anymore as BJP corporators will win uncontested. Corporators can contest in the polls for the seat in committee and vote too. While Congress may have decided to boycott the polls, it stood no chance of winning a single seat. The VMC has 69 BJP corporators and only seven from the Congress. Leader of Congress in VMC, Ami Ravat stated that the polls were held by the civic body last time after a high court order. She added that not a single meeting of the last committee was held. She called the polls farcical and said that there was no point in electing a committee that was not functional. Apart from the 30 elected members, the committee has 15 members that include government nominated members and experts. The BJP has already filed nominations for the 30 members. The forms will be scrutinised on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/cong-to-boycott-metropolitan-committee-polls/articleshow/87593382.cms||---
---||Jodhpur||Rajasthan earns more than Centre on per litre petrol||JAIPUR: Rajasthan is perhaps the only state in the country which earns more tax revenue from petrol per litre than the Centre. As per calculations, the state gets Rs 30.69 as taxes on petrol compared to Centre’s Rs 27.98. While the state gets Rs 2.71 more on petrol, it is almost the same for diesel. High taxes in the state have shifted demand to neighbouring states with small states like Punjab and Haryana selling more fuel than Rajasthan. Rajendra Singh Bhati, president of state VAT steering committee of Rajasthan Petroleum Dealers’ Association, said, “Despite being very small states and having far fewer fuel stations, Punjab and Haryana sold more fuel than Rajasthan.” “By imposing high taxes on its people, the state government is not gaining,” Bhati added. He said Punjab has over 3,300 fuel stations and Haryana a similar number compared to Rajasthan’s 5,667. But Punjab sold 55 lakh kilo litres of fuels last year compared to Rajasthan’s 39 lakh kilo litres. Rajasthan’s sales volume was even lower than Haryana’s 45 lakh kilo litre during the last financial year, he said. In fact, Rajasthan sold nine lakh kilo litres less in the last financial year compared to 2019-20. The worst hit in the state have been the border districts in divisions like Jodhpur, Bikaner, Alwar and Bharatpur. “Nearly 1,200 fuel stations in 17 districts bordering Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat are facing an uncertain future. We used to sell 3,000 litres a day two years ago. That has now come down to 300 litres,” said Ashutosh Gupta, Sriganganagar district president of Rajasthan Petroleum Dealers’ Association. He said the government should bring down fuel rates in border districts at par with neighbouring states so that vehicles keep refuelling here. “At least, the government should try with one district and see if the sales volume is rising or not. Similarly, it can also assess if the tax revenue is increasing or not by reducing rates. If it works, they should replicate the model in more districts.” Meanwhile, Deepak Saharan, a resident of Sriganganagar, said that the big rate variance has increased illegal trade in the border districts. “People load drums in tractors and go to Punjab and Haryana to buy petrol and diesel and sell in border districts of Rajasthan. It is a new trade for many now. The government has to curb the illegal trade by bringing down prices,” Saharan said. Even the farmers in the region are buying from nearby fuel stations in other states. “If you cross the Rajasthan border and enter Punjab, within 1km one can find 15-20 fuel stations. Such is the situation at other entry points to other districts. This shows how the demand from the state is met by supply from other states. Rajasthan is losing big time,” Saharan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/state-earns-more-than-centre-on-per-litre-petrol/articleshow/87600160.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

---||Jaipur||Edu dept team to visit Finland to imbibe learning models||Jaipur: Officials and teachers of the Rajasthan education department will soon visit Finland to observe their education system and implement few of their best learning practices in Rajasthan. State government officials said that over the last decade, various varieties of schools, including Swami Vivekananda Model Schools, Mahatma Gandhi English Medium Schools, and Navodaya Government Schools were opened to reform the education system. In the next step, the government was trying to imbibe learning practices from the country with the best education system in the world. State minister of school education, Govind Singh Dotasra, said, "There is a need to improve the education system while looking at examples from the world. We have asked the officials in the education department to make a plan for the same and send it to us. Once the plan is approved, we will send some of our officials and teachers to Finland." The government school teachers have welcomed the decision and said there was a need to enhance the quality of education in the schools. A government teacher, seeking anonymity, said, "There are many state-run schools with just one teacher or dilapidated buildings. Instead of sending teachers and officials on a foreign tour, the government must focus on improving the infrastructure." Finland has no standardised testing process and students are graded individually based on a test set by teachers. They do not believe in a merit-based system and there is no list of non-performing schools or teachers. The environment of competition does not exist in Finland. Schools provide psychological counselling and individualised guidance. Finish children need to attend school compulsorily for only nine years and anything beyond that is optional for them. Experts for education in Rajasthan felt that the state needed to learn methods from Finland, but implement them as per the socio-economic condition of Rajasthan, which is opposite to Finland.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/edu-dept-team-to-visit-finland-to-imbibe-learning-models/articleshow/87594080.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai:Vigilance team of NCB records Sail statement||Mumbai: The vigilance team of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), which is probing the allegations of pay-off in the cruise liner drug bust case, on Monday recorded the statement of ‘controversial’ witness, Prabhakar Sail, for nearly six hours. NCB deputy director Gyaneshwar Singh, along with Sail, also visited the alleged meeting spots at Lower Parel and Tardeo near Indiana Hotel and tried to recreate the sequence of events. “Today we questioned Sail and took him to various places in the city in connection with the investigation. We will also record the statements of various persons connected with this case,” Singh told TOI. Sail, in his affidavit, had mentioned that Shah Rukh’s manager Pooja Dadlani, another case witness K P Gosavi and businessman Sam D’Souza had met early October 3 at Lower Parel and discussed how to save Aryan from arrest. Sail, bodyguard to Gosavi, then dropped him to his Vashi residence. Gosavi later asked Sail to pick up money from outside a hotel in Tardeo. A person arrived in a car and gave Sail two bags, which he took to D’Souza at Trident Hotel. D’Souza counted the money and said it was only Rs 38 lakh, the affidavit stated. Sail also claimed to have overheard a conversation where Gosavi and others discussed demanding Rs 25 crore, of which Rs 8 crore was to be paid to NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede. D’Souza later alleged that Dadlani had handed over Rs 50 lakh to Gosavi, but when he realised that Gosavi was a “cheat”, he asked him to return the money to her. Sources said that the NCB’s vigilance team and Mumbai Police’s special investigation team, which is also probing the extortion allegations against NCB officials in the cruise drug seizure case, are likely to approach the Pune court to seek permission to record Gosavi’s statement. Gosavi was recently arrested by the Pune police in connection with a 2018 cheating case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaivigilance-team-of-ncb-records-sail-statement/articleshow/87594101.cms||Ahmed Ali

Doctors said they would send her preserved viscera for a lab test. Laxmi, the daughter of Veerpal, a farmer, who lost three children since Thursday, had suffered a seizure moments after drinking milk. She was rushed to a doctor but died before getting any medical attention. Though she had a mild fever, her activities were normal. Chief medical officer Seema Agarwal had denied the possibility of dengue fever as no one in the family or the entire village was diagnosed with dengue. Meanwhile, panic gripped Baraatbhoj village after the children’s death. On Sunday, a team of health officials led by Dr Lokesh Gangwar visited the village and examined the family and other villagers, but no one was diagnosed with either dengue or malaria. “All three children who had died were suffering from fever. A post-mortem examination was conducted, but it couldn’t ascertain the reason for Laxmi’s death. We hope the visceral report will bring some clarity,” said Dr Gangwar. Local MLA Sanjay Gangwar, meanwhile, met the bereaved family on Sunday evening. He assured the locals that the medical team would be visiting the village regularly for the health check-up of the children to ensure such deaths don’t happen. According to an official record, nearly 151 cases of dengue and only one death have been reported from Pilibhit district so far. However, most of the private hospitals have their wards full of dengue patients and have been referring serious patients to higher medical centres in Bareilly daily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/3-kids-death-in-pilibhit-autopsy-of-one-of-them-inconclusive-viscera-preserved/articleshow/87592624.cms||---

MHT was declared a winner of the ‘Cooling in Informal Settlements’ category of the award. The model was implemented through MHT’s project involving cooling solutions implemented across at least 1,000 homes in urban slums of Ahmedabad, Surat, Bhopal, Ranchi, Jodhpur and Delhi, among others. Ashden has been supporting transformative climate solutions for more than 20 years. MHT’s project was chosen from among applications from at least 800 other organisations from across the world and the award was presented at a ceremony in Glasgow, London on November 4 – Energy Day at the COP26 event. Siraz Hirani, a senior programme management specialist at MHT attended the award ceremony. The city-based NGO is one of the 18 organisations shortlisted and one of the two Indian winners. MHT’s project is based on a study conducted globally whose key finding reveals that urban slum-dwellers are among the most adversely impacted because of climate change.  The need for cool roofing Citing a study by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), MHT spokespersons suggest that man-made climate change will lead to intense, frequent heatwaves in South Asia over the coming decades, according to their recent report. “This is bound to impact India as well and with urban slums getting more affected by impact of heat, it becomes all the more inevitable to implement cool roofing solutions,” Brahmbhatt added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/women-led-climate-resilience-model-wins-ashden-award-at-cop26/articleshow/87593417.cms||---

This is the highest in the past seven years or since 2015. According to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, the state had reported seven dengue deaths in 2015, 16 in 2016, 14 in 2017, 10 in 2018, 17 in 2019 and seven in 2020. But the disease has claimed 28 lives till November 3 this year. The state also reported 11,913 dengue cases. Out of these, 5,116 have been reported in the last 16 days (Oct 19 to Nov 3). The pace at which dengue is spreading in the state can be gauged by the fact that around 43% of the cases have been reported in 16 days this year. Doctors say that dengue is leading to more complications of multiple organs this year. Many patients getting admitted to hospitals have symptoms of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). In DHF, a patient complaints of fever with hemorrhagic tendencies, low blood platelet count and plasma leak. In DSS, a patient complaints of fever with evidence of circulatory failure characterized by rapid and weak pulse, narrow pulse pressure, cold clammy skin, restlessness and abdominal pain. “Hemorrhagic tendencies in dengue patients can be identified by positive tourniquet test, bleeding from other sites and drop in platelet count," said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College. The doctors have been asked to monitor dengue patients and identify hemorrhagic tendencies and keep observing patients for plasma leak for effective treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-reports-28-dengue-deaths-this-year-highest-since-2015/articleshow/87594104.cms||---

---||Vadodara||Wife alleges custodial torture, court summons IO||Vadodara: The chief judicial magistrate’s court on Monday summoned the investigating officer of the black dollar scam case after one of the accused’s wife made startling allegations. Shabana Bhurani, wife of Imran Bhurani, filed an application before the court on Monday for issuing a warrant to the investigating officer so that all accused be presented before the court. Shabana alleged that all accused, including her husband, were mercilessly beaten by the cops and extortion calls are being made to her and her family members by police. In her application, Shabana said that when she went to meet her husband at DCB police station at Bhadra Kacheri, she was not allowed to meet him. But when she was waiting in the office compound, she saw that Imran and other accused were not even able to stand on their feet and cops had to lift them to take them from one room to another. When she requested police to let her ask her husband about his health, they did not allow her, she stated. It has also been alleged that the investigating officer had sought their remand to take the accused to Goa and Mumbai for investigation, but they were not taken anywhere outside Vadodara city. Shabana also alleged that cops are calling her and other family members from different phone numbers asking them to pay Rs 10-15 lakh. If the money is not paid, they would ensure that all accused remain in jail for a long time, Shabana alleged further. Taking cognizance of Shabana’s application, the court issued notice to inspector V B Aal to remain present at 11.45 am on Tuesday before the court and take all accused for medical examination to SSG Hospital. The court has also asked police to present medical reports of the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/wife-alleges-custodial-torture-court-summons-io/articleshow/87593408.cms||---

However, owners are concerned over the low turnout. They are not losing hope as on Vishwakarma Day, there was a huge rush and some of the shows even went houseful. They also want the governments, both the Centre and the state, to support them and take immediate measures to give them financial support as it will take a long time for the industry to revive. Varinder Singh Chawla, owner of a multiplex near the railway station, said, “We have opened after a gap of several months and during the past four days, barring Vishwakarma Day, there has been a lukewarm response despite several new releases in Hindi, Punjabi and English. Though the situation is not so good, we are still happy as last time when we re-opened our multiplexes after lockdown, there was zero response. I think it will take a long time for the industry to get back on an even keel. It will take months for the average daily turnout to reach the 50% mark.”Chawla revealed that cinema hall and multiplex owners were under big debts due to prolonged closure of one-and-a-half year. “Even now due to the low turnout, we have to shell out money from our own pockets to keep our businesses running. It is our appeal to the state and Central governments to come to our aid and announce a relief package or else there will be permanent closures. They must compensate us for the rentals and power bills, which form a major part of our expenses,” he added.Sandeep Gandhi, owner of another multiplex, said, “Four new movie releases brought some relief. With more new releases scheduled in the coming days, we are hoping more people will turn up at cinema halls. We have passed through unprecedented times and had to bear huge losses. We paid fixed expenses from our pockets every month for more than a year without earning a penny. It is our request to the government to waive the 18% GST on sale of movie tickets for at least six months.”Manpreet Singh, general manager of a multiplex, said, “It is great to be back to work after such a huge gap, though we are not getting a large volume of business. Now when fear of coronavirus seems to be receding, we see that the majority of people have moved to OTT platforms for watching movies. However, we have not lost hope, especially after seeing a large number of people turning up on Vishwakarma Day.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/cinema-halls-start-seeing-biz-owners-seek-govt-help/articleshow/87592637.cms||Mohit Behl

Members of Goencho Ekvott, along with Velsao villagers, protested against the survey work being undertaken by a private agency and have also warned that they will come out on the streets against the work. Panch member Ashok Souza and affected owners stated that the surveyors had entered private properties to conduct the surveys without informing them or the village panchayat of Velsao-Pale-Issorcim. The residents informed the local authorities about this and condemned the state government for allowing the railway work to go on despite locals protesting against it for the past two years. Goencho Ekvott founder Orville Rodrigues said the Mormugao mamlatdar was forced to rush to the site to pacify angry villagers. He then assured them that he will convene a joint meeting with railway authorities. Goencho Ekvott joint-secretary Olencio Simoes slammed the government for supporting the illegal work on the private properties without completing the due acquisition process. Further, he accused the government of speeding up work on the three linear mega projects — Tamnar power project, Panaji-Belagavi NH expansion, and railway double tracking — by violating all the laws, only to satisfy its crony capitalist friends. Goencho Ekvott has warned the government that if such illegal and forceful development is carried out against the wishes of the people, they will be forced to come on the streets and protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/velsao-locals-allege-railway-authorities-surveyed-private-properties-without-intimating-owners/articleshow/87594130.cms||---

---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh: Dead prisoner had bullet wound, 'shot by jailor', he'd said in hospital||AGRA: A day after riots broke out in the Fatehgarh district jail, authorities confirmed on Monday that the undertrial prisoner, Shivam Thakur, 26, had died due to a “gunshot injury”. A judicial as well as a magisterial probe has been announced into the death of Thakur. This comes in addition to an investigation by a three-member "high level team" of jail officials that would go into the reason that triggered the violence that left many prisoners and 30 cops injured. DG (prisons), Anand Kumar, who visited Fatehgarh jail, told TOI that the post mortem report of Thakur had revealed that the death was caused by a “gunshot injury”. He said a special committee will also assess administrative lapses and fix responsibility. The committee will then recommend long and short term measures so that such incidents do not occur in future. “The report is to be submitted in a week and action will be taken accordingly,” he said, adding that strict action will be taken against whosoever is found guilty. Just before his death, Thakur had told media persons gathered at the hospital where he was being treated that he had a bullet wound. He claimed that he was shot by the jailor when he was closing the barrack gate during the clash. He had been in Fatehgarh jail since 2017. Official sources told TOI that the manner in which Thakur was injured -- his abdomen was completely ruptured -- it seemed that an AK-47 rifle bullet had hit him. These guns are used by police in the state. The riot in the jail was sparked off on Sunday morning after inmates learnt about the death of a convicted prisoner, Sandeep Yadav, 28, on November 6. Though the police claimed that Yadav died due to dengue, inmates blamed jail authorities for callousness as Yadav had told them he was "very unwell" on October 28. A letter purportedly written by Yadav to district magistrate Sanjay Kumar Singh mentioned that, sources said. But despite being informed about his condition, deputy jailor SK Sonkar allegedly didn’t shift him to a hospital. "I was only given some tablets, which did not give me relief," the letter states. Fellow prisoners had also requested the DM to send Yadav to hospital outside the jail as his condition was deteriorating and he was unable to eat anything. Yadav, who had been in the district jail since 2012, was sentenced to life in prison in a dowry death case. Superintendent of police Ashok Kumar Meena said "the riot took place when morning tea was being given to the jail inmates and this led to arson inside the barrack". Police claimed that prisoners had reached the jail’s terrace and pelted stones at the jail staff. Besides, some prisoners allegedly used aluminium door parts and other objects as weapons to attack the personnel, setting several plastic items on fire to prevent police from reaching them. Inmates damaged CCTV cameras, police said, adding that it took almost five hours for them to bring the situation under control. Police has registered an FIR against 28 jail inmates under 16 sections of the IPC including 307 (attempt to murder), 120 B (criminal conspiracy) along with Prevention of Damage of Public Property Act, 1884 on a complaint filed by jailor Akhilesh Kumar. Security has been beefed up in and around the jail and Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) units have been deployed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/dead-prisoner-had-bullet-wound-shot-by-jailor-hed-said-in-hosp/articleshow/87592676.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

As many as 567 hospitals in Maharashtra are under the state public health department. Tope’s comment comes in the wake of the fire that broke out in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Ahmednagar Civil Hospital on Saturday. Eleven people recovering in the ICU ward died in the fire and six patients sustained injuries. Tope said, “The collectors have now been told to sanction Rs5-7 crore through their respective district planning funds. The public works department (PWD) has been directed to clear the technical clearances for the implementation of the fire audit.” He added, “All the sanctions should be in place for all districts by the end of the month. The health department will coordinate with the PWD, finance and urban development departments to execute the fire audit reports. This is, however, a part of the short-term measures. For the long-term measures, the health department will seek the additional post of a fire safety officer for every district.” Pune collector Rajesh Deshmukh on Monday directed hospitals, for which the fire audit had been completed and funds sanctioned, to implement the recommendations. “The hospitals that are not fully compliant by November 30 will be served the final notice, after which legal action will be taken.,” he said. The fire audit of the rest of the hospitals has to be done immediately. It has been decided that the electrical load in addition to the rated capacity has to be identified within two days time, Checking of all the high electrical load equipment, such as autoclave machines, has to be completed. Besides, an official said, the 26 hospitals that had been allocated funds have to implement the fire audit recommendations by November 20. Re-audit of all government hospitals has to take place between November 20 and 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/funds-hurdle-for-implementation-of-fire-audit-views-in-525-hosps-tope/articleshow/87593418.cms||Nisha Nambiar

He said he realized this after he raped the first girl, seven years old, who he overpowered easily and no one even found out about his crime. “The accused targeted small girls as they could not resist and he felt they would also not be able to tell anyone,” an investigator said. He said that Thakor has a six-year-old daughter and his wife is seven months pregnant. For the past 15 days he could not have sex with his wife and decided to hunt for small girls. “When he raped the first girl ten days ago, she could not resist and nor did anyone find out about the incident, so he felt emboldened and decided to hunt for more,” said the cop. On Diwali day, he lured away a five-year-old girl with the promise of new clothes, raped her and dumped her. Read AlsoGandhinagar: Man arrested for raping 3 minors, killing one of victimsA depraved sex offender, who had terrorized Gandhinagar by raping three minor girls and killing one of them in the past 10 days, has finally been arrested.“He was further emboldened and thought he could keep hunting for such girls,” said a cop. The police officer said there was garba organized in a village near his on the night of New Year’s, November 6. “He saw some young girls doing garba and then went looking for his next target. He roamed about in a few villages but people were awake due to the festival. He only found a sleeping tribal family of about eight near Santej Crossroads. Thakor saw the three-year-old girl sleeping next to her five-year-old brother and picked her up,” said the police officer. He took the girl to a secluded place but as she woke up, he pressed her mouth and nose for around a minute after which she stopped moving. “The girl may have died by itself. Thakor then raped her, or more likely her body,” said a police officer. When he was caught, he told the cops that after raping the body, he duped her in the culvert where she was found on Sunday. Brothers’ similarity confused copsWhile the police zeroed in on the accused — Vijay Thakor — they were in tizzy when they saw him with his elder brother, with whom he shares a striking resemblance. Police later used their mobile phone locations to identify the real accused. When the cops were searching for the accused, they found some unclear CCTV footage in which Thakor was seen but could not be identified. Later, they got clear footage from a village panchayat CCTV camera in which his motorcycle was also identified. After this, investigators began collecting information from some villagers and they identified the perpetrator as “a Thakor living in Vansjada village. "We reached his home in Vansjada village where we were stunned to see two men who looked almost like twins. We detained both of them and then got location details from their phones, using which we zeroed in on the real accused,” said an officer of Gandhinagar police. Cops miss festivities to nab accusedOn November 4, Diwali day, Santej police registered a case for the rape of the five-year-old girl from Rancharada, after which personnel began hunting for the accused, Vijay Thakor. Another case for the three-year-old girl who went missing was filed with Gandhinagar police on November 6, which made the cops redouble efforts to nab the accused. “After the rape took place, six teams of around 100 police personnel including four police inspectors and eight police sub-inspectors set out to nab the accused who could have targeted other girls if he was not be caught,” said an officer of Gandhinagar police, adding that the cops working the case did not go home and skipped the festivities to nab the accused. “Had we not worked properly, the accused would have been roaming freely and targeted some other girls. This was an important task for us under the guidance of IGP Abhay Chudasma and Gandhinagar SP Mayur Chavda, to nab the accused,” said an officer of the Gandhinagar LCB. Seven-year-old girl an eyewitnessWhen Thakor approached the five-year-old girl from Rancharada village, her family members were picking firewood near their house. Her elder sister, 7, saw him picking her up and taking her on his motorcycle. She is the thus the first and likely only eyewitness in the case who can identify the accused. “Thakor, when he went to the five-year-old girl, told her he would buy her new clothes. The elder sister saw him talking to her and heard him promise her new clothes. She told the family about the unknown man taking away her sister. When the victim returned home, they knew she had been raped,” said a cop. The five-year-old girl was brutalized in such a way that she had to be hospitalized for around four days.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: BJP ups voter drive as ECI begins roll revision||GANDHINAGAR: As the Election Commission of India (ECI) has embarked on its electoral roll revision exercise — the last major revision before next year’s assembly election — the state unit of the BJP has intensified its drive to get new voters added to the electoral rolls and increase the chances of its candidates in the coming assembly election. All active workers of the party have been asked to get in touch with acquaintances and get as many new voters registered as possible. According to party sources, the BJP intends to increase its committed voters by 3,000 to 5,000 for every urban seat in the state, as this will be crucial where victory margins are low. Party workers have been given instructions on how to get new voters registered, how to remove names and how to make corrections to names and addresses in their respective areas. The special electoral roll revision drive will be taken up on four days of this month — November 14, 21, 27 and 28. Even as the BJP is working to a plan, the state unit of the Congress has not planned any activities around the electoral roll revision and the opposition party is viewing this as a routine administrative exercise. Sources said that while the process of electoral roll revision is an administrative exercise, political parties and other organisations also work to ensuring that the maximum number of eligible people are enrolled as voters. “As of now, the BJP seems to be doing this aggressively, while the Congress is adopting a laid-back approach,” said a political observer. Assembly elections are scheduled to be held in December next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bjp-ups-voter-drive-as-eci-begins-roll-revision/articleshow/87593434.cms||Kapil Dave

The corporation had faced difficulties in launching the land measurement drive due to stiff opposition from a group of farmers. “We could start this crucial work after meetings with the farmers who are particularly worried about the compensation. We have explained the state policy to them,” Sandeep Patil, executive engineer in-charge of land acquisition for the project, said. The land has been measured in Chimbali, Garade, Sonori, Perne, Urse, Tulapur, Lonikand, Gavadewadi and is now taking place at Khalumbre village. The MSRDC needs to acquire 859.88 hectares in 46 villages in five tehsils for the project. Patil said they are working on signing of an agreement with the farmers who have agreed to give their land. “We will have to complete the process by the year-end,” he added. The proposed 103km eastern ring road will start from Urse toll plaza at Pune-Mumbai expressway. It will pass through villages in Maval, Khed, Haveli, Daund, Purandar tehsils before merging with Mumbai-Bengaluru highway in Bhor tehsil. It will reduce traffic congestion in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporation limits. The state government has already allocated over Rs 26,000 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/measurement-of-150ha-for-eastern-ring-road-begins/articleshow/87572762.cms||Sandip Dighe

Both the urban local bodies held beach cleanliness drives on October 31 and declared the tourist destinations plastic-free zones. Officials have been deputed by the Someshwara Town Municipality and Ullal City Municipality to monitor beaches in their respective areas. Revenue officials from the urban local bodies have been visiting beaches every day to enforce the plastic ban. While Someshwara Beach is close to the Sri Somanatha Temple, the Ullal Syed Madani Darga is just 2 km from Ullal Beach. Hundreds of tourists have thronged the religious shrines and beaches after the district saw a fall in Covid-19 cases. Vani V Alva, the chief officer of the Someshwara town municipality, told TOI: “All shops in the temple town and beach premises have been warned not to use plastic. We have warned of cancellation of their trade licence if they use or sell plastic carry bags and other items. Signboards restricting tourists and devotees from carrying plastic carry bags have been put up on the temple premises and beaches. We will strictly enforce the rules to make the place free of plastic,” she said. Ullal city municipality commissioner Rayappa said that several initiatives have been launched to keep Ullal beach plastic-free. “We have suggested stalls on the beach to not use plastic cups to serve tea and coffee. Officials have been visiting regularly to enforce the plastic ban on the beach. Special emphasis is being given to keep the beach free of litter,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/someshwar-ullal-beaches-made-plastic-free-zones/articleshow/87592672.cms||---

Moreover, her latest album 'Chhath- Ek Prem Kahani', where a Muslim girl observes the fast, has become much popular among audiences. Rati, who appeared in Chhath songs and album, told TOI on call from Mumbai, "I was very much excited while appearing and acting in these songs and albums with prominent singers Rocky Raja and Ankit Mishra. It’s an unforgettable experience." “Majority of video songs or albums were shot at Virar in Mumbai and they are available on different music channels. As Chhath Puja has its significance and importance in Bhojpuri cinema and many prominent channels also broadcast Bhojpuri songs and movies, it's undoubtedly a good experience for me to work in these albums." she added. Rati was one among the 20-odd artists from Mumbai who had performed various characters in the century-old Patharchatti Ramleela in Sangam city this year. Even after moving to Mumbai to make her career in acting, she never forgot her roots and says that she wants to keep her association with the city. “When audiences, particularly people from Prayagraj and other eastern UP districts, noticed me acting in Chhath puja songs and albums, they kept on encouraging me for the act as well as the new debut in albums," she said, adding that she is also working for a Bhojpuri movie. The actress did her schooling and higher education from Sangam city. She even learnt Kathak dance form at Prayag Sangeet Samiti and still recalls her training days in Prayagraj when she did several theatre shows and plays. “The approach of Bhojpuri cinema is very wide and people recognise your work and talent. I am also trying to establish myself after doing lead roles in daily soaps, web series and Bhojpuri cinema," she said, adding that she'll be working in several different location in Gujarat from November 19 for shooting for a Bhojpuri movie.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/chhath-puja-songs-featuring-city-based-actress-become-popular-among-audience/articleshow/87593433.cms||---

The draft rules were sent to the state government in 2018, but has yet to be approved. Nearly 55% of the posts in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)’s fire department have been vacant for around three years. Sajag Nagrik Manch, a citizens’ group, has written to the government to speed up the approval process. “The jurisdiction of PMC is increasing and the fire brigade should be equipped to deal with any mishap,” said Vivek Velankar of the group. According to the civic administration’s data, the PMC fire brigade department has 910 posts. Of these, 527 posts are vacant. “The staff requirement is based on old demands. The need for manpower may go up in the days to come as 23 villages have been merged in PMC limits,” said Prashant Ranpise, head of the fire brigade. He said the department had given details of staff shortage to the civic administration, which is following up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmcs-fire-dept-operates-with-less-than-50-strength/articleshow/87593431.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

Over 21,000 students took the survey and 93 % of them stated that the exam be conducted in an online manner while the rest agreed to offline exams. The university has announced offline winter semester examinations and its departments and affiliated colleges have started offline classes since October but many students are unable to make it to colleges and university departments, and the teaching is in blended manner. SPPU is looking at ways to conduct an offline examination for the current semester. Various members of the examination reforms committee said that a definite decision can be taken only after Diwali vacations, looking at the number of Covid-19 cases as well as vaccination status of students. However, efforts are being made to at least keep some part of the three-hour examination in the offline mode. Students are of the opinion that if exams are online, the university must keep centres outside its Pune, Nashik and Ahmednagar jurisdiction too, to accommodate students who may not want to come to the college. Students also stated that online examinations must also be an alternative, as many students stay out of the state and country. Yukrand’s office-bearers have written to the SPPU as well as the ministry of higher and technical education to conduct the exams of all the universities through online as well as offline modes. Vice-president of Yukrand, Pune city unit, Kamlakar Shete, said, “ Students said that since the semester was online except for the last few days, the exam should also be conducted in the same manner.” The summer semester exam could be conducted offline, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/93-sppu-students-want-online-exams-says-study/articleshow/87572776.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Pune||Activists, students launch anti-cosmos movement||Pune: Environmentalists, representatives of educational institutions and researchers in the city have started a movement against cosmos flowering plants and started uprooting these weeds, mostly spotted along the Katraj ghat section and other parts of the city. Environmentalists said that these plants, originally from Mexico, which bloom in large numbers, directly impact the native species, grass and flowering plants as the weed competes with the local bio-chain. The foreign weed, a member of the sunflower family, is also known to be allergic to humans even though many tourists pose for photos in front of these wildly growing plants. Founder of Biospheres, Sachin Punekar, who launched the initiative called the movement against biological invasion (MABI) said, “The forest and green areas are rapidly declining due to these invasive weeds and this is having a direct impact on the ecosystem and human life. These foreign (foreign) harmful biological elements should be eradicated through public participation.” MABI is a public movement started with the objective of eradicating the Invasive Alien Species (IAS) in the country. Apart from Biospheres, other organisations participating in the campaign are Area Sabha Association of Pune, The Climate Reality Program India, Jaldevata Seva Abhiyan, ExploreIT, Shapers and Symbian’s, among others. Tree activist Sathya Natarajan, said, “Cosmos is an invasive weed that blooms in large numbers. The Cosmos plant is native to Mexico, a member of the sunflower family Asteraceae. Its beauty is a big draw. Many insect species like bees, beetles, butterflies etc collect pollens from cosmos plants in large quantities, thereby affecting the pollination of native plants. The aggressive nature of this plant endangers the environment of the country. Local food plants consumed by cattle, wild herbivores etc are declining due to the cosmos plants.” This plant bears a lot of fruit and the seed retention is very high. The seeds spread widely with the wind or other means. Malapati K Janarthanam, senior botanist and professor, Goa University, said, “Invasive plants come from elsewhere and destroy the local plants and there are many such examples of the same, apart from cosmos. The Pune group has started a movement and it should be replicated elsewhere in the country. There is no better way to destroy them other than uprooting the plants before the start of flowering.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/activists-students-launch-anti-cosmos-movement/articleshow/87593436.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Mumbai||Decision on further easing Covid curbs only next month, says Tope||Pune: State health minister Rajesh Tope on Monday said any further relaxation of existing timings or capacity for various sectors would be examined only in the first week of December. Tope said that even though daily Covid-19 infections were in the range of 800-1,000, and active cases were around 15,000 after Diwali, the state government would go slow on declaring further relaxations for any sector. “There has been a lot of crowding during the festivities. We should keep a close watch on rise in cases in any cluster, and continue to follow testing, tracking, treatment and vaccination, as has been the policy earlier,” said Tope. “We will sit with the chief minister for a review to decide on any further relaxations, provided the cases continue to go down ,” Tope told TOI. He said it was better not to make any immediate changes after the festivities though sectors such as theatres and auditoriums are demanding 100% seating capacity, and so are the locals. State surveillance expert Dr Pradip Awate said the genomic sequence carried out since May had not shown any major genetic change in the virus. “If there is no significant change in the virus, there is a little chance of a surge in cases. Having said that, the international picture presents a different frame with countries such as the UK, the US, Romania, Germany and even China seeing surge in cases,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/decision-on-further-easing-covid-curbs-only-next-month-says-tope/articleshow/87594144.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Delhi||Clutching at straws, Delhi cheers slight AQI boost||NEW DELHI: Delhi’s air quality, which remained in the “severe” category for three consecutive days, improved on Monday and touched the higher end of the “very poor” category. The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) was 390 compared with 429 on Sunday. Smog continued to appear over the city and the share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 reduced from 48 per cent on Sunday to 30 per cent on Monday. Experts said air quality touched the “very poor” category mainly due to reduction in the share of stubble burning. Gufran Beig, founder project director, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), said, “Though the fire counts increased from 4,189 on Sunday to 5,400 on Monday, the contribution of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 decreased to 30 per cent. The wind direction is favourable for transport of pollutants, but the speed of transport-level wind has reduced and smoke from stubble burning will take longer to reach Delhi. Besides, the life of pollutants released from stubble burning is just 2-3 days and can die on the way if the speed is low.” However, a weather expert said, “As the wind direction was westerly to northwesterly, the dust component increased and the farm fire portion decreased.” Though the local wind speed picked up during the day, Met officials said it was almost the same as Sunday. RK Jenamani, senior scientist at India Meteorological Department, said, “Average wind speed of 8-10 kmph was recorded between 8am and 4.30pm, which slowed down in the evening. However, there was marginal improvement in smog as visibility of 1,000-1,800 metres was recorded at Safdarjung and Palam in the morning.” The minimum temperature on Monday dropped to 13.6 degrees Celsius. Dipankar Saha, former head at CPCB’s air laboratory said, “The air quality entered from severe to very poor category due to improvement in the ventilation coefficient in the Indo-Gangetic plains. The passage through which air passes in Indo-Gangetic plains from north-northwest region to Bay of Bengal is clear as there is no depression. The sky is clear with no cloud formation and the mixing layer height is higher compared with the past few days.” The air quality is likely to remain in the “very poor” category. SAFAR said, “Winds coming from the northwest direction at 925mb are favourable for transport of stubble related pollutants to Delhi. However, its impact on PM2.5 has reduced along with the wind speed. AQI is likely to improve, but remain in the very poor category.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/clutching-at-straws-city-cheers-slight-aqi-boost/articleshow/87593442.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Agra||Govt hospitals in Agra lack proper fire safety infrastructure||AGRA: The blaze that claimed the lives of 11 patients in the ICU ward of the district civil hospital in Maharashtra's Ahmednagar on Saturday, has again brought to the forefront the need for fire safety measures in medical facilities. In Agra region, government hospitals are at a risk as they are not equipped to deal with a fire. A case in point is the SN Medical College, the largest government medical facility in the region. As per the official estimate, more than 2,000 patients and 3,000 caretakers are present in the hospital every day. A quick check revealed that several wards had no arrangements to extinguish a fire. Expired fire extinguishers were found hanging on the walls. An enquiry revealed that the emergency water supply unit was not functional and that too, for the past four years. The hospital did not even have a functional emergency alarm system as a warning to evacuate in case a fire breaks out. The fire signages were missing. The situation at the district hospitals across the region was no better. Health department officials claimed that private companies had been tasked to make arrangements for fire safety. “The work is in progress,” said an official. AK Singh, additional director of the health department, said, “Fires can be devastating, especially in a hospital where a large number of people who need to be evacuated may be vulnerable such as those who are immunocompromised, on life support or are incapable of moving on their own. We will check and ensure that the government centres fulfill all the standard fire safety protocols.” At SNMC’s surgical block, two fire incidents have occurred over the last four years. In 2018, a fire broke out in the nurse staff room and the furniture was gutted. In 2019, a fire broke out in the store room. In both cases, hospital staff and police had a tough time in shifting patients out of the eight-storeyed building. In 2016-17, the state government had approved a budget of Rs 4.90 crore to install a fire safety system at the SNMC. Under the project, a central water supply pipeline was proposed to be laid in all wards. The work was to be completed in one year. However, the fire safety system in the hospital remains non-functional. According to the fire safety guidelines of the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers (NABH), a hospital must have a multi-disciplinary safety committee with a senior person as chairman of the safety committee that should meet at least once in three months. The organization must appoint A fire safety officer, who is in charge of fire prevention and safety, must be appointed. The organization should have an emergency command centre that becomes functional as soon as a fire breaks out. However, none of these guidelines are being implemented at the government hospitals, TOI learnt. Dr Prashant Gupta, SNMC principal, said, “The firefighting infrastructure is being developed at the hospital. A private company is working on it. The central fire fighting system will be functional in the next one month. For now, testing work is taking place. We will check and ensure that the fire extinguishers are in working condition and placed at appropriate spots.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/govt-hospitals-in-agra-lack-proper-fire-safety-infrastructure/articleshow/87592687.cms||Deepak Lavania

The barn owl was found injured in the Gotri area on November 4 by the volunteers who took it for medical treatment. According to the GSPCA, one of the owl’s wings was clipped by some unidentified person. “It may be the handiwork of some people who believe in tantrik rituals performed on Kali Chaudas – a day before Diwali. We have given it medical treatment and kept the owl under observation. Once it recovers, it will be released in its natural habitat,” said Raj Bhavsar, secretary, GSPCA. “In India, owls are considered to be the ‘vahana’ or mount of Lakshmi — the goddess of wealth and prosperity— worshipped during Diwali. Many people believe that sacrificing owls in black magic rituals will provide them with favours from the goddess. So many wildlife traffickers trade live owls and owl body parts such as talons, skulls, bones, feathers, meat and blood, which are then used in talismans, black magic and traditional medicines,” said GSPCA volunteers. On the night of November 3, nearly a dozen persons were also booked for sacrificing two goats behind Khaswadi crematorium in Karelibaug. The GSPCA volunteers and forest officials raided the spot after they received a tip-off about the animal sacrifice. They found two dead goats that were buried after performing rituals at the spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/injured-barn-owl-used-for-tantrik-rituals-rescued/articleshow/87593469.cms||---

All 13 MSRTC depots across Pune and other districts were hit. Pune MSRTC’s traffic manager Dyaneshwar Ranaware told TOI that until 5pm, more than 1,600 trips from Pune got cancelled. Around 95 per cent of some 850 buses from Pune remained off the road. The most affected were people going back from home after Diwali and also daily officegoers. Officials said estimated losses in Pune were over Rs 70 lakh and more than 1.20 lakh commuters were affected. Mahesh Dixit, who came home to Pune for Diwali, shared, “I had booked a ticket online to Kolhapur to rejoin work on Tuesday. At Swargate depot, there were no buses and no help. I took a private bus that cost me almost double.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/commuters-post-diwali-plans-affected-by-absence-of-buses/articleshow/87593450.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Ahmedabad||‘Set up exclusive special courts to hear atrocity cases’||Ahmedabad: A Dalit rights activist has requested the chief justice of Gujarat high court to establish exclusive special courts to expeditiously conduct caste atrocity cases which are pending in special courts and moving at a sluggish pace. In his representation, activist Valjibhai Patel drew the chief justice’s attention to 3,668 pending cases related to the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 2016 and submitted that there are no exclusive courts to conduct these cases in Gujarat, though special courts have been established in 16 districts. These courts do not hear atrocity cases exclusively. Since, other IPC cases are also heard by these courts resulting in delay in trials in atrocity-related cases, he stated. Patel also pointed out that the state government and the Centre have to fund these exclusively special courts, but the courts in Gujarat have been established from funds drawn from the budget for community development. He urged the CJ to take suo motu cognizance of the issue on the ground that the constitutional rights of the members of SC/ST communities have been violated. He has urged the chief justice to direct the state government to fund these courts from the budget allocated to the social justice department and not from the budget meant for development of SC/ST communities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/set-up-exclusive-special-courts-to-hear-atrocity-cases/articleshow/87593455.cms||---
---||Delhi||‘Severe’ measures under GRAP come into force in Delhi-NCR||NEW DELHI: With the air quality likely to fluctuate between “severe” and the higher-end of “very poor” category in the coming days due to unfavourable weather conditions and high contribution of stubble burning, the sub-committee constituted for operational of Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) on Monday enforced “severe” measures with immediate effect in Delhi-NCR. All hot-mix plants and stone-crushers have been ordered to be closed and the agencies in Delhi-NCR directed to intensify public transport services by introducing differential rates to encourage off-peak travel. Prashant Gargava, member secretary of CPCB and chairperson of the sub-committee, said, “After considering the meteorological conditions of one week, we have asked the NCR states to implement the severe category measures of GRAP. Citizens should also take steps to check air polluting activities.” The sub-committee has ordered for maximising power generation from gas-based plants to reduce operation of coal-based ones in the NCR. The Badarpur power plant has already been shut down. Agencies have been asked to increase the frequency of mechanised cleaning of roads, sprinkling of water and identification of stretches with higher dust generation. Brick kilns would remain closed in Delhi-NCR. The measures under the “moderate”, “poor” and “very poor” categories would continue to be implemented. VK Soni from IMD said winds were expected to be northwesterly for the next five days with a speed of 6-10 kmph. This might result in improvement of air quality. However, calm winds at night would cause air quality to deteriorate. RWAs and individual house owners had been asked to provide electric heaters during winter to security staff to avoid open burning by them. The sub-committee had asked citizens to check air polluting activities, including keeping engines of vehicles properly tuned, not dispose of waste in the open and report air pollution activities through SAMEER app, social media platforms and other public grievance portals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/severe-measures-under-grap-come-into-force/articleshow/87593464.cms||---

Sawant, who had earlier dismissed issues of rising crime against women, indirectly admitted the state needs to do more. “We will take more steps towards the safety and security of women in the coming days,” he said at the inaugural function of the National Women’s Parliament, organised by the legislature secretariat and the state government. While he said he feels upset when crimes are committed against women in the state, the chief minister maintained that Goa leads all other states where crime detection is concerned. “Goa has a crime detection rate of 93%. One can’t compare this with other states,” he said. A few months ago, Sawant had told the state assembly after the gangrape of minors that teens, particularly minors, should not be “spending the nights on beaches”. “When 14 year olds stay on the beach the whole night, the parents need to introspect. Just because children don’t listen, we cannot put the responsibility on the government and police,” he had tried to justify. Sawant said resolutions passed at the National Women’s Parliament would be sent to the Goa assembly and to Parliament, too. Highlighting Goa’s achievements, Sawant said the state has accorded 33% reservation for women at the panchayat and zilla panchayat levels, enabling many to become public representatives. He also said Goa is steadily becoming self-reliant, a goal that will be achieved in this, the 60th year of its Liberation. The National Women’s Parliament, he said, has been organised to encourage women in the avenues of business, career, employment, and leadership. He also said that people from all sectors should visit the venue and participate in debates and discussions involving central and state government schemes, and problems faced by women, among other topics. Lauding women for working in all sectors, Union minister for state Shripad Naik exhorted them to come out in large numbers and take the country forward. Benaulim NCP MLA Churchill Alemao, who was also present at the event, urged the chief minister to protect the communal harmony of the state. The National Women’s Parliament comprises participants from Arunachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Jammu and Kashmir, Delhi, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. The first day saw sessions on socio-political challenges in women empowerment, women’s status and decision-making power, and women in corporate life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-soon-more-steps-to-fight-rising-crime-against-women/articleshow/87594148.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Commuters face 3+ hr traffic snarls near Panaji, Zuari||PANAJI: Thousands of commuters were stuck in mega-traffic jams on Monday evening as all three Mandovi bridges including Atal Setu, the Panaji-Merces, Panaji-Miramar, and Agasaim-Verna stretches saw snarls that lasted over three hours. Several occurrences that all happened together led to this unfortunate situation. While the Merces to KTC bus stand stretch is being concretised, the Ribandar causeway has been closed for repairs. Add to this, increased tourist traffic movement and a national event at Taleigao, for which nearly 300 buses ferried visitors, and regular commuters were resigned to their fate, stuck on the road till the late hours. It was complete chaos at the Merces circle, as traffic coming in from Atal Setu, Bambolim and Ponda all jostled for space. Every junction linking Panaji, Porvorim and Merces saw bottlenecks. Even as traffic police tried their best to control the situation, the load was too much. Meanwhile, people took to social media to vent their frustration, and made desperate appeals to the chief minister. Netizens slammed the government for the lack of planning and lack of coordination between government departments and agencies. Regular commuters said that the traffic jams have been happening over the last couple of days, and that it was expected that the government would take necessary steps to ease traffic, instead, it went out of control. Haphazard road work is considered a major cause of the traffic snarls. “State of affairs in #Goa: Everyday massive #traffic #chaos over the #atalsetu. Today, the whole bridge heading from Porvorim to Panjim is #blocked #JAMMED #mismanagement by #PWD & #GoaTrafficPolice #disgusting #useless,” a citizen tweeted on Monday evening. He appealed to the Goa chief minister to “stop the entry of private vehicles from other states into #Goa during the tourist period of November and December”. Dy SP (Traffic), North Goa, Salim Shaikh, told TOI, “After the Ribandar causeway road caved in, we had to urgently block the road for all types of traffic, else it would pose danger for motorists. The PWD started work on the road soon after, while the traffic has been diverted via the Merces-Kadamba road. The road, therefore, has double the volume of traffic”. In addition to this, the ongoing concretisation of the Kadamba bus stand stretch has slowed down traffic on the road. Some lanes were closed for this work. “There are only three lanes available — Atal Setu in two lanes and the normal traffic moving from the Kadamba bus stand towards the Merces circle — for the traffic coming from five lanes,” he said. “We have contacted the PWD and authorities concerned to get the work done on a war footing. Once the road is back in its normal condition, only then will traffic be normalised. It may take two to three days for this, by which time the national conference will also come to an end,” Shaikh said. Around the Zuari bridge, Dilip Buildcon, who are constructing the new Zuari bridge, closed the Agasaim highway for vehicles moving from Bambolim to the Zuari bridge on the high-volume Diwali weekend, when scores of tourists descended into the state, and diverted them along the old narrow road. The vehicles were stuck in traffic from Siridao to Zuari bridge. “@goa why are all your roads clogged with traffic?! Where is the mgmt? Basic infra is missing”, Swapnil tweeted.  Another motorist, Anish, said, “Year-end and traffic jams look like Goa is back in business!”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/commuters-face-3-hr-traffic-snarls-near-panaji-zuari/articleshow/87594160.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Constable held for taking bribe 3 years ago in Rajasthan's Baran||KOTA: Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) special unit, Kota on Monday arrested a Rajasthan police constable for allegedly taking a bribe of Rs 5,000 three years ago when he was posted at Mangrole police station of Baran district. The accused constable was later in the day produced before the ACB court in the city, that ordered to send him to jail under judicial custody. In-charge, ACB, special unit, Kota, DSP Dharamveer Singh said that a 60-year-old man from Mau village under Mangrole police station of Baran district on April 30, 2018, lodged a complaint against constable Rameshwar Prasad, then posted at Mangrole police station, and stated his son was lodged in Mangrole police station in a case under section 354 of IPC against him. He further alleged the constable had demanded Rs 10,000 for not remanding and thrashing his son in the police station, he added. The ACB carried out the verification of the complaint on the same day when the accused accepted Rs 5,000 and asked for the remaining amount of Rs 2,000 the next day, he said. The trap was conducted the next day, on May 1, 2018 but the accused, sensing the presence of ACB personnel around, refused to accept the remaining bribe amount of Rs 2,000. However, the ACB lodged a case under sections 7, 13 (1) (D), 13 (2) PC Act 1988 against Rameshwar Prasad and initiated investigation, he further said. The allegation against the constable was confirmed in the investigation following which the ACB sent the case for approval for prosecution against the constable. Following approval for prosecution against the accused constable, ACB special unit, Kota on Monday arrested the accused constable and produced him before the ACB court later, that ordered to send him to jail under judicial custody till November 22, the DSP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/constable-held-for-taking-bribe-3-yrs-ago-in-baran/articleshow/87594161.cms||---

But creating doubts regarding this claim are several cases of persons getting certificates for the second dose even when they have not got it. Covid-19 vaccination in the city had been a largely smooth affair after the hiccups when the vaccination of all adults had started. Incidents, when vaccination was low as doses were not available, have also gone down. But now, a new row has cropped up over certificates of second vaccination being issued without the dose being given. Ravi Barot, a resident of Gorwa, got the message and the certificate regarding the second dose last month. “I was busy with work regarding property tax on the day I was shown to have taken the second dose. The certificate was complete with the name of the vaccine, date and the name of the vaccinator,” he said. Barot is not an exception. Such cases are being reported from across the city. Nilesh Mohite, who was part of a team that organised a vaccination camp said that many who were vaccinated on the camp held on July 11 got messages. “A few persons told me about this initially. Then I happened to meet a functionary from Sanstha Vasahat where the camp was held. He told me that many people were approaching him with similar issues,” said Mohite. Congress worker from Tandalja, Wasim Sheikh, too said that there were many such cases in Tandalja. “I have gathered details of such persons who met me too,” he said. The second dose messages and certificates are believed to be snags much like the initial phase of the drive when persons who did not take vaccines got messages. At that time even those who had died were shown as vaccinated. Vadodara Municipal Corporation’s medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel said that the exact reason was not known, but certificates were being generated on their own in some cases. “We ensure that in such cases, the person takes the dose. If there is any reluctance on part of such persons, our officials sensitize them too,” said Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/technical-snag-administers-2nd-dose-to-many-on-paper/articleshow/87593480.cms||Sachin Sharma

At that time, capital was scarce too, and he did not have it to lure buyers, who mostly preferred big volume players. Baid had just moved to Jodhpur from Vizag a couple of years after losing his father. Before shifting to his native state, he dabbled as a small vendor to the Naval ships but that did not fetch him the rewards he expected. His father and uncles had a small tea and oil business. Because it was a joint family affair, he could not bargain for a share for his new venture. Like any upstart, the odds were heavily stacked against him in Jodhpur too. “I could not attract buyers because I did not have enough volume. They would go to big players who were already entrenched in the market,” said Baid. After wondering a few months over what he could do to divert some of the buyers, Baid tried to make the elephants, watches, and peacocks functional, not just showpieces to be tossed into a corner after the initial fancy. “The pieces got noticed when I added boxes, hooks, and other utilities to them. It clicked and buyers slowly started showing up,” said Baid. But his worries did not end there. In the absence of capital, he worked as a deemed (indirect) exporter to MMTC for shipping his handicrafts even though it meant sharing his margins. The revenue was not enough to invest in growth. His search for capital continued as he did not have anything to offer as collateral. “One day, my search for capital brought me to a Canara Bank branch in Jaipur. It turned out to be a new beginning. I did not look back after that,” said Baid. With a south-Indian upbringing, Baid found a soft corner in the Kannadiga branch manager who offered him loans against his export invoices. He also started saving 10% of his export receipts in the bank which would work as security for his future loans. Baid bought his first factory in Jodhpur in 1992 and another in 1996 in Jaipur. By 2005, he had five units, but not a house for himself. “I took out money only for household expenses and the rest was ploughed back into the business even though it meant I lived in a rented house,” said Baid. The struggles early on had shaped his business acumen. In handicraft, craftsmanship thrives when you have a design that sells. “That’s a secret I learnt during my visits to clients in Europe. The idea of hiring a foreign designer grew big on me. But the fees they charged was more than 50% of my revenues then. I took the gamble and hired one,” recalled Baid. In the end, it paid him dividends. “Indian craftsmanship has to marry international trends if you want to succeed as an exporter,” said Baid, adding, “Today, my budget for the designing team (about 60) exceeds more than the revenue of many exporters.” Along the journey, he started experimenting with materials; from wood works, he forayed into ceramics, glass, metal and paper machetes. “In fact,” Baid said, “There are not many manufacturers who use multiple materials in any particular piece of handicraft. It is difficult but we have innovated the techniques.” Handicrafts is an unorganized industry. At one time, Baid used to supply raw materials and designs to artisan families in Aligarh and Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh to make products for him. In India, the manufacturers make products but branding is done by big buying houses abroad. It is still an area where the manufacturers have failed to create new opportunities. “We create the products, but big buyers in Europe and the US make brands out of them which fetch hefty returns. I wanted to change that by creating my own brands but the rigors of the business did not spare me time,” said Baid. But recently that changed. During his studies in University College London, Baid’s son Ayush needed a subject for his dissertation. He was in Jaipur on holidays and used to spend time in his father’s factory. “One day, he asked me why we don’t have a brand even though we make so many quality products that sell well in the western markets. That’s how Ellementary was born when he came back to India after studies,” said Baid. Today, Dileep industries are at an inflection point, with branding sitting at the centre of the new push. The company is investing Rs 100 crore in a greenfield project to manufacture and create a brand for knobs and handles made of metal, ceramic, horns, bones, etc. “There is no big Indian brand in the hardware segment and we are giving it a shot. Very soon, we will be launching it,” added Baid. Dileep Industries has an annual revenues of around Rs 175 crore. With new product pipeline, it wants to reach Rs 1,000 crore in the next five years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/a-rosewood-elephant-was-just-an-elephant-we-added-utility-to-it-ushered-in-a-new-trend/articleshow/87594162.cms||Srikanta Tripathy
---||Goa||Govt gave yachting assn undue benefit, Goa lost Rs 4 crore: CAG||PANAJI: The river navigation department’s (RND) failure to act against the “illegal” use of 251 sqm of land at Dona Paula has given the Goa Yachting Association (GYA) “undue benefit” while the government incurred a loss of Rs 4 crore since 2011-12, found an internal audit. Authorities have assessed the rental value of the 251sqm of land and have concluded that the RND has done little to stem the loss to the state exchequer either through a rental agreement or eviction. “The government may initiate recovery of rent as well as execution of the rent agreement or evacuation process,” an official said. On October 22, TOI reported that the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India has opened an inquiry to estimate the quantum of revenue loss to the government exchequer due to the “illegal occupation” by the GYA of the RND property at Dona Paula. The principal accountant general in an audit inquiry opened on September 30 said that the GYA is taking undue benefit of the property of the RND without paying rent. “The PWD estimated that the rental value as of 2012 as Rs 1.77 lakh per month hence the rental value of Rs 3.94 crore was calculated with a penal value of Rs 15 lakh added at 5% interest,” an official privy to the case said. From the disputed property, the GYA is running a restaurant and bar, along with a Goan boutique and its main office. GYA president Siddharth Satardekar has repeatedly said that the GYA owns the land and has helped train and prepare sailors, particularly Dayne and Katya Coelho who represented India at the Asian Games 2018 at Jakarta. Pearl Colvalcar, another trainee with the GYA won the silver medal in the Laser Radial Class at the Senior National Sailing Championship and the GYA is now trying to prepare sailors for the Asian Games 2022 and Paris Olympics 2024. On June 24, deputy collector Gurudas Desai had rejected the GYA claim on the land but immediately after that on August 25, revenue minister Jennifer Monserrate stayed Desai’s order. “The government may initiate recovery of rent as well as execution of the rent agreement or evacuation process,” the CAG said in its recommendation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-gave-yachting-assn-undue-benefit-state-lost-rs-4-crore-cag/articleshow/87594164.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Jodhpur||7 more Demoiselle cranes die near Jodhpur, toll touches 82||JODHPUR: Deaths of 82 Demoiselle cranes, locally known as ‘kurjan’, have been reported in the past three days in Kaparda village near Jodhpur. Preliminary investigation and examination by veterinarians has suspected these casualties to be caused by the dreaded Ranikhet disease, also known in the west as Newcastle disease, which is a contagious, viral and highly fatal avian ailment. Veterinarian Shrawan Singh Rathore said 7 more casualties were reported on Monday, taking the toll to 82. “Besides, 16 birds are under treatment at the rescue centre and are gradually recovering,” said Rathore. He said the viscera samples of the dead ones have been sent to the laboratory in Bhopal for detailed report and keeping in view the disease, vaccines were being administered. As a precaution, forest department and vets are not letting new flocks of migratory birds land, considering the threat to their lives as well. “This was the time for their influx in Marwar. But we have not been letting either the new flocks of birds or the birds from other locations land at this pond in Kaparda, considering the potential threat of the disease,” he said. According to him, about 300 birds had been staying at this site, of which some have flown away. “In such a situation, we have also been trying to keep the current birds from flying away as a precaution. Considering the disease, if these birds fly to some other site and come into contact with the birds there, the disease could spread to those birds as well. So we are trying our best to keep the remaining birds from flying from here,” Rathore said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/7-more-demoiselle-cranes-die-near-jodhpur-toll-touches-82/articleshow/87594165.cms||---

In order to avoid a situation where the farmers are deprived of personal insurance cover for loans, the bank is said to be mulling to amending the rules. Personal life insurance cover is given to farmers who take loan up to Rs 10 lakh from co-operative banks. In case of natural death of the loanee, the amount is paid by the insurance company. Officials in the Apex cooperative bank said companies were not agreeing to the provision of security deposit as performance guarantee. Similarly they are not in agreement with the bank’s demand for sharing of unclaimed premium on a 50:50 ratio. For instance if the insurance company had collected Rs 1,000 as premium and paid only Rs 700 towards insurance claim, according to the bank demand, the remaining Rs 300 had to be shared in a 50% ratio between the company and the bank. This provision did not find favour by the insurance companies. Another point of contention is an arbitration clause in case of disputes which the insurance companies are not agreeing to.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/not-many-takers-for-apex-bank-crop-insurance-cover/articleshow/87594163.cms||---

The nearly 50-page report had outlined 15 recommendations, which were supposed to be implemented by the state government. The fire had broken out inside the special neonatal care unit of the hospital on January 9. As many as 10 newborn babies admitted in the faclity died in the blaze, while seven newborns were rescued. Warick said, “The recommendations are in the process of implementation. Once the approval comes, the funds will be provided by the state government.” Among the submitted recommendations readied by P S Rahangdale, the former director of the Maharashtra Fire Service and now holding the same post for disaster management in the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai in Mumbai, has sought for training of health staffers, empowerment of the district-level authorities to improve accountability, improvement of CCTV network, SOPs for planning and construction of any new hospital, fire volunteer programmes and strengthening of the fire service manpower and fire academy. Warick said, “While the government had appointed nodal officers for all types of audits, including that of fire, electric, structural and oxygen supply, in hospitals, guidelines needed to be issued for effective implementation of the observations during these audits.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/suggestions-after-bhandara-blaze-in-process-of-execution/articleshow/87593482.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Pune||PCMC set to revive its pay-and-park policy||Pimpri Chinchwad: The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation is planning to revive its failed pay-and-park policy, by providing five towing vans to the Pimpri Chinchwad police department. PCMC’s executive engineer, Shrikant Sawane, said that the unavailability of towing vans and lack of manpower had resulted in a poor response to the policy after its implementation back in July this year. Sawane told TOI, “We have floated a tender for towing van operations via a private firm. In our earlier tendering process, we did not receive any response, resulting in an extension till November 1. We are hoping to get a response this time round from the towing firms, so that we will be able to restart the pay-and-park policy once again.” According to Sawane, the manpower available depleted over time after the last time this initiative was mooted, which affected the response. He added, “This time, we are making sure that the police department gets the towing facility, so that they can start taking action against vehicles in no-parking zones.” Pimpri Chinchwad commissioner of police Krishna Prakash affirmed that they have demanded towing vehicles and jammers to initiate action against parking violations. Interestingly, when the policy was introduced on July 1 this year, opposition parties had strongly opposed the civic body’s move. The policy was introduced across 20-plus locations in the twin towns, but it never received the desired response from citizens. The per-hour parking charges were fixed at Rs 5 for two and three-wheelers, Rs 10 for cars, Rs 15 for tempos, Rs 25 for minibuses, and Rs 100 for private buses and heavy vehicles like trucks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-set-to-revive-its-pay-and-park-policy/articleshow/87572816.cms||---

Over the past 10 years the exports in this sector have grown at a CAGR of 8%, from Rs 12,975 crore in 2010-11 to Rs 25,679 crore in 2020-21. In the decade through 2020-21, the number of exporters registered with the Exports Promotion Council for Handicraft has shot up from 6,000 to 10,000. But we have a long way to go. India’s share in the global handicrafts trade is just 1%. It’s a labour intensive industry that engages over 7 million people directly and many more indirectly by way of designing, packaging, logistics and others. We need to create more jobs and the sector can be the easy answer. India has certain unique advantages. The handicrafts we make in the country are handcrafted and handmade with Indian designs, patterns, motifs which are ethnic, yet modern. We have abundant availability of unique local raw materials like natural fibres, bamboo, cane, horn, jute, leather, etc. The production cost is also low with high value addition. The potential for growth is immense but there are headwinds we have to sail across. The sector is still unorganised and highly fragmented, characterised by traditional production technology resulting in lower output. Design and new product development is one aspect which needs greater focus. Designs and patterns, motifs, and colours have to be more functional and blended into international trends. Marketing is largely traditional which needs to be recalibrated to leverage the power of digitalisation. The business ecosystem in the clusters has to improve with better infrastructure like testing labs, trade facilitation centres and common facility centres for technology up-gradation at the local level. High logistics cost is another area that hurts the competitiveness of the sector. More importantly, we are lagging in creating global brands despite having enough talent in the country. Our entrepreneurs are capable of making products with global quality and designs while retaining the inherent Indian strength. But somehow, we have not been able to crack the branding puzzle. In order to create a brand, the entrepreneurs need investments in multi-format marketing communications utilizing both online and offline marketing tools.

The current stock of blood can meet the requirements in the civic limits for around five days. The decline in Covid-19 cases and increase in planned surgeries are leading to more requirement of blood. On an average, around 800 bags of blood are needed per day in the civic limits. “Around 4,500 to 5,000 bags are available at present. This stock can last for only around five days,” a source said. Many blood donors are currently unable to donate blood as precautionary measures post-vaccination. Authorities have been appealing to residents to come forward and donate blood to tide over the shortage. According to donors, the blood donation camps were not being conducted regularly, which was adding to the problem. The pandemic had an adverse impact on the camps. “The social as well as religious organizations should come forward to conduct blood donation camps,” said Ram Bangad of Raktache Nate organization, which promotes blood donation. According to the camp organizers, many who have taken the jabs do not have the exact information about the eligibility to donate blood. This was creating more problems in meeting the demand, the camp organisers said. “Even though blood donation camps are not being conducted in large numbers, the situation is better now compared to the core pandemic situation. But, there is still scope to increase the camps,” said Hitenn Munoat of Sahayata Shubh-Hith foundation, which organises the camp. Planned surgeries were stopped due to the pandemic and even treatments such as blood transfusion were reduced. Now as things are returning to normalcy, the requirement has gone up. At times, the demand goes up to 1,000 to 1,200 bags per day, a district official said. “We are appealing to people to donate blood. But, bulk generation is not taking place. It has brought down the overall stock,” said a senior district official. “Companies and colleges organize camps on a large scale. Most of them are not functioning at full strength. It is affecting the collection,” he added. Mayor Murlidhar Mohol, too, appealed to citizens to come forward and donate blood.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/high-demand-short-supply-lead-to-shortage-of-blood/articleshow/87593492.cms||---

The proposal has been tabled before the standing committee of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). Earlier, the same committee had given nod of nearly Rs58 crore in funds for this project, which was first initiated by the Pune Smart City Development Corporation Limited (PSCDCL). At the time, opposition parties had objected to this financial assistance, saying that it was wastage of public funds. The proposal was on the agenda on last Tuesday but could not be approved. Standing committee chairman Hemant Rasane said, “We have decided to postpone a decision on the proposal. More discussions will be carried out.”  Aba Bagul, leader of Congress in PMC, said, “Funding for the project is not necessary as the initiative has not proved effective. There is hardly any chance that it will be useful for better management of traffic.” The project report stated that as many as 261 traffic lights will be installed across PMC areas. The project will involve installing adaptive traffic controls, lights and sensors, variable message sign boards and a command control centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/funds-for-adaptive-traffic-mgmt-system-face-review/articleshow/87572821.cms||---

The health staffers started visiting every household to find the immunization status of each citizen and counsel the unvaccinated or those due for the second dose to get the shot. “The objective, initially, is to conduct doorstep counselling of every citizen to take the shot by reaching out to the near-home vaccination centre,” state immunization officer Sachin Desai. Lakhs of people across the state have delayed or skipped the second shot despite being eligible due to festivities in the last few days and because the second wave appears to be abating. The state government has revealed that over 70 lakh people are estimated to be overdue for the second shot. “Our staffers will talk to them, convince them about the importance of taking the second shot for long-term immunity, and address their hesitancy and wrong notions, if any,” Desai said. The central government on Wednesday launched its “Har Ghar Dastak” Covid-19 inoculation campaign to increase the vaccination coverage, paving the way for door-to-door inoculation. Maharashtra has been administering the highest doses among all the states in the country. Over the last few days, the daily vaccination number has gone down because of festivities and growing inclination in believing that the pandemic is over. There is a minuscule number of unvaccinated citizens who have still not got a single dose, “The health staffers will gather information about unvaccinated, partly and fully vaccinated details of the households during the initiative,” Desai said. A list of beneficiaries has been prepared in districts where the second dose coverage is low, and many are overdue. “It is likely that 5-10% of the population continue to be hesitant. The doorstep counselling initiative is aimed at winning them over to take the shot,” Desai said. Of the state's targeted eligible population of 9.15 crore, as many as 6,78,52,061 have got the first shot and among them, 3,17,29,030 have received the second shot till November 8. “People are more focused on reclaiming income sources to compensate the losses during the lockdown. They also need to be provided doorstep vaccination,” said health activist Sanjay Dabhade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/door-to-door-counselling-starts-to-achieve-100-vaccine-coverage/articleshow/87593497.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Apart from this, central government recently increased the BSF jurisdiction up to 50 kms after which to strengthen the security of the international border, two-tier security system has been implemented. For this local police’s help is also being taken, he said. The DG said the enemy country is using drones as a new weapon to smuggle drugs and weapons. Anti-drone system is of two types — one is to hit the drone and the other is to take control of the drone’s software.

---||Ahmedabad||Higher seroprevalence led to fewer cases in second wave: Study||AHMEDABAD: While the vaccination for Covid-19 began in January this year, the case positivity rate after the first time was relatively lower along with lower rate of vaccination. The factors resulted in relatively lower seropositivity, which was not enough to thwart the second wave that recorded massive spike in daily cases, claimed a recently published study. On the other hand, more seroprevalence resulted in relatively lower infections in second wave, claimed the study ‘COVID-19 Infection in 8 Big Cities of India: The Dynamics of the Spread and Seropositivity’ published in the European Journal of Medical and Health Sciences. The authors included experts from India, Japan, the UK and the US. The study took the data of seroprevalence from a private pathology lab for eight cities – Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Coimbatore, Jaipur, Nagpur, Pune, Surat and Vishakhapatnam – and extrapolated it with the data of daily Covid-19 cases for the same cities during the second wave to see the impact of the seropositivity on the amount of cases. ‘In July 2020, 683 new cases per million were recorded… The peak was reported at 8,431 cases per million. In June 2021, the lowest monthly cases at 284 per million were registered. The seroprevalence in 48.4% residents was not enough to stop the second wave of the pandemic as a large number of cases were registered in March and continued till May 2021,’ mentioned the paper. About Surat, the study mentions that the city recorded relatively lower cases at 6,647 per million in April 2021. In June, it went down to 306 per million. The seroprevalence was higher (32%) in July compared to other cities, it adds. A state Covid task force member, while assessing the figures, said that the findings come with a caveat. “The methodology mentions that it was not a random sampling – the patients who came specifically for Covid or other disease related tests were assessed. It may not give the true picture of the given population,” mentioned the member. “Nonetheless, it should be taken as an indicator for the need to achieve higher vaccination to reduce new cases.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/higher-seroprevalence-led-to-fewer-cases-in-second-wave-study/articleshow/87594191.cms||---

A housing society having a minimum of 25 residents — either unvaccinated or due for the second dose — can now avail of the benefit of free vaccination on its premises. “We have brought down the required number of participants from 50 to 25 for every society now because the vaccination coverage for the first dose has almost reached 94% across the district,” said the Pune Municipal Corporation’s chief immunization officer, Suryakant Devkar. Office-bearer of such a housing society just needs to submit an application to the ward medical officer concerned of PMC to vaccinate the residents. S/he can either mail the application or physically submit it to the ward office. “Ward offices’ email addresses and phone numbers are given on the PMC’s website,” Devkar said. A lot of floating population and migrant workers are there in PMC limits. “We want to ensure that everyone residing in the jurisdiction of PMC is immunized,” Devkar said. Health activist Sanjay Dabhade said, “Housing societies’ office-bearers need to act proactively and should ensure that all the residents on their premises are vaccinated.” A total of 34,635 residents took the Covid-19 vaccine shot in the Pune district on Monday. With this, the total number of doses administered in the district went up to 1.22 crore. Among them, 78,67,893 have received the first dose and 43,32,695 have got both the doses so far. The district’s total population is 1.17 crore. Of this, a total of 83.42 lakh residents are above 18 years and eligible to get the Covid vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-increases-scope-of-drive-in-housing-societies/articleshow/87593503.cms||Umesh Isalkar

However, he was acquitted of all charges by the high court in 2014. The man had filed a writ petition before the HC Madurai bench in 2021, seeking to redact his name from the judgement copy.Dismissing his plea, the single bench had observed that the court honestly feels that the criminal justice system is yet to reach such standards where courts can venture to pass orders for redaction of name of an accused person on certain objective criteria prescribed by rules or regulations.The single bench had further observed that in the absence of any statutory backing the court cannot undertake the exercise of issuing directions when no judicially manageable standards exist in the first place. There must be a proper policy formulated in this regard by means of specific rules. In other words, some basic criteria or parameters must be fixed, failing which such an exercise will lead to utter confusion. It will be more appropriate to await the enactment of Data Protection Act and Rules which may provide an objective criterion while dealing with such pleas. A division bench of justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P Velmurugan ordered notice to the high court registry returnable by four weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/man-appeals-against-order-rejecting-plea-to-redact-name/articleshow/87594190.cms||---

The hearing of the case, which was transferred from sessions court to the ADJ court, started after lunch time and continued till the court’s time was over. The next hearing has been scheduled for Tuesday. The alleged fraud took place about 8-9 years ago. Chaudhuri, who retired in 2013, sold two hotels worth Rs200 crore in Jaisalmer at a much lower price of Rs25 crore after declaring them the non-performing assets. After Chaudhuri, who was brought by police here from Delhi, was produced in the lower court, his counsel moved a bail application. CJM Hanuman Sahai Jat dismissed the bail plea after a brief hearing and ordered Chaudhuri to be sent to judicial custody till November 15. The former SBI chief was then taken to the district Jail. Choudhary is in Jawahar Hospital as his health had deteriorated. The advocates of Godawan group of hotels demanded to produce criminal records of Chaudhuri in the court and the additional court issued orders after which the public prosecutor wrote to the Jaisalmer SP requesting the criminal records. Another accused, Alchemist director Alok Dhir, got a transit bail till November 9 from the Delhi High Court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/loan-scam-sbi-ex-chiefs-bail-plea-hearing-to-continue-today/articleshow/87594189.cms||---

The deceased were identified as Vinay Kori, 30, Sushil Gupta, 26, Devendra Jadhav, 28, Anish Jadhav, 24, and Rajan Jadhav, 30, said a police officer. According to the FIR filed by Gupta’s father, Ramprakash, a native of Banda in Uttar Pradesh, Tushar Rastogi, the owner, and Shivanshu Rastogi, the manager of Tuttsan Pharma Private Limited, did not provide any safety gear and were negligent in making the workers enter the ETP, which led to their deaths. The workers died inside an ETP tank at the factory on Plot 10 of Block 58 near Olympic Laminates in Khatraj. In-charge inspector of Santej police M B Jadeja said the incident took place at around 1.30pm on Saturday when the labourers entered the ETP tank to fix a pipe,” said Jadeja. Sushil and Vinay entered the tank first and after they screamed for help on feeling suffocation due to some noxious gas, the three others — Devendra, Anish and Rajan — entered to rescue them but they too died inside the tank. Ramprakash in his FIR said that no one from the company— neither the manager nor any supervisor — was at the site and no safety measures were in place. He said that the owner of the factory and the manager did not visit the crime scene either. Santej police registered a complaint of culpable homicide not amounting to murder against Tushar and Shivanshu along with the charges under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and began an investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/five-workers-die-in-effluent-treatment-plant-owner-booked/articleshow/87594223.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Padma Shri for 5 from Raj||Jaipur: Five persons from Rajasthan were awarded Padma Shri 2020 in different categories by President Ram Nath Kovind at the President’s House on Monday. The awardees are — Himmata Ram Bhambhu (Social Work), Usha Chaumar (Social Work), Ustad Anwar Khan Mangniyar (Art), Munna Master (Art), Sundaram Verma (Social Work). The announcement was made in January 2020. Born in Sukhwasi village in Nagaur, Bhambhu is a renowned environmentalist known for developing an integrated agroforestry plantation. “His major contribution is running campaigns for saving peacocks, chinkaras and other rare creatures from poachers, along with mobilising people in the conservation of forests in Nagaur, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Sikar and Ajmer,” says a document. The only woman among the awardees, Chaumar has fought against the evil practice of manual scavenging and ended the practice among women in Alwar. She was engaged in manual scavenging since childhood and continued it after her marriage. Her life turned around in 2003 when she met the founder of Sulabh International Dr Bideshwar Pathak, who motivated women to adopt alternative ways of livelihood. The Baeeya village, from where Padma Shri Ustad Anwar Khan belongs, sat glued to their TV sets to see their village member receiving the Padma Shri. Khan’s singing has an important contribution in taking the folk songs of Thar to international level. Recently, RSS Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat, during his Barmer stay, went to Khan’s house and enjoyed bhajans and Sufi songs sung by Khan. Another singer, who made it to the list, is from Jaipur. Ramzan Khan alias Munna Master from Bagru has been evoking religious solace for the devotees by his bhajans and people from his town cheered his win. Khan has been carrying forward the family legacy of singing Ram-Krishna bhajans in temples for a living. He has authored a book ‘Shri Shyam Surabhi Vandana’ with bhajans on Lord Krishna, Ram, Vishnu and Shiva. Verma contributed to growing trees in the arid regions by utilising bare minimum water, which has given him the national prestige of an expert in dryland farming. He has grown over 50,000 trees in the desert by conserving water and using his innovative irrigation techniques. “He has mastered an expertise in growing a sapling in just one litre of water,” says the document.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/padma-shri-for-5-from-raj/articleshow/87594208.cms||---

---||Pune||Call on further ease in curbs next month: Maharashtra minister Rajesh Tope||PUNE: State health minister Rajesh Tope on Monday said any further relaxation of existing timings or capacity for various sectors would be examined in the first week of December. Tope said though daily Covid infections were in the 800-1,000 range and active cases were around 15,000 after Diwali, the state government would go slow on declaring further relaxations for any sector. “There has been a lot of crowding during the festivities. We should keep a close watch on the rise in cases in any cluster, and continue to follow testing, tracking, treatment and vaccination as has been the policy earlier,” said Tope. He added that after Dasara and Diwali festivities, a wait-and-watch module would be adopted till the month-end to check if the numbers continued to remain the same. “We will sit with the CM for a further review only in the coming month to decide on further relaxations, provided the cases continue to reduce further and there is no marked rise anywhere ,” he said. He said it was better not to make any immediate changes in November after the festivities though sectors such as theatres and auditoriums were demanding 100 per cent seating capacity and so were the locals. “We will make a review under the CM in the first week (of December) to decide on any additional changes or relaxations,” he said. According to public health department data, in the past three days of the first week of November, Maharashtra registered a three-digit figure in the daily positive cases, which is a good sign, according to state health experts. State surveillance expert Dr Pradip Awate said Maharashtra’s positivity rate was below 2%, and the genomic sequence carried out since May had not shown any major genetic change in the virus. “A close watch is being kept. If there is no significant change in the virus, there is a little chance of a surge. Having said that, the global picture presents a different frame with countries such as the UK, US, Romania, Germany and China seeing another surge. Thus, there is a need to strictly follow protocols,” he said. Ten districts are showing single-digit cases, while another 10 are showing double-digit cases with the state’s weekly positivity rate below 2%. Maharashtra Covid task force member Dr Rahul Pandit has advised a cautious approach on any further relaxations, as Diwali festivities witnessed massive crowds. He said, “We have to keep a close watch on variants or spike in cases in any clusters in the coming two weeks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/call-on-further-ease-in-curbs-next-month-tope/articleshow/87593508.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Presiding over a review meeting through video conferencing, the CM said a large number of devotees participated in fairs of Kartik month, including Chhath Mahaparv. “In such a situation, systematic arrangements should be made for cleanliness, security, lighting, parking and drinking water on the ghats,” he said. The CM directed the authorities to ensure that people do not face any problem in getting permission for organising fairs, since it was an “integral part of our culture and tradition”. He cited the example of ‘Panchkosi’ and ‘Chaudah Kosi parikrama’, which will start in Ayodhya from November 14. “Garhmukteshwar fair will be organised in Hapur, Dev Deepawali in Varanasi on November 19, and Dadri fair in Ballia. Similarly, various fairs are scheduled in Etah, Bareilly, Kanpur and Rae Bareli,” the CM said while instructing the authorities to ensure implementation of Covid-19 protocol. Yogi also emphasised on the need for setting up night shelters in view of dip in temperature. “Very cold weather is expected this year. Nodal officers should be appointed. Police, in association with local municipal body, should ensure that not a single poor/desperate person sleeps on footpath, crossroads or under any statue,” he said. The CM said adequate fodder should be ensured for stray cattle. Speaking on Covid-19 vaccination drive, he said the administration of the first dose vaccine to 100% eligible population (15 crore people) would be over by November-end. He said Covid management in UP was getting global appreciation due to collective efforts. So far, the state has given at least one dose to 9.95 crore people. In such a situation, the target of 25-30 lakh doses per day has been set by the state government. Yogi said the vaccination work should continue till 10pm in all the districts. “All necessary efforts should be made to achieve the target. If the progress in achieveing vaccination target is not found satisfactory, the district magistrate and chief medical officer of the district concerned will be held accountable,” he said. He also sought cooperation of public representatives, from village heads to MPs, in stepping up vaccination drive. “Vaccination should be done with the micro target of ‘first dose saturated gram’. In urban wards, it is necessary to work in mission mode with the spirit of ‘first dose saturated ward’,” the CM said. According to officials, over 75% people have been given the first dose of the vaccine in Gautam Budh Nagar, Shahjahanpur, Ghaziabad, Lucknow and Jhansi. Terming the situation “commendable”, Yogi underscored the need for improving the pace of vaccination in Firozabad, Ballia, Moradabad, Sambhal, Rampur, Aligarh, Sonbhadra, Hapur, Azamgarh and Farrukhabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-announces-public-holidays-on-chhath-and-kartik-purnima/articleshow/87594228.cms||---

---||Delhi||UP, Haryana to blame for Yamuna froth: Delhi Jal Board vice-chairman Raghav Chadha||NEW DELHI: Delhi Jal Board’s vice-chairman Raghav Chadha on Monday said that he was “anguished” to see the frothing of the Yamuna and urged the governments of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to take steps to stop releasing untreated water into the river. “While Delhi government has left no stone unturned in bettering the situation, the states of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana are not bothered,” he claimed. The reaction from the DJB vice-chairperson came after residents of Delhi woke up to witness the Yamuna covered with a thick layer of toxic foam. “It appears that the governments of UP and Haryana are not bothered about how they are releasing untreated wastewater into the Yamuna. DJB has been constantly working to further enhance and augment its sewage treatment plant capacities so that untreated effluents are not released into the river,” said Chadha in a statement. Earlier, DJB had reported the problem of high levels of ammonia in the raw Yamuna water which caused its four major water treatment plants grinding to a halt. This caused disruption to water supply causing immense problems to residents in many parts of the city. According to Chadha, water filled with huge amounts of surfactants falls in Kalindi Kunj from a height, which produces foam. Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai blamed the BJP-led Haryana government for the formation of toxic foam in the Yamuna and said leaders of the saffron party here should seek answers from the neighbouring state. Pictures and videos of devotees standing in waist-deep toxic froth in the Yamuna at Kalindi Kunj here went viral on Monday, with opposition BJP in Delhi blaming the AAP government for the “poisonous” water and air in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/chadha-up-haryana-to-blame-for-yamuna-froth/articleshow/87593537.cms||---
---||Lucknow||KGMU makes kidney cancer detection easy||Lucknow: Experts at King George’s Medical University (KGMU) have developed a non-invasive method to detect kidney cancer, which will not only help in early detection of the disease but also suggest treatment protocol. Besides, the risk of infections will be negligible in comparison to the conventional invasive method of biopsy. “We have developed a non-invasive method using Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI). Our initial study on a small sample size has found the method to be effective. Now an advanced study is being done on a larger sample to establish its efficacy,” said Prof Durgesh Dwivedi, department of radiodiagnosis, who led the study. “It is a first of its kind method in the world for detecting kidney cancer. It will also suggest which medicines can be given to patients with least side effects. The findings of our pioneering research study have recently been published in the high-impact and peer reviewed International Journal of Cancer and Clinical Research,” he added. “Traditionally, biopsy is done to confirm cancer in kidney cells. In this procedure, tissues of the tumour on the kidney are taken out by inserting a needle. However, since cancer patients are immune-compromised, there are chances of infection in inserting a needle in the organ as it cuts into the tissues,” he said. On the other hand, DCE-MRI — an advanced version of MRI — is a combination of non-invasive imaging, genomics and radiomix. Using this technique, experts identified biomarkers for kidney cancer. Thereafter, the DCE-MRI was done on 49 patients suspected to be suffering from kidney cancer. The results indicated that these patients had cancer. “Simultaneously, these patients also underwent biopsy tests, the results of which confirmed cancer. This proved that the diagnosis done through DCE-MRI is as effective as biopsy. Now we are conducting advanced study on a larger sample of patients to further consolidate our findings. Thereafter, we will start using the technique on patients,” said Prof Dwivedi. As part of the study, experts also conducted DCE-MRI of 19 other patients who had already been diagnosed with cancer through biopsy and were under medication for some time. The objective of this research was to examine how effective drugs and therapies (anti-angiogenic and immune) are in preventing growth of cancer cells in these patients. “The DCE-MRI results were analysed along with genetics and observable physical properties of the patients.

The Ahmedabad-based company will supply the vaccine at Rs 265 per dose and the needle-free applicator at Rs 93 per dose, excluding goods and services tax (GST). “The pricing has been decided in consultation with the government of India,” the company said. In August this year, the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) had granted the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to ZyCoV-D for inoculating adults and children in the age group of 12-18 years. Developed indigenously, ZyCoV-D is a three-dose needle free vaccine and also the first DNA plasmid vaccine in the world for human use. “We are happy to support the government’s vaccination programme with ZyCoV-D. The needle-free application of the vaccination, we hope, will motivate many more to vaccinate and safeguard themselves from Covid-19, especially children and young adults in the age group of 12 to 18 years,” said Dr. Sharvil Patel, managing director, Zydus Cadila. The vaccine, according to the company, has shown good stability at temperatures of around 25 degrees for at least three months. The thermostability of the vaccine will help in easy transportation and storage of the vaccine without any problems of fluctuations in temperature. “For prolonged use, a temperature of 2-8 degrees is sufficient. Also being a DNA plasmid vaccine, ZyCoV-D doesn’t have any problem associated with vector-based immunity. The DNA plasmid platform allows generating new construct quickly to deal with mutations in the virus,” the company said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/zydus-to-supply-1-crore-vax-doses-to-centre/articleshow/87594237.cms||---

Like government employees and teachers, every student who attends classes should mark their biometric attendance on entering the school everyday to get the ‘Amma Vodi’ benefit. In a bid to increase the literacy rate and reduce dropout rates, the state government started depositing Rs 15,000 in the accounts of mothers of the school-going children from the below poverty line (BPL) families. The scheme received huge response from the parents. But the government later noticed that many parents enrolled their children in schools just to avail ‘Amma Vodi’ benefit and were not sending their wards to the schools regularly. In a bid to check this, the education department framed new guidelines which include 75 per cent attendance mandatory for a student to become eligible for ‘Amma Vodi.’ Authorities implemented biometric attendance system in Krishna district on Monday as a pilot project. Altogether, 130 working days have been fixed for the academic year 2021-22 from November 8, 2021 to April 23, 2022 and every student must attend school for 98 days and mark biometric attendance to get ‘Amma Vodi’ incentive. Authorities in the education department welcomed the move. Meanwhile, parents and teachers’ associations are opposing the biometric system. “Biometric attendance will add burden on teachers. We are uploading many sheets and photos on mobile apps including the photos of toilets. Now we are asked to register biometric attendance. Servers and the internet are very slow in rural areas and it is very tough to register the attendance of every student,” said S Nageawara Rao, a government teacher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/schools-start-biometric-system-for-students/articleshow/87592794.cms||Venu Lanka

It is a trivial matter in which no offence of grievous nature is involved.The judge observed that it is not the case of police that the petitioner was affected by Covid-19 at the time of occurrence. Therefore, the judge rejected the contention of the prosecution that the petitioner roaming in the road during the pandemic period would result in spread of the infection.Taking into account the facts and circumstances of the case and that the government has taken a decision to drop all these cases which have been registered against the public during the pandemic, the judge quashed the FIR .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/fir-against-man-for-violating-lockdown-norms-quashed-by-hc/articleshow/87594231.cms||---
---||Madurai||Stalin favouring Kerala on Mullaiperiyar Dam to become Dy PM with CPM’s support: Annamalai||Theni: BJP state president K Annamalai while condemning Tamil Nadu government’s decision to release water from Mullaperiyar dam in favour of Kerala alleged that chief minister M K Stalin has pledged the rights over Mullaiperiyar Dam to Kerala with the dream of becoming deputy Prime Minister in 2024 with the support of the CPI (M), which is in power in the neighbouring state. He was speaking at the protest in front of the district collectorate on Monday.Annamalai added that Stalin’s dream will not come true. Talking to reporters, he said that Stalin should apologize to the famers of the five districts depending on water from the dam for irrigation as he betrayed their trust. BJP will not seize till the CM apologizes and ensures that water storage in the dam is raised to the permitted limit of 142 feet, he said.Annamalai said that water was released from the dam on October 29 in the presence of two ministers from Kerala and only a junior engineer from Tamil Nadu, which is against the practice. Instead, collectors of Theni and Idukki and ministers of both states should be present for the process. He also said that the Supreme Court had stated that water should not be released from the dam till the water level had reached 138.5 feet.“Dead storage level of the dam is 108 feet and the dam will have 15 TMC water only when the level reaches 152 feet. Five TMC was lost when the storage capacity was reduced to 142 feet and another five TMC when it was reduced to 136 feet. The area irrigated by the dam when storage was to its full capacity was 2.41 lakh acres. It has now shrunk to 71,000 acres over the years,” Annamalai said.Meanwhile, he denied allegations that the BJP despite being a national party is taking different stands in different states like their Kerala unit is in favour of demolishing the existing Mullaiperiyar Dam and building a new one and their Karnataka unit is going against Tamil Nadu over River Cauvery and Mekedatu Dam issues. He said that the BJP government at the Centre resolved the Cauvery issue by forming the committee and appointing the chairman. Stalin should apologise to the people of Tamil Nadu for brining disgrace to the state by writing a letter thanking the Kerala CM for granting permission to axe a few trees to strengthen Baby Dam, he said. “Any letter the CM writes is on behalf of the 8.5 crore people of Tamil Nadu and this letter has brought shame to all of us,” he said. On Monday morning water level in Periyar Dam stood at 138.45 feet against 138.5 feet on Sunday. The inflow was 1,629 cusecs against the outflow of 1,867 cusecs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/stalin-favouring-kerala-on-mullaiperiyar-dam-to-become-dy-pm-with-cpms-support-annamalai/articleshow/87594246.cms||---

Navi Mumbai cops give tips on how to keep crooks at bay||NAVI MUMBAI: After the crime branch busted an inter-state gang of high-tech car thieves, the Navi Mumbai police has sent out an advisory for car manufacturers, pre-owned car buyers, financial institutions, insurance companies and e-commerce firms, suggesting steps to be taken to prevent car theft . Sunil Shinde, senior inspector of crime branch unit-1, who busted the gang, said, “As the car thieves use an electronic gadget to scan and decode the ignition key, car manufacturers should ensure that an OTP is generated when the key is decoded, alerting the owner.” Car thieves take chassis and engine numbers of vehicles that are damaged in accidents and sold to scrap dealers by insurance companies, and print those on stolen vehicles. Insurance companies should inform the RTO of scrapped vehicles, so their registration can be cancelled. Financial companies that provide loans for pre-owned vehicles should personally verify the chassis and engine numbers, as should insurance companies. Shinde said, “Those buying pre-owned vehicles should verify the vehicle colour, model, manufacturing year on the Vahan web portal of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. Buyers should meet the vehicle owner and verify original documents and insurance. Engine control module and engine control unit should be checked to ensure that engine and chassis numbers are not manipulated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/buying-a-car-cops-give-tips-on-how-to-keep-crooks-at-bay-in-mumbai/articleshow/87593765.cms||George Mendonca

The minister condemned the allegations by opposition parties of teachers being forced to clean the toilets. Suresh said the reforms brought in by the Andhra Pradesh government are a role model for the rest of the country and alleged that opposition parties unable to digest praise of the state government are circulating morphed pictures of teachers cleaning toilets. “The state government has transformed schools into model institutions and developed top class infrastructure under the Mana Badi Nadu-Nedu scheme. Ayahs have been employed at 45,716 schools till date for cleaning the toilets,” Suresh said. An ‘ayah’ each will be employed at schools with a student strength below 300. Two ‘ayahs’ will be employed in schools with a student strength up to 600, he added. Each ‘ayah’ will be paid a Rs 6,000 salary and proper tools and chemicals for cleaning toilets will be provided, the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/toilets-cleaned-by-ayahs-not-teachers-says-minister/articleshow/87592814.cms||Venu Lanka

He also said that people of Chennai and the delta region have not forgotten the struggles they faced without electricity for 10 days and were forced to stay on their roofs and wait for food when cyclones struck the state during the AIADMK government.Ramachandran highlighted the preparedness by the state government during its first five months in power to handle floods and other natural disasters by cleaning the stormwater drains. This has ensured that water drained from inundated areas quickly.After inspecting canal cleaning works in Madurai on Monday, as part of the monsoon preparedness in Madurai to ensure that rain water reached the tanks and lakes, Moorthy responded to Jayakumar, saying that Stalin along with ministers and senior officials visited the lakes that were getting filled up on Sunday and directed them on what needs to be done.“This is unlike the AIADMK regime when water was not released from Chembarambakkam lake saying they have not got the nod from then CM Jayalalithaa and finally resulted in the lake breaching its bund,” he said. The AIADMK organising secretary Jayakumar had commented on Sunday that one rain in Chennai has exposed the DMK government. “People know how long it has been raining,” Moorthy added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tn-ministers-in-war-of-words-with-former-aiadmk-counterparts/articleshow/87594251.cms||---

They alleged that the garbage including old stock of unsold flowers such as marigold coupled with rainwater has resulted in an unpleasant odour emanating from the market, contrary to the fragrance expected from flowers.“Since it is rainy marigold flowers get damaged easily and those left unsold continue to be dumped here. The market committee that runs the complex is collecting money from us for maintenance but has not cleared the tonnes of garbage,” said another trader.A solid waste management unit located on the complex premises is defunct, adding to the misery of the stakeholders. Corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan said that the market committee has given a request letter to the corporation on Monday to clear the piles of waste. The first load of garbage will be collected by the early hours of Tuesday and waste collection will be done on a daily basis thereafter.The commissioner explained that the civic body does not collect garbage from the flower market complex as it belongs to a private entity (the committee). The committee collects money from the traders for waste disposal and upkeep of the market premises. Since it is operated as a private entity they will have to pay the cost fixed by the civic body for the purpose of regularly clearing their waste.“The cost will soon be fixed after administrative procedures. The clearing will not be hindered till then,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/20t-of-rotten-flowers-uncleared-from-mattuthavani-market/articleshow/87594250.cms||---

Addressing state governments across the world in Scotland, Maharashtra’s environment minister Aaditya Thackeray stated that being India’s most developed state, Maharashtra plans to exceed expectations on the timeline of going carbon-neutral. “Maharashtra is taking the lead to reach net-zero at the earliest, so that the rest of our country has the room to go through rapid industrialisation and then reach net-zero as per Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision. As a government, the state will inspire confidence in investors and businesses to commit to climate action and to usher in a new era of sustainable development,” the minister said, adding that Maharashtra will lead the example of how climate action and thriving industry can co-exist. After bagging the prestigious award, Thackeray along with world leaders, committed to strong climate actions by 2030. “The commitments under this include providing support to cities to go net-zero by 2050, preparing a state climate change action plan, 100% of new public fleet purchases to be zero-emission by 2030 in major regions, empowering disadvantaged communities to develop local, scalable climate solutions, improving representation of women in climate change-related governance structure...,” said an official.

The body of the victim, identified as Masli Bhil, was found atop a cliff on Diwali day, following which her family members were informed. Police initially suspected that she died an accidental death, but later her brother alleged that her husband Desing Bhil and Kursiya Bhil had killed her. Police booked the father-son duo and took them in for questioning. During interrogation, they admitted that they had killed Masli as they had a superstition that she was a witch. “Four years ago, Desing’s elder brother Raising died of snake bite. Since then, they had been blaming the woman for it,” said sub-inspector M S Dihora of Kawant police station. “They used to tell the woman that she was a witch and had turned into a snake to kill the man,” he added. Fed up with the constant harassment, Masli had gone to live with her brother some days before her death. But as her seven-year-old son was at Desing’s home she returned to her husband’s home. “Her brother had warned her against going back to her husband as they had threatened to harm her. The woman, however, went because of her son and was murdered,” Dihora said. The two accused strangulated her to death sometime between November 3 night and November 4 and dumped her body on a cliff near the village to avoid any suspicion. On Monday, the two accused were sent to judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/branded-as-witch-woman-killed-by-husband-in-law/articleshow/87593553.cms||---

The Air Quality Index (AQI) rose to 338 as air quality deteriorated from ‘poor’ to ‘very poor’ category. The city’s AQI had crossed the 300 mark on February 8 year when it recorded AQI 343. Weather experts said the spike in air pollution was due to PM2.5 pollutant, emitted from firecrackers on Diwali night, getting trapped in the air due to drop in day and night temperatures.  Besides, construction activities and vehicular traffic have also contributed to rise in pollution levels. “PM 2.5 is an ultrafine pollutant that doesn’t easily disperse in the atmosphere for a week. Further, vehicular load and traffic snarls also led to increase in pollution in the city,” said chief scientist, Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, GC Kisku. The city witnessed jump in air pollution levels by 40 units in a day. The air pollution level in major areas like Gomtinagar, Indiranagar, Talkatora touched 400 units in the late evening hours. Even many UP cities have air under ‘severe’ or ‘very poor’ category. Agra was the most air-polluted city in the country on Monday (AQI 486).

The Mumbai Public Schools at Antop Hill and Vikhroli have bagged the ‘Climate Action Project School of Excellence’ award by international NGO World Wide Fund (WWF) that works in the field of wilderness preservation, and Cartoon Network Climate Champions, a climate change awareness initiative. The project aims to help students learn about the climate crisis in authentic ways and disseminate solutions online. Recognized schools had met extensive criteria, including a school-wide commitment to climate education and student solutions. Teachers and students up to class 6 of MPS School, Hariyali Village in Vikhroli focused on buying local, avoiding excess packaging, minimising usage of products that do not decompose. Students interacted with their counterparts in countries like Spain, Canada, Indonesia, Nigeria, Vietnam and Sri Lanka. School representative Neelam Ajgaonkar said that global warming is our reality and we all have to respond to it. Students of MPS School at Antop Hill spent over six weeks conducting various activities related to climate change, exploring causes and effects of global warming and planting medicinal herbs as a solution to mitigate climate issues. They interacted with students from Malaysia and Portugal. The school’s representative, Swapna Yadav, said they aim to make the school eco-friendly to protect the planet. Students came up with solutions like saving gas and reducing its emission into the air by encouraging walking and cycling, use of electric cars, minimising air conditioners and switching to solar energy. The online event held last Thursday was attended by over 2.5 lakh people across the globe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-bmc-schools-bag-global-prize-for-climate-projects/articleshow/87593561.cms||---

A girl student sustained injury on her head during the scuffle in which several others were taken into custody. The SSBN students gathered to protest the privatisation of aided sections in the college. They claimed the move would increase college fees significantly. Cops reached the spot and found around 500 students gathered at the campus. They tried to explain that no such government order has been issued yet. But the students claimed the college management has given an option to give up the aided status. Videos showed cops caning students and even dragging a student by his collar to the police vehicle. During the scuffle, a student identified as Navya was seen receiving first aid after sustaining injury. TDP supremo N Chandrababu Naidu tweeted the circulating videos and wrote, “It is very unfair to torture students who agitate peacefully to protect their educational institution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/police-cane-protesting-college-students-1-hurt/articleshow/87592827.cms||---

Schools said that that more students are expected to come in the next few days. “We are recording around 70% attendance now. There are still around 20-30% of students who are yet to return. At this point we cannot force them. We are only hoping that in the next few weeks, it gets regularized. For lower classes, parents are dropping off children in school themselves and they are having better attendance,” said the headmaster of a government higher secondary school.“I drop my daughter at her school. With rains, it is difficult to find a safe alternative. Since she has only half a day of classes it makes it difficult for me to step out in the middle of my work and pick her up. In such case, online classes would be preferable till the weather lets up,” said N Srilakshmi, a parent of a Class III student. Though schools have been instructed to allow online classes and not force students to come to school, several parents said that managements are insisting only on coming to school or have their child take leave.Meanwhile, some private schools have postponed the reopening by a week as parents are apprehensive about sending their children due to rains. “We expected more students to come to school only by this week. On Monday, attendance dipped in many schools because of the rain but we expect it to pick up. However, we cannot afford to have schools closed down again,” said M Arumugam, state president, Federation of Private School Associations. Parents are also worried about Covid-19 spread. “Post Diwali, there is fear of cases going up and in this weather, many children get cold and cough. We don’t know how far schools will be responsible in enforcing safety measures. Authorities must monitor and take action if norms are flouted,” said K Rajasekaran, a parent of a Class IX student.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-schools-record-gradual-rise-with-70-attendance/articleshow/87594271.cms||---
---||Delhi||Quality dip: Frothing at the mouth, Yamuna river doesn’t meet safe standards||NEW DELHI: Devotees stood waist-deep in water amid white froth bobbing up and down on the Yamuna’s surface at Kalindi Kunj on Monday. The conditions couldn’t have been less salubrious on the first day of Chhath puja, but it wasn’t surprising. The latest report of Delhi Pollution Control Committee, prepared in October, clearly says that the Yamuna’s water quality does not meet the safe standards with respect to dissolved oxygen (DO) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). The report says that DO, which is the amount of oxygen present in the river, was measured at below the healthy mark of 5mg/l at the eight monitoring stations along the river’s length in Delhi. The DO at Palla, where the Yamuna enters the city, was 4.6mg/l but dropped to nil when the river reached last two monitoring stations after passing the Shahdara drain inflow and the confluence of the Shahdara and Tughlakabad drains at Asgarpur. While low OD affects aquatic life, high BOD indicates low water quality that has inadequate oxygen for species that require the gas. The prescribed standard of BOD in the Yamuna is 3mg/l or less, but it was as high as 34mg/l at ISBT bridge, 40mg/l at Agra Canal at Okhla), 58mg/l downstream of Okhla barrage and 54mg/l at Asgarpur. The Yamuna Monitoring Committee (now dissolved) had explained to National Green Tribunal last year that the primary reason for froth formation in the Yamuna was the high phosphate content in detergents finding their way into the river through drains. Bhim Singh Rawat, a Yamuna activist and member of South Asia Network on Dams, River and People, told TOI, “For Diwali, people cleaned their homes using soaps and detergents containing chemicals and these entered the river. Sewage treatment plants primarily process sewage, not the chemicals released from households and industries illegally operating in non-conforming areas. The river also has a high level of ammonia.” River activist Manoj Mishra of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan said, “In Delhi, the Yamuna water upstream of Wazirabad is different from water downstream of Wazirabad. Upstream between Palla and Wazirabad barrage, the water is comparatively cleaner as it is drinking water.” Downstream, the water is poor round the year, except during monsoon because the Yamuna carries dirty water, including industrial effluents and waste from households. Mishra said, “The level of DO and BOD on this stretch is of very poor quality and people stood in this water on Monday.” To prevent frothing and pollution in Yamuna, Delhi government banned the sale, storage, transportation and marketing of soaps and detergent had did not meet Bureau of Indian Standards benchmarks in June. “However, the ban has not been properly implemented.” alleged Rawat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/quality-dip-frothing-at-the-mouth-river-doesnt-meet-safe-standards/articleshow/87593574.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Harshada is the sister-in-law of NCB Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede. On Monday, Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik posted a tweet, with screenshots of e-court records, asking a question to Wankhede whether his sister-in-law was involved in the drug business? While the court records uploaded on the website show it to be a case under Sections 3, 4, 5 and 8 of the NDPS Act, Gupta told TOI, “This appears to be a case of typographical error. It’s a case of PITA provisions and our records reflect the same. Our police team is taking up the matter with the court officials.” The Pune police also issued a release stating that the then social security cell inspector Rajendra Bhamre and his team had raided a room in a plush star hotel in the Bund Garden police area and had arrested Redkar and the two others on October 13, 2007, under the PITA provisions. Later, an FIR for offences under Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the PITA was registered. A chargesheet was filed on January 14, 2008, against the three accused and the matter is pending before the magisterial court, the statement said. A retired police officer, who was involved in the raid, told TOI, “We raided the hotel after receiving a tip-off that two models and an escort were present in the hotel room and were in the prostitution racket. We raided the spot after a decoy customer confirmed a deal with the trio. At that time, we were not aware if the model was the sister of a Marathi film actress. We never found any drugs during the raid.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/case-against-wankhedes-sister-in-law-2-others-not-under-ndps-act-pune-police-chief/articleshow/87593576.cms||---

Even as the dry grass caught fire, the woman did not move and got engulfed in flames. “We have investigated the CCTV camera footage and it seems that she had deliberately set up the fire for self-immolation. After the fire started, she did not move away and her body too was found just a few metres away from where the fire had started,” said sub-inspector B S Shelana of Manjalpur fire station. Police did not find any wirings or electric fittings which may have caused the fire at the spot. The cop added that the woman may have been tired of living in penury and decided to end her life. A native of Dahod district, Santu was living in the premises of the unit involved in metal plating work for the last four years. Police said that her sons had abandoned her so she had come to Vadodara. The unit owner had allowed her to live within the premises and gave her the job of taking care of the unit. A case of accidental death was registered at Manjalpur police station and her mortal remains were handed over to her sons after the autopsy on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/destitute-woman-dies-in-fire-at-makarpura-gidc/articleshow/87593578.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Vijayawada||VMRDA master plans get government nod||Visakhapatnam: The state government approved the perspective plan-2051 and master plan-2041 along with zoning development promotion regulations for the Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA) on Monday. The VMRDA had first issued a notification of the draft perspective plan-2051 and draft master plan-2041 on June 15 by giving 30 days’ time (from June 16 to July 15) for the public to submit their objections and suggestions. Based on the representations from several people’s representatives and organisations within the purview of the urban body, the VMRDA extended the deadline for objections by 15 more days, i.e. from July 16 to 31. However, it was extended further to August 7 and then to August 23 due to varied reasons such as making these draft plans available in Telugu language and others. Consequently, the state government constituted an expert technical committee to review and make suggestions on objections/suggestions received on these plans from the public. According to the VMRDA officials, they received 17,460 objections from the general public as well as officials from other line departments such as irrigation, forest, revenue and others. The majority of the objections were related to the master plan roads proposed in the suburbs. The VMRDA conducted a joint inspection by duly involving the revenue officials and other concerned departments between August 10 and 18. The objections and suggestions have been verified by the field staff and cross-checked by the head of the section concerned. Meanwhile, the technical committee constituted by the state government conducted a series of meetings and offered their inputs and recommendations on the objections received on the draft master plan and perspective plan. The committee verified the extensive road network proposed in the VMRDA development area, and suggested certain modifications to the network asking the VMRDA to tilise the existing roads. The state government, in its orders on Monday, directed the metropolitan commissioner to ensure that a copy of the master plan and perspective plan is made available at the VMRDA office and offices of the urban local bodies in the VMRDA’s jurisdiction for the public for inspection. The plans and zoning development promotion regulations will come into force from Monday itself .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vmrda-master-plans-get-government-nod/articleshow/87592852.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The Goa State Expert Appraisal Committee (GSEAC) carried out a site inspection on September 28 and found a beneficiation unit to process mined iron ore was set up without the required permissions. The alleged violator has now been asked to carry out a detailed study of the impact the violation has had on the local environment. An environment impact assessment (EIA) and an environment management plan (EMP) have been sought for the plant, covering 10km radius of area around it. The GSEAC has said that the report should also state the mitigation measures that need to be taken to minimise the adverse environmental impact caused by setting up of the plant. Sources said that the alleged violator sought permissions for the plant after starting the process to set it up, which led to the discovery of the violation. “A study area map of the core zone as well as the 10km area of buffer zone showing major industries/mines and other polluting sources should be submitted. These maps shall also indicate the migratory corridors of fauna, if any, and areas of endangered fauna; plants of medicinal and economic importance, any ecologically sensitive areas within the 10 km buffer zone: the shortest distance from the national park/wildlife sanctuary, tiger reserve, etc, along with the comments of the chief wildlife warden of the state government,” GSEAC has said, after discussing the site inspection details at its meeting held on October 20. The committee has also asked that air, noise, soil, groundwater and surface water studies be carried out, besides seeking details from the mining company of the public hearing for the project carried out and the objections raised by the public. “A detailed action plan for corporate social responsibility for the project affected people and people living in and around the project area should be provided. Permission of drawl of water shall be prerequisite for consideration of EC,” the violating company has been told by the GSEAC. The entire sequence of mineral production, transportation, handling, transfer and storage of mineral and waste, if any, and their impacts on air quality should be shown in a flow chart. The chart should indicate specific points where fugitive emissions can arise, the committee has told the company. Specific pollution control or mitigation measures should be proposed to be put in place at each point where any emissions can occur, the GSEAC has said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/iron-ore-mining-shut-but-firm-in-violation-at-dharbandora/articleshow/87593584.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Truck drivers tank up outside state to avoid high fuel rates||Mumbai: Several transporters have decided to minimise purchase of expensive diesel in Maharashtra when vehicles are in transit while transporting goods from one neighbouring state to another. “The rate of diesel is cheaper in Gujarat, Goa, Madhya Pradesh,Karnataka etc which is why most transporters have decided to fill up fuel in neighbouring states before entering Maharashtra and refrain as much as possible to buy fuel from this state,” said Bal Malkit Singh from All India Motor Transport Congress. Another senior transporter said that truckers, if need be, will fabricate extra fuel tanks so that need for refuelling from the state could be avoided. “This way, sales of fuel in the state will decline considerably leading to revenue loss to the state exchequer,” warned senior transporters from the association. In few neighbouring states, the drop in diesel price was as huge as Rs 17 to Rs 19 a litre. This is because apart from the drop of Rs 10 announced by the Centre on Excise Duty on fuel, the states have themselves reduced local taxes/VAT on fuel which is why there has been a further drop in rates. In Maharashtra, after the reduction in Central excise duty ( Rs 10 drop) on fuel the price of diesel dropped by Rs 12.48 per litre last week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-truck-drivers-tank-up-outside-state-to-avoid-high-fuel-rates/articleshow/87593592.cms||Somit Sen

The effort is part of the initiative ‘Moving Boundaries’ by ‘bikerni’ Jai Bharathi. Bharathi is touring about 15 cities, covering 11,111km in 40 days. The 39-year-old has so far covered several states including Telangana, Maharashtra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Delhi on her heavy-duty bike weighing around 150kg. “By mobility for women, I mean that women should learn to drive and be in the driving seat,” said Bharathi, whose organisation trains women from weaker sections to drive, free of cost. “Once trained, women can use the skills for better employment opportunities and not depend on other family members for mobility, which in turn improves their self-confidence,” said Bharathi. A native of Hyderabad, Bharathi worked in a UK-based company after becoming an architect. She was fond of biking since an early age. Her brothers and parents supported her and she bought her first bike in 2011. However, her life changed in 2012, when she took part in the ‘Go UNESCO challenge’. She visited different UNESCO heritage sites in India via different modes of transport. “After winning the challenge, I decided to mix my passion for travelling with childhood love for bikes and began making short weekend trips. In this period, I realised how important mobility is for women. Hence, in 2018, I left my job and created a non-profit organization to train women,” she said. During her expeditions, she covers 80-100km daily and connects with organisations and groups working for women’s causes. “Once I wear my gear, people cannot make out if it’s a biker or a ‘bikerni’. It gives me confidence that if I can handle a 150kg bike, I can fight any odds in life,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bikerni-moves-boundaries-on-wheels-to-give-mobility-to-women/articleshow/87594291.cms||---

One revered temple of Goddess Annapurna already exists near the Kashi Vishwanath temple. Divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal told TOI on Sunday, “The ancient idol that has been returned by Canada will be installed in one of the seven temples coming up on the KV Dham premises. These temples have been designed to reinstall the idols preserved during the campus expansion. The date for ‘pran pratistha’ (consecration) of the idol has been fixed as November 15 and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will attend the ceremony.” The idols of Goddess Parvati, Lord Ganesh, Lord Hanuman and Lord Satyanarayan, which were preserved when the construction of KV Dham started for expansion of KVT premises, will also be installed in these temples, he added. The dates of the reinstallation of these idols are being decided. These seven temples are prefabricated and will be placed in KV Dham soon, said officials. The stone idol of Goddess Annapurna had been stolen from Kashi and smuggled to Canada a century ago. In his Mann Ki Baat on November 29, 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the return of this idol from Canada, mentioning it was stolen from a temple of Varanasi and smuggled out somewhere around 1913. Agrawal said the idol will be brought from New Delhi to Varanasi by road and will reach the city by November 14 night. Officials have also geared up preparations for early completion of restoration of 27 temples unearthed during removal of buildings for KV Dham project as well as reinstallation of idols and artefacts found in the process. The Shanidev temple and Shiv Kutcheri outside the southern wall of KVT premises will also be restored. “A Devasthanam (Dev Gallery) is also being created. It will accommodate 27 idols and the artefacts recovered from different buildings. The restoration of 27 temples has also been started,” the commissioner added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/annapurna-idol-from-canada-to-be-installed-in-one-of-7-temples-in-kvt/articleshow/87588573.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

The group of four women has decided to drive over 5,000 kilometres and raise Rs 45 lakh for children and families dealing with paediatric cancer. On their way full of adventure, the group has already countered obstacles like low visibility, high smog, getting lost in absence of direction and getting caught by traffic police for driving in a no-entry zone. “We entered into a no-entry zone and were stopped by a traffic policeman in Lucknow today itself. After a lot of convincing and a warning later, he let us go,” said Chitra, while talking to TOI. She, along with Hansu and Rina, are related to the social sector while Micky is a psychoanalyst. Starting their journey from Mumbai on November 3, the group reached Lucknow on Monday. From here, they will leave for Varanasi on Tuesday. Their endeavour will then take them to Bihar, Odisha, Hyderabad and back to Mumbai. The sum raised will be handed over to the not for profit--The Helping Hands Foundation, that works to provide free accommodation to families of children with cancer and on their post treatment testing and rehabilitation. “We were in Kutch early this year when we came across a group of bike riders who were travelling to raise funds for another cause. We got inspired and decided to mix our passion for driving with a cause close to our hearts,” said Chitra while revealing that they have already raised Rs 25 lakh. En route, the group is meeting doctors, institutions and organisations working for the cause of cancer. “In Indore, we visited the Indian Institute of Heck and Neck Oncology and took note of their model of funding for patients,” she added. In Varanasi, the group will meet three cancer specialists of the Homi Bhabha Cancer hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/60-women-hit-road-for-noble-cause/articleshow/87594310.cms||---

Hundreds of tourists and denizens queued up on Sunday as well as Monday as around five boats owned by APTDC began operations. APTDC officials said that all necessary Covid precautions and passenger safety measurs are being taken. Three out of 16 boats have a capacity of 45 each and two boats have seating capacity of 25 people . Officials said the remaining 11 boats too will begin operations after assessing the requirement. Speaking to TOI, APTDC Vijayawada divisional manager Srinivas Rao said boating service was availed by over 1,300 people on Sunday. “The restaurant and other places in Bhavani Island are open for public. These include Maze Garden and Robotic Park. We will soon operate the remaining boats as well,” Rao said. Boating operations took a hit on Krishna River ever since the boat mishap at Papikondalu. The 2019 flood had damaged Bhavani Island and authorities spent over Rs 1 crore to complete the repair works. Papikondalu boat cruise too resumed on Sunday with extra safety measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/punnami-bhavani-island-boating-resumes/articleshow/87592866.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

This school will impart free training to selected youths from weaver background to groom them as masterweaver-cum-designer, who will be capable of handling all work from designing to manufacturing as per the demands of domestic and international fashion markets, said Shaikh while talking to TOI on the inauguration of the school here on Sunday. “Demand for authentic Banarasi handloom fabrics is very high across the globe. However, the handloom sector of Banarasi textile industry has reduced on 8,000-10,000 looms, which is not sufficient to fulfil such demand,” said Shaikh, who is known in fashion industry for reviving old embroidery, highlighting how the shift of weavers towards powerloom had hit the handloom art. In view of these ground realities, he went through the syllabus of all government and private institutions of textile and fashion technologies, he said adding, after finding that there was meagre focus on developing skills in artisans, he designed a course to carve masterweaver-cum designers. “Under CDA Art Foundation’s `working hand-in-hand’ project, we decided to launch a school in this regard with financial assistance of BC Jindal group. There was no better place than Varanasi to launch it”, said Shaikh, mentioning the school is beginning a three-year full time course, with assurance of job placement, loom and also providing market for the products of passing out students, who should have studied up to minimum class X to join the course. An elderly Zari producer Shyam Sundar, who is also assisting this project and will make the students aware about the history of Banarasi weaving industry and the materials like pure silk, Zari and other used in it, said, “Apart from making students learning the glorious history and tradition of the Banarasi weaving industry, they will also be made aware about the requirements and demands of the industry by the local ‘Gaddidars’ (Banarasi textile traders).” Shaikh said, the students will learn designing for both manual and computer works and also the art of colour combinations. “Internationally known textile experts and designers will also teach them in both online and offline modes. The students will be taught methods of marketing, packaging and online presence to make their reach in both domestic and international markets”, said Shaikh, adding these students will be skilled to work without compromising the original weaving and designs of Banarasi handloom art. The students will get free of cost stationary as well, said Shaikh adding, if the attendance of students will remain above 80% for three months they will be given honorarium in their bank accounts. Before the formal opening of this school, he said, 30 applications had been received from boys and girls from the families of weavers or artisans of auxiliary products of textile industry. He said that he would work with them till November end after which 15 of them would be selected to join the course. Shaikh said that this project is being initiated in Varanasi on experiment basis and if it will yield positive results similar schools will be started at all traditional weaving hubs of India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/guj-master-embroiderer-launches-free-design-weaving-school-for-weavers/articleshow/87588590.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Vadodara||Visually challenged Vadodara man scales 17,000-ft Himalaya peak||Vadodara: He is visually challenged. But support from his friend helped him travel the rugged terrain to scale Mount Friendship, popularly known as Friendship Peak, in Himachal Pradesh. Undeterred by cold winds and freezing temperatures, two friends from Vadodara recently covered the summit at an altitude of 17,346 feet above sea level. “I am into mountaineering. I have climbed mountains in Pavagadh, Jambughoda and Chhota Udepur among others. But the Himalayas is a completely different terrain because of its snowy ranges. I could do it because of my friend,” said Sanjeev Gohil, 43, who works as a postal assistant at the Department of Posts (India Post). Gohil was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, a progressive vision disorder, in 2001. Even as he has lost 100 % vision now, he hasn’t lost passion for forest, wildlife conservation and mountaineering which he cherished before he started losing sight. “It is my passion to be in the forest and mountains. But it is because of my friends that it becomes a reality,” said Gohil. During the five-day expedition, Gohil constantly followed his civil engineer friend Pushpak Kotiya, 33, on his shoulder or with the sling attached to his bag. “The up and down movements of his shoulders helped me judge the next step I had to take. Every step is unpredictable as there are loose rocks and firm rocks. If you mistakenly step into a loose rock, you can slip as well,” said Gohil, who developed a bond with Kotiya thanks to their association with Wildlife Trust. “We had done some mountaineering but scaling Friendship Peak was a challenge because of the snowclad chilling mountains. During the climb, a traveller puts his or her foot into an existing snow step but it became all the more challenging for Sanjeev as he could not see the existing steps. For each step, he required three times more energy than others,” said Kotiya. “My dream is to conquer Mount Everest someday,” added Gohil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/visually-challenged-vadodara-man-scales-17000-ft-himalaya-peak/articleshow/87593605.cms||Prashant Rupera
---||Lucknow||‘Jashn-e-Urdu’ to celebrate a language that has roots in India||Lucknow: In times when a single Urdu word can cast a shadow on brand campaigns and bring about a negative social media frenzy, the Islamic Centre of India (ICI) is organizing a first of its kind ‘Jashn-e-Urdu’ festival in Lucknow on Tuesday on the occasion of World Urdu Day on November 9. The day-long festival with an Urdu book fest, Iqbal seminar and mushaira, is set to apprise people of the past and present glory of the language that took birth in India. The conference will see renowned poets and authors like Wasif Farooqui, Masoodul Hasan Usmani, Sabiha Anwar, Ismar Malihabadi and others give their opinion on the importance and position of Urdu in our freedom struggle and our lives. The mushaira is expected to regale the audiences while the book fair has been organised with the aim to give a platform to Urdu writers, poets and publishers to bring their work to the mainstream. “In this day and age, we need to give Urdu its due. Urdu was born in India and people need to be told that. It should not be looked at as the language of one particular community or region as it is one of the national languages of the country and the state language of Uttar Pradesh,” said ICI chief Maulana Khalid Rashid Farangi Mahali. “The younger generation especially needs to be told about the role of Urdu and Urdu speakers in the freedom struggle. How the slogans of ‘Inquilab Zindabad’ and ‘Jai Hind’ given in Urdu fill people with patriotism even to this day. The unmatched role Urdu newspapers played in the freedom struggle is also brushed under the carpet and we need to apprise everyone,” he added. The event will be held at ICI in Aishbagh from 10 am to 5 pm on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/jashn-e-urdu-to-celebrate-a-language-that-has-roots-in-india/articleshow/87594318.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Leader in electric bus manufacturing in India, Olectra Greentech Limited (Olectra) and Evey Trans Private Limited (EVEY) bagged the big project when Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) gave final green signal for supply of 100 e-buses. The APSRTC will deploy 50 buses at Alipiri (Tirupati) depot to be operated on Tirumala-Tirupati ghat road. The remaining buses will be operated from Tirupati to Nellore, Kadapa, and Madanapalle as intercity buses. APSRTC is planning to procure more buses after studying the feasibility of the pilot project to be implemented in Tirupati. The Olectra and Evey firms received the letter of award from APSRTC on Monday. Olectra and Evey will jointly supply 100 E-buses under the FAME-II scheme launched by the Union government. Olectra will supply 100 E-buses on a Gross Cost Contract (GCC) /OPEX model basis for 12 years. The value of this contract is approximately Rs 140 crore.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Politics heats up as Chhath puja begins||NEW DELHI: Politics over Chhath puja continued unabated as the four-day festival began on Monday. BJP MP Parvesh Sahib Singh defied a Delhi Disaster Management Authority ban by organising the rituals on the Yamuna riverbank near ITO, while fellow MP Manoj Tiwari took a boat ride in the foam-covered water and blamed the AAP government for the river’s toxicity. TimesViewIt is unfortunate that both Chhath puja and pollution are being politicised. Cases of Covid-19 are currently low in the city. But self-restraint and self-denial remain key to keeping it under control.Singh led a group of Purvanchali devotees in the rituals on Monday morning and vowed to create a Chhath site at the riverbank to celebrate the sun festival on November 10-11. Several devotees were seen taking a dip in the foam-covered river. Hitting out at chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Singh said, “The AAP government came to power on the basis of the votes of the Purvanchali community and now the CM is not permitting them to celebrate the pious festival.” DDMA has permitted Chhath puja celebrations in public places across the capital but prohibited devotees from carrying out puja on the Yamuna banks over pollution concerns. BJP and AAP functionaries have argued that Chhath puja causes no water pollution, with the devotees instead cleaning the riverbanks while preparing for the festival. Tiwari said he took the boat ride near Kalindi Kunj to highlight how polluted the Yamuna had become. Later Tiwari went to Sonia Vihar, stood knee-deep in the river and stated that the river there was clean and free of toxic foam. “This leaves the AAP government exposed,” said Tiwari, adding that Delhi government wasn’t bothered about the toxicity and pollution in the river. “The Supreme Court should take suo-motu cognisance of this matter,” the BJP functionary said. The MP claimed that Delhi government had not only banned Chhath devotees from worshipping on the Yamuna riverbanks, but the state government also always made false claims about cleaning the river. Many devotees defied DDMA guidelines to take a dip in the polluted river near Kalindi Kunj. Delhi Jal Board vice-chairman Raghav Chadha alleged that while Delhi government was doing all it could to keep the Yamuna clean, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana were collectively releasing around 150 million gallons per day of untreated wastewater into the river.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/politics-heats-up-as-chhath-puja-begins/articleshow/87593610.cms||---

Quepem police said that Abhishek Hiremath, 25, had sought to take revenge on his former teacher for allegedly beating him up in Standard X while studying at Government high school, Xeldem. Quepem police inspector Deepak Pednekar said that around 3.30am on Monday morning, Hiremath went to the teacher’s residence and entered the house by removing the roof tiles. The accused allegedly first stole Rs 7,000 from the house and later proceeded with his plan to kill the teacher by pouring petrol while she and her husband were asleep, police said. Pednekar said that the accused mistakenly doused the teacher’s husband, but before he could strike the matchstick, the husband woke up and managed to apprehend the accused. He was later handed over to the police. The accused later confessed to committing the crime. The teacher continues to be attached with the school, while her husband is a retired headmaster from Curchorem higher secondary school. Hiremath was arrested for attempt to murder under Sections 307, 457 (house breaking), 380 (theft) and 459 (causing hurt) under the Indian Penal Code. Pednekar told TOI that the accused will be produced before JMFC court on Tuesday for remand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/quepem-local-attempts-to-murder-ex-teacher-as-revenge-for-beating-in-school-held/articleshow/87593599.cms||---

The yatra started on September 15 from Lucknow’s 1090 crossing. By now, the yatra has moved through 75 districts. The purpose of the yatra was to garner public support for the party’s demand for reservation for Nishads in UP. At the same time, it was also meant to remind the state government of its promise to grant SC status to Nishads. Reservation for Nishads is the top agenda of the Nishad party. Though the Yogi government has assured that the legalities are being worked on to make reservation for Nishads in the state possible, the party has planned to continue its fight for it till it is finally done. The party initially had planned to end the yatra in a month’s time but it was extended later. After the yatra was launched on September 15, quite a few political developments changed the equations between the Nishad party and the BJP. The BJP officially announced its alliance with the Nishad Party, made Dr Sanjay Nishad the MLC and has also announced that it is working on the legalities to grant reservation to the Nishad community. Now, Nishad party leaders are planning to have on the dais with them a few senior BJP leaders as well during the maharally. The national party president of the Nishad party, Dr Sanjay Nishad said that he has got assurance from BJP leaders that they will attend the maharally. The Nishad party, in its poll campaign for the 2019 Lok Sabha election and even after becoming the ally of BJP, has been demanding reservation under SC category for Nishads in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/nishad-party-yatra-to-end-at-lucknow-maharally-on-nov-21/articleshow/87594323.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

However, only work of laying a new layer of hotmix is pending, due to which the stretch has not yet been opened for traffic. The road is likely to be opened for traffic within two to three days, officials said. “Work of repair on the collapsed portion has been completed. While the traffic has been shut on the road, we want to hotmix it, as this is a busy stretch and there is otherwise no opportunity for this work to be carried out. The road can be expected to be opened to traffic in two to three days,” said a PWD official. On November 3, the side portion of the Portuguese-era Ribandar causeway was noticed to have collapsed. The causeway portion has been shut for traffic since and vehicles are being diverted through another route as a precaution for the safety of commuters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pwd-ribandar-causeway-to-open-over-weekend/articleshow/87593607.cms||---
---||Goa||Rules for plastic waste should be applicable from 2016: State to Centre||Panaji: The state government has raised concerns over the implementation of the draft uniform framework for extended producer responsibility (EPR) under the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, which has been notified by the Centre. The state held that it should be applicable from the year 2016 and not from 2021, even as it estimated a Rs 21-crore loss to the exchequer if implementation began from 2021. The framework, it said, should be linked to the goods and services tax regime and should be implemented through any state government department or a special purpose vehicle (SPV) constituted by it, and not by a private agency. It also urged the development of a national software enabling all states to access data. In March 2016, the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) had notified the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, which mandated that generators of waste take steps to minimise generation of plastic waste, to not litter, to ensure segregated storage of waste at source, and to handover segregated waste to local bodies or agencies authorised by them. The rules also mandated the responsibilities of local bodies, gram panchayats, waste generators, retailers and street vendors to manage plastic waste. Several new provisions, including EPR, were introduced. However, no clear guidelines or policy was issued. In a letter to the MoEFCC, state environment minister Nilesh Cabral said Goa had endeavoured to segregate dry and wet waste since 2013 and had succeeded in disposing of garbage to cement plants. It had also set up the Goa Waste Management Corporation, an SPV, for the purpose in 2016. “The government of Goa is incurring Rs 6,794 per tonne as cost for collection, processing, treatment, transportation and final disposal. It is important that this minimum cost be returned to the state through the EPR mechanism instead of the same going to third party agencies involved in the business of EPR,” Cabral said. He also said that the state had collected a meagre amount from the EPR and has been bearing all the expenses for collection, transportation and disposal of plastic waste which should have otherwise been generated from the EPR. “Also, it is extremely important for the Central Pollution Control Board to share details of producers, importers and brand owners, and their sale (including GST, tax invoices etc.) registered with it to the specific states which will enable that particular state to quantify EPR targets,” he said in the letter. “The amount received by the state under EPR could be shared on a proportional basis with the local bodies.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rules-for-plastic-waste-should-be-applicable-from-2016-state-to-centre/articleshow/87593611.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Won’t rest on fuel cess issue: CM||Hyderabad: A day after asserting that they will force the Centre to mend its ways, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said he would not rest till BJP government at the Centre withdraws the cess on petrol and diesel. Allaying fears of farmers, he said the state government will procure paddy in the coming Yasangi season. Addressing a press conference on Monday, the CM said the TRS will go after the BJP government till it withdraws the cess on petroleum products. He said the TRS government did not increase VAT on petrol and diesel and had rationalised the prices in 2015. Upping the ante against the BJP, KCR said the TRS did not come to power like BJP in some states through backdoor methods. “The BJP leaders only know to either instigate people or divide people on communal lines. They play on sentiments of the people and create unrest in the youth to gain votes,” the TRS president said. Refusing to buy the theory that the BJP’s popularity was soaring in Telangana, he said the BJP did not even secure deposit in 107 of 119 assembly seats in the state and their representation in local bodies was almost nil. He reiterated his appeal to the farming community not to cultivate paddy in the coming agriculture season and not to fall into the trap of BJP leaders. “Farmers can go for paddy if they have a tie-up with either seed companies or rice millers. They can opt for paddy if they want to take the risk of getting a good price for their produce,” he said. The CM said: “Going by the current market trends, cotton is the right choice and farmers get a good price for that.” On Telangana BJP state president Bandi Sanjay Kumar’s comments against the TRS government, he said instead of clarifying whether the Centre was willing to procure paddy in the coming agriculture season, he was talking about other subjects. On BJP leaders’ comments on what he had done for Telangana, KCR said it was a big joke. The TRS government was implementing schemes like Mission Bhagiratha, Shaadi Mubarak and Rs 2,000 pension for elderly and others. “Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and other central leaders have praised the Telangana government. Telangana is the top contributor of taxes in the country. Is any BJP-ruled state giving Rs 2,000 pension,” the CM wondered.  He said the BJP leaders criticised him when he said Rayalaseema should get water. “What is wrong in it. The Krishna water issue and sharing was not resolved as the Centre was sitting on the appeal of the state government to refer the issue to a tribunal for the past seven years,” the CM said. He reiterated that the government would implement Dalit Bandhu scheme in Huzurabad and other four mandals apart from 100 beneficiaries from other constituencies before March 2022. “In the next financial year, Rs 20,000 crore would be earmarked for Dalit Bandhu scheme,” KCR said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/wont-rest-on-fuel-cess-issue-cm/articleshow/87593615.cms||Koride Mahesh

State cabinet minister Satish Mahana told TOI on Sunday, “Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will flag off the Metro train for trials on November 10.” “After completing all technical formalities and getting due clearances, we plan to start Metro services for the people on December 31,” said Metro officials. Mahana inspected the Metro depot and Metro station at IIT on Sunday and later held meeting with the Uttar Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation (UPMRC) officials. UPMRC MD Kumar Keshav was also present in the meeting. The flagging off event would be held at the Kanpur Metro depot at Government Polytechnic. Sources said CM Yogi Adityanath will first have a glance at Kanpur Metro train before flagging it off. The trials would be carried out under strict supervision of Research Design and Standards Organisation (RDSO). Sources said, as per protocol, the trials would be carried out for six weeks before Metro is launched for commercial run. Two sets of Metro trains are already parked at the depot one of them would be used for trial. Each train has three coaches. As per plans, on becoming fully operational, six Metro trains will run on the priority corridor between IIT and Motijheel and two trains will remained parked in the depot as reserve. Six more trains will arrive in the city by the time the commercial operations are launched. Mahana said he has been informed by Metro officials that the first phase of work almost concluded on Sunday. On November 15, 2019, CM Yogi Adityanath had kickstarted the Metro work by initiating pile testing. In the first phase, Metro will run on the nine kilometre priority corridor. Nine Metro stations have been constructed so far. The second phase of Metro work would be carried out between Motijheel and Transport Nagar for which underground stations will be constructed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/cm-yogi-to-flag-off-kanpur-metro-trial-run-on-nov-10/articleshow/87588618.cms||Abhinav Malhotra
---||Lucknow||CM Yogi Adityanath intensifies political spadework in west UP region with back-to-back visits||LUCKNOW: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s visits to Kairana in Shamli and Rampur on Monday marked BJP’s stratagy of putting its saffron mascot on the front for escalating the political spadework in the restive west UP region ahead of the assembly elections. The visits are crucial as Kairana was at the centre stage during 2014 Lok Sabha elections after BJP had ratcheted up the issue of Hindu exodus following the 2013 Muzaffarnagar communal riots, while Rampur is the bastion of SP MP Azam Khan. Informed party sources said Yogi is likely to visit Mathura, Meerut, and Saharanpur in quick succession in the next few days. In Mathura, on November 10, Yogi will inaugurate the ‘Braj Raj Utsav’ being organised by Braj Teerth Vikas Board. On November 11, the CM will felicitate paralympics sports persons from across the state in Meerut. Plans are also afoot for CM’s visit to Saharanpur where he will lay the foundation stone of Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) centre in Deoband. The state government had in August green flagged the project, which entails setting up of a commando centre over 2,000 sq mt. The move had come under sharp criticism as the opposition termed it a ‘polarisation bid’ of the BJP government. UP BJP organisation secretary and in charge of Saharanpur, Chandra Mohan said development of west UP has been high on CM Yogi’s agenda. “His visits to the region will speed up the ongoing development projects being carried out by the state government,” he said. Yogi’s move to step up campaign in west UP also gains pertinence in the backdrop of farmers’ continuing protest against the new farm laws. The Lakhimpur violence in which eight persons, including four protesting farmers, were killed had further stoked political frenzy in the region having sizeable presence of Dalits and Muslims. The development also draws a noticeable contrast from the politically crucial east UP region that has been hogging the spotlight amid opposition’s concerted attempts for gaining a foothold in PM Narendra Modi’s constituency Varanasi and CM Yogi’s political backyard Gorakhpur. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav is planning to set the political temperature soaring by kicking off the third phase of his ‘Vijay Yatra’ from Gorakhpur on November 13. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has already visited Varanasi and Gorakhpur and addressed rallies. BJP too is digging in its heels in east UP where Union home minister Amit Shah will lay the foundation stone of a university in Azamgarh, the parliamentary constituency of Akhilesh, on November 13. The inauguration of the 341km Purvanchal Expressway connecting Lucknow with Ghazipur by PM Narendra Modi at Sultanpur on November 16 would further reinforce BJP’s development narrative ahead of polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-yogi-intensifies-political-spadework-in-west-up-region-with-back-to-back-visits/articleshow/87594326.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Hyderabad||Taking leaf from TRS, BJP may seek more bypolls||Hyderabad: The by-poll to Huzurabad Assembly constituency may not be the last one to have been held in the state before the Telangana State Legislative Assembly goes to polls as per schedule in 2023. More bitter electoral battles between political parties, mainly TRS and BJP, may be in the offing. With the victory of BJP in Huzurabad, and the huge political mileage derived by it, the saffron will try to invite more by-polls against chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao-led TRS ahead of 2023, feel political analysts. Though BJP state chief spokesperson K Krishna Saagar said the saffron party does not believe in inviting elected representatives from other parties unless they resign on their own and join their ranks with total belief in its ideology, political observers said there is every possibility that the BJP may try to poach disgruntled TRS legislators. The BJP will also get more mileage if it can force and win a by-poll in the TRS sitting seats than a Congress constituency. Political analyst K Nageshwar said the BJP is likely to try and force by-elections on KCR-led TRS because this was a time-tested strategy of KCR during Telangana agitation. “The TRS legislators used to resign, posing a challenge to the Congress. KCR could successfully undermine the Congress by repeatedly going for by-polls then. So, the BJP may also try to follow the same path. KCR’s own strategy will be used as a weapon against him by the BJP in future,” Nageshwar said. Given the fact that only two years are left for 2023 Assembly polls, or even less than it if KCR opts to go for early polls, political observers said defection of TRS MLAs or even a MP to the BJP will depend on three main factors including whether the sitting MLA is getting feelers or has sensed that he or she may not get party ticket in 2023, if they are convinced that they cannot win on TRS plank and if they have strong perception BJP will come to power in the next polls. On the flip side, BJP can also suffer damage if it loses a by-poll forced by it against the ruling TRS. For example, the talk in political circles is that a by-poll to Munugode Assembly constituency in Nalgonda district cannot be ruled out next year. MLA Komatireddy Rajgopal Reddy, who had won the seat on Congress ticket in 2018, has been issuing statements in favour of BJP. Rajagopal said he would not reveal his strategy but asserted that his ultimate goal is to defeat TRS. Political observers said Munugode is a Congress sitting seat. In case of Rajagopal defecting to BJP, and losing it, it will be BJP which will suffer more damage than the candidate. In the event of winning it, it will help BJP sell a narrative that the Congress is no longer a challenge to TRS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/taking-leaf-from-trs-bjp-may-seek-more-bypolls/articleshow/87593664.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Civil surgeon, 3 others suspended over Ahmednagar hospital blaze||Pune/Nashik: The Maharashtra government on Monday suspended Ahmednagar civil surgeon Dr Sunil Pokharna and three others while terminating the services of two nurses in connection with the Ahmednagar civil hospital ICU fire which killed 11 Covid patients. Meanwhile, health minister Rajesh Tope told TOI on Monday that the fire audit of 525 hospitals under the public health department had been completed, but its recommendations could not be implemented due to delay in funds and technical clearances from the finance and public work departments, respectively. Tope tweeted on Monday night that Pokharna, two medical officers — Dr Suresh Dakhe and Dr Vishaka Shinde — and staff nurse Sapna Pathare stood suspended. The services of two staff nurses, Asma Sheikh and Chhana Anant, have been terminated. “We have taken action against the six based on the initial information that we got following the fire,” Tope tweeted. Seventeen Covid patients were in the ICU when the fire broke out on Saturday morning. While 11 died in the blaze, six sustained burns. Earlier on Monday, Ahmednagar guardian minister Hasan Mushrif said the district planning committee (DPC) had passed a resolution for taking “appropriate action” against Pokharna for the blaze. Speaking to reporters after the DPC meeting, he said a team investigating the blaze, headed by Nashik divisional commissioner Radhakrishna Game, will submit its findings within a week. He said the probe team has been given CCTV footage of the ICU. As many as 567 hospitals in Maharashtra are under the state public health department. In a written reply to a question raised by a BJP MLA in the legislative assembly in March, the minister had committed to completing and executing a fire audit of government hospitals. Tope said, “Collectors have now been told to sanction Rs5-7 crore through their respective district planning funds. The public works department (PWD) has been directed to clear technical clearances for the implementation of the audit.” All sanctions should be in place for all districts by the end of the month, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharashtra-civil-surgeon-3-others-suspended-over-ahmednagar-hospital-blaze/articleshow/87593652.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Huzurabad not just a blip, BJP growing in strength in Telangana||HYDERABAD: The Huzurabad by-poll outcome cannot be dismissed, but at the same time it cannot be termed as the barometer for the 2023 assembly elections. Looking at the performance of BJP after its debacle in the 2018 polls — where it lost deposit in over 100 assembly constituencies — the saffron party has been gaining traction among people not only in urban areas but also the hinterland in Telangana. With only an MLA in its kitty from the 2018 assembly polls, BJP shocked everyone by winning four Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 general elections. Except Secunderabad, other three seats — Nizamabad, Karimnagar and Adilabad — have predominantly rural voters. Then came the shocker for the TRS, whose juggernaut was stopped in the Dubbak by-poll by BJP. Though the margin of victory was less than 1,500 votes, the saffron party polled votes in rural areas. This was the first defeat for TRS in a by-poll after Telangana was formed in 2014. The saffron party’s victory made BJP emerge as a challenger to Congress for the main opposition status in Telangana politics. Riding on the success of Dubbak bypoll, the saffron party came up with an impressive performance in GHMC polls making inroads into TRS wards and divisions in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, where in Congress was relegated to a poor fourth position. But before BJP could establish itself as a clear alternative to the ruling TRS, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao pulled one back by defeating BJP in its seat, the Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahbubnagar Graduate MLC seat. In an astute political move, KCR fielded S Vani Devi, daughter of former PM P V Narasimha Rao, from this seat, and she trounced the saffron party nominee. BJP fared much worse in Nalgonda-Khammam-Warangal Graduate MLC seat, where it was pushed to fourth place. Speaking to TOI, political analyst Prof K Nageshwar said BJP lost its deposit in Nagarjunasagar by-poll but came back to win Huzurabad by-election. BJP could strike TRS in the by-poll, but can it inflict a fatal injury in 2023-polls? Well, it is too early to predict, say political analysts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/huzurabad-not-just-a-blip-bjp-growing-in-strength-in-t/articleshow/87593674.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Kanpur||Alliance with SP only if we get enough seats: Shivpal||Kanpur: Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party Lohia (PSPL) national president Shivpal Singh Yadav said on Sunday that he will have an electoral alliance with Samajwadi Party only if a respectable number of seats are allotted to his party. Reacting to a question on whether Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav’s statement on Muhammad Ali Jinnah was naive and has given ammunition to the BJP, Shivpal said the former will learn gradually. Shivpal, who arrived here as his Samajik Parivartan Rath Yatra reached Kanpur on Sunday, said, “Alliance with Samajwadi Party will be done if we get a respectable share of seats. Besides, due respect must be given to him as well as the old leaders associated with the party.” “A meeting in this regard will be held soon in Lucknow, and only then will seat sharing and alliance be decided,” he said further. He further claimed that PSPL will play a crucial role in government formation ater 2022 state elections and will be part of the ruling dispensation. “We have to bring change and throw out this government and hence we are taking out a parivartan rally. I have covered half of Uttar Pradesh since October 12 and will reach Ayodhya on November 30 where I will have ‘darshan’ of Lord Ram and offer prayers,” he added. “The public is upset because of the wrong policies of the government and that is why a change of power is necessary,” he said. Targeting BJP, Shivpal said, “The country has reached the verge of starvation due to the wrong policies and decisions of this government. The Central government has been paying attention only to capitalists.” Akhilesh had made it clear recently during Diwali that he will have an alliance with uncle Shivpal’s party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/alliance-with-sp-only-if-we-get-enough-seats-shivpal/articleshow/87588692.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Bonanza for slumdwellers, can sell SRA homes in 5 years: Maharashtra housing dept||MUMBAI: With BMC elections round the corner, political parties are wooing slum residents for votes. The state housing department has decided to allow beneficiaries of Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) projects to sell tenements allotted to them within five years of their shanties being razed. In addition, residents of slums that have come up between 2000 and 2011 will be able to get permanent homes under SRA schemes by paying Rs 2.5 lakh. Times ViewThe latest move is a populist one by the state government ahead of the BMC polls and seeks to reward encroachers squatting on public land. The free housing scheme for slumdwellers, which took off 25 years ago, has failed to curb encroachments in the city. By allowing families to sell their free tenements without a substantial waiting period, the state is defeating the purpose of the scheme. In the past, housing experts pointed out how many slum families sold their brand new tenements and moved into another slum. Also, pushing the cutoff date from 2000 to 2011 will lead to construction of more slums.This means, most beneficiaries will be able to sell their tenements, with SRA permission, as soon as construction is completed, said officials. SRA buildings take an average 36-52 months for completion, depending on the size of the scheme and the number of tenements. The housing department’s recommendations now await the state cabinet nod. At present, slumdwellers get houses free of cost under the SRA scheme, but they can’t sell or rent them out for 10 years. If sold before the lock-in period, the state government is entitled to an amount equivalent to stamp duty or Rs 1 lakh, whichever is higher. Calling the state housing department’s decision a “Diwali gift from the Maha Vikas Aghadi”, the department’s minister Jitendra Awhad said: “Slumdwellers will no longer have to wait for 10 years to sell their tenements. They can sell their tenements five years after the slum is demolished. Home buyers and sellers will, however, need SRA permission.” Officials said that under the eligibility-on-payment scheme, those living in slums constructed between 2000 and 2011 will get 300 sq ft permanent houses for Rs 2.5 lakh. “There was a law that gave them eligibility, but the rate was not fixed. Now we have done that. With this 80% of slums will be covered in Mumbai,” Awhad said. Political observers said this is another populist decision ahead of the BMC polls. “It seems Shiv Sena and NCP have had an understanding. Most decisions being taken by the housing department, run by NCP’s Awhad, will help the Sena which has a big stake in BMC polls,” said an observer. The recommendations were made by a panel led by Awhad and comprising ministers Aaditya Thackeray, Varsha Gaikwad, Anil Parab, Nawab Malik and Aslam Shaikh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bonanza-for-slumdwellers-can-sell-sra-homes-in-5-years-state/articleshow/87593671.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Mumbai||3 lives lost in two blazes in Mumbai due to a simple physics problem||MUMBAI: Low water pressure in firefighting riser systems hampered operations in both recent high-rise blazes – at Kandivli’s Hansa Heritage and Lower Parel’s One Avighna Park – in which three lives were lost. During the Hansa Heritage blaze on Saturday night, the riser was started but a water jet just did not come out on time, making the fire spread. The same thing had occurred in the One Avighna blaze. Fire brigade officials say that it is important for housing societies to regularly check their inhouse firefighting systems so that they work when they are needed the most. They say it is crucial to ensure that required water pressure in building firefighting systems is maintained at all times. In their reply to the fire brigade’s notice for Saturday’s blaze, society members of the 15-storey Hansa Heritage have said that as per their knowledge, the fire system in the building was in working condition and that the secretary and security guard used the extinguisher and water hose line on the 13th and 14th floors to fight the flames. “But we will do the needful as requested to recheck and start the system within 15 days as asked,” stated the letter. But fire brigade officials said that water from the hose is required to come “gushing out” once operations are started for effective operations. “If water does not come out with the required force, it won’t be possible to douse flames, which will then spread. Thus, despite the presence of a firefighting system, there will be unnecessary loss of life and property,” said a senior fire official. Local corporator Leena Patel Deherkar said society members informed her that a mock drill was conducted in May or June and the firefighting system was found operational. She reiterated that the system was started on Saturday, but water did not come out with the required pressure. In the case of the October 22 blaze at the 60-storey One Avighna Park, fire officials said low water pressure initially hampered operations, but the system ultimately did work as intended. “Crucial time could have been saved had the system started immediately,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-lives-lost-in-two-blazes-due-to-a-simple-physics-problem/articleshow/87593684.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Aurangabad||Passport applications pile up as police fail to pay software fee||Aurangabad: Hundreds of passport verification applications are pending across 17 police stations of Aurangabad city as the city police authorities have failed to pay the user fee of the licensed software-cum-application that the state police uses for verifying criminal antecedents including pending undertrial cases of each of the applicant. The private service provider on its website claims to have access to over 180 million records across 19,000 courts and benches in India. Despite having access to Crime and Criminal Tracking Networking Systems (CCTNS), a pan-India project comprising comprehensive data of criminals as well as live recording of FIRs and day-to-day police related records, the special branch’s passport verification policemen deployed at every police station rely on this application for being sure about the applicant’s credentials. As per procedure, after a person makes an online application for passport, he/she is given an appointment at passport office where all the original documents and identity proofs are submitted while filling the online form. This is followed by the file of applicant being sent to the area police station for verifying his criminal antecedents, if any and depending on the finding, a report is sent back to passport authority that finally issues the passport to an individual. Masood Qadri, an IT professional, told TOI, “Police verification of my passport is pending for over a fortnight. The policemen do not know what to do when the application has stopped working due to non-payment of fees.” Those working with the passport branch said in case of emergency, policemen have been asked to use CCTNS and another open source software, till the issue gets resolved. Authorities said the said software is also used by private companies and financial institutions for checking employee’s criminal record, customer verification under different acts, loan processing and risk profiling. A senior police officer said, “The application was free and open for all, but they made it chargeable over a year ago. For Aurangabad city, the annual fees is Rs 90,000 and the proposal for making the payment is pending with the officer concerned.” When contacted about the issue, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Aparna Gite said, “I am occupied with the ongoing police driver recruitment. I will talk on this later.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/passport-applications-pile-up-as-police-fail-to-pay-software-fee/articleshow/87593676.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Indian Air Force station Chakeri and its adjoining civilian pockets remain the Zika epicentre with all contracting the disease within 400m off the house of the first patient, a IAF warrant officer who tested positive on October 23. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath expressed concern over rising Zika cases with his office tweeting that the infection is spreading rapidly in Kanpur and directed rapid testing and ramping up of hospital infrastructure. The district health department has intensified scanning and sample collection from Zika suspects in the Chakeri hinterland. On Saturday, 13 patients had tested positive for the disease. While confirming 10 more cases on Sunday, chief medical officer Dr Nepal Singh said, contact tracing teams were preparing reports on patients. “No patient is critical, but we are monitoring minor and pregnant patients round the clock,” he said. District Magistrate Visakh G Iyer said, health department officials have been ordered to conduct door-to-door sample collection for surveillance and virus testing. Also, the command and control centre of Kanpur Municipal Corporation was converted into Zika control room, he said. Expressing concern, chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s office stated special caution was needed to curb Zika spread. “Testing should be intensified and hospitals should be geared up to treat patients. Health officials should ensure full cooperation of monitoring committees,” he stated. While reviewing the health infrastructure in hospitals, the district magistrate said, Zika patients would be called twice a day to ascertain their condition. Government hospitals have been put on high alert and the infectious disease control campaign has been intensified. Chief medical superintendent, Ursala Hospital, Dr Anil Nigam, said, “Our team is regularly inspecting affected areas and civic teams have been deployed for fogging to decimate mosquito breeding points.” The health department also urged caution in view of rising cases. “Massive arrangements are in place across all government hospitals. Surveillance teams are zeroing in on infected patients,” a top health official said. The first Zika case was reported from Pardewanpurwa in Chakeri on October 23 after a 57-year-old Indian Air Force officer tested positive for the virus. Later, he was admitted to Air Force hospital, where the doctors stated his condition was stable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/kanpur-zika-tally-89-cm-for-surveillance-rapid-sample-testing/articleshow/87588715.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

The boy’s throat was slit. His father has accused a neighbour of killing his son. Police are also looking at the ‘black magic’ angle in the case. According to the police, the boy was last seen playing with his toys in the front passage of his house. Unable to find him, his father, Veer Singh, filed a missing complaint with the police. The family later found their son’s body dumped barely 150 meters from their house. His clothes were soaked in blood and the throat was slit, said police. Talking with TOI, a policeman said, “We are also looking at the angle of black magic in this case as prima facie, the murder appears to be part of some black magic activity.” Subhash Singh, SHO of Mundawali police station, confirmed that the boy’s uncle is a tantric and the possibility of black magic is not being ruled out. “We are trying to get CCTV footage of nearby areas.

---||Ahmedabad||Most markets to reopen on Labh Pancham||Ahmedabad: The Indian holiday season finally came to an end, at least for the business community of Ahmedabad. Come Labh Pancham, and the bustle of Ahmedabad will be back yet again, as shops, commercial establishments and markets across the city will resume business as usual from Tuesday. Being an auspicious day, the day does hold prominence for a lot of businessmen even today, who check for an auspicious muhurat (choghadiya) of the day and personally go to their stores to open the shop, perform the pooja and then start their day. “After performing the chopda poojan on Diwali, most shops resume business straight on Labh Pancham. The chopda or the book of account is worshipped during the pooja on Diwali night. People cover it with a muslin cloth and worship it again on Labh Pancham day, write the first account of the year – which typically comprises an order from a regular customer, prepares the bill, dispatches the commodity and then closes the new book. This tradition is followed over generations since the mahajans i.e. trade communities of Ahmedabad were formed,” recalls Jayendra Tanna, president of the Gujarat Traders’ Federation. Major markets across the city will open. These include shops and establishments along SG Highway, Shivranjini Crossroads, CG Road, Teen Darwaza, Panchkuwa Cloth Market, Madhupura spice market, among others. “Only the jewellery markets in Manek Chowk and Ratan Pol will resume on Saatam muhurat instead of Labh Pancham. It is customary for most jewellers in those markets to resume business on Saatam, which falls on Thursday this week,” said Ashish Zaveri, a city-based jeweller. Some businessmen personally visit their shops early in the day, perform the Labh Paancham pooja, burst crackers as part of the occasion and then get down to business. “Our first order is usually pre-decided, prepared and kept ready and we dispatch the consignment on the day of Labh Pancham, on an auspicious note,” said a cloth trader in the New Cloth Market. Traders, however, feel that the market will go through a lull-period in terms of demand over the next few weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/most-markets-to-reopen-on-labh-pancham/articleshow/87593703.cms||---
---||Dehradun||SC panel: Constructions for upcoming tiger safari envisioned by Modi not undertaken in eco-friendly manner; 4 forest rest house campuses saw additional building construction works without approvals||Dehradun: An inspection of the Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) by a Supreme Court-appointed central empowered committee (CEC) has revealed that forest authorities carried out construction activities at the upcoming Pakhro Tiger Safari (PTR) — envisioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi — with concrete, instead of eco-friendly material like bamboo, in violation of the sanctions given by the National Tiger Conservation Authority, Central Zoo Authority and the Forest Conservation Division of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF&CC). These bodies, according to CEC, had given swift approvals to the project with the condition that all constructions will be undertaken in an eco-friendly manner without causing any damage or threat to the rich biodiversity and ecosystem of Corbett that has the world’s highest tiger density. A report drafted by the panel reads, “It was pointed out that as per the condition of the approval granted by GoI, the infrastructure of the tiger safari was to be created mainly from bamboo and other natural material but the structures were all built with Reinforced Cement Concrete (RCC).” In response, the forest authorities stated, “The area is frequented by elephants and is termite- prone. Thus, the main structure has been erected on beams and columns. Bamboo will be used in later stages to make the structure eco-friendly.” Countering the response, TC Nautiyal, DIG (forests) of the regional office of the MoEF&CC at Dehradun, who was also a part of the team in the capacity of an inspecting officer, mentioned in the report, “It was suggested that the director of Corbett Tiger Reserve appropriately designs the structures as per the conditions of forest committee approval granted by MoEF&CC.” The CEC team had visited the site in October after Supreme Court advocate Gaurav Kumar Bansal filed a petition (on September 20) alleging illegal construction works and tree felling at the Kalagarh Tiger Reserve division of Corbett. During the inspection, the team had covered Pakhro Tiger Safari, Pakhro Forest Rest House Campus, Morghatti Forest Rest House Campus, Kugadda Forest Camp and the Saneh Forest Rest House in the Lansdowne forest division, situated close to CTR. The team also noted that more than 163 trees — the approved count — were felled for these constructions at Pakhro safari park. However, the team was not able to ascertain the exact number of trees that were felled. “The state government should carry out a thorough investigation and submit a detailed report for the consideration of the Regional Empowered Committee (REC) which will take appropriate action as per law for the violation of condition the Forest Committee approval,” added the report, a copy of which is with TOI. Attempts were made by TOI to reach out to Kishen Chandra, the divisional forest officer (DFO) of Kalagarh Tiger Reserve division, under whose jurisdiction the alleged violations were observed, but he was unavailable. When asked about the issue, JS Suhag, chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand forest department, under whose jurisdiction all protected areas (PAs) in the state fall, said, “I have not received any written complaints regarding construction works so far from anyone. The CTR administration works as per the management plan. Neither any permission is sought nor given. Also, structures in Morghatti have been demolished.” The panel also pointed out that across four rest houses near the proposed Pakhro Tiger Safari — three in Kalagarh Tiger Reserve Division and one in Lansdowne forest division buildings were being built without any approvals of all the stakeholders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/sc-panel-constructions-for-upcoming-tiger-safari-envisioned-by-modi-not-undertaken-in-eco-friendly-manner-4-forest-rest-house-campuses-saw-additional-building-construction-works-without-approvals/articleshow/87592909.cms||Shivani Azad

State agriculture minister Dada Bhuse on Monday inaugurated the plant which has over 40 sugar cane farmers connected with it. It has invested around Rs 4 crore to set up the small jaggery plant with a capacity to crush 25 tonne of sugar a day. The funds have been raised through a bank. Bhuse said that the jaggery project has come up through group farming and the objective is to take the produce of the farmers directly to the consumers. “Young farmers will definitely become industrialists through a group farming and farmers producer companies,” he said. Bhuse said the state government is implementing various schemes for the empowerment of farmers. “Farmers are encouraged to grow the produce that has much demand in the market. There are schemes to help farmers reach their produce directly to consumers,” he added. The minister added that the government has also taken initiative to impart training related to grading and packaging of the produce to the farmers. Around 300 officials have been entrusted with the responsibilities of imparting such training. Sanjay Tungar, director of the Nashik Honeybee farmers producer company said that they will be making organic jaggery at the plant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/farmers-producer-company-sets-up-jaggery-plant-in-nashik/articleshow/87593687.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Mangaluru||For smaller hotels increasing prices could be a challenge||Mangaluru: While eating out in most cities is expected to become expensive because of the rise in prices of essential commodities and commercial LPG cylinders, many owners of smaller hotels in the city are in a Catch-22 situation. They indicate that it is not possible to increase prices as of now since business has not yet reached pre-covid levels. Harish Barvathaya, from Hotel Shri Rama Vilas, Kadri said, “We cannot think of passing on the burden on our customers. There is no doubt that input costs have increased, but our customers are mostly daily wagers and people from the middle class. In fact, they have been requesting us to reduce prices. We can probably think of increasing rates, when customer flow increases,” he said. A hotel manager Ramesh B said most small and medium hotels have decided to wait and observe the market before deciding on increasing prices. He said many hotels had increased rates about 18 months ago. “In case the prices of LPG cylinders fall, it may not be easy to reduce prices. Since business is just picking up after the lockdown, many hotels are going slow on the price rise,” he added. Chandrakanth Kamath of Hotel Shivabagh said they have not increased prices for the time being. “Since we operate from our own building, we have been able to manage so far,” he said. Meanwhile, a few hotels have increased prices for a cup of tea from Rs 10 to Rs 13. The cost of two vadas that used to cost Rs 20 is now Rs 30 and the cost of one plate idli has increased from Rs 20 to Rs 30. The price of almost all Dosa items has increased by Rs 5. DK Hotels and Restaurants Association president Kudpi Jagadish Shenoy said some hotels have increased their prices by 10-20% mainly because of the rise in commercial LPG cylinder prices and prices for raw materials. “The business is slowly improving. About 25% of customers are not stepping out of their homes, which could also be due to Covid fear and companies still following work from home,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/for-smaller-hotels-increasing-prices-could-be-a-challenge/articleshow/87592712.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

The 83-year-old had been conferred the award in 2020, but the award ceremony was postponed due to corona pandemic. Shareef, popularly known as Shareef Chacha, was a bicycle mechanic. His eldest son Raees was murdered in 1992 on way to Sultanpur, a neighbouring district of Ayodhya (then Faizabad). With his unclaimed body lying on the road, it was devoured by stray animals. After this incident, Shareef started performing the last rites of the unidentified bodies. He used to visit police stations, hospitals, railway stations and mortuary in search of unclaimed bodies. The bodies are handed over to him by police only after nobody claims it for 72 hours. For his selfless service, he was conferred with India's fourth highest civilian award Padma Shri in 2020. Shareef’s son Shabbeer told TOI: “We received a call from the ministry of home a day back. They called us to Delhi and arranged air tickets for three persons. In Delhi, we stayed at Ashoka Hotel and on Monday evening my father was conferred Padma Shri by President Ramnath Kovind.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/samaritan-of-last-rites-shareef-gets-padma-shri-award/articleshow/87594375.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

The crocodile was basking in the sun in the nullah behind Patrakar Colony near Bole Petrol Pump when people recorded videos and clicked photos.Kundan Hate, honorary wildlife warden, said, “This is the third time we have received a call about this, and the crocodile has been spotted in the same area. The nullah has a lot of water and the crocodile is getting ample food it seems. It looks to be around 5 years old.”Forest officials have deployed a team to track and capture the crocodile, but it’s not going to be so easy. Hate said, “We are going there again on Tuesday and will have to tread carefully. If it is inside water, then catching the crocodile will be very difficult because that’s her domain. Like tiger in a jungle, crocodile rules the water. We have even informed NMC to not allow any staff to go for cleaning work in that particular patch.” But where did this crocodile come from? Hate says it’s speculation at best, but Lower Pench could be the origin. “There are crocodiles in Pench river from where it might have entered Lower Pench. From there it may have come through the water pipelines to Gorewada and then through waste discharge to the nullah. If it keeps moving, then the crocodile will end up in Nag river near Pardi,” said Hate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/crocodile-spotted-in-nullah-forest-dept-team-on-its-trail/articleshow/87592929.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Covid booster dose on advisory panel radar||KOLKATA: In sync with the growing demand for booster doses, Bengal’s Global Advisory (GAB) for Covid-19 response has discussed its necessity in a recently held weekly meeting and has strongly recommended the additional dose. It wants the state government to have its plan ready so that it can start administering the booster dose as and when it is introduced by the Union health ministry. “The vaccine-induced immunity will start waning in eight to nine months after being fully vaccinated. So, those who took the vaccine right at the beginning of the drive, including healthcare workers and frontliners, would need the booster dose from January 2022 onwards,” senior physician Sukumar Mukherjee told TOI. GAB member Mukherjee said the issue of booster dose was discussed threadbare during the board’s meeting last Thursday. Even as the decision to introduce the dose has to come from the Centre and the protocol has to be set by ICMR, keeping itself ready in advance would make the implementation easier, felt the board members. TOI on Saturday reported an increasing demand for booster doses from a cross-section of healthcare workers. “We cannot make our own move to introduce the booster dose. While we wait for specific directives from the Union health ministry, we will be keeping our infrastructure ready for the third dose rollout so that we can implement it immediately,” said a senior health official. IPGMER hepatology head Abhijit Chowdhury, who is also on GAB board, said while a booster dose will be required, we need to keep in mind the financial and logistic issues given the fact that a large number of eligible population in the country is yet to get even a single dose. “There’s no doubt that immunity will start waning for those who took their jabs in the beginning of the drive and hence the need for booster dose. But as a health activist, I strongly feel the need to consider factors like fiscal implications and vaccine equity when we talk about the booster dose,” said Chowdhury. Many health experts said that at least 50% of the eligible Indian population should get fully vaccinated before the third booster is rolled out. In West Bengal, around 80% of the eligible population have got the first dose while 31% have got fully vaccinated. Health officials plan to get at least around 60% of the population to get both doses by December end. “Our priority now will be to scale up the second dose as fast as possible so that we have a respectable percentage of the eligible population fully vaccinated in the shortest possible time,” said a health official involved in the inoculation planning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-booster-dose-on-advisory-panel-radar/articleshow/87592927.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Tilakchandra Thapa, 31, a resident of Noblenagar, said in his FIR with Satellite police that he along with his staff members had gathered outside Karnavati food court near the Iskcon crossroads. When they were bursting crackers there, two unknown men approached them and told them not to burn the firecrackers on the road. Thapa and his colleagues went to the other side and started burning the crackers again. After a while, the two men along with two others came there again and began abusing Thapa and his staffers for burning crackers. Thapa and his staffers objected to the abuse, after which the four men brought sticks and attacked Thapa and his two staffers.

---||Hyderabad||Fire station demand in Secunderabad Cantonment hanging fire for long||SECUNDERABAD: For over a decade, the demand for a dedicated fire station in Secunderabad Cantonment limits on the lines of neighbouring GHMC has been hanging fire. Residents have been sounding out the alarm as SCB houses several commercial units, but depends solely on fire stations in GHMC areas. “SCB areas have nearly 10,000 business units and also small-scale industries in Rasoolpura. Though we do not have high-rises like in GHMC, in case of any fire, we have to depend on TS fire service department,” said B Subhash from Bowenpally. Recollecting a fire in the accounts wing of SCB main office in 2017, a retired BHEL employee said, “It gutted records and furniture. They had to depend on the fire station in Secunderabad. Not having a fire station in SCB limits is unacceptable.” According to Telangana State Disaster Response & Fire Services Department’s records, there are 17 fire stations in twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad but none between SCB and Shamirpet (up to Hakimpet). “The SCB-Shamirpet stretch is a very busy one with hundreds of vehicles moving at any given time. A fire could be disastrous here as there is no fire station nearby,” K Madhusudhana Rao, district fire officer, Secunderabad, told TOI. But if all goes well, the SCB may yet get its own fire station in the not-so-distant future. Secunderabad Cantonment Board officials had agreed to build a fire station after a request from TS fire department but it got mired in delays over land allotment and funds. A few months ago the work finally began at Teachers’ Colony, Rao said, adding that in another six months a fire station would come up in SCB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fire-stn-demand-in-scb-hanging-fire-for-long/articleshow/87593695.cms||Sunil Mungara

The region needs to administer over 1 lakh jabs per day if it has to achieve the state government target of completing first dose for all the eligible population by November 30. At over 45,000 doses administered during the day, Amravati division did well with Buldhana topping the chart at over 14,000 doses. Nagpur division needs to administer 32,000 jabs per day to meet the target while its achievement was an impressive 36,618.The Nagpur division has a stock of 6.89 lakh Covishield and 2.15lakh Covaxin doses which are enough for the next 11 and 13 days, respectively. Nagpur district recorded over 18,000 vaccination, including over 6,000 first dose and 12,000 second dose. On October 30, nearly same number of beneficiaries were jabbed though the percentage of first dose was higher then. The recent orders to restrict entry of unvaccinated too came into force with officials deployed at Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and district collector office to check vax certificates of vistiors.At NMC, the unvaccinated were given the facility of taking the jab on the spot.Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi was satisfied with the performance in the city. “Perhaps, the decisions taken lately have had a positive impact on people. The collector’s order too made a difference. We have been giving jabs to unvaccinated vistiors at the entry poiont at NMC offices for the last two weeks. Vistors are instantly allowed to walk in after taking the jab in case they are unvaccinated,” he said. Joshi said the NMC is expecting more people to take the first dose. “Still, we are happy that even those having their second dose due for sometime now are getting it at the earliest. There were some people whose second dose was overdue. These people had become laxed as the fear of disease has subsided,” he said.District Collector Vimala R said that there wasn’t any resistance from government staff. “I am randomly checking the vaccination status of those coming to my office. One was found unvaccinated and was asked to leave. People still believe that vaccines are not proven. This is unscientific thinking. We have seen how death and infection rate have drastically gone down. Even if people are getting infected, the disease remains mild,” she said.She added that the administration needs to wait for another 10 days to see the actual impact of the fresh measures. “Nagpur has a 80% first dose coverage. Even as people are allowed to freely move around, cases are still under control. We just want people to understand the value of their life,” she said.

Gopale had probed the IPL cricket betting scandal which led to the arrest of Gurunath Meiyappan, son in-law of BCCI president N Srinivasan and owner of Chennai Super Kings in 2013, journalist J Dey murder case, 26/11 terror attack case, and Indian Mujhadeein terror case. Sources said that Gopale and Korke, who were called in to record their statement, at the CID office at Belapur were arrested. While Gopale was currently posted at police training at Khandala, API Korke was attached to the Local Arms division. The extortion complaint pertains to a complaint lodged by builder Shyam Agarwal against police officers including Param Bir Singh, businessman Sanjay Punamia and police officers. Special public prosecutor Shekar Jagtap said that the CID will produce them in the 8th Metropolitan magistrate court on Tuesday. This February, Punamia had lodged a complaint against Agarwal at Juhu police station, stating that gangster Chhota Shakeel had issued him threats on behalf of Agarwal to settle a financial dispute. Singh, who was city top cop then, transferred the case to the crime branch unit 9 headed by Gopale and on Singh’s order, the crime branch invoked the stringent MCOCA against Agarwal, though no one was arrested. Agarwal alleged that on March 5, API Korke carried a search at his Vile Parle office, confiscated some property documents which were never brought on record, and made an illegal panchnama. Agarwal claimed that Gopale, Korke and DCP Akbar Pathan extorted Rs 50 lakh from him.Pathan has approached Bombay high court for quashing of FIR. An officer added that due to Param Bir Singh, many officers executed several illegal orders and became accused in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/param-bir-extortion-case-investigation-2-cops-held/articleshow/87593719.cms||Ahmed Ali

Deputy inspector of survey of Toopran revenue division of Medak district slapped the notices on Jamuna Hatcheries to survey the land in various survey numbers between November 16 and 18. The revenue staff pasted notices at Jamuna Hatcheries and the residence of Eatala Rajender. “The survey was supposed to be conducted in June. However, the firm approached the court to stop the survey and probe. HC however, did not give any order to stop the probe or survey but said it can be done after Covid-19 pandemic is over. Since Covid-19 cases were almost nil in the district, the survey staff decided to continue the inquiry,” Medak collector S Hareesh told TOI. State government had ordered an inquiry on Rajender’s firm, Jamuna Hatcheries, when there were allegations that the firm had encroached upon assigned land in April last week this year. Subsequently, Rajender was removed from the cabinet and he finally quit the party. The Medak collector in May reported to the government that Jamuna Hatcheries, owned by then minister Eatala Rajender, had encroached upon 66 acres of ceiling assigned land in Achampet and Hakimpet villages in Masaipet mandal of Medak district.  Hareesh had sent a report to the government with survey numbers, ceiling assigned land, encroachments noticed and patta land. Of 315 acres in the controversial land parcel, 121 acres was surveyed by using digital technology. Land in survey number 77 (7.19 acres), 78 (8.25 acres), 79 (10.10 acres), 80 (10.10 acres), 81 (9.19 acres) and 82 (3.11 acres) in Achampet and another 15.24 acres in survey number 130 in the same village and 1.02 acres in survey number 97 in Hakimpet village was encroached upon by Jamuna Hatcheries, the collector report stated. Jamuna Hatcheries denied allegations and said company purchased about 60 acres land in Achampet and Hakimpet in Masaipet lawfully and built 12 breeder laying farm sheds in addition to two brooding farm sheds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatalas-hatcheries-get-notices-for-land-survey/articleshow/87593717.cms||Koride Mahesh

However, its duration is yet to be declared. The book fair, organised by Publishers and Booksellers Guild, was cancelled in 2021 because of Covid. The guild had written to the CM before the Puja, requesting her to consider the possibility of holding the fair at the beginning of 2022 and asked for suggestions about precautions to be taken. The chief minister had indicated to the guild officials on Mahalaya that she might allow the fair to be held in January, though she did not indicate any date at that time. The fair will be held at Salt Lake’s Central Park like previous years. Under normal circumstances, the fair is held for 12 days. Guild officials hope the CM would not ask them to cut it short this time. The last book fair, held in 2020, started on January 28 and ended on February 8. A total of 600-odd publishers participated and there were 200 little magazines, too. “We are expecting to be guided by the CM over the number of publishers we can invite this time, the layout of the fair and other precautions we need to take.. She has consulted the state health department and announced the date,” said Tridib Chatterjee, general secretary of the guild. “We expect to hold the Kolkata Literature Festival, too, this time. However, everything will depend on the state advisory,” he said. The guild organised two small book fairs this year — one at Jodhpur Park and the other at Bidhan Shishu Udyan. The first had just 150 publishers and social distancing, along with other Covid protocols. Only 100sqft was allotted to each publisher. “We organised the fair at Jodhour Park to celebrate Bhasha Diwas and called it Ekusher Boimela. It started from February 21 and continued for eight days. Since the city was missing the book fair, we got quite a good response,” said Sudhangshu Dey, president of the Guild. On Monday, a group of publishers belonging to the Bangiya Prakashak O Pustak Bikreta Sabha started a small book fair on their premises on College Street. About 100 publishers are participating. Another group of publishers had held a small fair at Hrishikesh Park in April. The Guild will hold its EC meeting on Tuesday to draw up tentative plans for the fair, which will be submitted to the CM. The Guild will announce the primary plans on Friday. “Even London Book Fair, one of the bigger fairs of the world, got pushed back from March to April. We are happy the CM is allowing us to hold our fair around the usual time,” Chatterjee said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-a-yrs-gap-boimela-to-be-back-on-jan-31/articleshow/87592954.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Nagpur||Two, including minor, booked for tying crackers to canine’s tail||Nagpur: An ugly prank of tying crackers to the tail of a dog proved costly for two teenagers, including a minor, after police took cognizance of the incident following intervention of animal lovers and NGO. The two were rounded up by Koradi police on Monday.The cops requested a veterinarian from Koradi Veterinary hospital at Mahadula to conduct a medical test of the canine after bringing it to the Koradi police station. The veterinarian found no injuries on the canine who stayed in front of the residence of the teenagers.The matter came to fore after a video of the cruelty went viral on social media prompting two dog lovers, Swapnil Bodhane and Ashish Kohole, to approach the Koradi police.Police said offence was registered against one Jeevan Barai and his 14-year-old accomplice under different provisions of the laws related to animal cruelty. As seen in the video, Barai and his friend tied crackers in the tail of the canine probably to play a prank. Police have claimed that the accused had also asked a passer-by to videograph the episode which subsequently went viral.In the video, the docile canine is seen petrified with the unknown object being tied to its tail. As the boys were tying the crackers and liting it up, the canine merely was trying to resist it meekly due to its acquaintance with the tormentors.Activist Bodhane said the canine probably stayed in front of one of the accused’s house and also was fed by the family members. “This action against the accused was required as such instances of cruelty are increasing. Most cases do not come to police stations and in some cases actions are not initiated,” he said.Another animal activist Karishma Galani said national crusader for animal rights Maneka Gandhi has taken a serious note of the incident and is now personally looking into the matter. Senior inspector Krishna Shinde of Koradi police station said the canine was handed over to the father of Barai as their family looked after it. “The dog did not have any injury but strong legal action was initiated,” said the inspector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/two-including-minor-booked-for-tying-crackers-to-canines-tail/articleshow/87592956.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||Londhe files Re1 defamation suit against BJP’s Somaiya||Nagpur: Newly-appointed Congress spokesperson Atul Londhe on Monday filed civil and criminal defamation cases against BJP state unit vice-president Kirit Somaiya. The complainant prayed for imposing Re1 penalty on the respondent and an apology for “levelling false and baseless allegations” against Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) leaders. Speaking to the media outside the District and Sessions Court premises, Londhe said the former BJP MP was making defamatory statements against Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena leaders without any iota of proof and there was an immediate need to stop him. Londhe stated that Somaiya’s relentless attack and false charges against MVA leaders are leading to creation of distrust among the masses. “He is responsible for ending the careers of many young leaders. Till date, he could not prove even a single charge against any of the leaders. If you want to expose corruption, do it without targeting selected parties and with concrete proof,” said Londhe. The spokesperson further said that appearing on a TV channel, Somaiya had alleged that out of the Rs100 crore extortion money received by a former minister as claimed by former Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh, 40% each were received by NCP and Sena and rest 20% were pocketed by Congress. Londhe claimed he was present in the same show. “When I asked Somaiya for proof, he walked away. I have submitted video clippings of that show along with my cases. When Singh himself is saying that he has no proof for his Rs100 crore charge, how can Somaiya make such defamatory allegations?” said Londhe. Speaking on other allegations made by the former BJP MP against his party leaders, Londhe said that in one case, the judge himself said that he waited for seven years in his office for Somaiya to lodge a complaint, but he never came. “He even made charges against state minister Chhagan Bhujbal, but the court absolved the latter of all charges. We want to put a full stop to Somaiya’s activities where he unnecessarily defames public leaders without any evidence,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/londhe-files-re1-defamation-suit-against-bjps-somaiya/articleshow/87593714.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: PM Narendra Modi to launch Purvanchal Expressway on November 16||LUCKNOW: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to inaugurate the 341km-long Purvanchal Expressway, between Lucknow and Ghazipur, on November 16. This is one of the several projects in the state lined up to be inaugurated by the PM, who is expected to set the political temperatures of poll-bound UP soaring by making frequent visits to inaugurate or lay the foundation stone of mega projects in November and December. While PM is likely to lay the foundation of the Noida International Airport, Noida Film City, and the Ganga Expressway between Meerut and Prayagraj, he is all set to inaugurate Kashi Vishwanath Corridor, fertilizer factory and AIIMS in Gorakhpur, the political backyard of CM Yogi Adityanath. According to UP government, the PM is scheduled to dedicate the Purvanchal Expressway from Sultanpur on November 16. Constructed at an estimate cost of Rs 42,000 crore, the expressway is being touted as a catalyst to boost development in socio-economically impoverished east UP. The foundation stone of Purvanchal Expressway was laid by Modi in Azamgarh in July 2018. Likewise, the foundation stone of the 594km-long Ganga Expressway would be laid by PM Modi next month. He will also lay the foundation stone for the construction of Noida Airport and Film City to be built in Gautam Budh Nagar. Modi is also scheduled to visit Jhansi this month. Here, he will attend the 193rd birth anniversary celebrations of Rani Laxmi Bai. Preparations are on for the PM’s rally in Jhansi Fort Complex. The PM will flag off many development projects, including a tap water scheme in Jhansi. Apart from this, the foundation stone of investment projects will be laid in the Jhansi node under the Defence Corridor. The PM will participate in the ‘bhoomi pujan’ ceremony of the factory being set up by Bharat Dynamics Ltd there. The PM is also expected to dedicate the Kashi Vishwanath Temple Corridor in his parliamentary constituency of Varanasi next month. The project, started in March 2019, is proposed to come up at a cost of around Rs 400 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pm-to-launch-purvanchal-expressway-on-nov-16/articleshow/87594382.cms||---
---||Mumbai||On HC order, Maharashtra govt forms panel to hear 28 MSRTC unions||MUMBAI: In a significant order issued by the Bombay high court on Monday, the state government has been directed to set up a committee comprising senior bureaucrats from finance, transport and an MSRTC managing director as coordinator to hear representatives of 28 unions that are staging a protest, demanding “merger of MSRTC with the government”. By late Monday afternoon, the state issued a Government Resolution (GR) notifying the formation of the panel as per court directives. The court order came at a time when 226 bus depots were totally shut on the 12th day of protest by MSRTC drivers and conductors across Maharashtra on Monday, inconveniencing lakhs of commuters. A division bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and S P Tavade has asked the panel to “submit decisions/recommendations to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray — who in turn will consider the recommendations and submit the same to the court with his views/ opinion on the said recommendations.” The entire exercise has to be completed within 12 weeks. The panel will comprise additional chief secretary, finance department; principal secretary, finance department; and additional chief secretary, transport department, while MSRTC managing director will act as a coordinator and assist the committee, the court order mentioned. Transport minister Anil Parab said that by 3 pm, the state promptly notified the formation of panel. Government pleader Priyabhushan Kakade subsequently submitted the GR to the court. The committee will have to inform the court every fortnight about progress made by them, i.e. the status of the hearing given by it to 28 unions as well as MSRTC representatives. A few union leaders, however, said that such committees have been formed in the past too, but in vain. Sources said that strike was likely to continue at some depots on Tuesday. In an incident at Alibaug, MSRTC workers on strike reacted sharply by forcibly putting bangles on the hands of a MSRTC bus driver and garlanded a woman conductor after they were found ferrying passengers from Parel to Alibaug. The agitating employees were annoyed by their co-workers not supporting the strike. A non-cognizable offence under section 186 of the IPC for voluntarily obstructing any public servant in the discharge of his public functions was filed by police against unidentified persons, said Alibaug senior inspector Harshal Patil. The same bus driver has also registered an FIR under IPC sections 323, 353 and 504 of the IPC at Poynad police station against unidentified persons after two passengers waiting for the bus at Karle village waylaid the bus and manhandled him. “The passengers were irked after the driver did not halt at the bus stop even though passengers were eagerly waiting for the bus,” Patil said. The MSRTC strike was observed at over 50% bus depots in the state on Monday, with Mumbai depots in Kurla and Mumbai Central shut as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-on-hc-order-state-govt-forms-panel-to-hear-28-msrtc-unions/articleshow/87594387.cms||Somit Sen

---||Ahmedabad||70 cr ‘gaumaya diyas’ glimmer in fest||Ahmedabad: Even without the presence of an established organization like Rashtriya Kamdhenu Aayog, cow entrepreneurs created and sold about 70 crore ‘gaumaya diyas’ — Diwali lamps made of cow dung — in this festive season. This is almost double the number compared to the figures of last season, when cow entrepreneurs across the country made and sold about 40 crore gaumaya diyas during the Diwali season. A majority of the Diwali lamps made this year were sold online, said those involved in promoting the concept. While last year about 25 sellers on an e-commerce portal sold gaumaya diyas, this year the number rose drastically to over 600. Rashtriya Kamdhenu Aayog has been defunct since the beginning of this year. But former RKA chairman Vallabh Kathiria’s team organized a number of webinars and networked with organizations across the country to include hundreds of gaushalas (cow shelters) and dozens of self-help groups around India to produce and sell Diwali lamps made of cow dung. Shatabdi Pandey, the national women’s president of Sahakar Bharati, one of the partner organizations involved in making gaumaya diyas, said it is difficult to state how many diyas were made of cow dung this festive season. But, Pandey said, the number will be much higher than last year’s. “Most of the beneficiaries in Chhattisgarh have been women’s self-help groups. More than one crore gaumaya diyas were made this season in Chhattisgarh alone,” she said. “Other products made of cow dung are also being sold in huge numbers.” Kathiria said that the number of gaumaya diyas sold this season is likely to cross the 100 crore mark. “The sales will continue until Dev Diwali,” he said. “More importantly, cow-based entrepreneurship is now firmly established in India.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/70-cr-gaumaya-diyas-glimmer-in-fest/articleshow/87593738.cms||Meghdoot Sharon
---||Meerut||Kairana 'exodus' a matter of honour for country: Yogi||Meerut: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath said in Kairana, in Shamli district, on Monday that those with "Talibani mindset will not be tolerated in Uttar Pradesh". Referring to the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots and the Kairana "exodus", he added, “For us, the Kairana exodus was a matter of honour for the state, as well as the country. The criminals who had forced Kairana businessmen to flee their homes are themselves compelled to follow the exodus process now.” Late BJP leader Hukum Singh, who had represented the Kairana assembly seat seven times before he moved on as MP in 2014, had first raised the issue of "exodus" of businessmen from a certain community due to threat from criminal elements in 2016. Yogi said those families that had migrated to other areas from Kairana between 2014 and 2016 and have now returned would be given compensation and assistance to re-establish themselves. The Kairana "exodus" had found special mention in the BJP's manifesto for the 2017 state polls. Yogi also laid the foundation for projects worth Rs 426 crore, including the establishment of a Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) Battalion at a cost of Rs 250 crore in Kairana. Attacking the opposition, the CM said, "Those for whom votes were everything honoured the rioters of Muzaffarnagar and criminals of Kairana...Whosoever tries to instigate riots today, his future generations will remember the consequences." On the issue of farmers -- large parts of western UP have in recent days seen farmers from all faiths coming together to protest the centre's three farm laws -- the UP CM targeted opposition parties and said, "What did they do for farmers when they were in power? We have waived loans to the tune of Rs 36,000 crore to 86 lakh farmers in the last four-and-a-half years." Yogi is scheduled to visit Deoband, which houses the world-renowned Islamic seminary Darul Uloom, on Wednesday. Last week, Darul Uloom had declared that "the Islamic seminary has decided not to entertain any political leader during the election season”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/kairana-exodus-a-matter-of-honour-for-country-yogi/articleshow/87592997.cms||Sandeep Rai

It added that the litigations involving the state are looked after only by the departments concerned and not by the office of the chief secretary. “The members of the Bar will also agree that even as per the rules, the state should be a party through the secretary/principal secretary of the department concerned,” added the draft.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/dont-make-chief-secretary-a-party-in-every-case-relating-to-the-state-hc-asks-advocates/articleshow/87593009.cms||---

Banerjee announced that the 27th edition of the Kolkata International Film Festival (KIFF) will be held from January 7 to 14, 2022. A first-ever Bengal global music festival is also on the cards. With the Red Road as its venue, this festival will feature local artists and cater to a global audience. However, the dates of this music festival are yet to be declared. Both announcements were welcomed by members of the film and music fraternities. There is also a buzz that the 27th KIFF might see a change in the chairmanship with Parambrata Chatterjee at the helm of affairs. When TOI got in touch with the chairman of 26th KIFF, Raj Chakraborty, he said, “I am always there for KIFF, but I also believe that everyone should get an opportunity to work. I have been the chairman for two editions of KIFF. I have given this proposal to our chief minister and am awaiting her decision. At Monday’s programme, she asked us to work hard and make the festival a success.” The KIFF team is working in full swing to ensure the festival lives up to cine-buffs’ expectations. “There have been suggestions of Finland being chosen as the focus country. However, the official decision is yet to be taken,” said a source. Centenary celebrations of three film personalities are also being planned. Special segments will be organized on Satyajit Ray, critic, director and film historian Chidananda Dasgupta and Hungarian director and screenwriter Miklos Jancso. Dasgupta directed ‘Portrait of a City’ (1961), ‘The Dance of Shiva’ (1968), The Stuff of Steel’ (1969), ‘Rakhto’ (1973), ‘Bilet Pherat’ (1972), ‘Zaroorat Ki Purti’ (1979) and ‘Amodini’ (1994) while Jancso is known for his ‘The Round-Up’ (1965), ‘The Red and the White’ (1967), ‘Red Psalm’ (1971) and ‘Electra, My Love’ (1974). Plans are on for organizing tributes to Buddhadeb Dasgupta, who passed away on June 10 and Dilip Kumar, who passed away on July 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cm-announces-kiff-music-fest-plans-at-bijoya-sammilani/articleshow/87593007.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

The bone-chilling incident was caught entirely on a CCTV camera installed in a shop nearby and several videos of the murder started making the rounds on social media subsequently. In one of the video garbs, Haroon Ahmed, the purported accused, can be seen walking up to Ali, who was standing next to a few people in an empty plot. Ahmed, in white shirt, can be seen lunging towards Ali, a local jeweller, with a knife and slitting his throat and stabbing him repeatedly. Ahmed can thereafter be spotted being pulled away by a few onlookers who can be seen punching him. In another footage of the incident, an e-rickshaw driver can be seen running away from the spot after seeing Ahmed's assault on Ali while a shopkeeper quickly downs his shop’s shutter. Speaking to TOI, Saharanpur SP (City) Rajesh Kumar said, “We have booked Haroon Ahmed for murder. He confessed that he was looking for an opportunity to kill Shaukat Ali. He alleged that Shaukat had an illicit relationship with his wife. The accused will be sent to jail on Tuesday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/onlookers-gape-in-shock-as-mans-throat-slit-in-busy-up-market/articleshow/87593032.cms||Ishita Mishra

Many have even approached the manufacturers hoping to return unsold inventory. Far from the situation in May-June when private players faced a crisis of shortage, they were sitting on more than 47lakh doses in October last week. Hospitals in Mumbai may have more than 85% of the unsold doses. Vaccinations in the city’s private sector nosedived in October with less than 3lakh paid jabs administered. Sanjeevani Hospital in Malad has 7,000 doses of Covishield worth Rs 44lakh and hardly any takers. “I’ve approached both the manufacturer and BMC, but nobody is willing to take the vaccines,” said Dr Sunil Agarwal, the hospital’s director. “We are willing to liquidate it at a discount of 30%...it is better than doses going to waste altogether,” he said. The hospital’s daily footfall for vaccination has dropped to 20-25 people, far below the crowd of 1,000 they had previously. Read AlsoPost Diwali, 5 lakh take shots in Maharashtra, 1 lakh in Mumbai; state vax may hit 10cr todayAfter the lull during Diwali and weeks leading to the festival, vaccination picked up significantly on Monday with nearly 5 lakh doses administered across the state, including one lakh in Mumbai. The state is likely to complete 10 crore Covid-19 vaccinations on Tuesday.In a similar dilemma is Oscar Hospital in the western suburbs with around 25,000 doses. Dr Nitin Pawar said, “We have all threes—Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik, but hardly any people are coming forward,” Dr Pawar said. Oscar, like many others, is pinning hopes on the government approving a booster shot. “The other way we may see a surge in demand is if the interval between doses is reduced,” he said. The corporation had said more than 22 lakh people would be eligible for vaccination immediately if the 84-day interval is shortened. Read AlsoGet Covid-19 jab or lose salary: Thane Municipal Corporation to staffsThe Thane Municipal Corporation has decided to stop the salaries of all its employees and contract staff who have failed to take the Covid-19 vaccine dose till date, mayor Naresh Mhaske announced Monday.Dr Prince Surana, CEO of Surana Group of Hospitals said many hospitals are trying to sell stocks at discounts, but few have found buyers. CoWin allows private hospitals to transfer doses to each other. “That option is used mainly when someone is in urgent need of 100-200 doses. If anybody wants more doses, they usually place orders directly with manufacturers,” he said. Another hospital head said he spoke to the Serum Institute of India to ask them to take some doses back. “They turned it down saying they cannot be sure how the vaccines were stored,” he said. The extension of expiry period of Covaxin from 6 month to 12 months has brought some relief though, he said. Coronavirus live updatesA state official said private hospitals have offered vaccines to the government. “But we cannot buy from private sector when there is abundant supply from the Centre,” the official said. Interestingly, no hospital has slashed rates despite the oversupply.

---||Ludhiana||‘No city in world can match Mumbai in its fight against Covid’||Patiala: Since social distancing was not possible in Dharavi that has more than 2.27 lakh persons living per sq km and a total population of 6.5 lakh, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) got 48,000 rooms in over 211 hotels of the megacity. The civic body moved around 25,000 persons, showing Covid-19 symptoms, into these rooms and other places every week to isolate and monitor them. This was just one of the several strategies that allowed the financial capital of India to get through the worst of the pandemic, despite witnessing 7.48 lakh Covid cases in the past 18 months. The handling of the situation earned widespread praise for BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal. On Monday, these efforts also brought the 1989-batch IAS officer a degree of Doctor of Science (Honoris Causa) from Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology (TIET), Patiala. The deemed university, during its 35th convocation, decided to honour its alumnus Chahal, who had earned his engineering degree in electronics and communication back in 1987, for "his exceptional work as municipal commissioner of Greater Mumbai in leading the fight against the second wave of the pandemic”. In the past eight years, the varsity has not conferred such honour on anyone, with former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh being the last one to be felicitated like this. During his brief address and media interaction here, Chahal shared more details like how the civic body spent Rs 1,900 crore combating Covid. BMC is India’s richest civic body, with an annual budget of ₹39,000 crores but it also looks after a population of around 1.28 crore. “Each of the 24 wards of Mumbai fought its own battle against Covid, with a war room and teams of doctors, paramedics, and equipment. A dashboard provides information about the allocation of beds at a single click. All private hospitals were banned from allotting their beds,” Chahal said. “We had 30,000 beds. We had jumbo hospitals and field hospitals to treat the patients. In decision-making, the mind of an engineer relies on mathematics. The technology and data-driven system helped us. Tell me one city in the world that can match Mumbai in its fight against Covid.” The Supreme Court of India seemed to agree as it had asked Delhi and other states to “draw from the (Mumbai) experience.” “Now, we have the highest vaccination percentage, with first does to 99% and second to 62% in Mumbai city. By December 31, we would have achieved 100% vaccination,” he told TOI. In the second wave, from February to the first week of June, not on a single working day any financial institution or bank or shop was closed, thanks to Mumbai’s unique model of lockdown, Chahal said, adding, “this is how we achieved the lowest mortality rate”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/no-city-in-world-can-match-mumbai-in-its-fight-against-covid/articleshow/87593752.cms||Bharat Khanna

The CI, who had already deposed before the commission, was called again to identify his brown pistol pouch with two velcro flaps and a loop. Reddy explained that the stitching at the bottom of the loop which went around his waist belt came off when Arif forcibly pulled it using both the hands and the pouch containing weapon went into the hands of the accused. The CI said that he was in forward bending position digging for articles of Disha with his left hand while holding dragon light in his right hand when Arif threw soil in his eyes and snatched the weapon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ci-quizzed-on-accused-snatching-pistol/articleshow/87593750.cms||---
---||Kolkata||New pumping station to end Kidderpore’s inundation woes||Kolkata: Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) on Friday will inaugurate the much-awaited drainage pumping station at Kabitirtha Park (Kidderpore). The station is expected to spare residents of the Kidderpore and Mominpore-Ekbalpore belt of severe inundation in case of heavy rain. The KMC sewerage and drainage department took up the project three years ago, keeping in mind the ordeal of residents of areas such as Dent Mission Road, Sudhir Bose Road, Kabitirtha Sarani, Karl Marx Sarani and Satya Doctor Road, among other areas, which would go under water every monsoon. According to a KMC drainage department official, the station will take load off the existing Mominpore drainage pumping station that was failing to drain out storm water from large areas of Kidderpore-Ekbalpore belt. “We were in search of a land in Kidderpore for several years and finally found a plot at Kabitirtha Park in 2018 for construction of the drainage pumping station. It will give more than 50,000 residents from waterlogging woes,” the civic official said. According to Tarak Singh, a member of the KMC board of administrators overseeing the sewerage and drainage department, the new drainage pumping station would be effective as it is equipped with heavy-duty pumps with a screen facility for removal of plastics and solids from stormwater. “We have constructed a modern drainage pumping station to give thousands of Kidderpore residents relief from inundation,” Singh said. A KMC drainage department official said pipes were laid to connect the drainage pumping station to Tolly’s Nullah. Mohammed Aslam, a lawyer who stays close to Kidderpore Fancy Market, expressed hope that the new drainage pumping station would bring relief from inundation. “We are scared of monsoon as a downpour in our neighbourhood invariably leads to inundation of large areas. Hope the new pumping station will offer us relief from that sinking feeling from next year,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-pumping-station-to-end-kidderpores-inundation-woes/articleshow/87593018.cms||Saikat Ray

Additional chief medical officer and district immunization officer (DIO) Dr Teerath Lal told TOI, over 61% of targeted recipients of all age groups were given at least first dose, while 19.66 percent of targeted recipients are fully vaccinated till now.  “The department is now focusing on rural areas for vaccination campaigns to cover all eligible recipients this month,” he added. Dr Lal further added that they are identifying pockets in rural area where vaccination was low and special teams would be deputed to cover the eligible recipients. Recently, senior health officials had interacted with ground level health worker, including ANMs, ASHA and staff nurses to increase vaccination in rural area and also to find out reasons behind low vaccination in rural areas. Senior medical officer, Dr Anupam Dwivedi said, “Teams have been engaged to promote vaccination in rural areas and urge women to take jabs. Health workers are knocking doors in all villages and blocks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/women-retain-lead-in-vaccination-over-males/articleshow/87588841.cms||---

Devansh’s mother Abha opened a parlour for sustenance and funding her son’s education. However, the misfortune did not end and Abha succumbed to Covid-19 on May 2 in the second wave. Left without parents, Devansh was brought to Lucknow by his septuagenarian maternal grandfather Rajesh Pandey who lives in Chowk. “Life has been very cruel to Devansh and I don’t know what will happen to him after me. My two sons living in Gujarat with their families send money from which I’m paying his school fee. We contacted authorities for government aid, but till date nothing has happened,” said Pandey, who is often unwell due to old age. After learning that government’s women and child welfare is identifying orphans who have lost parents to Covid, Pandey is preparing documents to apply for Union government’s ‘PM-CARES for Children’ scheme under which the child will get a monthly stipend on turning 18 and Rs 10 lakh on reaching the age of 23 besides free education, health insurance and financial support for uniform, books, and notebooks. Director, women and child welfare, Manoj Rai told TOI, “In UP, we have identified 328 orphans who lost both parents during pandemic. Such orphans are eligible for the central government’s scheme. Our department has started their documentation, so that apart from benefits of state government’s UP Mukhyamantri Bal Vikas Yojana-Covid, the orphans also get Rs 10 lakh aid under central government scheme.” However, the scheme does not cover orphans who don’t have proof of Covid death claim. “Life has been cruel on us. We expect the government should consider our claim with mercy. I lost both parents to corona infection within a month. They both died at home, and so I don’t have a death certificate to prove Covid death. Local hospitals refused to admit my mother while she had all symptoms of corona, and my father died way before we could understand anything,” said 17-year-old Madhur Singh Yadav, an intermediate student, of Ganga Kheda village in Malihabad.

---||Kanpur||Uttar Pradesh govt identifies 328 Covid orphans for Rs 10 lakh PM-CARES corpus each||LUCKNOW: Devansh Dixit was just 11 when his father Akhil Dixit, an administrative officer at a private medical college in Bareilly, succumbed to massive cardiac arrest in November 2019. Devansh’s mother Abha opened a parlour for sustenance and funding her son’s education. However, the misfortune did not end and Abha succumbed to Covid-19 on May 2 in the second wave. Left without parents, Devansh was brought to Lucknow by his septuagenarian maternal grandfather Rajesh Pandey who lives in Chowk. “Life has been very cruel to Devansh and I don’t know what will happen to him after me. My two sons living in Gujarat with their families send money from which I’m paying his school fee. We contacted authorities for government aid, but till date nothing has happened,” said Pandey, who is often unwell due to old age. After learning that government’s women and child welfare is identifying orphans who have lost parents to Covid, Pandey is preparing documents to apply for Union government’s ‘PM-CARES for Children’ scheme under which the child will get a monthly stipend on turning 18 and Rs 10 lakh on reaching the age of 23 besides free education, health insurance and financial support for uniform, books, and notebooks. Director, women and child welfare, Manoj Rai told TOI, “In UP, we have identified 328 orphans who lost both parents during pandemic. Such orphans are eligible for the central government’s scheme. Our department has started their documentation, so that apart from benefits of state government’s UP Mukhyamantri Bal Vikas Yojana-Covid, the orphans also get Rs 10 lakh aid under central government scheme.” However, the scheme does not cover orphans who don’t have proof of Covid death claim. “Life has been cruel on us. We expect the government should consider our claim with mercy. I lost both parents to corona infection within a month. They both died at home, and so I don’t have a death certificate to prove Covid death. Local hospitals refused to admit my mother while she had all symptoms of corona, and my father died way before we could understand anything,” said 17-year-old Madhur Singh Yadav, an intermediate student, of Ganga Kheda village in Malihabad. The youngest among three siblings, he lost his father Amrit Lal Yadav, a home guard last posted in secretariat, on March 9, while mother Maya Devi succumbed on April 25. Govt to release Rs 14cr for non-Covid orphans Taking cognizance of the TOI report published on October 16 about non-Covid orphans waiting for financial help, the state government is likely to release a lump sum of Rs 14 crore within a fortnight. Maximum two orphans from each family would be paid Rs 2,500 per month till they reach the age of 18. There are over 2,500 orphans in the state who don’t have Covid certificates to prove the cause of death of their parents. There are over 50 families that have more than two orphans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/govt-identifies-328-covid-orphans-for-rs-10-lakh-pm-cares-corpus/articleshow/87603166.cms||Arvind Chauhan

ZP CEO Leena Bansod recently signed the MoU with the NGO that will help the health department administer Covid vaccine doses to people in far-flung areas of the four tribal blocks — Igatpuri, Peth, Trimbakeshwar and Surgana. District health officer Dr Kapil Aher said the vaccination drive will start in Igatpuri first, and then will be carried out in the other talukas. One of the ambulances has already arrived in Igatpuri. “Under the agreement, the NGO will bear the cost of fuel and maintenance of the ambulances, and provide the driver. It will also give a data entry operator who will register the beneficiaries. The health department will provide a medical officer, nurse and other staff along with vaccines that will be administered to the beneficiaries,” Dr Kailas Bhoye, in-charge of the vaccination programme for rural Nashik, said. It may be noted that when there was shortage of syringes for vaccination in the district, the administration had approached the same NGO, which had provided 2.4 lakh syringes to the health administration free of cost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-zp-teams-up-with-ngo-for-vaccination-in-tribal-talukas/articleshow/87593772.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Like other members of the police team, which was involved in the alleged encounter, SI Ravi too followed their line. The SI, who opened fire from an SLR rifle during the alleged encounter, stated that he opened fire in the direction of sound of firing from the accused as per the orders of ACP V Surender. Commission’s advocate Virupaksha Gouda then asked the SI why he had not stated the same before IO J Surender Reddy, while referring to his 161 CrPC statement recorded by the IO. Ravi maintained that he had stated the same to the IO and he did not know why it was not recorded in his 161 CrPC statement. “Nothing was written in my presence when I was examined by the IO and what was written was not shown to me,” the SI said. SI Ravi also denied making certain statements before an NHRC team when the commission’s advocate pointed out that some statements made by him before the commission were in variance with the ones made before NHRC. Responding to specific queries, Ravi said that he did not state before the NHRC team that he had first opened fire towards Md Arif and then towards J Naveen and C Chennakeshavulu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nothing-written-in-my-presence-when-examined-by-io-si-ravi/articleshow/87593770.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Kolkata||8 short films on same-sex relationship to be screened at schools to promote inclusiveness||Kolkata: Eight short films on same-sex relationship — made by young film-makers that have been shortlisted for Prayasam’s Bad and Beautiful World Film Festival — will be screened at several schools after the reopening of educational institutes in the state. A partner organisation of UNICEF, Prayasam, works to create an environment where the youth can be self-empowered. “The young makers – Salim Shekh, Manish Chowdhury, Saptarshi Ray, Salim Shekh and Avijit Marjit — hail from Dakhindari, Mahishbathan, Nazrul Pally. They are students of Prasayam Visual Basics-Asia’s only grassroot film studio that is supported by Adobe. The main objective of the screenings is to promote inclusive education so that LGBTQ youth do not feel isolated or unwanted. The films will be screened at several schools after they reopen,” said Prayasam’s director Prasanta Roy. These films titled RESH (reverberance) deal with fictionalised accounts of same-sex relationships to explore diverse subjects such as companionship, child abuse, acceptance, identity crisis and a spectrum of other human emotions. Some of the ideas are interesting though the execution has room for improvement. Salim Shekh’s ‘Dekha’, for instances, records a meeting between an estranged father and his gay son. ‘Dakkhina’ explores the concept of dignity of a male escort who is driven around the city by an elderly man. “Some of my friends who are male escorts have insisted that self-respect is very important for them. By making this film, I wanted to break the myth that society has about their self-esteem for their life’s choices,” said its 23-year-old director Salim Shekh. ‘Durbin’ is edgy. It explores how a journalist opens up to his live-in partner about the crisis in his life after the demise of his father who, he learnt, was involved in a rewarding relationship with his friend. Its 24-year-old director Saptarshi Ray told TOI that getting the casting and locations were challenging. “Actors went back after listening to the storyline. That’s why it is all the more important to screen these films so that these inhibitions are done away with,” Ray said. ‘Deya Neya’ brings in the class difference within the ambit of a developing relationship between a man and a food delivery boy. “In just over 15 minutes, I have tried to explore how socio-economic hurdles pose as greater problems for thriving of such relationships,” said its 24-year-old director Manish Chowdhury. The films will premiere on December 3 at the 8th Bad and Beautiful World Film Festival at Kalanjali Art Space.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/8-short-films-on-same-sex-relationship-to-be-screened-at-schools-to-promote-inclusiveness/articleshow/87593030.cms||---

The state is likely to complete 10 crore Covid-19 vaccinations on Tuesday. According to CoWin, a total of 4,89,479 doses were administered in the state on Monday, taking the number of cumulative vaccinations to 9.96 crore. The state has given at least one dose to 6.8 crore people, while 3.2 crore people have been fully vaccinated. In the first week of November, the average daily vaccination dropped to less than 1.5 lakh. In Mumbai, a total of 1,07,155 doses were administered on Monday, taking the total vaccination to 1,43,99,698. The city has administered at least one dose of the vaccine to 99% of its adult population of 92.4 lakh. As per CoWin, 62% had received both the doses in Mumbai till Monday. Of the 1 lakh doses, 85,933 were the second and 21,222 first. Dr Mangala Gomare, the BMC’s executive health officer, said they have started putting the focus on second dose vaccinations. Ward level war rooms have already started calling people who are due for the second dose. “We may also put up camps in areas if there are many waiting for the second dose and there are accessibility issues,” said Dr Gomare. Civic officials say there could be three categories of people whose names are missing from second dose recipients, people who got vaccinated outside Mumbai, who have got vaccinated with both doses but their records have not got updated due to a glitch and people who are due but haven’t yet taken the jab. Across the state, more than 2.35 crore people are waiting to get their first doses.  A state official said with door-to-door vaccination starting in several districts, the numbers are expected to rise over the next few weeks. State officials were previously hopeful that nearly all eligible person would get at least one shot of the vaccine before the end of the year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-post-diwali-5l-take-shots-in-maha-1l-in-city-state-vax-may-hit-10cr-today/articleshow/87593774.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Kids find new stomping ground as some private schools reopen||NEW DELHI: Three-year-old Eklavya Thakur went to school for the first time on Monday. The delighted nursery student romped around, played on the slide and swing, and told his mother, “Let us stay here always,” when the time allotted for his batch ended at 11.30am. While first timers like Thakur were excited when many private schools resumed classes on Monday, the attendance otherwise was very thin at around 25 per cent of the regular student strength. Thakur’s mother said her tot had got up at 5am and was elated all the way to Oxford Angel Public School at Chhatarpur. Despite the risks of Covid infection, which had closed the city’s schools for almost 20 months, the parents, like Thakur’s mother, expressed relief that their children could return to school. As the mother of Mohammad Hussain, a nursery entrant in the same school, said, “We have to make a start somewhere. How long can we keep the children at home?” The institutions did their best to comply with the Covid precautions, careful to ensure that the returning junior students were under the robust supervision of the teachers and the helps. They were constantly reminded to wear their mask and not to share a desk with any other student. With fewer students attending, the schools were able to leave the alternative desks empty too. Entry was staggered with some classes beginning at 8.30am and others, especially the lowest ones from nursery to Class I, at 9.30am. Sanjana Vashist of Class VI said with much feeling, “I really hope the school doesn’t close now. Online classes are not good. We don’t get to meet friends too.” Most students preferred to stay home on Monday and continue with online lessons. Manash Joshi of Class V was one of them. “I am in my hometown in Uttarakhand,” he explained over phone to TOI. At SR Capital Public School, less than a third of the students returned. The school had placed hand sanitisers in each classroom and cautioned students not to touch each other and not to share their food. Many schools have decided to reopen only after November 11, with students attending school just once or twice a week. Jyoti Arora, principal, Mount Abu Public School, Rohini, said, “As Diwali is a festival where people interact a lot, we thought we should allow a three-day break before restarting school.” MM Public School, Pitampura, is also biding its time, though its principal, Rooma Pathak, revealed, “We have received the consent of 60 per cent of the parents for the return of nursery-VIII students.” Some schools, such as Amity International, have opted to continue with online classes till November 22. Principal Divya Bhatia said, “We are waiting to see if Covid cases increase after the festival. Pollution is also a problem.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kids-find-new-stomping-ground-as-some-private-schools-reopen/articleshow/87593775.cms||Shradha Chettri

---||Aurangabad||Admin firm on razing 328 quarters in Labour Colony||Aurangabad: With the deadline given by the district administration to vacate 328 residential quarters spread across 20 acre of labour colony coming to an end, the residents, opposing the move, carried out a sit-in protest on Monday. Amidst series of delegations making representations to district guardian minister Subhash Desai, divisional commissioner Sunil Kendrekar and district collector Sunil Chavan, authorities indicated that the rule of law will be followed while demolishing the residential quarters including the ones that date back to 1953. While refusing to give any concrete assurance to the residents, Desai said, “As already different courts have given rulings in this case, it will be inappropriate for me to say anything on the issue.” Sources said that the authorities will begin with carrying out legal action for demolishing all the structures that have been tagged as dilapidated and dangerous for living. After making a representation to Desai, MP Imtiaz Jaleel said, “Without going into the merits of the case, I am of the view that we need to take a considerate and humanitarian view, and settle the families somewhere else instead of making them homeless.” While citing the example of rehabilitation programme carried out for clearing encroachments from land for constructing Haj house and Vande Mataram Hall, Jaleel suggested that the PM Awas Yojana and CM housing scheme should be used for settling the people being displaced due to the demolition drive. NCP state office bearer Abdul Qadeer Maulana went on to state that making people homeless will send a wrong message about Maha Vikas Aghadi government in the state. He demanded that an inspection be carried out to identify legitimate residents, before taking any further action. Swarahi Verma, a resident of the area, said, “A structural audit report has been prepared without physically inspecting and auditing the structures. Moreover, the state government does not own this land.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/admin-firm-on-razing-328-quarters-in-labour-colony/articleshow/87593762.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Meerut||'To mitigate corruption', govt directly transfers funds for school uniforms into parents' bank a/c||Bijnor: In view of the delays in distributing uniforms for winter to students in government primary and upper primary schools in the past, this year, the funds have been directly transferred into the bank accounts of their parents in Uttar Pradesh. Each parent will get Rs 1,100 to buy winter dresses for their ward. Senior officials from the education department have lauded the move, saying it will eliminate corruption. Jai Karan Yadav, Bijnor’s basic shiksha adhikari (BSA), said, “The move will bring transparency in the system.” Earlier, the uniforms, shoes and school bags were directly distributed by the education department to the students studying in classes I to VIII free of cost. The process led to inordinate delays and complaints of poor quality and wrong sizes were galore. Now, it would be the responsibility of the parents or guardians of the students of government and government-aided primary schools to directly buy the uniforms, shoes, socks, sweaters and school bags of their wards with the money provided. However, not all parents have received the funds for buying the uniforms. In Bijnor district, a sum of Rs 1 lakh has been transferred directly into the bank accounts of the parents/guardians of the students. However, the money is yet to be transferred into the bank accounts of the parents of over 1.5 lakh students as their account numbers are either incorrect or are not linked with their Aadhaar cards, officials said. According to records, there are 2,556 primary and upper primary schools in Bijnor district in which 2.5 lakh students are enrolled. Jai Karan Yadav, Bijnor’s basic shiksha adhikari (BSA), said, “We are uploading data on the Prerna portal of the education department. Corrections are being carried out. People whose bank accounts are not linked with their Aadhaar card have been asked to get them connected. The district administration has instructed bank officials to cooperate with the parents and set up a separate counter in their respective banks. The process is going on. I hope we will meet the target soon."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/to-mitigate-corruption-govt-directly-transfers-funds-for-school-uniforms-into-parents-bank-a/c/articleshow/87593037.cms||Harveer Dabas

The state Covid update on Monday showed that 751 cases and 15 deaths were registered in Maharashtra. However, the low tally could also be the result of fewer tests being conducted due to Diwali, said state officials. Only 61,720 tests were conducted in the state as against the usual 1.2 lakh to 1.5 lakh. State health officials said people weren’t turning up for testing due to the festival. “As duplicate cases were found during Diwali (between November 4 and 7), the state tally has decreased by 58,’’ said state surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate. The state tally since March 2020 stands at 66,18,347 In Mumbai, where the Covid graph has been on a decline since June, only 13 buildings are sealed as against 30-plus last week. On Monday, the city continued with its five-day trend of registering less than 300 cases (206). Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state government task force, said the public health department has to stay vigilant as there was crowding and socializing during Diwali. “We could see the effect in the next two weeks,” he said, adding the next fortnight is crucial. Dr Joshi said there could be a slight increase due to the socialization. “However, the health officials should use this time to locate people who have taken the vaccine and counsel them to take the shot,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-reports-less-than-1000-cases-for-four-days-in-a-row/articleshow/87593782.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Air travel soars to pre-Covid level with 3.7L flyers in a day||Mumbai: The last Sunday of the Diwali festive season travel saw airlines transport a record 3.7 lakh domestic passengers on over 2,700 flights, the highest volume of passengers flown in a single day since the outbreak of the pandemic. In November 2019, airlines flew an average of about 4.2 lakh passengers per day. In comparison then, airlines flew about 11.6 % fewer passengers on November 7 as compared to the per day passenger volume in November 2019. When compared with February 2020, the last pre-Covid month, the drop is about 10.6 %, indicating that domestic passenger traffic has inched quite close to the pre-Covid number. Prior to November 7, a traffic peak was registered on October 31, a Saturday when airlines carried 3.3 lakh passengers. “Domestic air traffic is touching new heights, one after the other, inching sloe to pre-Covid levels,” tweeted civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia. The latest record comes in the wake of an outstanding October month when airlines carried about 88 lakh domestic passengers, which was only about 27 % fewer passengers than those carried in October 2019. But the growth was weekend-specific, with passenger numbers climbing on Saturdays and Sundays, only to dip to the lowest on Tuesdays. The big question though is whether November will continue to see record number of passengers boarding flights. “The demand for air travel brought on by Diwali will ease in the coming days. So the traffic patterns on the coming weekends and weekdays of this month will show the extent to which the market has recovered. After leisure travel and travel to visit friends and relatives, we expect travel for work to pick up this month. But air fares are high on flights less than 3 to 4 weeks out, which is typically the booking window for corporate travellers,” said an airline official, requesting anonymity. “If corporate travel picks up, we expect to see a rise in demand for weekday travel. But it won’t be anywhere close to the Diwali peaks,” said an airline official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-air-travel-soars-to-pre-covid-level-with-3-7l-flyers-in-a-day/articleshow/87593790.cms||---

The accused had started working at the society a couple of months ago. The woman lives alone, said the police, adding that her relatives visit her twice a week. “On November 3, the woman’s neighbours found her crying. Assuming that she had hurt herself or was suffering from some ailment, they took her to hospital, where doctors found that she had been sexually assaulted,” said Sanjay Dhumal, senior inspector of Naupada police station. Subsequently, a case of rape was registered under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code. After enquiring with neighbours, the police zeroed in on the security guard. “He was detained and during questioning, he confessed to the crime,” said a police officer. The guard was arrested and produced before a local court which remanded him to judicial custody. The woman is presently with her relatives and her condition is stable, the police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-guard-held-for-raping-mentally-ill-sr-citizen/articleshow/87594449.cms||Nishikant Karlikar

The initiative will be first of it’s kind to be implemented at any airport across the country.” The aim to launch the initiative is to spread awareness about the disease, which goes unnoticed till the patient gets critically ill. Kataria said that the local representatives too will be involved in launching the initiative to ensure maximum passengers benefit. The airport is witnessing huge footfall daily after the second wave of Covid eased to a large extent. Also, the count is going to increase once the airport is connected to more places. “Airports are major transit places, which can also be used to create awareness about health-related issues. The doctors will hold counselling sessions for passengers to help them identify the health concerns,” added Kataria.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/free-cancer-check-up-at-kolhapur-airport-soon/articleshow/87593793.cms||---

A few parents contacted TOI and said CBSE could have gone for an online version of this exam and held the offline one in summer. “Will the school take guarantee of our kids when they go to the campus?” asked a parent. “Who knows what kids will do in excitement once they see their friends after a long time. There is no doubt that all safety guidelines will go for a toss as school will only be concerned about conducting the exam in a fair manner, rather than within the safety protocols,” the parent said. Schools have been permitted to reopen in physical mode in Maharashtra. In cities, only Std VIII and above and are allowed while in rural areas, Std V and above are allowed. A parent said, “That’s at least optional. Like I am not sending my son to school. But for board exams, we have no option. Had this been some internal test, I would have even ignored it, but how can anyone miss the board exam?” TOI spoke to a few CBSE schools in Nagpur, who said concerns of parents were unwarranted. “Exams will be conducted using all safety protocols. Schools have already started conducting physical classes under the new normal, so there is great level of awareness among teaching and non-teaching staff about how to conduct these exams too,” a principal said. Another teacher said, “Students will be coming to schools only for the duration of their exam and no loitering on campus will be allowed. Also, only one student per bench will be there, so no risk of coming in close contact with each other. Even while exiting, schools will ensure that there is no crowding.” CBSE is conducting its board exam in two terms this time, a change it made after the summer 2021 board exams got cancelled due to the deadly second wave. It had to improvise to award marks to students but with this first term exam, at least 50% of the assessment will be done.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/parents-worried-over-unvaxxed-kids-appearing-for-cbse-offline-exams/articleshow/87593797.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

He also promised to set up health centres in every village of the taluka. Kejriwal was speaking at public meetings held at the villages of Budruk Karmali and Mauxi on Monday. Assuring the people of ‘mohalla clinics’ — free medical clinics the Delhi CM said, “The villagers of Sattari will not have to visit the community health centre at Valpoi for medicines and health check-ups, which is very far from every village in the taluka.” While interacting with Kejriwal, Govind Sawant, a youth from Coparde, pointed out that Poriem MLA Pratapsingh Rane has ownership rights of properties in Sattari. Sawant said that if the MLA could get his rights, the villagers should be able to, too. People of the taluka have long been demanding that the government take immediate measures to resolve the issue of ownership rights of lands classified as Alvara, Gavthan, Mokashdari, Kumeri and forest. They have also repeatedly slammed successive governments for their failure to resolve the long-pending issue. Agreeing that land ownership is a major grievance in Sattari, Kejriwal said, “I will sit with my legal team and definitely resolve this problem.You all have tried voting for both, BJP and Congress. Now, vote for AAP and see the difference.” The party’s state convener, Rahul Mhambre, assured that network connectivity issues in the remote villages of the taluka would also be resolved if AAP forms the government. “In the recent past, we saw that students, including girls, were forced to trek through forests in search of network to be able to connect to their online classes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-assures-locals-of-mohalla-clinics-in-sattari-villages/articleshow/87593879.cms||---

Chamre (32), a resident of Vadrai fishing village in Palghar, was employed on the Gujarat registered trawler Jal Pari that was caught in a firing by Pakistan Maritime Security Agency (PMSA). The commandos arrived in two boats and fired at the Indian trawler. Three bullets pierced Chamre’s chest, killing him on the spot. A bullet brushed past the cheek of Dilip Solanki (34), the pilot of the trawler and resident of Diu. Based on Solanki’s complaint, Navi Bandar police in Porbandar district filed a case under sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder) and 114 (abettor present when offence is committed) of IPC against 10 unidentified PMSA personnel. In his statement to police, Solanki said 10 men in two boats fired at the trawler near the International Maritime Boundary Line at Jakhau in Kutch. The autopsy of Chamre’s body was performed at Jamnagar government hospital on Monday. MEA officials are believed to have flown into Jamnagar to ascertain the nature of bullets. The Indian government is lodging a strong protest against the firing, which was described as “unprovoked”. Fishermen from Vadrai and Tembhi villages observed a total bandh. Fishing activities were stalled, shops shut and auto kept off the roads. Posters condemning the killing were put up across the district. In the fishing villages of Bhayander and Vasai-Virar, too, locals protested and demanded compensation for the family. Satpati police API Sudhir Daherkar said it was a peaceful protest. Neither the state nor the Centre has issued any statement on compensation for the victim’s family. Chamre is survived by his wife, two minor daughters and parents. At his home in Vadrai, his parents, Ramesh and Anysiya, were waiting for the body to be handed over to them, and for clarity on whether the trawler had entered Pakistan’s territorial waters as claimed by PMSA. The body is expected to arrive early on Tuesday. All arrangements for the funeral have been made, said Manendra Arekar, vice president, Maharashtra Machhimar Kruti Samiti. Police have been deployed in the village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/fir-against-pak-commandosfishermans-body-to-arrive-today/articleshow/87594471.cms||Sandhya Nair

---||Nashik||Groundwater level swells in 5 districts of Nashik division following good rain||Nashik: Good rainfall across all five districts of Nashik division has led to significant rise in the groundwater levels, data shared by Groundwater Survey and Development Agency (GSDA) revealed on Monday. At 1.69m, the highest rise in groundwater level was registered in Jalgaon district while the lowest (0.34m) was recorded in Nandurbar district. “This means that the current groundwater levels are higher than the five-year average levels of the respective regions. The good rainfall led to percolation of water in the ground,” Diwakar Dhote, deputy director of GSDA, said. The GSDA conducts pre-monsoon and post-monsoon survey of groundwater levels through its observation wells that are marked in every watershed area in the districts. The average water levels of each of the districts have gone up and this is a good sign. Of the 54 talukas in Nashik division, two talukas in Nandurbar and six in Nashik have registered fall in the groundwater levels as compared to their averages. As far as the drop in water levels in Nashik district is concerned, it has been witnessed in the areas where there is assured rainfall. “These areas did not receive good rainfall last monsoon and even this monsoon as a result the recharging of water levels did not happen as intended or they rained heavily at the end of the season,” Dhote said. In Nashik district, the water levels increased by 2.16 meter from 3.39 meter below surface to 1.23 meter below surface in Yeola taluka. Nandgaon taluka that witnessed very heavy rains twice in a fortnight also registered rise of water levels by 1.79 meter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/groundwater-level-swells-in-5-districts-of-nashik-division-following-good-rain/articleshow/87593807.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Former CM Harish Rawat attacked the BJP government over Gairsain's development. “A package of Rs 25,000 crore had been announced by the state. What did they do with the fund?” he questioned. Rawat claimed that if voted to power, the Congress would improve the infrastructure of Gairsain and adjoining areas in the first two to three years and thereafter announce it as the state's capital. Congress state chief Ganesh Godiyal said, "The BJP government has accorded Gairsain the status of summer capital, but the CM needs to tell people how many days he, chief secretary, ministers and state officials have stayed there." Godiyal added that party seniors along with members of Chamoli district would participate in the Gairsain protest on November 29. Godiyal also said that the party had announced an event at Haldwani on November 10 and it was aimed to welcome Yashpal Arya, who had recently joined the party. “Getting information about it, the BJP deliberately organised a CM's programme in a nearby area and we are not allowed to hold the event," he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cong-to-stage-protest-at-gairsain-on-first-day-of-assembly-session/articleshow/87593094.cms||Kautilya Singh

---||Nagpur||After state, NMC too bans Chhath Puja at lakes, but may turn blind eye to violators||Nagpur: First, the Maharashtra government clearly mentioned no public gatherings will be allowed during Chhath Puja. On Monday, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) banned Chhath Puja in public, and instead appealed to Nagpurians to celebrate the festival at their homes. NMC’s order notwithstanding, preparations for Chhath celebrations are on in full swing in Nagpur. Chhath Puja celebrations will commence from Tuesday sunset and will end next morning (November 10) with the sunrise. Umakant Agnihotri, working national president of Uttar Bhartiya Sabha, said the Sabha has already approached district guardian minister Nitin Raut and commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar to allow celebrations of Chhath Puja in public. “Every year, the Sabha organizes preparations for Chhath Puja at 17 water bodies across the district, which include three in city — Ambazari, Police Line Takli lake, and Gorewada lake,” said Agnihotri, adding this year too the Sabha had started preparations long back. He said the Sabha has started preparations as they are very positive that the state government will relax the curbs imposed for Chhath Puja. “Despite celebrations of Navratra and Diwali, the positive cases of Covid-19 are very much in control. So, the Sabha has sought relaxation from Raut and Kumar,” he said. He also claimed that he will approach chief minister Uddhav Thackeray seeking relaxation in norms for Chhath Puja. “Denying celebration of Chhath Puja may hurt religious sentiments of the public, especially north Indians,” he said. Recently, mayor Dayashankar Tiwari too had requested the CM to relax Covid-19 guidelines to allow Chhath Puja at city’s water bodies. The mayor had mentioned decline in Covid-19 cases while seeking relaxations. Agnihotri said the Sabha will ensure 100% compliance of Covid-19 protocols while organizing Chhath Puja in water bodies. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said NMC will be replicating the guidelines issued by the Maharashtra government. “As per the state notification, Chhath Puja celebrations in lakes and rivers has been prohibited due to pandemic,” the additional commissioner said. “So it will be applicable in Nagpur city too,” he said. However, the additional commissioner was quick to point out that there will be no special measures from NMC to prevent citizens from visiting city lakes, especially Ambazari, Police Line Takli and Gorewada. Joshi said immersion of idols in lakes too was banned this year but NMC had arranged for artificial tanks near lakes. “Likewise, we will not ban devotees visiting lakes,” he said, adding NMC is urging citizens not to celebrate the festival in public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-state-nmc-too-bans-chhath-puja-at-lakes-but-may-turn-blind-eye-to-violators/articleshow/87593836.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Mumbai||Mumbai’s fight against Covid unmatched in world: Iqbal Singh Chahal||PATIALA: Since social distancing was not possible in Dharavi that has more than 2.3 lakh persons living per square kilometre and a total population of 6.5 lakh, the BMC got rooms in over 211 hotels in the mega city. The civic body moved around 25,000 individuals with Covid-19 symptoms into these rooms and other places every week to isolate and monitor them. This was just one of the several strategies that allowed the financial capital of India to get through the worst of the pandemic, despite witnessing 7.5 lakh Covid cases in the past 18 months. The handling of the situation earned widespread praise for BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal. “We had 30,000 beds. We had jumbo hospitals and field hospitals to treat patients. In decision-making, the mind of an engineer relies on mathematics. The technology and data-driven system helped us. Tell me of one city in the world that can match Mumbai in its fight against Covid,” said Chahal. The Supreme Court of India had asked Delhi and other states to “draw from the (Mumbai) experience”. On Monday, a degree of Doctor of Science (Honoris Causa) was bestowed upon the 1989-batch IAS officer from Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology (TIET), Patiala. The deemed university, during its 35th convocation, decided to honour its alumnus Chahal, who had earned his engineering degree in electronics and communication back in 1987. In the past eight years, the varsity has not conferred such honour on anyone, with former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh being the last to be felicitated. During his brief address and media interaction here, Chahal shared more details such as how the civic body spent Rs 1,900 crore on combating Covid. The BMC is India’s richest civic body, with an annual budget of Rs 39,000 crore but it also looks after the population of around 1.3 crore. “Each of the 24 wards of Mumbai fought its own battle against Covid, with a war room and teams of doctors, paramedics and equipment. A dashboard provided information about allocation of beds at a single click. All private hospitals were banned from allotting their beds,” Chahal said. “Now, we have the highest vaccination percentage with the first dose at 99% and second 62% in Mumbai. By December 31, we would have achieved 100% vaccination,” he told TOI. In the second wave, on not a single working day was any financial institution or bank or shop closed, thanks to Mumbai’s unique model of “lockdown”, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/chahal-citys-fight-against-covid-unmatched-in-world/articleshow/87593833.cms||Bharat Khanna
---||Mumbai||BMC nod for Chhath puja at artificial ponds in Mumbai, not beaches||MUMBAI: The BMC on Monday issued revised guidelines for celebrating Chhath puja in Mumbai. With the Congress and BJP both protesting over the civic body’s circular issued last week in a bid to woo the North Indian community ahead of the municipal polls, the BMC on Monday said it will construct artificial ponds and bear the cost of these ponds too. However, the new circular has not allowed Chhath Puja on the city’s beaches and sea shores. Chhath Puja, which begins on November 10 and ends the next morning, is mostly celebrated by Bihar and Uttar Pradesh natives. Women fast and pray to the sun and Chhathi Devi for the long life and well being of their husbands and children.  “The number of artificial ponds needed and their locations will be identified at the ward level. The cost of the construction of these artificial ponds will be borne by the BMC. The responsibility of construction and then dousing the ponds will be of the BMC officials,” the corporation said. The civic body has asked devotees to avoid beaches and sea shores. The BMC has instead urged devotees to celebrate the festival in a low-key manner and perform the puja at artificial ponds. The police have been asked to ensure that there is no crowding at beaches. The Congress on Saturday urged Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to allow Chhath Puja and direct the BMC to construct artificial ponds for the puja across the city. Mumbai Congress chief Bhai Jagtap, who wrote to the CM on the issue, also met civic officials on Monday urging them to revise the circular. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said that the BJP too had taken up the issue since the BMC’s previous circular was not clear and was an injustice to devotees from the North Indian community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-nod-for-chhath-puja-at-artificial-ponds-not-beaches/articleshow/87593826.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

According to the combined report released by South Delhi Municipal Corporation, three more deaths have been recorded due to the vector-borne disease, which makes the total official number of confirmed deaths nine — the highest since 2017 when 10 deaths were recorded in a year. Of the 1,171 cases, 942 were reported from the three corporations — 394 from north, 404 from south and east had 144 cases. The remaining cases were reported from other areas like under New Delhi Municipal Council, Delhi Cantonment and Railways. In order to control this outbreak, the corporations carry out fumigation drives, awareness campaigns and surveys of households in different localities to check for breeding of mosquitoes. The civic bodies issue legal notices to houses and building owners where mosquitogenic conditions are detected. Among the deceased from south Delhi was a three-year-old girl from Badarpur and a 12-year-old boy from Durga Vihar Deoli. Under north corporation a 63-year-old Rohini resident succumbed at Maharaja Agrasen hospital. The south corporation has also launched a special three-day drive against mosquitoes from November 5, with a focus on areas from where high number of cases are being reported. All the three corporations have identified such areas and are monitoring them. In these hotspots the civic bodies send a team of domestic breeding checkers and field workers to kill the infected mosquito and create awareness among the residents about the precautions that are required to be taken at such a time. During the survey of localities the domestic breeding checkers mostly check for coolers, pots, containers and storage tanks for signs of mosquito breeding as dengue mosquito breeds in freshwater.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/1171-dengue-cases-in-previous-week-total-for-season-rises-to-2708/articleshow/87593828.cms||---

In a period of nearly two years, protests have been staged at Char Dham, various districts and other parts of Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag and Chamoli. The former CM asserted that the view of priests and other stakeholders was mandatory before making any such decision. “If the people from whom the Act has been brought are not in its favour, then what is the point of doing so. Earlier too, I have said that if we come to power, the Board would be dissolved,” he said, adding that despite repeated commitments to the priests, the BJP government has done nothing for them on the issue. CM Pushkar Singh Dhami during his visit to Uttarkashi on July 15 announced the review of the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Act. While the committee has handed over its interim report to the CM, a final decision is still awaited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/from-our-side-devasthanam-board-remains-dissolved-harish-rawat/articleshow/87593109.cms||Kautilya Singh

---||Chandigarh||Don’t rush into 85th amendment move, CM urged||Patiala: The General Category (GC) Welfare Federation has urged the Punjab government not to take a hasty decision on the implementation of the 85th amendment of the Constitution related to reservation in the state without complying with certain conditions laid down by the Supreme Court in M Nagraj case, such as excluding the creamy layer of scheduled caste employees from the benefit of the accelerated promotion as well as consequential seniority upon promotion should not be allowed. Jaswant Singh Dhaliwal, state president of the federation, in a letter to the Punjab chief minister and other ministers and MLAs, has stated the central and state governments have not yet identified the creamy layer among SC, ST employees as per apex court order so there is no need to implement the 85th amendment in the state. They said in case the government went ahead with the process of implementation of 85th amendment for political gains, the general category employees will be forced to oppose the decision and take the legal course. The federation said in Punjab, SC/ST employees are already in excess of the percentage fixed by the government, then where is the need for continuation of reservation. As per data collected by the state government in 2018, the percentage of SCs in against total filled-up posts in group A is 22.34% against the prescribed quota of 14%. Similarly in group B, it is 19.99% against 14% and in group C it is 24.34% against the share of 20%. V K Gupta, spokesperson of the federation, said fresh data has now been collected for 2021 and it is understood that it is in excess of their prescribed percentage. The data collected by the government should be published for the information of all to know the real position of adequacy. He said the state government has been requested a number of times to establish a state commission for the welfare of the general category as committed by the Congress at the time of the last assembly elections. This is required so that the general category can take up their grievances before such a commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dont-rush-into-85th-amendment-move-cm-urged/articleshow/87593838.cms||---

Residents of Chaura Rasta, Johari Bazaar, Kishapole and many areas of Ghat Gate are having to deal with unhygienic conditions as there are several long-standing issues between the civic bodies and the company responsible for garbage collection. Former Johari Bazaar councillor Vikas Kothari said, "Vehicles are not coming to collect garbage. We had to live with it the entire festive season. We expect the civic bodies to take care of this issue." The councillor of Ward 9, Rajat Bishnoi, said hoopers do not cover the entire ward and they come three times a week. He said they have filed complaints, but the vehicles are not regular. Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC), Heritage, health deputy commissioner, Ashish Verma, said, "We are taking care of the issue of sanitation and will improve the situation sooner. Even on Sundays we picked up garbage. If there is any specific problem in a ward, we will deal with it." The JMC-Heritage has declared that they will start the process of monitoring garbage collection vehicles/hoopers using information technology (IT). Once the system is introduced, the movement of all garbage collecting vehicles can be monitored from the corporation’s office. Till now, only GPS was installed, which just gave information about the location of the vehicle. However, under the new system, details such as where the vehicle went, how many houses it catered to and time spent in front of each house will be monitored. Councillors in the city, however, said first the JMC-Heritage should focus on improving the number of hoopers. They said company workers go on strike despite being short-staffed and there was a tussle related to finances between the corporation and the company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/irregular-garbage-collection-raises-a-stink-in-city/articleshow/87594007.cms||---

The deputy CM also asked to initiate disciplinary action against the police officers who failed to take concrete action against drug smuggling, despite complaints of villagers. The senior superintendents of police (SSPs) have been directed to submit the action taken report within three days. Randhawa, who also holds the charge of home department, said that no laxity in dealing with drug related cases would be tolerated and negligent police officers would not be spared. On the basis of Randhawa’s instructions, principal secretary of the home department has also issued letters to the Moga and Ferozepur district police chiefs, citing that even as the chief minister and the deputy chief minister had directed all SSPs to take strict action against drugs, social media reports suggests that drugs were being sold openly in the said two villages and no concrete action was taken by the police. In the case of Rauli village, people in the village were complaining that the police had not registered any case against one person who had come out on bail and was again involved in selling drugs openly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/drug-cases-deputy-cm-orders-action-against-cops/articleshow/87593978.cms||---

Additional Sessions Judge Ravinder Bedi once again directed the investigating officer (IO) to file a compliance report of the court’s earlier orders directing the police to expedite the investigation to ascertain the head of the paper setting committee who allegedly authorised such paper setting. The court had on October 12 directed the commissioner of Delhi Police to look into the matter and asked for a report within two weeks. On Monday, the court noted that no such response has been filed and the IO stated that the earlier order was received only on October 21. It further noted that Additional Public Prosecutor Rakesh Kumar, appearing for the police, once again requested for short adjournment for placing on record the compliance report as called vide order dated October 12. During the hearing, the public prosecutor had stated that since the FIR was registered under Section 4 of Atrocities Act as well, the application of the complainant as such deserved dismissal being infructuous. The court was earlier informed that an FIR has been lodged under the SC/ST Act though the case was pending adjudication. It had sought an explanation from police. An application was filed by advocate Satya Prakash Gautam seeking action against police officers for allegedly failing to lodge an FIR against the offenders within the timeline in the case. The application is still pending in the court. The court had on February 17 this year directed the officer empowered under the SC/ST Act to conduct an investigation in the matter related to caste-based question and file a monthly report before it in the case. The police had submitted in its status report that they had registered two FIRs in the case on June 21 under the provisions of SC/ST Act. The FIR does not name anyone as accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-no-action-on-caste-based-questions-in-dsssb-exams/articleshow/87593870.cms||Usha Das

---||Trichy||After 14 years, Kudamurutti floods residential areas in Trichy||Trichy: The heavy rainfall in the catchment areas of the Kudamurutti river, which originates from PWD’s aqueduct, has led to the waterbody breaching and inundating several residential areas in Trichy city. Similar situation prevailed in the Koraiyar river also. After 14 years, river breaches were reported at multiple locations of the two rivers in the city.The Koraiyar river that originates from Thennambadi in Pudukkottai district collects the run-off water en route and at the PWD’s aqueduct near Kuzhumayee Amman temple behind Trichy district collectorate. The surplus water from Koraiyar takes a new name as Kudamurutti and runs for 6km through the city to merge with the Cauvery. The heavy rain in the catchment areas such as Manapparai and Viralimalai flooded the Koraiyar at E Pudur and enhanced the water flow in the Kudamurutti. The Kudamurutti inundated Fathima Nagar, Lingam Nagar and Ramalinga Nagar in Trichy city. Around 25,000 cusecs of water was discharged into the Kudamurutti. A walkway to Kuzhumayee Amman temple was completely submerged.The PWD that monitored the water flow said that Trichy Corporation had facilitated many discharge outlets in residential areas to recede the inundation in recent years, another cause for the increased flow besides the surplus rainfall. “The situation is under control as there are no further rain both in the city and in the catchment areas. We expect the flow in the Kudamurutti to reach normalcy by Tuesday,” an official source with PWD said. Weakened bunds were strengthened to stop breaches.As Kudumurutti is taking copious quantum of water, the district administration has released 10,000 cusecs of water into the Kollidam river, a major flood carrier running parallel to Cauvery. After inspecting the inundated areas, district collector S Sivarasu urged people not to take bath, swim, wash clothes and take selfies in the rivers. The Cauvery and Kollidam are not at the risk of flooding since Trichy has not received very heavy rainfall, officials said.Water discharge in rivers/canal(in cusecs)Uyyakondan: 200Kudamurutti: 25,000Koraiyar: 25,000Cauvery: 14,000Kollidam: 10,000Flow CapacityUyyakondan: 798Kudamurutti: 55,000Koraiyar: 55,000Cauvery: 1 lakhKollidam: 2.5 lakhFlooded areasLingam NagarFathima NagarRamalinga NagarE PudurKarumandapamRainfall in Trichy district(till Monday morning)Thenrparanadu: 44 mmTrichy airport: 17.40 mmThuraiyur: 12 mmTrichy town: 9 mm||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/after-14-years-kudamurutti-floods-residential-areas-in-trichy/articleshow/87594481.cms||---

---||Trichy||Trichy corpn to focus on wards with low vax coverage||Trichy: Trichy Corporation has planned to focus its vaccination drive in areas that are lagging by analysing coverage details in each ward. “We have asked the village panchayats and urban local bodies to share ward-level vaccination coverage in their respective jurisdiction. Using the data, we will approach least covered areas,” said A Subramani, deputy director of health services, Trichy. The health department said that the data furnished by local bodies will indicate if a person is lying about their vaccination status. Trichy district has so far vaccinated 69% of its eligible population with at least one dose. Officials said that a meeting will be held between stakeholders to prepare the vaccination coverage data.Trichy was placed bottom among districts in the state-level vaccination performance in the first week of November. In the vaccination camps held at 135 locations in the district, only 7,494 people were vaccinated. Health officials said that the festive weekend and intermittent rains were the reasons for the low turnout.Trichy’s performance in the vaccination against Covid-19 was rated as poor by health authorities even as it was good in the initial stages. The average turnout at each vaccination centre daily in the state last week was 24, while it was eight in Trichy. The locations for the vaccination drive were also considered as the reason for the poor turnout. Since the corporation has not conducted any study on its coverage to identify most and least covered wards, the camps were held randomly. Medical officers said that even for doorstep programme, people are not properly disclosing their vaccination status.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corpn-to-focus-on-wards-with-low-vax-coverage/articleshow/87594483.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Nagpur||Anti-viral pills welcome, but don’t let guard down against Covid: Docs||Nagpur: Doctors, who had been at the forefront of the fight against Covid, are hopeful of keeping the pandemic under check due to development anti-Covid pills, fall in hospitalization rates and fatalities. At the same time, they are concerned about complacency creeping among the masses and Covid protocols being forgotten. UK has already granted approval to anti-Covid pill molnupiravir, while another pill, Paxlovid, has shown promising results in human trails. Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said that paxlovid, molnupiravir and fluvoxamine are three oral pills to rely on in the future over ivermectin and fabiflu. “All these oral pills need to be administered during the initial period of infection after which they will have least effect,’” he said while pointing at tendency in India to report late and after trying home remedies. Dr Shinde said Paxlovid can be given within five days of the onset of the symptoms while molnupiravir in two-three days. “I have already administered fluvoxamine to outpatients,” he said while also extolling outcomes of the second and third trials of Paxlovid. Physician Dr Jay Deshmukh said molnupiravir is part of a global strategy to eradicate the disease. “The three-pronged strategy of using molnupiravir, vaccinating children above aged five years and starting low-cost self testing is now being contemplated globally,” he said. He welcomed development of experimental drugs that would curtail hospitalization and severity of the disease “but masses should not get complacent and abandon Covid protocols”. Another infectious disease specialist, Dr Ashwini Taywade, said that molnupiravir has a good record of virological control. “Pfizer's drug (Paxlovid) has a Ritonavir component (used as a HIV drug) as a booster for achieving a particular effect. This combination would come with a lot of drug interactions which need to be watched out before administering,” said Tayade who has been engaged by district administration for training the health staffers and government’s medical team. She added that monoclonal antibody (a combination drug) is also giving promising results. “Studies have shown monoclonal antibody therapies have worked well even in vaccinated patients,” said Dr Taywade. Physician Dr Rajesh Atal too termed molnupiravir and Paxlovid as promising drugs. “Paxlovid’s trail data is still smaller in size but it’s a protease inhibitor and stops viral replication. This drug can be a good choice for fully vaccinated patients,” said Dr Atal adding molnupiravir and paxlovid acted action RNA based viruses. The efforts to develop experimental drugs give hope, said physician Dr Sunil Deshpande. “But random clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance are required before one can speak for their efficacy,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/anti-viral-pills-welcome-but-dont-let-guard-down-against-covid-docs/articleshow/87593855.cms||Soumitra Bose

A senior official from the solid waste management department confirmed that the city’s daily garbage collection on November 5 crossed 1,350MT, from 1,150MT on the day before Diwali, almost 200MT more than the usual per day average. On Friday afternoon, by the time lorries had offloaded waste collected from various parts of the city at Bhandewadi, the reading at the weighbridge was 1,350MT. Despite this, around 30% waste remained to be removed from streets across 10 zones. Sources engaged in managing the city’s sanitation works for Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) said the city generates approximately 1,150 MT garbage per day. Last year, due to Covid-19 restrictions , many citizens refrained from bursting firecrackers. This year it was exactly the opposite. The use of firecrackers increased this year and even the number of cracker shops had gone up. Against 582 shops set up across the city in 2020, this year NMC’s fire department issued as many 665 no objection certificates for firecracker shops in the city. Environment activist and founder of Green Vigil Foundation Kaustav Chatterjee said, “We always talk about air and noise pollution due to bursting of fire crackers but solid waste generation due to bursting of crackers also has significant adverse effect on environment.” “Huge amount of solid waste generated adds to additional load on street cleaners. Citizens prefer to burst crackers on streets instead of inside their own premises to avoid the cleaning activity required afterwards,” he said. Solid waste thus generated is collected by municipal waste collectors and dumped at Bhandewadi along with routine municipal waste. The solid waste thus generated contains many unburnt crackers, which might ignite at Bhandewadi causing fires, as huge amount of dry solid waste already exists at Bhandewadi, and bio-composting leads to formation of methane gas, he pointed out. According to a solid waste management department official, the sanitation department ensured that pickup trucks made more trips than usual to transport waste from across the city. Sources pointed out all the waste generated on Diwali day could not be removed because of shortage of sanitary workers. At many places, especially in Gandhibagh, Itwari, Lalganj, Jaripatka etc sanitary workers worked extra time to clear the streets due to waste generated by bursting firecrackers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-generates-200mt-more-waste-per-day-during-diwali/articleshow/87593850.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

However, the district collector added that encroachments in the suburban areas and waterbodies have caused the hardships and inundation in the city.“Although we desilted the waterbodies, encroachments are there. As a permanent solution, we will evict the encroachments on canals after draining the water. Public need not panic as there is no threat of flooding due to rainfall,” the district collector said. He added that Cauvery water was diverted to Kollidam at Mukkombu so that the Cauvery river will not be overburdened. As there is moderate rainfall in the delta districts, discharging water into Cauvery may further create an unsafe environment in the delta districts, he said. “Discharging water into Kollidam will also augment the groundwater table,” the collector said. Officials said that the Mettur dam could be opened on Tuesday and the released water may reach Trichy district on Wednesday. There is also a separate inflow from the Bhavani, Amravati and Noyyal rivers to the Cauvery. The district collector also said that nine water tanks in Thuraiyur have reached full capacity due to substantial rain after a period of 20 years. PWD officials are overseeing water levels in all the rivers, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/no-flood-threats-to-trichy-encroachments-cause-inundation-collector/articleshow/87594484.cms||---

In some areas, the samba transplantation work has also been affected, farmers said.Salem district collector S Karmegam on Monday said that Stanley reservoir in Mettur will likely reach its full capacity (120ft) by Tuesday. The water level in the dam, on Monday, stood at 118ft. Samba paddy crops transplanted in most parts of Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam, Mayiladuthurai, Pudukottai and Trichy districts have been affected due to the incessant rain. Agriculture fields with standing crops have been inundated in several areas in the districts and farmers have been draining rainwater from the fields. So far, samba paddy has been transplanted in around 2 lakh acres in Thanjavur district. Moreover, farmers have raised paddy nurseries to transplant 1 lakh acres in the district. Now, the rain poses a threat to the standing samba and nurseries, farmers said. District collector Dinesh Ponraj Oliver said that 640 waterbodies including lakes in the district have attained their full capacity. Officials have identified 195 spots that are vulnerable to breaching, the collector said. “To face any such eventualities, 45,145 sandbags are made available. Regional level monitoring officials were asked to have a constant vigil,” the collector said. As major parts of Tiruvarur district is a drainage basin, rivers such as the Maraika Koraiyaru, Pamini, Kanthaparitcha and Koraiyaru carry rainwater leading to inundation of several thousands of paddy crop in the district, district secretary of Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam affiliated to CPI P S Masilamani said. “Crops in around 50,000 acres have been affected by the rain in the district. Once the rain is over, proper enumeration should be made to provide required compensation to farmers,” he said. Due to bad weather and high tides, around 3,000 farmers did not venture into the sea on Monday in Nagapattinam district. District collector Arun Thamburaj has asked fishermen not to venture into the sea for two days from Tuesday. He has also asked fishermen who had already left for catching to return to shore immediately.Karur district collector T Prabhushankar inspected a check dam constructed across the Amaravathi river. As the river is swollen, the collector instructed the officials to move people residing along the river to safer places. The collector also inspected Vadacheri tank near Thogamalai in the district. According to farmers, the 400-acre tank has attained its full capacity after 16 years. He also visited Balasamudram in Thogamalai union where rainwater inundated several houses. He instructed the officials to move the affected people to shelters.

---||Nagpur||Sanitizer fumes, oxygenated ambience, 24/7 electrical gadgets make ICUs unsafe||Nagpur: The recent fire at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of an Ahmednagar hospital brought back memories of the horror at Bhandara district hospital, which claimed 10 babies earlier this year. It also reignited the debate around vulnerability of these crucial units and raised questions about fire safety in ICUs. Divisional commissioner Prajakta Lavangare-Verma held a fire audit and electrical review meeting on Tuesday with collectors and district health officials. “We are periodically taking reviews with electrical department regarding safety audits at hospitals. Their inspectors physically inspect premises before reporting the status,” she said, adding budget remains a challenge many times. Nagpur Municipal Corporation chief fire officer Rajendra Uchake said fire safety in ICUs has multiple compromising factors. “The exhaustive use of sanitizers inside ICUs leaves fumes accumulated near the ceiling. Then, ICUs are fully air-conditioned round the clock. There are multiple electrical gadgets and wires criss-crossing each other,” said Uchake, who has vast experience in managing fires. “The ambience inside the ICU is oxygen-enriched due to the continuous supply of oxygen here. Sanitizer fumes make the situation conducive for fires at the slightest spark. Electrical gadgets are functioning round-the-clock, which also raises internal temperature of the wiring and these materials also radiate heat,” said the experienced fire officer. Uchake said fatalities are also high as almost everyone is on life support and cannot move on their own. “It becomes difficult to shift patients on life support. They get asphyxia due to generation of smoke, other gases and abrupt disruption in oxygen supply,” he said. Uchake said measures are being taken to train hospital staffers in fire fighting skills. “We have converted nine fire tender offices into classrooms with smart TV, where free-of-cost training is imparted to hospital staffers. One hospital staffer is also designated ‘nodal fire officer’ and is fully trained to control fires. These officers ensure mock fire drills are conducted periodically at each private hospital,” he said. NMC medical health officer Sanjay Chilkar said hospitals like Pachpaoli Sutika Gruha, Isolation Hospital, and Indira Gandhi Rugnalaya have updated fire fighting systems. “We have been serving notices to hospitals to comply with fire safety norms before issuing them registration numbers,” he said. District health officer Dr Deepak Selokar said fire safety equipment has been installed at 51 Primary Health Centres after a private security agency was allotted the fire and electrical safety audit work. According to a source at civil surgeon office, mock drills are conducted and fire safety measures have been implemented at 12 rural hospitals and two district hospitals at Kamptee and Ramtek. Dr Anup Marar, convenor of Vidarbha Hospitals Association, said any fire incident is an unfortunate accident. “VHA members have been repeatedly sensitised by fire authorities about the 3 Ps of fire safety i.e. Prevent, Plan and Practise. All equipment to prevent fire like installing and maintaining smoke suppression or detection systems, fire extinguishers and using flame retardant materials in interiors are essential,” he said. “Likewise, having a clear fire exit in case of any eventuality, educating staff about fire control and exit plan, accessibility for fire fighters and conducting regular drills matters a lot,” he said. “Since most private hospitals are now NABH accredited, all are expected to comply with laid down guidelines. During second wave, most hospitals also voluntarily undertook fire and electrical audits as guided by the authorities,” said Dr Marar. HC rejects bail pleas of Bhandara hosp nurses Two nurses of Bhandara general hospital, where a fire incident had claimed lives of 10 babies in January, had approached Nagpur bench of Bombay high court challenging the sessions court order rejecting their bail plea. The high court has also rejected their bail pleas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sanitizer-fumes-oxygenated-ambience-24/7-electrical-gadgets-make-icus-unsafe/articleshow/87593866.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Hyderabad||T has grown sans Centre’s support: KTR||Hyderabad: Coming down heavily on the Centre, Telangana IT and industries minister KT Rama Rao on Monday accused the Union government of meting out step motherly treatment towards the state and said it has not sanctioned any economic or educational project of national importance to the state since its formation. Pointing out that the youngest state has grown well despite the lack of support from the Centre, he said the recent RBI report stated that Telangana is the 11th largest state in terms of geographical area and 12th largest in terms of population but is the fourth largest contributor to the national economy. “If the government of India is serious that we grow as a nation, if they are serious about the self-reliant India campaign and the ‘Make in India’ campaign, they have to encourage states like Telangana, which continues to be progressive and punch above its weight…,” Rao said while addressing participants at the CII’s conference on Manufacturing Excellence’, Man’Exe–2021. KTR pointed out that repeated requests for sanction of industrial corridors between Hyderabad and Bengaluru, Hyderabad-Nagpur, Hyderabad-Warangal and Hyderabad-Vijayawada have fallen on deaf ears. Even requests for educational institutions such as IIM, NID, Tribal University and IIIT at Nizamabad have not been granted by the Centre and projects such as ITIR have been scrapped without any contingency plan. “When united Andhra Pradesh was divided into Telangana and AP, there was a clear promise made on the floor of the Parliament that all the industries in the newly formed states will be given special incentives to promote industrialisation and more employment but it's been seven and half years, again zero delivery,” he added. The minister also stated that the Centre must lend genuine support to MSMEs and move beyond the ‘Atmanirbhar’ package. “We feel the packages that have been declared have not had the desired impact on MSMEs and even the production linked incentive scheme that was launched as part of the Atmanirbhar package is not pragmatic,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-has-grown-sans-centres-support-ktr/articleshow/87593865.cms||---

Following a hearing that included several allegations of overbilling, the commission also helped settle a billing issue between the patient family and the KPC Medical College.In the KPC case, an elderly woman from Regent Park had been admitted for Covid treatment. Even as the patient was entitled to a coverage under the West Bengal Health scheme, the hospital treated her in a cabin due to bed crisis, which escalated the hospital bill. “While about Rs 1 lakh was sanctioned under the health scheme, around Rs 80,000 was still due. We have told the patient party and hospital to spilt this amount into half,” said WBCERC chairperson Ashim Kumar Banerjee. The other hospitals who were told to refund treatment cost included Arogya Nursing Home, Microlab Nursing Home, Nehru Memorial Dama Hospital, Seva Hospital, Baksi Orthopaedics and We Care Nursing Home, Bally. The panel has asked these hospitals to refund between Rs 20,000 and Rs 1 lakh in its judgment after it completed hearing of these cases.

The MLA blamed the Uttarakhand government for "step-motherly treatment of his constituency" and did not give enough relief to the disaster-affected people. The roads - Madkot-Munsyari, Thal-Munsyari, Bona-Tomik, Darma-Chaudas - were badly damaged, Dhami said, adding that owing to bad road conditions, many tourists have cancelled their bookings. Bona and Tomik villagers produce cash crops such as potatoes which were badly hit, he added. "The Chaudas and Darma valleys are still cut off. No steps have been taken by the local administration and the state government. Also, the Dharchula constituency is situated along the China and Nepal border and villagers often face network connectivity issues," he claimed. The fast will continue till our demands are met, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/dharchula-mla-starts-fast-unto-death/articleshow/87593132.cms||Prem Punetha

Although the visit has raised eyebrows, both said it was a courtesy visit to meet Anand’s ailing mother and former MLC Shubhalata Asnotikar. Anand Asnotikar was an MLA and minister in the BJP government in 2008-13. He quit the party because of his enmity with Hegde. Anand was in BJP till 2018 but Hegde reportedly opposed giving the former a BJP ticket for the assembly election. Later the BJP ticket was given to Roopali Naik. Asnotikar joined JDS at last moment and came second pushing then sitting Congress MLA Satish Sail to third position. Roopali Naik had defeated Asnotikar by a margin of 17,000 votes. There after Asnotikar turned into one of the big critics of Hegde. During the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Asnotikar had declared that he would avenge his defeat by trouncing Hegde. He contested as a Congress-backed JD(S) candidate from Uttara Kannada but lost by a margin of a whopping 4.5 lakhs votes, which was the highest margin in the state. The animosity between the two continued as Asnotikar once said he was waiting for Anant Kumar Hegde to die. He later retracted his statement and apologized by saying it was slip of tongue. He kept on criticizing Hegde at every opportunity. But the MP’s sudden visit to Asnotikar’s house under the pretext of meeting Shubhalata has led to speculation among BJP workers that Hegde, who is now on not so good terms with MLA Roopali Naik, is trying for a different political equation during the next assembly polls. Though Roopali Naik had accompanied Hegde to Asnotikar’s house on Monday, she kept mum all through the meeting. The meeting however has sent ripples in BJP circles with the prediction that Asnotikar will rejoin BJP soon.

---||Kolkata||Dwaipayan hospital fraud||Dwaipayan.Ghosh Kolkata: A new fraud - using the old modus operandi - has hit the city with both the city police and CID now receiving complaintrs from within the city and its surrroundings claiming that cyber crooks were siphoning off money in the name of confirming doctors' appointments in a few reputed hospital chains or their allied clinics or even stand alone clinics. "In most cases, the victim were found to have checked the internet and come some a contact number of the clinic or hospital visited by the doctor whose appointment he or she wanted to sought. When the victims called, they were either asked to call back later or they did not receive a response at all," an officer said. Sometime later though, they would receive a call where the caller would ask the victim if he/she wanted a confirmed appointment. If the victims agreed, they would be asked to download a software and pay a nominal amount for booking. The caller would promise to guide the victims throughout the booking. Within minutes, after the victim acted according to the caller's bidding believing the accused blindly, he or she ended up losing money," explained an officer from detective department. "This is a crime that has seen a huge rise ever since lockdown began. "The fraudsters are now also using display advertisements on such networking sites as Facebook and Instagram in the name of some of the finest hospital chains in Kolkata and announcing that you can get discounts. Once the victim is convinced about clicking or responsing to these advertisements, several google forms appear where the victim is asked to place orders and make payments. Multiple cases have been reported this festive season. Fortunately, the losses have not exceeded a few thousand," said an investigating officer. BOX: * Verify the legitimacy of the site and contact numbers * OTPs are like your bank locker keys, do not share them * Think twice before clicking on email links * Be wary of any unbelievable discounts offered while making your bookings * Do not pay if you find something grossly unfamiliar in the manner your application for a doctor's appointment is being treated||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dwaipayan-hospital-fraud/articleshow/87593163.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Chandigarh||Lahaul valley gets power supply through Atal tunnel||Manali: Nearly 8,000 houses of Lahaul valley of Himachal Pradesh will continue to get power even after annual snowfall in winter season this year as the valley’s power grids are now being fed through a 33 kV transmission line laid across the Atal tunnel. After year-long efforts, the laying of power transmission lines from Palchan near Manali to Lahaul valley through Atal tunnel has been completed. After a series of tests, the power supply to the coldest region of Himachal was started through the tunnel on Sunday. The 33/11 kV substations at Sissu, Karga and Thirot have been connected with the new transmission line. Earlier, a transmission line across 13,050-foot-high Rohtang pass was the only electricity supply link to Lahaul. Heavy snowfall on the pass used to snap the cables frequently in winter season. The area being unreachable in the winter season, Lahaul valley used to stay plunged in darkness for weeks or even months. The 4.5 MW Thirot hydroelectric project becomes the only source of electricity in winter season. Due to less power discharge as water froze over, the project was not able to fulfil the required needs of the area. Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board Ltd (HPSEBL) executive engineer at Keylong Vikram Rana said, “We have laid 10-km-long cross linked polyethylene (XLPE) cable from Dhundi at south portal of Atal tunnel to the north portal of the tunnel. The old transmission lines across Rohtang pass will also be kept on standby mode and will be used occasionally,” he said. Engineers of HPSEBL, Border Roads Organisation and contractors were testing the new transmission lines for last 15 days. After everything was fixed, all the power load of Lahaul valley was shifted to the newly laid transmission line. Rana said about 8,000 consumers of Keylong electrical division will get a reliable power supply round the year. “Earlier, it used to take months to restore the 33kV grid supply in case of any breakdown at Rohtang pass in winter. An alternate source of power shall also be available to the Atal tunnel. Maintenance of this line will be easier than cables across the high pass.” Winter is the time when people in Lahaul need uninterrupted power the most. Covered with blanket of snow, with most roads blocked, people spend time mostly indoors. Modes of entertainment remain non-operational in absence of power. Many people now have power storage devices but these drain after few days and solar power systems do not work in absence of sun. Many people would not have battery in phones and people do not trust electricity heating appliances. Even the government offices have LPG heaters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/lahaul-valley-gets-power-supply-through-atal-tunnel/articleshow/87593868.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Kashiff had invited me to cruise party, confirms min||Mumbai: Guardian minister for Mumbai city and state fisheries minister Aslam Shaikh on Monday confirmed that Kashiff Khan, managing director of Fashion TV India, had invited him for the “rave party” on the cruise ship on October 2, but he did not accept the invitation. NCP minister Nawab Malik had on Sunday alleged that “international drug mafia” Khan was making all possible efforts to implicate Shaikh and the children of a few MVA cabinet ministers in the October 2 cruise ship raid led by Mumbai NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede. “Before mentioning Shaikh’s name, I had personally spoken to him and only after his consent, disclosed his name to the media,” Malik said. Shaikh on Monday said: “I do not know this Kashiff Khan. Being a guardian minister for Mumbai city, several people invite me for events ...It appears that at one of the events, Khan extended me the invitation [for cruise ship party]. It was my first meeting with him; I never phoned him. Since I had decided not to attend Khan’s event, I did not take his further details.” Shaikh claimed the entire episode is an attempt to divert attention from key issues and destabilize the democratically elected MVA government. “Aryan Khan’s case has been blown out of proportion...Neither was he in possession of drugs nor had he consumed them...he should have been sent to a rehabilitation centre, instead he was sent to jail...his life has been ruined as he has been labelled a drug peddler,” he said. The minister also raised questions over the “complete silence” on the seizure of drugs worth Rs 30,000 crore at Mundra port in Gujarat in September. “After initial reports, the central investigating agencies have maintained a discreet silence over the biggest-ever drug seizure. I am surprised and shocked.” Shaikh further said that it is unfortunate that the BJP has politicized major issues in the state, making all out efforts to defame and destabilize the MVA government. Claiming that actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case was hyped for obvious political reasons, he said: “Massive publicity was given to the suicide case. Then there were all-egations that it was a murder. The case was later entrusted to the CBI even as BJP was on the forefront launching a fr-ontal attack on the MVA gove-rnment. But after the Bihar elections, the BJP is completely silent on the case.” He added: “When two agencies are probing into the cruise ship case, why is BJP making uncalled-for comments, it is not the spokesperson of central agencies.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/kashiff-had-invited-me-to-cruise-party-confirms-min/articleshow/87593887.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Modi recites abhangs to praise Warkari movement||Kolhapur: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday recited abhangs (peotic phrases) of Sant Dnyaneshwar and Sant Tukaram — the 13th and 17th century saints who left a mark on the Warkari movement — during the foundation stone laying event for the four-lanning of the routes taken by the palanquins of both the saints to reach the temple town of Pandharpur. Participating in the event virtually, Modi recited Sant Tukaram’s famous abhang “Vishnumay Jaga, Vaishnavancha Dharma, Bhedabhed Bhrama Amangala” that roughly translates to: “In this world of devotion towards Lord Vishnu, and people following Vaishanava thought, it is a curse to practise discrimination.” “In the Wari, no one discriminates. The warkaris refer to each other as ‘mauli’, meaning mother. The woman warkaris match steps with the men. The Warkari movement is one of it’s kind. The warkaris arrive from different places, taking different routes, but their aim is one — to express their devotion for Vitthal,” he said. Modi sought three pledges from people during his address. First, is to plant trees along the palkhi marg (palanquin routes). Second, to install clean drinking water facilities for the warkaris. “The third pledge I want is from the people of Pandharpur town. They should make the town the cleanest pilgrimage site in the country,” said Modi. Union road minister Nitin Gadkari, who was present for the event at Pandharpur, said: “The work on some sections has already started. We have also included the widening of the 8-km Wakri to Pandharpur stretch to the project. I am hopeful that the work will be completed in a year.” Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who participated virtually, assured that the state government will extend all help. Thackeray recalled his experience of participating in the Wari a few years ago. “The Wari has withstood not just heat, wind and rain, but also several attacks over the centuries. The state government will extend all support to complete the work,” he said. The ‘Palkhi Marg’, which have been given National Highway status, will have dedicated lanes for the warkaris to walk. Modi inaugurated the project to upgrade of the highways connecting the temple town by spending Rs 1,180 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/modi-recites-abhangs-to-praise-warkari-movement/articleshow/87593867.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Lawns, banquet bookings see upward surge||Nagpur: As vaccinations rise and people slowly come out of the fear of Covid-19, there has been a positive impact on businesses revolving around wedding celebrations. The worst-hit sector during lockdown is now the biggest beneficiary, including lawns, hotels and banquet halls, specifically those situated outside city limits. The next two months are heavily booked for many, and on some days they are struggling to gather enough staff to cater to these guests. Vinod Kanakdande, secretary of Nagpur Halls and Lawns Association, said, “No doubt bookings have increased. Compared to the extremely tough financial condition we all went through in the last one-and-a-half years, this is really good news. Of course, the limit of guests is there, but with more parties being held the business is now stable.” A banquet hall owner outside city limits said, “There are two type of service providers in this sector. One is purely renting of premises for lunch or dinner, and the ceremony itself. While others provide a full package of rooms for guests, followed by all meals and dedicated place for ceremonies. Majority of those in our business now fall into the second category, as the client would like to avail option of rooms for outstation guests.” So now businesses are able to tap both sources of revenue, catering for the wedding plus the room tariff. “Earlier, due to Covid-19, room stay was not being preferred. Also, outstation guests were not coming, which meant only five-odd rooms were booked for one night as emergency back up. Now, we have at least 20 or more rooms being booked by default,” said a banquet hall owner. Slowly, but surely, these businesses are now nearing full capacity. “Bookings have really hit the upward curve since October. We have people confirming their November and December bookings with advance deposits coming in. I think it is probably because cases are at all-time low and nobody wants to risk and wait for later, when the third wave may come,” said another banquet owner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/lawns-banquet-bookings-see-upward-surge/articleshow/87593878.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Ranchi||Ranchi: Three Maoists, part of several anti-cop activities, surrender||RANCHI: Three members of a squad led by CPI (Maoist) Central Committee Member Anal Da alias Patiram Manjhi surrendered before the state police in a function held at the Ranchi deputy inspector general’s office on Monday. Those who surrendered include area commander Bailoon Sardar, Gaju alias Suraj Sardar and his wife Raimuni alias Geeta. Bailoon is accused in 12 cases, Suraj in nine and Raimuni in seven cases which are registered at different police stations under various acts, including Arms act, Unlawful Activities Prevention act and the Criminal Law Amendment act. They are also accused in cases related to murder. Anal Da’s squad is active on the junctions of Ranchi, West Singhbhum, Seraikela and Khunti districts and it has indulged in several acts of violence. The squad was responsible for an improvised explosive device (IED) explosion at the BJP office under Kharsawan police station on May 3, 2019 just before the Lok Sabha election. The group had also targeted the cops in Kharsawan police station with an IED on May 19, 2019 which injured two police officials. It had also triggered an IED explosion on May 28, 2019 under Kuchai police station which injured 15 cops. The squad had murdered five cops under Tiruldih police station on June 14, 2019 and stolen their weapons. Speaking to media persons, Bailoon said, “Around 45 to 50 persons armed with modern weapons, including self-loading rifle, move with Anal Da now but the influence of the squad has declined in the past few years.” Asked what prompted him to surrender, Bailoon said, “Besides deviating from its core principles, the Maoists are recruiting girls now to exploit them. Under such circumstances, when the police approached my family members for my surrender I gave it a serious thought. The entire matter was kept under wraps from other squad members.” Suraj and Raimuni alleged that they were exploited in various ways in the squad, including non-payment of salary. Describing the surrender as an important milestone, inspector general (Operations) Amol Homkar said it would help in gathering information about other extremists. “Police would also try to get details of the major acts of violence committed by the Anal Da squad,” he added. He further said, “Police had mounted pressure on the extremists and we confiscated Bailoon’s property. He had sought financial help from his squad but they denied. The extremists were also disenchanted with the Maoists as the latter is solely engaged in extortion.” Homkar added that Jharkhand police have adopted a multi-pronged approach against the extremists, including massive awareness programmes, for their surrender.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/three-maoists-part-of-several-anti-cop-activities-surrender/articleshow/87592653.cms||---

From limiting guests during celebrations to choosing nearest ghats to cut down on travel expenses, devotees are trying every trick in the book to keep the budget in check. TOI spoke to various devotees and they said that common people were already suffering because of high fuel prices and the increased prices of essentials from edible oil to fruits and vegetables are adding to their woes. Akash Gupta, a resident of Lajpat Nagar, said they used to invite more than 200 people for kheer bhojan but this year they have decided to keep the celebrations low key and are going to celebrate only with family. “As it is we are struggling with the expenses and an extended guest list will only make matters worse. Generally we spend around Rs 10,000 on Chhath Puja but this time I think the budget has already crossed Rs 13,000,” said Gupta. Divyanshu, a resident of Bariatu, said he has been celebrating Chhath Puja in his society for more than six years now as people used to contribute for the arrangements like construction of an artificial pond and makeshift tents for devotees. But this year people didn’t come forward. “I will be going to Joda Talaab with my family as we cannot afford to spend so much on the arrangements now,” he said. TOI also visited Ranchi Chhath Puja market at Ranchi Zila School campus to take stock of the prices of essentials used during Chhath Puja. From veggies to bamboo products used in festivities, the prices have risen to the tune of around 20-30%. Fruits like banana which cost Rs 50 per dozen last year is being sold for Rs 80 per dozen while oranges saw a Rs 30 rise per kg from Rs 60 per kg last year. Apart from these, a coconut which cost Rs 30 last year, now costs Rs 60. While guavas now cost Rs 100 a kg, up from Rs 70 last year, a carton of apples which was sold for Rs 400 last year, now costs Rs 750.

JPDA spokesperson Pramod Kumar said, “We are appealing to the ruling parties of Congress and JMM to reduce the state VAT on petrol and diesel. During the meeting today, we explained to the JMM office-bearers on how cuts will, in fact, help the state earn more revenue in terms of increased sales. Due to the high price, many inter-state travellers and transporters are buying fuel from the neighbouring states where prices are low.” This demand comes a day after Congress-ruled Punjab cut Rs 10 and Rs 5 on petrol and diesel, respectively, from its VAT share ahead of the state assembly polls. Last week, the Centre had cut petrol and oil prices. Neither JMM nor Congress has spoken of slashing the rates yet. Talking to TOI, state Congress president Rajesh Thakur, while taking a dig at Centre, said, “By slashing the rates, the Modi government has in a sense acknowledged that they were on an uncontrolled price hike spree even though it has been denying it all this while. They must give further relief to people and as far as the state government is concerned, it will take an appropriate decision after evaluating the situation soon.” In Jharkhand, Rs 17 is charged on petrol and Rs 12.50 on diesel as state VAT. A few leaders in the state Congress unit preferring anonymity said that they are facing pressure from the public for rate cuts. “Even as the recent cut on fuel prices fuel prices by the NDA government at the Centre was solely motivated by political compulsions keeping the upcoming elections in mind, the public doesn’t want to analyse all these. They are now demanding that when the Centre and other states can reduce their taxes, why can’t Jharkhand do the same,” a senior party worker said. “The petrol dealers and the business community, too, are pressing for the same, citing that the finance portfolio in Jharkhand is with Congress. The latest cut by Punjab has put pressure on Congress here,” another party office-bearer said. Former state Congress president Rameshwar Oraon is the state finance minister at the moment. Meanwhile, opposition BJP has announced to hit the streets in a few days’ time for VAT cut on fuel. Talking to reporters at the party office here on Monday, state BJP president Deepak Prakash said, “The party has decided to stage demonstrations across the state against the anti-people government here to demand cuts in petrol and diesel prices. We will announce our roadmap soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jmm-cong-urged-to-slash-vat-on-fuel/articleshow/87592738.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

As many as five dens in Sarnadeeh under Mahuadanr range in Palamu Tiger Reserve (PTR) are lying abandoned with no breeding taking place this year. “The wolves don’t breed in Sarnadeeh anymore. Boys from the nearby village and shepherds disturb the wolves by throwing fireballs at their dens, thereby disrupting the privacy that the wolves need for breeding,” Mahuadanr ranger Brinda Pandey said. There are around 80 wolves in Mahuadanr range and they breed in November. The wolves are now breeding in Lodh, Tewahi and Mirgi which are safer and away from human interference, sources said. Kumar Ashutosh, field director and chief conservator of forest at PTR, said, “We are planning to install trap cameras in and around the dens of the wolves. Right now, we have shortage of trap cameras as these are installed in the tiger reserve. So I have placed a requisition for 100 trap cameras.” Wildlife expert D S Srivastav has urged the PTR authorities to save the wolf sanctuary from being encroached upon as land mafia is hyper-active in the region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/human-intervention-force-wolves-to-abandon-den-in-their-lone-sanctuary/articleshow/87593046.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Patna cops picked up J’khand advocate, HC likely to hear case today||Ranchi: Patna Police has picked up Jharkhand high court advocate and additional public prosecutor, Rajneesh Vardhan, on Sunday after thrashing him, following which his family members have filed a habeas corpus before the high court on Monday. The court is likely to hear the petition on Tuesday despite being a holiday for Chhath. According to Vardhan’s wife, Sweta Priyadarshini, a team of Patna Police came to their house at Sukhdeonagar here on Sunday around 10.30pm and thrashed him. They also picked him up without giving any reason. Soon after, Sweta informed the Advocates’ Association, the high court and sent emails to the offices of Jharkhand DGP and Ranchi SSP, seeking the whereabouts of her husband. After receiving the news, the Advocates’ Association swung into action and helped file a habeas corpus before the high court. The association’s secretary, Navin Kumar, said they have prayed to the high court to hear the matter urgently as the action is a gross violation of fundamental rights and concerns the liberty of an individual. Kumar also informed that Vardhan has been an advocate since 2003 and is staying with his wife and daughter. Since the Patna Police team was accompanied by personnel of the Sukhdeonagar police station, Kumar stressed that the top brass of Jharkhand police must have information about the matter as they have been allowed to pick up Vardhan without following proper protocol in inter-state arrests. Highlighting the norms laid down by the Supreme Court in several cases, Kumar said the police ought to have produced Vardhan before a magistrate. In the petition filed by Priyadarshini, a copy of which is with the TOI, she said one of the policemen told her that Vardhan is being taken to Patna. Despite requests being made by her husband to show a warrant of arrest or an order for a transit remand, the policemen assaulted him and forced him into their vehicle, the petition said. Condemning the action, Jharkhand State Bar Council member Hemant Kumar Shikarwar said that it is highly deprecable that an advocate has been taken away by force without providing any information for picking him up. The high handedness of the police needs to be checked, Shikarwar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/patna-cops-picked-up-jkhand-advocate-hc-likely-to-hear-case-today/articleshow/87593063.cms||---

The minister’s statement came after he conducted a meeting with senior government officials on the matter. Mahto said that all the other issues raised by the para-teachers would be resolved through discussion. Mahto said that the government would try to finalise the rules and make an announcement in this regard on December 29, which marks the second anniversary of the state government. “The government will hand over a draft of the rules to the representatives of para-teachers and hold a discussion with them after Chhath Puja. The para-teachers here have objected to one clause in the Bihar model which states that the services of those who fail the assessment test will be terminated. We will resolve this issue through discussion,” he said. As per the Bihar model, the trained para-teachers allegedly get a salary ranging from Rs 5,200 to Rs 20,200 per month with provision for provident fund and annual increment and the untrained teachers get around Rs 17,000. In Jharkhand, the para-teachers get between Rs 12,000 and Rs 15,000 per month. There are around 65,000 para-teachers working in different schools across the state and they have been demanding for their regularisation, among other things, since 2004. Meanwhile, the para-teachers have planned to gather in Ranchi from all over the state on November 14, a day before the statehood day, to press for their regularisation and their wages. One of their representatives, Sanjay Dubey, said, “We are awaiting the government’s intimation after today’s meeting. If we do not get any response from them, our plan of action would be announced on November 13.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/announcement-on-para-teachers-by-dec-29-edu-min/articleshow/87593104.cms||Sanjay Sahay

According to the audited reports for the financial year 2018-19, the discom incurred a loss of Rs 212.17 crore. The main role of the PSU is to procure power from generators and distribute it to the consumers and collect the tariff from them on a rate decided by the state electricity regulatory commission. As the PSU has been purchasing power at a very high cost and distributing it to the consumers at a subsidised rate, the difference has become financial burden for the PSU. If the power is purchased at cheaper rate, the losses will reduce, which is otherwise piling up every year. The PSU is now eying solar power as a cheaper alternative. Director (operations) JBVNL, KK Verma, said there are around 45 lakh power consumers getting power supply from the JBVNL in the state. “Of these 45 lakh consumers, around 36 lakh are in the rural areas, power supply to whom is highly subsidised by the state. The government gives high priority to the rural consumers and those in economically weaker section,” he said. Irrespective of the amount that consumers pay as electricity bill, JBVNL has to purchase power at a rate of around Rs 4.75 per unit from the power generators. This rate often goes up on days when the power drawal is more than a fixed limit. Verma said of the 2,000MW daily requirement of power in the state, 35%-40% of the electricity is consumed by those 35 lakh consumers who enjoy subsidy. Hardly 10%-15% of them pay the bills. “The state government has launched one-time settlement scheme to encourage consumers to clear their over dues by December 15, 2021. The government is going to write off interests on pending power bills of net worth Rs 1,700 crore if the consumers pay their outstanding bills,” he said, adding that once the dues are cleared, switching to a cheaper power sources was a viable option.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/reeling-under-losses-psu-eyes-green-power-as-bailout/articleshow/87592667.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

While the case has been filed on March 18, 2008, the next hearing of the case is on March 18, 2022,” Malik tweeted on Monday. According to court records uploaded on the official website, a case was registered under Sections 3,4,5 and 8 of the NDPS Act. “This appears to be a typographical error. It is a case of PITA provisions, and our records reflect the same. Our team is taking the matter up with the court authorities,” Gupta said. The Pune police on Monday issued a statement, saying the then social security inspector Rajendra Bhamre and his team had raided a room in a plush star hotel in Bund Garden area and arrested Harshada and two others on October 13, 2007 under the provisions of PITA. A chargesheet was filed on January 14, 2008 against the three accused, and since then, the matter has been pending before the court. Wankhede’s wife Kranti Redkar tweeted on Monday, saying her sister will tackle Malik’s tweet legally and that her husband has no relation whatever with the case. “I know the media has a lot of questions on Malik’s tweet. I would like to say that my sister was and continues to be victim in this case. According to our legal team, it is not prudent to comment on the matter since it is subjudice,” she tweeted. According to reports, Wankhede too reacted sharply to Malik’s tweet. “I was not even in service when the incident took place in Pune. I got married to Kranti in 2017. Then how am I associated with the case in any way?” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/malik-raises-wankhede-sis-in-laws-drug-case-cops-clarify/articleshow/87595231.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Only fully vaccinated can visit govt offices, travel in Aapli Bus: NMC||Nagpur: From Tuesday, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) will allow entry to government offices to only those people who have taken both the doses of Covid vaccine. Under the Break the Chain guidelines, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B on Monday issued a new order making two doses mandatory for employees working at various establishments and citizens visiting the government offices. Employees at educational institutions like schools, colleges, coaching classes, training institutes etc will be required to complete two doses of vaccine. Similarly, double vaccination is mandatory for 18+ citizens travelling by Aapli bus, autorickshaws or any other mode of public transport. “In some places at least one dose is required. This order will come into effect from November 9. NMC will conduct random inspections at all places. There will be punitive action if irregularities are found,” Radhakrishnan said. As per the NMC order, the management and staff working at religious places and citizens entering such places should have completed two doses of vaccine. “Vaccination certificate and photo identity card will be required to be displayed at the entrance. Citizens participating in social events, meetings, conventions, religious processions and festivals will also need to complete two doses and must carry vaccination certificates,” the civic chief stated in a press communique. Government, semi-government and private offices, employees working in similar organizations, officers, all visitors above the age of 18 visiting such places will need to have two or at least the first dose of Covid vaccine. At least one dose is mandatory for all citizens above 18 years and people visiting parks, libraries, study rooms, marriage halls, lawns and public places. Owners and employees in markets and shops must also have completed both the doses. For hawkers, the NMC has asked for at least one dose. Similar conditions will be applicable for workers at construction sites. For those working in government, semi-government and private health institutions, both the doses are mandatory. In all these places, as per the order, it will be necessary to show the vaccination certificate along with the photo identity card. Boys and girls below 18 years will be required to show proper proof of their age.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/only-fully-vaccinated-can-visit-govt-offices-travel-in-aapli-bus-nmc/articleshow/87594029.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Nagpur||Covid-19: Leftover doses used as booster shots at some private centres||NAGPUR: Many fully vaccinated beneficiaries, specially health care workers and frontline workers, are taking the third dose of Covid vaccine at some private vaccination centres, though the government is yet to approve booster dose. Those taking the third dose are relying on the fact that a booster shot has already been approved in the UK and US while it is still under study in India. Some doctors reiterated their demand for the booster dose to make the third dose valid and also prevent vaccine wastage. Local immunization officials confirmed to TOI that many are taking the third jab using leftover doses at private centres. They said these shots are officially recorded as wastage. In the last couple of days, the number of wastage doses indicates they are being used for a third dose. At some centres, it is being repeatedly seen that 20 to 30 more vials are opened than the actual requirement, they said. At some places, just one person is vaccinated while nine doses are shown as wastage. A community medicine professor from a medical college said that the results of Covaxin booster dose study are still awaited. “There are two schools of thought. One feels booster dose is needed after six months. Another says Covid vaccines give immunity for a longer duration. Therefore, the government is yet to formulate any policy on booster dose. Focus is still on completing first and second doses,” he said. The professor said personally he didn’t see any harm from the booster dose. “It will only increase the immunity level,” he said. Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde wondered why the government was delaying approval for the booster dose. “Recently, those tested positive in Kerala were all vaccinated over six months ago. Even if they didn’t get hospitalized, the risk of long Covid and transmission is always there. Booster dose protects from infection and cuts transmission of the virus,” he said. Dr Shinde was of the view that all the fully vaccinated persons among healthcare workers, frontline workers or senior citizens who have completed six months must get the booster dose. He also pointed out that vaccine efficacy against delta has reduced by around 20%. Vidarbha Hospital convener Dr Anup Marar said that many developed countries have started approving third dose for high risk individuals. “Scientifically, many are propagating the booster dose. In India, the authorities may be withholding the same due to the inequity between availability of doses and pending unvaccinated citizens,” he said. Dr Marar feels vaccinated and aware citizens will surely like to get the booster dose. “Looking at the near expiry of vaccine stock with private centres, authorities should contemplate approving the third dose utilizing this stock on payment basis so that underhand booster dose, if any, is avoided and those getting jabbed are officially added to the vaccination data,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/leftover-doses-used-as-booster-shots-at-some-private-centres/articleshow/87594048.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Delhi||'Tampering with evidence': 7-year jail for Ansal brothers||NEW DELHI: Real estate barons Sushil and Gopal Ansal were on Monday sentenced to seven years in jail for tampering with evidence in the 1997 Uphaar fire tragedy that had claimed 59 lives. A city court said the circumstances in which the crime was committed showed the deep disrespect the convicts had for the law, judicial process and victims of the disaster. The court said the case was not related only to the prosecution and Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy (AVUT) but to society as a whole and the sentencing must respond to that. A fine of Rs 2.25 crore was also imposed on each of the Ansal brothers, which would be paid as compensation to the victims after disbursing the cost incurred by the prosecution. Regrets by Uphaar convicts are hollow, aim only to escape punishment: Court No amount of compensation can alleviate the agony, trauma and pain suffered by the family members of the victims, (but) compensation in the form of money can provide some succour to them," said the court. Chief metropolitan magistrate Pankaj Sharma said, "Victims eagerly wait for the outcome of the trial, and any assault that derails it is an injury on their mind as it causes immense mental trauma and pain to them. The foundation of the judiciary is premised on the trust and confidence of people, and any action aimed to thwart it cannot be permitted and is required to be dealt with utmost strictness." Former court staffers Dinesh Chand Sharma, P P Batra and Anoop Singh were also sentenced to imprisonment for seven years and a fine of Rs 3 lakh each imposed on them. The Ansals, along with five others, including the then court staff, had torn, defaced and obliterated crucial documents of the prosecution evidence to secure their acquittal. They had been convicted in the main matter. Uphaar Fire Tragedy: Delhi court awards 7-year jail terms to Ansal brothers and othersAfter pronouncement of the order, all the convicts were taken into custody and the judge said it was one of the longest cases of his judicial career. "It is very hard to reach a decision given the complexities involved, but after thinking over several nights, I have come to this decision that they deserve punishment," said the CMM. The order said when the sentence was to be pronounced, the convicts stated that they had reformed and were remorseful and repentant for whatever they had done and were seeking forgiveness. However, the judge observed that the "regrets offered by the convicts are hollow" and their "aim is to only escape the punishment". The order noted that hampering of the main case affected AVUT's legal and constitutional rights to a fair trial. Though the convicts cited their advanced age and ill health, the court said: "The trial got prolonged due to the delay tactics adopted by them, and obviously, with the passage of time, they will grow old. The plea of leniency on this premise is of no relevance as they entered into a conspiracy to do such a wicked act knowing fully well its consequences," the court said. It added that the convicts couldn't be permitted to take advantage of their own wrong as they indulged in procrastination and now they were playing victim by arguing that they had gone through the ordeal of a long trial and become old and had severe health problems. Delhi State Legal Services Authority had suggested in the Victim Impact Report that the victims had suffered "incalculable harm" and the quantum of compensation was incalculable. The court said an appropriate sentence proportionate to the gravity of the offence and capable of having a deterrent effect on potential offenders was called for. "Misplaced sympathy or unwarranted leniency will send a wrong signal to the public, giving room to suspect institutional integrity," the court added. In the main fire tragedy case, the Ansals had earlier been sentenced to a two-year jail term by Supreme Court. However, they were released taking into account the time in prison already served and on the condition that they paid Rs 30 crore fine each to be used for building a trauma centre. The trial in the main case had seen several twists and turns. On November 20, 2007, all the 12 accused, including Sushil Ansal and Gopal Ansal, were convicted and, on November 23, sentenced to two years' imprisonment. On September 11, 2008, the Ansals were sent to Tihar after SC cancelled their bail. On December 19, Delhi HC upheld the trial court order convicting the Ansal brothers but reduced their sentence from two to one year. AVUT moved SC in 2009, seeking enhancement of the sentence of the brothers. On March 5, 2014, the top court upheld their conviction but the judges differed on their sentence. Justice T S Thakur awarded a one-year jail term while Justice G S Mishra sentenced them to the period undergone. On August 19, 2015, SC allowed them to walk free, asking them to pay a Rs 30-crore fine each. Finally, on February 9, 2017, the SC sent Gopal Ansal to one year in jail but gave relief to Sushil considering his advanced age by giving him the jail term already undergone by him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tampering-with-evidence-7-year-jail-for-ansal-brothers/articleshow/87595282.cms||Usha Das
---||Delhi||Many newly dug ponds in 800 sites for Chhath puja in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Elaborate arrangements have been made for Chhath puja at nearly 800 sites in Delhi, most of them newly dug ponds. Delhi Disaster Management Authority, while allowing the annual festival, had, however, banned any events on the banks of the Yamuna. Hinting at the political importance of the festival, Delhi government has asked district authorities to create artificial water bodies and arrange tents, lights, drinking water and sanitation for the November 10-11 event. After a political wrangle over the initial ban on the festival due to Covid fears, on October 29, DDMA allowed the puja, conducted mostly by people from Bihar and eastern UP, a demographic that has electoral significance. On Monday, Manish Sisodia claimed Delhi government was the only state administration that was organising Chhath puja on such a large scale. Delhi govt deploys civil defence personnel at popular ghats to ensure Covid compliance  Despite all hurdles created by Covid, the Arvind Kejriwal government is celebrating Chhath in a grand manner. Before the Aam Aadmi Party came to power in 2015, the other governments had created barely 80-90 Chhath ghats and only select groups from BJP-Congress got exclusive access to these ghats," alleged Sisodia, continuing the political rhetoric that has marked the 2021 event. The deputy CM added at the press conference that regardless of political affiliation of an individual, he or she was supported by the Kejriwal government in forming a proper Chhath committee to celebrate the festival. He also appealed to the people to practice caution, pointing out that Covid cases may be down, but the pandemic hadn't ended yet. At all the puja sites, crowd control measures will be enforced by the district administration in coordination with the puja committees. Sisodia said the AAP government would provide amenities like tents, microphones, lights and music, sanitation, drinking water and security. The municipal corporations are responsible for sanitation at the puja sites and are working with the Delhi government on comfortable facilities for the lakhs of devotees. "The work is almost done," said Yogesh Verma, chairman, Keshavpuram zone, North Delhi Municipal Corporation. "Only a few final touches are being given. The sites should be ready by Tuesday." Shyam Sundar Aggarwal, mayor of EDMC added, "Work is under way at the puja sites designated by the state government and all of them will be ready soon." The corporations are coordinating with Delhi government's flood & irrigation department to dig pits on government and private lands to create artificial ponds and are carrying out fogging and cleaning of the sites. Tankers will come with water for these artificial ponds, which will be refilled with mud after the festival. All the district administrations have been holding meetings with the Chhath puja committees in areas under their jurisdiction to chart out plans to celebrate the religious event without flouting the Covid protocols laid out by DDMA. To ensure compliance with the Covid norms, including social distancing and face masks, Delhi government has deployed Civil Defence personnel at the popular Chhath ghats. Access to the Yamuna riverbanks has been stopped with police barricades and Civil Defence volunteers steering devotees away. Posters warning people against congregating on the riverbanks have been put up at many places. Javed, a Civil Defence volunteer at Yamuna ghat near ITO, told TOI, "We have been given orders to not allow the people to carry out the Chhath rituals because DDMA has banned the puja near the river. A few women did arrive here to celebrate the sun puja, but we politely asked them to go to some other place." Police had barricaded the entrance to the ghat, with a message warning visitors not to celebrate the festival at the spot. Delhi: Toxic foam floats on Yamuna; devotees dip in for Chhath pujaThe situation was similar at the ghat at Kalindi Kunj, where volunteers posted at the entrance asked the people for identification and the purpose of their visit before letting them through. On Monday, only authorised personnel were permitted beyond the entrance. "Clear orders have been given to us by the district magistrate to not allow the public to gather and carry out the rituals near the river for the next two-three days," said a volunteer there. "More officials will be posted here from Tuesday. I think the devotees are aware by now that they cannot show up at the ghats on the Yamuna." The timing of the duties of the Civil Defence volunteers will change from November 10. They will be on duty from 3 in the afternoon and keep vigil through the night till 11 the next morning. The main puja begins at dawn on November 11. The district administrations are creating awareness among the devotees about the DDMA restrictions and encouraging people to celebrate the festival with all necessary Covid protocols like masks, social distancing, etc. Delhi government claimed in a statement on Monday that it was due to the personal efforts of CM Kejriwal that lieutenant governor Anil Baijal was compelled to permit the organisation of Chhath puja in public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/many-newly-dug-ponds-in-800-sites-for-chhath-puja-in-delhi/articleshow/87595350.cms||Alok KN Mishra

The government aims to to start distribution of the jabs by December once supplies start flowing in. The pricing includes Rs 265 per dose of ZyCoV-D plus Rs 93 for a needle-free applicator or a jet injector, which pressurises liquid medication into a narrow stream that is capable of penetrating the skin. Zydus had earlier proposed a price of Rs 1,900 for its three-dose regimen. However, the government managed to bring down the price significantly following rigorous negotiations with the firm. The government has been procuring Serum Institute’s Covishield at Rs 215 per dose, whereas Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin costs Rs 225 per dose. Zy-Cov-D — the world’s first DNA vaccine — will be given on day zero, day 28 and day 56.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/3-shot-zydus-vax-to-cost-rs-358-a-dose/articleshow/87595352.cms||---

Delhi Police has registered 1,429 rape cases till October 31 in 2020, while it has filed 1,725 cases in the corresponding period this year. Registration of cases of molestation increased by 20.43% with 2,157 cases reported this year compared with 1,791 last year. This rise is being seen as a result of post-Covid opening up as the numbers are in sync with the data of 2019 and previous years, police sources say. Between January and October last year, Delhi had witnessed a 28% fall in the number of rape cases over 2019. Similarly, molestation cases had gone down by 32.91% and cases of outraging a woman's modesty had dipped by 18.51%. Police chief Rakesh Asthana wants a zero-tolerance policy on crimes against women. Accused known to survivors in over 97% of rape cases, shows police data In 2019, 2,168 rape cases were reported between January and December, while the number came down to 1699 last year, a fall of around 21%. In 2020, 2,344 combined cases of kidnapping and abductions - registered separately based on nature of complaint and age of victims - of women were registered in Delhi. Many of these cases are that of elopement or of teenagers running away from home after fighting with their parents. This year, 3,342 such cases have been registered. There has also been an increase of 6.5% in cases registered under 'outraging modesty' with 373 cases registered this year against 350 last year. As per the data, the accused were known to the victims in over 97% cases, while rapes by strangers stood at around 2%. The newly-appointed police chief, Rakesh Asthana, has asked senior police officials to have a zero-tolerance policy against crimes against women. All district DCPs have beem asked to directly supervise the investigation in rape cases with extra attention to the cases where victims are minors. A study has been carried out to map areas which reported more crime against women and measures are being taken accordingly, officials said. Civic agencies have been instructed to make proper lighting arrangments in dark patches of the city. Offices where women work late at night have been told to take proper safety measures, said police. "All-women PCR vans have been stationed outside market places and in areas often frequented by women, including schools and colleges. Awareness programmes are being conducted in various areas and survivors are being encouraged to come forward and report any incident without fear. Registration of any complaint is being done on the basis of their statement and probe initiated accordingly," a senior police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rape-molestation-cases-up-20-in-delhi-this-year/articleshow/87595386.cms||---

AICC state incharge Harish Chaudhury held a meeting with CM Charanjit Channi and Sidhu on Monday, after the latter’s yet another offensive against the state government. Chaudhury also had a meeting with AICC general secretary KC Venugopal. There was also a meeting of a senior party office bearer with Congress president Sonia Gandhi, it is learnt. “There should be a movement on the issue tomorrow. It may be settled for good,“ a senior leader said. Sidhu also served an ultimatum to the Punjab government while reiterating his demand for the removal of state DGP IPS Sahota and advocate general APS Deol. “Either you choose the two compromised officers or the PPCC chief,” he said.

---||Hyderabad||Meet Pulakita Hasvi, the 13-year-old Hyderabadi girl who scaled Mt. Kilimanjaro||Most kids her age spent the last year-and- a-half trying to cope with virtual schooling amid the pandemic, but 13-year-old Muriki Pulakita Hasvi was busy scaling some of the world’s tallest summits. The Hyderabad girl recently scaled Mt. Kilimanjaro (5895M), after months of rigorous training under extreme weather conditions. The ninth grader, who took eleven days to scale the peak (from September 28 to October 8), says it was a life-changing experience. “Since I was a little girl, I’ve always been interested in sports. Badminton, cycling, cricket, skating, I’ve played them all. When I watched the film Everest earlier this year, I was inspired by it and wanted to take up mountaineering. After staying cooped up at home for several months during the pandemic, heading to the mountains was just the escape I needed,” says Hasvi, excitedly. Her parents, Madhavi C Murali and Venkat Satyanayana Murali, were apprehensive when she told them about her plans to take up mountaineering. “They were initially scared but when they realised I was serious about this, they encouraged me and helped me train for this,” says Hasvi. Along with the online classes for her school, Hasvi began attending classes for mountaineering too. “Walking, consistency, endurance and energy are key to it. So a week before heading to Kilimanjaro, I was asked to train from 11 PM to 5:30 AM to not just get fit but also train myself to not fall asleep, as the trek to the summit starts from midnight and goes till 1:30 PM,” she explains, adding, “It was not easy to walk with 3 kgs of weight strapped to my back and legs. And for months leading up to it, I began taking my diet seriously, cut sugar, ate more protein and worked out as much as I could.” Travelling during the pandemic was additional challenge for Hasvi, who flew to Tanzania as soon as international travel opened up. “My trip was initially scheduled for September but South Africa hadn’t opened up for international travellers, so we had to wait till things opened up. I had to travel from Hyderabad to Mumbai and from there to Dar Es Salaam (Tanzania). I was extra cautious and wore gloves, masks, used sanitiser throughout my journey. We had a COVID-19 test done at a tiny village near Kilimanjaro and thankfully, I tested negative and was able to proceed.” While Hasvi did all she could to prepare physically, it was only towards end of the trek that she realised she needed to be mentally strong too. “The first few days were good, I was able to push myself to get to where I needed. But then the weather deteriorated, I felt dehydrated and many of my teammates headed back because they felt sick,” she recollects, adding, “I also had the choice to return back from Gilman’s Point. I was told I could always return back some day in the future to complete it. From there, you can see the peak of Kilimanjaro, it’s near enough but not easy reach. I made the decision to push myself, took on the ascending terrain and completed it.” The teenager, who enjoyed the experience of scaling her first summit, has her sights set on the seven summit challenge. “I want to scale all the seven summits, with Kilimanjaro down, there’s six more to go (Aconcagua, Denali, Mt. Elbrus, Puncak Jaya and Mt Vinson). Starting with Mt. Elbrus, which I will take on next year,” she adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/meet-pulakita-hasvi-the-13-year-old-hyderabadi-girl-who-scaled-mt-kilimanjaro/articleshow/87587724.cms||Neeshita Nyayapati

Rajib Mondal, 32, had joined the paramilitary force in 2010. He had last come home on October 8. “Now, he will return in a coffin,” a Jompukur villager said. Mondal is survived by his parents, two brothers, wife and two daughters aged three and five. “He (Mondal) called me last (Sunday) night around 9 o’clock. We spoke on general issues. He told me he would leave the gate around 3am before we ended our conversation. This morning, I was told he had been shot,” said Sulekha, his wife of 10 years. The jawan’s grieving mother said: “I received a phone call around 7am (Monday). Someone was speaking in Hindi. Since I don’t understand Hindi, I requested him to speak in Bengali. Another man started talking in Bengali. He wanted to know if I was Rajib’s mother. He wanted to talk to my husband. My husband was not home. I handed over the phone to one of my sons. My son fainted on hearing the news.” According to a neighbour, Mondal’s first posting was in Kashmir. “He survived treacherous terrain and greater risks; never got injured. And now, he dies at the hands of a colleague at a CRPF camp,” the neighbour said. The family is waiting for the body to arrive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/crpf-jawan-spoke-to-his-wife-hours-before-he-was-killed/articleshow/87593897.cms||Ashis Poddar
---||Kolkata||Bengal BJP ups the ante over slashing of VAT on fuel prices||Kolkata: A Bengal BJP rally planned to demand slashing of VAT on fuel prices by the state government, following the decrease in excise rates on petrol and diesel, finally turned into a protest gathering in front of the BJP state headquarters at Muralidhar Sen Lane on Monday after police denied it permission over Covid restrictions. Party seniors decried the silence of the Mamata Banerjee government over reduction of VAT rates that has made petrol and diesel prices in Bengal costlier than those in neighbouring Assam and Bihar, like a total 22 states that have slashed VAT rates on fuel prices to pass on the benefits to the commoner. The Bengal BJP has planned a one-hour silent protest in front of all petrol pumps in the state from 11 am on Tuesday. “BJP workers will carry placards displaying excise rates on fuel by the Centre and the VAT rates charged by the state government to tell consumers how the state government has been making money,” Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar said. Leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari urged BJP workers to continue with the protest against high electricity bills in Bengal and also for filling up 4.5 lakh vacant state government posts. “I appeal to the educated youth to hit the streets on this demand with ‘bhata noi, chakri chai’ (no dole, we want jobs) slogan when the BJP-run government in Uttar Pradesh is filling up 10 lakh vacant posts,” Adhikari said to project BJP as the main opposition in the state when Congress and CPM, he claimed, were arriving at a “setting” with TMC. There was tension in the afternoon when police barricaded access to the BJP office with guard rails on either side, barring access to Central Avenue and also the approach from Hindu Hostel. “Trinamool and its police get vigilant about Covid whenever BJP plans a rally. They gloss over the scene when a Trinamool MLA takes out a cow cart to protest against the Centre over fuel prices. It shows that TMC is afraid of BJP, which is why they are trying to prevent the rally,” said Majumdar. The Bengal BJP president reminded that CM Banerjee had written to the PM to cut down on excise rates on fuel. “The PM did it. Now, it is Trinamool’s turn. We will make them do that,” Majumdar said. BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh pointed out how transporters in Alipurduar were tanking fuel from Assam and those from Uttar Dinajpur from neighbouring Bihar. “Even Congress-ruled Punjab has slashed VAT rates on fuel. But Bengal isn’t waking up. The economy is looking up. The Centre has mopped up Rs 1.4 lakh crore as GST, of which a part goes to the states, including Bengal. Let Bengal follow the 22 states that have reduced tax rates,” Ghosh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-bjp-ups-the-ante-over-slashing-of-vat-on-fuel-prices/articleshow/87593950.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Mamata: Centre earned 4L-cr by raising fuel, gas prices||Kolkata: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday accused the Centre of earning Rs 4 lakh crores by raising petrol, diesel and gas prices. Not referring to the several BJP-governed states that have slashed VAT, she said, “They give states governed by them thousands of crores. They don’t even give vaccines to us, let’s not talk of funds. They only talk big.” Banerjee said despite meagre resources, Bengal had announced a Re 1/litre cut in state taxes on both petrol and diesel back in February. “There is a pressing problem. Prices of petrol, diesel and gas are spiralling every day. This is escalating prices everywhere. People’s money is getting choked because they must spend more on fuel. Banks are unable to do adequate transactions. They are selling off SAIL, RAIL, Coal (India) and BHEL. This will only increase unemployment and therefore poverty,” she said. “If the price of diesel increases, farming costs go up. The farmers need diesel. We give a concession of Re 1 per litre of diesel. Where will we get the money? Despite the financial constraints, we give such concessions ... It’s natural that prices of day-to-day commodities will go up if the price of diesel goes up every day.” Banerjee was speaking at the Biswa Bangla Convention Centre while handing the Sharad Samman awards. The Re-1 slash by the Bengal government on petrol and diesel meant Bengal losing around Rs 50 crore per month. The total demand for petrol in the state is around 1.2 lakh kilo litres per month, while that of diesel is around 3 lakh KL. The taxes in petroleum products include customs duty, excise duty, cess and sales tax. There was also an additional excise duty along with countervailing duties (CVD). The central components of the taxes are more than that of the state. There was a lump sum (fixed tax on quantity) tax of Re 1/litre on both petrol and diesel in the state, along with sales tax of 17% and 25% on diesel and petrol. The Bengal government withdrew the lump sum tax from 2018 to March 2020. The CM asked from where could she give more concessions. Pointing out how the Bengal government invested in social inclusive programmes, she said no one could match the state in the social sector. Banerjee said from health to education all was free in Bengal, which was unthinkable earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mamata-centre-earned-4l-cr-by-raising-fuel-gas-prices/articleshow/87593911.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Rich tributes paid to friend & guide Subrata in assembly||Kolkata: Ministers Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, Partha Chatterjee and Manas Bhunia could not conceal their emotions on Monday while paying rich tributes to their former ministerial colleague and political friend, philosopher and guide Subrata Mukherjee. Leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari too remembered Mukherjee warmly. “Subrata Mukherjee will be relevant in Bengal politics for a long long time,” Adhikari said. “He never allowed politics to change the personal relationship. As I moved to another political party, he maintained the same warmth. I have been seeing him as my family friend since my childhood as he travelled to our house numerous times,” he added. Earlier, Sobhandeb broke into tears while remembering his friend since 1967. “We quarrelled a lot, but our friendship remained intact even when we belonged to rival political parties. I cannot think of my life without Subrata,” he said. With Mukherjee’s demise, the curtain has fallen on a political chapter, the Bengal agriculture minister added. Recalling a recent interaction, Sobhandeb said: “He came to my room in the assembly after the last cabinet meeting before Puja. He demanded an adda with me. So I asked everyone to leave the room. He told me he needed to share something that he could not even share with his wife Chhandabani. When he first filed his candidature from Ballygunge, he had used Supriya’s (Sobhandeb’s wife) address.” In the hour and half of tribute, Partha Chatterjee, whose voice choked with emotion, and Manas Bhunia too recollected their long association with Mukherjee and how he had influenced their political trajectory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rich-tributes-paid-to-friend-guide-subrata-in-assembly/articleshow/87594006.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal BJP writes to SEC for single-day civic polls||Kolkata: The Bengal BJP has written to the State Election Commission (SEC) urging notification of civic polls at one go, when the state government is keen on phased elections. “It has come to our knowledge that the state government is trying to influence State Election Commission to notify dates of elections in a few municipal bodies (not more than three) where the ruling party has a strong support base and where they expect good results. The purpose is to influence voters in other municipalities,” the BJP letter said. On Monday, Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar said: “We want civic polls at one go because elections to some municipal bodies have been pending since 2018. It is apparent from our demand that we can field candidates in all municipal seats.” Majumdar’s remark came hours after BJP veteran Tathagata Roy feared the party couldn’t field candidates in all municipalities. The state BJP chief also said SEC should hold the counting on a single day even if elections were held in phases. Petitioner Mousumi Roy on Monday moved the Calcutta High Court urging elections to all municipalities and municipal corporations in a day. Her counsel Sabyasachi Chatterjee submitted that the court had passed a directive to SEC on similar lines ahead of the assembly polls held earlier this year. The court fixed the hearing for November 17.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-bjp-writes-to-sec-for-single-day-civic-polls/articleshow/87594116.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

All three accused, who belong to the same community, were arrested on Monday morning. The girl’s mother said: “My daughter was sleeping at home. She was somehow picked up from her bed and taken to a nearby abandoned house. I woke up only when she returned to the bedroom. I immediately ran to the house and chased those men but they managed to flee. I raised an al-arm but no one came to help.” The survivor identified the youths as residents of a neighbouring village. The girl, a Class-IX student, said that one of them picked her up from her room while she was in deep sleep and took her to the house, where the others were waiting. Three men, including the one who had abducted her, raped her. She fought them and managed to escape. A complaint was lodged against five persons, three of whom were accused of rape. Police sent the survivor for a medical test. Birbhum Police superintendent Nagendranath Tripathi said: “Three accused were arrested on the basis of the complaint. An investigation has begun.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/class-ix-tribal-girl-raped-by-3-in-birbhum/articleshow/87594086.cms||---

This would be the sixth edition of the summit. The last was in February 2019, after which it had become a once-in-two-years event. But the 2021 edition had to be cancelled because of the Covid pandemic. The chief minister also requested governor Jagdish Dhankar, who was present, to visit a foreign country to showcase Bengal for BGBS. “I visited some foreign countries like Italy and Germany to showcase Bengal. I would request you to visit a country for the state, if you could,” she added. In the last BGBS, there were 12 partner countries and over 450 foreign delegates from 35 countries in attendance. The partner countries were Japan, Italy, Poland, Germany, Republic of Korea, Czech Republic, Great Britain, France, Luxembourg, Australia, Finland and the United Arab Emirates. A major outcome of the summit was the ‘State to State partnerships’ signed between Bengal and Lombardy Regional province, Italy; North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany; and Jeollanam Do Province, Republic of Korea, towards fostering industry, infrastructure, education and skill development. Major multinationals, such as Alstom, Accor, D P World, IKEA, Capgemini, Decathlon, Schneider Electric, Oerlikon, Metro, Sharaf Group, IBM, Dell, BT, P&G were present at the summit.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Extended Covaxin life helps avert jab waste||KOLKATA: The central drug regulator’s move to extend the shelf life of Covaxin by six months will help city private hospitals avert wastage of several thousand doses of the indigenous Covid vaccine that were set to expire over the next eight weeks. The vaccine, which finally got an emergency-use approval from WHO last week, had a very slow off-take in recent months leaving hospitals with a huge stockpile they were struggling to use up. The WHO nod will now allow Indians administered the vaccine to travel to countries where it was so far not recognised and is expected to boost demand The AMRI Hospitals’ entire stock of 4,800 doses were to expire in November while the 500 doses with Peerless Hospitals were set to expire in early-December. The 7,000 doses with Woodlands Hospitals, too, were to expire soon. These apart, numerous other private vaccine centres are left with unused Covaxin vials worth lakhs of rupees. “We had started discussing how to salvage Covaxin stocks at private CVCs, that were to expire in November. The extension is a relief to us as well as the private centres,” said a health official. The Bengal government on Monday had around 14 lakh Covaxin doses in its stores while an additional 10 lakh doses arrived on Tuesday. For the past few days, the vaccine was being used only for second doses. “Since we have got fresh stock, we will start offering first dose of Covaxin to recipients at government-run CVCs. All districts have been informed,” said Ashim Das Malakar, state family welfare officer. Of the total 8.13 crore doses of Covid vaccines administered across Bengal so far, only a little over 88 lakh have been Covaxin. Other than being not recognized by WHO till last week, the supply of the vaccine, too, has been slow and erratic, the government officials said. Peerless Hospital is saddled with 500 doses of Covaxin but the daily use has been less than 10 for several months. Often, it has been zero. “Our Covaxin stocks would have expired this month and we were staring at a loss. The DCGI decision will let use up the entire stock since we expect a rise in demand over the next few months. Not only has Covaxin been recognized by WHO, a third booster dose now seems imminent which will see a spike in demand for vaccines again,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. The AMRI Hospitals are left with 4,800 doses of Covaxin worth Rs 50 lakh. “The extension comes as a relief since we will now be able to use up at least a major portion of the stock. But it could still be difficult to use the entire stock unless the government starts vaccinating under-18 recipients. Covaxin still has very few takers for it is more expensive than Covishield,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. Some hospitals like Medica Superspecialty and RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) have already exhausted their Covaxin stocks and have decided not to procure more till the demand increases. “We have a few vials left which should now be used up. But we have no plans to acquire more,” said Medica chairperson Alok Roy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/extended-covaxin-life-helps-avert-jab-waste/articleshow/87594608.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

After the inauguration of Kartarpur corridor, its management was awarded to a private company, but it has no interference in the religious affairs of Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, he said. The Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) has a role in the religious affairs of the shrine, he added. In conversation with TOI on the eve of the second anniversary of Kartarpur corridor, Latif explained the role of PMU in managing the Sikh place of worship. What is the role of PMU, Kartapur, in managing Gurdwara Darbar Sahib and Kartapur corridor complex? On the completion and inauguration of Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, Kartarpur, on November 9, 2019, Global Nobel company was awarded the contract for its operation and management till October 31, 2021. The company was to provide best possible services to pilgrims visiting Gurdwara Darbar Sahib but had zero interference in its rituals, which were purely looked after by the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) and ETPB. Now, the ministry of religious affairs and interfaith harmony has constituted PMU, Kartarpur, which is purely a civil body and has replaced Global Nobel. The primary aim of PMU, Kartarpur, is to ensure efficient operations and management of Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur corridor. It will provide the best possible services to visiting yatris (pilgrims) and executing the development projects of phase II. Why was a Sikh not appointed the CEO of PMU, whose primary objective is to look after a Sikh religious body? The PMU, a so-called ‘Non-Sikh Body’, takes pride in serving our Sikh and Hindu Nanak Naamleva brothers from across the world. All its vacancies, including that of the CEO, were advertised and applications invited for various posts by the ministry. The recruitment process has been completed on open merit and PMU has taken over the operations and management of Gurdwara Darbar Sahib from November 1, 2021. PMU is working under the administrative control of ETPB while PSGPC continues to be the supreme religious body, to look after the rituals inside Gurdwara Darbar Sahib. Out of 125 posts of PMU, 34 are exclusively for Sikhs, who were interviewed and appointed by the PSPGC president and members. About 20 other employees are Christians and Hindus. As CEO of PMU, will you recommend waiver of US $20 service fee, visa requirement and entry permit upon arrival? As far as levying of service charges of US $20 for pilgrims from India is concerned, it is part of the MOU signed between the two governments (India and Pakistan). Service charges notwithstanding, Indian Sikh community is desperately looking forward to the reopening of the corridor to realise their lifetime dream of visiting Kartarpur Sahib. Frequent people-to-people contact between the two countries will be mutually beneficial as part of the much-needed confidence-building measures and easing up artificial hatred. ETPB and PMU will continue to strive for developing the gurdwara as the most preferred destination for tourists coming from across the world, irrespective of their caste, creed and religion; making it a true symbol of interfaith harmony and mutual respect for humanity. It is said that Sikh scholars are trying to find the exact place where Baba Nanak used to live in Kartarpur Sahib. What is the progress so far? Historians, researchers from India, Pakistan and other nationalities have been trying to find out the exact location of Baba Guru Nanak Dev’s house. Unfortunately, no one has been able to determine it. As Kartarpur is located on the bank of Buddha Ravi, it is believed that all kutcha infrastructure must have been washed away by frequent floods. However, keeping in view the proximity of Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, Kunwan (well) Sahib and Baba Nanak’s agriculture land, it is believed that Baba Nanak’s house was located inside the present Gurdwara Darbar Gahib complex. However, PMU will continue its efforts to discover and revive all the sacred places associated with Baba Guru Nanak Dev.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pmu-purely-a-civil-body-to-ensure-efficient-running-of-gurdwara-darbar-sahib-kartarpur-corridor/articleshow/87593912.cms||Yudhvir Rana
